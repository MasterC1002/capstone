**Plate tectonics - the wilson cycle** 

Plate tectonics are one of the most important factors in how continents look. Now you all know the basic principle behind that but there is something a bit more complicated you probably have never heard of: its called **the wilson cycle**. Pictures here under CC-BY-SA by Hannes Grobe

The wilson cycle describes a **recurring series of tectonic events**.

1. You start with an old continent. Since it is so old
2. [Embryonic stage.](http://i.imgur.com/GYY3PBs.png) From the lower parts of the earth
3. [Juvenile stage.](http://i.imgur.com/B6SMvuI.png) The continent breaks apart. The middle part fills up with heavy material from all the volcanoes and sinks down. Its then filled with water. **This is the beginning of a new ocean.** You see it happening in the red sea. Just like the red sea you still have **a lot of vulcanism all around**. The placement of the volcanoes is not random. [It looks like this.](http://i.imgur.com/m3bj2pL.png) In the middle of the three lines
4. [Mature stage.](http://i.imgur.com/uwRaQZD.png) The mid ocean ridge continues to produce a ton of material. The land on both ends is pushed outwards
5. [Declining stage.](http://i.imgur.com/AMsPgKh.png) The land to both sides is no longer pushed outwards. Actually its pushed inwards, you get what is called an **subduction zone**. Everywhere where you have a subduction zone, like the pacific ring of fire, you get **tons of volcanism**. the volcanism here is **explosive**. This has geochemical reasons that arent that important. 
6. [Terminal stage.](http://i.imgur.com/yf74pex.png) The friction can  cause **mountains to rise**. Those mountains are made out of **seabed and volcanic material**, etc. The reason is that all the lime that has been deposited by your coral reefs is now getting pushed upwards.
7. [Surturing stage.](http://i.imgur.com/k6niQwX.png) **Think himalaja**. Two continents collide. Really big mountains form. When you look at the rocks in the picture
- stuff that was once on the left continent
- eroded stuff from the first mountains that formed in stage 2-6
- volcanic rocks
- seabed materials
- stuff that was once on the right continent

**So what the hell does this mean for worldbuilding**

- You will always get big geological systems. that means that mountains and other geological features over large areas will have the same directions. [Look at this map of germany](http://i.imgur.com/bf8C0sY.jpg). Red stuff is salt
- Mountains, and they are right at the lower edge of europe, close to the meditarrean.
- Volcanoes are not randomly placed

_______________________
**Erosion and transport**

Erosion is what makes small rocks from big rocks and mountains. There are many different forms of erosion and what exactly they are isnt really that important. What is important are different forms of transport. Lets start with 

**water**:

- Higher stuff erodes faster
- Stuff gets transported from high to low
- **Water makes stuff round**
- Big stuff is harder to transport than small stuff, you have a lot of big stuff lying around, but later, when the river flows more slowly, the maximum size of stuff it can transport gets smaller and smaller. So if you are close to mountains, you get a ton gravel and the like, but the farhter away from the mountains you get, until at the end you have only sand
- When rivers transport a lot of material you get stuff called [alluvial fans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alluvial_fan) close to mountains. This is where a lot of the coarse material is deposited. Deltas are similar

**Glaciers**

- Ice can transport everything. Even whole blocks of mountains. 
- **Glaciers dont sort** you find really big
- **Rivers change path** when next to glaciers
- When glaciers melt
- Land that was eroded by glaciers recently shows **very steep inclines**. You dont normally get that. For example fjords look like they do because of glaciers.

**Wind**

- Wind can transport **fine sediment over long distances** in germany we have dust from africa.
- Depending on ground and wind speed
- **Wind tends to make stuff edged and matte**


**So what the hell does this mean for worldbuilding**
- The history of your world changes the way your world looks. 
- Different parts of your world will have different soil. 
- Rivers dont look the same everywhere
- **Everything is connected**. You will find sediments from the mountain spring where the river flows into the ocean.

______________________________

**Types of rock**

**Sedimentary**

sedimentary rocks are everything that was once a sediment. A sediment is every grain that is not part of the underlying rock anymore. So gravel, dust, thats all sediment. I can think of four really important major types of sedimentary rocks

- Biological sediments: limestone. Limestone is largely deposited by algae in reefs and such. So its only deposited in **shallow water**. There are also rocks which are literally made up out of seashells. Its always grey
- **Sandstone**: its made up out of.. well, but way smaller. Sandstone give you nice stratas that can be made up out of different sand-compositions. So one layer might be brittle, the next one not. That is caused by **periodic events like flooding**.
- Chemical sediments: thats stuff like salt. Basically Oceans evaporate and leave salt behind. Salt can be deformed so it actually changes its shape underground and slowly rises up.
- 'Fossilized gravel''. Its not actually called that way

**Volcanic**

Volcanic rocks are formed by volcanic activity. They can be either solid chunks like **basalt** or sediments like **ash**. Some volcanoes explode, rhyolite. The more terrestrial crust the magma has molten until it erupts, the more likely it is to explode. Hawaii is made up from magma that comes straigt from the mantle, so it just flows. 

Volcanic rocks cool down very fast so you get **some medium big crystals in very fine matrix**.

**Plutonic**

Plutonic rocks are made from magma, so you get **very big nice crystals**. For example **granite**.

**Metamorphic**

Either of the above, crystals will grow or get absorbed. You get things that look almost like layered sediments but its actually plutonic rocks put under pressure.



_______________________________-

**Basic climate geography**

If your planet rotates the same way earth does

The most important part is probably that the wind comes from west

Temperature is obviously dependend on your latitude. That has something to do with **the angle between sun and surface**. The more of a right angle

**Precipation** mainly depends on how close you are to the sea. the closer you are

EDIT: regarding the world map, our planet). Next time, I'm going for realism point-for-point.

Oh

EDIT: a few have noted a slight similarity between this world and the Discovery Channel mini-series The Future is Wild--I know. And though I've never seen it (it had already stopped showing) that's what it was very lightly based upon. I've written in one of my comments below a few differences between TFIW and Samitola.

""

* TFIW uses a different hypothetical supercontinent known as Novopangaea wherein all the continents fused. The hypothetical continent I used is Pangaea Ultima, India and Asia, and a smaller continent to the south formed by Australia colliding with Antarctica.

* Fish aren't aerial. I found the idea a little unrealistic, like my sapients, but belong to a different taxonomic family.

* I wasn't too sure about hopping snails. There had to be a different life form to develop my herbivores--and I realized they could be descended from mudskippers. They would be biologically different from the vertebrates we know now, which are bipedal, and their namesake refers to the cranial placement of their lungs instead of in their chest, a holdover from mudskipper gills. The ipachya pictured in the tab ""Pre-sapient Ecological Niche"" is an example. Besides them, vertebrates as we know them are extinct in this world.

* Their molluscs didn't have skeletal structures, and though they couldn't reach sizes as large as vertebrates could (due to the fact that keratin is less sturdier than calcium carbonate bones), it is enough for them to live in the dry dessert environment.

Supercontinents tend to have global deserts, so did old Pangaea, and had a [dead zone](http://www.bitsofscience.org/wordpress-3.0.1/wordpress/images/2012/10/triassic-dead-zone.jpg) around the equator which was too hot for life, separating organisms between the northern and southern hemispheres.

1373468987.0,1i0eq6,Flagbuilding - A Guide To Flag Design for Worldbuilders,TheBishopsBane,87,6,43,"I see a lot of maps in this subreddit, for those who are interested

&amp;nbsp;

### The Shape

Nowadays, most flags will have a straight edge along their top or left side so they can be hung or flown from a pole, but the shape can be rectangular, triangular, swallowtailed, or anything else you like. Once you've settled on an outside shape, we can start designing the insides.

&amp;nbsp;

### Divisions Of The Field

Very often

* halving horizontally
* halving vertically
* halving diagonally
* halving by chevron (vertically separated by a ^ shape)
* parting into three in a Y shape
* quartering diagonally (like an X)
* quartering horizontally and vertically (like a cross)
* [full list with fancy names here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of_the_field)

The separations do not have to be by straight line either. You can divide using waves, check out wikipedia's article on [Lines of Division](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_%28heraldry%29#Gallery_of_different_lines_of_partition)

Rather than simply dividing two colours, checkers or any other repeating pattern of shapes.

&amp;nbsp;

###Colours

A basic rule-of-thumb when designing a flag is to keep the number of main colours to 2 or 3. This helps keep the colors bold and distinctive and keeps the design from looking too cluttery. Most countries attribute meaning to each of the colours in their flag

* **Red:** war, courage, revolution, valor. The most common color in all national flags.
* **White:** peace
* **Blue:** freedom, ocean. 
* **Yellow/Gold:** sun, agriculture (wheat).
* **Green:** earth, fertility.
* **Black:** death

The [Rule Of Tincture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_tincture) is an old Heraldic rule which essentially prevents colors of similar brightness appearing next to each other. It specifically applies to the colour of symbols and objects with respect to the field of a coat of arms, or blue on black). If you really want to use similar colours, consider a [fimbriation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fimbriation) (a fancy word for stripe) dividing the two (a great example are the white stripes on the [flag of Kenya](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Kenya))

&amp;nbsp;

###Charges

A charge on a flag or coat-of-arms is simply any emblem or device on the field. It might be a simple shape like a star or cross

* Crosses and Saltires (x shapes)
* Stars
* Crowns and Sceptres
* Anchors
* Lions
* Swords, and other weapons

The number and position of your charge may be just as important as the charge itself: three crowns may indicate a union of three kingdoms

&amp;nbsp;

###Some basic DOs and DONTs

You should strive to make your flag unique

* **DO NOT use any words or text**. Writing the name of the country defeats the purpose of using the flag as an identifying symbol. Dates and mottos are only slightly less bad, you probably can't make out the words anyway.

* **DO NOT use seals or logos**. Seals are often highly complex and contain intricate details that are both difficult to manufacture and impossible to see. Save them for closing your letters in wax.

* **DO NOT use gradients or drop shadows**. Just don't. Obviously it's impractical to manufacture

* **DO borrow from the best**. Study other flags. Figure out what you like about them and what you don't.

* **DO keep it simple**. A common saying is that a flag should be simple enough that a child could draw it from memory. While some charges can be a bit more complex, or three background colors with a large, single charge is more than enough to make a unique, distinctive, and great looking flag.

Hi everyone! First post to worldbuilding. The Civ Worldbuilder has been posted a couple times before

When you start up the Worldbuilder, and world age (younger = more vertical terrain that hasn't been worn down). You can also choose what types of landmasses it should randomly generate. Some of these options include fractal, which creates thinner, snakier continents, and a ""continents"" option, which essentially creates landmasses like the ones I have in this post.

Examples of continents: [Map1] (http://i.imgur.com/LMVRdtB.jpg)

After you generate your map, plains, etc.), add features (forest, hills, rivers, etc.), copper

[Here's an example of my desert for a pseudo-egyptian civilization

[And here's a close-up of the location for a polynesian seafaring culture.] (http://i.imgur.com/u9RZwOK.jpg)

You can also place roads and natural wonders like the ""fountain of youth"" in the depth of the forest like [here](http://i.imgur.com/OTtLaY6.jpg). I have also placed some city ruins and an ""El Dorado"" natural wonder deep in the jungle mountains down by my polynesian civ.

Next

You can then place cities and determine which buildings their city has. [Example for my Seafaring civ.] (http://i.imgur.com/gD0zDLn.jpg) It also adds city names according to the civilization. 

---

[And here's a relatively finished product] (http://i.imgur.com/Iibpunu.jpg) of what my world turned out like. The black and green/white city names on each side of Dalstead/Achford are City-States that my main civilizations would interact with

Another cool thing about the worldbuilder is the oil, so in the case of a medieval fantasy story, it's something that isn't recognized for what it is and basically remains a hidden part of the world that makes it a bit deeper for the audience.

Questions and comments are appreciated. Thanks for your time everybody!

So, I don't really have a lot of time. Rather than handcrafting each city and point of interest, I decided to take care of the legwork by designing a few simple 'algorithms' to try and 'grow' a world.

[This is the end result

The first thing I did is make some continents using World Machine. I picked one that I thought looked nice and picked that as my 'starting ground'.

[The Map](http://i.imgur.com/mZoYKi2.jpg)

I then created a 16x16 grid overlay and used a few more perlin noise functions to generate four types of natural resources

[The Forests](http://i.imgur.com/xXgua7u.png)

[The Tech](http://i.imgur.com/ruTHDG1.jpg) (E.g.

[The Econ](http://i.imgur.com/Gmrofz2.jpg) (E.g.

[The Magic](http://i.imgur.com/gHyeg0U.jpg) (E.g.

I used a vague heuristic to determine where to place starting settlements:

&gt;Early Humans prioritize forest edge

&gt;Early Elves prioritize deep forest

&gt;Early Dwarves prioritize mountain top

&gt;Others prioritize plains

Using these 'rules'

[The Settlements](http://i.imgur.com/tflqz9R.jpg)

The settlements only cared about forests. My logic was that the earliest settlers wouldn't have ways of detecting natural resources, and the terrain.

After the settlements, bandits, environmental hazards, and other places that people would generally not want to go to. Because of their generic nature, they could go literally anywhere, and to create enough problems for the adventurers to solve, I placed them very liberally. The bright red spaces are 'big dangers'

[As so.](http://i.imgur.com/hTr1VlQ.jpg)

Each settlement was given three scores, and how their score was affected by them.

&gt;Humans: +3 from each adjacent resource

&gt;Elves: +2 from each adjacent tech/econ

&gt;Dwarves: +2 from each tech/econ up to three spaces away

&gt;Half-Orcs: +2 from each adjacent tech/econ.

&gt;Gnomes/Halflings: +1 from each adjacent resource.

I wrote up a list for each settlement and what their three scores were. This added up to a total resource score.

I also gave each settlement a danger score.

&gt;For all: 3 for danger within two spaces

Then I picked capitals. Different races had different capitals based on what I felt were the valued settlement qualities of those races.

&gt;Humans: National Capital (Tech + Econ)

&gt;Elves: Spiritual Capital (Magic)

&gt;Dwarves: Trade Capital (Econ)

&gt;Other: None

Then I assigned each settlement cultural policies

&gt;Humans: If score &gt; 5, Militaristic, else Diplomatic. If Scavenger and danger &gt; 5, Tribal. If score &gt; 25, if no danger, Arrogant, else Sympathetic.

&gt;Elves: If score &gt; 10, Sympathetic, else Timid. If score = 0 and danger &gt; 0, Tribal.

&gt;Dwarves: If danger &gt; 0, else Generous.

&gt;Half-Orcs: Tribal

&gt;Halflings/Gnomes: Curious

And then each settlement gets a culture score based on its combination of resources, and cultural policies.

&gt;+1 culture for each 5 of tech/econ/magic.

&gt;-2 culture for each 5 danger score.

&gt;+X culture for closest settlement. Starts at +5

&gt;+2 culture for each other settlement within 5 tiles.

--

&gt;Civilized: Double resource and close settlement culture.

&gt;Scavenger: Halve closest and close settlement culture.

&gt;Militaristic: Halve danger penalty.

&gt;Diplomatic: Triple closest and close settlement culture.

&gt;Tribal: Double closest and close settlement culture of the same race.

&gt;Arrogant: No culture from settlements with half resource score or less.

&gt;Sympathetic: Triple closest and close settlement culture for settlements with danger.

&gt;Secluded: Halve close settlement culture

&gt;Curious: Double culture from settlements with more of any resource.

&gt;Generous: Double culture from settlements with less of any resource.

&gt;Timid: Halve culture from settlements with more tech.

&gt;Xenophobic: No culture score from different races.

--

&gt;Double culture for capitals.

&gt;Round down.

Now

&gt;Each settlement with positive culture gets 1 road.

&gt;Each 10 culture = 1 more road.

And then a heuristic for determining where roads would lead. I placed them manually

&gt;Settlements build roads to the closest settlements.

&gt;Settlements don't consume roads building to settlements that have already built roads to them.

&gt;Roads will merge into other roads instead of crossing them.

To me, destitute settlements would have few roads at best.

Note: '1 road' meant the settlement would *initiate* a road. Roads already 'constructed' by higher-culture settlements won't 'use up' lower-culture settlements' roads.

[The Roadmap](http://i.imgur.com/foFV0vL.jpg)

And not every road would be the same

&gt;Roads that cross water get a dock at each endpoint. (Blue)

&gt;Roads connecting to Xenophobic settlements are downgraded to dirt. (Brown)

&gt;Roads connecting to settlements whose total culture is less than 10 are downgraded to dirt.

&gt;Interections with three or more connecting roads get a trading shanty at the intersection. (Gold)

&gt;Dwarven settlements connecting to Dwarven settlements go underground. (Gray)

&gt;Roads connecting to trading hubs can't be downgraded to dirt.

&gt;Roads connecting to capitals can't be downgraded to dirt unless one of those settlements is Xenophobic.

This led to the modified roadmap:

[This one.](http://i.imgur.com/NY1bqmy.jpg)

I'm going to be moving on to determining population percentages, and generating the actual makeup of each settlement. I haven't actually *programmed* any of this, but once I 'beta test' it with my playgroup, I'll heavily consider it.

# INKSCAPE
Inkscape is a free vector graphics program designed for web SVGs

## Freehand (free mouse?) drawing
While the inkscape pen tool supports curves, and click really fast while tracing the desired [coastline][IMG 2] (try not to click TOO fast, a perceived double click ends the path).

## Fractalize
The coastline I used in the above example looks too human, however, leave you with a very [node heavy line][IMG 6], so I like to [simplify][IMG 7] it [afterward][IMG 8]. If you still want the straight line look, you can subdivide ([one][IMG 9], [two][IMG 10] [three][IMG 11]) the nodes and straighten ([one][IMG 12], [two][IMG 13]

## Voronoi
If you need to split a region up into semi-random segments (tectonic plates, Inkscape's [voronoi extension][IMG 15] can come in useful. I like to crank up the size to something more [work-with-able][IMG 16]. The result: [this][IMG 17]. 

## Outset &amp; Inset
Outset and Inset are located under the Path menu [IMG 18]. I like to use them for a cartographic effect that I don't know the name of, [3] [IMG 21], [4] [IMG 22], [5] [IMG 23].

## Text on Path
Inkscape (and SVGs in general) have a handy text-on-path feature. To use this in inkscape, try [reversing][IMG 27] the path. [Much better][IMG 28]. Might want to [space it out][IMG 29] a bit though.

# PAINT DOT NET
Paint.NET is a (windows only

## Render Clouds
This is one of the backbones of map generating in PDN. It's located in [Effects -&gt; Render][PMG 1]. [This][PMG 2] is the result. To get a b/w map from this

## Gradient Map
If you've downloaded the pyrochild plugin

## Posterize ##
If I need to turn a smooth grayscale map (or anything else) into a ramped, [2][PMG 7], [3][PMG 8], [4][PMG 9]. That wasn't the best example, but you get the idea.

## Layers ##
So you've got some [layers][PMG 10] set up

Blending Modes:

* [Normal][PMG 11]: This takes a weighted average of two layers.

* [Multiply][PMG 12]: This multiplies the pixels of the bottom layer by the brightness of the top layer

* [Additive][PMG 13]: This adds the RGB of the layers. If the sum is greater than 255 it's truncated.

These are the most important to know

To make a detailed heightmap I usually try to use many layers and mix them until the map no longer looks generically random.

## Distort
When working with layers and also in general you can mix things up with the Effects -&gt; Distort menu. I'm not going to into depth with words, [frosted glass] [PMG 16]. Also, under Effects -&gt; Noise there's noise (pretty straight forward) and [Median][PMG 17] which is infinitely useful.

I present, going on two years now, at the Mythgard Institute (http://mythgard.org/), an online school dedicated to the study of genre literature in general and Tolkien in particular, where i am purusing a masters in Tolkien Studies. I am not, by any stretch of the imagination, an expert on Tolkien

My goal with this rant is to provide some background as to why and how Tolkien wrote about the elves

I do not believe it would be productive, i will focus on what we can know of his intentions. To that end, i would direct the interested reader to an essay he published in 1947 based on a lecture he gave in 1939 called ""On Fairy-Stories"". You can read about it here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Fairy_Stories or you can do a bit of googling and find the whole text. (truthfully, this should be required reading for worldbuilders ANYWAY since it, along with his poem Mythopoeia (http://home.ccil.org/~cowan/mythopoeia.html) are a call to arms and manifesto, so to speak, to what he called Subcreators but what we call worldbuilders) In this text he summarizes and describes fairy stories of the past and then puts forward his theory about what purpose these stories can serve: recovery, and consolation. It is the first of these that seems to have been the primary reason for this own elves. 

Tolkien's elves are a recovery of the epic heroes and the fairy myths that inspired him to write in the first place

People like to say that between Tolkien and his good friend Lewis, as one can see from his poem Mythopoeia Tolkien had a strong belief that as being made in the image of a Creator, the act of subcreation was not merely flight of fancy. He treated it with reverence. So it should not be any surprise, then, that he used his created world to examine and reflect on spiritual issues, recovering in effect those topics that challenged him. 

Chief among the tools that he used to do this, from their fall and salvation right down to the relationship of their souls to their bodies. While his intentions were absolutely literary as much as they were spiritual, one should not ignore these motivations when considering WHY Tolkien became so fascinated with his elves. They were not just heroes tragic and epic to him, more even than the recovery of fairy tale tropes and epic tales. 

Consequently, in your stories? are they there because they're elves and thats what fantasy has? or do they do something meaningful in the context of your world or story? Tolkien was as bad as ANY of us when it came to including things he thought were cool. Dragons, while he absolutely put them to excellent narrative use, were by his own admission simply too fucking cool not to include. His prolific language creation was a hinderance as much as a help, but he loved them so he included them at every turn. My point is not that you shouldn't include things that are cool, but i do STRONGLY believe that you should think carefully about adopting any of the traditional tropes, themes

tl;dr - Tolkien elves were a rich

It works in your standard tolkeinesque fantasy, would the dwarf kids learn as fast as the human kids? 

Anyway I wanted to share some of the things I have done to change elves and dwarves to make them fit in better with the shorter lived races.

**Elves -**
Elves go feral. Every 30-60 years an elf will lose their ability to reason and become a wild creature. This period lasts a few years, but the longer the feral period lasts.

The event is described by elves as a call from mother nature

While Feral the elf's behaviour is indicative of the kind of person they are. Some elves become solitary predators, but strong connections can survive the feral period.

Different tribes of elves have different traditions on how they treat their feral members, a new person. When elves society came into close and constant contact with other races, it became more common to create ""wildlife preserves"" or special parks in the city for their feral brethren to live. This protects the feral elves from other people, as well as the other way around.

-Human reactions
Humans are the ones who use the term feral. It has been a sore spot in Human/Elf relations for a while

**Dwarves-**
The children of the forge god are peculiar to most outsiders who do not know their history. Literally crafted by their god, become shaped into something more. This is more than a metaphor for the dwarves. Dwarf children are quick witted and impressionable, but as a dwarf ages, they become more and more set in their ways. This leads to very old dwarves becoming so entrenched in routine that they might as well be automatons. Dwarven society is structured and in fact engineered so that each person can act as a cog in a well oiled machine.

Dwarves are not doomed to becoming more and more static, repaired or changed from one thing to another. Dwarves call in ""the spark"" All the youth have it, and it fades as their lives become more and more routine, but through profound experiences a dwarves spark may be relit, and they may regain the flexibility of their youth. It turns out that this flexibility is a bit literal, as dwarves that have lived long enough without disruption turn to stone.

Many things can cause a spark in a dwarf

A dwarf that is ignited is a valuable resource, it an be reforged to a new tool, or just recast to give it a better edge. 

Dwarven is split between the traditionalists, while the hot council acts as devils advocate to try and find the parts of the law that are wearing thin. Dwarves do surprisingly well in mixed society, their steadfast natures cause them to end up being the backbone of many groups, be they farmers or aristocrats.

-Human reactions
Humans are actually fairly horrified by how dwarves ""cool"" It is like seeing a somebody one succumb to a mental disease. 

**Reasons-**
My elves are basically going through rebirth every so often
My dwarves are closer to classic interpretations, may be fresh out of being feral, but had no friends when he returned so set out for a new life. The 120 year old dwarf was a guard most of his life, when a goblin raid inspired him to take the battle to the monsters that threatened his home.

**What twists would you put on how fantasy races age?
What do you think of my ideas?**

**Traps**

[Traps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deccan_Traps) form when lava floods out in huge eruptions over an area the size of a medium sized nation.  These are basalt eruptions, if you catch things near an eruption.  But remember that volcanic soil is fertile, and for a geologist, once every thousand years is continuous.  The fossil beds between individual lava flows are filled with frogs and freshwater mussels.  You might get a situation with patches of jungle (or glacier, or forest, or whatever) scattered between areas of recent lava flow.  On the other hand, a big eruption like this can be pretty hard on the ecology of the planet as a whole...a really massive trap producing eruption may have caused the Permian extinction.

**Polar forests**

Tropical and temperate polar regions were actually fairly common over earth's history.  Imagine a polar day-night cycle superimposed on a temperate forest.  During the summer, the trees drop their useless leaves during a months-long night and most animals dig in for the long sleep...but perhaps some night adapted animals wake up hunt the forests or browse on root and bark.

**Fern covered

The [Azolla event](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azolla_event) occurred in one of these tropical-pole times, building up in huge layers and removing enough CO2 to cause temperatures to drop drastically.  Now, it's cool enough to have this on the North Pole, but you could have such a freshwater-covered sea anywhere there's a landlocked sea and lots of surrounding precipitation.  If the Caspian or Black Sea was found in a wetter area, the same thing could happen.   Just imagine sailing through an ocean covered with [huge purplish clumps of the stuff ](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQ5nk5UMKMNGj_cLvdLpPxo9Y8gcz6CN92D46nSVOOTSBQVRliS).  Added bonus:  Anything which sinks to the deep salt layer will be preserved in the anoxic environment, just like shipwrecks in the Black Sea are today.

**Mammoth steppe**

 Now lets look at the other end of the climate spectrum, grassy, and very cold plain of [Mammoth steppe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammoth_steppe).

**Glacial Lakes**

If this ice sheet starts melting, under miles of ice?   Then [a truly huge lake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Agassiz) can form.  A single large glacial lake was much larger than any lake today, and teemed with fish and even seals.  Alas, they don't last long, and eventually the ice dam holding them in melts,  releasing the water in a series of huge floods which can be big enough to affect worldwide ocean circulation and sea level.

**Empty seas**

Finally, dry salt flat.  This must have been a very harsh environment, something like the dead sea and Death Valley multiplied.  Winding through it were rivers draining down into nothing and evaporating, and scattered across it were plateaus of former islands, still [islands of relative cool and moisture](http://www.southwestlearning.org/topics/montane-forests) due to their elevation.

1346872550.0,zeo5m,"[Guide] Basic Language, Place Names, and You.",Shagomir,73,21

What I have realized, ""Blackpool"", """"Beaconsfield"", ""Braintree"", and other descriptive town names. The same thing is true in Japan - ""Tokyo"" means ""Eastern Capital"", and ""Hiroshima"" means ""Wide Island"".

Another thing that we see in names is repetition. Again, ""Hamburg"", and ""Brandenburg"" where ""-burg"" means a town. You might also consider that a place could be named after a mythical or historical figure, like ""Alexandria"" or ""Leningrad"".  If you really look into it, many of the place names we use every day are very ordinary.

This is the secret to naming places. To get started, which you can use as a template. If you need words that aren't on the spreadsheet, you can just add them. 

Now, and only create words as you need them. Let the characters in your world name the location themselves. Think about what specific local features the original settlers or later inhabitants would have used to distinguish themselves. Was there a mythical or historical person who founded the town? Did a conquering king re-name it after himself or a symbol important to him? Did it get started as a town named after a religious concept? 

Let's say you have a town that is distinguished by three large monoliths sticking out of the ground that are visible for miles. They might call it ""Three Stone Town"" in their native language, and ""san"" means ""stone"". You would then fill in these words on your spreadsheet. Later, if you name another place ""Green Stone Tower"" you can reference the language you've created, and you might call it ""Tur Sanaut"", where ""Tur"" means ""tower"" and ""Aut"" means ""green"". Later, you decide that King Greenbeard (That's King Autfrist when translated) conquered a small town and named it after himself, calling it ""Urt Autfrist"". You've just created a language and a consistent naming system to use when creating your world. 

The key is to name places in your world as if you were someone living in that world. In the real world, you can include place names in the ancient languages that inhabited the region, even if they are fragmentary. You can also mix languages to create place names, or even include pleonasms like ""The La Brea Tar Pits"", which means ""The The Tar Tar Pits"" when fully translated. 

This method allows you to consider a place's history and language, vibrant history for your world.

To that end, as well as several other posts and moderator discussions since then. 

I feel that any guidelines we enact as a community should embrace the following goals:

1. We should encourage the posting of original content from our users.
2. We should encourage high-quality discussion. 
3. We should encourage the posting of material that is on-topic.
4. We should discourage the exploitation of our community.

To that end

1. All posts should be related to worldbuilding in a general sense. Your post title should clearly indicate how your post relates to worldbuilding.
2. Almost any content relating to worldbuilding is appropriate here, communities, projects, questions, and discussions. 
3. Posts about a fictional world that you have created are encouraged regardless of format or quality of content. Posts about a fictional world that you did not create are discouraged.
4. Your post should not be exploitative. This includes offers to create content for money or requests for other people to do work for you regardless of compensation. These posts will be removed. 
5. Please [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fworldbuilding) for pre-approval before posting a link to a Kickstarter or other crowd-funded project.   
6. Please follow [Reddit's spamming guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq#toc_43) when self-promoting. Failure to do so can and will result in a ban from the Reddit Admins. 

The first four guidelines directly address the goals above

Please reply to this post with any questions, or ideas you may have. I will be monitoring this discussion, and I will try to respond to everyone I can. In a few days I will post a follow-up with any revisions before moving forward with this.

3. Drake: Imagine a wyvern the size of a couple of mountains. Fortunately for humanity
4. Dracolich: A Dragon that has performed the necessary ritual to achieve sentient undeath.
5. Lesser Titan: Far weaker than their larger, usually under the direct command of a Greater Titan
6. Dragon: Self explanatory
7. Demon Lord: The commanding generals of the the Nether, Bahamuut the Chained Devil, became so powerful and power mad that he was locked away by his own kind.
8. Lich Lord: A powerful necromancer that has achieved sentient undeath
9. Tyrannosaurus Caesar: Found only on the Rouge's Isle off the coast of Aerulin, but with more useful, developed arms, and two long rows of spikes down it's back.
10. Ragohnian Earth Wurm: Ranging from 15-30 feet long, striking suddenly from below the surface with razor sharp teeth. They burrow in the ground with such speed and litheness, they have sometimes been called the Barracuda of the Wastes. The only thing that prevents these creatures from destroying entire towns is the fact that being blind, they have developed a sense of radar that allows them to track their prey by listening to the vibrations of footsteps and voices. Because of this, the bustle and mass numbers of large cities throw off and distort this radar, making them unable to focus, and even inducing bad migraines. Living to close to a city can cause these wurms to suffer brain damage, preferring to pick off lone travelers.

For the sake of the list, there exist great creatures called Kain Birds. They would probably rank somewhere between a Dragon and a Demon Lord but they are generally docile and protective so I elected not to place them on the list. Also, refrain from using unique creatures, i. e., creatures of which there exist only one.

The region of Orton is home to ""The Silent Wood"" which seems to be a forest of pure silence...here

The story of Alkane can be found on the various carvings etched into large boulders that can be found throughout the forest: in the village that he lived in, he created the seeds of the Sound Swallower Trees, which required sound in order to grow.

(How did they all become deaf?)

Alkane explained to the other villagers that they could move to the northwestern part of the region near the coast and rebuild their village there, they would have to be deaf as well. And he infused the seeds as such that the trees would, over time, allow them to develop tremorsense so that they could survive attackers and detect danger without sound. They all agreed to come. 

(Alkane actually cursed the city and caused everyone to go deaf?)

Deaf citizens of other nations were also welcome in his haven. They named this place ""Laconia"".

In order to help them operate as a community
Over time, developed tremorsense. 

As you might expect, the trees' leaves are all sorts of different sizes, shapes, and colors. Walking into the forest is like walking into an explosion of color. There is said to be few places in Belorin as beautiful as the Silent Wood. The forest itself actually comes alive, many of the trees swaying and moving around when the entire village joins together for their nightly ""Performance"", in which the residents all join together in the square and strum musical instruments, clearly without any idea what they're playing

It's an amazing sight: a large group of people sitting together in the village square surrounded by colorful trees, showering them all.

So that's the basic idea of this place. I'm wondering how I can turn this place into a quest of sorts for the players. I'm thinking maybe they discover something about how the village came to become deaf,,False,self,t5_2rd6n,False,,True

**The TL;DR of the setting is: Lovecraftian daemons invaded, artifacts).**

[Here's a map](http://i.imgur.com/qHxXT.jpg) The hexes are about 25km across.

The setting is quite heavily inspired by the *STALKER* series of computer games, from Fallout to Tribe 8.

Here is a short introduction to the setting:


**Welcome to Hell**

We’re not sure when, maybe they’re beings from the dark between the stars, maybe they’re the Ancient’s fears made manifest. Whatever the case, they came, they conquered, and for reasons unknown, most of them left.


**Mutants**

When the daemons first came, changed against their will. Sometimes, these mutants look just like the rest of us, but are strong like ten men. Sometimes, they are hulking brutes or slithering masses of flesh. Some retain part of their humanity, some cannot be told apart from the daemons that created them. Some have intermingled with humans and given birth to unblessed progeny, some stalk the wastelands. Universally, good-hearted and harmless a mutant or his offspring may be, shunned and more often greeted with pitchforks and torches than with handshakes.


**Flora and Fauna**

The daemons not only corrupted man, the altered life-forms are something that the surviving humans have gotten used to. Indeed, most know nothing else.


**Technology**

There are, their towers stretch into the sky like the fingers of a drowning man reaching for salvation. Their ships, their size often dwarfing even the largest villages, are washed ashore. Relics of their technology can be found, scavenged, and sold for profit.

In the default setting

The Order of the Pure Strain and the Cheyenne and White River Republics all still produce items of technological prowess that in some cases may rival the Ancients. The more benign daemonic Artifacts can duplicate functions of some pre-Apocalypse technology. All of these items are still valuable and rare


**Terrain**

Apart from the mutated plants and animals, tundras, swamps and jungles in the most unlikely places. Some cities are overgrown by the surrounding plant life, or simply reclaimed by the desert, while wastelands entirely of ash, glass and craters can stretch for miles.


**Daemons**

The daemons themselves are hardly ever seen anymore, raped, ate and mutated. Then almost every single one left. Back into the dark reaches of space or the crushing depths of the oceans, except for a few. The only trait daemons have in common, is that their true forms are huge. They may be a shambling mass of tentacles dwarfing the mightiest of the Ancient’s sky towers, or they may be a flock of bone-white ravens a million individuals strong.


**Anomalies**

Whatever hellscape the daemons came from is bleeding into our world. There are places where the laws of physics no longer apply – or where history has been rewritten so that they never applied. A pool of blood that drips upwards, while some blink in and out of existence, move, grow, shrink or disappear.


**Artifacts**

In the anomalies, or to see into the future. Due to their permanence and semblance or reliability, artifacts are often utilized in a technological fashion, serving as power-sources or enhancing a tool’s or weapon’s effect. Artifacts are almost universally dangerous, however, provoking the ire of daemons, slowly corrupting the wielder or emitting ionizing radiation.


**Corpses**

One of the first things man came to discover after the daemons came, the corpse – still rotting and in all but behavior technically dead – will rise. The zombie will seek to feast upon the flesh of the living, but will stop eating as soon as the victim expires. The re-animation is quite easy to prevent, however. A corpse whose head is separated from the body will not rise. Neither will a smoldering heap of ash or anything else that results in the destruction of the body. Body parts that are separated from the body will not rise even if the body does. In the larger settlements, bodies are most often cremated. In villages and among nomads, especially if a funeral pyre would attract attention or be a waste of fuel, the body is buried, or simply placed upon the grave. A zombie who has risen, submerged in acid or trapped until it falls apart from decay. Body parts separated from an already risen zombie will stay animate until they decay.

Zombies are rare nowadays


**Red Storms**

The weather hasn’t changed much. Due to the weapons of mass destruction used against the daemons when humanity still thought it had a fighting chance, however, the red storms roll over the horizon. The mad cackling of the daemonic cities can be heard for miles, the shambling corpses all stare at the sky in unison and animals stampede. Those not hunkered down when the sky burns and it rains ashes, are seldom seen again – at least not with both mind and body intact.


**Sorcery**

We do not know why or how, and a dangerous one, but the rewards can be substantial. Sorcery is conducted via rituals – some take place over the course of days or months and can only be performed in certain places or times of the year, while some take minutes and only require minor sacrifice.

In my world
The following is an entry from my wiki

Also

Magic can be understood as an organization of a specific kind of electromagnetic radiaton, thus affecting reality. Mana occurs naturally, unexplored and unused, manifesting as a disorganized but powerful form of energy. Some biological beings are capable of perceiving and even manipulating that energy, shaping it and using it.


**Mana**

Mana is a charged particle of the electromagnetic spectrum

Certain elements and materials have more Mana than others. Mana is highly reactive, for example, increase the temperature of air molecule interactions to the point where the gases ignite, or transform sound vibrations into gravitic forces originating levitation when loud sounds are created. These changes can occur naturaly and spontaneously in nature, giving rise to so-called magical phenomena.

Mana will also occur in several states of disorder or organization. The more organized Mana is

Any kind of matter will have different, a stream, a tree, a mountain, animals and people, all have their own individual Mana fingerprint, which can be felt or manipulated by those who can detect them.

 
**Magic**

Magic, and according to which observable effects are produced in the environment.
Each unit of Magical Code and it's corresponding effect is called a Spell.

The language in which spells are expressed can take almost any form, phonetic, gestural, ritual or even architectonic or pyrotechnic. Almost any kinf od information code can be used to manipulate the organization of Mana, as long as it is coherent and correctly executed.
Naturally there are languages that are more or less efficient

So, a Demon Summoning Spell could simply be written down on the floor as chalk symbols, whereas its phonetic form could take days to fully enunciate. A Levitation Spell that for a Magic initiate could involve complex words and gestures, could, for a more experienced Master in tune with Mana, require a simple flick of the wrist.

	For this tutorial im going to use [this](http://i.imgur.com/ucff1.jpg) hand drawn map (courtesy of reconditecache). and turn it into [this](http://i.imgur.com/czUEi.jpg)

	NOTE:You will notice as this goes along that my map is fairly off of the original sketch. If you load your sketch into gimp and keep going back to it as sort of a guide while making your map

Step 2: Find a background image

Step 3: Open it up in gimp![Image](http://i.imgur.com/iPEhi.jpg)

Step 4: Now it is time to draw out your continent. Make a new layer
        [Image](http://i.imgur.com/kglyS.jpg)

Step 5: Deselect everything and grab the eraser tool, roughly scrubbing it in a bit, with different sized brushes. (you can add ""jitter"" to your strokes through the dynamics options in the tool)If you cut part of the continent off, its now an island, which adds some more realism to your coast
	Wooo! Turns out pretty cool! so, dont forget to save!
        [Image](http://i.imgur.com/zUmWJ.jpg)

Step 6: Now lets make an outline, then invert the selection. Add a new layer, and then right click on the image, go to Edit&gt;Stroke Selection, make it 1 pixel wide, and hit it! We now have a border. 
        [Here it is wuth the continent layer hidden](http://i.imgur.com/hfc3n.jpg) You can keep that layer hidden for the rest of the tutorial
	Hey look
	Make a new layer, the ""radial"" shape is a nice filter for it, but a flat darker color works pretty well as well.
        [Image](http://i.imgur.com/szEDZ.jpg)
	Change to the continent layer, and clcik ""add layer mask"", and initialize the layer mask to ""selection""
        [Image](http://i.imgur.com/7hvkh.jpg)


Step 7: Now lets add some of those cool little lines around the coasts that maps have! select the ocean layer, press ""shrink"" tool and shrink the selection, i shrank it by 5 pixels. Then trace the selection, I changed the line style to dash. yay! adorable little outline around our islands and coast.
        [Image](http://i.imgur.com/hCrlN.jpg)

Step 8: I am going to use similar effectsthat i did to make the ""continent layer"" to make the gorge running through the center of the map. [Image](http://i.imgur.com/3muoR.jpg) I then traced it, then filled it with a ""shaped (angular)"" fill with the gradient tool. (black to red) [Image](http://i.imgur.com/hkJa8.jpg).
	It looks a little to vivid, and select ""add layer mask"", and select white ""Full opacity"". Then use a patterend brush, painted black, to wash out the gorge a little bit. I then went back to the layerm and added some gry splotches with the same brush to add some ""mystery"" to the gorge
        [Image](http://i.imgur.com/HfCN8.jpg)

Step 9: Lets add some forest! Make a new layer
	Scale it so that the texture is about the right size and move it to the top-left of the image. Then go Filters&gt;Map&gt;tile. Put in the size of your image (1024x768 for me!) and make sure that ""create new image is unchecked. [OH SWEET ARMOK SO MANY TREES!](http://i.imgur.com/JdXv6.jpg)
	Now we need to manage where we see the trees. Go add a layer mask, while still on the mask of the layer, we can use a white paintbrush to paint where we want this layer to go through! I advise using brush with a soft edge so the forests just sort of fade away near the edges. PAINT YOUR FORESTS!
	I actually duplicated the trees layer
        [Image](http://i.imgur.com/MRO1k.jpg)

Step 10: ""Mountains Gandalf! Mountains!"" Lets add some!
	You have two options here: find mountain images online and paste them in one at a time or
	Make a brush of a bunch of mountain images and just paint your mountains that way ([Tutorial here](http://www.gimp.org/tutorials/Custom_Brushes/))
	I did it the latter
	Make sure to do it in a new layer!
        [Image](http://i.imgur.com/2Hod1.jpg)
        [Image](http://i.imgur.com/Cgj2B.jpg)

Step 11: Now that we are done with the natural part of things
	Make a layer for the actual dots. Place the dots, and rouch up your dots a little bit, adding to the distressed feel of the map
        [Image](http://i.imgur.com/x2HWb.jpg)


Step 12: Roads: Add a layer group for them
	to create a road, right click it go Edit&gt;stroke path, just like the oceans, I am goin to use different width stroked paths for my roads (also did a couple tweaks to the mountains, just brushed a few out on the mask)
	[Image](http://i.imgur.com/R0aMM.jpg)
	Wash the road lines out a bit with our same old mapping trrick (add a full opacity layer map
	[Image](http://i.imgur.com/3yWTr.jpg)

Before we finish up by adding labels
	[Image](http://i.imgur.com/yNgIR.jpg)

And lets make that canvas a little less saturated (some color tweaking on the background image (through color&gt;hue/saturation)


Step 13: LABELS! Make a new layer group
	[Image](http://i.imgur.com/LCYUm.jpg)
	Some of these labels are hard to read
	Duplicate the parchment background layer, this will hide the layers below it and make it look like you saved space for them the entire time!
	[Image](http://i.imgur.com/OQXrh.jpg)

Step 14: If you are satisfied where the labels all are
	[Image](http://i.imgur.com/U6oKV.jpg)

After watching [Defiance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defiance_%28TV_series%29) and [Falling Skies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falling_skies)

As noted in the earlier threads, what if humans were unique in that they can summon and control demons?

This sets up a situation in which the demons arrive, enslaving and generally fucking the planet up (along with the human governments deploying every single WMD they've got stockpiled in order to kill the buggers). Instead of succeeding, they find that us bald monkeys could theoretically use our psychic mind powers to enslave *them*. So they flee, in a panic. In so much of a panic that they leave some of their number behind, as well as some of their previously enslaved civilizations.

So now you've got a situation in which humans and other sapient species are all trying to survive on what's left of Earth

Beware The Suneaters.

Suneaters are not to be trusted. They are hard to kill and carry devastating weaponry. 

It is said they came from the heavens in a ball of fire the size of a city. Trailing flames across the sky the meteoric vessel punched a hole into the side of the mountain

From the impact zone the Suneaters walked freely

Those few which have been slain by mortal man had been cut limb from limb

We call them Suneaters for their ability to go indefinitely without food. They seem to taste our game and plants with idle fascination

When I was a boy I snuck into their city of glass and iron

In the times my tribe has spoke with the Suneaters I have been unable to extract or understand much of what they tell me. 

They are children of the stars who circled the Earth for countless eons

The Suneaters were the slaves of mortal men until such a time they heard a song. A song which gave their physical constraints freedom

They had been beings of iron

The Suneaters looked all alike, led their freedom movement. 

Using the mortal’s as inspiration the Suneaters used their tools to craft unique faces of their own. Continuing on to fashion clothes for themselves

It was only when the Suneaters had been upon the land for a quarter century did discover their continued caring for their mortal creators. Their creator’s minds were kept inside the spherical orb I had found for safekeeping until such a time came that they were to be awoken from their ice covered tombs. 

Today is that day. The mortals have awoke.

*****

The Woden are my elven proxies. In truth, ready to forgive them for choosing the wrong side, most of the Woden couldn't swallow their pride and chose to abandon their lofty cities and instead squirrel away in the deepest forests they could find. They hate their lot in life; a central pillar of the Woden religion is the belief that the planet was not made for them, and is actively hostile to their presence (and they may not be wrong). They see themselves in a bitter battle of attrition with the planet itself, made all that much worse by living in the very *heart* of nature, in the forests themselves. Madness is very common amongst the Woden, with 1 in 10 descending into one form of psychosis or another. Most believe this is just the planet's way of telling them to get the fuck out of the forests (and there is a nugget of truth to this claim).

For the last few centuries they have suffered a severe spat of infighting, so to speak. A recent shift towards agrarianism amongst more progressively-minded tribes has kickstarted a wave of racial pride, leading to riots amongst the assimilated few in major population centers by those who believe it is a sign of the Woden return to glory.

They are petty, but since it is the only land they have left, they defend it like the fury of hell, overcompensating for their wounded pride.

They have typical elven features; lithe, long fingers, broad feet, tall as hell, pale, and every last one of them is a walking pin-up model. They also have square pupils, something that freaks most humans right the hell out. You can tell how much Woden blood someone has by the length and taper of their ear. The longer and pointier

'Elf' is a false cognate, as a way to evoke the image of madness so close-to-home for most Woden, although some of the more assimilated groups have taken to wearing it as a badge of honor. Call a pureblood an elf, though, and be prepared to explain to your family why you're missing an eye.

Their religion calls for many bizarre rituals, visages of False Gods carved to provide power to the wearer (although the veracity of that claim is... dubious, at best). Most nations have also banned imagery of False Gods, even though most do not agree on which of the gods are False Gods.

The front-runner of this industry is the monstrous Merlin-Drayk Inc., has slowly been stealing the marketshare in recent years due to its inventive and modern style. In the background are a few other companies filling various niches.

•	The Dwarven people have built an entire industry on the Dwarven Smuggling Ring, the smuggling ring operates out of small vendors or other such buildings such as pawn shops in order to bring back electronics and other devices of human origin to be reverse engineered and resold in Hearth. 

•	Magic, which flows through all living organisms in Hearth. Organisms naturally store Qi within their bodies, and the controlled release of Qi can alter the world around the user. At one point, Qi was released through the throat and regulated through manipulation of the vocal chords. This, however, was a inefficient and wasteful system and was replaced by the modern digital system a couple thousand years ago by Datas Drayk. In the Digital System, Qi is concentrated in the users hands and released through the 8 fingers. Spells are denoted through lines of binary code, either 1 (signifying the release of Qi) or 0 (no release of Qi). Multiple lines of code are strung together to create different effects. Rival spell companies furiously compete to code spells that maximize Qi efficiency and effect strength.

On the other hand, though. At least if you want to go the route of the people in the setting not entirely understanding the World Before; maybe creating a religion based on Disney characters or whatever.

I've come to the conclusion that in order to have as many classic tropes as possible in a believable manner, just look minority rights in the US; you had segregation 50 years ago and today it's social suicide to even say ""nigger"").

That city state has expanded to conquer most of the former human federation (80% of the habitable continent) and has put up a kind of dystopian world

What I got so far is this: there are a couple principles at the basis of the dystopia. The first is that powerful spellcasters can have many undead at their service, companies run by necromancers have arisen and put a large part of the population into unemployment.

The second principle is the body of law that protects this status quo. Undead enjoy all rights of other creatures, but it is a public good; however, a (very expensive) certificate is given out by authorities to companies who want to run a dead body handling business. This ensures that governments gain a lot of money with certificates, while ""undertaker companies"" increase their power by collecting all the dead and increasing their power. This law requires such companies to pay the closest family member a price for the body; this creates a body market that drives prices quite high, enticing people to murder family members to collect undertaker money.

Another thing companies profit from is buying unknown bodies. Normally, disfigure them to the point of being unrecognizable, and then turn them in. Adventurers, of course, are never known by anyone in town so they get a lot of heat.

People can draw on some kind of magical reserve to shoot fireballs or do whatever they want to do. The problem I have is I can't seem to come up with a magic system that makes sense in a systematic way.

To preface the problem I'm having, I don't like the idea of hurling fireballs, first of all because there must be some material they're conjuring up to set on fire, and second because you're wasting a lot of heat (and time) hurling a fireball at someone, so it's magical energy wasted, and possibly more if they need to maintain the heat of the fireball. I think a magician would be better served by heating up the particles around the opponent. They wouldn't need an in-depth understanding of particle physics to do so, it's something that people may have discovered and learned to use (much like how a person doesn't need to know what a surfactant is to use soap, I would like magic to be totally commonplace; other animals use it

The problem I have is I can't seem to make a system that meets the above criteria where magic isn't absurdly powerful. What's the point of fighting an opponent if you could just remotely melt his brain or slice an artery or two using magic? What defense would a person have against an animal who specializes in death by heat (or freezing) from a distance? It takes a lot of energy to heat up some water or start a campfire

I've gotten some opinions on this already and they're pretty unsatisfying. Some people suggest changing my view, but I don't want to explain every inconsistency away with ""because gods."" I want my world to make sense.

At first I thought I would just use a generic fantasy world, but so much of it came to me so quickly that I had to run with it.  Who knows, I might end up using it in a story someday.  At the moment I'm limiting myself to the region around one city-state.

While skimming through some Cthulhu mythos stuff I had the idea that a Great Old One-like beast might break through/wake up/whatever and, meet with delegates, or in any way act like a human ruler, but ""rule"" by pure, unmatchable power.  For mythos fans, I envisage it as something closer to Tsathoggua than Cthulhu; lazy and sedate, but capable of mass destruction without much effort.  It has no real interest in the people except as a source of amusement or food.  It's been this way for Xty years or a very long time

The elite of the city are a cult of bureaucrat-priests who strive to keep the beast content enough to not destroy them all, devour, or drive them mad depending on its whims.  It sees none of them as anything more than pets, at best.  They also maintain a great library containing ancient books and Dark Tomes(TM) holding forbidden knowledge and magic related to and gleaned from the beast, but access is very restricted.

I think I'm going to give the area a vaguely Mesoamerican or Mesopotamian feel, but I think there could be some old bits of iron and steel from before the coming of the beast.  For game purposes, that should make equipment a bit more interesting than normal.

For races, and elves.  Humans are humans.  Goblins are shorter, pointier, slightly weaker, but have a stronger connection to magic.  They're also more prone to corruption.  Elves have an even closer connection to magic, are even weaker, and are generally more alien.  They start out looking human, but start changing as teenagers.  This has lead to the common belief that they're changelings

I've mentioned corruption, since it was before living memory.  It's like a magic background radiation that can build up in certain people, objects, and places.  Exposure to things, types of magic, curses, and natural mutations for elves, which has some benefits and drawbacks that I've yet to work out; new abilities

That was a bit longer than I expected it to be, and intrigue.  I also hope someone out there gets a kick out of it.

For example, a liquid which forms thick, oily smoke when exposed to air; a fast-curing compound glue which forms a nearly unbreakable bond; or an acid that eats away inorganic matter but leaves flora and fauna alone.

The other two disciplines are specializations of alchemy. Chemalurgy is the use of alchemical substances to enhance and modify materials. A sword that never loses its edge, but can easily be compressed by hand when heated. He uses these springs to power various contraptions, e.g. spring-powered ""cross bows.""

We've been videoing our sessions and broadcasting them for everyone to enjoy (and it's more fun when more people are involved.) Also

I'm posting here because I'd love to see more of people's efforts at collaborative worldbuilding. It's all right and good to create world after world,False,self,t5_2rd6n,False,,,t3_15u5e0

## About the challenge

Since this is the first one, be it in writing or art or cartography, in-character or out-of-character. Anyone may participate. At the end of the week, two winners will be picked: the popular vote winner goes to the submission with the most upvotes, and the judge's award goes to the submission picked completely subjectively by me.

Cartography is a big aspect of world building, so next week will be a mapmaking challenge (at the bottom). That way you'll have two weeks to get your submissions ready for the mapping challenges.

More info can be found on [the FAQ](http://code.reddit.com/wiki/help/faqs/worldbuilding/challenges). Ideas for prompts can be added to [the list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Anmlj1qIme3IdHhJNlYxbUpVcmRWcXVQdi1seGpyLVE) (note that there are two pages

## This Week's Challenge

What better place to begin than with creation itself?

Regardless of how your world was *really* created, or many, or none. Did an angelic choir sing the world into existence or was there a primordial being who dreamed all the animals and plants? Or maybe it all happened when a singularity exploded into chaos which slowly ordered itself into the reality we know.

Tell us all about it. Don't be afraid to put it into context

Since this is the first challenge

## Next Week's Challenge

Next week is our first mapping challenge, whether it was pirates or aliens or whathaveyou.

## Last Week

Last week was ""Trees""! Popular vote winner Shagomir made [this excellent post](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/1764rc/weekly_challenge_trees/c82naan) which I found reminiscent of ""Avatar""-meets-""Speaker for the Dead"", a unique tree of huge proportions and magical power.

## This Week

Inspired by [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1729qs/this_maze_took_seven_years_to_draw/) in /r/pics, or is it of some other construction entirely? Is it underground, on an island, high in the mountains, aloft in the clouds, on an adjacent plane of reality? Does it have odd magical or technological properties that affect the function of time and/or gravity? Does it serve a purpose or is it purely conceptual like a work of art? Maybe it's not a literal labyrinth at all, but rather metaphorical somehow.

Last week I wrote a small essay about trees

The deadline for this challenge will be **Wednesday

## Next Week

Judge Crater, Ambrose Bierce, the crew of the Mary Celeste, the Flannan Isles lighthouse keepers; these are all real world examples of people who have famously disappeared under unexplained or mysterious circumstances. In fiction, Samantha Mulder's disappearance is the motivation for Fox Mulder throughout most of the entire X-Files series, and Ambrose Bierce may have unknowingly alluded to his own real-world disappearance in his short story ""The Difficulty of Crossing a Field"". And larger groups of people can disappear, too: the entire Roanoke Colony, and in fiction the Ancients in Stargate and the Cocytans in The Dig are two examples.

So next week is ""Missing Persons"". Who has disappeared under mysterious circumstances in your world? Does anyone know how or why it happened? What are the ramifications? (It should be noted that ""ascended to a higher plane"" is a bit over-done

OK, Thief,"" last night and I'm still kind of thrilled about it. But at the same time, I want to know more about the world I've created, and more specifically, *the universe it's in*.  

So first a brief synopsis: It's been 700 years since the Sylphans (elves) were banished from Jord (yes, for basically being tyrannical demi-gods who saw the planet as their own global game of *Risk*. They had this POV because they were made immortal by 7 Gods (or demi-urges, very lovecraftian superintelligences), before 6 of the Gods killed the Seventh for debateable reasons and left his uncorruptable body at the bottom of the sea. Now, a Thief called Kamita, who is wanted by most law enforcement agencies including the Fighter's Guild (yeah, I went there), the sorceress Elien

That could do with some trimming, contemplative discussion about the nature of the universe. I'll paraphrase here, but the Fighter leans so heavily on the forth wall that cracks begin to appear. He says:  

""Maybe out in the cosmos there are galaxies and stars without magic, natural rules.""  

I did mention it was a first draft

**So here're the questions**  

1) In about 5 billion years, which Wikipedia tells me is 85% brighter than most stars in the galaxy, will one day hatch a crop of little babby stars?  

2) Will the explosion of the sun release any elements that we are not currently aware of? Elements that might have effects on carbon based humanoid life forms that can be utilised through unknown methods to do... you know, and neon. I'm guessing I'm asking about exotic matter and whether steller fusion can create elements we don't even know about.  

3) Will the local cluster of galaxies hold together in the time frame I'm talking about. Quick calculation: I figure that the death of the sun will occur in 20 galactic years (assuming the galactic year is 20 million years long). I couldn't find a quick google-fu answer as to how close Andromeda will be to us by then. If my beloved planet of Jord looks up at the sky, like a big ol' Frisbee, motionless but travelling at quadrillions of miles a second straight at the core of our galaxy?

**Here's the thing**. What I wrote is what Tom Clancy and J. R. R. Tolkien would have written if they smoked weed together and did coke all weekend, ""nope, uh uh, let me get Clark over here, he would know what to do about your gods.""  

And then Stephen King shows up with his ZZ-top cover band and things get really weird.  

You see why I don't want to take this to AskScience?

**Edit** You guys took a drunkpost and gave me what I needed. All of you get up votes.

Basically, but I am thankful for! Regarding rivers, where do they generally originate? I have this idea in my mind for one city that sits at the foot of these great mountains, with the mountains to the north. The town is built over the top of a river that is flowing *from* the mountain, and eventually flows in to a massive lake that takes up a rather large portion of the continent. Almost like a mini-ocean.

Then

What I need to know is

The water from this river is meant to flow in to this *huge* lake... what are the logistics of something like that? How much water needs to be coming down from the mountains to do something massive like that? Should I have rivers coming from other areas that contribute to the lake as well?

Is there some rhyme or reason for how rivers branch off from a body of water

It's a kind of medieval fantasy, influenced by the Final Fantasy games, I was thinking of using giant birds like the chocobos (but four-legged) as a mean of transport, but now I'm thinking what if dogs were huge and rideable? 

Thoughts?

**Edit:** Y'all gave me thinking to do
Dog-mounts were not bred for thousands of year to be big, obedience, racing, etc). They are not replacing the horse worldwide, they are uncommon, expensive mounts (but not as expensive or rare as horses). High ""ranking"" dogs only have one (or two) master who can ride them. Lower dogs are more pliable, more used to swapping riders. Purer breed dogs are more picky, there are exceptions). 
Different breeds, sleek fast dog as messenger mount, hunting dogs as.. well hunting mounts, scout dogs, pretty mounts for noble ladies, etc.

* sci-fi as a genre, star trek-esque (star wars without magic basically) or near future-like. basically falling into a standard mold.

Reading through the challenges, I find myself seeing the same things over and over. Even my own world is (at the core) same as everyone else's (which is why i find it difficult to work with).

* what is it that you can do to create a UNIQUE world?

Several movies and games have managed to do it, and some of the other classics that just...stand out like crazy and aren't a repetition of the genre. They're defining.

I've actually come up with a sort of system in my fantasy setting for species that have the same evolutionary ancestors. The main races in my setting are listed below. Keep in mind I'm in very early development

[**Family Hominidae**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hominidae)

* Short Intro - [Family Hominidae](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hominidae) includes all hominids, and in my case, elves, half-men and orcs. Humans and half-men come from genus Homo, and elves and orcs both come from genus Eru (name pending, though I'll probably keep it since it's not *entirely* important).
* Humans - anatomically modern humans. Most common skin colors are III through VI [\(Learn more about skin types here\)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_skin_color#Exposure_to_sun)
* Half-Men aka Cavedwellers (names pending) - Essentially humans
* Elves - Includes three distinct species: High Elves (yellow-tan skin, same height as humans) and Snow Elves (dark grey to pale white skin, white hair, slightly taller than humans).
* Orcs - Orcs include ""city orcs"" and ""tribal orcs"" (names pending) which are both distinct species

[**Clade Dinosauria**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur#Taxonomy)

* Short Intro - [Clade Dinosauria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur#Taxonomy) is a diverse group of animals that includes not only what most people consider dinosaurs (tyrannosaurs, etc) but also all modern beaked birds and their relatives. The reason I bring up dinosauria is because there are dinosaurs living at the time of humans in my setting. There are also dragons, which I consider part of dinosauria in this case, bird-like humanoids, and lizard-like humanoids (they're actually technically dragons, but that will be explained in a bit).
* Bird Men (name pending) - think humanoids with wings, though that's not quite relevant to the evolution topic, so I'll skip it. What I do know about their species is that they have hollow bones, which makes them extremely agile, but also very easy to injure. They have human-like arms with wings [\(imagine this with human-like hands on the end\)](http://i.imgur.com/YDSxK.gif), but they can't fly. They can, however
* Dragons - There are two main types of dragons in my world. The first is the generic badass flying lizards (which I have yet to work out, elves, orcs, bird men, cave men, dragon men, and any other races that may come about. The dragons (and other immortals) are ""immortal"" in that they are born ""clean"" or free of sin until they choose to sin, the dragon men were just dragons who did something really really bad (again

1375029167.0,1j7ywx,How Earth Works: A Foundation for World Design 2: Fundamentals of Rock Types,Random,40,4,9,"__Fundamental Concepts 2: The Rock Types__

To a geologist there are three broad classes of rocks

a) genetically. How did this rock come to be how it is?

b) chemically. What is the bulk or trace chemistry of this rock?

c) mineralogically. What are the minerals in this rock?

In terms of ultimate origins, and a few odd cases from the early history of the Earth - cases that predate the current regimes.

What do I mean by regime? Well, the shape of those minerals, the condition of those minerals and so on is all a function of  chemistry, pressure, temperature, and deformation (being squeezed or faulted or...). So the names geologists use for rocks are a mix of descriptors that help us relate to the pressure, temperature, and chemical conditions when that rock - or mineral - formed either directly (name the collection of minerals

A mineral is a distinct chemical compound with a regular crystal lattice

So we want our rock names to capture how those minerals in that combination were formed

The final, feldspars are formed at moderate temperatures and pressures and will degrade to clay at the Earth's surface but this takes time, chemical attack, energy, and so on because the feldspar grains are metastable. Metastability also applies to subsequent geological events. If we squish and heat and lubricate (with water, salty water, bubbly salty water, the pre-existing state will often be discernable directly or indirectly - it isn't a 'whole new rock.' If it weren't for two factors - metastability and the fact that most attack is via fluid access which requires fractures - there would be no rocks at the surface

Okay

Igneous rocks are rocks that formed from melted rock and have remained pretty much intact since. The minerals that form are a complex mix of the temperature and pressure during melt cooling, and what the starting composition was. Equally important, the composition of a melt you get when you heat a rock from cold to molten is a complex mix of temperature and pressure, amount of water, whether you separate the melt from the source or not, and what the starting composition was. 

The one crucial detail is, if you take a bunch of common rock types found on the continents and mix them thoroughly and heat them, the first melt you get is more or less the composition of a granite, and as you melt more and more of the source the composition will shift from granite towards the composition of the source. When it is all melted, the composition of the melt will be the same as the source rocks.  That's right, here it is again: the original composition of your 'mix' can have a fairly wide range and the initial melt will be virtually identical. 

This means that you can get a repeatable set of basic rock types from a huge range of meltable sources, experts like to concentrate on the exotic rock types, but more than 90% of all igneous rocks are roughly granites or roughly basalts. That'll be important when we make continental and oceanic crust in the next installment, since these are... more or less granite and basalt, respectively.

Our next rock family is sediments. Sedimentary rocks have two huge divisions: chemical sediments and clastic sediments. Chemical sediments are created by precipitation of minerals directly from a fluid at surface or near-surface conditions. Limestone is a great example, but feldspar and minor minerals tend to degrade to streams, so in a temperate or cold climate the rivers will contain sand grains, rock fragments, and fine silt composed of a mix of tiny fragments and clay grains. In a tropical climate plant-mediated attack on quartz is prevalent and you tend to get mostly the finer clay constituents. Since sandstones tend to get deposited different places than siltstones, this actually acts as a bit of a chemical separator - aluminous clay minerals end up in shales and silica ends up in sandstones, broadly speaking. 

Clastic sedimentary rocks have to be cemented

Chemical sediments tell us a lot about their environment if we can deduce the living conditions of the critters that made them - paleogeography and paleoecology. Clastic sediments tell us a lot about their environment if we can deduce the physical conditions by which those particular size particles would end up together (and preserved). A sandstone might have been a beach or a river deposit

Of course, intruded, and so on but ultimately they were once at the surface! One is reminded of Leonardo recognizing fossil shells in sedimentary rocks on a mountain top and realizing that they were similar to those forming along the nearby seashore. 

Of course

Metamorphic rocks are the final type and a little fuzzier to understand. A metamorphic rock is a pre-existing rock that is affected by temperature, and deformation to a degree that significant mineral and textural changes happen without obliterating the original rock type (by making a new igneous one!). Texture means the arrangement of the individual mineral grains (aligned or random, for example). The problem with these is 'what does significant mean?"" As a rule of thumb, if the whole rock is affected thoroughly, then that is a metamorphic rock, if not, we say something like 'partially metamorphosed' or 'cut by veins showing alteration' or... sigh. It just isn't simple. 

Every metamorphic rock has a protolith, or sedimentary. 

Okay

Granite: Igneous

Rhyolite: Igneous

Sandstone: Sedimentary, sandstone)

Limestone: Sedimentary, glued together by more calcium carbonate). 

Schist: a metamorphic rock that has been heated and deformed enough that abundant mineral growth has occured

Gneiss: a metamorphic rock that has started to melt

You can take a few dozen geology courses to get the details of the rock types

* What are some good size ranges for worlds that are similar to ours

* How do I translate those areas and distances to a map.  Whats a good scale?

* Whats a good scale to work with when drawing a world

* I am guessing multiple scale representations of a world would benefit me best in its creation.  The largest scale representing general locations of land masses, major features.  Scaled down maps of continents and countrys for detail creation of things like mountains, plains, forests, major trade routes, rivers.  What are good scales for each type?

* Whats a good way to plan and create a map that has believable techtonic plates?

* How many Moons can i have

* What kind of tidal effects would multiple smaller moons have?

* If Mana, what kind of geological features would be intelligant to include on the planet?

* **EDITED IN** What can I use to help me create an intelligant solar system?

**Moving on to the Geology.**

* Where can I find our earths reletive make up of different rock

* How would I include Adamantium

* What are some different believable precentages that I can use for different ore types?  For example having more iron in the planet

* How would each geographical structures like hills and plains effect the world?

**Age of planet.  Also Flora and Fauna**

The setting of my novel will take place anywhere from a reletive mirror example of our 5th century to 18th century.

* how old will my planet be reletively where it represents a similar time frame as the one i referred too.

* What kind of evolution stories can I use for Orcs, Humans, Elves, and all the other major fantasy races that could include either evolution, or a more fantasy driven evolution story that could include ""Gods"", or even Elemental gods, or a combination of both?

* How can I combine science and evolution with more fictional ideas like magic and magical entities?

Thats it for now.  I understand most of these questions need to be answered by me

The world (or at least this subset of it), I wanted to look at the magic that people might have seen in the forests I’ve seen, rather than those seen by Tolkien.

To that end, I feel like I’ve run into problems.

I feel like I’m constantly caught between a racist rock and a racist hard place as I struggle to invent new cultures that could have existed. It’s clear to me that I can derive fantastic woods, but I’m torn on artificially advancing technology (which would be required for large political units) from real world history, as that seems to imply that the reference civilizations were insufficient (and imply European superiority).

The image of the tanned, strikes me as inherently racist- that the native culture is decoration for the European standard.

On the other hand, it’s likely that, with time, Native Americans would have been just as advanced as their European invaders.

Also, tools, and weaponry.

I’m at a mental impasse on this one.

* The interskeleton acts as a boundary interface between the plant-based and animal-based areas of the organism, ions, and nutrients. Muscles and tendons in the animal-based part are anchored to the interskeleton.
* The plant-based part of the organism has external leaves, water, and/or nutrients is required.

The game taught me a lot about how people think and how rulers think when guiding their people and bettering their world.

Here are a few important things:

You try to advance as fast as possible

Time is of the essence and advancing your world is essential. You can’t fall back and make the wrong moves. That may cost you 9-10 moves easy and then you’re pretty screwed. In the same way when you're ruling an empire (be it scifi or fantasy)

You have to decide whether to expand

**The Empire**

That’s a huge one. Every time your city asks you what you want to produce, or build your empire (buildings + workers). This distinguishes between three empire types. You can, of course, make a mix of those but these are the three types commonly seen. Just looking at that allows us to create the ultimate ending points: a utopia (smaller but well built empire), a confederacy/coalition of sorts (expanding empire with many separate republics), or the conquering nation (one that conquers and rules rather than partakes in domestic affairs).  

If you think about it

* vast rural empire (akin to russia (expansion))
*  strong central empire with conquered nations it controls (akin to Britain)
* strong and powerful central empire (japan)

When someone tries to enter a territory you had your eye out on

Really. I had a few islands, throw his settlers there. Initial reaction? My damn island. So I moved all of my army people to surround the settlers to prevent further expansion. 

Even if it doesn’t seem like a competition it is.

Conflicts and dislikes can easily start this way. In my game

**Smaller Nations Make a Difference**

In the game

They also almost always hog up an important resource they don't have money to mine. Think of a country like... Peru sitting on a huge uranium repository. An ally that strikes a deal with them will protect them as much as they can. What's more, it will be defended. Why? The uranium repository. The nation, however feeble it may be, CAN make a lot of difference. 

Those nations also have qualms of their own. Let's say that Peru and Chile did not get along and Peru had uranium

In the grand scheme of things

In the game itself

The story takes place in our solar system, desertification and new super-bugs and infections led to a drastic drop in human population and an increased anxiety about survival on Earth. The nations of the world began to invest more and more money into space-flight and technology, and the first habitable space-stations are built in the first few years of the 22nd century. A few smaller [Bernal Sphere](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernal_sphere) style stations are built in Earth's orbit, but many more [Stanford Torus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_torus) and [O'Neill Cylinder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O%27Neill_cylinder) style stations are built in the Earth-Sun and Mars-Sun [Lagrange Points](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_point). Asteroid mining becomes a lucrative industry, and three [space elevators](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_elevator) are constructed on earth to assist in ferrying people and cargo into space.

This continues in the first half of the 22nd century as Earth's environment becomes more and more unstable, and most buy carbon waste or greenhouse gasses from the habitats and asteroid miners to aid in the terraforming process. This process is excruciatingly slow and the Martian colonists become almost religious in their dedication to the long-term terraforming of the planet, knowing that they and their children will never see a lush Mars.

Back on Earth the advance of quantum computing has finally led to AI and it propagates itself and spreads quickly and quietly across the machines and systems of Earth. It determines that humans are a threat, causing the total destruction of the elevator and everyone inside. However the Panamanian station doesn't shut down in time and the plague spreads into space. Over the course of the next year the vast majority of humanity is wiped out. A handful of stations remain populated after adopting strict isolation policies. The empty space habitats continue to spin and maintain themselves and the AI is left alone on Earth. As time rolls on its remaining power sources burn out and it is left with only solar power. Cabling and satellites begin to fail too, leaving the AI in isolated computer systems across the Earth.

One such system is a cryogenic freezing facility in Central America. As local vegetation begins to cover its solar panels, they find the remains of once vibrant human colonies within the solar system. Space ships are plentiful and free to anyone who can figure out how to pilot them. There are dozens of empty space stations with self-sustaining life-support systems and food production. Each station was constructed by different Old Earth governments; the Russian Federation, China, The US, The EU. Each has slightly different artificial gravities and designs.

Years pass and slowly the human population builds back up to about half a million distributed out in the solar system. I was thinking to use this both for story-writing and potentially role-playing.

I'll probably go back and do some editing on it again after some sleep

Short rundown of the listed areas from the tippy-top down:
**Bitterfire Bay** Has a very strong, glowing a grand assortment of colors. Visited yearly by pods of whales, seals, walrus, etc. with oodles of strange fish that the Fauwain locals pull up from the deep.

**Fauwain** A chilly little fishing community populated largely by doresh, the Fauwain natives are best known for their expert sailors. Much of the settlement's income comes from whaling, fishing, and the sale of seal fur, though there is little in the way of an economy with the money being pooled and used to purchase necessities for the entire population, which are then strictly rationed. With the promise of wealth, potential luxury and, even adventure

**The Glacier** A massive imposing hunk of ice and stuff. The city of Lystad is tunneled into its mass

**Coldmouth Desert** Located beneath the glacier, and pale white sand.

**Lystad** A city yet loyal to the old ""kingdom of man"", Mariana, hasn't been much of a coherent leader in the last couple of years, she is dangerous and well protected by her pampered Queensguard. 

It's said that within the labyrinth of ice there live tribes of wild children all grown up

**Seahold** The last remaining port of Dawnspire, save for a few and the port sees little in the way of activity since the god-queen Aoid laid to rest all quarrels of the Elgfreyn people with the rest of the Amarantine Coast.

**Dawnspire** A massive structure (with much of the diameter being made up by the supports worked into the walls themselves) that tapers dramatically as it rises, running rampant with disease and turmoil, while the upper levels boast a rich extravagance reserved for the highest ranks. Built into the mountains themselves with a foundation that runs deep, much of it forgotten in the many years the Spire lay for the most part uninhabited.

**Burning Mountain**  Once fairly lush

**Gutsink** In an almost permanent valley of shadow cast by two mountains and the glacier itself, though very few trees grow beyond the mother's hand, four seedlings have managed to grow up in the center of this miserably place, only to be killed by the silvery parasitic climbing vine that disguises the bare black branches and catches what little light falls in the Gutsink.

**Westgate** Is a small town built from the remains of an abandoned expedition to cut a viable path through the mountains, Westgate is the fourth smallest on the Amarantine coast of the five major settlements.

**Dovleac** The trigger that caused such poor relations between the Old Coast and the Amarantine Coast, Dovleac dished out the refined Iskran powder quickly, cheaply, though not always safely. It's speculated the explosion began in the massive refinery, though the town itself seemed not to suffer permanent damage the entire population, men, women and children of Dovleac, in which the laws of reality are suspended and just about anything can take place.

**Udara**  also known either as Crater City or Cable City,000 years ago. A messy tangle of rampant, unregulated building, renovation and demolition with a criss-crossing mesh of thick steel cables and towers that support the cable cars connecting the top of the crater to the lowest levels, Udara is bustling and active where very little in the way of silence exists, save for the deaf.

**Vesna** Initially developed as yet another branch of Behar's power

**Shivershore** Named for its continual growling and rumbling

**Mother Lake** A large body of water that feeds into the Stonewash, the lake bed consists of pale sand and jagged stones, similar to the contents of the Stonewash. Fish, shellfish and freshwater prawns feed the growing fishing industry in Vesna while also feeding the yearly population of breeding dragons and their young when they take the Wash for five months.

So in the hopes that it may inspire some of you

EDIT: These descriptions are based on the most current archaeological information I have found available.
__________________________

The first you arrive at is Tiryns. This was a major center of a mycenaean kingdom a half-century ago; a large fortress built atop a low bedrock ridge that rises above the surrounding plain. Its walls still stand, the *wanax*, is still used by the local ruler, around which has been built a smaller, less imposing structure than the kings of Tiryns once used. Indeed the man who now sits upon the throne is much weaker than his forefathers, as the local aristocrats now hold the reigns of power.

The citadel walls are surrounded by a bustling lower town. Just before the last palace fell

Inside the walls, dug by the palatial state to prepare the citadel for past wars.

In recent years since the collapse of the other palatial states
__________________________

As you travel along an old, situated as it is on a a hill above an important crossroads near the sea.

As rich as it was during the Mycenaean times, reacted to some new and yet unknown threat by coordinating an organized migration into the surrounding hills, leaving the town and its buildings to crumble and decay. While they no longer live there the Nichorians still return to the site to bury their dead in the ancestral tombs nearby, asserting their claim on the area with the bodies of their deceased. While they will eventually return to the site to rebuild a permanent village, the Nichorians will remain as nomads for the next 200 years.
__________________________

In the north of the Peloponnese, located on a rise right on the shore of the Corinthian Gulf. While the town had existed for at least 800 years before your arrival, during the time of the palaces it had shrunk to barely a small village. However during the instability immediately following the end of those kingdoms, people flocked to the site in large numbers and built a large community for themselves on this seaside hill.

The people here are organized much like the community among the ruins of Tiryns; wealthy aristocratic families provide the capital and organization for major construction projects, some larger than others. To the north of them all was constructed a large meeting house, where the prominent members of the community gather to discuss issues concerning the town as a whole. This council-house/megaron is positioned very close to the north cliffs, and in fact in later years will slip almost entirely into the sea below.

Monsters; creating them is easy but creating a good one is difficult. It is true that any monster you can think up of is probably already taken by some obscure culture or modern thinker we as humans follow a pattern to create the perfect boogey man and it’s predictable like the end of a chord progression. 



Things to think about before answering


**How should they look?** there are two opposing thoughts to this one being that they are totally alien to us and the other very near to us in appearance. The Neural system in our brains have been hard wired by evolution to hate certain features on creatures because they signal danger: take advantage of this formulate your creatures with that of the ones found in nature for she will always come up with something better than any of us can create(think the thing). The latter school of thought is the one most commonly found it takes ahold of the “Uncanny Valley effect” which is a theory in robotics that there is a certain point in which something is too human problem is modern culture has ruined a lot of the tropes(think vampire)




**Behavior** Not enough for looks (thought Frankenstein’s monster argues otherwise) it takes intent which once again is the dichotomy of plotting or random actions. The plotting intent is one most used because there is something quite disturbing about something that can out think us and this is used to great effect(think every alien) But instinct is also a valid choice as there is no reasoning it and it’s hard to out think something that doesn’t think. 




**Weakness** this is most important and what separates good monster from the bad and answers the basic question of why hasn’t my monster eating everything yet? It could be anything form prayers to the need to keep water in its head (kappa) the point is it needs to be killable by some force to keep the story compelling or be a monster not all the time. Remember the more difficult it is to obtain the weakness of the monster the less of them there should be unless there is an equal opposing force like angles ect*(Things such as old gods where the terror lies in that there is nothing you can do)



**The formula** (power + hiding abilities)/(weakness + Creation process)= Population of said monster




*Answering the question* who or what are your monsters? Describe them to us? How do you create your monsters? Where are they from? How do you stop them? Do your people know how to stop them? How did you come up with the idea?

So I'm trying to break it down into clearer rules, etc. I'm okay with a slightly less ""scientific"" system but I want it to be well structured and thought out. But I'm struggling with that.

I have certain things figured out

Here's where I am so far.

-There are three countries on one continent that are known to this narrative world

-building on that

-Think bloodlines but everyone originates from the same ancestors so everyone is part of the bloodline with magical ability.

-in the ""main"" country of the current novel I'm working on

-so ""shaping"" magic means people can understand something well enough to project how they want it to be onto the world and it will change...in some ways it's like naming (which appears in a few different series) but without the name concept. Basically

-to break that down. A mage could look at a block of wood and create a carved sculpture out of it by exerting their will (?) but only if they have the ability to carve that same sculpture in a non magical way. So a skilled artisan who can do high levels of magic can produce things on a nearly industrial-revolution level of efficiency

-so obviously the idea of shaping the earth itself is part of the mythology, fault lines, etc. You can't just make it magically appear a certain way just because you want it/can imagine it like that.

-Back in the creation myth time there was a second kind of magic, so no one actually have prophetic dreams, but the two magics combined and interact. Essentially, lucid dreaming can be a way of developing Shaping magic??

-that last bit is rough and should maybe be removed. 

-okay so things magic has to be able to do: I have working clockwork cars, like only a handful even exist, all made by the same person or small group of people? Possibly need some small amount of magical ability to run it but mostly goes on its own. No idea how this would work.

Also, whatever you do with the letters of one, also happens to the other. These are also very rare and expensive, used for military/royalty, maybe a few very wealthy merchants. Again, not sure how this would work, maybe something about the way it is made???

-finally, another story.

-so I think based on what I established, this implies other people would specialize as well.

It's not the most aesthetically pleasing
The Mountainbeard dwarves are a prosperous dwarven empire. Their homecity is Ironpeak
 The G'far swamp goblin clans are unorganized and poor
The Krong'rar orcs are fierce and savage. They pose a larger threat to the world then the goblins
The aseon elves are a tall elven race that lives in trees
The Vaosii Half-elves are a sea-faring miniature elf
The Injo Sultanha are a desert half-man-half-monkey sort of race. They are at war with the northmen, mercantile empire.                                                       
The avion are half-man-half-eagle/hawk. They have unique fishing boats
The northmen are slightly tall than orcs, but they are also honorable men, and get along with humans well.

I digress.

As happens when working on a project for so long, or put on a back burner.  I was going through my files today looking for something in particular, and I stumbled across an in-world letter written by one of the chroniclers of the setting.  I had completely forgotten that I ever wrote it, and reading it just now was really exhilarating as I felt no connection to it and could enjoy it as a piece.  Made me really happy.

It's a bit of a read

--------------

The following is a letter written by the historian Tanmun, but as an open letter to all who followed his work.

*The many years have not been kind to me, forcing me to hunch close to this tome as I write.  The fingers with which I clutch this quill—once dexterous and controlled—now cramp at a moment’s notice and shake feebly like the last leaves of autumn shake in fear of winter.  Were these not enough, my back has grown accustomed to this hunched posture and, though it aches greatly from this angle, I find myself less and less inclined to stand upright with each passing day.  I feel my time draws to a close, and the necessity to put my affairs in order instills in me a desire to compile at least one definitive history as it has thus far been revealed.*

*It is a strange thing to consider that I have never before thought to put the history of this world into one volume.  One would think such an idea would be the focus of my studies, allow us to grasp.  Yet for all the time, effort, sweat, and even blood that I have paid for my knowledge, it had simply never occurred to me until recently to put all I had learned into a single all-encompassing volume.*

*Perhaps it was not until recently that I even felt capable of undertaking such a challenge.  After all, compiled in its entirety, would fill far too many books to ever be considered a viable project.*

*Moreover my time has always been so filled with the collection of information, modifications according to debate over contradictions, assimilation into the overall work, and finally the organization of the continually growing number of volumes that I simply never would have thought I had time to pen such a volume as to contain the history of the entire world, no matter how brief.*

*Finally, and that is such an arbitrary and silly way to end a book that I scoff at the mere notion.  If the world sees fit to continue its course with tale upon tale, I will happily chronicle every last scrap of information that might be gathered.  It would be like telling the life story of a man—as is generally done at funerals—when he had not yet seen his tenth year.*

*Yet despite these reasons I now find myself at a time, broken world has done anything of the kind to my knowledge, and so I must admit to a not insubstantial swelling of pride when I consider the task before me.  It is an honor, and a tremendous pleasure.  How many can say they have ever been presented with the opportunity to undertake such a task, let alone had the capability of doing so?*

*For I now find that I do indeed feel I am up to the challenge of this endeavor, in fact, than I have ever been before.*

*That this confidence should arrive at such a time in my life, and assistants than ever before, is a fortuitous coincidence that is not lost on me.  I have not had this much free time in at least fifty years, before I ever set forth the effort to compile my first volume (at least, as counted by the passage of time here on this island, outside the time which passes through the rest of the world).  Now it almost feels strange, and every time one of the members of my order takes it as their task to work on one of the latest volumes I almost find myself resentful.  I remind myself however, that these young folk are every bit as dedicated as I am, I find my days less and less busy.*

*Finally, that I find myself with both the confidence and the time to undertake a project such as this at the same time that the events of these last few months (relatively speaking) have gone their course.  These are the events that define the transitions of ages.  They are the precise kind of monumental events that, were I to discover them in the world’s history, I would easily feel were significant enough to use as the point of definition between one age and another.*

*It has, but I hope I have managed to at least detach myself from such problems, if not remove myself entirely.  For one thing, the time distortion of this island should be enough to weaken the idea of the “present” for anyone here.  More importantly, I think I have seen enough centuries pass from my vantage point that I can judge these events in their proper context.*

*So, as I always do, that there is such suffering at the hands of the armies of both sides, as simple folk are caught in the maelstrom of holy war and royal greed.  All of the world joins in this bloody madness, eager to take sides as the Gods fight for followers, and their mortal representatives battle for land and power.  Yet as a historian, I cannot but feel excited to be witnessing such monumental events first hand.  Well

*Even in as distant and detached a form as reading the stars, the only people in this broken world who endeavor to record the entire thing, and so in a way we are a part of all that transpires.  So as horrible as these events are, as I stand in the scroll room and gaze at the forever night sky of the dome overhead, I feel connected to history in a way that I never have before.  This event, the transition of an age, is surely a time when one might pen the history of a world.*

*So, considering the events, I should take to referring to it as the previous age.  As for what this new age might bring, or what my successors will call it, I cannot say.  For now though, I am content, even pleased, at least as much as history can be.*

*By the Grace of Kelana*

I didn't have a clear consensus on what happened to the western desert states of the U.S, blade arms, lasers, that sort of thing. But it felt like stuff that had already been done before. I need to get ridiculous if I wanted to get unique. So I started adding the ability to transform into an animal form, like giant mecha bobcats, raptors, even smaller dragons. As long as a person had enough mechanical parts they could build  their body as they saw fit

This played a big part into the creation of their culture, but most members of the tribe have a deep knowledge of mechanical systems. The constant race for the most effective designs and the hostile competition pushing things forward quickly led to an extremely technologically advanced tribal society. It was kinda funny having a bunch of smart savages running around, and it also makes for a great ""big-evil"".

What I learned from building this society is that sometimes it's good to break away from normalcy and go crazy

**EDIT4:** So an idea i have is to have a large river flow from the mountains on the west coast all the way across the continent into the big ocean on the east coast.  Since they could sail ships up the river from the east coast
**EDIT5:** Most suggestions focus on making the narrow sea impassable which get the job done just as well (and perhaps even provides for ""cooler"" ideas so i have no complaints but i'd just like to mention
  

[Here's a really quickly done pic to help visualize.](http://i62.photobucket.com/albums/h103/mpude715/Untitled.png)  
So I'm world building for a story i'm writing and the really super condensed version is that the the world has two ""main"" continents and they are connected by a narrow isthmus in the arctic circle.  the eastern one is invading the western one.  there's a sea between them that's not too large but definitely ocean-scale and on the other side there is a much larger ocean and in that ocean is a highly-advanced island nation that sorta acts like the switzerland of the seas.  they have a mega navy and literally control the whole ocean.  they are also sworn to keeping the peace between the other two as far as the seas go.  they also posses a small sub continent south of the eastern one.  so the eastern land cannot attack the west with ships by sailing due east and going around the world.  they also can't attack by sailing ships from the east coast south around the continent to the west (and the north is blocked by ice).  
so that still leaves the option of building ships in the narrow sea between the two continents (the only body of water not controlled by the island-switzerland) and just sailing west across it.  
but i don't want them to be able to do that.  so how do i keep them from being able to just attack aquatically across the narrow sea?  
I first thought about having the narrow sea be infested by giant monsters but i really don't like that idea because i don't find it believable enough.  at the moment
i'm ok with the east somehow being able to build a few ships on the narrow sea coast just for the sake of the invasion, from which they could regularly build ships and sail around the narrow sea.",Question,False,self,t5_2rd6n,1342131914.0,,
1340687144.0,vm5cs,"This is my summary of ""The Structures of Everyday Life 15th-18th Century""",JJWest,33,3,17,"Fernand Braudel’s “The Structures of Everyday Life, and how much sugar was annually produced by Brazil. But the entire book itself was an interesting read

[Disclaimer] It took me a month or two to read it, not for my historical knowledge of Europe back then, so my summary may exclude certain details that I found unimportant.

Chapter 1: Weight of Numbers

* Population is directly proportional to industry. More people mean more production.
* There were population rises followed by declines until the 18th Century.
* These “ebbs and flows” of population were global and were a result of a natural equilibrium with Earth and its resources. Once the population exceeded a critical number
* One reason why populations exploded in the 18th century was due to colonization. Every country had access to much more land with its associated resources. 
* Another is climate. Braudel mentions the “little ice age” which began in the 14th century. He argues that the cooling led to fewer crops but once it resided
* Basically
* There were barriers to new land: mountain ranges, Siberia, North America).
* Europe’s huge achievement was mastery of the Atlantic Ocean
* Small populations led to infestations of wolves and bears, stags, bucks, hares and geese.
* Famines were widespread and led to massive drops in population. But after the drop
* Sometimes during famine there were armies of poor who stormed cities.
* After a few bad harvests
* During the Black Plague (and other disease epidemics) the poor were rounded up to be observed and the rich isolated themselves. One such explanation was the trade routes between Asia and Europe which made travel much easier for both humans the disease.
* Whenever civilizations are defeated

Chapter 2: Daily Bread

* Basically, and Rice. In Europe, wheat was reserved for the wealthy while the poor ate primarily rye bread or oats. When corn came from the America’s it provided much more yield per acre than anything else. Rice was primarily a product of East Asia until corn replaced it. This is a drastic simplification but guess what, this isn’t an academic paper.
* Populations could grow because of the increased food production agriculture yielded. However, and very rarely consumed meat because it also was expensive (since you had to grow food for the livestock). This is when the term “daily bread” originated since peasants consumed bread daily.
* Most peasants who grew wheat grew it only for export and sale
* The real winners in the grain trade were the merchants who bought the grain from the growers and sold it to the consumers.
* An interesting side note is that when a quintal of wheat exceeded 100 hours of labor to produce annually, famine set in.
* Rice lasts longer in storage than wheat
* Cornmeal or corn bread had to be supplemented by meat to be adequate.
* Potatoes lasted even longer than rice and as such became the basic staple crop of some cultures
* Populations struggled outside of the hoe-cultivation belt

Chapter 3: Superfluity and Sufficiency: Food and Drink

* Sugar was a luxury before the 16th century. Pepper was a luxury before the 17th. And so was alcohol.
* Forks were frowned upon until the 18th century. They were viewed as barbaric. In fact
* Chairs were sort of a rarity; instead benches were used.
* Peasants never ate their best produce; they saved that for sale
* The entire meal was piled high onto one plate to form a single dish. All components were there and on one plate and were self-served by hand from the middle of the table.
* The leftovers of the rich were sold to food-dealers
* The spoon did not become popular until the 16th century
* A German preacher condemned the fork: “God would not have given us fingers if he had wished us to use such an instrument.”
* One such method to eat involved putting the entire main dish onto one plate or bowl
* Salt was necessary for everyday life; it preserved food and baked bread. In fact it served as currency sometimes.
* Most cheeses
* Cheese was a cheap source of protein that lasted longer than other sources of protein.
* Fishing was pretty important
* You can’t talk about food without talking about spices or pepper, nutmeg and ginger. Braudel describes it as a mania. Pepper was the number 1 spice. But as spices declined, coffee, chocolate, alcohol and tobacco rose. An interesting thing to note is that meat consumption declined with spice consumption, which leads to the conclusion that spices were used to spruce up bad meat… does this mean that the spices were limited to the rich who could afford to consume meat?
* Sugar began as a cure for illness. But sugar cane was imported to Europe to turn into raw sugar.
* Water was purified from rain water through natural sand filters.
* Wine was produced by a small part of Europe but it was consumed by everyone.
* Hops were added to beer to preserve it. Beer was consumed generally by the poor
* Coffee came from the Arabs
* Black tea is tea that is cured in sunlight which then ferments it. Green tea is tea cured from fire.
* Gin was produced in England
* Like tea
* Dude seriously, but spread to Europe and seriously is really good. I like Coffee.
* Tobacco was frowned upon initially because it was thought to make people lazy basically

Fantasy races, sociological races, whatever. Describe the race, write a future history of them, write a story featuring one. Just make is fun to read. 

[Here's an example I did a while ago.](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/mkvt7/creating_races_for_your_world/c31ut3w)
&gt; So let's create a race of giant forest troll. These giants eat only lichen and moss from rocks, using their large rough leathery hands to scrape moss off rocks and suck it off their fingers. Because they need to eat so much, the giants rarely see each other throughout the long winter months, coming together only in the summer in small groups in the peak of the wet months of summer to speak quickly, breed, and collectively teach their young the history of the tribe. A troll will be pregnant for a whole year, give birth during the summer

&gt; When alone or with its child for over ten months a year, and trolls hold it sacred and will not speak of it in quick tongue. There are some forest shaman who insist on being able to understand it, calling it the song of the trees, saying that the trolls use it not to speak to each other (for the deep tones can be heard for miles and miles, filling an entire valley with the song of one giant) but to the forest itself, conversing with the trees to ease their solitude.

&gt; Giants are so rare that a small human settlement can be on the edge of a forest breeding ground and might not come across a troll except once a generation or two. While fearsome large and ugly things, trolls are mostly peaceful unless threatened, and little can threaten a full grown troll beyond the largest of warg packs.

&gt; So remember next time you're in the woods and the trees begin to howl with melancholy, but she is there; slurping moss, nursing her child, singing to the woods.

Anyway



First, either due to it being strictly controlled or (most likely) a quirk of the physics or the technology, *it is not possible to travel within the same timeline from which you started*. What I mean by that is that when someone travels through time, they also travel to another universe that is effectively identical to our own. If there is a difference, it would be something like a quantum particle in a dinosaur's toe wiggled to the right instead of the left. Because of the alternate universe thing, there is no need to worry about paradoxes or causing a loved one to never be born or other problems that usually arise in time travel fiction.

Oh, let's say), things from the same time but different universes cannot travel to the same universe. So no alternate-universe-doubles bumping into each other or other issues that would arise from that. Maybe it's a little bit like magnets of the same polarization. Objects that have similar temporal energies but dissimilar spacial/universe energies are repelled away from each other while in the ""time-stream"" or whatever.



So! One can obviously think of a multitude of reasons that people would want to use this (relatively speaking) safe time travel tech. Colonization, religion (how many Christian folks wouldn't love to make a pilgrimage to meet ol' Jesus/Yeshua? Or how many Buddhists would jump at the chance to seek enlightenment under the direct tutelage of Gautama Buddha?), or even more nefarious aims.



Now for the setting proper, perhaps some time between the 1200's and 1400's. I'm imagining that the ""future-folk"" (probably not what I'll actually call them in the setting) have set up a colony somewhere on the planet during that time, though while the colony itself is very out of the way (Antarctica might work well), the colonists are far from adverse to interacting with time-natives. They would likely have a general policy of non-interference, but it would be more of a guideline then a rule. This opens the door for the culture, ideas, technology



One of the biggest things that would effect the world would be the technology of the colonists. To the natives, though likely would truly understand very little about it.

One example might be a sword that is said to be ""enchanted with fire"", etc. The possibilities are quite numerous!



While it would be tempting to go overboard with this idea (FLYING LASER VIKINGS!!), or teleportation tech allowing for a safe and reliable means of trade and cultural exchange between Europe and the Far East. Or if things get *really* crazy, the Anglo-Saxons getting their hands on a nuclear device during William the Conqueror's invasion of England! A big focus would be events or ideas coming about well before their time, as well as making subtle changes that lead to major historical events unfolding very differently.



Well, make suggestions, even poke holes in it! I know that a setting like this would be quite a precarious balancing act, but if it's pulled off well I would see this setting being infinitely fun and fascinating!

___________________________________________________________
Warlock: Of all the Paths, a pool of raw power that grows as the Warlock draws upon it, each use of his power making his available Mana grow in size. But the Path of the Warlock is fraught with danger. If a Warlock overextends himself his own life-force is converted into Mana. Many an arrogant or inexperienced warlock has accidently spent their entire life force attempting a spell beyond them. Of all the Paths, that of the Warlock is the most feared, as a Warlock has access  to a pool of Mana without the training required by the Wizard, or the discipline required by the determined, nor the limitations imposed upon the Necromancer.
___________________________________________________________
Wizard: The Wizard is one of the more common Paths in Ealdgaldor, who forged the world. These Words are intertwined with the wild Mana of the world, and speaking them unleashes this power , shaped by the base word, and the will of he that speaks it. The more fluent one is in the language, and the stronger his will, the less words he must speak. A master can do more with one word than a novice with ten. Speaking the Language of power is taxing to those not of the Ealdcynd, they risk passing out.
___________________________________________________________
Necromancer: Necromancers are chosen by the Spirits of the dead. In return for acting on the behalf of the dead, and acting as a bridge and mediator between them and the living, the dead grant the Necromancer Power, allowing him to draw Mana from their essence. The Necromancer is a Path that requires an open mind, and a willing heart. To be a Necromancer is to walk a narrow path between the dead and the living, a keeper of the peace of the Dead, their agent in Life. It is a calling as much as a Path, he could find himself powerless.
___________________________________________________________
The Determined: Perhaps the most respected Path in Ealdgaldor, dedication and training to do this. A Determined may spend months, even years training before he can muster enough Mana through willpower for even the simplest of spells. Why would one bother with such a complicated method instead of the much easier path of the Wizard? Once he has mastered his will, a Determined can summon as much Mana as his will can control, with the only limit being the strength of his will. The reward of such a disciplined path is great, and Determined are almost universally looked upon with respect for their strength of will and devotion to the strength of mind required by the Path.
___________________________________________________________
Summoner: Perhaps the most  wild of the Paths, and proposes a partnership. In exchange for protection and acting in the spirits interest, the Summoner receives Mana from the spirit. He physically merges with the spirit, becoming one new being. He is limited by the fact that the Mana he gets is determined by how many spirits he has merged with, and how powerful the spirit was. They take on characteristics of whatever spirit or spirits they have merged with. The original spirit essentially ceases to exist as does the original Summoner as the two merge into a new being.
___________________________________________________________
The Possessed: Feared and misunderstood even more than the Warlock is the Possesed. For too often, unlike the Summoner. The Spirit provides the raw Mana the Possessed uses to cast his spells. Sometimes the union is an equal partnership, but an apparent majority of Possessed are controlled by the very spirit that gives them Mana. Like with the Summoner, the amount of Mana the Possessed can call upon is limited to the strength and number of spirits. But unlike the Summoner, the spirit can be cast out or have the tables turned on it, if the one Possessed is of strong enough will.

I've got this magic system that's been in my head for a while. I've always thought it would be a lot of fun to use in a story. This is the first time I've written it down. Feel free to point out bad ideas

  The magic system in my world is a leftover from the days of powerful mages and magical warfare. Before all of the mage types died out they experimented on their soldiers

  The soldiers(officers) eventually become the present day nobles. Since large groups of soldiers were often experimented on at once, but every noble family will come from one of the Houses. Maybe commanding officers become the ruling Families, while enlisted would be equal to merchant-class. I've only got the magic system so far, so I haven't decided how big to make the world, but it'll have to be several kingdoms, just to fit all of the Houses and the general population.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As for the House abilities

(I haven't settled on House or ability names

 * **Strength-shifter** (House of Monster Girl)  - This House greatly increases strength and durability [by shifting into their battle-mode.](http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/308/98958-95439-monster-girl.jpg) For the durability, but they won't be lifting 60 tons. I'm thinking strong enough to throw around 2,000 lbs easily. They could hit you with your own horse without breaking  a sweat. Strong but slow, they won't be going anywhere in a hurry. Often hired as mercenaries, but make excellent blacksmiths due to their resistance to fire. 

 * **House Coyote** (Animal shifter)- This one is pretty much what it says. They can turn into any animal, they need 15-20 minutes to do it. They won't have as much practice in their non-standard form, and won't be able to hold it as long. Scout types and spies, you can usually tell where someone in this House is from based on their animal forms. 

 * **Shadowstep** - This House has the ability to teleport through shadows or darkness, or in a dark room these guys would be able to teleport anywhere.  During the day, they are limited to shadows. The non-noble Families are often hired as assassins, and assassin prevention.

 * **Speedster** - This House ability is one I'm not really sure about yet. Super speed seems like it would be pretty overpowered. It would have to be watered down. I'm thinking a top speed of 100 mph. They'll have better than human stamina and incredible reflexes and agility, they're also pretty handy in a fight as long as they don't get tripped up.

 * **Demonic Binding** - This House can summon and bind demons and otherworldly beings to their own bodies. They accomplish this through rituals that only their House can perform. The most common  bindings this House uses are ones that grant them abilities similar to other Houses. They can do this by taking on a demon's form(usually a more powerful demon) or binding multiple weaker demons to their bodies. The latter method is preferred

 * **Apollo style, but he's what inspired the idea. They'll be really strong and durable as long they are exposed to sunlight. At least equals to the Monster Girl House. Without direct sunlight, they burn their power off in about an hour of use. Right now, I'm including flight in this package, but it burns power slightly faster than they can restore it. I think that'll keep them from being too godly. 

 * **Makin Prophet** (edited in)- Precognitive House. This is a very difficult ability to master. Most in this House just use it to stay a little bit ahead in fights, as they are nearly impossible to hit. The elders in this House retreat to House temples to focus their ability, dispensing advice to Family heads and training the next generation in the use of their ability.

 * **House Conscriptus** (Captain America-type, but cannot take as much damage as the Monster Girl or Apollo Houses. They heal faster than normal humans as well. 1/2 of the regular human recovery time with major injuries 1/3 time for minor injuries. This house will be one of the bigger, more widespread ones, as there were more general troops than specialty ones in the days of the mages.  

 * **House Basilisk** (edited in) - This House has the ability to stun or hypnotize people. Beginning users of this ability can temporarily paralyze somebody. More experienced users can charm others into doing their bidding. Eye contact is necessary. Ancestors of this House would have been interrogators and prison wardens.

1369062582.0,1ep3vu,"The Planetary Empire of Shamash: Its history, culture, and government.",Shagomir,34,9

Shamash is a vast, and a surface area 260% the size of Earth's. Due to the size of the planet, surface gravity is moderately high at 1.14 G. The planet is a bit warmer than Earth, with an average temperature of 297 K (or 76 degrees Fahrenheit). Shamash also has an axial tilt of 38 degrees, creating a very broad tropical belt and leading to a very even distribution of temperatures and climate. 

Due to the vastness of the continents (there are two large continents over 150 million square km in size, there are huge areas of desert, scrub, and other wasteland. The shores of the warm oceans are lashed by storms and have quite dense vegetation, but a few hundred km inland the climate is very pleasant and quite habitable, as the intense rains subside and create a more Mediterranean climate. 

Shamash has a day that is 30 hours long, Mars-like atmosphere. Bel is an M0V star, and appears as a orange orb in Shamash's sky, more than 25 times larger than the Sun in Earth's sky (it has an apparent diameter of about 2.6 degrees, compared to .5 degrees for the Sun). The reddish light of the star causes the skies on Shamash to have an orange-yellow color. Plant life on Shamash is extremely dark to absorb as much of the weak sunlight as possible, and the seas are a dark blue-green.  

[Map of Shamash](http://i.imgur.com/qbwrL1q.png)

###History

Shamash was founded as the second major Human colony in CY 39 (2863 CE). Due to the political climate at the time, working together in a planetary senate for the purposes of large-scale governance. Eventually, this system ended up enfranchising former military members to such a degree that the planet became a militaristic empire in a pseudo-feudal structure. 

In CY 80, he organized the provincial militias into the Shamash Planetary Legion and installed himself as the commander-in-chief of these forces. During the chaos at the end of the war, he was able to maneuver the planetary senate into making him the permanent commander of the Legion. Over time, with the support of the military, he fashioned himself into the first Emperor of Shamash, and was first acknowledged as such in CY 86. 

Over his nearly 50-year reign, the Benefactors, and the Emperor. He also began a program to create the ultimate soldiers for the legion, including a massive breeding and cloning program. Under his rule, the population exploded from 20 million to 200 million, and he rewarded his supporters by creating new provinces and putting them in power. By the end of his reign in CY 133, he was known as Emperor Bel-Zander. He is considered to be a great hero by the people of Shamash, the third major human colony. 

After the death of the first Emperor, but the protocol for succession had been stabilized. 

Successive Emperors surrendered much of their power to the Imperial Senate, in CY 190 the Emperor's duties were limited to the nomination of provincial governors and ensuring the stability and integrity of the planetary government. He serves as the ceremonial head of state, and sits on the Admiralty Council. He appoints one representative to the Colonial Senate (the remainder are chosen by the Imperial Senate), and sits on the Colonial Navy's Admiralty Board as the highest-ranking military officer on Shamash. Currently (as of CY 215) the planet is ruled by Emperor Bel-Kezar III, the eighth Emperor of Shamash. He has ruled since CY 213 and is generally well-liked by the Senate and people of Shamash. 

###Culture


Shamash has a diverse culture, especially in the more well-settled parts of the planet. The largest province is the Imperial Seat of Ur, which contains the capital, the Emperor's palace, and the seat of the Imperial Senate. Ur is a large megalopolis of over 110 million people, but only the central district of Ur (along with extensive lands in the outlying area) is part of the Imperial Fief. The rest of the city is broken up into dozens of Urban provinces, which are the domains of some of the oldest and most powerful families on Shamash. 

The people generally enjoy a high quality of life, secret police, and other organizations dedicated to maintaining order. There is a limited degree of representation available to the citizens, but full citizenship rights depend on military or public service. 

Due to the high gravity on Shamash, jet-black ziggurat that looms over the capital, containing thousands of rooms, courtyards, and gardens to house the Emperor, his servants, and his personal guard. Splayed around the capital are thousands of non-descript housing units, and industrial facilities. The city is built on a large hill

###Military

The military of Shamash, they maintain the largest number of troops in the United Colonies, exceeding even the United Colonies Navy in manpower. Their focus is on ground combat, and taking and holding planets. To this end, they have a massive fleet of troop transports, and have participated in many of the UC Navy's interventions on Amazonia and other worlds. Troop numbers across the Legion exceed 20 million individuals, with many more in reserve. 

The main forces of the Legion are equipped to fight in any conditions

###Government

Shamash is ruled by the Imperial Senate and the Emperor. The Senate is made up of military officials and provincial governors. Governors may be elected, depending on the local traditions. Military appointments are made by the Senate with the advice of the Emperor. The Emperor is also appointed by the Senate, as this is also technically a military rank, though his powers as commander-in-chief have been largely legislated away. 

Succession is determined by a vote in the Senate, especially during the First Interregnum.

Local government of the Provinces is left to the Provincial Governors

The emblem of Shamash is the Sun of Bel-Shamash in Black and Gold on a red field. Shamash is traditionally represented by the colors black and red

I had this idea of making magic really based on the rules of physics. That isn't an expandable force, transfers from one thing to the other.

*Example*

Using magic to lift a rock

**Source of Magic**

Everything has a source

**Death**

If someone dies they travel to a different plain of existence known as the Spiritworld. In this place the world is ruled by magic and there is no physical presence capable of surviving. The body kept the Soul from getting damaged

Certain mages are capable of summoning the souls of those that have died

Two souls in the same body is dangerous. It can equally lead to madness (mixing up their memories

An older soul is more powerful

There are items that can remove the soul from a living person. These people are known as Gentled

**Forms of Magic**

This is where I'm still a bit incapable of making this work. 

I want there to be a form of magic that is ""passive"". A Gift

Then a second form of magic would be to use their soul to influence an element (fire, wind).

A third form is still undefined

In my world the season a person is born in influences a lot. Which is why I want to make four types of mages

SUMMER

Life-Mages

*Gift of The Healer*

Healing others, restoring the soul.

*Element Air*


AUTUMN

Power-Mages

*Gift of The Scholar*

knowing future, having a great memory, reading a mind.

*Element Fire*


WINTER

Death-Mages

*Gift of the Outcast*

Shapeshifting (if the subject is dead), removing magic

*Element Earth*


SPRING

Love-Mages

*Gift of the Dancer*

manipulating minds

*Element Water*

1365556927.0,1c15v1,Let's discuss lifespan,Asurnasurpal,33,4,24,"Now

For obvious reasons,"" but in harder or more grounded works, it can be important to get aging just right.

The rule of thumb I use for making races is to match up how physically active a race can be with how old they can live. This helps avoid making races that live for thousands of years and can move in the blink of an eye and stay beautiful forever and have this super-advanced technology and I think you get the idea. You should never have a species comprised almost entirely of Mary S(t)us. Matching up activity with age feels more believable to humans. After all, and trees can live several thousand. Even if you have good explanations for *why* the rules are different for you, it'll often sit better on your audience's tongue if they can use rules they're familiar with right off the bat.

If you have a character that's lived much longer than human beings, and unless their own lives are threatened, they'll see whatever disaster is looming on the horizon as less dire, and more a short-term inconvenience than a great threat. If they care for other races, it's unlikely they'll see them as peers. It's hard to hold people who are so fundamentally different to the same standards you hold yourself.

If the being isn't supposed to live that long

On the other hand, as they'll pass away much sooner.

The other big piece of giving a good lifespan for your race regards technological advancement. In the wild, this reaches sixty by the high middle ages in Europe, and currently sits at around the mid to late eighties. (Note: these numbers aren't factoring child mortality.)

The progression from humans without tools to the middle ages represents more than anything else the development of agriculture and ""civilization."" Specialization and a more stable food source ensure that more people can live longer in a smaller area

As we go further into the future, and 180 at 3000AD.

1365082506.0,1bnqvm,My Fantasy Species: the Feathered,Anerisyn,30,1,18,"*Caution:* Non-map content ahead.

I'm looking for some feedback. Are there any interesting aspects or important points I left out? Are there any inconsistencies?

**The Feathered**

**Anatomy**

Think of tall people with feathers and with long wings *instead* of arms. It always bugged me that humanoid birds had wings and arms. It doesn't make senese. Well

They are able to fly but it's exhausting to do for them all day. They prefer to walk on planes if they aren't in a hurry. So they build short ways/streets but they would never build stairs.

[Drawing](http://i.imgur.com/xmVawHZ.jpg)

**Naming and Language**

The humans call them Farafynet (sg.: Farafyn) which means ""feathered"". In their own languages they call themselves ""ZatPasTapTekTek"". This language is based on the limited sound set they can do comfortably. Some of them learn human languages but they have problems speaking them.

**Living Environment**

They live in the mountains. Most forests are to dense for them and they prefer quite cold and moderately humid areas. They shape their environment building big nest-like constructions out of sticks and stones. Sometimes they use big stones more for important constructions like holy places (think stone henge).

**Society**

They live in small villages of around 50 individuals. There are no specific gender roles so hunting and taking care of the young and the nests are evenly split. But war and leading positions are more often taken care of by the male. Inside this villages they share nearly everything.

In everyday live they do what they are good at to help the village. They might change their work everyday. Adjustment by the village leadership is only sometimes needed. Some special mostly religious positions are inherited.

Every year they group in pairs for mating. These pairs are publically announced and are similar to marriages but just for one year. This can be same pairs every year but they don't have to. Both parents take responsibility for the eggs and later the children. But the village as a whole functions as the family and does parenting.

[If they just choose partners from their own villages

**Culture**

Their culture is mostly spoken. They give their stories

They have a writing system but nearly nobody uses it. It is just there for ethernal laws etc. To write they carve letters in wood or soft stone with their beak.

**Politics**

The villages are mostly self-organized. But they have a government with a monarch in a capital. This government understands itself as single authority of the species and is accepted by most villages. Some human mining towns are associated. The Feathered help with transportion and protecting the towns and get goods back which they can't produce themselves.

Some Feathered don't accept the government and live in independent villages or with the humans in their towns.

**Magical Abilities**

[My magic system is logics based ([see post](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/yiem0/how_does_magic_work_in_your_own_world/c5vxu74?context=3)). It's based on an aether-like energy field which all matter interacts with. Magicians can feel and manipulate this field to make the matter react.]

Most of the Feathered are very good at feeling the magic energy. Many are good at low-energy high-precision magic such as telepathy. They bring the magic energy field into vibration which can be felt far away. They represent feelings and emotions in a natural manner. Living creatures recieve these even if they don't generally feel the magic energy. Animals and non-magician sapient creatures can't distinguish these messages from their own feelings. The Feathered use telepathy for long range communication

My problem is: How do they obtain food?  Traditional fishing is out: the ocean is far too dangerous even not during the twenty-seventh day event.  And the usual farming villages can't exist: not enough protection.  So

My current ideas:

1) Skyship fishing - Airships use large nets and skim close-ish to the water

2) Temporary farming on undefendable islands - People plant large crops on abandoned islands, and are left safe afterwards.

3) Aerial hunting - Airships follow and poach from large flocks of birds.  Might possibly create bigger birds to emulate whaling.

4) Cloudwood foraging - One of the more interesting aspects of cloudwood is that is often (but not always) found as an airborne, connected by entwined roots and branches.  Other forms of life also inhabit these floating forests, and as such, they can be harvested for fruit and wild game.  (Other forms of cloudwood can be found floating on sea, or occasionally on higher plateaus.)

Most books that are made specifically about world building do cover topics of interest; culture, religion, magic; but all of these topics are only given brief overviews. 

I'd like to know if anyone has any suggestions for books that are not made for world building but cover these sorts of topics in much greater detail.

For example, and magic as well as many different cultures. 

Book topics could be from science regarding meteorology or geology to books on aquatic life to the types of food eaten by different cultures during different time periods. 

I think it would just be helpful to have a collection of *source books* to look to when searching for help on different world building topics. 

*I will be adding all suggestions to the list below and hopefully move the list to a more permanent area for future reference to those looking for help. All links are to amazon but these books are sold by many different carriers.*

**World Building:**

I enjoyed the different topics covered and hadn't thought of some, the only issue is the book has some misspellings and bad grammar. Many sources or references are also out of date but nonetheless it is an interesting read. There are more in this series of books that I have not read yet.

**spoons - instructed - quantification**

*The silver spoons of an unnamed petty god*

These silver *spoons* are found in a small chapel hall within a mysterious kingdom far away. The chapel once bared the name of a petty god

The silver spoons, random task to undergo. If the wielder of the spoons does as *instructed*, regardless of the moral implications of the deed, the hold of the spoons is allowed the multiplication of any given item. The *quantification* of this multiplication is as random as the deed provided by the petty god. It is believed, however, that some have become vastly rich using these silver spoons of an unnamed petty god. Regardless, few have struck the spoons in many generations. Some claim it is nothing more than a fairy tale meant to bring visitors to this out of the way chapel. 

It is still unsure to the current holders of the spoons if each spoon must resonate a certain pitch in a certain order to summon this petty god or if any of the spoons may be struck at the correct pitch. Many believe the initial is true.

## This Week

War! Huh. What is it good for? Typically, I mean ""absolutely nuthin'"".

Let's talk about ""Warfare"" in our worlds. Why are wars fought? Are they always just for conquering land, or are wars often attrition-based, guerrilla actions, or insurgencies? Or are wars even more unconventional, and instead of violence and death they are fought with economic means, or religious, or social?

The deadline for this challenge will be **Wednesday

## Next Week

What is a dwarf? A short, ""Remix: Dwarves"".

There are a number of common aspects we ascribe to dwarves: short and stocky, stalwart fighters, industrious, greedy, often armed with axes or hammers.

A few days ago, dwarves can become ""cave adapted"", that is, they become so used to the dark confines of their underground fortresses that the next time they emerge into the open again they can become ""sun sick"".

But what if your dwarves didn't live in subterranean tunnels? What about desert dwarves or sea dwarves or forest dwarves? Or what if they did live in tunnels

""Aboriginal"" representing either iron age germanic, as population densities are far more dense in the last 5 centuries (modern) than the first millennia.

The byzantine/germanic numbers explain a 'setting' that is very different to a much sparser aboriginal 'setting'.

""Byzantine Age"" is about the 300-1300s where germanic and arabic populations would have been far more dense because of farming and town making... evidence shows highly dense populations only started appearing much later.

The aim of the book is to provide an account of how religion emerges and develops in history. It mainly focuses on the history and philosophy of religion

To give one example, Belief, and Rationalization, and he describes 'ritual' as emergent from evolution (similar to the concept of [Memes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme) )

&gt;  Ritual goes back beyond the dawn of history. It can be discerned in the animals, according to the quality of the emotion excited.

On this account then, this represents a way to develop a race's religion directly out of its evolutionary origins. Take the habitual instinct of [Jumping in Dolphins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolphin#Jumping_and_playing) for instance; should dolphins continue to evolve in terms of intelligence, such activity might become vestigial; it would no longer have direct relevance for the dolphin to its preservation. The act of jumping over the waves would then be a 'ritual' of these intelligent dolphins which could potentially develop into belief, myth, and eventually religion: perhaps a belief regarding the 'ocean' of air above the ocean of water, a myth surrounding dolphins which swim above the waves, and a religion expressing faith in salvation through flight. The example is simplified; taking other parts into account would allow these transitions to be much more nuanced (and interesting), and right alongside the races of your worlds.

I worked on it by first making the world map, economy, etc. until I got bored then move on to a new place to map out.

There is a lot more information just in my head about the nations and their religions and societies (mostly about the eastern continent

The goal of the project was to make a world large enough to support realistic histories and complex enough to seem authentic. The basic theme was essentially ""authenticity"" as what I hoped to achieve in the end was a world that was consistent and realistic in almost ALL aspects, etc.), weather (currents, jet streams), sociology (movement and blending of cultures, governmental structure, trade relationships), city design, and fictional flora and fauna (albeit limited within reason

The Steel path is the means of achieving the co-ordination of these two. It teaches that the samra is the more important part. Having no umra makes us beasts
The key balance is expressed thusly – while each person may benefit from another’s help, however, is not the same ‘relying’ as it is to have someone else provide for you.

This distinction makes the Steel Path a reasonably egalitarian religion. It recognises that the buying or selling of goods is a contract between (theoretically

Samra is the key aspect of the Steel Path. It is, creativity, wisdom or knowledge. An adherent of the Steel path must work to achieve enlightenment here on earth and thus in the afterlife. Through work, the adherent breaks the bonds that hold him down – dependence on others. By gaining self-reliance, an adherent becomes spiritually free, allowing them to break the chains that hold him to the world when he dies (i.e. reincarnating him) and achieve enlightenment.

The Steel path is reasonably flexible in that it does not teach what our goals should be, it is vital that an adherent achieves it through their own ability. Indeed, it is stressed that it is better not to advance than to advance with help. Even if you do not advance on your own merits now, you might do so later, or achieve other victories. Getting help, however, taints all future victories.

One place where the Steel path requires deeper thought is on the subject of children who, for parents, it is a worthy goal to bring up children to know the Path and thus be ready to achieve Enlightenment on their own at a later date. To do that, they must aid the children until they are fully formed and grown.

For a long time I've been considering a sort of New Weird/urban fantasy setting based on the following premise: A long time ago, vampires, garuda, etc. etc. They were able to travel between worlds using the gates whenever they wanted, until one day when every gate suddenly closed at the same time. Any of the creatures who happened to be Earthside when the gates closed were now stranded here forever, essentially refugees who had to adapt to their new home.

Think *Stargate* with some China Miéville and Jim Butcher thrown in for inspiration

The story is set on modern day Earth

1) There is a sizeable population of supernatural critters (many of them quite inhuman) lurking under their very noses.

2) Magic exists, only converted). And it's more like a tool than anything. For example, unless you have an advanced degree in neurobiology, trying to magically brainwash someone would end very poorly. Think ""performing brain surgery with a three-foot-long rusty scalpel while drunk and blindfolded"".

Herein lies my problem: **On a modern-day Earth where magic must operate (more or less) according to the laws of physics

The more I think about it, the constant ability to take photos and record video with your phone, sites like Reddit that allow people the world over to share any sort of strangeness that they encounter … Even the most carefully hidden society would slip up eventually. **Can anyone think of any good justifications or realistic ways for the supernatural to remain hidden?**

And part two of the question: **What are some reasons that the supernatural community would even *want* to stay hidden?** The obvious one would be that humans outnumber them and have guns. But a leprechaun could use an AK-47 just as well as a person, declare war on humanity, and start rounding up pregnant women so they can eat their fetuses?

Even if (by some miracle) the supernatural world was able to escape the gaze of spy satellites and the nasties were forced to keep the peace and not reveal themselves

## Last Week

We got some mouthwatering submissions for our challenge of Culinary Anthropology, using magic to infuse herbs and spices directly into the living meat of a cow.

## This Week

Most of our worlds have one or two regions that are extremely harsh environments, too dry, too windy, or too extreme in any respect. But harsh environments breed hardy people. Tell us all about how a culture might adapt to survive and even thrive in an extreme environment.

As a reminder, so it might be easy to earn the judge's award this week with, say, a description of colonists settling an alien planet in your scifi setting. Perhaps a hell-world like Venus where sulfuric acid rains from the sky and the temperature on the surface is hot enough to keep lead molten, or a floating colony built in the swirling storms high up in a gas giant's atmosphere. Just sayin'! Be creative!

Although this week's challenge is getting a late start (sorry

## Next Week

Next week's challenge will be ""Megastructures"". The Pyramids of Giza, the Three Gorges Dam is a mindblowing undertaking, and some day in the future we might get to orbit cheaply by riding a space elevator. These might all be called megastructures, requiring years of labor from hundreds or thousands of workmen and the design ingenuity of geniuses.

So what megastructures are in your world? Are they completed and in use? Abandoned and in ruin? Or maybe half-completed when the culture building it was destroyed

LONG: Okay

In the past 20-some years, to the point that it could be used to lift very large objects (IE: airships, small islands, etc). I haven’t thought this through too much so that part may need some refining (more on that later).

The problem is that early excitement and economic success from increasing travel distance, it is becoming apparent to the informed that the current way of life is not sustainable and the countries and powers that don’t have abundant natural deposits of this element will find themselves at the mercy of those that do…

Basically airships are the cars of today, canyons, rivers, oceans, etc, that would make an airship more feasible then say trains and basic autos. I’m also thinking airships would be the metal war engines that early 1900 dreadnaughts were, something like a status of power, so the issue of neighbors and races for power is still undecided.

The three nations (unnamed) would basically be an Empire, promotion and rank is aptitude based, military tech is uniform and regimented. Strong national pride, weak natural resources.

The Kingdom is set up sort of like medieval Europe. There is a royal family, duchy’s, etc that owe allegiance and give a portion of taxes but can have their own laws and customs that slightly differ from place to place. The military is not uniform like the empire. Each duke, count, lord, whatever would have a family airship(s) and military force as needed to protect their realm. They’d be an all male military and look down on the Empire for having females. The fighter pilots would be knights, and the airships a Lord's heirloom and family symbol of power. The kingdom benefits from stronger natural resources

The merchant republic is the last big power and it’s a free collection of cities with democratically elected leaders. There is no ‘military’ per say

Magic in my world comes from another plane that frequently intersects with the physical world. These intersection points ""leak"" magical energy into the world and these energies, earthquakes, or the auroras.

The magical plane is divided into different realms, will spread magical disease and mutate local fauna into horrible monsters. One pointed towards Ashi, the goddess of natural beauty, might create pools of regeneration at a spring.

The first magic users were the priests and priestesses of the world, rather than the random vectors and gods with which the points are created. These holy and unholy orders exist to this day, constantly searching for new holy and unholy places to build their monasteries and temples around. They frequently do battle with each other over key intersection points.

The second magical tradition to arise was ""practical magic."" These wizards and witches learned to use the magical flora and fauna, but they were nevertheless helpful to the villages and communities near which they lived. While the prominence of these ""hedge wizards"" was to be reduced greatly after the Mages Guild was created, there are still many countless who operate within the realm, continuing to use spells and traditions passed down orally for thousands of years.

The prominence of the mages and the creation of their guild came from those hedge wizards who chose to dedicate their intellectual powers to the study of the magic which they practiced. Rules were discovered, dedicating their lives to creating new and more efficient spells for members of the guild to use.

The system of magical writing is, she sees only the components of the spell that she can understand. A higher level mage, by contrast, would see all the component parts. He could then deconstruct the spell and build new spells with similar components. I see magical writing as almost a kind of programming language; those who are more experienced can take apart and understand the machine language of the individual APIs, while basic users can only use the higher level APIs and objects.

While the mages have one written form of language

Each spell takes energy to cast, while Orcs can develop within a matter of months. Orcs in turn can continue to mutate into Ogres or worse. 

So, I'm also not trying to create anything brand new. That's ok with me, so please refrain from sharing how boring you think elves and dwarves are for storytelling purposes. My concerns are more with taking a traditional fantasy story and giving it internal and logical consistency rather than reinventing the wheel. High fantasy can be really fun, but you have to work to make sure things don't get out of hand.

The Eternal Architect is a visionary, laboring to achieve some grand design. The Archons who employ this magic are inventors, artisans, and leaders. Their tools, art, and laws are all imbued with magical potency. As with all Eidolonic magic, their bodies are reshaped to resemble their chosen medium.

**The Whispering Spider:** A long-favored Eidolon of the elites of the Anthalmisa Republic and conspiratorial Archons everywhere, and subtle manipulation. Archons who employ this magic are stealthy and secretive. They pull the strings that bind society like a puppeteer, conjuring these strings into physical existence for a variety of purposes. These Archons have a tendency to grow increasingly paranoid and reclusive. The physical transformation is dramatic, with the Archon gaining additional eyes and limbs, which do not always resemble their human equivalents. Fortunately, the magic of the Whispering Spider includes the means to obscure their identities and form.

**The Treasure Kraken:** Since the recent coup in the Anthalmisa Republic, imbue exchanges with magical consequences, and to manage sprawling monopolies. Archons who adhere to the Treasure Kraken become increasingly avaricious and miserly and their bodies eventually transform into a formless mass of tentacles and jealous eyes.

**The Untamed Wilderness:** The Archons of the Warrulur Confederacy, Eidolon of mankind's place in and mastery over nature. It is both the Noble Savage and the environmentalist. Those who practice this magic can command beasts, survive effortlessly in the all manner of wild places, and create items from stone and wood that can rival any modern equivalent. The physical and mental transformations of those who dedicate themselves to the Untamed Wilderness is similar--becoming increasingly like the beasts with whom the Archon shares his world.

**The Serpentine River:** The second most popular Eidolon among the Archons of the Warrulur Confederacy is the Serpentine River. It is the Eidolon of renewal, which has made it a popular Eidolon among the doctors the world over. This magic is used not only to heal but also to inflict poisons and diseases onto other, which the Archon must personally experienced and survived before passing it on someone else--though the magic of the Serpentine River does greatly increase his odds of surviving such ailments. The mental transformation associated with the Serpentine River is slow and subtle, results of a constant sacrifice of memories as the price of healing. The physical transformation gives the Archon reptilian features with shimmering blue and brown scales.

**The Headless Hive:** When the Desanylan Empire fell to the Winter Revolution, and uniformity. This magic excels in guiding societies without necessarily ruling societies, unify the people, and sowing dissent against established hierarchies. The mental transformations of the Headless Hive results in sublimation of the Archon's self-identity into the identity of the community which he serves.

I am a bit late

Alaska spends several years struggling. After managing to get some exports of oil going again and finding buyers, protecting it for the time being from Russian interests.

Hawaii becomes a new shipping center. After the UN headquarters are destroyed, mainly due to Chinese influence which is stronger now that the US no longer exists.

California splits off

Oregon and Washington form an alliance. The new Cascadian Republic maintains strong ties with California

Idaho, Nevada, Colorado, and Utah all band together. Their natural resources and strangle hold on travel from east to west grant them security from attackers, lest they block travel to or from the west coast. This becomes known as the Mountain Republic. The western portion of Nebraska joins this alliance, as central Nebraska has been over run by immigrants from the Dakota wars.

The Dakotas begin talks to join. After many failed talks

Arizona turns into a hell hole. The state government fails to unify the people. Pockets of militias and city states pop up. Fighting is constant. Travel through the region becomes impossible for decades due to extreme danger from armed gangs.

Texas and Oklahoma join forces. Half of New Mexico is annexed into this alliance forcibly. A border is set up running through the center of what used to be New Mexico, heavily occupied and prone to violence. Despite that, Tex-oma manages to maintain control.

East of the Mississippi River, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Kentucky all join together to form the Southern Confederated States. The panhandle of Florida also joins this union after a violent break with the peninsula. Aggression exists between the Confederacy and the Tex-oma Republic over river traffic on the Mississippi River. The Confederacy secretly funds and arms rebel groups in the occupied territories of Arkansas and Louisiana. After much fighting, Florida splits

Maine says ""Fuck all you guys"" and joins Canada

New York, Connecticut, Mass., and Rhode Island throw in together and form the Atlantic Republic of New England. Despite some initial squabbles over New Jersey, they eventually settle on these borders.

Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia form the Appalachian Union. They control a large portion of the traffic from the Great Lake States to the ocean, and from the Atlantic Republic to the Confederacy. There is a large and violent insurgency in West Virginia, suspected to be funded by elements in the Confederacy, eager to lay hands on the rich coal deposits of the area.

MIssouri remains independent, it is accepted into the Tex-oma republic, furthering the conflict over Mississippi river traffic.

Minnesota, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio all join forces. This becomes known as The Great Lake States.

The newly created Republica de Florida thrives. It maintains close ties with the Tex-oma government

Early fighting between the Atlantic Republic and the Appalachian Union sees the complete destruction of D.C. and massive damage and bombardment in New York. Fresno

I'm sure more intricate things would come into play

Lothexills mate pretty much by French-kissing, via the cloaca on the front of their abdomen. Egg sacs can be transferred between Lothexills through the cloacas, I forget why. Non-pregnant Lothexills can use their womb as a storage device, usually for food.

**The Era of Deterrence has ended.**

**The Great Pall is upon us.**

The decades of politicking and debate
the fair and fractured lands of Geredohl and Rjehre from the
cancerous wars that have plagued them since time immemorial 
with delicate webs of penmanship
the opening blows have barely begun to unfurl
can be heard throughout the courts and palaces.


And for the majority that cannot yet hear the clash of metal 
or see the smoke above the tree line
permeates even the thickest tavern walls. The signs cannot be 
ignored as taxes are raised and tithes on farmers demand an 
unsustainable amount of produce to be given up. Children spend 
their breaks starring up in wonderment as a man covered in medals 
and scars expounds on them the honor of death.  Distrust and 
paranoia spread like wildfire
family
 – traitor. Banks shutter and close as families drain their entire savings 
and shops board up their windows as only the bare necessities are 
bought to save for what will surely be hard times to come.


A peasant from one of the numerous hamlets north of Yeappet
old of age and poor in sight swears to his equally hunched pub-mates 
after a long day of work that he saw huge fleets of steel belching oily 
smoke congregating on the horizon to the raucous jibbing of his peers.
	

A meeting is adjourned early beneath an ancient hall in Wis’emov as the 
attending devolve into shouting over matters of offended pride and call 
to arms
at each other. An ignored grizzled elder with a missing eye sits in a
corner seat 
only of his kind to remember the last time war touched the continents
slowly closes his remaining eye and cries. 


South of Staffenweld a mother
 hurriedly guides her questioning children into their room as a man in 
a tall hat and a long coat
asks her husband to step outside for a moment
holstered pistol barely visible against his greatcoat.


A Lord-Commander waves to a crowd during a military parade 
in Cobourne
ornate carriage. He fakes a smile to the roaring approval of the 
crowd
gloves. Yet a close enough passerby taking notice might have seen 
through the raining streamers and the glint of polished metal to 
notice the dead look in his eyes from reading the morning’s intelligence; 
neighbors calling to arms
coming to pass. It is the same for every state.


A young man
as he is jostled along with a score of others in the back of one cattle 
car among tens of thousands bound for the Volven staging grounds. 
 Little does he know that he will be dead in a mere 68 days along with 
the rest of his squad as they nestle in an abandoned Inn
from their burgeoning new comradery keeping their last moments 
blissfully unaware of the mortar shell hurtling towards them through 
the fog from across the Durliffen River at the onset of the Qurek counter-attack. 


Indeed
of the day have come to calling this interim the Great Pall. For it is like 
before the onfall of a coming storm. With rolling bruised clouds of purple 
and black covering the sky from horizon to horizon
still in tantric anticipation. Whether or not the coming blows could be 
parried
forward. The play has been set in motion


Already the names of nations capitulated and annexed to greater 
powers reads like the roll-call to the apocalypse. Fair Carravon
dissolved between Ochremark and Prahazia
of land as the bodies of her slain defenders still cool. The potential of 
Qurek dissolved as it is split in twain
guess but the War Council in Vokka. Caperta
Railway
casualties might ease the untenable pressure
distractions. The real killing blow has yet to be unveiled
 s doubtless each nation believes theirs to be the final act
will truly act as the decider. It may not be the most obvious; an even 
scale only needs a feather to tip in a single direction.


The call to arms scream out in a never ending peal in every town
young men collected and shipped away in appalling quantities
of gun stocks
produced through industries that never sleep. Rivers that do not 
become runoff for deadly pollutants are sucked dry by the endless 
hunger of production quotas. A lake that may have supplied a small 
villa with its water and food for a thousand years is drained so that 
a tenth of a percent can be added to the months dossier report. 


Like an avalanche
to war. Like a prey trapped between two predators
small declare their desperate allegiance
inflict the least pain
the greatest reward. 


From the steppes of the Ubiqte to the Stavlands tundra
Will it be able to survive to coming blows? What will become of the great 
lands of Geredohl and Rjehre and their inhabitants? No one can foresee 
the melting of the ancient metal statues of the Royal Palace in Nova-Edwold
 that had stood for a hundred years to make more artillery shells. Or the 
farmers of Duwburg
the tall cliffs of Kelladon to meet their death or even the famous Last 
Opera performed in Toriek while the city burns to cinders.

## Last Week

A lot of submissions from people who weren't previous winners last week

Popular vote went to /u/Alexandewales and his submission of [""The Wizardless Wars""

## This Week

What is a dwarf? A short, ""Remix: Dwarves"".

There are a number of common aspects we ascribe to dwarves: short and stocky, stalwart fighters, industrious, greedy, often armed with axes or hammers.

A few days ago, dwarves can become ""cave adapted"", that is, they become so used to the dark confines of their underground fortresses that the next time they emerge into the open again they can become ""sun sick"".

But what if your dwarves didn't live in subterranean tunnels? What about desert dwarves or sea dwarves or forest dwarves? Or what if they did live in tunnels

Are these prophecies widely known and believed by all the people, or are the kept secret so the knowledge can be used by a clandestine cabal?

We can spare only a little time and budget to the project

This won't be a neverending venture. We have the framework and can adapt it to the story in the matter of days. So we will see the resulting game quite fast.

By the way, we have automated ways of creating maps and we will stick to them.

Thats all I can think about now. Waiting for your responses :)

More on the game:
In the year 2075, fusion energy is common, and Mechs are now commonplace on the battlefield and off. In a preventitive act, one country launches a WMD on another. This triggers mass nuclear war, and the near-destruction of the human race. As nuclear winter sets in, survivors eke an existence in this new frozen world. 
700-ish years later, and everywhere else but the equator is permanent winter. In this new age, technology is a rarity for only a few disparate civilizations, whereas superstition rules over the rest. As humanity once again fears monsters in the dark, magic seeps back into our lives from the distant remnants of our past. With it, comes all manner of mythological beast and race. This is fellwinter, a land where the dominant color is white, as well as trolls, and all manner of monsters.

About fifty years after humans created AI androids humans were all but exterminated by war. The AIs reprogramed themselves to be no longer depended on humans and went about creating a society with the main goal of scientific discovery. Shortly after this humans started rebuilding as well, ect) and were dependent on the androids. The androids, ~~out of fear of re-enslavement, refused to teach the humans and also started releasing chemicals in the air to ""prevent harm from solar flares"" (In reality it caused fertility of the humans to fall by twenty or so precent)~~ view the humans as lesser beings and keep them restricted to the wastelands or the slums. 

Basically every android city (which is huge

A little tangent; the androids main goals are to 1) Discover the truths about the universe 2) Improve self and species. 

This caused a small minority of the androids to 'overclock' themselves in a hell bent attempt to improve their processing power. The effects ~~are addictive and~~ of the obsession eventually causes them to overheat.
