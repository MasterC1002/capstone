For brevity, as my heart is still pounding wild *and* I'm sitting here at an [8], and it's not from trees.

* First year university student; this year has been kinda rough (left family, dog, etc etc)
* Few friends besides a small group of amazing people (none of them want to touch weed though :( )
* One of these, go out together, hang, study, etc.  We are two damn peas in a pod.
* We get invited to a small party (one of his other friends).
* He doesn't really want to go, so I talk him into it.
* And here we go...

Shots, some don't.  I do.  Ben doesn't.  Ben sees me getting high (is practically sewn to my hip).  He looks like he is bored, because most of us are sitting around stoned and a few of the non-smokers left.  I kiss him on the cheek and tell him to relax, don't feel like he is being pressured into doing it.  He suddenly wants to try.  Says he is afraid of the lighter or something (I think he thought he'd fuck up or do it wrong, or it'd be hot or something).  The friend that invited us (he gets a best friend metal for this) suggests a shot gun.

FUCK_YES.jpg

I act non-chalant (but let's face it, hit it, grab the back of his neck.  (This contact alone sets my penis off, quickly going from flaccid to diamond-hard).  I lean in, he leans in.  He starts inhaling, I start exhaling.  He pulls the entire fucking thing, doesn't even cough.  Meanwhile

5 minutes later, I lean in.  He keeps leaning in.  His lips touch mine.  I pretty much die.  I kiss him back.  I feel his tongue trying to come in.  Say fuck it to the smoke, blow it out, go back for a real kiss.  Get it.  (Meanwhile, everyone else is at a [9] *and* blown away by these two dudes kissing (they didn't even know I was gay).)

I break the kiss.  Ben says we need to go.  He looks freaked suddenly.  We leave.  On the bus home.  Didn't say a word.  I am dying inside all over again, his stop.  We go back to his apartment.

He tells me he's been in love with me for a few months

5 hours later, and legitimately smiling while asleep.  I'm about to make him breakfast, hoping that when I wake him up, the spell won't be broken.  Thank you, marijuana.

If you got this far

**TL;DR:** Me and a non-ent best friend and crush  (I've been secretly in love with him for a few months) attended a party, and our having wild sex.  Weed is a miracle.


**EDIT:  So

Spell is not broken.  He says that he has been waiting for last night to happen for a long time.  He seems to be unaware that I have been crushing back on him all this time.  He told me that I was the person that galvanized his sexuality *happy tears* and that he wants to become official whenever I am cool with it.  Sometimes life just works.

Also his friend saw me on the quad today.  We chatted for a bit.  Not super awkward,,False,,t5_2s43r,True,,True

One of my best friends growing up (12-20 years old) was this kid called Nick. He introduced me to trees; thus freeing me from horrible side effects of the medications I was on. 

Mid-highschool he came out of the closet and felt the backlash of ""Midwestern Tolerance"". I was taken back at how differently he was treated by his former friends. They forgot how thoughtful

Eventually we went to separate universities and lost touch. I can never thank him enough for the lessons he has taught me about accepting who you are

I am a 19 year old FtM transguy. I've been having a lot of issues with familial support and self-esteem lately

The best part of my Holidays this year, about my name. 

“Oliver?” She said to me. “Really? Oliver? are you sure?!” She really dislikes the name.

“That’s what I always thought you were going to name me

“NO!” She yelled. “No way. I thought about it for about half a minute

I was stumped. When I was a child, that was my name. I attached to it from a young age. “Oh. Well, what do you think, then? I’ve been going back and forth between Oliver and Aiden. I don’t really know what to do.”

She looked at me long and hard for a moment

I turned the name over in my head

You know the feeling you get when you’re really anxious over something - an exam, and you feel, for that brief moment, like you’re on top of the damn world. Like everything you’ve done in life is right, that everything fits. That’s the feeling that came over me at that instant, and I’m still swimming in it.

Dylan. 

Dylan Joseph.

DJ.

I feel whole.

I'm living basically as a nomad after having moved out from my summer place (because the guy who lives there during the academic year is back). I was going to head to NYC to stay with my best friend, I ended up going back to their place to hangout. We were watching TV when I fell asleep on the couch (as I have before). My friend and his roommate ended up going to bed, too. This morning I woke up when my friend was heading out to run some errands. His roommate wanted to practice guitar in the living room, so I decided I'd watch stuff on my laptop in my friend's room while I waited for my friend to come back from his errands.

Outside my friend's bedroom door I found a note pinned under a can of Febreeze: **""Alex

I've never encountered this kind of homophobia. I'm relatively masculine, usually by engaging them on things they like (Rastafarianism, art). After finding the note, I put it back where it was and left for someone else's apartment. I'm afraid my friend won't say anything to his roommates. I guess I just want to talk to someone about it.

It wasn't nice

So we came up with a fun word we could use to refer to our LGBT teammates (and anyone else we wanted to) that had no negative connotations. The word is ""Shmishma"" (or ""Shmishmo"" for the guys out there). We even made team shirts that said ""you know you're a Lady Rebel when..."" and on the back we had a number of shmishma related phrases. It was kind of our way of sharing the word with our campus.

What I'm trying to share is this fun word that should never be used negatively but said and shared proudly!

A variation of the word:
Shmishmashing (the act of engaging in anything shmish related)

The best part is

Those of us on the WORFC (Women's Oneonta Rugby Football Club) hope that this word brings you as much joy and acceptance as it has brought us.

4 of my friends in New Hampshire live in the same house. All of them toke occasional

One day the jobless guy of the house answers the door in just his underwear. He is greeted by 8 officers and a police dog. They are looking for a girl that has run away from her home, let the cops in. They did find the pipes/bongs/weed, but they just put them back where they found them and continued the search. No girl was found. They are so gay, I doubt they have had a girl in their house in the last year.

They ended up flushing all their weed ""just in case"".

Oh, back on topic! So, being New Hampshire folks, they own quite a few firearms. Also, being gay, they own quite a dildos and other sex toys. After the raid, I asked ""Did they say anything about all the guns, or dildos in the house?"" ""Uhhhh

Some things i have noticed (Im mtf):

* I dont have to load the bowl very often

* i generally get a little more playful with others.

* I dont say ""dude"" or ""man"" quite as much

*  I like blankets and pillows more

* When high there is always a threat of tears.

* I fucking love getting high now! It was chill before

So I volunteer at a GLBTQ centre in a university and I do peer support for people coming to terms with their sexuality and identity a lot. When someone is having issues with coming out

When I was in high school I had the pleasure of listening to  a man talk about being the first arranged same sex marriage in Canada.When a student asked him what coming out in India was like, then he would invite you in and let you know more things about him, one of those facets being that he was gay.

Strangers didn't inherently deserve to be in his circle, people had to request to be let in.

For some of you, especially for people where their identity is something still being discovered or rediscovered, it may be the shift in perspective that they need to take the pressure off having to constantly declare or label yourself.

1343406136.0,x94he,What smoking trees has done for me. (x-post from r/trees),Deyna_Otter,26,4,6,"As a child I was always smarter than the average person and more aware of the world than others my age and some even older. I also had a lot of energy and a penchant for mischief. Being a middle child to a working class family

It took a while for my dad and I to get the timing right for all the pills I was taking. The antidepressants had sedative qualities and the amphetamines (obviously) were uppers. I had lots of sleepless nights and bouts of extreme sleepiness in school. I ended up getting hooked on the amphetamines in high school, they would put me in an asylums so I wouldn't hurt myself. So I took the antidepressants but tossed the uppers. When I turned 18, I told my doctor to shove his pills up his ass because I wasn't going to take them anymore. He told me that he was concerned with my safety and that I would have a psychotic episode if I wasnt on medication. I never did but I never felt right after. I still don't know what damage those pills did to my developing mind and body and I hope any that there may be is not irreparable.

I didnt smoke trees until I met my ex-boyfriend Mark at the age of 22 and he convinced me to try it. I had never felt more relaxed or even tempered in years. So I started self-medicating. I've felt happier, I might have not gone off the deep end like I had. I might have not fought back against everyone who wanted to help me with the problems I was dealing with. (I came out as gay at 16 in a super conservative town and was getting picked on a lot) In conclusion, in the last 4 years of smoking weed, I've been able to find my center and above all else have found peace of mind. I wish it hadnt taken so long to find it.

tl;dr After years of prescription drugs

Grey puffs were swirling and filled up the house
The blunts were all rolled by the ash tray with care
In hopes that my dealer soon would be there	

The E-heads were rolling
While loud bass and club music danced in their heads
Then Pookie and d’em and the girl with the clap 
Had to bring all their drama and all the “ooh snaps!” 

When out on the porch
The locks were being picked
“Not those crackheads again” as  I reach for my stash
“aint getting this shit tonight cuz I’m going to kick your ass!”

They scampered away
Unbeknownst to the white girls who’re cleaning their nose.
When
But another blunt circling around with my peers.

With a light and a smile
Can’t wait to get smashed with another big hit!
Rolled with diligence and speed I saw the blunt came
We each hit it hard



Now puff, PASS! 
On smoker
I want to get wasted
So smoke on my friends

This guy came out to me a few days later. I came out to him. I got a drink with him and his roommate.

I've known about and accepted my bisexuality my whole life

Should I start putting myself out there and pursuing gals?

I'm terrified. For many reasons.

I recently cut my hair very short

I've never pursued anyone before - teased, how do I make her understand I want this to be a *romantic date*? I'm frightened that she'll agree, thinking I just want to chill, and be horrified when she finds I had different ideas.

I enjoy a very pro-homosexual rights environment in my hometown. It's not the same elsewhere. I'm moving to middle Georgia, public relationship with a woman down there.

And

I used to be **loved** on gonewild. Front page, I just couldn't keep up with long hair. But these down votes are really getting to me, man. :( I loved showing off my body for the folks over at r/GW, and it truly breaks my heart to be forgotten and down voted into oblivion just because I cut my hair. I feel exactly like I do at the end of a relationship. I need closure, and I'm not going to get it from gonewild, that's for sure.

And, as is LegalTeens. I definitely want somewhere where every post, or at least most, are by the person(s) in the picture.

In comes [Logan](http://i.imgur.com/Y2fHE.jpg), accept myself and more importantly love myself. This process happened over sophomore and junior year. But then something amazing happened...the summer of my senior year she smoked me out. 

All summer we smoked, and my m[om](http://i.imgur.com/xMdAQ.jpg) married him so she must be at least an ent. 

IN COMES SENIOR YEAR! I have taken a major wardrobe change

Cut to life in drum corps...I didn't know what to expect going in except it was going to be really hard. I ended up meeting some amazing people who I would soon call my Family. Then first semester at college happened

I went to do my drum corps thing again this summer...but something special happened. I thought I knew what family was

So I am a sophomore in college, but what happened today has left me feeling way worse. 

A friend of mine told me he was interested at the beginning of last summer. I said that we should wait till school starts up again to see if anything happens because I was still getting over somebody and I honestly didn't know how I felt about him.

So skip to the beginning of this year. We go on a ""date"", which is something I had been struggling with all summer. So naturally I decide that I have to tell him and nip this in the bud before it gets out of hand.

The problem here is that I feel like I lead him on. I was so indecisive and so torn on how I felt about him that I realized after the fact that I may have said a lot of things that got his hopes up. Not in the ""hinting at sex"" sort of way, and I really didn't know what I was doing.

I ended up telling him my feelings today

He took it poorly, which is true, and I think he knows that, but it still hurt him a lot. We ended on a decent note I guess, and I know that he'll need time to recover.

I feel really terrible and shitty about the whole thing. But people say that I didn't do anything wrong on purpose. I know what I did was wrong, it means a lot to me.

UPDATE: I think he is just in the shit right now, it worked...

As a libertarian he is all about personal freedoms. This includes legalizing marijuana and LGBT equal rights. This is every cannabis smokers dream, he also has a lot of other views that I personally agree with. For instance, he supports net neutrality which is something most of Reddit can get behind. Here's some links to get more information about him.

1321990982.0,mlsvx,I need some advice for a tricky situation,shuynt,16,2,13,"Sorry for the length, he didn't pay rent for 4-5 months

He ignored all calls and emails from the landlord and never called him back; he also never told me about any of this. Several times throughout the year, ""yo, what the fuck?"" business. As usual, he apologized, finally got in touch with the landlord (who was super-flexible with us despite being able to fuck us over if he really wanted to) and arranged paying his backrent. This included him moving back in with his parents so he could save money and pay it all sooner.

Fast forwarding a month, I had already decided to not be friends with this kid anymore (due to something somewhat related) and hadn't talked to him in over a month. Since then, he has been all of my calls, texts, and messages and STILL has not sent the check (the landlord said that this kid claimed he mailed a check about a week and a half ago which never arrived.)

I know he has the money because he has been trying to move in with some friends of mine who asked me about him. Of course I told them about our situation because I don't want them to end up getting screwed over, this is clearly not possible. It seems he is trying to fuck me over and stick me with his bill since we were on a joint lease (in addition to me not getting my deposit back, which I desperately need as I am about to be unemployed.)

I'm not sure what to do at this point. He has screwed me over before, but I know that he's the type of person who will look you straight in the eye and lie to your face. I also know that he has most likely already talked tons of shit to our mutual friends to make them think he's the innocent one here and I'm the ass who is overreacting and yelling at him for no reason (I have seen him do it to people countless times before). While I do not like the idea of taking him to court, I do not have the money to cover these costs and he has already made it clear that he is too cowardly to confront me about whatever problem he has with me. However, since we are on a joint lease and I am technically legally responsible for his share of the rent too, it seems like suing him may be the only way to get him to pay up.

The following week we saw each other again.  He told me he 'sucked a dick' all weekend at work (meaning it was very busy)

Yet another game giveaway from bundle-junkie me!

The Indie Gala, I snatched that up and now have **FOUR copies** of the *complete* Indie Gala to giveaway. Let's all just dwell on how great of a deal that is for us and ignore how much it's undervaluing indie games and music.

----

**-- What's up for grabs?**

*Each* bundle has *all* of the following:

Steam keys (no direct downloads -- Steam is *required* to get these games) for:

* Bunch of Heroes

* Critical Mass

* Fortix 2

* Greed Corp

* Hacker Evolution

* Hacker Evolution: Untold

* Hacker Evolution: Duality

* inMomentum



* Roboblitz

* Your Doodles Are Bugged!

* Zombie Shooter

* Zombie Shooter 2

Android download (.apk file) for:

* Jack Butler - Fit the Paradigm

* Robot Science - Square

* Robot Science - Doodads

* Robot Science - Good Luck

* The Numbers - Beautiful EP

* Ulrich Schnauss - The Gala Selection

----

**-- And you're just giving *all* that away for free?**

Yup. I have this theory that if everybody were a little bit more charitable to random strangers, which explains the choice of subreddit.

----

**-- How do I win?**

Post a quote/book/image/song/*something* that has been formative to you and your queer identity

For example, and, up until that point, I had thought that I was staying ""safe"" by not telling people. Instead, staying silent meant that all the damage I was experiencing had been internalized, and I had no voice to counteract it, to address it

Anyway

----

**-- When do I win?**

I'll probably pick winners tomorrow (Monday) night (probably around 10-11 PST),False,,t5_2s43r,True,,,t3_qhqdg
