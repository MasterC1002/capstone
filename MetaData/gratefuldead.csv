I am 13. Before any of ya'll jump to conclusions; i'm not posting this to say ""Oh hey i'm 13 I listen to old music so you should like me cause i'm cool."" No. I just want to post here in honor of my grandfather. He's probably the biggest Grateful Dead fan I know


I grew up with the ""The best of Grateful Dead, I remember each and every one of them. He rarely wore anything else. When I was 8 I saw a magnet on his fridge that had colorful dancing skeletons on it, saying ""Grateful Dead"" at the top. I grew up with this man, walking the short path to his house every morning so we could walk down to the boat dock &amp; swim.

He talks on the radio shows a lot. I remember him driving me, hearing his voice and the radio and him smiling all the way. ""Tales from the Golden Road"" on facebook uploaded a picture of him with his many dogs, saying ""Get well soon Brian!"" Ya'll are probably wondering why i'm posting this.

He's in the hospital at the moment. Been in there for almost a week. Don't ask me why, talking day by day. One man said the ONLY reason he listens to that show is to hear My grandfather's stories, talking about his (many) Dead Head Dogs and events he's been through, he's overjoyed to talk about them, and people are overjoyed to listen to them.

I just want you all to give a thought or two for him, I don't judge. This man impacts many people. With his words, stories, laughs, his bitching about nothing, everyone loves him. 

He's got maybe 8 to 10 Grateful Dead stickers on his door

I just hope ya'll can spare some time to send him some good vibes

I love you. And i'm proud to be your granddaughter. 

Get well soon my Dead-Head GrandDad.

Wikipedia says: ""David Gans, California, is an American musician, songwriter, and music journalist. He is a guitarist, and is known for incisive, literate songwriting. He is also noted for his music loop work, and the host of the weekly syndicated radio show The Grateful Dead Hour.""

What Wikipedia doesn't say is David is the guy who talked Phil out of retirement

Barry Smolin, David Gans croons like the warmest invitation, like a soulful bear hug, but with a sardonic edge at times and the unmistakably wry gleam of the trickster. Swift with allusions and wordplay yet always heartfelt and real, David doesn't need to hide behind irony. He's not afraid to say 'I love you' and mean it. 'Looking for a melody to sing a simple song... I find my inspiration where it's been all along,' he sings as a kind of invocation of the muse, a dedication to straightforward communication and the revelation of the familiar.""

A perfect phrase
This exchange appeared in Hunter's mailbag on 8/6/96:

Date: Jul 25 1996 12:36 AM EDT
From: cebass@pacbell.net (Charles E. Bass)
Dear Robert

After reading through a number of Mailbags posted at your web site

Between your evocative, thank you, thank you, thank you.

I sat down the other day and figured out the chord changes to Mission in the Rain. My wife (who is not a deadhead) especially likes that song. Maybe it is because we live in San Francisco and there is a reference to the Mission. When I play it she always starts dancing.

Robert, for you, does a box of rain represent. I am not asking for the meaning of the song, or for you to explain the song to me -- I spent plenty of time on my own doing that. I am just terribly curious how you came to choose that image.

Well, it feels funny and self-conscious trying to put onto ""paper.""

Regards
Charlie Bass

Charlie
well, and mostly you'd need to have my mind to understand even approximately what I had in it. By ""box of rain,"" I meant the world we live on, but ""ball"" of rain didn't have the right ring to my ear, so box it became, and I don't know who put it there.

&gt;Dead shows were engines of catharsis and ritual initiation as much as they were good-time parties and rock concerts. The overall structure of a show, the descent into darkness and final resolution into joy. This was entirely intentional on the band's part, even if it became occasionally perfunctory in later years.

&gt;The essence of the Grateful Dead lyrical theme is the bittersweet. The rose and the skull; love and death; joy and tragic loss; dancing in the face of sorrow, not denying it or turning away from the pain. The band members all experienced personal tragedy and loss as young people, and around the time the pivot towards a deeper lyrical stance was made, they were under assault on all emotional fronts. Some of them lost family members. Altamont, and all it represented, happened; and with it the final death of the 60s dream, and though the band had moved on from that vision already

&gt;And yet they didn't despair. They kept on truckin' on. They asked, if they knew the way, they would take us home...but they didn't, so were were on our own.
I think this is a fairly profound and spiritually mature way to look at life. Death is real, because we're alive now, and we're all here, and it feels right.

&gt;The essence of acid is the dissolution of barriers, the true songs, they can help us get to that place of acceptance, when they hit us in a vulnerable moment. And everything about the shows was structured to create that moment, that still fleeting moment when the note hung clear in the air, framed by strange fingers of light, and we could finally see the truth of life for what it is, but without despair.

I decided to go look through my father's CD cabinet -- hundreds of albums. I was standing there thinking to myself, and never gets old"". As soon as that thought was complete my eyes locked onto the one and only Dead disc in the whole cabinet. Skull fuck.

I pulled it out, and the thought that popped into my brain was, ""I should have been listening to this for my entire life"".

I was hooked. I downloaded the Fillmore West 1969 box set and realized that I had finally found something so complex that I couldn't listen to all of it at once. Before that I could listen to an album two or three times and have it memorized note for note. Not so with this band.

I dove right in. Reading about the Dead, and that was a bummer. I wished they would, so I could hear them play live. Shortly after that The Dead 2009 tour was announced. I was fucking PSYCHED. Got tickets to three shows -- 4/18 and 4/19 in Worcester, and the next weekend in Hartford.

Shortly before those shows I met Greg, and had tickets to the same shows. We went, and we had a blast.

The first time I walked onto the lot was as mystical as the first time I heard the music. I have always been a weird guy, I knew I had found home. Not my house, but my real home. It just clicked. There was no denying it. I was where I was supposed to be. Right place, right time.

I saw those shows, he sent me the info. He turned into one of my best friends, and when Furthur started we went to the Oakdale show in December of 09.

I didn't have a ticket, but DEAD center. That show was fucking awesome. It is still one of my favorite Furthur shows.

From there I kept seeing Shakedown, and, of course, listening to The Grateful Dead. I just love it. I love everything about this whole thing. I was seriously depressed when I first found the Dead, and my life is totally different now. I love the life I live, and a large part of that is thanks to the Dead and the people I have met through the music.

I wouldn't give it up for the world.

We practice in an old house owned by the college just across the street from the music building. As we are all walking out and finishing up rehearsal I hear really loud music coming from a garage right next to us. I'm walking past and then I hear someone singing ""Loser""!! At this point I get really excited and me and my trombone player were like ""dude lets see if they want to jam??!"". 

So we stood outside in the freezing cold for another 10 minutes waiting for them to finish (because they were so loud they couldn't even hear us pounding on the door) and finally I muster up the courage and give a few healthy knocks... and this old washed up looking hippy with a beard opens then door. I complimented them on their sound and asked if they would like to jam with some horn players

So we jammed out for like an hour with 5 total strangers and played Eyes

Also they had this garage decorated with a bunch of dead posters and jerry posters... it was so cool!

What has always gotten me about the Dead is that they have this something that other bands lack. It's just something that I can feel when I listen to their music, even through computer speakers. When I listen to certain songs, it's like I've just reached musical Nirvana (not the band, mind you, but the place) and everything is perfect. The lyrics, the music, they just hit me and bring me to the verge of tears, on my bed

Three girls wait in a foreign dominion / ride in the whale belly / fade away in the moonlight / sink beneath the waters / to the coral sands below

it's like these words satisfy my soul in a way I didn't know it needed to be, and everything.

All the heads were dosed - just trippin' to space.
The joints were all rolled with precision and care
With hopes that St. Stephen soon would be there.

The freaks were nestled all stoned in their beds
While visions of Johanna danced in their heads.
With me in my poncho and her in my hand
Just dyin to hear ""Uncle John's Band.""

When out from the stage there arose such a clatter
I sprang to my feet to see what was the matter.
O' way to the stadium I flew with my stash
I kicked down the gate - it fell with a crash.

the light from the orb
Blinded me like I was Born cross Eyed.
And what to my red glossy eyes should appear
A shadowed figure

No,
Could it be Mickey
He started to sing and the sound from his lips
Assured me at once that he was Captain Trips!

His eyes how they twinkled
I exclaimed in excitement
I couldn't believe it - just Jerry and Me
""Play something"" I said. ""Play Sugaree.""

The Fat man jammed - he was on a roll
With his sweet songs
Jerry spoke once
""Gotta go now

Perhaps I made it to shows where they were not gelling(sp?) or just weren't ON those nights. It just didn't seem to feel like their experiences. What can we who missed out do? Who picked up the baton? I haven't been able to find anyone who even care's to these days. Was it a product of the times? Is this a phenomenon that we will never experience?

The band seems to take pleasure in having songs with ambiguous meanings or spirit
Sure

As an example, NY (10/31/79). There were 18 songs that night (one of the reasons I fucking love the Dead). After eliminating the (5) traditional songs and covers (unless I missed some), I'm left with: 

*China Cat Sunflower

*Cassidy 

*Loser

*Althea

*Lost Sailor

*Saint of Circumstance

*Shakedown Street

*Passenger 

*Ramble on Rose

*Estimated Prophet

*Eyes of the World

*Wharf Rat 

*Truckin'

Of those 13 songs, and Ramble on Rose is also ambiguous. Of the 11 left, two are positive in my opinion (Eyes and Cassidy). The rest are a mixture of darkness and light.

1322515386.0,msg9t,Intro to Torrenting for deadheads,MrCompletely,40,0,35,"This tutorial assumes you know very little about torrenting. Note that torrenting itself is legal

I also assume you can hear the difference between lossy files (mp3) and lossless. That's the point after all. If you can't hear the difference there's no hope for ya.

**Abstract overview:** when you download files via a torrent

**So first you need a torrent app and some bandwidth.** 

There are many free torrent apps. I have used utorrent on Windows for years and haven't found anything I like better: http://www.utorrent.com/downloads

I used Transmission for Mac for a bit. Right now I don't torrent on my mac so I don't know if there's anything better.

Setting up the torrent app to work right can be a bit of a pain. Once you get it set up it works easily though. One thing I like about utorrent is that it has a nice setup wizard that actually seems to work. There's lots of support forums and stuff for various torrent apps so I'm not gonna get into that here.

**OK so now you have a torrent app set up

A tracker is a website where people post and download torrent links. The easiest, Phish, Furthur, and all other legally traded sources is: http://bt.etree.org/

Another really great tracker is Workingman's Tracker. You don't need an invite to join, as opposed to looking back for specific shows.

http://www.shnflac.net/index.php is another membership only tracker that has is GD/Jerry centric

Demonoid is an easy place to download official releases

**Regardless of which tracker you use** you just click on the DL link to grab the "".torrent"" file

The first time you do this you'll have to show the OS which program to use to open the file. 

*Important distinction that seems to confuse a lot of people* - the .torrent file you download from the tracker IS NOT THE MUSIC. The music is in the ""fileset."" The fileset includes some number of FLAC or SHN files that can be converted to music, with the music in it, will start downloading.

Once the fileset starts downloading, and how many other people are downloading at the same time. Heavily seeded shows, the ones that are most recent on all the above trackers, generally pull very very fast.

**So now you have some FLAC or SHN files** 

First of all

On windows I like Trader's Little Helper http://tlh.easytree.org/

On Mac I used to use xACT but I hear that XLD is more the way to go these days.

Basically you drop the FLAC or SHN files on the converter app and tell it where to put the output (usually WAV files by default).

Then you import the resulting files into iTunes or whatever program you use

**I know all the above sounds like a pain in the ass**, it's well worth the time getting the hang of it. Once you get used to it it's no problem.

1369403350.0,1eyxj8,The story of the Betty Boards.,cowboyhaze,48,8,17,"Taken from www.panicfreaks.org:

I was bored earlier this week, Vol. 3. I've still got a few pages to go, but I figured that I'd throw this on the board before the weekend so the daytime ezaddicts could take a read.  


In 1987, after failing to keep up on monthly payments, they were put up for auction. The rest, as you are about to read, is history. Dougal Donaldson, one of the more passionate and through tape traders on the scene, now relays his perspective on his role in this grand series of events:

Dougal Donaldson: This was the summer of 1986. At this point I had been taping seriously since 1978 and had amassed a collection of more than 1100 tapes on cassette. I had gotten almost everything I wanted that was available at that time and was kind of stuck in an in-between space in terms of taping. There wasn’t really anything in the cassette world I wanted, specifically for that purpose. I had already met a couple of the front-of-board digital tapers through a mutual friend. I was hoping if I could get digital clones of whatever they had, then perhaps I could parlay that into gaining access to some of the legendary collections that I knew existed in the mecca of Grateful Dead-land. Unfortunately, even that did not work.

As it came to pass, my friend Brent told me about someone he knew named Stephen who was looking for a digital processor with which to transfer some old reel-to-reel tapes to digital. To me, it sounded like a perfect match, so I had Brent tell his friend to give me a call. When Stephen called me, he didn’t seem at all interested in the reel-to-reel tapes I had. He only wanted to know if I was willing to part with my digital processor for a couple of months in exchange for receiving copies of whatever tapes he transferred to digital. He claimed that they were all excellent sound-boards and that absolutely nobody had them, but he was very mysterious when I questioned him about their source. When I asked him what shows were on these tapes, he listed a few of the dates. Tapes of some of the dates he mentioned, ranked among the worst-sounding but best-played shows I had on tape. Others, were widely available in excellent quality at the time. I was skeptical that this guy really had some great secret stash of tapes. After all

I agreed to meet with him anyway, and could leave with my equipment at any time if I so desired. The meeting took place on a Saturday morning in the parking lot of the Whole Earth Access store in San Rafael. I was to go there, buy tapes, and look for a long-haired guy in a green Datsun. I bought a few boxes of blank beta hi-fi tapes and sat in my car waiting. Pretty soon a black BMW pulled up and out stepped none other than Bob Menke, at that time the most legendary of Bay Area tapers. He had been pointed out to me a couple of times at shows while his reputation was being greatly expounded upon. I had mixed feelings about this, as Bob had not been very friendly on the one occasion when we had been introduced, nor did he have a very positive reputation among tapers that I knew. However, it must be more significant than I had originally thought. Finally, in their case, thick curly black hair tied back in a ponytail

They gave a quick hello and started in on explaining the plan. We were to follow them for the two-and –a-half-hour drive to their house. Part of the journey was on a deeply rutted dirt road, about two hours into the drive into the backcountry of the north coast, we turned off onto a dirt road that was, indeed, well rutted. It was a beautiful, sunny California day as we drove through oak groves and small vineyards. Along the way, we passed the occasional farmhouse, and over another bridge made from an old flatcar dropped into the creek. My initial trepidation was beginning to creep back when we came to a stop. The couple wanted to switch their vehicle into four-wheel drive to get through the next section. I looked ahead and saw a very muddy dip followed by a steep, it struck me that the couple leading us on this merry chase must have known they had found whom they were looking for, and darted up the hill

We all made ourselves comfortable in the living room portion of the small, knickknacks everywhere, and had a casual feel to it, lots of stuff but not messy. The house, I later found out, was powered by some solar cells supplemented with a gasoline generator. The couple brought out three large boxes filled with reel-to-reel tapes, and placed them at our feet. While I picked through them, our hosts proceeded with their story.

It seems that there was a storage locker rented by one Betty Cantor-Jackson, after sending numerous notices to her and receiving no response, told her to retrieve the items out of the locker and close her account. Again, there was no response, so the owner did what is usually done in these situations: he placed an ad in the local newspaper and auctioned off the contents of the locker. Most of what was auctioned included furniture, clothing, kitchen utensils, among these items were hundreds of tapes. Many of the tapes were brand-new sealed 7” and 10” reels and take-up reels. Most of the others were cassettes, and thrown in with them would be a frying pan and a couple of tapes. After the first few rounds of bidding, both cassettes and reel-to-reels. No one knows who that person was or where they went. This was the fate of most of the tapes sold at the auction. Since many of the tapes were thrown into various lots and since several people were able to get the lots

With the possible exception of the last party, when there were floods. Those lockers did not escape that fate. There was a flight case full of tapes that also was full of standing water. The tape boxes had disintegrated and were unreadable. Some of the reels had unraveled and looked like spaghetti, while everything was covered in mold and smelled awful. This pile of tapes was left in a nearby dumpster.

Most of the bidders were people who make it their living to attend these auctions and resell the stuff at flea markets. However, they invited them to come over and look at the tapes. It actually took about six months for our hosts to make it over to their house, but when they finally did and tried to play the tapes, they were only able to get what sounded like one channel playing out of both speakers. When our hosts heard their story, they determined that these must be a batch of soundboard tapes recorded on a two-track tape deck.",,False,t5_2qpnj,True

**Fall '72 is one of the alltime best runs of Grateful Dead music.** I personally consider it the second best extended stretch of performances, or degraded. However some serious work is being done to correct this as much as possible and a handful of these upgraded sources are linked below. 

Houston [11.18](http://bt.etree.org/details.php?id=560687) and [11.19.72](http://bt.etree.org/details.php?id=561657)

The 18th is a fresh CM transfer of a set that features one of the alltime best performances of Playin' in the Band

The 19th is a careful remaster of a brilliant show that has previously been plagued by serious flaws throughout. Charlie's work has made this source much more than listenable though still not an A grade source. The performance features:

 * sharp playing on the ""small"" songs like BIODTL
 * prototypical versions of gems like Brid Song and Black Throated
 * relative rarities like Box and Tomorrow is Forever
 * Dark Star &gt; WRS prelude &gt; Half-Step

**Even if you don't get anything else I'd say these two Houston filesets are MUST HEAR material for all heads**

Nashville 10.21.72 - available [with](http://bt.etree.org/details.php?id=560171) and [without](http://bt.etree.org/details.php?id=560170) noise reduction. These are alternate versions of what's otherwise the same remaster of a formerly unlistenable set. I slightly prefer the NR version at least in headphones. The set itself is a skullfucker of the first order.

San Antonio [11.26.72 partial](http://bt.etree.org/details.php?id=560439) - another nice upgrade version of a fantastic Dark Star &gt; Bobby McGee that has long circulated in hard-to-listen-to form. Apparently Charlie is working on an upgrade to the whole show

And finally one I have not listened to yet - a remaster of [10.18.72 Fox Theater](http://bt.etree.org/details.php?id=561661) - a show that would unquestionably be an official release if the master wasn't so flawed. Looking forward to checking this one out over the weekend

I'm not gonna give my opinion until other people have spoken their piece. But I'm probly gonna retire this username with the new year &amp; wanted to have the discussion before I do that.

If you haven't experienced it

But there is an experience that many of us have had, it also seems like everyone has a different perspective on it.

Some people call it a group mind.

Some people talk about an ""energy feedback loop"" between the crowd and the band.

Some think it is an intrusion of the Divine

I've heard Kabalistic, and radically reductionist-scientific interpretations of the experience.

Some people think it's just a hallucination

Some people clearly feel it's best left out of the analytical/verbal sphere

Do you know what I mean?

How do you see it?

What roles do you think the band and crowd play? Does a ""leader"" figure such as Garcia matter? Do they play an active role

Have you experienced it outside the Grateful Dead context? If so

Do you only experience it on psychedelics?

Do you have anything to say on this topic at all?
