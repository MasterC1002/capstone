1337544131.0,twdk7,Greetings fellow computer techs. I've put together a Google Site you may find useful.,waytootired,123,20,85,"___
**EDIT**: Someone posted this over at [Technibble](http://www.technibble.com/forums/showthread.php?t=37788) where the author of [D7](http://www.foolishit.com/) pretty much immediately noticed the similarities between the two sites - most notably the topic and theme.

I started building up the site after [answering](http://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/trdvq/it_software_toolbox/c4p2s68) [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/trdvq/it_software_toolbox/) and was checking back with it - adding anything new that cropped up. D7 [cropped](http://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/trdvq/it_software_toolbox/c4p6oxn) up there and it was also submitted through my site form twice - so I added it in. I did pick up on the similarities and made a note to change the theme (a popular Google provided sites theme) when I was done getting most of the suggestions in.

The Internet hivemind can be extremely judgemental in cases of plagiarism

A frequently posted question here and on other related subreddits regards what tools of the trade are out there. There's often a load of good suggestions mixed in with some ""use the search"" comments.

What I have done is start collating everything on a Google Site. It is nowhere near complete but I've got the basics down. I'd love it if you could make some suggestions on what else to include (there's a form on-site) as well as let me know about anything else that could improve the site overall.

There are a lot of lists like this out there

So without further ado: [The Fix List](http://sites.google.com/site/thefixlist/)

The combination of Windows XP machines with SP2 and McAfee running this PCI compliant scan to detect vulnerabilities often finds SP2 a vulnerability and requires the independent contractor to update to SP3.  However, something happens to cause the internet to break.

I am a systems technician for a small locally owned IT company, as well as our business clients.

A client of ours had the moneypak virus on their PC,  ran all his malware removal tools. The threat was removed, however it decided to do some more damage first. Back at the shop I was tasked to diagnose issue, and implement a solution. I slaved the hard drive to my tech PC and noticed that the file system was now RAW, and attempts at getting to the drive again seemed to be impossible without formatting. 

I replaced the drive into the downed PC, I can mount the partition. In this case however, I was not lucky. 

So looking more in the recovery tools, I still had time to mess around with TestDisk. 

I don't need to go through the steps because google is better at that then I am, and best of all (with a lot of frustrated tinkering) was able to repair the file system, setting it back to NTFS, all without needing to format.

**Memory**- This is the desk where the worker gets things done. Having more workspace, without constantly have to dig through the filing cabinet. If the user doesn't get it, ask them to recall working on a research project on a massive library table, and then trying to accomplish the same feat on a folding auditorium desk. *That's what 256MB of RAM with Windows XP feels like ;)* Sure, you can take notes... But that's about it. Single/Dual/n-channel memory can be explained using wrap-around / multi-surface desks. Memory speed can be explained easily by attributing this to the speed the worker can read the information on the desk, SDR/DDR/DDR2/etc can be explained using multiples of reading speed, ie ""DDR2 reads twice as fast as DDR"". Bad memory (spotty, not posting) is essentially a hole on the desk, it falls over and dumps all the work onto the ground.

**Storage/Hard Drive**- This is the workers filing cabinet. When the worker is low on desktop space, which is MUCH slower to find information and read it than finding and reading the information on the worker's desk. The pagefile is essentially just information organized like it is on the desk, but it's inside the filing cabinet. The worker knows it's there, so it's a little bit faster than accessing any old information from the filing cabinet (loading programs from pagefile: launching from the HDD), but still not as fast as having it already out. Having a failing HDD is like a filing cabinet, with all the information on rails and folders getting jammed, and sometimes when the cabinet is opened, papers slip out

I’ve squeezed in many other things to this analogy… But I don’t use this analogy unless starting with the &lt;this is the difference between the processor, but instead of the worker calling out sick, he tries to do his work, sometime’s he’s able… He could be under instruction by somebody else, he may be feverish and doing things poorly, messing things up (corrupting files). The virus might just be a camera installed overhead, monitoring all which is done

**My second analogy is a quick one** – *“I just had my computer in a week ago, constipated, etc…”* This issue occurs at least monthly – I run a small business, I can concentrate on systems easily, and there is little work which gets handed from worker to worker. I make sure all jobs are done from start to finish by one worker, as much as necessary. I explain the problem to pacify the customer this way, “While there is a chance something was missed, and some are so new that our tools and scanners can’t even recognize them all the time to eradicate them, that new tire gets a flat. Sure, it’s all blowing smoke until they leave

Does anybody else have some nice analogies they use with customers?

**TL:DRs at the bottom**
****
**Story 1:** This one happened about 6 years ago when I was doing a malware removal for a customer I no longer do business with. Nothing bad happened, one of the customer's relatives started talking to me. 

He was a relatively young male, asking how business was, what I did for fun, etc. At some point, for reasons entirely unknown to me, the conversion shifted to where he started to talked about how he used to deal cocaine. He talked about how he acquired it, and where he sold it. I sat there thinking, but I needed to get the job done

As if things couldn't get any more WTF,000. He said that he had robbed the person at gun point, and shot them in the leg when they did not comply with his initial orders. He knew they would not report the incident because of their illegal status.  

Now I'm like, I decided to go on and finish. At no point in the conversation did the individual seem threatening, otherwise I would have left immediately. He even offered to hook me up at one of the clubs he frequented. I politely declined, finished removing the malware, and left post haste. 
****
**Story 2:** This one happened about 3 years ago. I was doing a malware removal for a soldier. He leaves while I'm working because he has errands to run. While I'm working, comes in to see what I'm doing. 

I tell her that I'm removing the malware from her husband's computer. She then asks where it might have come from. I give her the usual spiel about downloading music, etc. She says, knowing her husband, that it most likely came from adult content. 

This is where things start to get weird. People usually just say, ""Why do guys like to watch porn?"". ""*Oh god.*"" I thought, ""*How am I supposed to deal with this?*"". I lied. I told her that I didn't watch it myself, and had no idea why other guys did it. Next, she said that her husband was not paying as much attention to her anymore, and that she had recently had a mirror installed on the ceiling for her husband's birthday so that they could watch themselves having sex. ""*TMI!*"" I thought.

I already new that I was on Weird Ave.
that. I just told her that I was sorry to hear that

I've been working mainly managed services help desk for &lt;50 companies (tier 1 and 2)  but my last 8 month contract was deskside support.  Something I thought in the beginning I'd love doing!

Now 7 years into IT and I'm completely burnt out after my last deskside support gig.  My manager there was a huge asshole and I didn't fit in with the guys who had been there for years. 

Now I'm back on the desk until my next contract


I don't really like it because of how unorganized every company I seem to go to is.

Everything is extremely unorganized


I'm honestly just tired of doing this job and I leave work every day with no motivation to sit down and study for more certs

However


Anyone in a similar spot or deal with this?

I'm thinking of taking time away from IT and revisiting in 6 months to see if i'm motivated enough to try to get my CCNA... but I hear its hard as heck to even get a networking gig if all you have is your CCNA and no experience.

Here's a basic rundown of what I want to accomplish:

* A download database containing archive files of drivers by PC model. Double Driver is perfect for this. Everything you need for the machine in one package. As the collection grows, 7, 8 drivers in 32 and 64 bit. Linux, too, if there's adequate demand.

* A wiki split into 3 basic categories: HIDs

* No account required to download. Period. That crap is annoying.

* A forum to make requests

All of this would be community driven. That's a hard one on its own

* Costs. I'm broke.

* Website hosting

* Reliable download hosting.

* How to design the site. Use a freely available CMS with download db, or hire/convince someone to custom build one for the project.

Got a call for a nonworking Dell wireless keyboard on a Dell All-in-One PC from a customer I'll call Sarah. I was told by Sarah that it was working earlier that day and it was not working now. When I arrived on the scene the conversation went something like this:

**Deeperkyo**: Have you tried replacing the batteries?

Sarah: Yes.

**Deeperkyo**: Have you tried re-syncing the keyboard?

Sarah: Yes. It's still didn't work. 

**Deeperkyo**: Have you tried to remove and reinsert the wireless dongle? 

Sarah: What's that?

**Deeperkyo**: It's the piece that goes into your computer that allows your keyboard to communicate with the computer. 

Sarah: Oh that! Yeah! (Points to ****Logitech Unifying dongle****.) It was working earlier today with this. I was changing desks and moved my computer and bent the other one. I went to get a replacement at the store and the man told me that they didn't carry Dell

**Deeperkyo**: (*But...That's impossible*) Ma'am

Sarah: It was working this morning!

**Deeperkyo**: Ma'am

Sarah: No. I just plugged it in and the keyboard and moused worked. Now it doesn't.

**Deeperkyo**: Ma'am I honestly have no idea how you got that to work as they're made by different companies. You'll have to call Dell and get them to send you a new dongle. (Writes down part number of broken dongle.) Just call them and give them the part number

Sarah: Okay. I'll call them. Thanks for your help. I guess I just have to call them and get a new one.

**Deeperkyo**: No problem. Call me if you need anything else. (*Please don't call me.*)

**TL;DR**: Unifying dongles bring the technology of all the world's wireless devices together. :)

Bonus Story - **No Dial Tone; No Problem**

On the same call

**Deeperkyo**: I need to check the line to see if there's a dial tone. Do you have a regular phone I can use?

Sarah: Yes. Here's one.

**Deeperkyo**: (Plugs phone in. *Dead Silence*) Um. Ma'am. There's no dial tone. There needs to be a dial tone for the fax to send.

Sarah: It was working earlier today!

**Deeperkyo**: (*Super facepalm*) I'll need to find a working line for this to work. (Checks xfinity box. Line 2

Barbara, has been using the same PC for the last 15 years, and it's finally given up the ghost.  She lives on her own and this is her only link to the world at this point, other than her daughter who visits about once a week.

We want to get her a new PC, though, is someone local to her to set it up for her and get her back up and running.  It's a pretty daunting leap from Windows 95 to Windows 7, and we need someone who'll be patient and sympathetic.  She's pretty savvy and an internet aficionado, but at 85 obviously stuff doesn't come quite as quickly.

Reddit, but they wanted $190 just to have a look, and that's 1/2 of what a computer is worth!

Here's a few pictures of her current setup:

Since my job right now is mostly spent being Technical Support I figured maybe I could go in that direction of IT.  I know I'm good at being patient with people who have no knowledge of technology (Try helping a little old lady through connecting a touch screen mobile device to her home network when she doesn't know her router password or what a router is... or how to type... all over the phone mind you.)

I'm a 20 year old male residing in New York. I'm currently going to a health &amp; tech institute that provides Information Technology courses. I'm going full time and have already completed a Linux course (discussed how to manage a Linux based system, we're mostly at the moment learning the GUI, how to troubleshoot the OS at a fairly basic and somewhat advanced level, etc. In Network+, we're learning the seven OSI layers, cable types, how to physically set up a network, cable management, patch panels

I've been with computers most of my life and am very experienced in Crash Dump analysis and debugging for Vista/7 based systems. I decided that I wanted to make computers a bigger part of my life, if I graduate, I get three certs paid for by the school granted I pass the exams and then I suppose I go and find a job? I'm sort of foggy on a lot of stuff, so I would appreciate any tips or help.

 These are the included courses I am taking/will take:


   * CompTIA A+
   * Windows 7
   * CompTIA Network +
   * Windows Server 2008
   * Microsoft SQL Server 2008
   * Microsoft Exchange Server 2010
   * Apple Certified Support Professional
   * Microsoft SharePoint 2010
   * ‎Cisco Certified Entry Network Technician
   * ‎Cisco Certified Network Associate
   * Security+
   * Virtualization and Cloud Computing
   * Certified Wireless Technology Specialist

At the end, off of the top of my head, these are the three certs they are paying for: CompTIA A+, CompTIA Network+, CompTIA Security+. To my knowledge, and from what I have read, these certs are entry level certs and can usually get your 'foot right in the door'. Is this the truth, and how would I go about finding one in the first place? What are some good places?

I'm just wondering what's at the end of the tunnel for me with certifications like that. Something I am also very worried about, I decided to enroll into this program. So, in reality, all I have to my name will be those certifications, a diploma from the school itself, and a GED. Is that enough even for entry level positions, and in the future, MSCE... etc)?

I'll try to keep this to the point as best I can.  I have purchased 9 Crucial M4 SSDs from Amazon over the last 6 months.  We've steadily replaced all of our traditional HDDs with the 256GB M4.  Performance is great

We have had 3 of those 9 drives fail prematurely (I'd say 3 of 9 within 6 months is a bit of an issue).  All drives shipped with what was the latest firmware at that time.  So the original customers who had the really nasty bug of drive failing after so many hours of use

All of the failed drives (thus far), respectively.  TRIM support is enabled, defrag is disabled, and we've been through all the standard SSD best-practices.

The pattern seems to be related to power, shit hits the fan.

Whether its NTFS corruption, it seems that when the power runs out, it's all over.  Again, I hate to speculate, but that's been our experience thus far.  Their latest firmware update [reflects improvements](http://i.imgur.com/ilEsQ.png) if sudden power loss is experienced.

Crucial, is to [wait-to-receive](http://i.imgur.com/TMk41.png) - i.e. we pull all the drives out, ship them to Crucial, and wait for them to send out replacement, refurbished drives.

They didn't offer to put a hold on a CC to ship one out.

This might just be my own experience

Just thought I'd share my experience and possibly save someone some time.

Now I know a lot more then common PC user and I'm going to take up some classes in computer networking. As far as field experiences go I'm working for 6 months at a computer repair shop but left because the owner was was cheap and didn't want to buy legitimate software and or hardware to fix pc's and if he did buy hardware it was mostly second hand hardware that he didn't try out before he bought it. So now I'm just doing door to door work so I can build up a list of references as well. Though I would really like to get into some sort of helpdesk for now.

I'm assuming he's selling the parts online (especially the HDDs due to price increase). How should i/we go about denying this type of fraud? We're already out the money for his first two because Asus won't let us return it to them without the ooginal hardware intact. Should we send out an email to other stores in the area that he could try this at? Should we fix his current laptop even though he's replaced the parts and there's viruses/malware in the OS?

I guess I'm the sort of person whom Satan decided to single out as a personal target.  I can put a computer together just fine.  I can keep my installation running smoothly for a long time.  Hell

Give me an RJ-45 cable however

I have every trouble in the world dealing with my office network.  I'm the only person to whom this happens.  For the longest time, SonicWALL would work two or three times after install, and then would never be able to connect anywhere again.  I installed a virtual machine only to run on SonicWALL, with the same results.  The tech ended up making a clone of his own VM and giving this one to me.  What do you know: SonicWALL took the shit after barely a day.  My tech is utterly convinced I did something to the VM, some sort of manipulation for the thing to stop working on my machine.  But I hadn't.  I had connected once to verify it worked, then shut down the VM and turned it on the next day to go fetch a file on a customer's server.

I am the only one who needs to input his password everytime I connect to the sources repository, I connected.  I had good reason to be surprised: for the past year, my machine had been the only one to fail to connect to the wireless network and no one could understand why.

At home

* 1: Linksys Wireless - Couldn't wireless its way through a gyproc wall.
* 2: Linksys 4-port - Randomly entered into a panic mode and refused any and all connections
* 3: D-Link DI-624 Wireless - Crashed and self-rebooted at such breakneck speed that I was banned from a chatroom for join-flooding at 2:00 AM while I was asleep.
* 4: Inexq 4-port - Modifying the virtual server parameters caused the router to immediately crash.
* 5: Homemade m0n0wall box - Both NICs physically failed after a week.
* 6: Bell Sympatico router-modem combo - Oftentimes lost connection for no apparent reason
* 7: Linksys-Cisco WRT54GL - Supposedly the holy grail of routers.  My fucking ass.  One of the physical ports became inoperative

I keep hearing people going ""router (x) sucks balls, D-Link, Belkin, Buffalo, you name it.  Everyone I know has used the same router practically all their life, for several years without failure.  I go through a router a year on average.  To this day I have never been able to find one that works perfectly.  There is always a glitch, some way to instacrash it and it happens to be on the feature I need at the moment.

I don't even listen when people suggest devices to me anymore.  I know that whatever I grab, a bunch of them were claimed as ""the last router I will ever need, period.""  They oftentimes were the worst performers of the bunch, becoming flat out inoperative after a few months.  The best ones, go figure why, were the spare shitboxes I borrowed from friends as a quick fix and which then proceeded to last for an unexpectedly long time until I got fed up with whatever feature I was needing on them and didn't work and never had worked.

I don't even try to do what the office techs suggest anymore.  I simply invite them to sit at my workstation and have at it.  So far

I need to lock down the computers so that they don't get all messed up by the users (you know how public PCs go)

I'm trying to meet a few criteria in completing this work. First, I'd like to do the same thing to both computers so that I can more or less treat both computers the same instead of going with one solution on each. As to technical details, we need people to be able to run only basic office-type software (calculator, Office Suite, internet browser, etc.), and we also want to block them from visiting undesirable websites. 

I was looking at doing Deep Freeze and Win Select for locking down computer access and setting a fallback image for when people mess things up, and K9 is around $20... $200+ is probably a little steep for their software budget. If that's really the best way of accomplishing this, I can probably convince them to do it, but I thought I'd check with you guys first. 

What are your favorite ways of locking down PCs designated for public access?

The L1 is a day shift

Normally this would be a no brainer. More money is nice. However, but in this job I got I am also dealing with things I have not dealt with for a while. Both positions prefer Linux experience, but not required. The L2 position also states, while Linux is not required, it is preferred and even a cert. in Linux is preferred. As well as other certs. The only cert. I have is an MCP. Though I probably have the experience to match other certs.

I have never dealt with Linux in a support role

To give you an idea of my experience. I have almost seven years of technical support experience for various companies. I used to work for Dell in Gold Technical support/Pro Support (Their highest, I am unsure). Really the only thing I don't know much about for these jobs is Linux.

My main concern is going into the L2 position and not knowing everything they expect me to know. Is this a valid concern seeing that they already said I have the job if I want it? Do you think I can learn/pick up on what I need to know as time goes by?

Personally I have had terrible experiences with Pearson. In my (lack of?) dealings with Pearson's Customer and Technical support it seems their various subsidiaries have almost no ability to communicate with each other. 

I've never been able to get a response from their publisher's customer support concerning product details. 

After 2 months I have given up on Pearson's MyITCertificationLabs tech support ever being able to create an account for me.

PearsonVUE's website lost my first exam appointment. To which PearsonVUE's customer support stated the only solution was for me to reschedule and wait another month. 

I was looking forward to using a different testing service for future certifications. Then I noticed that announcement from CompTIA :/ 

I just finished writing CompTIA my thoughts on this in the form of a customer service ticket. Afterward I became curious if anyone else has had problems with Pearson and/or if anyone else thinks it is a bad move for CompTIA to give a monopoly in servicing their exams to any one company?

I got down to the heatsink, got the dust off it, cleaned off the heatsink, CPU, and GPU, and applied Arctic Silver 5 to the CPU and GPU. I put it back together and booted it up.
 
I then began to notice that even though I could hear the fan turning, I was even more astonished to find that the GPU was going up to 103C. Needless to say I had to go back in.

At first I thought I had not put enough thermal compound on. Once I got back down to the heatsink, I noticed that I had not looked inside the heatsink fan. Once I took the fan apart, I noticed a big clump of dust. ""That'll do it."" I thought to myself. I then put everything back together.

There is a column titled ""Date Closed/Not Closed""  You can either put the date the account closed or type in ""Not Closing"" if the account did not close.

I have a cell that totals up all the amounts of the accounts and shows the dollar totals for all the accounts we have.

I need to make it so if I type in ""Not Closing"" into the date column instead of typing the date it will take the amount from that row and subtract it from the Totals cell.

I also need another formula where if you type in the date in the ""Date Closed/Not Closed"" it will sum up the totals of the rows with the amounts with a date when it was closed.

I am thinking that its obviously and IF function IF a date is entered then sum it in this cell or IF a date is not entered then you subtract it from this cell but don't add it to this cell.

My sister put me in touch with a co-worker and friend of hers who was having trouble with a thumb drive (Cruzer). After speaking she said that she thought that one of the tabs was broken on the USB connector. I told her I had soldered these devices before and would take a look. She asked how much and I told her since she was a teacher and a friend of the family I would do it for $30 (dirt cheap IMHO).

I finally got the drive a week late (mail problems I assume) and it's shattered. She apparently took a screwdriver to the casing and pulled it apart. There was no broken tabs either though. Inspected it under magnification and saw no burn marks or damage to the circuitry so I plugged it in. Nothing. Piggybacked the connector and it was recognized but no driver and no data. As of this time it no longer even is recognized by the PC and I have been tinkering with it for four hours. 

Already messaged her with an update that it wasn't looking good but I am about to give up for the night. 

Question is, but I did spend four hours trying everything I told her I would for the fee. With that said, if it was full price and a regular client, I wouldn't charge for a failed attempt.

I got a call back from an IT staffing agency about a job as a helpdesk level 1 for a PBX phone-service company. My primary duty would be supporting end users with that service, and they say they are stopping their search with me for now and just need the VP to sign off on an official offer. 

However, and I just got back from an in person interview. They say they have kind of a drawn out interview process to try to get to know the candidate.. I'm guessing there is going to be at least one more interview, if not two. I think I did really well in that interview too, and I feel like there is more opportunity for advancement in this place.

The problem is, but they strongly hinted that I would be offered a full time position if I did a decent job, which I'm pretty sure I would. The timetable for this job interview/acceptance process is going to be a lot faster than company B. 

Company B is a straight full time position and offers full benefits after 90 days

I am a recent graduate with a bach. in Software dev. At the moment I have an internship going (unpaid :(   ) so I figured a good way to get some money on the side (afternoons/weekend jobs) would be to start up a simple little home pc shop.

I have done small to medium repairs on my own and family computers for free over the years

* Home network setup
* Virus/maleware removal
* Custom builds
* Data Transfer
* Software installation (eh...we have a large group of elderly people here)
* Recommend with what budget you have what desktop/laptop to buy

After I get some initial funds from doing a few jobs

I figured a flat rate for most jobs would work good, and then the rest after completion. If I did get into repair, Id probably charge 30-40 an hour to undercut the local (hugely overpriced) store that has 2-3 employees working there. I applied back there when I was 19 looking for a summer job, back then it was....nasty to say the least. 

Flyers will be put in the 2-3 grocery stores within the 2-3 towns around here. Will be ordering business cards and setting up with Google Voice. Anything else you guys can think of that I am missing that I could include/need to do? Hopefully this is in the correct subreddit. Thanks for your time!

I have seen this error caused by DNS before. A quick ipconfig /all showed me this. 
       IP Address. . . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.1.19
       Subnet Mask . . . . . . . . . . : 255.255.255.0
       Default Gateway . . . . . . . : 192.168.1.254

       DNS Servers . . . . . . . . . . : 207.155.184.72
				   207.173.119.72
				     
Even though the workstation is set to DHCP from the SBS server at 192.168.1.2 it is using the wrong DNS (it should be using the SBS server). Preformed a release and renew

I got called back two days later for the same issue. Ipconfig showed the same results as before. I double check my DHCP server to make sure its configured to hand out the right DNS. I also verify that the workstation in question has an active lease. Then I haul out process explorer and process monitor along with my rootkit tools

This acts very much like a rogue DHCP server on my network

* 1.	The windows DHCP server is running and working correctly. It would have shut down if it detected another DHCP server on the same network. 
* 2.	The workstation has an active lease showing on the windows DHCP server.
* 3.	IPconfig lists the DHCP server clearly as 192.168.1.2

Right ? Well no. Completely wrong as it turns out. Logging into the Linksys E300 router I discover that DHCP is in fact enabled with the DNS servers I encountered. After questioning the staff I am told that a technician for the ISP was upgrading their service recently and changed settings in the router (apparently enabling DHCP in the process). 

**tl:dr** XP workstation accepting and using only the DNS settings from a rogue DHCP server even though ipconfig reported it was using the proper domain controllers DHCP server. 

I am unsure what lessons to take away from this

* Am I better waiting until after I have the A+ because i will then be 'certified'?

* Is there anything I can do to be qualified to work on computers and laptops without voiding the warrenty or be able to product 'engineers reports' for laptops which have developed faults under warrenty?

***Moderators***


I'll be needing two moderators with the following qualifications:

* 
Must be doing some kind of technician work in a professional capacity.

* 
Will be available at least 2 times a week to check on the subreddit.

* 
Have a overall professional candor about them. (I don't mind mods having a discussion about their methods, but I want to keep the overall tone of this sub civil/professional).

Optional weighted qualifications:

* 
Knowledge of how to edit the style sheet for a subreddit.
* 
Web design knowledge

I may even add a third mod simply for the two above qualifications.

Since we are not that large yet
All of this will be taken into account when selecting a mod. 

Please message me via ""message the moderators"" with your request to become a mod. 
I will need some proof that you are a professional before I elevate you to mod status. I will let you know what you will need once you message me. 
I will also use other criteria to chose candidates that I will not display here. Thanks in advance to anyone who applies for wanting to help this community.


***Tone***


I would like this subreddit to have a mostly civil/professional tone. All are welcome
Everyone's been great so far

As explained below
Maninly, solutions, and experiences, and for us to be able to have fun and learn from one another.

***Computertechs Page***

I do plan on personalizing this subreddit. Since I'm more of a hardware/software guy than a web guy

I've read tons about people reflowing using an oven...everything from gaming consoles to hp and dell laptop motherboards.  [this](http://www.computerrepairtips.net/how-to-reflow-a-laptop-motherboard/) is an example of just such an article.   

What do you folks think

Is it worth it for a 2.5ghz core 2 duo and 3GB ram

Any tips or advice, etc (I'm HP certified but work on both HP and dell fairly confidently) but this ""oven"" method sounds totally crazy.  That said, I'm really curious to see if it can work!",,False,,t5_2soz7,,http://www.reddit.com/r/computertechs/comments/qv3hn/ghettoreflow_a_gpu_using_an_oven_can_it_really/

I was just hired for my first formal IT job. I'm going to be sort of a jack-of-all-trades IT guy for a company and I was wondering if anyone had any pointers/tips?

Just anything you wish you'd known when you started. Really anything is acceptable; like I said

Thanks!
