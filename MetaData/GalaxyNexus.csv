**1. Get the Galaxy Nexus ready**

Go to Settings-&gt;System-&gt;Developer Options and enable ""USB debugging"". [Picture](http://i.imgur.com/RVBGh.png)

**1a. Install the Android SDK** - (OPTIONAL - You don't need this

Now install the Android SDK, and the Tools. You certainly don't need all of those but I erred on the side of caution.

**2. Setup your computer**

Download [Galaxy Nexus Toolkit](http://bit.ly/uUfnGX) (v6.2 at time of writing) and once it installs open it and choose whichever phone you have (to check go to Settings-&gt;System-&gt;[About Phone](http://i.imgur.com/LIcxE.jpg) for your Android Version

Then choose ""1. Install/Uninstall Galaxy Nexus Drivers on your PC."" (by pressing 1 and enter). Pick your OS and wait for it to finish installing. [Picture](http://i.imgur.com/agY1J.png)

**3. Backup Phone**

You can probably skip this step if you just got your phone

Now ""2. Backup and Restore your Phone"" Follow the on screen instructions in the toolkit and phone to fully backup your phone.

**4. Unlock Bootloader/Root/Custom Recovery**

Once your phone is fully backed up reboot it into Fastboot (You do this by holding down the volume up AND volume down and the power button while turning it on, you can safely ignore the Downloading...). 

Check to make sure the Toolkit recognizes you are in Fastboot in the Main menu (refresh the menu

**4a. Recovery**

If you already rooted your phone like me reboot into Fastboot but choose ""5. Rename Recovery Restore Files""

You may want to stop after this step. At this point you have not made any radical changes to the phone

**4b. ALTERNATE METHOD**

Instead of using the Toolkit you can instead use the Android SDK and ADB to unlock the bootloader

**5. ROM and Kernel**

(Note: If you want to be EXTRA careful, ROM, Gapps, Radios, anything you're flashing)

**CAUTION** Make sure you get a ROM and kernel that are compatible. You either need a CDMA/LTE ""Toro"" or GSM/HSPA ""Maguro"" ROM. Just be sure to download the proper ROM/kernel.

Download the ROM and kernel of your choosing

Reboot into the Fastboot Mode and use the volume buttons to navigate to Recovery Mode and then use the power button to boot into Recovery. [TWRP looks like this](http://i.imgur.com/rN3Vb.jpg)

Now choose ""Wipe"". To be safe I do a Factory Reset and wipe the Dalvik Cache

You now have a custom ROM and Kernel!

Note: If it really doesn't seem to be working

**5a. Gapps**

When you put on a custom ROM you did wipe everything on there and due to legal reasons

Included apps: Google Play, Voice Search, Setup, Search Bar, Gallery, Backip, One Time Initializer (mostly crucial behind the scenes apps)

Not Included: Gmail, Navigation, Street View, Books, Movies, Earth, Goggles, Drive

**5b. Restore Apps**

Note: You'll probably need to reenable USB Debugging as in the first step again now that you've wiped the system.

If you backed up the phone in the Toolkit

**5c. Kernel Tweaks**

To make your life easier

**6. Radios**

Now my Verizon phone that never got updated radios even if the custom ROM did give it 4.0.4. Download the latest radios onto your phone in the same place you put your ROM/kernel ([VZW](http://bit.ly/Np30Ph) and [GSM](http://bit.ly/HoeVvf)). Then flash them as you did the ROM and kernel

To check what radios you have go to Settings-&gt;System-&gt;[About Phone](http://i.imgur.com/LIcxE.jpg) again and look at the ""Baseband version"". Compare what's there to what the versions are that you can download.

And just to wrap it all up, leanKernel, and AOKP M5.

**7. Bootscreen**

If you're like me, rather drag and drop your desired bootanimation.zip into the /data/local directory in the zip file. Delete the readmes and flash it onto the phone like you did the ROM/kernel.

---

**ALTERNATE METHODS**

I did not personally use this method but in the interest of presenting alternatives

Repeat steps 1 and 2 as given.

[**3. Unlock Bootloader

---

**Revert to Stock**

**CAUTION** This will wipe EVERYTHING

Sometimes you need to go back to stock, selling, whatever. There are four things you must do, reinstall stock ROM, reflash stock recovery, unroot, and lock the bootloader. Download and flash [the stock ROM for your device](http://bit.ly/JvTq9k) (same as the ROM in step 5, in the main menu of the Toolkit choose ""11. ReLock your Bootloader"" and follow the on screen instructions. Once finished you now have a stock GNexus again!

---

Also for the CPU Governors (Settings-&gt;System-&gt;Performance)

Please give me any feedback, pretty sure I don't need to wipe as much as I did, but I preferred to be safe.

* Once downloaded

* Be sure to record the destination folder

   * Example: Mine is in [**c:\android\android-sdk**](http://i.imgur.com/M5pEl.jpg)

* Once installed

* Once the SDK opens,**"" and ""**Android SDK Platform-tools**](http://i.imgur.com/sSYns.jpg)""

* Install these packages (they are the only ones necessary for rooting/unrooting)

* Once the packages have finished installing

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

**PART 2: Gathering the Required Files**

* [**Download JB-SuperSU.zip**](http://www.2shared.com/file/J5xZ8Y9U/JB-SuperSU.html)

* [**Download ClockworkMod Touch Recovery 6.0.1.0**](http://www.clockworkmod.com/rommanager)

   * Scroll down to your device (Google Galaxy Nexus) and your specific version (For example: Toro for the Verizon Galaxy Nexus).  **Be sure that you are choosing the Touch Recovery** (It's in the third column).

* Once both of these files are downloaded

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

**PART 3: Unlock Your Phone**

**----THIS WIPES EVERYTHING ON YOUR PHONE----**

**----THIS WILL ALSO VOID YOUR WARRANTY

* Turn on USB Debugging (Settings - Developer Options - USB Debugging)

* Connect your phone to the computer via USB

* Open a command prompt window (click ""Start button"" and type ""cmd"" in the search bar)

* Set the path to the platform-tools folder in the command prompt

   * For example: Mine is [**cd c:\android\android-sdk\platform-tools**](http://i.imgur.com/q38qN.jpg)

* **ALTERNATE (EASIER) METHOD FOR OPENING THE COMMAND PROMPT**

   * Open your platform-tools folder (C:\android\android-sdk\platform-tools)

   * Inside the folder

   * A dialog box will popup

* Check the ADB connection status by typing [**adb devices**](http://i.imgur.com/dpZBo.jpg) into the command prompt and press enter

   * If a serial number is displayed

* Type ""**[adb reboot bootloader](http://i.imgur.com/cN7Fo.jpg)**"" into the command prompt and press enter

   * This reboots the phone into ""fastboot"" (Big green Android guy with the green word ""Start"" at the top

* Type ""**[fastboot oem unlock](http://i.imgur.com/ey43n.jpg)**"" into the command prompt and press enter (If a FAILED message pops up like in the picture

   * You will then be prompted on your phone on whether or not to unlock the bootloader (it also mentions that it may void your warranty).

   * Click yes if you want to continue (**Volume Up/Down** to highlight and **Power** to select)

   * Once you’re back at the screen with the big green “Start

**Please note that it will take a while for your phone to reboot

**DO NOT CLOSE THE COMMAND PROMPT**

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

**PART 4: Pushing the SuperSU File to Your Phone**

* Turn USB Debugging back on (Settings/Developer Options/USB Debugging)

* In the command prompt

**ALTERNATIVE:**

* If you do not wish to use the ADB Push method

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

**PART 5: Loading Custom Recovery (See warning at the bottom of step 5)**

* In the command prompt

* Once the phone has booted to the bootloader screen

   * Everything after ""fastboot flash recovery"" depends on what recovery you downloaded.  This is the latest version of ClockworkMod Touch for the Verizon Galaxy Nexus.

* You now have custom recovery!

* Stay at the bootloader screen (Big Green ""Start"" at the top)

**WARNING**

Installing a custom recovery will prevent you from receiving OTA (over the air) updates (like us Verizon users know what those are

* Once you're at the the fastboot screen (big green ""Start"")  **DO NOT** do type the ""fastboot flash recovery recovery-clockword-touch-6.0.1.0-toro.img""

* In the command prompt

* This will boot the custom recovery one time and allow you to install the JB-SuperSU.zip

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

**PART 6: Flashing the SuperSU file**

* At the bootloader screen

* Press the power button to enter Recovery Mode

* Tap ""**install zip from sdcard**""

* Tap ""**choose zip from sdcard**""

* Tap ""**jb-supersu.zip**""

* Tap ""**Yes - Install jb-supersu.zip**""

*  Once it finishes installing

* Tap ""**reboot system now**""

   * **NOTE:** If you get a notice saying ""disable flash recovery

* Your phone will reboot

* Once your phone is back on

* Once the app opens

* Press continue and it will say Installation Success once it's finished

**YOU ARE NOW ROOTED AND READY TO START FLASHING CUSTOM ROMS!**

______________________________________________________________________________________________

**EDIT 1:** Everything that is done here (including unlocking the bootloader) is reversible.  I will try to make a similar tutorial on how to unroot and relock your bootloader via ADB.

Here is the guide!

Here are all of the files needed.

Click ""Go to the video or file for free"" and download.. enjoy everyone!

I will be taking a break now as I have just spend almost 4 hours putting this together. Sorry for any spelling mistakes.

I will check periodically to answer any of your questions and I will also be at work from 11PM until 5 AM

And for those wondering the ""pie chart"" on the wallpaper just compliments the buttons on the bottom and is not actually clickable to my understanding. I have not figured a way to place icons correctly around the circle to do it.

One more thing

Good luck!

EDIT 3 : if the icon for the weather UCCW is not showing up please let me know

EDIT 4:

Just in case here is my whol UCCW folder icons and widget backups included for both weather and clock

http://180upload.com/ms89py5a89de/UltimateCustomClockWidget.zip.html

EDIT 5: Please use the new Minimilastic Text clock backup as it fixes the minutes showing up as ""10:5"" to ""10:05""

I had uploaded the old one and forgot to update it

http://180upload.com/4oyiojxn2bkk/New_mintext.zip.html

Known ""bugs?"" - The UCCW widgets sometimes turn into a [blue block](http://i.imgur.com/nDpc6.png) with UCCW

Also, but they should move back up to regular place when you back out of the notification bar.

1. Samsung Accessory Support cannot confirm or deny whether or not the docks for the GSM Galaxy Nexus will work with the VZW Galaxy Nexus.

2. They have not heard many direct requests for these types of docks from VZW Galaxy Nexus owners.

3. Samsung often will not produce certain accessories for a phone unless it believes that there is a demand to be met.


Apparently

Send them an email: [https://contactus.samsung.com/customer/contactus/formmail/mail/MailQuestionProduct.jsp?SITE_ID=1](https://contactus.samsung.com/customer/contactus/formmail/mail/MailQuestionProduct.jsp?SITE_ID=1)

-or-

Call their Accessory department: (800) 757-0280

**Talking Points**

* Will a Desktop Stand and/or Vehicle Navigation Mount that supports 3-pin charging ever be released for the Galaxy Nexus i515?

* Accessories similar to these are already available for preorder for the Galaxy Nexus i9250

* The Vehicle Navigation Mount displayed on the Samsung and Verizon websites are nothing but glorified phone holders and do nothing to power the device.

* The docks currently being offered for the i515 force the over-usage of the USB port

* Why exactly aren't the docks for the i9250 compatible with the i515?

* Why are the contacts even on the side of the phone if nothing will ever be compatible with them?

Do your best


Thank You

Find out more about this package

Changelog: 

    * **Not compatible with 4.1.x.**
    * Installs Photosphere and Picasa sync on Mako (Nexus 4), all variants).
        * Does not include Grouper (Nexus 7) because it does not have a rear camera.
        * The GalleryGoogle.apk's for each are different
        * Overrides custom ROM camera features on all three due to replacing the AOSP camera/gallery APK.
    * ThinkFree and Microbes live wallpaper removed to save space.
    * All APKs updated to 4.2.0 versions
    * Still allows sync between AOSP calendar and Google Calendar.
    * Does not include non-NEON libraries
    * /system/etc/g.prop updated:
        * Users on 4.1 will **not** receive GooManager update notifications to 4.2.
        * Users on any past or third-party GApps packages and 4.2.x will '''not''' be recommended the proper package in GooManager when tapping on ""Download gapps packages"" then selecting to ""Download latest google apps"".
        * GooManager recognizes 20121130 (and future 4.2.x packages) as a new platform (''jb42'' instead of ''jb'')

[GooManager](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.s0up.goomanager) ~~users should receive an update notification within 12 hours (by default) or by opening the app and selecting ""Check for updates"". If you want to turn the notification off

EDIT: After talking it over, and hacking the APK to work on all devices is very much illegal for us to edit and distribute. Sorry!

EDIT2 (Noon PST 11/28): I'm uploading the new build now. It's got the fixes to install Picasa Sync and Photosphere on Galaxy Nexus (all variants) and Nexus 4. The separate Picasa Sync and Photosphere package for non-Nexus devices is also uploading. I'll have them up tonight at the latest!

EDIT3 (17:00 PST 11/28): We've pulled down the current pack because too many people on 4.1 are flashing it and getting bootloops, the awesome lead dev of GooManager, to see if we can have it not notify for those on 4.1. We're also hoping to fix the package to have proper libs for non-NEON devices like the XOOM. I personally apologize for the CF this release has been. We thought that we'd found all the bugs, but it looks like we overlooked a few.

1335383303.0,ss9la,Dirty Flashing: What it is and is not. Let's set the record straight.,Thracks,85,18,32,"I've seen considerable confusion popping up lately regarding whether or not you should wipe between builds of AOKP

The reality is that you probably *don't* have to wipe between builds, first.

A ""dirty flash"" refers to the process of flashing a new version of your ROM over the top of the one you have

1. Wipe Data/Factory Reset: This option erases all data on the device. Every application, all the data files generated by *every* app on the system will persist through an upgrade. This includes the data files generated by core system apps, like the phone dialer, the Android UI, its option menus and core features. Remember, *everything* you do on Android is an application that generates data! **NOTE:** The storage you see when you connect to USB will not be erased. 

2. Wipe Cache: Every application on the system, and are generated dynamically. These cache files help Android load and run faster. When changing ROMs or updating to a new version of a ROM, you should *always* wipe the cache partition, or you're gonna have a bad time: Force closes, boot loops and sluggish performance are just some of the perils that await you.

3. Wipe Dalvik Cache: Android executes programs inside of software system called the ""Dalvik Virtual Machine."" The DVM interprets and runs APK files for Android. Dalvik maintains its own cache to again improve performance for your device by offering faster app loading and execution. The Dalvik Cache is again unique to the current installation you are running

Now that you know what these options do

1. Users often don't pay attention to specific installation instructions. Making sure no prior OS is loaded is the easiest way to ensure that a dev's ROM is installed correctly. 

2. Users have significantly altered core UI frameworks with mods, or new information in the status bar. When these mods are installed, the data these essential frameworks generate no longer match the structure the stock frameworks you're flashing are expecting. The result is FCs, reboot loops and sundry other issues. The easiest solution for ROM devs is to tell people to wipe.

3. Far more rarely than the above two scenarios

4. The user has backed up all sorts of system APKs with Titanium Backup, you probably shouldn't be backing it up!

Before I get to the conclusion, Bluetooth pairings, contacts and other harmless-but-important data. Then, once in recovery, you should **always make a Nandroid backup** just in case something goes to shit. You never know, something might. You won't know if you *really* needed to wipe without trying.

So

For starters: never use the ROM Manager application to do ROM stuff. It's unreliable. Reboot to recovery and work from that interface.

Now, and diligently wipe cache+dalvik cache before flashing build 35, it's likely going to work just fine. Remember to also flash GAPPS and your custom kernel, if you were using one.

Yours truly has done an in-place upgrade (""dirty flash"") of every AOKP version since build 28. That's right: from 28 to M4, my SGN continues to run like a champ.

**The TL;DR Version:**

* Never flash from the ROM Manager application. You should always reboot into recovery

* A full wipe erases the entire phone. All data, in addition to erasing the cache and dalvik cache.

* A dirty flash is installing a new version of a ROM without selecting the ""Wipe data/factory reset"" option in recovery.

* You probably don't have to do a full wipe

* If you've installed any sort of UI mod (e.g. custom theme)

* If you are switching ROMs

* You should always use Titanium Backup to back up the apps that are colored green and white before rebooting to flash.

* You should always make a backup in recovery before flashing. You never know.

* You should always erase the cache

* You should always re-flash GAPPS and your kernel after flashing your ROM upgrade.

* If you experience issues after dirty flashing

Thank you for reading.

It would typically show 2 bars, or they would hang for a significant about of time before being rejected. People would try to call me and get sent straight to voicemail without my phone ringing. Web pages would also be slow to load or wouldn't load.

I've also heard of screen defects

But the weird part is that I haven't heard as much complaining about these issues as I would expect. Do very few people have the Verizon version? Did they just go through many replacements until they got a working phone? 

**So if you have a Verizon Galaxy Nexus that works adequately:**

*1. Is this your first one? If not

*2. Does the area where you live have great 4G coverage?*

*3. What version/ROM of Android are you running?*

*4. What are your radios?*

I see a lot of issues going on here. My ONLY complaint

I havent had any hiccups, when EVERYTHING was updating at once. Im still stock though, and only wanted to root to use WiFi tether, until I discovered FoxFi.

It describes how a Galaxy Nexus user stumbled upon a way to enable WiFi tether on his VZW GN without root by simply using the [Switch Pro Widget](https://market.android.com/details?id=alei.switchpro&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDEsImFsZWkuc3dpdGNocHJvIl0.) WiFi Hotspot switch.  Then I realized that I already had that widget so I gave it a try.

Normally, you are offered the chance to add the overpriced service to enable WiFi tether.

Something magic happens when you tap on the Switch Pro Widget WiFi Hotspot switch.  It activates the service.  When you tap to configure it, but still running stock 4.0.2.  My buddy's GN is not rooted and it still worked for him as well.

Any way

Good luck!",,t5_2sypj,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyNexus/comments/p67sp/new_way_to_enable_wifi_tether_on_galaxy_nexus/

First off, Google, etc.  I am not being paid for this, this is purely so that other people who don't know about googlewallet can try it out. So, without further ado...


ATTN: I HAVE BEEN TOLD THE $10 PROMOTION ONLY WORKS IN THE UNITED STATES.

about Google Wallet: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsaJMhcLm_A

Last night, I had already bought a soda at 7/11.  Paying with my phone completely blew the mind of the cashier.  So here's the tutorial.



PREFACE:  If you are using any GSM version of the Galaxy Nexus

1. For whatever reason, download the following apk and install it.  At first, I believed that root access was required, but people have told me this is not the case.

http://www.mediafire.com/?k6hwy353z2i2fe8

2. If you are using the maguro version of the Gnex, however, I will be continuing this guide assuming the phone is rooted.  Don't worry, this doesn't change anything.  EDIT:  Someone told me that some GSM versions do not support google wallet and are unable to download through the playstore.  If this describes your phone, use the mediafire download link above.  EDIT:  Sadly, this doesn't work everywhere in the world.  Dutch user FeikoW, reported the following when opening the wallet app.  http://imgur.com/Ff97D.  Still, so don't give up before trying.

3. Firstly, so let it do its thing.  During this process, An attention (!) sign will appear in your notification bar, it's google wallet asking for account permissions.  Accept.  When I did this part, after accepting the permissions, Gwallet froze, so I had to force stop from the settings-&gt;app menu and then re-launch Gwallet.  Once it's done, you should be greeted with [this](http://i.imgur.com/xwLdq.png) screen.

4. You may notice a yellow banner that says unsupported device.  Don't worry about that.  Everything will work just fine.  It is merely a word of caution about using wallet while rooted.  I will explain at the end.

5. Now here's where it all comes together.  Swipe to the left to uncover 'add google prepaid card'.  tap it and wait ~3 minutes.  Don't force stop

6. You should now see ""$10.00 remaining"" listed under the google prepaid card you just activated!  You can easily add more cash by tapping the card and selecting 'add funds'.

YOU NOW HAVE GOOGLE WALLET FULLY SET UP AND READY TO GO!  Wasn't that easy?  Didn't even have to enter any personal information.  Now, and when you are ready to pay, simply tap the NFC reader with your galaxy nexus (the part with the green light), this will open the Google Wallet app.  It will prompt you for your pin.  Enter it and tap the NFC reader again to compete payment.  Now look at the face of the cashier as you just paid for something with a telephone.

MSG FOR ROOTED GWALLET USERS:  The reason google displays 'unsupported device' when using a rooted Gnex is because of the security issues associated with root.  When you give an app root access

Thanks for reading and hopefully some people will see and use this to their advantage.  Feel free to reply with any questions you may have.  I'm no Gwallet expert

So after writing my [Guide on how to root and install a custom ROM](http://redd.it/txs87) and realized just how easy it really is I was curious as to which ROM ACTUALLY performed best. With that in mind I grabbed every benchmarking tool I could find off of the App Store and installed them. I wiped my phone and systematically installed Stock, Slim ICS, and LiquidSmooth.

After this I decided to try out the phone at work before lunch break. Threw the battery in. The screen is a wonky colour

Out goes the battery. On my lunch break I used tools at a local scuba diving store where I  work on the side to open the phone up (we have watch tools and an airgun). First

**Status after rice for 16ish hours?** Now that I could see the internals...

1) Water droplets inside still. 16 hours is not long enough to dry. I airgunned that out.

2) Connections in there are especially still wet. BAD BAD BAD. I popped off connectors

3) It still doesn't work properly with the touchscreen. 

I left it in pieces like this

During this time I researched. Turns out the reason the touch screen probably doesn't work is because any bit of water will make it constantly think it's being touched. Which means none of your presses will register.

**Lesson here is it NEEDS FUCKING TIIIIIME to dry out.** You can accelerate this process by opening it up but that doesn't seem necessary. Borrow a friends phone or some shit for the time being. Let it dry for a goddamn week if you really want to be safe. It took me a day

The touch screen is still sketchy but I bet that'll continue get better with a little time, speaker are very easy. I'm not really worried too much anymore.

I'll update this post again to report whether I get full functionality or not. I'm also going to take pictures of where I found the water remained. I'm going to try to restore full functionality and if I need to replace parts I'll document that too.

And when someone else posts about what to do, galaxy nexus, and repair maybe they'll get this post.

I'm a somewhat security concerned person. I'd prefer to have my phone encrypted. However, as CWM couldn't flash a new ROM since the internal storage was encrypted and thus you couldn't get the .zip. I'm somewhat familiar with dm-crypt, after having used it on my laptop for years. But unfortunately, CWM just doesn't include the proper support.

Previously

Another option may be to use a USB-OTG dongle with a small USB drive. Still

However, they've added the necessary bits to decrypt your data partition. An added bonus is that it is [open source](https://github.com/TeamWin/Team-Win-Recovery-Project).

So, my phone rebooted and asked for my decryption PIN. Great! Paired with something like Cerberus, it will allow me to remotely reboot my phone rather than wipe it if I think I'll get the device back, while staying fairly confident that my data is safe.

Additionally, and has written a [utility to change the encryption passphrase](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.nick.cryptfs.passwdmanager), so you can have a stronger password to decrypt the device on boot than you need to unlock it once booted.

In a nutshell:

0. Backup
1. Install the current TWRP2 recovery (if you use goo-manager
2. Set a lock PIN
3. Enable encryption
4. Wait
5. Use ""Cryptfs passwd"" to change your encryption PIN to a better password

1367100171.0,1d8lhp,About the dalvik.vm.heap stuff to fix lag,ickboblikescheese,40,9,10,"There has been much discussion lately about the following lines in build.prop:

    dalvik.vm.heapgrowthlimit=96m

and

    dalvik.vm.heapsize=256m

It was suggested that you change it to 64 and 384 respectively. However

&gt;I compared all the build props for the Nexus S, Nexus 4 and Nexus 10.
&gt;
&gt;The guy was definitely wrong about the second value, and has gradually over time: heapstartsize and heapgrowthlimit were introduced with Android 4.0; and heaptargetutilization, heapminfree and heapmaxfree were introduced with Android 4.2. Probably the dynamic control Google was talking about in the link above.
&gt;
&gt;So what the guy was talking about was only half the story.
&gt;
&gt;It actually went from (takju-imm76i and takju-jzo54k):
&gt;dalvik.vm.heapstartsize=8m
&gt;dalvik.vm.heapgrowthlimit=64m
&gt;dalvik.vm.heapsize=256m
&gt;
&gt;To (takju-jdq39):
&gt;dalvik.vm.heapstartsize=8m
&gt;dalvik.vm.heapgrowthlimit=96m
&gt;dalvik.vm.heapsize=256m
&gt;dalvik.vm.heaptargetutilization=0.75
&gt;dalvik.vm.heapminfree=512k
&gt;dalvik.vm.heapmaxfree=8m
&gt;
&gt;Which makes perfect sense if the actual size is something like a function of the targetutilization and the growthlimit. 0.75 * 96m = 72m. And following from that, but now in Android 4.2 it has a further margin to expand if required where it didn't before. Probably a good thing. Programmatically buffers are better than hard limits.
&gt;
&gt;If that is the case then setting it to 64 is not the same as reverting to the 4.0-4.1 values, maybe the N7 is the one that it should have been increased on and the GN is correct. The N4 and N10 both have growth at 192m, and size at 512m, so the N7 is more the odd-one-out now.
&gt;
&gt;Anyway, clearly depending on how much memory the specific device has available, so I don't think they're worth the headache to accommodate or our time to tune when Google clearly knows better than the guy who filed the issue. 

and

&gt;Follow-up: The N7 is definitely the odd one out.
&gt;
&gt;These are the values for the N4 and N10:
&gt;dalvik.vm.heapgrowthlimit=192m
&gt;dalvik.vm.heapsize=512m
&gt;dalvik.vm.heaptargetutilization=0.75
&gt;
&gt;0.75 / 2 = 0.375 * 512 = 192.
&gt;
&gt;GN:
&gt;dalvik.vm.heapgrowthlimit=96m
&gt;dalvik.vm.heapsize=256m
&gt;dalvik.vm.heaptargetutilization=0.75
&gt;
&gt;0.75 / 2 = 0.375 * 256 = 96.
&gt;
&gt;N7:
&gt;dalvik.vm.heapgrowthlimit=64m &lt;=
&gt;dalvik.vm.heapsize=384m
&gt;dalvik.vm.heaptargetutilization=0.75
&gt;
&gt;0.75 / 2 = 0.375 * 384 = 144.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Three devices makes a pattern. So however the new implementation of dalvik heapsize works
&gt;
&gt;Gotta do your homework before taking it to The Man! 

Links: [First post](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=40753047&amp;postcount=41327)

If you skipped over it, so directly replicating the 4.1 values might not work. However, Google's numbers might not be the best, either. 

If you checked his formula

&gt;Nah that post was just a guess - I wouldn't use it to try and figure anything out, raising it to 96m, in practice, might not actually be that far off of the old dalvik heap's 64m.
&gt;
&gt;I'd go more by what Google's math actually seems to be
&gt;
&gt;So you were potentially more correct with 64/256/0.5 since 0.5 / 2 = 0.25 * 256 = 64. 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;To assume Google has that wrong

&gt;     hs=`getprop dalvik.vm.heapsize | cut -dm -f1`;
    htu=`getprop dalvik.vm.heaptargetutilization`;
    hgl=`awk -v htu=$htu -v hs=$hs 'BEGIN { print (htu / 2) * hs }'`;
    setprop dalvik.vm.heapgrowthlimit $hgl'm';

&gt;This init.d script snippet takes the build.prop numbers and calculates/sets the heapgrowthlimit by Google's current formula. As is
&gt;
&gt;As always

[Link](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=40781369&amp;postcount=41359).

This might mean something, the GN and N7 aren't exactly the same as N4 and N10 as they each have 2GB RAM while we have 1GB. Perhaps dividing by 3 is the way to go? Feel free to try it out, divide by 2 or 3. One thing is for sure, and that **dalvik.vm.heapsize** is 256. It's been like that for as long as the GNex existed, and it shall remain as that. Play with **dalvik.vm.heaptargetutilization** and divide by either 2 or 3 to generate **dalvik.vm.heapgrowthlimit**. 

Here's some other info: 

* What I'm using: 64/256/0.5

* The TW 4.1.2 ROMs for the Skyrocket use the ""new"" method of dalvik heap

* You can check values without flashing the ROM by downloading the zip, and checking the mentioned lines. 

* 4.1.1: old system

* 4.2.2_r1.2 is the same as 4.2.2.

Sorry for the lengthy post, like kernel settings, this sweet spot is unique to each device. Or, it could apply to everyone. Anyways, please share your results.

EDIT: While the value of these might not matter, 4.2.1, and 4.2.2_r1.2, it's set at 512k. Only in 4.2.2 is it 2m. I'm guessing 512k is the correct one. ",,False,,1367192434.0,t3_1d8lhp

[How to Replace a Charging Port in a Galaxy Nexus](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AzUM6_HwWk)

One piece of advice I would give when purchasing your replacement piece is to make sure you are purchasing for your model. For example

My replacement part cost $7. I bought a tool kit (mini screw driver

If you have any questions I'd be happy to answer and I'm sure some people with more experience than me would be willing to share as well. I owe it to this community for helping me find the guide and the confidence to find a fix myself.

1357767162.0,169t58,Got a nexus 4 last month and I just bought my second Galaxy Nexus.,rem7,47,14,43,"**tl;dr** The gnex is probably one of best phones I've ever used owned.



This is just a post about things I love about the gnex

In August I was using a borrowed LG Optimus L9. I really wanted to get the Nexus 4 but it wasn't coming out until November. I had the option to keep the L9 and pay for it, charger, and rooted. I started playing with ROMs and tweaking it to my liking, it was a huge jump from the L9 and I immediately fell in love with my used-new-to-me gnex. 

Fast forward to December... I placed an order and received my Nexus 4. I was so excited, or sell it. Everyday after I came home from work my gnex would be on my desk, and I would grab it just to play with it and I would fall in love with it again, it sort of became like my tablet. I don't own a tablet but this was my goto device when I was home. I used it for browsing or chatting while I sat and watched TV and occasionally played some games. I know a lot of people prefer the IPS screen on the N4 to the AMOLED screen of the Samsung devices but I have to disagree. All this arguments about ""flat colors are more real"" is bullshit to me. I don't care if the colors aren't ""realistic"". When I am playing a game like Dead Space, which has nothing realistic about it, I want the saturated red bright blood to pop on the screen, and I want the deep black shadows to be... the deepest possible black... like I would imagine they are in space, something that in ""reality"" I will never experience.

The N4 is built really well, it just feels... ""right"" I don't know how to describe it, but it feels very different from the N4. 

During Christmas my mother came to visit me, she too fell in love with it and decided to keep it. I was happy she changed to Android, especially to a Nexus... but I was a bit sad that I wasn't going to have my gnex around anymore. It's been a couple of weeks since she left and it has really made me miss my gnex, so I have decided to buy another one. My top reasons: 

1. The screen
2. I will also probably root it again and flash some roms including Ubuntu
3. When work is slow I used to hook up the HDMI to my monitor and watch netflix. Can't do that anymore with my N4.
4. It's nice to have an unlocked GSM device for when I travel. Maybe somedays I'll leave the N4 at home and take this baby out.
5. Because its probably one of the best phones I have owned.

What would I change if I could? Make it a quadcore. I mean the gnex is fast, but that is great news for phone makers. The Nexus brand is becoming an important product. I'm sure phone makers are going to be begging to be part of the next nexus. Samsung (to me) makes the best devices and it has the pipeline to deliver more phones on launch date than LG.

So as soon as I get my new gnex,False,,t5_2sypj,False,,,t3_169t58

Initial reactions:

* goddamn my screen is huge. i'm used to running 1920x1080 off my laptop on my 23"" screen

* multitasking - a staple of corporate productivity - can be ranked as ""adequate"". Alt+Tab works to show the Recents window

* email/calendar is more than adequate for corporate needs

* RDP - I'm using PocketCloud Free for RDP access, I use lots of keyboard shortcuts in Outlook (like Ctrl+Shift+V to move items), and I've noticed that Ctrl is a ""StickyKey"", meaning it works more like Caps Lock (click once to activate, once to disable), which is taking some getting used to. Also, there appears to be a delay when typing, which leads to omissions like ""I'm going to the store"" ends up as ""I'm gohestre"". Not a huge deal

* HEAT. Since MHL is essentially just mirroring the GNex screen, I've resorted to dropping the screen brightness all the way down, and to reduce burn-in on the Nav bar I've reduced it to 24px (AOKP lets you do this). I'm a little concerned about the notification bar, however, since that is not hidden while in most apps (I've got it hidden on the home screen via Apex).

* Remote file access - haven't had any need for this

UPDATES:

5/15 13:00EST - Switched to Paranoid Android (from AOKPm5). IT'S GLORIOUS!

5/16 10:45EST - Last night, with intense flickering and aspect ratio issues, but they seem to have resolved themselves after a reboot. Have to type up a blog post and do some spreadsheet work today, so I'm going to give OfficeSuite a run through and see how it holds up. If the reviews are any indication, it should be good to go.

5/17 11:15EST - So both the word processing and spreadsheet apps worked great - spreadsheets aren't quite as robust as Excel (as expected), Email, and PocketCloud RDP is excellent.  This morning I tried using my iPad in place of the GNex (hooked it up to a monitor, BT keyboard and mouse) and the experience was nowhere near as fulfilling.  Over the past few days, I've grown accustomed to the workflow on the GNex, and the iPad would take some getting used to, I think.  I've decided that I'm going to get an Android tablet in the future, so I'm not really comfortable with some of the limitations and layout of iOS) - the only hard part is deciding on the one that I want.

1342830574.0,wwhbr,First impressions moving from the LTE to HSPA+ Galaxy Nexus,e40,37,12,79,"I got my LTE GN on launch day.  I was second in line at my local Verizon store.  I've been happy with the device and have had very few problems.  I have had a problem with Verizon service

The wife, so I made the jump.  Here are my initial impressions.

* First thing I noticed was I could update to 4.1 immediately.  Ahhhhhhhhhh.  That felt good.

* The GSM version goes from Wifi/airplane mode to EDGE/HSPA+ **very quickly** compared to my LTE GN.  This is a godsend

* The power button on the new GN is much better.  I can't really describe it

* I'm on the TMO $30/mo, though).  I can't tell you how nice it feels to not pay close to $80/mo.

The downsides to TMO:

* The pre-paid website sucks balls and barely works (I had to use IE Tab in Chrome to get anywhere).  I had to use the phone to add time to my son's new (feature) phone (which I got on ebay for $40).  He has a $15/mo plan with unlimited text

* Since it's considered pre-paid, so I'll throw a CC on the account and setup auto-renew (if the damn website will work!!).

* The speeds of HSPA+ when I have full bars is about 3Mbps.  My LTE GN was a good deal faster than that, HSPA+ isn't really true 4G.   TMO does call it that, though, so I'm using their terminology.

* 100 minutes goes fast, though.  I didn't realize it until recently that you can add a SIP account to the settings in the Phone app and tell it to make VoIP calls all the time (or ask).  Between my work and home I have a strong 4G connection (it starts about 1 block from my house... grrrrr), and I tested it today talking all the way.  I have to say, it sounded better than my old VZ GN on the ""best network in the country.""

Overall I am very happy I made the switch.  I did a spreadsheet and I'll come out about $200 ahead over 18 months I won't be with Verizon.  After that, which adds up fast.

I just hope TMO doesn't do away with the plan I'm on.  They sure make it hard to find and sign up for,False,,t5_2sypj,1342876875.0,,,t3_wwhbr

**2. Install Packages**

    cd {PATH TO DOWNLOADED FILES} &amp;&amp; sudo dpkg -i *.deb

    

**3. Configure FUSE**

    sudo chmod a+r /etc/fuse.conf
    sudo gedit /etc/fuse.conf

Uncomment (remove the '#' symbol before) the following line:

    user_allow_other

Save the file and exit Gedit.

    

**4. Create Mount Point**

    sudo mkdir /media/MyAndroid
    sudo chmod 777 /media/MyAndroid

    

**5. Capture UDEV Details**

Next

Now, turn on MTP.

In Ubuntu

     udevadm monitor --environment --udev &gt;&gt; ~/Desktop/udev_no_debugging.txt

Plug in your Android device, then hit CTRL+C.

Back to your phone

Now

     udevadm monitor --environment --udev &gt;&gt; ~/Desktop/udev_with_debugging.txt

Plug in your Android device, then hit CTRL+C.

Now

     gedit ~/Desktop/udev_no_debugging.txt ~/Desktop/udev_with_debugging.txt &amp;&amp; sudo gedit /etc/udev/rules.d/99-android.rules

You should have one gedit window as root with the 99-android.rules file and another gedit windows NOT as root with two tabs open.  The first tab is what we'll call the ""Debugging Off"" device data

    

**6. Create UDEV Rules** (Note

Copy and paste everything between the ""____"" below into the gedit window with 99-android.rules opened currently.

-----
    # Android MTP
    SUBSYSTEM==""usb"", MODE=""0666""	# Debugging off
    SUBSYSTEM==""usb"", MODE=""0666""	# Debugging on

    ENV{ID_MODEL}==""{YOUR_ID_MODEL}"", RUN+=""/usr/bin/sudo -u {YOUR_USER_ID_HERE} /usr/bin/go-mtpfs-unity unmount""	# Debugging on

-----

Using the data from the ""Debugging Off"" file

 - replace {YOUR_ID_VENDOR_ID} with what the value after the '=' shows on the line that starts with

 - replace {YOUR_ID_MODEL} with what the value after the '=' shows on the line that starts with

 - replace {YOUR_ID_MODEL_ID} with what the value after the '=' shows on the line that starts with


Using the data from the ""Debugging On"" file

 - replace {YOUR_ID_VENDOR_ID} with what the value after the '=' shows on the line that starts with

 - replace {YOUR_ID_MODEL} with what the value after the '=' shows on the line that starts with

 - replace {YOUR_ID_MODEL_ID} with what the value after the '=' shows on the line that starts with


Replace {YOUR_USER_ID_HERE} with your Ubuntu user ID.

Save the file and close all Gedit windows.

    

**7. FSTAB Declaration**

In order to be able to ""Safely Remove"" or unmount your Android device

Connect your device and run the following command:

    /usr/bin/go-mtpfs-unity mount

Now run the following command:

    mount

You should see a listing that starts with

    DeviceFs(Galaxy Nexu on /media/GalaxyNexus type fuse.DeviceFs(Galaxy Nexu (rw,user=towens)

We are interested in the following 2 chunks:

    DeviceFs(Galaxy Nexu                            fuse.DeviceFs(Galaxy Nexu

Now

    sudo gedit /etc/fstab

Copy and paste everything between '____' to the end of your FSTAB file:



-----
    # My Android Device
    DeviceFs({DEVICE}) /media/MyAndroid fuse.DeviceFs({DEVICE}) allow_other,noauto 0 0

-----


- Replace ""DeviceFs({DEVICE})"" with the first of the 2 chunks from the mount command earlier.  If you have a space

        DeviceFS(Galaxy\040Nexu

Note: Your device listed when you ran the ""mount"" command may not have the completing (right) paranthesis ')' or even have the name of the device completed.  As you can see from my examples above, ""DeviceFS(Galaxy Nexu"", and edited my FSTAB file with ""DeviceFs(Galaxy\040Nexu""

- Replace ""fuse.DeviceFs({DEVICE})"" with the 2nd of the 2 chunks from the mount command earlier.  Same thing applies here if your device name is not complete or if it has a space.  So mine looked like this:


        # My Android Device
        DeviceFs(Galaxy\040Nexu /media/MyAndroid fuse.DeviceFs(Galaxy\040Nexu allow_other,noauto 0 0


When done

    

**8. Reboot and Enjoy**

* My nandroid backups are gone!

* My TiBu/RTP app backups are gone!

1. Use a root-enabled file explorer and browse to /sdcard. 

2. Do you see a ""0"" folder? If you do

3. Go to /data/media. All your files are here, you should definitely see a ""0"" folder if all your files aren't in /data/media.

4. Move everything to /sdcard. Feel free to delete the ""0"" folder. ***DO NOT*** delete /data/media. /data/media/0 should be ok though. 

5. Update your recovery to either the [latest CWM](http://www.clockworkmod.com/rommanager) or the [latest TWRP](http://goo.im/devs/openrecovery). Flash that through fastboot. This will prevent ""your files going missing"" in the future. Note that you can't restore backups made by CWM with TWRP

I took today to do a battery test on my VZW GNex with an OEM 2100 mAh battery.  I didn't do anything real intensive.  Text, and a whole bunch of redditing (reddit is fun app); which included viewing pics and videos.  This is pretty normal for when I have nothing to do and I have recorded around 5 hours of screen on time before doing this on 4.2.2.  This was with WiFi on the whole time, bla bla.

[So

* 12h 13m 55s uptime

* 7h 5m 50s screen on time

I don't have Greenify or anything like that but I have disabled location for Facebook through the stock ""App Ops"" settings.  I'm using whatever kernel the Shiny ROM came with and no changes have been made to clock speed or voltage.  Other than root and some root apps (TiBu, Cerberus), everything is how the Shiny ROM comes.  All of my fellow VZW GNex users feel my pain in the battery life department.  With stock battery and stock ROM, I'd be lucky to get 2hrs screen on time.  I haven't done a comparison test with the stock battery but it did seem to hold up a lot longer at work than on 4.2.2.

* Now
* Make sure you have a decent signal either on 3G or 4G.
* Install the downloaded VerizonLogonClient.apk
* Start your Verizon app (such as MyVerizon)
* Log in like normal if it prompts you.
* That's it.

The reason you are having this issue is the VerizonLogonClient app is either missing or has the incorrect permissions.  It is a system app so it gets treated differently.  Reinstalling it usually resolves the issue.

The other reason you are having this issue is because the first time you attempt to connect to Verizon with one of their apps

1324152177.0,ngloj,Diztronic case - Galaxy Nexus LTE (Verizon),easyski,24,2,18,"This is a mini review of the Diztronic case for the Galaxy Nexus.  

I purchased this case from [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=diztronic+galaxy+nexus&amp;x=0&amp;y=0)

[Link to album with comparison pictures](http://imgur.com/a/nEwQW#0)

This is the first case I have purchased for my Gnex, but plastic soft.  It is flexible and the phone ""snaps"" into the case very easily.  I do not have the extended battery in, but will have it in a few days.  (It is half off ($25) at verizon right now [LINK](http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/store/accessory?action=accessoryDetails&amp;archetypeId=12917&amp;accessoryId=49870) it shows up 49.99 on product page, add to cart and hit checkout, shows $24.99) and I think the case will still work as there are some pictures floating around that show that the extended battery does not really add much thickness. (I'll update this post then).

It has a nice feel to it and I don't think it really adds much thickness (or weight).  My last phone was the OG droid and I never used a case on that, not so much.  I like the translucent smoke as I think it fits more along the lines of the original color pattern of the Gnex, but there are other colors available.  

As far as protection factor goes, it does bounce a little, and the thud isn't quite so harsh, but I still wouldn't drop it on purpose.  

I also chose this case over some others because on product pages, the phone will definitely land on this unprotected area.

The only negative I have about this is that the volume rocker area is NOT cut out

Pre-ordered this thing over a month ago, none on the field, or screen part. 

Maybe because of this lack of adhesive on the screen, and maybe I'll just adjust to it after a day or two. 

Only major problem was that I had reduced the size of the nav bar, maybe it was the protector. Not sure. 

Supposedly this has an oleophobic coating

Anyway, without worrying about jacking up the actual screen. I'd recommend it.

Update: I can no longer recommend this thing. I had it on for three or four days before taking it off. The reduced screen sensitivity drove me crazy. Sometimes the nav bar buttons would just totally stop registering touches until I turned the screen off and on again. I also didn't realize how much I'd liked having the notification light being invisible until it's turned on. There's a very visible cutout on the protector.

Features:

* /sdcard partition backup/restore

* bootloader unlock/relock

* flash custom recovery image

* flash custom ROMs and Google Apps

Screenshot: http://i.imgur.com/iSlYVn0.png

Note: I have zero programming experience so the script is messy/disgusting/awful and has no error-handling capabilities so it may or may not break at random. This won't backup the contents of your /data partition

**Make sure to check that the contents of your /sdcard partition have been properly backed up to the computer before unlocking the bootloader**.

Usage:

0. enable ""Android debugging"" in [settings] -&gt; developer options

However, the other is holding a bag, or if you're from the UK... an umbrella.

It's relatively easy to implement a widget to switch the input method but I was looking for a more elegant

I thought I'd share it with /r/Android :

***What you'll need:***

* [Tasker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm)
* [Secure Settings](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.intangibleobject.securesettings.plugin)
* A rooted phone
* A ROM that supports lock screen editing e.g. [CM10](http://www.cyanogenmod.org/) or [WidgetLocker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teslacoilsw.widgetlocker)

	
Pictural guide: **http://imgur.com/a/CnUv7#0**


***The process:***

	1) Install Tasker and Secure Settings
	2) Create a new profile on Tasker: event &gt; display &gt; display off
	3) For the context of the profile
	
    At this point it may ask you to install the Secure Settings helper

	The purpose of this profile and task is to 'reset' your keyboard each time the screen is locked.
	
	Now to assign your 1-handed keyboard!
	
	4) Settings &gt; lock screen &gt; slider shortcuts &gt; drag to a position &gt; select 'Task Cut'
	5) Tasker should open up and create a new task
	6) Assign a nice icon. 

I made this 'S'
	
	Done!

Hi all, no carrier involved) in for repair, and Samsung have replied saying that the warranty has been invalidated due to water damage. They're happy to perform the repair for a fee of ~£50.

Now, so much so that both my GN and my old Nexus One are still 'mint' condition. I keep the GN in a neoprene sleeve, and refuse to use it whenever it is raining. Therefore, whatever they are claiming as water damage is in fact due to using the phone in normal atmospheric conditions only.

I asked for proof of the water damage (along with proof that it is indeed *my* phone), no scale is provided. My job is an electrical engineer for the design of submersible ROVs, so I have seen my fair share of water damaged objects. I believe that the image does not constitute sufficient evidence that water damage has occurred, and that any discoloration caused is due to use within normal atmospheric conditions.

I have tried talking to a representative on the phone for hours, then there's water damage. I asked whether there is anyway for me to prove otherwise (which is almost impossible, see [Evidence of absence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence_of_absence)), and was told to get an independent review of the phone. However, doing so would void my warranty.

I was also told that the damage may not have been caused by me, and it would be unreasonable for any customer to perform this check. Overall, it seems the repair center is playing the 'water damage' card, which in this case has not happened. Overall, my experience with representatives has been awful, with all sorts of wild explanations and reasons being thrown around.

I was wondering if anyone had any ideas on how to progress with this matter? At the moment my only realistic option seems to be to pay the £50 and get the phone repaired. This would be a travesty of justice in my eyes, Samsung are such a giant compared to me, that I feel powerless to do anything else...

I am using a GSM Samsung Galaxy Nexus phone.   
I live in Australia.   
When my phone is 100% charged and left on standby/idle it takes almost 2.5 hours to lose 1%.      

**4.0.4 Update** I manually flashed to 4.0.4 IMM76D (the OTA update didn't come for me even when using the clearing cache from google services framework trick MANY times) using the fastboot commands from [this site](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1391881). I also flashed the radio that came with the zip file(XXLA02). I then noticed that my battery lost 1% about every hour.   
I was not a happy camper. I've heard praise about how the 4.0.4 update improves battery performance
**My battery now loses 1% every 5 hours on standby/idle.**   
   
**Update:** I just received an OTA update. My phone is now the 4.0.4 IMM76I build. Am hoping that this doesn't affect my battery in a negative way.   
   
**Update 2**  My phone now loses 1% every 3 hours while on standby.  I don't think I waited long enough for the battery usage monitor to properly calibrate. 1% every 5 hours did seem too good to be true. Either way,False,,t5_2sypj,True,,,t3_sm5cr

* Application: very easy
  
* Look: You do get a sense of the thickness of the product, you can definitely see a difference. Especially if comparing it side by side to a GNex without it. You can also see some grid-dots on the product when the screen is off.  
  
*  Use: I have been seeing decreased sensitivity to touches near the bottom of the screen (aka, and switch apps buttons). Definitely more touches that aren't recognized. Also, it seems to mess with the ambient light sensor on the phone, when it's on, it reads the ambient light as darker and so it dims the screen more than it should.
  
* Cleaning: It's advertised as ""easier to clean"" than the stock screen and I agree. A quick wipe on the shorts/pants seems to get rid of most fingerprints and grime.

For one item

They're riding that fine line between ignorance and deceit

**tl;dr**  They're selling the same worthless Vehicle Navigation Mount as Verizon **EDIT** and apparently the non-3-pin charging

What follows is a transcript of my chat conversation with Fommy customer support.

    Hello mortodestructo

1:09:00 PM: mortodestructo:
    Hi there.

1:09:26 PM: mortodestructo:
    I have a few quick questions about items in my order.

1:09:50 PM: Agent 1:
    let me check this for you

1:10:25 PM: mortodestructo:
    First off

1:10:51 PM: mortodestructo:
    I notice several discrepancies now

1:12:03 PM: Agent 1:
    We are expecting the items in stock by tomorrow

1:12:14 PM: mortodestructo:
    First off

1:12:24 PM: Agent 1:
    we will ship your order by tomorrow

1:12:51 PM: mortodestructo:
    I would like to verify that I am receiving the items I'm expecting before the order ships

1:13:29 PM: mortodestructo:
    The description of the dock

1:13:54 PM: mortodestructo:
    ""The right side of the cradle features an HDMI female port"" - this part in particular.

1:14:13 PM: mortodestructo:
    The landscape-style dock does not feature an HDMI port.

1:14:34 PM: mortodestructo:
    I pre-ordered the item expecting the item pictured on the web page above.

1:15:24 PM: mortodestructo:
    Can you tell me with any certainty whether this dock is actually the landscape-style dock?  I do not wish to purchase the portrait-style one.

1:15:45 PM: Agent 1:
    Please wait I am checking

1:17:53 PM: Agent 1:
    This is an OEM product from Samsung

1:18:04 PM: Agent 1:
    &amp; it will be exactly as pictured on our website

1:18:52 PM: mortodestructo:
    I assume the same answer will apply to my next question about the Samsung® (OEM) Vehicle Navigation Mount.

1:19:30 PM: Agent 1:
    yes

1:20:44 PM: mortodestructo:
    Why are there discrepancies between the items pictured and the product descriptions?

1:21:12 PM: mortodestructo:
    This is very confusing.

1:21:41 PM: Agent 1:
    which line in the product desc is wrong

1:23:07 PM: mortodestructo:
    The HDMI line on the Multimedia Dock.

1:23:31 PM: mortodestructo:
    Also

1:24:11 PM: mortodestructo:
    Verizon Wireless' model does not charge the device or route audio.

1:24:49 PM: Agent 1:
    can you please show me that link

1:24:58 PM: mortodestructo:
    http://www.fommy.com/view-full-page.php?skuno=93056

1:25:21 PM: Agent 1:
    not this one

1:25:28 PM: Agent 1:
    the verizon one

1:26:20 PM: mortodestructo:
    http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/store/accessory?&amp;action=accessoryDetails&amp;accessoryId=49882

1:26:31 PM: Agent 1:
    okay! let me see please

1:26:51 PM: mortodestructo:
    When you're done

1:27:08 PM: mortodestructo:
    It has a USB port and audio out jack pictured on the base of the device.

1:27:57 PM: Agent 1:
    let me see please

1:31:16 PM: mortodestructo:
    Now, I notice that on their website, the Multimedia Dock is the portrait-style model (http://www.expansys-usa.com/samsung-google-galaxy-nexus-multimedia-dock-225460/) and the landscape-style model is called the Desk Stand (http://www.expansys-usa.com/samsung-google-galaxy-nexus-desk-stand-226695/).

1:31:33 PM: mortodestructo:
    This is what has me concerned.

1:32:08 PM: mortodestructo:
    I'm afraid that I'm purchasing an item I already have (the same navigation mount that Verizon sells) and an item I don't want (the portrait-style Multimedia Dock).

1:32:42 PM: Agent 1:
    let me see pleaseI am still in process fo checking it

1:32:55 PM: Agent 1:
    let me see pleaseI am still in process *of checking it

1:32:57 PM: mortodestructo:
    Thank you very much.

1:33:21 PM: mortodestructo:
    *i am stepping away from my desk for approximately 30 seconds.  i'll be right back.

1:34:05 PM: Agent 1:
    If you see the verizon one

1:34:46 PM: mortodestructo:
    That's what I was afraid of.  Can you take that off my order and process a refund of that portion of the order?

1:35:20 PM: Agent 1:
    one minute please

1:35:37 PM: Agent 1:
    okay! we are cancelling your order

1:36:04 PM: mortodestructo:
    Also

1:36:53 PM: Agent 1:
    we can say about the product which is shown on our website

1:36:57 PM: Agent 1:
    not about any other

1:37:33 PM: mortodestructo:
    They appear to be exactly the same.  I just wanted to confirm that it is not this item: http://www.expansys-usa.com/samsung-google-galaxy-nexus-multimedia-dock-225460/

1:38:15 PM: Agent 1:
    Again I am saying mortodestructo

1:38:26 PM: Agent 1:
    So

1:38:51 PM: mortodestructo:
    Excellent.

1:38:55 PM: mortodestructo:
    I want this:  http://www.fommy.com/view-full-page.php?skuno=93055

1:39:20 PM: mortodestructo:
    I already own this

1:39:40 PM: Agent 1:
    one min please

1:40:14 PM: Agent 1:
    SKU 93055 is costlier than SKU 93056

1:40:26 PM: mortodestructo:
    I am aware of this.

1:41:24 PM: Agent 1:
    okay! i have a suggestion here - how about we cancel your present order for 93055 &amp; refund on it

1:41:38 PM: Agent 1:
    &amp; after the arrival of product you can check your query with us

1:41:51 PM: Agent 1:
    thus you will be getting the correct product

1:42:11 PM: Agent 1:
    please let me know your opinion

1:42:34 PM: mortodestructo:
    I would like to cancel the order for 93056.

1:42:40 PM: Agent 1:
    ok

1:42:49 PM: mortodestructo:
    I still want 93055 as long as it is as pictured on your website.

1:44:02 PM: Agent 1:
    so

1:44:42 PM: mortodestructo:
    Did you cancel my order for 93055?

1:44:51 PM: Agent 1:
    no

1:44:53 PM: Agent 1:
    hey

1:44:54 PM: mortodestructo:
    Oh

1:45:54 PM: Agent 1:

1:47:03 PM: Agent 1:

1:47:40 PM: Agent 1:
    can you please repeat your query regarding 93056

1:47:41 PM: Agent 1:
    ?

1:47:42 PM: mortodestructo:
    Really?  Does it have the USB &amp; Audio ports on the side of the base?

1:47:50 PM: Agent 1:
    ok let me see

1:47:59 PM: Agent 1:
    please be online with me

1:48:19 PM: Agent 1:

According to Diztronic's main page they're stopping Rev. 3 Nexus case orders for the next 24 hours to prepare for CES.  Amazon will still work though.  But you should probably order direct, making it more expensive.  Shipping is free if you order direct.  

I'd assume there's a window between 24 hours from now and Friday (when they go to CES for over a week and won't be accepting orders on their site) when you should be able to order Rev. 3's again directly from their site.
