Tuesdays in Artpark are amazingly strong this year with some huge classic rock acts. Also a few good Wednesday shows there too. Thursday in Buffalo is better than last year. Lockport looks good as well. Some have the venue denoted if it's on an off day or when TITS switches to the harbor in the second half of the year. I also included some paid shows that will be at Artpark and the harbor. 

I'll be at most of the Lockport shows because I live close. If you haven't been there, lots of facilities, and places to buy cheap $3 beers, and easy free parking. The people and security are all friendly. I'll be at every free Artpark show I can make it to.

Myself and 9 friends had a VIP table at the Paul Oakenfold show at Rendezvous the Niteclub last night.  Paul, up until it came time to pay our tab.

In order to secure the VIP table we put down a $500 deposit.  Any drinks or bottle service would be deducted from that and we'd be charged again for anything over $500 at the end of the night.  When our server brought us our tab at the end of the night she explained that we had only spent $348 of our $500 deposit and suggested we get another bottle.  Not wanting to throw away money

We get a $130 bottle of champagne and enjoy it.  The server then comes back with a receipt for $615.  She apologizes and explains that the computer screwed up and one of our previous bottles was not on the first bill.  We politely refused pay the extra $115 as we had been conned into spending it.  She goes to get her manager.

The manager refused to correct their mistake.  His line was you drank it, or spend the night in jail.  We didn't think $115 was worth sitting in a cell all night.

We will not be going back to Rendezvous

http://www.reddit.com/r/Buffalo/comments/i4uss/reminder_rbuffalo_part_of_global_reddit_meetup/

-----

Hueypriest, June 25th](http://www.reddit.com/r/meetup/comments/h1p8c/circle_the_calendarsglobal_reddit_meetup_2011/) (Arbitrary Day) over in r/Meetup a few days ago.  

I have not been as active in Reddit this week as normal.  And I recently was made a mod at r/Worldnews.... so

So

But I was thinking that we should do a local Buffalo/WNY Meetup.... And since it's on a Saturday

So, cook some hot dogs, maybe play a little football or something, etc.  

And some of us could bring some cameras and take photos and upload them so other Redditors can see what we  all look like

Back in the day

But that's just my idea.... perhaps others with have a better one.  

If you have an idea

Thanks

I found this little girl running around in the middle of Amherst St last week, we are both too busy to give her the attention a puppy deserves.  

She is insanely smart. Seriously. In one week, she is now housebroken and crate trained and she gets along well with other animals. I have taught her to sit when being approached by people on the street and to sit and wait at intersections until given the ""let's go!"" command. She is also learning to ring a bell when she needs to go outside. I work with dogs but the owners won't allow us to bring our own dogs to our facility. 

She is a really fantastic dog, but are well worth the effort. I would love to keep her myself but I have been overruled on this by my roommates and it is true that we really just don't have time right now. 

Tess will go to her new home with food, lots of treats, bones and toys. Please PM me with any questions you may have! Thanks so much!

The top 3 listed in the article are good. There are few many more:  

* Blue Monk's beer garden is pleasant
* Swannie house is a great borderline first ward bar and has an airy patio.  
* Doug's Dive at the small boat harbor is a good escape
* Liberty hound is a great river side spot
* Nobody can beat a baseball game and few drinks in the stands
* a big secret is del denby's where they have a huge yard in the back
* Pearl Street's back deck patio is nice on sunny days.  
* Templeton's can be nice
* Rumor has it
* has rendezvous reopened? they have one of the most comfortable garden patios in the city.  
* Mother's is great.  
* DBGB's has a cozy patio.  
* Gabriel's Gate's patio is better suited for dining
* Miss Buffalo Friday happy hour cruise is always a great time (when she's put to ""sea"").  
* may have forgotten a few other spots around the city

I'm not a huge fan of street side patios, therefore there are cecilia's, bullfeathers, essex, blue monk, goodbar, cole's, shadow

http://www.restorethefourth.net/

This is our official press release on June 18

Restore the Fourth is a grassroots, 2013. Protesters in over 100 cities across America will gather to demand that the government of the United States of America adhere to its constitutionally dictated limits and respect the Fourth Amendment. http://www.RestoretheFourth.net provides a detailed list of protest locations.

Restore the Fourth maintains that justification of the Fourth Amendment beyond the original text need not be given; the legitimacy of which is self-evident. ""The right of the people to be secure in their persons, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and the persons or things to be seized."" The Fourth Amendment of the Bill of Rights clearly protects all citizens’ assets

Restore the Fourth requests that American citizens’ right to privacy is respected and stands with the Electronic Frontier Foundation and StopWatching.us on their open letter to Congress. As informed members of the American electorate

1. Enact reform this Congress to Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act

2. Create a special committee to investigate
this domestic spying. This committee should create specific recommendations for legal
and regulatory reform to end unconstitutional surveillance;

3. Hold accountable those public officials who are found to be responsible for this
unconstitutional surveillance.

The July 4th demonstrations seek to demand an end to the unconstitutional surveillance methods employed by the U.S. government and to ensure that all future government surveillance is constitutional

Restore the Fourth aims to ensure that the will of the people is reflected in the government of the United States of America. This movement intends to bring an end to twelve years of Fourth Amendment abuses,False,,t5_2qi6i,False,,,t3_1h0wls

It will need to be a BYOB event -- Bring You Own Beer, chips, burgers, sandwiches, hot dogs, pizza or whatever it is you will want.    I'm sure people will be willing to share, but don't count on them having enough for you.

So this is the official thread to discuss possible dates and venues. 

Dates : Weekend of July 20th or July 27
Location:Bidwell Park, Chippewa, whatever you guys want, lets throw out ideas, and see what sticks. 

We want to plan something that is inclusionary to as many people as possible. I will show up with my grill and cooler again. People brought beer and nom-noms to eat and cook up. Some people brought appetites and good conversation. Some even brought their canine companions. We want to repeat some of that again this month.

So [this](http://i.imgur.com/iCn1K2k.jpg) is my idea. Please excuse the terrible photoshopping. [This](http://goo.gl/maps/FmGB0) is the Concrete Central area. Using the entire building as the western side of the stadium (ala Soldier Field in Chicago) there is more than enough space that is and has been completely vacant for some time. This land is wasted and dirt cheap

The yellow arrows you see are new and some existing roads that would need to either be built or upgraded. Green checkmarks are surface parking lots

I only used the Ralph as a size comparison to show roughly what we would be looking at as a footprint. I imagine a little bit smaller of a stadium when all is said and done.

As for displacement

With this plan

There are a lot of flaws and infrastructure issues to be dealt with obviously as I am not an engineer or city planner by any means, smart plan. It brings the stadium into the city, it saves waterfront space to be used for something other than a few times a year, it re uses one of the most awesome structures in the area (in my opinion) and doesn't impose on hardly anything local. I really see zero downsides with this plan. 

If anyone is interested in helping me with some design work to make this a bit more presentable, just to at the very least, open up the idea.

**Yes

Nobody really messaged me volunteering much help.  So

It is a **BYOB event** -- Bring You Own Beer, chips, burgers, sandwiches, hot dogs, pizza or whatever it is you will want.    **I'm sure people will be willing to share, but don't count on them having enough for you**.  

If we need to, but I think it's mostly dead until you get down to Hertel (and then your in the middle of the Hertel area).  

We're going to want to make up some signs.  With a Reddit Alien on them.    I'm going to try and make some stuff up, please do so.

It was taken from the corner of Hertel and Norwalk. It is a 2001 silver BMW 325 ci (coupe). It has a dent on the left rear quarter panel and has Rhode Island license plates. I am hoping that the fact that it has Rhode Island license plates makes it stand out a little more. If you see it please contact the buffalo police department.

1320422979.0,m0eop,Just a heads up. Never rent from The Kissling Interests.,somuchdeath18,18,2,22,"Here's the story.

My friend and I wanted a place in the city, we decided that a few bad reviews could just be from a few disgruntled people and rent from them anyways.

Over the summer construction and renovations began, we can deal with a little inconvenience. Then we heard rumors of eviction, and that apartments were to be renovated. After contacting the landlord we found out yes it was true, they are renovating apartments, but they have concessions in place to  help with tenant retention.... ok, we can deal with this too I guess.

Well... I just got out of that meeting. Apparently we their plan is to move us for 2 months minimum into an apartment free of rent (free just for two months, or three year lease. Heres the catch, those renovations need to be paid for right? They busted out their excel sheet with pre-crunched numbers and our rent which was currently 975/month was getting just a little bump to 1475. Oh and that parking we pay 25/month per car? yeah that goes up to 50/month. Electric included in rent? nope, not any more. The director Rose, happily informed us that this 'slight' bump would take care of undesirable tenants (how many undesirable tenants pay a thousand dollars a month for a building which does not take advantage of government housing programs?).

Granted they did offer incentives to help 'ease in' to these new rates. 10% off for a 1 year contract would put us at 1237/month but that doesn't include the new parking costs or the newly added utility bill. I'm sure that the renovations would be very nice

Please don't rent from them. If for purely fiscal reasons alone and not just those mentioned above

[UPDATE] for anyone who cares to check in -

Spent the afternoon at Caffe Aroma with a good book. The coffee was fair and the noise-level suitable for reading. It was sweltering for a bit but they remedied that by opening all the large glass doors which let in a nice breeze.

The music was perfect - I recall hearing ""Quiz

Took a walk from Bidwell Pkwy to Allentown and explored the Elmwood neighborhood.

Rust Belt was my favorite stop of the day.

Thanks everyone for the suggestions. It was nice to spend the day outside checking out my new town.

I met this girl online and we have known each other for almost a year now. She lives in USA and I live in Canada. We have decided to meet mid-way in your awesome city. Neither of us 
has been here before and I would really appreciate some local help.  

###About Us###

- We are in our 20's.
- We don't have a car.
- We'll be visiting late Feb.
- We'll be staying for about 4-5 days.
- We aren't rich. We are using some of our savings for this trip.
- Things we like: History, nature, food, walks.
- Things we are not into: **Neither of us drinks** or smokes and we don't care much for clubbing/partying either.

###Accommodation###

- Which neighborhood should we stay in? We are leaning towards downtown since we don't have a car
- Do you have any specific hotel recommendations? How does the Hyatt compare to the Holiday Inn? (We want a nice hotel experience
- Since we don't want to live in a dump and because all these hotels are a bit of a stretch for us

###Transit###

- How reliable is the transit system? 
- How late can we stay out while relying on the transit?
- Is there some kind of week pass/day pass we should get?

###Things to do###

- Keeping in mind the things we like and the fact that we don't have a car

 
 
###Food###

Like I mentioned

- What are some good places (not super expensive) to eat which have good options for vegetarians? 
- What's a good pasta place?
- What's a good Indian restaurant?
- What coffee/tea place would you recommend where we can just sit and chill for hours and have a nice conversation? Bonus points if it has a good dessert menu. :)

###Other questions###

- I am not a Canadian citizen but I have a multiple entry tourist visa for USA. She has a US passport. Is hopping between USA and Canada multiple times within the trip a problem?
- I'll take the bus and she is gonna reach Buffalo by plane. Is there a waiting area at the arrivals where I can receive her?

Any other suggestions to make this trip awesome and memorable would be great!

Friday night we are going to try a Bisons game. Do they sell out? 

Any tips would be handy!

We are staying in the downtown core.

Edit:
So far we walked to perry st and hit the brewpub for lunch after crossing the border. Picked up their growler and pint glass beer souvenir. That will be yum for later.

We then hit up the city hall observation deck. Besides being a giant middle finger in the sky

Been taking tons of of building pictures. 

Prego wife is taking a power nap before Bisons game for pre-beers (for me).

Any editors going tonight? She might pass out early and I will want to go try some wonderful beers after.


edit 2:

Well turns out the game was a double header, Waddles was tired and hungry so we had to make a quick judgement call. 

Sat we spent the morning we went and saw the Navel Park quickly

WOW. Just Wow. Picked up some cool prints and pieces for the babies room (Space and Robot theme). 

Then  in the other Allen St festival we found Loyd's. HOLY SHITBALLS. soooooooo good. 

5 hours wandering there and swollen feet later

Thanks for hosting a wonderful quick visit. There is so much more we could have seen and spent time doing. We will definitely come back again!

US fans from all over the country will converge on Crew Stadium and it promises to be an awesome time.

Right now we're working with the Rochester &amp; Albany chapters to get a bus chartered that will include transportation to and from the game (leaving in the morning/coming back after the game ends).  

You'll have to get your own tickets [here](http://www.ticketmaster.com/event/050048D9896D4F1E) but there's a STRONG possibility we'll be getting some nice tasty WNY brews for you to sample on the drive down.

1. Everyone I met was very nice. Much friendlier than in Philadelphia

2. You can buy beer in gas stations here. And its half the price of take out beer where I live. Amazing.

3. I went to Duff's with a few other people. The Buffalo native who took us said it was the second best place next to the Anchor Bar ( I did not mention that I got the impression from you guys that Anchor bar was a bit overrated). The wings were good. They were no different than good wings I have had anywhere else though. I was a little disappointed because I expected something different. But they were good nonetheless.

4. Tim Horton's coffee was great

They have Wegman's in PA and I have been to the falls a few times, it was a good trip.

1373660978.0,1i6dt4,New craft brewery planned for downtown Buffalo,BBulaga75,13,3,7,"A group of entrepreneurs are planning to start a small-production craft brewery called the Big Ditch Brewing Co. on Ellicott Street in downtown Buffalo to make and sell its draft product to local bars

The trio behind the new company has selected the two-story former Verizon Communications facility at 337 Ellicott St. as the location for their new business.

It plans to start operations early next year and will be the first production brewery in more than 40 years to locate in downtown Buffalo. Unlike Pearl Street Grill &amp; Brewery not far away

The business will be operated mostly by Matt Kahn, 27, but the group also includes Wesley Froebel. Kahn and Catalano each have “extensive experience” in manufacturing, engineering, research and development and project management in the biotechnology and consumer products industries, which share similar practices with brewing.

“Biotech is very similar to making beer, so we have plenty of experience to be able to run the brewery and to be able to make good beer.”

Froebel, has also been an active shareholder and advisor for Flying Bison Brewing Co. for more than a decade.

The building

Besides selling the beer to eateries and retailers

“From the outset we were committed to establishing our brewery operation in Buffalo

Iskalo bought the 32, in May 2011, and converted the warehouse portion into indoor parking for the nearby Electric Tower, also owned by Iskalo.

But the facility still has some extra room,000 square feet of space. Those possibilities had included apartments or office space, until the Big Ditch group began looking around for space downtown. Iskalo is going before the Zoning Board of Appeals later this month to seek a use variance to permit the brewing activity, which would take up about 4,000 square feet.

The new business is named after the pejorative nickname for the Erie Canal during its construction in the early 1800s

Beer brewing also has a long history in Buffalo

“Craft beer is growing rapidly across the country, and it’s a good fit with our background. And we both love beer. It took a little while to come to the realization of what we want to do, but it made sense and we’re pretty excited.”

The pair have been “brewing and working on this plan” for over two years

“We sort of jumped into it thinking we might start a business, because the process is so similar to what we do in our daily work that we would pick it up pretty quick,” Kahn said. “We work around big tanks all the time in our current jobs, and it’s the same for brewing. We’ve installed those systems, we’ve tested them repeatedly, so it shouldn’t be too much of a jump to operate the brewery.” ",,,,
