1374068095.0,1ihg51,We need to talk about the behavior of modders.,Gerhard2202,501,101,567,"The recent Gregtech / Tinker's Construct fiasco, other mods reverting Vanilla changes made by Greg, and just a general interest in the usage of many mods all together

**We are all here to play Minecraft.** That's the big thing that a lot of people are forgetting. If somebody installs Gregtech, that means they want to have really awesome tools - eventually, seeing as Gregtech delays access to the Nether - while keeping the rigid progression and massive infrastructure required to play Gregtech.

There is no need to hate on mods. Some people may think that Tinker's Construct is OP for the costs involved. If so, and those people are welcome to *not* use Gregtech.

**On mDiyo reverting the wooden planks change:** A player who signs up for Gregtech is a player who knows that things are going to be harder and that more tools and infrastructure are going to be required to do well. If that player is okay with that

**On Greg's retaliation:** It's not okay to hamper the experience of players who just happen to want to play Minecraft with both Tinker's Construct and Gregtech installed

We've had this in the past. We don't need it. Mods exist to contribute a unique experience that wasn't there before in Minecraft. Let players build their own experience with the mods they want. mDiyo, if somebody wants world-devouring hammers built from ardite, redstone, and circuitry, by all means let that mods function alongside yours.

**I'm not the only one who is sick and tired.** RedPower delays, Gregtech and the nether drama, Gregtech v. Tinker's Construct, Forestry world-destroying bees... It needs to stop.

Modders need to drop their egos and look at people like power crystals or jakj. power crystals lets any modpack use his mod, links to contacting him and the IRC he frequents, a small, unobtrusive donation link, and he doesn't even route you through AdFly to download his mods. Jakj has created an interesting competitor to Soul Shards designed to provide an alternate means that doesn't require grinding, and a feature-rich alternative to RedPower frames. Both are free to download, fork from, direct download

**TL;DR:** I'd rather you read it, this shit has happened before, modders need to stop and let players play mods how they want to play, people need to be more like jakj and powercrystals and not behave the way Greg and mDiyo did.

Edit - PS: If you, can you not ruin the game for innocent players and instead do something harmless like the Pumpkin of Shame? I'd rather see a prank war between modders doing things like the Pumpkin instead of crashing because I had two mods that intentionally hate each other installed.

Edit 2 - Didn't expect this thread to balloon as quickly as it did, but to point out that situations like mDiyo v. Greg happen all too often. My apologies if the OP offended anyone through that.",,False,self,t5_2v620,1374074795.0,,

This is a large wall of text

First, etc.) Most people already know about the first feature, but the second might blow some minds.

* Left click a question mark to show an overlay of the recipe on the gui.
* Shift-left click the question mark in a crafting table

In the spirit of the IC wiki

Next

* Left click any item or subset to make it shown.
* Right click any item or subset to make it hidden.
* Double-left click any item or subset to show only that.
* Shift-right click any subset to search for items of that subset (uses the search bar; doesn't actually change your shown/hidden items).
* The Mod subset includes subsets of all mod items sorted by mod.
* The Creative tabs subset has each creative mode tab in its own subset. (Functionally similar to the Mod subset, and lacks some mod subsets.)

The scrolling is a bit wonky sometimes

Now

* Left click an empty slot to save the current config.
* Left click a saved config to use it.
* Right click any slot to rename it.
* Left click the X next to a saved config to delete it.

Honestly, some of the items tend not to save their hidden/shown state too well. I haven't figured out a good way to deal with this yet, other than ""Don't look directly at the bugs!""

The rest of these are miscellaneous features in no particular order. I've bolded the relevant actions to make this slightly easier to read. I have no idea if it helps.

* Press **Backspace** (can be rebound under NEI options&gt;controls) to go back a recipe.
* If the item switching in recipes starts giving you a headache
* In the NEI options menu
* **Right click** the output while crafting to pick up as many of the result as you can. (It's like shift clicking
* Hold **Q and click** on an item in an inventory to drop the item on the floor. (Inventory tweaks has the same action bound to the same shortcut.)
* **Scroll up** while hovering over an item in an inventory to effectively shift click one item at a time. (This is so much more amazing than it sounds
* **Scroll down** while hovering over an item in an inventory to fill it with an item from another inventory. (If you have planks in your inventory but need a couple more, and scroll down! Fumbling with left and right clicks is for noobs!)
* When you place an item into an inventory, left click to place item into another inventory. All of that type of item from the first inventory will move into the second one. This doesn't work if you place the item into the same inventory that you took it out of. Inventory Tweaks has a similar function that works better (when it does work; some of the shortcuts are a bit buggy atm.), and the newest update of the Mindcrack pack has InvTweaks, so I don't think this is too useful.)
* **Double click** the search bar at the bottom to search inventories as well as the items pane. Yellow searches inventories as well as the items pane on the right, HAYO!)
* **Right click** the search bar at the bottom to clear it and select it. (Almost infinitely faster than spamming backspace.)
* You can use regex in the NEI search. Except nobody seems to actually know what regex is, and [here](http://www.regular-expressions.info/)'s another. 
* Under NEI options&gt;NEIPlugins options&gt;Tooltip options
* Press **page up/down** (can be rebound) or use the **scroll wheel** if you're tired of clicking the Next and Previous buttons on the item panel. (The scrolling only works if your cursor is over the item panel.)

The scrolling directions when you hover over items can be a bit unintuitive, the scrolling thing only works if NEI is shown and enabled. Not an issue if you constantly have NEI shown and enabled, as most of the Mindcrackers do. All the other shortcuts work fine though. (I'm fairly certain there's only five other people who actually know about/use the scrolling, so it's doesn't have that high of a priority as far as the bugs list goes. It's my favorite feature of the mod though, other than maybe creative+ (which doesn't matter if you're playing survival).)

If you like these sort of small time-saving tweaks

Also, if you have two stacks of 1 cobble and a stack of 64, you'll end up with 3 stacks of 22 cobble. It's amazingly useful if your recipe involves an odd number (ie not a power of 2) of an item.)

Each age has a stability score. The more negative a number is, the more stability will be added.  
When you're writing an age

| Symbol | Stability |
|-----|-----|
| Dense Ores | -650 |
| Accelerated | -250 |
| Tendrils w/ ore modifier | -100 |
| Charged | +25 |
| Explosions | +25 |
| Scorched | +75 |
| Meteors | +125 |

When I say ""Tendrils with ore modifier"", etc. Tendrils alone doesn't affect stability. It is unknown what modifiers on tendrils add instability, but I would guess that it's just ores. Things like netherrack or glass should be fine.  
For the positive symbols (Charged, and Meteors), I'm pretty sure the stability will be added for the first three times you include a symbol. After that, no stability will be added. For the negative symbols (Dense Ores and Accelerated), the instability is added for each time you write the symbol into the age. I don't know if the effects of these symbols stack though.

Unfortunately

| Error | Stability |
|-----|-----|
| Extra Biome Controller | -200 |
| Extra Sun | -100 |
| Extra Moon | -100 |
| Extra Biome | -100 |
| Missing Biome Controller | -50 |
| Missing Sun | -25 |
| Missing Moon | -25 |
| Missing Biome | -25 |

This is all you can affect when you're writing the age. It is unknown if this also applies to completely blank ages.

Now that you have this stability score, only their thresholds.

| Instability | Threshold |
|-----|-----|
| White Decay | -1000 |
| Black Decay | -700 |
| Meteors | -525 |
| Crumble | -500 |
| Blue Decay | -400 |
| Purple Decay | -400 | 
| Blindness | -375 |
| Volcano | -375 |
| Green Decay | -300 |
| Erosion | -300 |
| Explosion | -300 |
| Scorched | -225 |
| Red Decay | -200 |
| Hunger | -150 |
| Poison | -150 |
| Confusion | -75 |
| Enemy Regen | NULL |
| Fatigue | NULL |
| Lightning | NULL |
| Slow | NULL |
| Weakness | NULL |

Here is where we get into a bit of speculation. For all of these NULL values, each effect that is generated for your age adds to its stability. This means that just because your stability is -1000, you won't get every bad effect. 

| Effect | Stability |
|-----|-----|
| White Decay | +750 |
| Black Decay | +500 |
| Meteors | +375 |
| Blue Decay | +300 |
| Green Decay | +300 |
| Purple Decay| +300 |
| Red Decay | +300 |
| Blindness | +250 |
| Crumble | +250 |
| Volcano | +225 |
| Hunger | +150 |
| Poison | +150 |
| Scorched | +150 |
| Fatigue | +125 |
| Erosion | +100 |
| Confusion | +75 |
| Enemy Regen | +75 |
| Lightning | +75 |
| Slow | +75 |
| Weakness | +75 |
| Explosion | +50 |

1372170488.0,1h1eh0,Mystcraft lesser known random facts,Rseding91,244,28,32,"I tried to find this information for a few days but I got nothing. So






To start with: **What does ""Dense Ores"" actually DO?**




Once per chunk generation per dense ores page:

* 10 extra iron/coal clusters between 0-128

* 4 extra gold clusters between 0-42

* 6 extra redstone clusters between 0-21

* 4 extra diamond clusters between 0-21

* 4 extra lapis clusters between 0-21



* Clusters will not generate in mid air meaning not all randomly generated clusters will actually be generated

* Unless a mod specifically tells Mystcraft to make Dense Ores effect its ore generation it will not effect it




Secondly: **How do instabilities work?**




Instabilities will never be added to the list of available random instabilities an age might have if the age instability is below their level to begin with:


* blindness = 375

* confusion = 300

* crumble = 500

* decayBlack = 700

* decayBlue = 400

* decayGreen = 400

* decayPurple = 400

* decayRed = 400

* decayWhite = 1000

* enemyregen = 0

* erosion = 300

* explosion = 300

* fatigue = 0

* hunger = 150

* lightning = 0

* meteors = 525

* poison = 150

* scorched = 225

* slow = 0

* volcano = 375

* weakness = 0






**The limits of specific instabilities that can automatically be added to an age from the weighted list are:**




* Blindness: 1

* Confusion: 1

* Crumble: 20

* All decay: unlimited

* Enemy Regeneration: 10

* Erosion: 2

* Explosions: 20

* Fatigue: 8

* Hunger: 8

* Lightning: 20

* Meteors: unlimited

* Poison: 10

* Scorched earth: 2

* Slowness: 9

* Volcano: 3

* Weakness: 10




**When manually adding instability symbols to an age they will only help so much. After that the stability effects no longer apply (however the instability effects will keep stacking past the automatically-added instability limits of that symbol).**




Those limits are:




* Explosions: 3

* Charged: 3

* Meteors: 3

* Scorched: 3




Adding specific pages causes instability:




* Dense Ores adds 600 instability per page.

* Accelerated adds 250 instability per page.

* Altering tendrils with blocks (Diamonds/Gold/etc.). Adds 10 times the instability factor of what you made them out of (factors listed below).

* Altering the terrain or ocean with blocks (Lava/Oil/End Stone/etc.). Adds 100 times the instability factor of what you made them out of (factors listed below). It should be noted that in vanilla Mystcraft there are no blocks that add instability that can also be used to replace terrain so this only applies for oil right now.




Block replacement instability factors:



* diamond = 100

* gold = 80

* iron = 50

* coal = 10

* oil = 5

* everything else = 0





**Some pages if added too many times will cause instability:**



* Crystals: 3

* Glowstone Crystals: 3

* Tendrils: 10

* Strongholds: 3

* Dungeons: 3

* Mineshafts: 3

* NetherFort: 3

* Obelisks: 8

* Villages: 3


**When a instability is -automatically- enabled in an age it removes some of that numbered instability from the total using these numbers:**



* blindness = 250

* confusion = 75

* crumble = 250

* decayBlack = 500

* decayBlue = 300

* decayGreen = 300

* decayPurple = 300

* decayRed = 300

* decayWhite = 750

* enemyregen = 75

* erosion = 100

* explosion = 50

* fatigue = 125

* hunger = 150

* lightning = 75

* meteors = 375

* poison = 150

* scorched = 150

* slow = 75

* weakness = 75

* volcano = 225




**When the 4 instability symbols are added as pages (Explosions, Scorched) they reduce instability by these amounts (referencing the list above) per page up to the limit listed above:**



* lightning / 3

* meteors / 3

* explosion / 2

* scorched / 2



That means that charged removes 75/3 or 25 instability from an age when added manually.



That also means that with 1 dense ores page, scorched earth again...)




Thirdly: **symbol count has zero effect on age stability as long as you meet the required symbols in the required order and don't exceed the limit of a given page.**




If there's anything I missed or if someone wants to know something else about Mystcraft just let me know and I'll do my best to answer it.

First:
If someone brings up the words Tekkit and/or Technic, the past's the past lets leave it like that. 


Second:
Any attack on a LP'er/streamer is apparently an attack on the whole subreddit. Some people take their mc too seriously and can't stand it when other members point out flaws and errors that a lper/streamer does. Majority of these people have received a God status on this sub and are hailed above anyone else. When I see posts for good Lp's instead of comments that can give good feedback


Third:
Downvotes for an unpopular opinion. I have seen many comments where people are downvoted for an unpopular opinion. This is NOT what you downvote for; however


Lastly:
FTB IMHO has turned into a tekkit classic kinda thing. What i mean is that the collection of modpacks are really the only reason people still play 1.4.7. This contradicts FTB's philosophy of being first to update. The youtubers are still playing 1.4 and encouraging people to stay until 1.6 which is retarded. TechnicTeam dropped a 1.5 pack just recently and guess whats its pretty awesome. Slowpoke said yesterday about a 1.5 beta pack which has been ""in the making"" for sooo long now. Idk what took them so long, but that was like after a couple weeks)


~~Also as said above FTB used to look toward the future and yet now they are encouraging players to stay an mc version behind and all the youtubers are doing the same.~~ (Edit: Repetitive) 

In addition the ForgeCraft peeps have basically turned into what I call the Forge Goons. Why? Well they get to test mods before us and are playing beta versions on 1.5 while we are still playing 1.4. (Understandable to some degree since they are famous and it helps promote the Mod)This forces us to watch their content because they are the main source for new updates. If you really want your mod to excel post it publicly and let us beta test rather than a closed group of tubers/streamers who from recent videos look like they are just in it for the money. I rather play a new buggy beta with new content rather than an old version. (Edit: Yes i would report bugs


I know a bunch of this prolly sounds retarded

P.S. If forge had a central Repo (like DevBukkit) and a main launcher we wouldn't need FTB, 
etc. We would/could be just one giant Forge Community instead of being limited by popular Mod Packs and hating each other.

Since I am about to start a new world on a small server (most likely a tweaked Ultimate)


* IC2: [Rubber Boots](http://wiki.industrial-craft.net/index.php?title=Rubber_Boots)
As mentioned

* Factorization: [Barrels](http://ftbwiki.org/Barrel)
Make 3 or 4 of them and store your most common Materials in them. They will save you a lot of time until you get a proper Sorting System going.

* IC2: [Scaffolds](http://wiki.industrial-craft.net/index.php?title=Scaffold)
They are extremly cheap to make and can be reinforced to remove the building limitations. Plus free ladders.

* Redpower2: [Canvas Bag](http://ftbwiki.org/Canvas_Bag)
They require a lot of String to craft

* Redpower2: [Project Tables](http://ftbwiki.org/Project_Table)
There is nothing more annoying than putting most of a recipe in

* Factorization: [Pocket Crafting Table](http://ftbwiki.org/Pocket_Crafting_Table)
A crafting Table on the go. Nothing less. (thx grey_lollipop)

* Equivalent Exchange 3: [Minium Stone](http://ftbwiki.org/Minium_Stone)
The Minium Stone can convert many Blocks into others and additionally serves as a portable crafting table. But it requires gold and some monster drops. (thx LRafols)

* Applied Energistics: [Quartz Grind Stone](http://ftbwiki.org/Quartz_Grind_Stone)
It works like a Macerator but is driven by hand and crafted with just Stone

* IC2: [Bronze Armor](http://wiki.industrial-craft.net/index.php?title=Bronze_Chestplate)
Almost as good as diamond

* Redpower2: [Sickle](http://ftbwiki.org/Sickle)
Removes Grass in a 5x5 and Leaves in a 3x3 space

* Portalgun Gun Mod: [Weighted Companion Cube](http://ftbwiki.org/Weighted_Companion_Cube)
Heals 1 heart every 5 seconds regardless of food. Great for staying alive early game. (thx osand317)

* Forestry: [Miners](http://ftbwiki.org/Miner%27s_Backpack) and [Diggers Backpack](http://ftbwiki.org/Digger%27s_Backpack)
A must for any serious mining expeditions. (thx Juice573)

* Computercraft: [Miningt Turtle](http://ftbwiki.org/Mining_Turtle)
Requires some LUA knowledge and either diamonds or gems
EDIT: Apparently you can go without LUA: [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/1ar80o/often_forgotten_early_game_items_that_would_make/c901qac) is more from Bockit.

* GregTech: [Flint Mortar](http://gregtech-addon.wikispaces.com/Flint+Mortar)
Single use Pulverizer

* Redpower2: [Athame](http://ftbwiki.org/Athame)
A ritual Dagger crafted from a Stick and a single piece of Silver

* BiblioCraft: [Tape Measure](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1680480-15x-147forgesmp-bibliocraft-v115-v112-bookcases-armor-stands-shelves-and-more-updated-03212013/)
Tape measure is good for measuring distances. Won't save your life but it's nice to have. (thx no-longer-inadequate)

* Railcraft: [Coke Oven](http://ftbwiki.org/Coke_Oven)
It requires a lot os Sand and Bricks

* IC2: [Iron Furnace](http://ftbwiki.org/Iron_Furnace)
More costefficient and a bit faster for only a regular furnace and 5 Iron Ingots? Sounds like a plan. (thx TheEternallyRustled)

* Vanilla: Bucket with Water.
No seriously

Back in Technic, a macerator? A bit of copper? It was nothing. And speaking of which, the macerator, a machine that doubles all your ores, took some flint and iron. Again, that's nothing.

I love the feeling I got when I blasted those silicon plates to make my first solar panel, and it was thrilling building, and subsequently upgrading, my industrial blast furnace, because it held weight. It meant something. 

Gregtech was the best thing to happen to Industrialcraft since Industrialcraft 2.

Just wanted to give everyone a heads up here on a bug which I apparently introduced in the 2.2.1 update and is probably causing a lot of issues

Basically, if you connect Liquiducts directly to a BC pump, OR a tesseract bridge which is directly connected to a BC pump, you are going to lose a LOT of liquid.

A temporary fix for this is to do pump -&gt; BC pipe -&gt; Tesseract bridge -&gt; Liquiduct.

We will hopefully have this fixed ASAP along with some other bug fixes and performance improvements. Really sorry about this one.",self,t5_2v620,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/18ypc5/psa_confirmed_liquiduct_bug_my_bad/

I wanted to take the chance to introduce the community to a mod I recently began developing called Liquid Dynamics. Its goal: To turn water into a viable resource for construction, I would like to take the chance now to ask the community for what they would like to see added to the mod, or have the mod address gameplay-wise. To keep this simple, here are a few of the things that will definitely be happening:

* Living in a ocean biome will be completely viable. Ocean biomes will no longer be useless

* Realistic coral reefs will be implemented. The ocean floors will be dotted with coral of all colors

* Water will no longer be a secondary resource. Instead, can be used for piping, construction, weaponry, and more. 

* A unique power system involving water will be implemented. While the details of this are not definite, I will implement a power conversion system, either through Power Converters, or something native.

I am aware that some of these ideas do not sound completely fleshed out, versus one person's opinion on what the ""best"" is. Keep in mind though that the overall feel for this mod should blend eco-friendly practices in with technological advancement. The idea would be a civilation that, when faced with extinction, used the natural environment around them to survive, while ensuring it would exist in the future rather than be overused.

**Machines:**
Things like Fusion Reactors, and perhaps a in-house power unit.

**Armor**
 We would have 3 or more armor sets that I planned so far. 

**Materials**
My mod would use common sense, and Tungsten are some primary materials, but more will be added and thought up.

**Power**
I spoke about this promptly above, we will have plasma generation, thermal generation, solar, eolian, hydro(this will play a much larger role than IC2 watermills, because where I live, Fission and Fusion power gen(based on the real life processes

All the power (except solar) would be focused around a turbine of sorts. For example; water would spin a turbine


So that's a simple run down of what I have planned/coded. A beta will be up soon! If you have any suggestions, so If you're interested, PM me!

So last night I was sitting around chatting to a few people about various things when something dawned on me. After some quick verification it turned out that today is the first anniversary of the birth of FTB.

Twelve Months ago a group of us sat around in the Direwolf20 IRC channel just chilling and chatting with not a lot planned for the weekend. In order to help pass the time I came up with an idea to have a race against one of the other Direwolf20 Admins (aka Nishtown) to see who could built 10 items from various mods the quickest. Honestly when compiling the list, we finished within 20 minutes of each other.

We had enough fun that weekend that the following weekend we did something similar

The youtube series was a huge success

However we havent even come close to finishing yet. Plans are already in place for the future. Work has already started on the next generation of FTB maps. In a couple of months we will have a group of FTB staff getting together at Pax East where we plan to host an open FTB server and an Official FTB Tournament hosted by the Pax East team. We still have more official packs that will be released once the necessary mods have been completed and some other stuff behind the scenes that we will talk about in the future.

I want to finish this post by doing what people normally do at times like this, Launcher Team, Pack Team, Map Builders, Forum Moderators and many many more people, I wouldn't even want to guess how many people that is. Well over a hundred though at a guess. Of course I have to thank everyone who uses the FTB launcher and have played the maps. We haven't always gotten things right, but we have always tried to do our best and no matter what

**p.s.For anyone still reading this long post, this is purely for fun.) Everyone is invited to join in over the weekend. A section in the forums will be opened up where you can link streams or youtube videos of your attempts or if you want just post screenshots of your progress through the challenges. I am sure along the way we will be joined by all sorts of people stopping by to say hello etc, so feel free to join in.** 

Thanks

Slowpoke.

1360860066.0,18ish5,Redpower Sorting and You. A text guide to using Pneumatic Tubes.,BuccaneerRex,117,13,48,"Redpower Sorting and you!

[Check the other thread with a link to the IMGUR album!](http://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/18k6nl/redpower_sorting_now_with_pictures/)

This is a basic text guide to Redpower sorting in FTB. ~~I'll add pictures later.~~ I'm discussing IC2 machines here

The place to start is your input chest. You dump everything to be sorted here. I use an enderchest so I can access it with an enderpouch from anywhere. Helps keep my inventory clean. Use a sorting machine to pull from the enderchest.

Your sorter settings should be auto pull, it goes to the macerator, and if I dump raw porkchops, they go to the furnace. You'll want to use the mode with a default color, I use black. That means anything that isn't specifically marked with a color will be marked black and dumped into the network.

I also put all the dusts in the sorter and mark them red as well. If you're worried about getting the weird ingot versions

Now you need to paint your tubes. IC2 machines are fed from the top when using redpower, to make it easy to mass produce some of the more advanced items. Just be sure to mark the items and colors in your sorter.

Now you need to pull items back out of your machines. With redpower, and you can put items inside to specify what they take. Empty filters accept everything. Filters also allow you to mark them with colors.

Retrievers will pull items from any inventory on the connected network. THey're like a remote filter. If you put items inside, downside is that it always pulls from the nearest inventory first. So if you have a setup with several machines running very fast, the machines farther down the network won't be pulled from until the first machine is empty. 

Filters are relatively cheap

Now, and keep your network structure in mind, you'll see how powerful they can be.

An item can be pushed into a tube, but will never enter a tube of a different color even if the system is overfilled. Uncolored items can go wherever they want, so if you are using colors in your system, it's important to keep that in mind. 

The next thing to know about tubes is that each set of tubes that are connected to eachother is its own network. If you have five tubes, you have 2 separate networks. This is important because retrievers and managers can only pull from their same network, and won't pull 'through' another machine. Machines in between networks also strip colors off items. Finally, you can re-use colors as long as they're on separate networks. 

Machines can be placed next to inventories, can paint, and they can selectively request items. (they can also pull EVERYTHING. Don't hook up a retriever to a clock signal with nothing inside it. It will try and empty every chest on the input side of the network!)

Finally, even if there's empty inventories waiting on the other side. They can also be painted, for more control options. Restriction tubes can also be stacked, so you could have multiple stages of last resort, for example 1 restrictor in front of your recycler, and 2 restrictors leading to the trash. So it will try to place cobble (for example) somewhere in the network, but if no available slots can be found, then it will send it to the trash.

If you want to keep tubes from connecting to eachother, painted tube only connect to the same color or to blank tubes. 

So now we're pulling items out of your machines. Like I said, and pull from the front. You can run redwire over the top of the filters, or you can use redstone tubes.

Since we're pulling items that may or may not be finished, they should ignore the distance calculation and head for your input chest. 

You might ask why I don't output from macerators directly into the furnaces. Because not everything that gets macerated needs to be smelted. By sending it back to be re-sorted

So from your processing unit, but we don't want to mark them out for special treatment, so the sorter will use the default color and mark them black, and dump them out into the network.

Now you have to decide how you want to store items. Chests or barrels? Barrels are the easier option
They only accept one type of item, which can clog up your system.

Chests are a more powerful option

This is where the fact that each network is separate comes in handy. I like to send all black painted items through a series of sorters. Each sorter can mark up to 8 colors + a default. So you can put up to 8 chests per sorter, repeat. I like to reduce this and use 6 chests per sorter, since that allows you to have more than 1 column of five items per chest. If you are flush with resources, you can use the entire inventory of the sorter for one color, which is awesome for sorting all common items from a given mod into a single chest, or group of chests.

Now, and everything you wanted marked and stuffed into a chest or barrel will be stored. But you will still have some items left over. We don't have the time or energy to mark every possible item, and RP does mark a difference between the same items with damage. 

This is where the overflow chest comes in. Your over flow chest is anything that you want to dump unsorted or overflow items into. It should have a restriction tube on it

If you've been following along, that can be a problem. I like to have relief valves on each subnetwork, usually a couple of restriction tubes that are unmarked, or an item detector and transposer. (item detectors can be set to emit a redstone signal if their output network is overfilled. So you can use this with a NOT gate to trigger a transposer to open and provide an alternate path.

I hope this clears up some of the confusion people have about using redpower tubes and machines. I'll put some pictures together

Happy sorting!

## Which FTB pack do I choose?

In Technic land, the direwolf20 pack, the beta pack, the retro pack and the magic pack.

### Which packs shouldn't you start with right now?

* The retro pack is for 1.2.5 and exists so that people can play the old FTB map. It can be ignored.
* The beta pack was the first pack out for the launcher. It will be replaced by a tech pack eventually. It's still in 1.4.2
* The magic pack filled two purposes - first it was a pack for 1.4.5 while the beta pack couldn't update, leaving the magic pack somewhat redundant.

### Choices

This leaves two choices - the direwolf20 pack and the Mindcrack pack. These modpacks are both for 1.4.6, depending on what you want. They have slightly different sets of mods included and Reddit user Kghareus did up [a diagram to compare them](http://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/15cwpn/ftb_146_pack_comparison/c7lif9y).

The short of it is that the Mindcrack pack is harder

## Why can't I craft [IC2 ITEM X]?

If it's related to Nuclear Reactors

Otherwise, which run off Buildcraft power. The Powered Furnace is exactly what it says on the tin, and the Pulverizer works like a macerator.

## Why aren't my redstone engines working?

In the new version of Buildcraft, and wooden waterproof pipes. This was because the Buildcraft maintainers didn't like that people were powering quarries with stacks of redstone engines for basically free power.

## Where is Redpower 2?

Redpower 2 is only in the direwolf20 and Mindcrack packs. It was not updated in time for the beta or magic packs.

## What happened to EE?

The maintainer of EE, it is not included in most packs. It is in the direwolf20 pack only. Collectors, Red Matter, and the power tools (like the destruction catalyst) are removed for good. The Energy Condenser has a replacement planned, but will probably require more maintenance.

## Can I convert my Technic/Tekkit world?

While theoretically possible for someone to write a converter

## Where is the wiki?

At the moment there are two wikis. The [official wiki](http://wiki.feed-the-beast.net), but keep in mind that Gregtech may change things if hard mode is on, so double check against NEI.

## What is up with the Rotary Macerator/other advanced machines?

There are two versions of Advanced Machines - AtomicStryker's and Snyke's. Technic has always used Snyke's, uses 1 EU/t when idling, 16 when active. AtomicStryker's version is initially slower and only takes LV but can be upgraded to be even faster. However, it had some bugs in the 1.4.2 version which could crash servers, and also had issues with using too much power when upgraded, so it's not in any of the newer packs yet. The FTB devs prefer AtomicStryker's though, so if either gets added again

## What mods are not there that were in Technic or Tekkit?

* Equivalent Exchange 2 (EE3 is in the direwolf20 pack)
* Thaumcraft 2 (TC3 is in some packs
* Advanced Machines
* Nether Ores
* Power Converters (use the forestry electrical engine for EU -&gt; MJ)
* Treecapitator
* Optifine
* Matmos

## What mods in FTB were not in Technic or Tekkit?

* Thaumcraft 3 (Technic had TC2)
* Forestry (was in much older versions of Technic
* Factorisation (check out the barrels for cheap ways of storing large amounts of cobble)
* Thermal Expansion (some later versions of Technic had it)
* GregTech
* Soul Shards
* Extra Biomes XL
* Gravisuite
* Xycraft
* Twilight Forest",self,t5_2v620,1369858110.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/15jeqr/faq_for_technictekkit_players/
1353427429.0,13ihp7,FEED THE BEAST TIPS!,daebat,116,13,102,"Here are my tips from playing FTB so far:

On my server we've added a mining world and a sand world.  This avoids tearing up all of the land around your living space and causes much less of a problem with other people.

LinkBooks are f'ing great.  Once you've created a mine or quarry or if you just want to have a way to get somewhere quickly

Solar power is over rated and overly expensive... set up a pump in the nether and use geothermal!  It's cheap and very efficient.  

Turtles.  I made six of these and have just been raping level 12 in my mine world.  It cost about 1-2 coal for one turtle to tunnel a 3x2x50 hole.  Set up six and you've got yourself a lot of ore.  This also creates a great place for slime to spawn = railcraft eventually!

Void pipes.  If you do set up a quarry just pump the cobble and dirt into void pipes.  This will avoid issues with overflowing chests and such.  

Portal Guns! They're cheap and they're very obviously the best way to get around in the nether pre-jetpack.  Even with jetpack they're a little safer. 

~~Crates~~ Barrels.  These hold 64 stacks of 64 items so if you do plan on holding onto all of that cobble, this is a great way to store them efficiently and it looks pretty cool too.  

Find a damn town!  Why mess with tracking down food when you can just find an NPC village and exploit all of their hard work?  They've also got apiaries which allow for the production of bees (and apiaries are expensive!)... also

Twighlight forest.  While dangerous it is very lucrative to find strongholds and mazes.  They hold many many chests and lots of good stuff come out of them.  Just be careful not to die.

Waypoints!  If you've never used Rei's before

Feeders: we all know everybody is going to kill off the cows in your settling area quickly to make books and get steak so put together a feeder (they're relatively cheap) and let it induce those sweet

No Fall Damage Portal Boots - don't leave home without them!  If you have a jetpack or portal gun

Also notables:

Water Mills for when you don't have much of anything can be a good source of power.

Rotary Macerator &amp; Industrial Furnace for once you've got a good mine going.  Save up all of your ores and then blast through them all at once using these powerful machines.  

Aerial Faith Plates are really cheap and fun to play around with.  Just make sure you have your portal boots on!

**EDIT: MORE TIPS!**

Obsidian Pressure Plates allow for only players to activate therefore you can place them outside without the worry of chickens or zombies setting them off. 

With the portal gun you can use 'G' to turn on gravity mode allowing for you to pick up blocks... including spawners.  I have a mob grinder set up on my server with three spawners inside.  A lot of xp and loot.

~~Working on improving these configs during the day.~~ No known bugs atm


Original Version
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7011174/GregUnleashed.zip


Updated Version for those following the Unleashed pack 

~~https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7011174/GregUnleashedv1.1.2.zip~~

**https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7011174/GregUnleashedv1.1.3.zip**


Goal is to make most mods set to ""hardest"" difficulty possible.

~~Edit 1. Runs atm with BiomesOp disabled.~~

Edit 2. Should work with BiomesOP and all enabled mods from both packs by default.

Edit 3. Dimensional Doors and Underground biomes should work if enabled.

~~Edit 4. Updated Gregtech config to reflect changes to FTB Unhinged pack.~~ ~~Still Working on it. Fix seems to have been a hit and miss from me.~~

Edit 5. All reported bugs should be gone now. Renamed the zip to show thats its another change. If you weren't using BiomesOP just ignore the change. Enjoy until the next bug :p

Edit 6. Added Ars Magica. ~~Default setting since I'm unfamiliar with this mod and don't use it myself.~~

Edit 7. Updated to reflect changes to Unleashed. ~~Unable to fix the Arsmagica bugs with combination of Forestry items.~~ ~~Would only recommend using one version of MFFS since they have some conflicting item id's. Unchanged on purpose to prevent destroying setups in existing worlds.~~

Edit 8. Fixed Ars Magica conflicting item ids. Fix and solution from u/Zuvuxyy and reported by u/barkingnoise.

Edit 9. Updated to be compatible with Unleashed v1.1.2. Both MFFR packs are able to run together now. Tested with all mods from Unleashed+Unhinged enabled and disabled ones.

~~Added a github for the configs. Started working on v1.1.3 and will publish it here asap its released.~~

**Github for future refrence is at https://github.com/Landrash/GregUnleashed**

Sure gregtech is an awesome mod, Electrum, not ores, but the basic building blocks of all machinery ) and so does the electrolyzer. Other machinery are often there to satisfy the communal desires for late game machinery.

But what makes gregtech shine is that it literally forces you to learn about other mods. It forces you to get into bees, set up a lava pump, creating humongous biofuel farms, etc.

It is a mod that makes you explore the whole modpack. And if you don't

What I'm trying to say is the following: Gregtech depends on other mods to supply it with primary goods.

A good example would be the matter fabricator. I needed a huge amount of power for it. I've always wanted to do something with the distil tower. I used a **Steve's Cart** treefarm, **Redpower II** to transport the items long distances without using tons of gold and for the ease of use, **Forestry** fermenters to convert it to distillable biomass, **Gregtech** distil tower to convert it into biofuel, **Thermal Expansion** item tesseracts to transport them to **Factorization** routers, **Buildcraft** combustion engines also fueled by **Thermal Expansion** Aqueous Accumulators to **Minefactory Power converters** directly into the **Gregtech** matter fabricator.

That's 10 different mods used to power a matter fab through mother nature.

Would I have made such things without gregtech? Lol no. There's simply no need for it.

TL;DR Gregtech shines in forcing you to learn about other mods and be creative how to make them interact to gain the lategame items/machinery. This is also the reason why I truly despise the new changes. Can't we all be friends and not make the modding a warzone?

They put A LOT of work into making the packs we use they code launchers put packs together get working config even support their packs and by sometimes even the mods within them.  If you watch Direwolf's videos you could here the exhaustion in his(slowpokes) voice they wouldn't talk about it on camera and I respect that but you could actually hear it had taken its toll on the him and I'm guessing the whole team.

Its hard when you put a lot of time and love into a project and some stupid fight makes all that more difficult I even have to give a lot of props for how they handled it so quickly and it seems amicably.

However you feel about whats in it I'm guessing a majority of the subscribers use the FTBs pack and we owe them many thanks.

I use the FTB packs because I run my own server that I have 1 or 2 friends rarely log in but I mostly play with my much much younger nephews in different states the FTB pack has freed up what the last time I hosted turned into a VERY large job to help my family install and then later update countless mods.  Now I send out a link to the FTB downloader and a link to my host IP and go back to playing I would not be able to do this without the dedication of the FTB team to making a smooth experience both client and server side with tested and pre-configured packs.

Also a big thank you for all the mod developers to the awesome work so the FTB team had things to include in the packs.

With the high sappiness each sapling gives 2.5 buckets of biomass when fermented with fruit juice.  Combined with the high fruit yield and high sapling drop rate I get around 15-20 saplings per tree and 50+ apples per tree.  The tree also has the fastest maturation rate.

Each one has the potential of generating 2million EU from this very simple setup.,Plornt,104,17,41,"I found myself filtering out the forcicium from my RP2 tunnel bore as I had gotten too much. I went to find out what it was used for and found it was for the force field system which in itself is pretty cool but as I am not on a PVP server

So today I watch direwolfs spotlight and found out about the MFFS Converter and did a bit of testing and you end up with a net gain of about 250k EU per forcicium (8 per macerated ore). 

This is a quick test setup:
http://i.imgur.com/Quzbf.jpg

What you need:

* 2 x MFFS Card &lt;Blank&gt;
* 1 x MFFS Extractor (far left on image)
* 1 x MFFS Capacitor (Middle Left)
* 1 x MFFS Converter (Middle Right)
* 1 x MFSU
* 1 x Lever


4 x Optic Fibre Cable (or similar). (technically you dont have to use any as MFFS is all ""wireless"")


1. Place them however you like but make sure to put the MFSU next to the MFFS Converter. 

2. Right click the converter and change it to 512 EU output and turn on the switch. 

3. Right click the capacitor twice with the two blank cards and then place one into the converter and one into the extractor.

4. Place your forcicium into the extractor. 

5. Seed the MFSU with about 10k EU from a power source (ie Lappack) 

6. Watch the power roll in.


Now what you can do is make even more of these extractors and link them to the capacitor to generate EU even faster. I have another setup that has generated over 100million EU within the last 20 mins and each one still has over 50 forcicium in them... http://i.imgur.com/IwwW9.png

I am not going to discuss whether it is good or bad (well, chances are you know more than me.

A short introduction of my ftb experience: I started playing the beta pack ~6 months ago, get some thermal expansion machine, now having hell lot of fun in Gregtech. So far I only touched some mid-tier Gregtech machines so my advice will be solely on how to get started.

Before going into Gregtech. I would assume you have some basic machine setup and resources. If you are starting brand new

Key resources you will need (in the order):

* Iron

YES! Iron is the material you will most likely run out of. In fact, but assuming you have a pulverizer/macerator already, that is around a stack and a half of iron ore. This is not that a big leap from other mod, say thaumcraft (you will need many resources for research), forestry (bronze anyone?). 

* Rubber and copper

Surprisingly, or 0.75 for each advanced circuit. **A stack or so of copper and rubber** will be sufficient for most cases. A few rubber sapling (exploration in swamp/forest will get enough of those) with extractor you will never run out of rubber.

* Coal

Coal is important ingredient for advanced machine block

* Charcoal

Self-explanatory. Charcoal as fuel in furnace and generator (build a few if you have spare resources

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Key machines you will need:

* IC2: Extractor (rubber), Batbox and MFE (you want 2+ MFE for most of your usage)

* TE: Pulverizer (if you do not have macerator)

* Railcraft: Rolling machine (a must if you want to have any progression)

* Redpower: Alloy furnace (Another niche that saves your copper usage! Brass uses half of copper as bronze and is a valid material for mixed metal alloy. No more copper shortage.)

* A stable supply of MJ and your awesome **OMNIWRENCH**!

Ok guys get all your things packed in a big hollow room? Time to make the very first Gregtech machine: Industrial Centrifuge.

Ind. Centrifuge is a LV machine (which means you want a batbox/LV-transformer for it) that makes many useful material. Depending on what resources you have access to

List of very very useful recipe for Ind. Centrifuge that you may want to mark it down on a paper:

* 16 Lava + 50

Infamous lava centrifuge! The new recipe takes into consideration of the cell usage means you will never lose tin for it, or your magma crucible. If you are in need of some copper/tin/electrum, turn on this baby and you are good.

* 16 Cracked Sand + 1 Fuel can + 12

No body likes wasteland right? Well not for Greg Tech folk. Cracked sand centrifuge provides the easiest access to saltpeter dust

* 8 Marble Dust -&gt; 7 Calcite Dust + 1 Magnesium Dust

Tired of a barrel of marble? Macerate and centrifuge them! you may wonder why do you need calcite dust (no one cares about the Mg you get right?), you will still be short of iron

Remember that Ind. centrifuge only takes 5 EU/t and most of the tasks are incredibly slow. If you have spare resources you may want to get a few of them.

Next machine to be introduced is Industrial Blast Furnace. ""But hey

edit: Centrifuging Lava and Lava cells yields the same amount of resources in latest patch. Centrifuging lava cell takes 50% more EU though

Another redditor posted a while back suggesting that FTB should have an open-source pack

This situation with Redpower is sometimes referred to by developers as the bus factor (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor). Basically, your health, boredom etc. It's a real problem, not just here within our community but in software projects everywhere.

This got me thinking that FTB might benefit from taking the open-source idea one step further. What if FTB had a mod pack that was made up of just one open-source mod worked on by a team of developers? So rather than have many open-source mods worked on by individual teams in different code repositories that are then merged together

Below is a list of the pros/cons I can think of

Positives

- Reduced Bus Factor: If any member of the team gets too busy in real-life
- Balance: All aspects of the mod can be balanced by the team working together rather than individual mod developers making separate decisions.
- Consistency: The block GUIs will look the same
- Quality: With more than one set of eyes on the code, consistency and learning.
- Update Speed: When a new version of MC gets released
- Learning: Working in a team is one of the best ways to become a better developer. You also now have a team of other developers to rely on when you hit a bug or problem you can't solve. Some of the mods are created by very talented junior developers who may also benefit from working in a team environment

Negatives

- Credit: Some developers enjoy the kudos that comes from developing their own mod. That lessens when working in a team.
- Variety: Some players like that FTB has multiple power units and transport systems because it adds variety to the game.
- Missed opportunities: Large featured mods like Twilight Forest or Mystcraft may never make it in to the mod because the amazingly creative developers who come up with these types of idea may not be part of the team.
- Effort: It would be a lot of work to get the initial version up and running. The idea would be to start from scratch

There are some great examples in the software industry of this concept working well. One close to my heart is Zend Framework

Just so you know that I'm not talking completely out of my ass, I've lead small and big projects, and I've managed developers with a range of skill levels. A lot of what I've written above comes from my experiences about what has worked and what hasn't, including things I've learned from the mistakes that I've made.

TL;DR I think the FTB community could benefit from an open-source mod pack consisting of one fully featured mod worked on by a team of developers that would provide a reliable

Thoughts?

* Crystal clusters can only raise a node's vis by 10% of its max.

* Crystal clusters don't cause flux. At all. None.

* A node with more vis than its max (""overcharged"") generates flux. This is only possible via crystal clusters (capacitors won't give a node more than 100%).

* The flux generated by an overcharged node appears to be completely random

* A pure node will have absolutely no trouble keeping up with this 'overcharged' flux generation

* Unstable nodes generate every element as flux

* You can't get above 100 of any one element of flux.

* When a wisp spawns

* I have no idea how vis is made outside of crystal clusters. I can't get my end node to regenerate at all without assistance.

* Your crucible can hold 500 total essentia before it starts spilling.

* Silverwoods only need between 50-100 vis to grow. Nailing this down is difficult.

* Placing a block in the same space as a node will prevent wisps from spawning.

* Each infused ore only seems to regenerate the nearest node by 10 points before becoming depleted. They also take 10 vis to replenish themselves

* Bug? Infused ore wouldn't update graphically to dull ore without exiting and returning.

Hello FTB community.

Recently I have made some Mystcraft ages and found out that due to a bug

For instance

[I have googled around a bit](http://binarymage.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5109#p5109) and have found a workaround for this.

 

-------------------------------------------

 


Short said

I. Write your age as how you want it.  
II. Visit the age once(and notice it does not generate properly)

III. Shut down FTB and go to the corresponding DIM_MYST folder of that age in your saves folder.   
[Example](http://i.imgur.com/veFV1pS.png).

IV. In the 'region' folder

V. Start your game and enter the age again.

There is a small bug where you crash upon re-entering the game after deleting the files

 

-------------------------------------------

 





**Edit: It appears to be a bug specific to FTB and *not* Mystcraft itself. Thanks to darkinnit for mentioning this.**

1: Deep Storage Unit (Minefactory reloaded). This is a cheap item. only requires some rubber, like a quantum chest. This is good mid-early game for mob traps or to store cobblestone. Did I mention you get 4 of them?

2: Mining well.(Buildcraft) Good very early game powered by stirling engines to get a bit of mining automation. Also

3: Rubber boots.(IC2) Also good early game to negate a lot of fall damage for just some rubber and wool. They don't last very long

4: Seed bag.(Redpower) Very good if you're a farmer or you have a big farm. Sickles and seed bags are a great combo.

5: Engineers overalls:(Railcraft) Pretty sweet looking.

6: Hazmat suit.(IC2) Orange dye and rubber for lava and fire immunity. Yes please. Good for first nether trip

7: Scaffolds.(IC2) Ladders that don't rely on a block in front of them

8: Salamanders eye. (Xeno's Reliquary) It's an item that gives you full fire and lava immunity for a fairly cheap price.

**Pneumatic tubes:** They are lovely and fantastic and they ""just work"" for the most part. That very first upgrade from buildcraft pipes to pneumatic tubes was magical, and unless you want to invest in the magtube infrastructure they are quite slow. The final nail in the pneumatic tube coffin, however, is Applied Energistics. I think FTB has outgrown standard storage options, and AE is THE storage/automation mod for FTB at this point.

**Logic blocks:** I was fascinated with these when I first started playing with them, and only then if AE doesn't fit the bill. It's just... if you want to do complex automation in FTB, there's computercraft. Why redstone logic?

**Microblocks:** I love these! These would be in the missed items list if it weren't for one thing: there is an alternative that already works. Thanks Immibis!

Now for a few things that I actually WILL miss. I would love to see some replacement options for the following:

**Canvas bags:** Sure some servers won't even let you make these because of the dupe bug, to keep my personal inventory managable and clean. I will miss these dearly, and while Ender pouches and the forestry bags offer some respite from my bag-less world... they just aren't the same. Cheap, easy, effective... I will miss my canvas bags.

**Flax:** Speaking of canvas

**Project tables:** It was only recently that I realized this was actually part of the redpower mod. Sure AE has the crafting terminal

**Red alloy wire:** It just makes getting a redstone signal from point A to point B as easy as it should be

**Frames:** Yeah, frame bores, and frame ships. Such a neat and revolutionary idea, to take this otherwise rather static game and allow the creation of whole structures that MOVE. I hope someone figures this out soon.

For those who haven't heard of OpenPeripheral

The list of mods it supports is huge

However

You stick a Terminal Bridge block next to a computer

Think.. Google Glasses

It's best shown using videos:

Here's a small app monitoring IC2 energy storage units:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4xkBGyJqEU

Here's a simple arrow counter:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUNrjNkRBiY

It's brand new, making mini-maps, making game scoring systems and more. I'm excited to see what people come up with.

A powerful feature is that if you're wearing terminal glasses, if you type ""$$energy"" it could display energy readings from across your base, or if you typed ""$$stock redstone"" it could show how redstone you've got stored.

Anyway

Here are the rules:


- You start in survival mode, 140, 0) to find the descriptive age book.

- You start with in your inventory: 99 pieces of UU-matter

- You cannot use the given solar panel to other means than the matter fabricator.


- You can create Myscraft ages (the world itself was created through Mystcraft which might give you a hint on how to create other worlds). But only to the following conditions: you can only go **once** to a given world and you cannot stay more than 30 minutes in it. You can however create as many worlds as you want and keep chuncks loaded in there. Remember that getting back what you put in other worlds can be tricky given you can only go once there.

The unit of power in IC2 is the Energy Unit

Extreme low voltage is 0 to 5 eu/p. Low voltage is 5 to 32 eu/p. Medium voltage is 32 to 128 eu/p. High voltage is 128 to 512 eu/p. Extreme voltage is 512 to 2048 eu/p.

IC2 cables have a max voltage. If a packet larger than its max enters a cable

Tin cables can take extreme low voltage, glass fiber carries high, and high voltage cable can take up to extreme voltage.

**As EU packets travel along a cable they will lose energy** and eventually disapear. The rate of loss is different for each type of cable. The following list assumes max insulation:

Packets on tin cables lose 1 eu every 40th block, glass fiber losses 1 per 40, and high voltage loses 1 ever 1.25 blocks.

IC2 machines also have a max voltage they can accept. For most machines this is low voltage. A transformer upgrade will increase the tier of voltage a machine can accept by one per upgrade. If a packet larger than a machine's max voltage gets to the machine

**Multiple packets may travel down a cable or into a machine per game tick. This is the total current or EU/t. Increasing the current will not melt a wire or explode a machine

IC2 Generators output different sized packets. Water mills vary between .25 and 2. Solar panels make 1 eu/t when its not night. Windmills can make up to 11.5

IC2 Transformers, will be out put in 4 low voltage (32eu/p) packets at the same current of 128 eu/t. Alternatively if you have 128 solar panels making 1 eu/p into a line hitting the 3 dot side, you'd still get 128 eu/t but it is now in 4 packets of 32 eu/p instead.

Adding a restone signal to a transformer will cause it to upconvert the power it recieves from the 1 dot sides and output a single higher voltage packet to the 3 dot side.",self,t5_2v620,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/1ad5d0/a_primer_to_ic2_power/

1362291379.0,19kd6h,400+ MJ/tick Cactus Biofuel Factory built within 1 chunk (16x16 block area),Berserkenstein,73,5,25,"So I decided to make a new world when the last direwolf20 patch came out and wanted to see how much self-sustainable power you could get out of a one chunk area.  

I'm a fan of biofuel and the railcraft boilers and engines
I was thinking about would make a nice compact biomass source to use. 

I remembered this vanilla [cactus farm vid](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSEfu7nge5Q) I saw made by Xisumavoid about a year ago.

At the time I didn't think it was very useful since there isn't much use for cactus in vanilla besides dye and hurting things/destroying items

I used a quarry to make an 11x11 hole to bedrock and used a filler to build a tower to the build cap (ly = 255) and built the cactus farm inside.  I set aside some of the bottom area to build a processing area and used the remaining area to build boilers

At first I built one fermenter and 4 stills

I started out with one 36 HP boiler running 18 industrial steam engines (144 mj/tick).  I eventually added 3 more boilers and 54 more industrial steam engines for a total of 576 mj/tick.  

The system ran three 36 HP boilers just fine with surplus biofuel coming in.  I thought it could handle four boilers

The goal was to make a self-sustaining system in one chunk

I also added a small wheat farm so I could use the seeds to make dirt and combine it with the wheat to make compost to fuel the fermenters with IC2 windmills to supply the power for a macerator and compressor.    I changed the wheat processing to make plantballs instead of compost in the video to burn all the apatite I had found. 

TL;DR

A vanilla automatic cactus farm tower can be used to produce enough biofuel to provide over 400 mj/tick with three 36 HP railcraft boilers/engines

1. Load up the save you want the age to be in. Make a new descriptive book. Take note of the age number. Now, along with your new descriptive book.

2. Now

3. Go into your save folder. There won't be a folder for the new age you made

4. Now we are getting into the serious editing. Download a program called [NBTExplorer](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/840677-nbtexplorer-nbt-editor-for-windows-and-mac/). We will use this for changing the age's settings so it matches the world you want to import. Open the level.dat from the world you want to import with NBTExplorer. Copy the seed number and the spawn coordinates. Ignore the player data

5. Go into the game save that you want to import the world into. In the ""data"" folder

6. First

7. There aren't spawn tags yet

That should be it, and visit the age. You will spawn in at the actual spawn of the world. The terrain will be the same and anything you've made in the past will be there. From here on out, this world will act just like a Mystcraft age.

**Important stuff here

Good day to all of you.

I have noticed that alot of people are still unfamiliar with how bee breeding works

If you want me to add something

My knowledge might be limited slightly

***

So

Well, although you can collect the bees you find in the wild.

Yup

The first machine you will need is a carpenter.

http://feed-the-beast.wikia.com/wiki/Carpenter

This machine will allow you to create several nifty items and machines that you will need for beekeeping.

You will also need a squeezer.

http://feed-the-beast.wikia.com/wiki/Squeezer

This machine will allow you to squeeze that lovely seed oil (which means you'll also need a decent wheat farm) for the apiaries you'll be making!

http://feed-the-beast.wikia.com/wiki/Apiary

*^Also

*^http://feed-the-beast.wikia.com/wiki/Beealyzer*

Here it finally is

The way the Apiary works is you place a princess bee in the top slot, the drone disappears, and you get a [x] Queen.

While the bee is in it's Queen stage, it won't give it's children the same genetics.

Oh boy

So, for example, a Meadows purebred princess in the Apiary with a purebred Forest drone, you have a random chance of mutation. Now, not every combination will give you a random chance on a certain species, you have to find the right combinations. Meadows and Forest combination gives a chance to get Common bees.

But what happens when you get bees with active and inactive species that are different? Well

Let's take a princess with a Meadows active gene, and Forest inactive.

What are our chances to get a common purebred here?

Well, as they only have 1 gene on each bee.

Now I'm not going to tell you how to get every bee in the game. There's plenty of sites

Beekeeping is part luck

Also, so just slap it in a computer and you're good to go. :)

BuildCraft has always been a mod that's about doing simple things

Most mods nowadays take a different approach. They make things whose power is proportional to the resources it takes to build them and run them. They just make *things*. Not mechanics. Not things that require the user to think.

A good example is GregTech. GregTech adds a lot of devices that are expensive, liquids, and items to the right spots at the right time. You have to do the math to figure out how much of what goes where, but even that is made very easy with AE because of its ability to route so precisely and easily.

I was excited to see steam showing up in RailCraft when they first started doing that. I was hoping for some new kinetic types of mechanics. Moving parts with pressurized steam and having those parts do things or make other things do things. Stuff like that. But it's basically just been turned into a liquid power source.

RedPower 2 brought us a new mechanic that we call frames. And people *loved* that. ComputerCraft brought a new one in the way of adding logic to a world without big redstone contraptions. Tinkers Construct added the mechanic of modular tools and liquidizing metals.

I haven't seen very many new mechanics come out of the modding community in recent times. Just machines that do stuff for you if you pipe in the right resources into its inventories. To me,False,self,t5_2v620,False,,,t3_1iqkxt

1366701028.0,1cx87d,Bee Lifespan Mechanics,shanrockstarfish,73,16,19,"After a couple of days fiddling around with alvearies and how different traits affect the lifespan and productivity of bees

From what I've gathered, a ""bee tick"" is a lot different from a regular game tick. A ""bee tick"" happens every 550 regular ticks, or every 27.5 seconds. Which is why it takes a while between anything happening when it comes to apiculture.

Bee ticks determine three things; 1) How long a queen produces for before dying

For the lifespan gene, short, shortened, normal, elongated, long, longer and longest. Each allele confers a ""durability"" to the queen

So if a queen starts with the Long lifespan trait (which gives it 50 bee ticks of durability), until it reaches zero, at which point it dies and you get the offspring. The same thing happens with frames, except they vanish once their durability hits zero.

Here's a list of what I've calculated the durabilities to be (measured in bee ticks).

Lifespan genes:

Shortest; 10.

Shorter; 20.

Short; 30.

Shortened; 35.

Normal; 40.

Elongated; 45.

Long; 50.

Longer; 60.

Longest; 70.

As for the durability of frames:

Untreated

Metabolic; 24.

Gentle; 40.

Magic, Healing, Restraint, Nova; 48.

Necrotic; 54.

Temporal; 60.

Proven; 144.

Resilient; 168.

To calculate how many seconds this is, and a bee with the ""Lifespan: Long"" gene will last for 1375 seconds (22 minutes, 55 seconds).

If lifespan-affecting frames (like Soul Frames or Gentle Frames) need to be considered to calculate the lifespan of your bees

Say you've got a bee with the ""Longest"" lifespan trait (e.g., instead of the usual 70 bee ticks of life you'd get, you instead get

70 * (1 - 50%) * (1 - 50%) * (1 + 50%) = 70 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 1.5 = 26.25

which rounds up to 27 bee ticks. So your Relic bee will die quicker than a non-frame-affected bee with the Short lifespan trait (30 bee ticks).

Hope this information is consistent with whatever you might find, I hope it helps with all you bee-breeders out there. I'm currently working to decipher the productivity mechanic, which I think will be a lot more useful.

EDIT: Just finished working out the productivity multiplier

You get a 1.2x multiplier for using an alveary, I've found that;

Slowest productivity bees need 10 frames.

Slower

Fast

So there you go! You now know how to maximise the productivity of all your bees,False,self,t5_2v620,1366771803.0,,,t3_1cx87d

First of all, and now officially surpasses the rendering capability of old RP2 because nothing is ever drawn as a placeholder anymore, and every mod is supported natively without having to be added to a list. (No, that's not a shot at RP2: It's just a comparison.)

I discovered an item-loss problem with continuous carriages and Buildcraft pipes: When Buildcraft pipes are reloaded (either from a save file, they have a deliberate builtin delay of 2 ticks before they process their items-in-transit. If the carriage moves again immediately without those ticks passing, the items irrevocably disappear. So, I added a mandatory 5-tick (1/4 of a second at normal speed) cooldown on all continuous motion. (This also has the added benefit of giving a small window of being able to interact with the engine each time it moves, so if you have trapped yourself, you can turn it back out of continuous mode with a screwdriver.)

More compatibility with mods too: Keep reporting bugs if you find them!

Also, /u/JustHev, and /u/uberifix. Visit the Technic thread to see screenshots; Edit the config file to select the one you want. Two of the five texture options have increased contrast and use patterns instead of just colours to support colourblind users (though since I'm not colourblind myself, I need people who are to check them to make sure they're suitable for the purpose).",,False,self,False,t3_1htbil

Here's the thing- the way I see it, is all one big playground where the only rules that matter are the ones you enforce on yourself. Things like NEI or even creative mode mean that ultimately we as players have control over our worlds and ourselves. But I've yet to see a complaint about either being overpowered, let alone with the furor I've seen hurled at other mods. I don't get it. Aren't they the same, in principle? I could get a stack of Nether Stars in a single click, with NEI. The only difference is that I choose not to. That choice is the point of Minecraft, isn't it? If I want to do something, I do it, let's say in Vanilla I don't think I've 'earned' a bow until I've collected a stack of arrows without one). Point is, *don't use Dartcraft armor.*

Humans will do the more technical mods: IC2

Dwarves will have more dwarf friendly mods like TC and I'm thinking Dartcraft with limitations for balance.

Finally Elves will have Thaumcraft and the more magical mods.

I'm not sure at all how to set the remainder of the mods so there will be a fair balance between the factions.

I intend to have the three factions in their own separate worlds (Elves: Twilight forest; Humans: Special world gen for a more city scape feel; Dwarves: Mystcraft generated dwarven-style age).

I was able to manage it in under 4 hours with almost no infrastructure (just 1 Force Engine, allows you to mine non-valuable blocks by hand faster than just about any pick you can make, makes you essentially immune to fall damage (I fell over 50 blocks and took less than half a heart of damage), and lets you kill any mob in one hit (maybe 2 for some, like Angry Endermen).  It seems to have diamond-level damage reduction despite being made out of *leather*, and that's without having the Sturdy modifier on any pieces (which provides 25% damage reduction each, up to 75%).

The tools you get from this aren't much more reasonable.  A pickaxe with Speed V can mine a 3x3 area in a second or two at most in area mode.  You can put Fortune IV on a pickaxe and expect to get ~2-3x yield on average - I was frequently getting 15+ lapis from each block, or Grinding + Smelting to make ore processing itself obsolete.

Edit: a huge issue is how cheap the upgrades are.  That armor required only 4 claws (from bats), and 4 fortunes (cookie + paper).

Personally, mod updates can be crowd-sourced, and there will be fewer barriers to making disparate mods compatible and able to inter-operate. Finally, unpopular DRM could not survive, as making a fork without DRM would be trivial.

So who would be willing to play using this mod pack to put pressure on modders? And which are the most popular mods that wouldn't make the cut?

First there's a heat oven

Then there's the Cyclone Converter Furnace (based on [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIsarna_steelmaking_process)). This originated as a way to produce steel

On top of producing molten metals

Then of course there has to be a machine to cool the molten metal down to ingots. The industrial water cooler does this. As you put molten metal, you can heat this block with standard heat sources instead of molten metal (the metal is just heating it, after all), and as the water cools the block, the water is heated and turned into steam. This steam can be used just like railcraft steam is used.

Next is the alloy mixer. Pump in two or more molten metals and if they fit a recipe

But here I'm at a loss. I'm not sure what else to add. I can't think of anything to do with the new metals I'm creating and I can't think of anything else to do with the heat I'm generating. Anyone have any ideas?

Also, I'm likely to add it. So use any alloy in your ideas.

&gt; Added new Power pipes

&gt; All pipes have much smaller max throughput:

&gt; * Cobble = 8 MJ/t
&gt; * Stone = 16 MJ/t
&gt; * Wood = 32 MJ/t
&gt; * Quartz = 64 MJ/t
&gt; * Gold = 256 MJ/t
&gt; * Diamond = 1024 MJ/t

&gt; The power display will turn red if a pipe has hit its max capacity. You can use smaller pipes to throttle certain parts of your power net.

&gt; Machines are more lossy now to make up for the lossless pipes. Expect low power draws even when idle.
