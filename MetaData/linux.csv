Within hours the wireless chipset failed and refused to connect

The RMA was declined for a ""modified/altered operating system.""  I spoke with a support agent

I've used Newegg for years and spent tens of thousands on tech gear with them

EDIT 1 - I'll get a copy of the RMA reply I had today

EDIT 2 - RMA decline response -&gt; http://imgur.com/7bcIJ  
The restore partition was left intact

EDIT 3 - Yes

EDIT 4 - I submitted this to Consumerist earlier today and am waiting to hear back from them.

EDIT 5 - I'm going to sleep now and will check this in the morning.  Not sure of whether I will hear back from them on the weekend

6/9/2012

EDIT 6 - WOW! I just woke up and was not expecting the level of response I've gotten from this post.  Still nothing from Newegg

EDIT 7 - I still haven't heard anything from them at 12:04pm EST

6/10/2012

EDIT 8 - This edit will remain with a periodically updated time until I hear back from them.  NO RESPONSE AS OF - 11:42PM EST Jun 10

6/11/2012

EDIT 9 - I'm receiving some scripted looking emails from info@newegg.com this afternoon:

""This notification has been sent because we provided you an earlier email in error. You were sent an email indicating that we had posted your item(s) as part of the ""Return."" Unfortunately

Don't know what to make of that considering I was escalated and spoke with a manager who had my account pulled up and the exact response from the tech about the ""modified OS.""

I also got a blank $0.00 order confirmation from them and a UPS 3 Day Select shipping confirmation.  Don't know if that's the old one coming back or if they're sending a new one.    The order number comes up blank if I check the status on Newegg.com.

Stay tuned.

6/12/2012

EDIT 10 (hopefully final) -

 I'm sure many of you saw this story on Consumerist and the front page of Slashdot today.  I spoke with a ""Public Image Professional"" from Newegg who contacted me via email.  She immediately offered to replace the laptop or process a full refund

**Yes**

-------------------------------------

This is a kind of crosspost summary of a new copyright amendment bill that was announced yesterday. [Bill C-32](http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?DocId=4580265&amp;Mode=1&amp;Language=F&amp;File=72#16) attempts to 'modernize' copyright law in Canada to bring it up to spec with other developed nations (aka to meet US agenda).

The bill would make it illegal to circumvent or break locks of any kind on digital media

*   Own and play region-locked DVDs from other countries
*   Play regular DVDs on Linux
*   Play Blu-Ray *Discs* on Linux
*   Transfer media to an iPod Touch / iPhone / iPad using Linux
*   Strip DRM from music on Linux in order to listen to it

And anything else that involves restricted content that lacks official Linux support.

Speak up while you can. [Find your MP](http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Parlinfo/Compilations/HouseOfCommons/MemberByPostalCode.aspx?Menu=HOC&amp;Language=E) and write them an email telling them why you are opposed to [C-32](http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?DocId=4580265&amp;Mode=1&amp;Language=F&amp;File=72#16). 

We don't want a US style DMCA

**Edit:** Here is a template based on the email I wrote to *my* MP. Feel free to use it

**Also:** If you are willing

-----------------------------------

Dear **&lt;Your MP&gt;**

I am writing to you again to express a major point of concern I have found with the newly tabled Bill C-32. While this bill appears to make many positive changes


In Article 41 it becomes clear to me that any media with Digital Rights Management (DRM) protection applied supersedes all other changes introduced by the bill. For example


This bill does not help the consumer


Bill C-32 has potential


Thank you for your time

2. The company started a Kickstarter where they managed to raise $2.5 million in funding for the device but it seems that any discussions pertaining to open source licensing were nowhere to be found. Link: [A blog article discussing this issue](http://robmyers.org/2013/04/26/oculus-rift-free-software/)
3. Palmer posted a response on Reddit where he made it clear that the company now intends to maintain exclusive rights to the software and has no plans to license its SDK under LGPL or any other sort of open source license because of their research and development costs. Link: [Palmer's reply on /r/oculus subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1dfnhw/id_like_to_hear_palmer_respond_to_this_oculus_not/c9pvvwg)

Is he right in saying that it would be impossible to compete if they moved towards more open licensing and that doing so would be unfair because of the R&amp;D that they have devoted to the project? As someone that has been closely been following the Oculus for months I found this quite disappointing since a product this amazing is ripe for innovation and does not deserve to be locked down to anyone who wishes to improve upon it. 

Are there any good examples of hardware/software companies that have been successful even though their products use open licenses?

*****

Edit1: Grammar. 

Edit2: Screenshots.

Edit3:

1. It seems that the issue mostly rests with the disagreements about what constitutes, the source can be viewed, but there are restrictions on how the SDK may be modified and distributed.

2. The original second bullet also made mention that the Kickstarter was void of any promises of openness and it turns out that this was because the dynamics of the project had shifted heavily once larger key players [think large studios] showed their interest/support. There were concerns about big companies opting away from implementing and supporting the Oculus if it caused them to have to legally release more of their code than they might be comfortable with

3. Suggestions have been brought up about just releasing the hardware driver alone with a more relaxed license or even a splitting into multiple versions of the SDK. The issue really boils down into a  double-edged sword in which, additions, and innovations to the project, but on the other hand, in doing so it would push away big players that would otherwise embrace the device which would of course could potentially be detrimental to the quick adoption of games into the virtual reality movement. As with most things, it seems that time will tell just how permissive the final version of the Oculus Rift's license will be.

I re-appropriated the 3 year+ old hardware to our office where I host all the systems I discuss. I coveted some of the servers to SAN/NAS using FreeNAS it works well for that. 

I will have been with the company 2 years in July. When I came the prior IT Director hacked some systems together, KVM, VirtualBox, and Qemu all hosting office services. There were countless services running on each server in a live environment. I had no password or even a list of what was out there. I pushed the owner to buy more hardware for our SAS cluster and move the old equipment to the office where I began rebuilding. The office and CoLo's were using some 5+ year old Juniper SSG's, I replaced them with pFsense and locked down all ports but email. Everyone was pissed, but I had to lock out the old IT admin ASAP.  They were running OpenVPN on a server sharing dozens of other services, I moved this to pFsense which had a new IP and ports, so I could control password via LDAP. VPN was down for 3 weeks

I see a lot of posts ageist ""Mercurial""

Why I choose the things I did. You have to understand that I'm giving support to the general populous of my company, and I already have a web interface that does most of what Thunderbird does. I chose a 32bit disto because I have old equipment and did not want to have to track bugs in more than one system. 

Why I choose Mint 13 and then bastardized it? It all started with the Intel DN2800MT. We build a gateway device and we are currently using the Intel DN2800MT with mSATA at the heart of it. The board is rock solid, only because of styling. Our lead electrical engineer love openSUSE. The real question is do you like Yum. Yast, or Aptitude. I've use them all and they all have their advantages. When Mint won the battle was because Mint 13 32bit Mate was the only distro that worked with graphics on this board at install. Hence Mint became the choice when there was to be any misc projects at the office. Could we of probably of made other distro's work, well with enough time and money you can do anything. Two things we have little of by the way. I took the easy way out, our Lead Engineer tried to get openSUSE to work with out luck, and our lead programmer tried Debian, failing also. I was the first with a HTPC, but they are both smart guys who know Linux well. I swapped the owner over to Mint, time clocks
I also run Fully Automated Nagous, I did not really care for it, but use what you like.

Security; 
I used pFsense to block most traffic, and anything sports related there was almost a mutiny. Ironically sales were up 12%! Managers were at each others throats, sales fighting the hardest, saying they needed a ""Staycation"" at there desks between calls. Another irony was daily sales calls were up much more that 20%. I guess when your board at work you call people, even clients? We backed off eventually and sales decreased..... 
At the workstations; I do not allow users access to root, installed AdBlock Plus. I  enabled IDS in pFsense. I purchased TrenMicro security for endpoints which monitors my Vmware and Linux servers, I also run scripted scans from my Linux workstation of bitdefender, and avast, just to feel worm and fuzzy. 

Training;
I do weekly training for anyone in the company who wants to attend every 3:30 to 5:00 pm on Mondays. I used Kazam to capture the screen as video and edited it via Blender. I have videos geared directly to our office setup! The videos are available linked via the wiki to our samba share. Blender was the most popular with around 15 people attending. 


How long did it take?
Three weeks to convert the office to Linux Mint 13

And not to mention

So

* Create a new website, slides and so, but keeping usability.
* The website will be ""Wiki-Like"" meaning you can edit Distro's pages
* An accurate Ranking
* And of course

What do you think ? We need opinions, servers... just an idea for now, but we can make this happen.

**EDIT: Thanks for the 200+ responses

**It seems that half of the problem is with me not knowing the difference between UEFI and BIOS and trying to boot into a non-UEFI distro. The other half is with the company not mentioning anything about UEFI or Windows 8!**

**I'm going to attempt to make a UEFI USB stick with Arch on before attempting to return it.**

**tl;dr** Spent ages looking forward to laptop; Windows 8 is the only option.

Sorry for the wall of text.

When my old laptop died my time educating myself about Linux

Quad core i7

Oh well it is really good looking

Hmm... No BIOS access even once I had googled the manual, apparently you need to hold Shift when you shut down Windows 8 to get it to actually shut down. Da fuq.

Anyways boots up and into BIOS wooo! okay lets put my CrunchBang CD in and set the boot order. Hm. No option to boot from CD/DVD. That is rather odd. No matter I have it on my USB stick!

This time I get an option to boot from the stick! Okay lets select that.... Reboots into Windows 8! Now this is starting to get on my nerves. Back into BIOS

Boots into Windows 8. Fuck a duck this is worst than a rootkit. Okay extreme measures now; lets take out the SSD so it CAN'T boot from Windows 8. Power it on goes straight to BIOS. Well you can select boot override to boot straight into the USB stick from BIOS

Did nothing. I then tried Ubuntu 12.xx

Now it is going to cost me £36 to get my money back and I am still without a laptop to continue my computing enlightenment.

:(

EDIT: Thanks for all the support guys! The few things that have een suggested are:

* Disable secure boot
&gt;I had already found this in the BIOS and disabled it so that didn't help

* Make sure your bootable media is UEFI compatible. 
&gt;I'm not entirely sure if what I have been using is/ I've been making Live USB sticks with this softare: http://www.linuxliveusb.com should that work?

* Put another HDD in
&gt;A friend suggested that I put the HDD from my old laptop in

* Take the SSD out and format/install linux on it from another machine
&gt;Again

* Don't pay the £36 you shouldn't have to

1362249436.0,19j779,[Correction] Watching DVDs on Linux is NOT illegal in the USA,diafygi,776,194,82,"This is in response to the [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/19iq93/why_watching_dvds_on_linux_is_illegal_in_the_usa/) saying it was illegal to watch DVDs in the USA. I thought I would clarify legal DVD use with free software in the United States.

Section [1201](http://static.chillingeffects.org/1201.shtml) of the DMCA specifically outlaws the *distribution* of circumvention tools.

&gt; No person shall manufacture, provide, or otherwise traffic in any technology, product, service, device, component, that is primarily designed or produced for the purpose of circumventing a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under this title 

-DMCA 1201(a)(2)

It does *not* outlaw the *use* of those tools. Fair use of circumvention tools is legal according to the DMCA

&gt; Nothing in this section shall affect rights, or defenses to copyright infringement, including fair use, under this title

-DMCA 1201(c)(1)

So, so you have to find it outside of the US. This is why the [medibuntu](http://medibuntu.org/) repositories are hosted in a country that still allows circumvention program distrobution.

The [RealNetworks v. DVD-CCA](http://www.eff.org/cases/universal-city-studios-v-realnetworks) decision referenced in the previous post actually said this specifically:

&gt; while it may well be fair use for an individual consumer to store a backup copy of a personally owned DVD on that individual's computer

To install

    hwinfo --framebuffer

with root

    vbeinfo 

at grub's command line

Their output may be different though.

Theme is released under CC-SA


**In some occurences (as in testing on really old PCs) GRUB has locked up when a theme is applied

You can find my other work [here.](http://gnome-look.org/usermanager/search.php?username=LegendaryBibo&amp;action=contents) I have more themes here.

If you want to disable it

    locate grub.cfg

So its location should be in /grub

Now

    grub2-mkconfig -o /grub/grub.cfg
   
or

    grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg

or

    grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg

with root depending on grub.cfg's location.

**If you're on Ubuntu you can just run this**

    sudo update-grub

**to do the same thing**

I burned a copy of Ubuntu to a disc and went over to his house. I explained to him that I was going to reformat it and put a new OS on his system. He didn't really follow what I meant

Immediately I was met with lots of objections. Of course. I spent a couple hours getting it set up - I moved all the files he wanted to keep to a new partition

I sat with him for a bit and showed him how to access everything

This was 5 years ago. 

I never received another call for help. He never ran in to problems he couldn't figure out how to fix himself

So about a month ago I built him a new PC. His computer was already archaic when I put Ubuntu on it. I'm pretty sure he got it in 97 or 98. He was finally calling about issues with his PC again and I figured it was on its last legs. It could barely handle anything running on the system. It was in a sad way. So I ordered parts and threw a new one together for him. Oh

As I'm pulling parts out of the box, and he starts pacing around nervously as I begin piecing it together. Once it's successfully POSTed I reach into my toolkit and grab the copy of Ubuntu I had brought to install, and put the Windows disc away, and immediately he says ""oh thank you so much."" I look up and say, ""for?"" He says ""I was afraid you were going to put Windows on the new computer."" I laughed. ""Nope, you like Ubuntu right?""

* Flash player is a major privacy concern. It allows ""flash cookies"" to be installed on your computer, it allows third party apps to track you. Check it out [here](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html)
* Multiple security vulnerabilities: Click http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/ select ""Adobe"" from vendors and ""Flash player"" from title.
* Terrible Linux support! Since my latest ""apt-get upgrade"", I just spent 1 hours trying different ""solutions"", none of which helped in any way. Basically, flash renders video with a software renderer because it can't figure out how to use my video hardware.

Well there *is* a solutions!

Your browser [*probably* supports HTML5 features

Now if you are a website developer, use HTML5. We need to rid the world of this evil plugin that we are forced to install just for watching youtube videos. Oh and if by any chance the person reading this is a Youtube dev, please, enable full support for HTML5 video playback on **all** Youtube videos. Lots of Youtube videos have ads, and as of today I am boycotting Flash and I can't view those videos. Let's fix browser-based video streaming once and for all!",,False,t5_2qh1a,True

I started working at a small computer repair shop a month ago. I now realize that Linux has spoiled me. Software conflicts, toolbars, software that takes too much system resources, and Windows being clunky itself. We also buy and sell used computers. Typically if a computer still has a Windows key sticker on it we will load whatever version of Windows the code is for, but the ones that don't have the sticker, or it's unreadable we use them for parts. The boss said that the next one that we get that doesn't have a sticker I can put Linux on it (we have enough parts computers). I told him that if I do that, he will probably never see them again until there was a piece of hardware that went bad and that might actually be bad for business. He agreed but he was willing to do one as a trial

Splash does some naive resizing using a Bresenham algorithm (sic!) so I found this [3 year old issue](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=22138) on the poppler tracker and proposed that it should be replaced with Lanczos for upscaling. The response in the vein of ""patches welcome"" was not unexpected. I started looking at Lanczos implementations and realized I can't do any better than using an existing library. I picked ImageMagick.

After carefully integrating it in the 2 build systems supported by poppler as an optional dependency (defaulting to ""auto"") I went on to implement bitmap conversion from Splash to ImageMagick and back

Basically I have a brand new netbook I got for Christmas. First thing I wiped the drive and installed Fedora on it. Yesterday, right? Nope.

I've been on the phone with tech support now for over an hour. The guy there has no clue what to do, then run their special little HP battery status test.

I've given them the BIOS error code (I don't even think the guy knows what the BIOS is honestly), and without the HP battery status application they won't send me a new battery.

Right now the only option they're giving me is to PAY to order the Windows 7 Starter media from them to restore my netbook to factory condition

This is absolutely f'ing ridiculous. I'm steaming pissed right now... and I'm still on the phone holding to speak to the supervisor.

Can anyone offer any assistance? A phone number for higher level support? Or someone at HP who works in tech support that actually has a brain and doesn't work in India?

I know /r/linux may not be the best subreddit for this

**EDIT:** Quote from the supervisor:

Him: You have voided your software warranty and need to reinstall Windows 7 to get it back

Me: Ok

Him: I understand

Me: Well I can't do that

Him: Well I am the supervisor here and I know the warranty better than you do.

**EDIT2:** I've now been on the phone for 2 hours and 20 minutes... I finally spoke to some case manager

**EDIT3:** I got the battery this morning. Guess they shipped it overnight air. Netbook is working just fine now. :) I did notice that the 'acpi' command in Fedora doesn't work right with the battery though. It still says the same thing, unlike the other battery. I guess that has something to do with the acpi in Fedora not being fully compatible with the netbook's hardware, who knows.

Compare systemd, AppArmor, and Mir. Do these combinations look anything alike? We are seeing a splintering of the traditional Linux ecosystem into two distinct Fedora and Ubuntu ecosystems.

Both distributions are trying to create a core OS stack that can be used to create compatible distributions. ""Why have different init systems or display servers, they seem to be saying.

So far the Fedora camp has support from more distributions (excluding any downstream distros). Arch, Gentoo, and Slack, each with a different goal altogether, don't seem to be following either at the moment.

We are witnessing history as it unfolds. Good or bad, pick a side soon enough. Instead of Linux we will see Linux-Fedora-Camp and Linux-Ubuntu-Camp, in addition to Linux-xyz-Camps. Many upstream userland projects, such as GUI toolkits and desktop environments, will also favor one side more than the other.

I believe that as things stand right now, will gravitate toward Linux-Ubuntu-Camp. Those of us who fall into both categories, because we are sysadmins *and* mobile users, will participate in Linux-Fedora-Camp as enthusiastic contributors (including hearty flamewars) and will just use Linux-Ubuntu-Camp products with minimal or no participation.

I'm not saying the split is good or bad for not only the ecosystem but for users as well. Only time will make that decision. I'm just trying to create awareness about what I see of how things are as they stand now and the effect they have on our future.

Out of the box, and frequently locking up right after logging in.

I reformatted

At this point, another 1 week for the laptop to ship/return, 2 to get fixed, and 1 to ship back. All in all, that's 2 months.

I then received the laptop without the power adapter; they claimed it wasn't received and wanted me to buy another one... for $70. I managed to get them to send me another for free when I threatened to return the whole machine. So add another week for the adapter to ship.

Sadly, and the exact same problems occurred immediately.

So the company's philosophy on a lemon is to do the laziest 'fix' possible

At this point, they decided to take off another $125 for scratches, of course... and there's no way it got scratched on my end, considering it was never used for more than a few hours and sat in a laptop case the rest of the time.

Just something to think about.

Thomas A. Knight has put up a page that tells Ken's story and he's volunteered to host the fund raising page for this effort. Please help us by a small donation and spreading the word. Ken's done magnificent work for the past 7 years in getting Linux computers into the hands of poor children. I'm just hoping that the community at large sees enough value in Ken to help him beat this monster. Because

For those who don't know: There are MiniDisc devices which use a proprietary USB protocol (NetMD) or on-disk format (Hi-MD) to transfer and store audio data. Naturally, we finally managed to get the MiniDisc hardware to work on Linux.

We support reading and writing to NetMD devices, we will soon be able to fully support all MiniDisc devices with our software making the use of the proprietary software from MiniDisc vendors unnecessary.

1359194512.0,17b64a,PSA: Avoid WD Passport drives.  You can't reformat them for use as just a normal drive with Linux.,shoeman22,633,248,186,"After tearing my hair out all evening trying to reformat this stupid drive, and Testdisk all failed to do anything and I can't even use mkfs.ext4 on the drive directly because it would appear the firmware ""protects"" the disk from being reformatted.

It's beyond infuriating.  WD calls this technology ""Smart Ware"".  Oh the irony.

Here's some more reading for those who are interested: 

http://community.wdc.com/t5/WD-Portable-Drives/Remove-the-VCD-from-my-drive/td-p/7066


**EDIT: Found a way to fix my drive

1. Plug the drive into a Windows box. (Windows 7 64-bit was what I used).

2. Download

3. Reboot.

4. Download
You might also need to install .Net from [here](http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=17718).  I'm not even sure if this step is 100% necessary

5. Reboot again.

6. Now search for ""format"" in the windows run box and you should find something like ""create and format drives"".  Select that.

7. Now you should see your drive and it'll show as 2 partitions.  For my 2tb

8. Delete both those partitions. (right click on them and delete)

9. It should now say it's totally unallocated

I'm now able to read and write to it from my linux box so that was good enough for me

Still

**TL;DR; Save yourself the headache and avoid the WD Passport (WDBY8L0020BBK-01) get the [Seagate](http://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Backup-Portable-External-STBU1000100/dp/B00829THO6/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1359262752&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=seagate+external+hard+drive) instead.

1282329922.0,d3jss,Six months ago I wrote about how I turned my whole office to Linux... here's an update...,jasonhaley,562,207,241,"A few people have asked me how it went

**Are you still running Linux or do you regret it?**
Yes I'm still with Linux. Overall

**What kind of business is this?**
We're a local news company. My staff consists of editors, photographers, production managers (for layout), business managers and a few other positions.

*Please note that the designers and business managers weren't put on Linux. The designers are trained to use photoshop

**Was it a bumpy road?**
Somewhat, but I receive questions maybe once a week and find myself annoyed at how sometimes the most simple of tasks take a few minutes out of the work day for some people when I'm not around. On the other hand, I guess that time could be considered part of the ""training"" (I provided very little training, as we only were using word-processors, firefox, and gimp.) Regardless, an IT person could probably be handy.

**Did you decide to upgrade the computers to 10.04 or kept 9.10?**
I kept it at 9.10. 10.04 only offered me enough incentive to switch on my own personal computer

**Did lots of your workers ask Windows back?**
Only one Mac user requested Windows back. Actually
 
**How's compatibility with Microssoft Office?**
Not bad, but it wasn't a big enough deal... iirc formatting issues happened between different versions of MS Word as well.

**Has anyone been ""converted"" into using Linux**
Yes

**Biggest problems with Linux??**
In my last post I said that I let the designers/production managers keep their Macs as I knew that they required photoshop more than the average worker may need MS Office. They were the only people in my office, I'd probably have to re-hire new designers.

I think the biggest problem was the little problems that came up periodically. Like ""Oh how do I stop Office from autoformatting"" (backspace) and those types of questions. As I mentioned, we're a small business and I can do it myself and save money that way. Again, let me stress that I don't think I know anywhere near as much as professional IT people, I just know enough to get a network of computers working with each other.

**Do you see any problems happening in the future?**
A problem I can foresee happening that I've luckily avoided is driver compatibility. One of my home PCs ubuntu can't recognize the broadcomm wireless driver.. I've tried everything with ndiswrapper

**Any programs which have streamlined production flow?**
Hmm.. as in ones people don't usually mention? I liked a few opensource alternatives to googlewave

I also really like [Voxforge](http://www.voxforge) which is an open source speech-recognition software. To have a program which can convert audio files to text would be amazing for journalists, then speech recognition on Linux would be incredible.

**Any bad crashes?**
There was one due to a poor hard disk failure

**How well do you know Linux or Ubuntu?**
No more than I knew how to use Windows. I think someone should only try this if they've used Ubuntu (or any distro) for a year or so and maybe on different computers. Or at the very least have learnt how to troubleshoot problems by themselves using Google/Ubuntu forums

*Bad Memory HowTo*

So.. Memtest tells you have bad ram! write down the memory addresses that return errors in memtest. then let's fix them.

 Here are your easy options:

1- Buy new ram

2- Turn off everything after the bad memory

3- Turn off just the memory around the bad memory

&gt;i chose solution 3

You have to edit the /etc/default/grub file Of course... you have to have admin rights

Now... you will se something like this:

    # If you change this file
    # /boot/grub/grub.cfg.

    GRUB_DEFAULT=0
    GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0
    GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=false
    GRUB_TIMEOUT=""10""
    GRUB_DISTRIBUTOR=`lsb_release -i -s 2&gt; /dev/null || echo Debian`
    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=""quiet splash memmap=5M\\\$970M""
    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=""""



save the file and run

sudo update-grub

this will ignore the 5MB of RAM above 970M (memmap=5M\\\\\$970M)

&gt;mfw it worked

1293693166.0,etiv2,I'm just tired of being forced to buy the OS with my preferred HW. My letter to Lenovo support:,syngen,507,187,278,"I just tried to buy a Lenovo laptop without windows installed on it or a refund - it was a no go. So here is my letter to them 


Dear Lenovo support

Our company is looking into buying a new laptop till the end of the year. I would like to buy a Lenovo T510 however the requirement to purchase an apparently inseparable windows license together with the model is holding me back to take advantage of some of the very attractive sales offers at the moment.


I have been a IBM/Lenovo user since the beginning of my professional life, where all employees were supplied with Thinkpads. Since then, convinced by the quality and durability of IBM/Lenovo products I have been personally buying Thinkpads continuously for the past 10 years and I have owned the models 3?0, A21, X41, T43p, T400. I am promoting Lenovo products to colleagues and friends in case they do require to run a Windows operating system anyways. Just recently I purchased for my current company a Lenovo Thinkserver TD230 with dual Xeon Processors for our in house development which I was able to purchase without an operating System preinstalled. Because of this it seems unlikely to me that the bundling of a windows license to a computer is a technical necessity and my choice of 'no' operating system if remembering correctly made a difference of between ca 100 CAD and almost half of the total value of a basic TD230 server


Our company, open and free standards as well as compatibility between existing standards in the past and present. These compatibility problems have also proven to add additional costs for our customers due to the additional testing required to ensure compatibility with some Microsoft products (ref: OOXML + poor web standard support of previous IE versions, http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20101219121621828). 


With the purchase of a Thinkpad laptop the included windows license and it's associated cost cannot be put to use in our company and cannot be sold on either. It compares to me to the equally frustrating experience where a customer orders a tailor made suit and is forced to buy along with it a misfit shirt with your name printed on it.

Additionally, this seems to confirm my above mentioned concerns about the business practices employed, by disallowing customer choice in a presumably easily providable area. Ironically it also seems that the beneficiary company through their employed practices raises the price of products for our clients, and my purchase on top of this would be wrongly registered as 'another happy windows user' in the Microsoft sales statistics. 


While shopping for my previous Thinkpad I discussed my wish to not purchase the Windows operating system with one of your sales representatives and we were able (after some discussion) to agree on a 'Return Prevention Refund' of CAD 100 as a refund for the not to be used Windows Vista Version already installed on the machine. Today unfortunately I was not able to reach such an agreement. While there are documented cases where customers are able to return their windows licenses after they purchased their product (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_refund#Lenovo) at this moment I am not willing to go through this time consuming and often frustrating process of returning something I do not want to purchase from you in the first place.


With this letter I'm hoping that you can provide me with a solution where I can buy a Thinkpad product and:

1) register with Lenovo as a client who does not want to purchase a windows license bundled with the computer (of whom I don't appear to be the only one judging from comments during my earlier conversation with your sales representative) 

2) receive a discount in exchange for the windows license applied to the sales contract without the need to go through a lengthy after sales return process.

While my familiarity with the Thinkpad line would make a depart difficult for me I have nonetheless started requesting information on alternative laptop brands without the requirement to purchase a windows license together with the base model. 

I would be grateful for a reply and even more for a suitable offer.

With kind regards

## The dock

The _last_ place I want a UI element that interacts by just mouse position is on the left hand of my screen.  Every time I try to interact with anything that happens to be on the left-hand part of the screen, making me move the cursor away from the edge of the screen, wait half a second, and then slowly and carefully move my cursor to where I originally wanted, making double-sure that I don't accidentally touch the edge of the screen, because if I do, that costs me about a second extra of interacting with the desktop environment.

Now, but [Mark Shuttleworth](https://bugs.launchpad.net/unity/+bug/668415/comments/2) has declared that it won't, because it doesn't meet with their ""broader design goals"".

Also, but short of hacking around in CCSM, I can't find any option for making the dock visibility always-on.

Add to it that the dock placement being uncustomizable by design completely falls apart once you connect multiple screens to your computer, over, or to the right of the primary display.  And, placing the primary display over my secondary one just doesn't work - this is a laptop.  I can't rip the screen off from the rest of the machine, and place it above my monitor.  

I can't imagine that this would only affect me either. I can't be the only software developer in existence that uses Ubuntu

## Lenses

So, a good idea, because they provide a relatively touch-friendly means of interacting with the environment, in the case that a user has a touch device.  The problem is that this is a desktop OS, and the amount of touch-enabled devices Ubuntu is installed on is miniscule, compared to normal desktops and laptops, so it's really optimized for the wrong use case.

Also, you're not going to have a cursor.

But, but for extra amusement, I'm going to suggest the ""Run application"" lens.  Now, type something into it.  When you're done typing, you would expect that pressing ""Tab"" would move you to the ""Results"" part of the lens?  Guess what, it doesn't.  It takes you to the ""Search Files &amp; Folders"" lens - and you now have no way of getting back to the ""Run application"" lens.  

This behaves like exactly _no_ user interface I've used since I first started using a WIMP UI in 1985 or so.  It's inconsistent with how form and application dialogs behave on exactly every other remotely popular operating system or desktop environment

## Synaptic and Software Center

I _do_ understand that most users want something simpler than synaptic.  

What I don't understand is why synaptic has to be put on the unsupported list, it's often simpler than using apt(itude).

The new software center doesn't accomodate any of that - it looks like a cheap storefront, but it's too dumbed down for any remotely advanced user.

## Music

I realize that Canonical are trying to get some revenue from their users and all, whenever I listen to music, I'm not going to use Banshee. Ever. I'd rather be trapped with that steaming pile of shit called iTunes.  Making my media keys suddenly not work in Quod Libet in 11.10. Smooth. I'm still not going to use Banshee.

1371302348.0,1gechf,CrunchBang - I got my mind blown,blu132,431,132,168,"Hello there
I'll just tell you a story in my not really that mildly impressive English skills. If you can't stand these anymore

My first Linux distribution was and still is Ubuntu 12.04. Before that, my relationship with Linux started to grow. I only used XP that I still had on another hard drive if something just didn't want to work. When the old harddrive finally died, it wasn't a big deal for me. I fully jumped over to Linux and I noted that it was gone from GRUB and I couldn't access it anymore but I didn't really miss it. I liked Ubuntu. Everything of it. Even Unity (what seems to be hated a lot). But recently a lot of the choices Canonical has made regarding Ubuntu kind of creep me out. So I went to Distrowatch and /r/DistroHopping to see, where I could go.
After a little bit of looking around I thought, I was a bit curious about that ""crunchbang"" I had seen in the search panel of Distrowatch (It really stood out between the other names). I downloaded an image and testet it out in virtual box. ""Looks alright, let's test it on actual hardware"", I thought and copied on a USB drive. And this is the point, where I got my mind blown:

It was nimble
And it worked ""out of the box"" just like Ubuntu did and what XP didn't.
Compared to Openbox and tint2

TL/DR: Crunchbang beats Ubuntu for me.
