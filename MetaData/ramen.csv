1371114014.0,1g9ak6,I studied Yatai (ramen food stands) in Japan for a year! AMA,yataiguy,96,14,117,"Hello everyone! I am using a throwaway account

My name is David, and I have lots of stories to tell. It was a real treat to receive grant money to study something so few people knew about (probably don't care about either!). I did my research between 2010-2011, so my knowledge is a little dated. I am giving my information because I think it would be pretty easy to find an American who studied ramen in Fukuoka.

My profile on the U.S. Consulate Website:
http://fukuoka.usconsulate.gov/f-20110824-01.html

Yatai are very famous in Fukuoka

The unsavory aspects of Yatai

Fukuoka is most famous for tonkotsu ramen. Please check out ramen restaurants like Ichi-ran or Ippudo if you live in Tokyo for a taste! New York City now has an Ippudo! The pork-bone based soup (with extra al dente noodles) is to die for.

**edit 1** Proof: http://i.imgur.com/1x31rFJ.jpg?1

**edit 2** I live in Japan and work tomorrow

**edit 3** A few pictures: Parking lot of Yatai

**edit 4** This has been so amazing. I really found the right subreddit to do this AMA. Thanks so much for all your questions. If you have any lingering questions, but I've been researching Japanese energy security for the last year, if anyone is interested in that, please let me know! Awesome enough, my yatai experience has created amazing opportunities in my life. Thanks guys.

**Why?**

- For fun
- To get an awesome flair (a ramen bowl icon)

**Rules:**

- No Restaurant pics

- Any type of noodle (instant

- Crazy concoctions OK (Sheppards pie, muffins etc) 

- Put * RamenOff * At the start of your post

- 1 day? 2 days? 3 days?

**Questions**

- ~~How long do you think it should last?~~ One week should be enough time for the first one. So from now until Sunday the 27th at midnight. Voting can be for 4 days
- ~~Should there be some sort of proof in each picture (i.e. username or r/ramen written down)?~~ Some sort of proof verifying both username
- ~~What do you think we should do?~~ More suggestions are welcome!

If everyone likes this sort of thing we could do it monthly. 

Special thanks to BIGBADVIRUS and arydactl for starting this!

EDIT

Thanks for the input and suggestions! 

- Some kind of Iron man ingredient challenge would be great
- Upvotes do not seem like the best way to determine the winner


So the deadline to enter is one week from now

I have an idea for a ramen subscription box.

I currently run a wholesale export business here in Japan, postal discounts etc). I have been thinking about doing the same thing, for Ramen.

Does /r/ramen think this could be something viable? I know ramen is seen as a budget food sometimes

What I want to do is send out 5 premium ramen packs per month (large packs of regional/seasonal flavors). With shipping and inventory

Anyway

Thanks!",self,t5_2qykd,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/ramen/comments/1ivcos/ramen_subscription_box_thoughts/

1376503222.0,1kd1xn,Super Easy Miso Ramen Soup from Scratch (No MSG!),MrWalkingTarget,27,8,12,"Seriously. There is no reason to ever use pre-prepared

1. A protein base: Niboshi (Cured Dried Sardines)

2. Kombu: big sheets of dried kelp. Again, not Japan.   

3. Miso: White miso is preferable if making actual miso soup. If you're making miso ramen it's a bit more of a broad interpretation and personal taste. I prefer red miso for spicy dishes and full on tarry black miso in very small quantities if i'm doing anything with root veggies and beef. White miso I find to be the best choice for basic ramen with veggies or ramen with seafood as it doesn't overpower the other flavors. 

The Protien + Kombu make Daschi soup stock

The recipe below is a basic guideline; I tend to only make this when i'm cooking for at least 2 people

Technique:

Step 1: Saucepan + Cold Water and Bring to Boil

Step 2: Add your Kombu. I suggest a palm-sized piece for every quart of water

Step 4: Remove from heat

I don't use niboshi

Step 5: Strain through a metal sieve, you can just pick the Kombu out, but again, personal preference. Reserve about 1/2 cup of this broth per person. 


Step 6: This is where you want to return it to the heat, sesame, green onion)

Step 7:  Use the reserved broth to cream the miso in a small bowl and stir in. Transfer to your bowl(s), etc. 


Congrats. You just made from-scratch Miso Ramen Soup

*the Kombu naturally contains the precursor to MSG

I based this off the spirit of the ""Cooking with Dog"" Yakibuta ramen recipe. Some time in the future I'd love to give the Momofuku noodle bar broth base a whirl, but it's so time consuming to reproduce it'll have to wait until I have some serious down time. if anyone is in NYC I would suggest they also check out ""Ramen Setagaya"" on 2nd ave. It's not as expensive, lacks a massive to wait to get inside, and in my opinion is more lovely.

www.ramensetagayany.com

Anyway, scallions, diakon radish, a soft boiled egg marinated in mirin and soy with white sesame seeds (from this morning), the rested and sliced pork butt, and salmon teriyaki accompany the ramen. It came out pretty good! The teriyaki recipe is pretty basic btw; soy sauce, lemon juice, jaggery (I make a lot of indian food at home). Just pan seared it and spooned the sauce on top until it thickened up. Yum.

They taste sort of doughy and don't have the springiness you would expect from ramen. There are a few Oriental groceries nearby I could visit to pick up some more exotic brands

The soup base is not a HUGE deal for me since  I usually season with random stuff I have in my fridge, does anyone know if there is a ramen brand that has good quality ramen noodles for non premium ramen prices? I think Sapporo Ichiban is better, but I have no idea about Top Ramen.

From what I can tell Maruchan's cup noodles use a different noodle than their brick ramen that has better texture

I had a website and application suggestion for you all to check out:

Website: [The Ramen Database](http://ramendb.supleks.jp/)

[Ramen Map application](http://www.appannie.com/app/ios/ramen-map/)

The website:
This website is the ramen nerds guide to ramen here in Japan.  Showing what's trending
Thing is that it's in Japanese.
But it's pretty easy to get the hang of once you learn the basic Japanese words.  Also

The Ramen Map application:
This free application is tied to the before mentioned website.  It's cool because it can track where you are and show you ramen shops around you.  And they continently color the shop locations for you on the google map to show their ranking. (Red location=high ranking

Sadly both these items chiefly work only here in Japan. 
But if you live here and love ramen give it a try!
If you are visiting also give it a try!
Studying Japanese?  Why not enjoy it too!

TL;DR:
The website and application are great tools for finding ramen in Japan!

I live in Bellevue, and the largest pan-Asian supermarket around here is Uwajimaya between Seattle's Chinatown and the rest of downtown. There's also a smaller Bellevue branch of Uwaji, but they don't have quite as extensive a selection, and I haven't found what I'm looking for in that branch either :(

Anyway, and try a new instant-bowl of a brand I didn't recognize. I'm trying to find one of my favorite brands from back then, but Uwaji doesn't seem to stock it anymore.

I'd thought all instant-ramen was just a block of noodles and a packet of flavor-powder and *maybe* dried vegetables *if lucky.* I grew up on Cup Noodles and Top Ramen and Maruchan

This was a tonkotsu variety - a large bowl perhaps 7-8"" in diameter, which was a first for me at the time.
