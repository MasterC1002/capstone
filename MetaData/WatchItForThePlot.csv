So I'd like to start this thread so we can accumulate shows that have a good plot.     

Please suggest a show (or shows) that you think have the best plot **and** please also include how frequently the plot points come up - this is obviously going to be subjective, please put this in numbers: 1 for plot every episode, two if every other episode (on an average), 3 for once in 3 episodes, etc. 

Also would be nice to specify whether there's regular nudity in the show or not. I'll start: 

Two and a half men - 2
Californication - 1
Charmed - 4
Modern family - 2
