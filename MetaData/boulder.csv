But seriously, Boulder needs CU to survive. Sure students who come here like to party but do you blame them?! 20 something year olds in the most beautiful town in the country trying to get laid, yes they are going to party. But the negativity towards them is unnecessary, if you dont want to deal with them then dont live on The Hill. I am in my late 50's and still enjoy seeing the students have a good time because I know what it is like to be that age. Whenever someone mentions they are coming to boulder the most popular post is always ""But the students drag it down"" Well this is a rant but I hope people can start to understand why they make our town special.

Go Buffs

As you know
like the disruptive
CU-Boulder campus to end. With this in mind
this year to end 4/20.

We invite students who do not have Friday afternoon classes to attend the free
Wyclef Jean concert at the Coors Events Center
Government (CUSG) in partnership with Program Council.

The concert is for CU-Boulder students only. Doors open at 2 p.m. and will
close at 4 p.m. The concert is expected to end at 6 p.m. More information on
the concert will be e-mailed to students in coming weeks
for upcoming announcements.

We also want to communicate some key changes and conditions that may impact you
or your peers on 4/20:

-- Tickets will be issued for smoking marijuana on the Norlin Quad
on campus
a $100 fine.

-- Possession of a medical marijuana card does not entitle its holder to smoke
marijuana on campus

-- Alcohol policies will be strictly enforced throughout the campus.

-- Students who receive tickets will be subject to a review process with the
Office of Student Conduct and if a student is found responsible
be issued.  Additional sanctions will be levied by the Boulder County and
Boulder City courts.

-- The federal Clery Act requires that the university maintain a publicly
accessible crime log. Those ticketed or arrested for violating CU rules and
state or local laws will have their names posted on the CU-Boulder police
website's daily crime log

-- All classes and academic activities will go on as scheduled.

-- Please do not invite friends or visitors to campus that day. Those not
affiliated with CU-Boulder are advised to avoid the campus entirely on 4/20.

-- Plan ahead since extremely heavy traffic and long traffic jams are expected
on Broadway due to construction and along 28th Street due to overflow traffic.
University and City of Boulder guest parking will be virtually non-existent on
the CU-Boulder campus and in adjacent CU neighborhoods.

Please join the CU Student Government and the University in taking key steps
this year to end this disruptive
campus. Your degree has value and your safety and your future matter to all of
us who are proud of the University of Colorado Boulder.

Sincerely

Deb Coffin

1. Continued Ad Hominem attacks (post-warning) will result in a 3-day ban.

We're having a meetup on Saturday

The over 21 crowd can pre-party at
[the Upslope Brewery](http://upslopebrewing.wordpress.com/) at 5 o'clock with some of our AMAZING local Boulder beers.

At 7, 10 arcade tokens, 1 maze run, and 2 batting cage tokens (40 pitches).  Because we got a party package, we can purchase additional activities (like go-karts) at a discount.

When we are not off playing games

Last Friday afternoon I, and staff received your memo about the upcoming campus access restrictions on April 20th.  The memo warned that only those with a valid CU Buff card would be allowed onto campus, with security check points at major entrances to enforce this rule. I find this policy to be an egregious violation of the rights of those affiliated with CU-Boulder, the Boulder community at large, and the core mission of the university.

The annual “4/20” event on campus might be a source of embarrassment to the administration of the university

As a graduate researcher part of my job to further the University’s goals of research excellence is regular collaborations with other scientists at other institutions and in industry. Symposia and other talks regularly occur on Fridays with many off-campus affiliates. CU-Boulder also hosts user research facilities whose mission is to provide access to equipment to researchers both in and outside of CU-Boulder
The administration has implemented a registration system to allow access to campus for people that have business with the university

I am very disappointed that my institution has decided to go this route to stop a protest that is otherwise only a minor inconvenience. On April 20th I encourage CU-Boulder student


Sincerely

A concerned member of the CU-Boulder research community.",self,t5_2qyl3,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/boulder/comments/scp3u/an_open_letter_to_university_of_colorado_boulder/

I spoke with the folks at 303 today and since they don't serve food there (and their normal food truck won't be there) they are totally fine with us bringing our own food or ordering delivery.  Based on the recent post about delivery options, if you think you might get the munchies, bring your own food or be prepared for an (easy) group order.
_____


Happy Holidays

I think it would be fun to get together at the Boulder Distillery to share the holiday cheer.  Let's do this.
****


**Where:  [303 Vodka / Boulder Distillery](http://303vodka.com/boulderdistillery/)** 2500 47th Street

**When:  Saturday

**But wait

We will do the dreaded **[""white elephant"" gift exchange.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_elephant_gift_exchange)**  *(Try to contain your excitement...)*  Around 6 - 6:30 we will pick numbers to determine the order of gift choosers.  A gift can be nabbed up to 3 times.  It can be something from around your house or something you get special for this occasion.  Reddit memes are encouraged but any white elephant will do.  There is no minimum or maximum money limit for the gifts.  You definitely don't have to participate in the exchange if you want to come to the meetup

We are looking into having some food delivered while we are there.  Does anyone have any good food delivery suggestions?  Is there food close by or otherwise available?  I'll update this post during the week with some specifics about getting some grub while we sample some of the delicious 303 spirits.

Some friends and I will be sharing a cab home.  It is about a 20 minute walk from 28th and Pearl and about 7 minutes by bike.  Feel free to post here if you want to discuss carpooling options with other redditors.

***Super Internet Nerds option:*** Wear your tackiest holiday outfit / gear / sweater!   There will be a prize given for the tackiest holiday attire.

And *last but not least* we will have a sign near us for your locating pleasure.


Hope to see you there!

Today's especially good for viewing because it is clear as a bell out there. The spot to look is azimuth 317° (the northwest) and a bit over 3° above the horizon. From just east of Boulder (in the ""L"" corridor) the mountains rise about 1.5°

Tips for seeing it:

* Get out of Boulder! Boulder is down in a valley with the northwest horizon blocked by glorious mountains. Head east
* Avoid light pollution! Seek out a spot that's not a supermarket parking lot. I recommend either of Valmont Road out by 95th
* Bring magnification! A pair of binoculars will do. Better yet a camera with a zoom/telephoto lens. Best yet a proper telescope.

Due to popular request this has spawned a meetup.

They seem to be interested in something on pearl street later on. Most of the replies here have been in response to my suggestion of Boulder Beer mid to late afternoon. I see no reason why we can't please both crowds.

I'll be going to Boulder Beer at 4pm

I've long been curious what a random sampling of local redditors would be like--and I've been working at home exclusively since moving to Boulder

Oskar Blues [was suggested](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/cw7tz/i_am_utterly_terrified_to_drive_down_this_street/c0vrrn0), Boulder. If the local crowd wants to hike up to Longmont, I'll follow along, at least the first time, though I think we'd have a better turn-out for a Boulder meet-up if we met in Boulder. I'm on the south end of Boulder myself, so it's close to 40 minutes to get anywhere in Longmont from here. If anyone has any Boulder venue suggestions, feel free to post them in the comments. 

My thoughts are that a good venue would allow for a flexible sized gathering

I'm free on Monday or Tuesday evenings (except for the first Monday of any month). For this first meet-up I could meet on an August Wednesday, but you're on your own for organizing it. 

And if it goes well

**[EDIT]** I stared an announcement-only Google group for [Boulder redittor meet-ups](http://groups.google.com/group/boulder-redditors). No spam; just an announcement of any Boulder-area redditor meet-ups. Likely no more than 1-2 messages a month

Thoughts? Ideas? Suggestions?

**[EDIT 2]** Looking like this Monday or Tuesday are tied. I think this time around I'm going to say ̶T̶̶u̶e̶s̶d̶a̶y̶, I'm willing to give it a try, but the **Walnut Brewery** allegedly has good food *and* beer, and as such has my vote.

Get your final votes or comments in

* First and foremost, but with the fire and smoke I suggest driving in.
* Remember that you are basically a car out there. Just much smaller and more vulnerable. Pay attention to traffic signals
* Give yourself a little extra time tomorrow morning. This is not only because biking in is likely to take some more time, make sure that the chain can move under that heavy coat of rust. I would suggest taking it to a bike shop, but it is 9 pm the night before so you might have to just risk it.
* Have your path planned out. Stay off of the heavy traffic roads that you usually drive in and instead find something simple with a wide shoulder or even better find a bike path. In Boulder you can get basically anywhere on the bike path system. Don't believe me? [This is the path system](http://www.bouldercolorado.gov/files/GOBoulder/maps/Master_Bike_Map_20111201_reduced.pdf) you have to work with tomorrow. Use it well.
* No one will judge you for taking the bus half way. I'm not suggesting that you are all completely out of shape
* Finally, tire levers, and pump if you have it. These things will save your ass and if you find yourself in that situation where you have a flat and don't know how to fix it, find some passing cyclist and ask for help. If they are anything like me they'll be glad to help.

I could probably throw more in but it's getting late and redundant. If anyone is riding in from Lafayette tomorrow

We have a reservation for r/Boulder at Gateway Fun Park on Saturday, 10 arcade tokens, 1 maze run, and 2 batting cage tokens (40 pitches).  Because we got a party package, we can purchase additional activities (like go-karts) at a discount.  Just go to the counter and tell them that you are there for the Reddit meetup.  When we are not off playing games, we will try to keep the group centered around the picnic tables at the *front* of the park.  You don't have to buy a wristband; you can just come and hang out with us at the tables.  (We will *not* be in the picnic shelter - there is another party going on in there.)

For the local beer lovers (!):  We will be meeting up **before** the Fun Park at 5 o'clock at the [Upslope Brewery.](http://upslopebrewing.wordpress.com/)

All three are active, and I've known two of them for over 20 years. They're also all a bit dorky/nerdy and as happy to crash on the couch and watch ""Buffy"" as they are to go hiking.  They're all 25-26 years old.

Lady #1 is a child psychologist (masters degree) who is finally ready to settle down. She just moved back to Boulder with her two cats, too! She's ready for a long-term, committed relationship if she finds the right guy. She's reliable, stable, and has a great sense of humor. Oh, and she can play the good Jewish girl for the parents of any good Jewish boys out there, especially if you play the part for her mom

At 5'8"" she's hoping for a taller guy, honest, and not afraid of real life (ie stays calm and keeps his sense of humor when things don't go as planned).  

Lady #2 is applying to physics education research PhD programs at the moment, but is far more cat-like than Lady #1's cats. She's vegetarian but seriously doesn't care what other people eat. Her family is Jewish, but her mom is very new-age and she herself is skeptical of religion.  She sits with Lady #3 and me sometimes but wouldn't consider herself Buddhist.

She needs a stable, she wants someone who can gracefully handle the ups and downs of life, no drama!  Empathy is very important to her as well, as she isn't always good at knowing when she needs support (she focuses too much on other people's emotions and forgets about her own).  If you like to take charge and plan dates, she'll adore you for it!  

Lady #3 took a couple years off between high school and college to work for a renowned dressage (horseback riding) trainer, rock climbing, hiking, and exploring if she could! She's really fun, and funny, and surprisingly well grounded. She can be a bit disorganized, but keeps her space clean. She has a ball python and is rehabbing her old, and loves all animals.

She doesn't really know what she wants yet

You know - I wasn't too thrilled when Lycurgus pulled kind of a dick move in the way he made me a mod.  I ended up meeting him at an r/Denver meetup and we had several drinks before he fessed up to his user name.  I got to give him some well deserved shit.  Either way

1316490900.0,kl8ld,I made a new Boulder subreddit for all the fuzzy ones out there...,,21,9,12,"Here's how it started:  After one of the last meetups, I waited until the next day when some more rational people might be looking at the board and submitted it then in hopes that it would stick that time and it did.  I've seen numerous posts go invisible on the r/Boulder front page because of two or three downvotes.  I've approached other moderators and the administrators and it doesn't seem like there is much that can be done about it.  I put a note in the sidebar to remember to check out the ""new"" posts because they still show up there.

****

I don't have a problem with things being downvoted.  It's probably against reddiquette to downvote for the reasons these folks are using, let'em downvote until their heart is content.  But what I don't like is the affect that it has on everyone else's ability to readily see the posts. r/Boulder won't show posts on the front page that are at zero votes or below.  Lame!  Most of this stuff isn't even my cup of tea ... I just don't like to see this stuff get silenced to a degree and thought this might help.

****

So I thought about it and there are some certain types of posts that seem to always get downvoted, social activities can be hard to get past those downvotes ... and my poor sweet little picture of the innocent people at Avery Brewing... three tries and one day later, the group finally got to see it while the troll was sleeping.

****

And I'd like to apologize now for the lower than normal quality of my writing; I'm super tired.

****

I created Boulder Uncut as a place for the socializing Boulderites to go and post about whatever heathen topics they want.  Don't like to talk about weed?  Don't go there.  Don't care if we all want to meet up for a beer?  Don't go there.  Does the thought of other people having fun upset you?  Join us!  We're mostly the same way!  And if you can't do that for whatever reason ... don't go to the page.

****

There we will be Wild Hairs of the Boulder persuasion.

****

This isn't intended to replace the meetups and other social discussions that happen on r/Boulder.  This will allow us to now include broader discussions that may involve things that the general population find to be undesirable

****

I think r/Boulder and r/BoulderUncut will work nicely together.  Want to put up a personal ad?  Do it!  Your soul mate may be a subscriber.  Is your band playing somewhere?  Promote it!  Ents - want something?  What is it you want anyways.  Probably Cheetos at this time of night.  Tell us what you want Boulder Ents - this is here for you too.


****

I'll post a link around r/Boulder to remind people it exists.  It could go inactive after a bit or it could flourish.  I'm probably going to continue to dink around with the CSS on there just to see what all I can do.  Make it yours.  The world is our uncut oyster.  Okay ... I'm cheesing out

I figured I'd try y'all before the randomness that is CL

- Roommate moved out recently to move into another house with an early lease date, http://www.flatironviewapartments.com/, complex also has a pool if you're into swimming
- tbqh I rather like the location
- Rent per person is $500/month (June would be prorated if you choose to move before July) plus utilities
- Unit was renovated right before we moved in last winter
- I'm a mid twenties male, exercising (&lt;3 road bike), and socializing. 
- I'm out of the house fairly often for either work (I just started my own company so I'm zipping around quite often) or pleasure so if you need your space that shouldn't be a problem at all!
- Only thing I really would have a problem with is parties being hosted at the apartment, :)

September, and we'll use the one with the most votes. I'm starting in mid-September so that we'll be able to give everyone at least a couple weeks notice.

As to location: Last time we were at a bar in downtown Boulder, we wouldn't have fit very well. And, based on what I'm hearing, there may be a lot more people this time around.

Basically, give 3 tickets to me so I can have 7 beers... whatever you want to do).  We'll all ride together on a Greyhound style bus to the bout, watch the game, and then ride back to the brewery (it will be closed by the time we get back so no after-after party).  

Other details:

My best advice to anyone wanting to watch roller derby is to learn the rules.  It's not all of the show and drama anymore - people fancy it as a sport


* 
Tickets to the October 1st bout aren't on sale yet and won't go up until after the bout next weekend.  [But

This Saturday I wanted to do an epic mountain bike ride that basically spans a good number of the trails in Boulder. Starting at the Marshall Mesa, then riding up 36 to Heil Ranch, going down Picture Rock, doing a quick up and down through Hal Ranch, back down 36 to where we got off the Foothills so we an hit the Eagle trail, then a bit of road riding over to the White Rocks trail that will spit you out on Valmont Road. A quick spin through the Valmont bike park then off to Boulder Beer to finish off the day.

I mostly just wanted to check if anyone wanted to join me on this or had any suggestions to make it better. I had a brief thought to add Walker Ranch into it but that just seemed way too stupid for my liking. Batasso was another thought but sadly that trail is closed on Saturdays.

1. Does not serve food or have a kitchen
2. Dark
3. Opens 11am or earlier
4. Bartenders are often surly or just not interested
5. Never any type of wait staff
6. Likely do not accept credit cards
7. Frequented by townies and only the occasional student

Think of Lions Lair or Nob Hill in Denver for comparison. 

So... Does Boulder have any dive bars of this definition? Thank you very much for your insight.
