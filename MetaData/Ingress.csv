I recognize Chevy Impala headlights and start to think how I'm going to explain to the officer what I'm doing at 2 in the morning.

He walks up and asked if that is my car. Yes. He says they got a call about someone here earlier, he flips his phone around to face me showing the Ingress app open showing the surrounding streets. ""You mean this game?"" he asks. I  stare in awe for a moment and then we both laugh. We stand and talk about Ingress, our city, and phones for 20 minutes while I establish my fields. I come to find that we had talked a couple times before in our G+ community and that when he saw my car in the parking lot he remembered I had said that I was on my way here and decided to stop by. 
We walk back to our cars, he to continue his patrol until 6 AM. 

I love this game.

 Be careful about the language you use when playing ingress.

I am more than guilty of saying ""I'm gonna go blow up some blue portals"" etc... but in light of yesterdays tragic events we in the Boston Ingress community were reminded that such language can be overheard and misinterpreted by the public at large. With the numerous ""see something say something"" campaigns it is just worth  being a little more careful as it distracts from the real dangers out there.

As for us.  Many have declared a voluntary ""ceasefire"" for the day soas not to distract the police from any investigations they are performing.

This is a quick list of things that might help you stay out of trouble.
 
* It is important to remember that you are doing nothing wrong and that you do not intend to do anything wrong or illegal.
* Know the game. Know how it works. Be able to explain what it is. Mention that it's made by Google. Google is a buzz word that people know. Mention that it's being played by thousands of people all over the world. This will likely be new to them. They will have no idea what you are talking about. Be patient with them. Never get frustrated with their questions.
* Stay calm. Do not look guilty or shifty. Smile and keep the mood light.
* Always be extremely polite. Talk to them as if they are your friend. Make them feel like you are on their side of the situation. And yes, the police would rather tell you to move along than arrest you.
* DO NOT MENTION THE WORDS HACKING. If you are showing them the game
* If they feel like you've genuinely made a mistake they will likely just tell you to move along and not to return. If the do that, We can go?"" and if they say, ""Yes."" or wave you along or whatever, pack up your stuff an go. You may technically have a right to be there and you aren't doing anything wrong, but there is no winning when arguing with a cop, especially at night.
 
**==== IMPORTANT ====**

**Trespassing at night**

*Every one who, loiters or prowls at night on the property of another person near a dwelling-house situated on that property is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction.*
 
*Trespassing at night* is an actual law in Canada. It is written in the books as above. What it means is that just being on a person's lawn at night gives the right to police to question you. You might not get arrested (though it's possible) you'll still have to deal with them and they will be a more aggressive  with you than if you are just loitering on the street. Essentially

**Remember there is no reason to start a fight or an argument with the police over a game. You don't need to ""fight for your rights"" or ""stand your ground against authority"", but there are more portals throughout the town/city and you are wasting time letting the other team win if you are tied up with the police.**

I clandestinely hid out and replaced all of my resonators. Then he moved to a different one and I went inside a building and did the same because he switched to his other account when his first ran out of bursters and XM.

I heard about Ingress from the comments of another thread (I can't remember the thread, so I'll be down in the list.""  20 minutes later, I get the email that says I'm in and to start setting everything up.

I got a rush of excitement as well as a bit of fear, claimed it and figured out the basics.  I didn't know that it would broadcast the announcement of claiming my first portal, but it did and then the notifications popped up of people congratulating me and it felt...good.

I started talking with some of the people in comms and explaining my situation a bit and everyone was so nice, offering to help me level if I was ever around their neck of the woods.  It was nice to see people being helpful and supportive around me.  In the short time I've been playing I've made a few friends with people around my area and even got a few of my other friends involved and now we go out a couple times a week to farm or to poke at the opposing factions portals (we're pretty low level in a rather fortified area of opposition).

For all this

tl:dr - Thank you Niantic

* In the future, a ""rock paper scissors"" dynamic. A lot of room for exploration.

* Talked about how they deal with cheating right now. NIA OPS and an automated algorithm that detects cheating. Proprietary stuff. Combination of human investigation and technical tools, the better they can deal with it.

He is now much more careful but still makes a few mistakes.  


I really wouldnât mind it so much if he didnât cover multiple towns with a single field


I knew he was gps spoofing, and of course he denied it saying I had no proof.  Well he was correct, I had no proof.  But now I do.  Here is your fucking proof.


To make this happen, likely in the JSON data.  (BTW, player locations are no longer reported in the JSON data, only portal locations.)  I used Wireshark to capture the relevant data.  Here is an example: [Wireshark](http://i.imgur.com/oIdQm)


The highlighted field


[Example 1.](http://i.imgur.com/3wY3M) My fellow resistance member, which converts to 11/21, 22:49:41.  [Next](http://i.imgur.com/dBP9P) is Harrisburg, which is at 1353560054923.  It converts to 11/21 22:54:14.  According to Google Maps, the drive should take 1 hour 10 minutes.  He made it in about 5 minutes.


The next [example](http://i.imgur.com/7vB9E) is of the tlp09 account.  [Here](http://i.imgur.com/GHnKo) is the Wireshark capture from Harrisburg at 1354499216673, it takes 32 minutes.  He made it in 11.


This next example is the most apparent of all
[First](http://i.imgur.com/5p9ID), 11/26 01:19:08.  17 minutes later, Damagickid [appeared](http://i.imgur.com/dwm65) in St. Louis, MO at 1353915385259, 11/26 01:36:25.  He stopped at 01:42, and 2 minutes later [switched](http://i.imgur.com/LdEZY) to tlp09 at 1353915890555, 11/26 01:44:50.


I saw this one the night it happened, it would have been a mix of them both taking portals, not dozens of activities from one immediately followed by dozens of activities from the other.  Further evidence that it is the same person can be found on Damagickids Youtube page, where you can find that his initials are actually tlp.  


Later that same day, who is also an enlightened player, and must therefore have been a mod.  For quite a while after the Damagickid account disappeared I assumed he had been banned.  I just recently realized what had happened.  He did a faction change and name change on the account, which is now known as heiscoming.  The following three screenshots show that heiscoming is the owner of three portals along with the dates he took them.  [One](http://i.imgur.com/0U1Du) [Two](http://i.imgur.com/vmFtx) [Three](http://i.imgur.com/UpW5v)


The only person active on those days was Damagickid.  There is nothing in the logs that shows heiscoming ever deploying a single resonator.  As far as I can tell


Until Google finds a way to stop this sort of thing there doesnât really seem to be a point in playing.  I may continue to play in my own town for now


Check out Southern Illinois on the map to see what Iâm dealing with.  To my Illinois friends


All of my screenshots can be verified by looking at the JSON data.  These are just a few examples


To those of you out there dealing with cheaters of your own


Viva la resistance!

Looking at the code from the APK

Basically, then the maximum link distance is multiplied by a factor of:

    total_multiplier / num_amplifiers * diminishing_returns[num_amplifiers] / 1000

instead of just 1000.

1356203322.0,15ahb3,I'm done with Ingress for a while,sparr,140,58,94,"Ingress appealed to me a lot. Augmented Reality Games are interesting to me

1) There are a lot of territory-capturing games out there that involve connecting nodes/flags/portals/whatever together. A core premise that Google has missed here is that of ""front lines"" and ""safe areas"". There should be clearly defined and obvious areas of conflict, or where there are [potential] connections between nodes of opposite alignment. In Ingress, considering how fields are defined, non-border portals could easily be defined as portals that are completely surrounded by fields. If attacks and/or hacks on such non-border portals were disallowed, or greatly discouraged or made less effective or incentivized, then players could put a lot more thought and effort into planning defensive perimeters and avenues of attack. Another potential definition would be portals that you could link from, which is to say you could only attack portals that, you have the range (and key?) to link them to an existing friendly portal. Allowing one high level player to travel directly to the center of enemy territory and attack important portals with impunity removes a lot of potential strategy and tactics from the game.

2) The puzzle solving and code collecting part of the game is fundamentally broken. ""Media"" in the game is almost always useless by the time it is collected (because the associated puzzle has already been solved)

3) The interface to the game is annoyingly split. There is no reason to not provide access to the Intel Map information from within the mobile app. Players who can switch between the game and a browser

4) The game encourages unsafe and irresponsible behavior. Playing while driving is the most efficient approach, etc. One weak but simple solution that comes to mind is to limit in-game character movement to a certain speed. If you drive somewhere, then you have to wait for your character to walk (or take some futuristic slow transportation system) there. Some allowance would need to be made for very long distance travel, such as driving or flying between cities, but this would mostly eliminate the situations where people are driving across cities and playing from their vehicles. This artificial travel system could take territory control into account.

5) There is too little interaction between players. Even when standing next to each other, but it seems obvious that there should be some notification if I'm standing next to a resonator or portal that is under attack. Equally, if I'm attacking and someone is defending, I should be able to interact with that person somehow.

6) There is too much grinding, and 99% of my actions would involve virtually no decision making or risk. As far as I can tell, the only decisions in the game that actually matter are where I spend my time, which portals to link, which resonators to upgrade/recharge, and what order to travel to portals in. Even worse, most of that grinding time is just waiting. Something as simple as a minigame for hacking would help with this, where every game action was a minigame, etc.",t5_2vij9

* Portal corrections (relocation, etc) should start being processed soon. They've been on hold while they prioritized moving through the massive backlog of new portal submissions

* Portals that have been rejected due to proximity to a portal will probably not be re-reviewed automatically if the 'blocking' portal is later moved or removed as part of a correction. They're looking in to it

* They also noted that in the case of some rejected portals the approval team, police stations, hospitals are no longer accepted for related reasons), or showed Portals behind chain link fences or padlocked gates (could indicate it's not publicly accessible)."" - so that's a helpful bit of info.

They are all within easy walking distance

As I get to the cathedral, ski mask and ski goggles. Obviously a hardcore ingresser, and I soon recognize him from previous encounters around Oslo. Meeting him today could surely ruin my mood! I mange to take down the links on the cathedral, but constant counter deployment makes a portal takedown impossible. I rush to the central station, barely managing to get some of the fields there. Now I sprint to the Opera roof because I'm all out of XM, and I need a lot to take down the fortress of four level 6 portals which awaited. After just a few shots, it becomes clear that I do not possess the energy to pull off the feat at the Opera, I have to keep in mind the bus is leaving in about 40 minutes

I find a mall which has openings in both ends, which is perfect for me. I start sprinting towards the stairs, jump the railing and fall about 3 meters down, get up and sprint through the crowd, around a corner outside the mall and into some construction site that's obscured from inside view.

I run for like 2 minutes, turning my jacket inside out, taking my hat and my gloves off and I go back out carrying my backpack on the stomach or in a hand by my side to keep my earlier profile as obscured as I can. I take a long way around back to the Opera, walk out onto the roof, and no Enlightened on blasted bikes are to be seen.

Standing in the middle of nasty green fields and huge portals, lots of fields going with them. I'm still not level 8! I click the level icon in my scanner and find that I'm just a few thousand shy of level 8! I start deploying resonators and shields on the now free portals after a small wave around the roof to gather some XM. Placing the _last_ shield in the second portal I finally see the number in the upper left corner turning to 8, and I start cheering! People are looking at me like I'm an idiot, and I just throw back the biggest smiles!

I go back into the central station

Later I get told by the Enlightened fellow on g+ that he had gotten the notifications from me taking down the portals

**I don't blame them

The only incentives to create fields right now is to earn AP for yourself, now all you have is the cost deterrent of wasting precious portal keys.

Why waste a key to earn worthless 'MU' points that doesn't help your team's local struggle for control? Ownership of portals is what most players fight over. The fields are just dressing.

**The point of the game for most players isn't to get MUs

MUs are too broad and wide of a concept to appeal to the average player. There's currently 18 million MUs per team. The most any player in our area has made from a link is 32k, no incentive, aside from seeing the map covered in your color.

The incentive for holding portals is much greater. You can farm them for equipment

This is called 'emergent behavior'. When players find the way they want to play the game is more fun than the way the game is intended to play. It's a common concept in game design

He stopped, I just felt the car pulling to one side and wanted to check my tires, which looked fine.

Things to remember when talking to authorities:

Avoid using the words ""hack"", ""blast"", and (sometimes) ""takeover"". 

Many law enforcement agencies have a list of key words (and synonyms) that

I've been playing for several months as a legitimate Ingress player and I got to L8 a few months ago. I got bored and thought that I'd see what it's like to be a GPS spoofer

I started 5 days ago, but I just had to write this down.

So how hard can it be? Let me tell you about the state of play for the GPS spoofer ...

* it is very easy to GPS spoof. I can go anywhere and it's dead stable. I use an ""off the shelf"" app. I am not an Android developer or 1337 h@x0r.

* Niantic limit your maximum speed between portals

* I can farm with ease so I can get myself a lot of items

* farming for keys still sucks

* I can remotely drop items for other players

* I can't defend a portal from being attacked by a strong player. I could deploy resonators, it pick up any dropped keys in the area.

* That XM cost and link defence is a real killer. In the bad old days, even when spoofing, is time consuming. Cubes are rare, and so is XM. When attacking a portal as a spoofer, I have to jump to other portals, collect xm, and jump back. This is one thing that Niantic should fix to **KILL SPOOFING DEAD**. Don't allow spoofers to jump to xm pools! Apply the same instant travel rules to XM as you do to hacking/dropping/picking-up.

* Since attacking portals is now very time consuming, so they suspect anything that doesn't fit that model. They/we had it really easy.

I had people chatting to me ALL the time

Let me tell you

* spoofing is not social

* The attack notification is great for anti-spoofing! People come running to the portal

* Player Tracker plugin for IITC is a spoofing killer as well. People can easily see if you are doing anything ""strange"". But IITC is against the ToS


On the topic of the morality of spoofing

* will accept spoof-farmed items items
* have multiple accounts
* use IITC + plugins
* use their under-18 family members as pack mules and force multipliers
* give items to enemies. I've done this as ""goodwill"" when meeting the opposing forces. It's ""diplomacy"" but it's agains the ToS (as they stand).
* win-trade
* inform and spy ... 

So you either abide by all the ToS or none of them

EDIT: i.e. you can't pick and choose which rules you want to abide by and which ones you want to break. if you break one of the rules

But, and I don't think it does that much damage. It's noise, it hasn't killed the game.

I wouldn't worry about spoofers too much. They might be annoying

At least

One playing in particular - Let's call him Evilman (a portmanteau of his handles) has been shameless in his cheating for months now

-He has changed his name at least 3 times (in spite of a limit of one name change per player. No idea how he managed this).
-He regularly spoofs his location
  -He has often taken portals in the middle of an empty field
-We can't prove it
-He reports others for harassment/spoofing/whatever he thinks may stick
-When caught (someone defends a portal he is attacking, he immediately breaks off the attack and moves several blocks away, only to return 20 minuets later when he assumes the others have moved on (hint: we haven't. we're waiting and watching).

I could even forgive Evilman for some of this, but this has gone on unabated for months and month.

The icing on the cake was his willingness to deny AP to the rest of his team. Naturally he was one of the first local Greenies to hit level 8

I think the drop rate of both is equal

I don't want to change the game too deeply (meaning I don't think changing the drop rates and/or XMP power is a good idea)

A single L1 resonator contains in itself 1'000 XM, instead of dropping hundreds of unused resonators... could we, for example, break them to get a little bit of that XM ? I mean, a level 1 res contains in itself 1k XM. I'm sure it would be possible to break it to get a bit of XM, don't you think ? I don't know, for example, like 10 times the res' level.

Just wanted to open a discussion based on the fact that I think every city should have a ""noob battleground"".  In our city, but they should always have level 1 resonators.

Of course this is meant for people who are just started and a little blown away by level 4 and 5 portals all over the place. I understand

If we can keep a battleground like this in major cities - it encourages low level players to go out, and start leveling - which in turn keeps their interest levels up, game moving, and higher level opponents in the long run.

Some people might not dig this.  Some cities are just out for blood with  regards to the game.  Our city has gone with this

1. It would be nice to see a wider area on the mobile app. Something similar

2. Satellite Overlay. Just like on the Intel page. I would totally love this.

3. My personal favorite - Google Now Integration! It would be so nice to be able to have 'cards' pop up when you are within maybe a mile, Faction Owner (or neutral), Map view of the portal(s) and a button to initiate navigation. This would make me happier than a fat kid or cake camp (otherwise, happier than myself)!

**TL;DR:** You're probably not going to hurt your smartphone from voltage-drop using long cables... but may experience problems if you use cheap cables longer than 6'. If you use cheap, or damage the source (charger) from heat, or melt the cable if there's enough amperage and length.


**TL;DR Recommendations:**

 - 5.3v 2.1A - &gt;6' cheap cable may be dicey
 - 5v 2.1A - &gt;3' cheap cable may be dicey
 - 5v 1A - &gt;6' cheap cable may be dicey
 - 5v 0.5A - &gt;10' cheap cable may be dicey
 - Many usb-batteries come with 1A and 2.1A outputs. Switch to 1A if you have a long cheap cable and have problems. Ingress may actually consume more than 1A

(Why you'd be walking around with a 10' cable wrapped up in your pocket, but I guess if you have it lying around...)

Attenuation is voltage drop from the resistance of conductor

(What comes with the iPhone, the device will only get 4.85v to it. However, I'd be very surprised to see a phone that has battery voltage greater than 4v, since most now use USB and have to anticipate this loss.

The Galaxy S4 has 3.8v 2600mah. My iPhone 5 has a 3.8v 1440mah. A voltage regulator / charging circuit takes the voltage from the charging cable (between 4-5v) and converts it to (generally) a usable 3.8v, the charger, to regulate. The USB standard was created and manufacturers have to perform a cost-benefit-analysis of abiding by this standard since it's now the most popular.

The USB standard is 5v, the current is usually governed by the device. They're generally all made in china, many use the same IC, and call it 3.1A / 15W. With cost of production in mind, cheaper components are used (plastics, no thermal paste or heatsink) and are prone to overheating. 

The same goes for cables. Smaller AWG number = thicker the gauge. I have some old 30-pin iPhone connectors here at my desk: the stock one from apple

There is a formula for voltage drop, this would not charge my iPhone if it were greater than 9' long, since it would drop to 3.7v or greater. (And that's why it's at my desk, I bought a 10' cable to rig into my car stereo, but the charger I was using was 2A, caused too much of a drop and was unresponsive.)

If you're dropping below 3.8v (or whatever the charging circuit cuts off, and doesn't attempt to. I seriously doubt that any modern smartphone lacks the capability of cutting off low-voltage current, which would under-volt the battery.

I've made this handy little chart to show the voltage drop (this all assumes copper

My theory is this is an anti cheating countermeasure.  It seems as through Ingress thinks you are cheating so you get sandboxed (thats what i call it).  I have also noticed that if hacking an enemy portal

I have found a way to tell is you are sandboxed:  Goto your inventory and attempt to recharge a friendly portal that needs it.  If your XM goes down and you see green %number over the resonators

Where I play (east TN) there are small clusters that are very dense.  One in particular has 20 portals all within walking distance.  In other areas, I have to forcibly end ingress and relaunch.

I have tried a few things to mitigate this:
-turn off GPS while traveling
-stay under the speed limit (even tried 25% under)
-put phone to sleep while traveling
-kept phone while traveling
-force resync
Nothing seems to keep ingress from putting me in the sandbox. (other than forcibly relaunching the program)

I play rather aggressively

2. You will need multiple keys of portals to get stuff done. So, you will get another one, and then you can pick yours up that you dropped. This will enable you to have multiples to use to link, as well as recharge and possibly pass to your teammates!

Number 2 clarification: You will need multiple keys for this reason: At the moment, then be able to recharge it remotely (as they lose -10% a day), you will need two keys. Three if you wish to link it a second time as part of a triangle.

3. Hit that hack button multiple times! Through possibly a bug

4. Turn that screen brightness down! Do everything you can to conserve battery. Screen brightness is the worst on your battery

5. Unclaimed portals are MUCH easier to deal with than claimed ones. A claimed portal takes 30 or so XMP to bust open, as it is more resource efficent at this time.

6. When attacking a portal, and minimal damage to nearby ones, perhaps 8% in total. If the resonators are inside a building, I hope the building is public, or you will have a hard time taking down the portal, as at the moment, XMP blasts are centered on your current location

7. To gain AP, deploy again. It gives 150 AP per deploying. Just know that you are ""wasting"" shield generators to do this.

I'll edit and add more as I find them

I think a common fear that I've been reading is that once Google has collected more walking data than then know what to do with, and others I'm probably forgetting. *Assuming* that Ingress really takes off, there will inevitably be a time where there is enough walking data collected and user submitted portals will be dense enough ... making portals too dense would be a problem (there are some places around where I live where you can maybe walk a few paces and hit a few portals already). However, I notice there's a big pot o' gold just waiting to be taken for Google: ... Missions. Imagine with me. You're hopping around town, doing your thing, when all of a sudden:

Ingress.

Ever use Google Maps and see a location that is ""approximate""? Ever have Maps ask you if that location was correct? Ever have Maps ask you if that phone number you called was right? Have you ever *really* needed to find a public restroom

Ingress just crowd-sourced it and gathered times, and pictures ... which they can ""Google Goggle"" and pick out logos, or just have a team zipping by approving photos on the fly. Hell, bring back the image game. ""Match keywords with your partner"" I bet you they can take 20 idiots and you pull back ""ATM"" and ""BANK OF AMERICA"" at least 15 times.

Igress ain't going nowhere. So long as there's something out there unlisted, with a generic name, just opened, just closed, or someone tore it down and put a park with walking paths there .... Google wants to know about it. They want to put it on a map, keyword it, give you a phone number

This a Augmented Reality Game where you go to certain locations and ""hack"" them claiming the location for your side. There are two sides in this game ""The Enlightened"" and ""The Resistance""

The story is that during one CERN's scientific experiments created a sort of cascade (a resonance cascade you could say) that released exotic matter around the world, museums, etc. While XM particals have been scattered randomly, but they collect around portals.

Both sides are trying to capture these portals and set up resonance devices around the portals generate more energy from or to I'm not sure) and to link them together. When three or more portals are link it creates a field

The game play is like this:

* You first have to look on the map: http://www.ingress.com/intel (requires login) to find portals like [these]    (http://i.imgur.com/9HLqr.png).    
* You then take you phone with you and  head to the location they are at.   
* Once at the location you must get within 50m of the portal and select then you can hack it.
* When hacked it will give you a Key (allowing you to edit the portal) and other random items (resonators, XM, and AP.
* The next step is to set up Resonators
* you move onto the next and the next till you can set up 8 resonators on each and link them together creating a field like [this](http://i.imgur.com/M3C0v.png)    

When you come across a portal that has already been claimed depending on if its hostile or not you can do a few things. 

* If the portal is hostile you can use a XMP (a bomb) to attack and weaken the portal and their resonators they have set up

* If the portal is friendly to you, regenerate it's energy levels, and link it to other portals.


I hope this clears things up

1360127183.0,17zeh6,[Theorycrafting] Ingress Itemization (Warning: quite long),drusepth,46,15,28,"The [recent Ingress Hangout](http://www.reddit.com/r/Ingress/comments/17ydye/new_info_from_ingress_hangout/) revealed that there are plans in the future to tactically increase the complexity of the game by introducing new shield types, and potentially introducing physical items like NFC bracelets that can hold Ingress items. 

*The inventory and inventory management is also being reworked.*

In other words

Right now items serve one purpose: resonators fill up portals

But what if

*Theorycrafting time.*

**What if Resonators gave abilities to the portal they are deployed on?**

- XM storage: A small amount of XM can be stored in the portal and retrieved by anyone on the team that controls it. If the resonator is destroyed the XM ""drops"" to the map.

- Item storage: Some amount of one kind of item can be stored in the portal and retrieved by anyone on the team that controls it. If the resonator is destroyed the items drop to the ground.

- XM generator: This portal produces more XM.

- Further reach: Increases the maximum distance this portal can link to.

- Luckiness: This portal is more likely to yield more items when hacked (for both teams).

- Movement: This resonator moves around on the map

- Energetic: This resonator has an increased amount of energy.

- Efficient: The efficiency of recharging this resonator from a distance is increased.

- Cooling: This portal's overheated hacking cooldown (normally 3+ hours) is decreased by some small amount.

**What if Shields provided extra defensive abilities to the portal they were deployed on?**

- Fatigue: Enemies who attack this portal suffer from a little extra XM depletion.

- Leeching: XM damage suffered by attackers is leeched to recharge this portal.

- Absorption: This portal will automatically absorb loose XM in its field (on the ground) to recharge itself.

- Evasion: XMPs have an increased chance of missing when targeting this portal.

- Hardened: This shield provides increased damage reduction.

- Regeneration: Resonators on this portal suffer from decay at a much slower rate. Multiple regeneration shields may reverse the effects of decay.

- Disruption: This portal is unaffected by the effects of nearby gadgets.

**What if XMPs provided new damage sources and sources of teamwork?**

- Light: Damage and XM required to use are decreased.

- Heavy: Damage and XM required to use are increased.

- Heated: Damage is increased if the temperature is above a certain threshold.

- Cooled: Damage is increased if the temperature is below a certain threshold.

- Daylight: Damage is increased while the sun is out.

- Midnight: Damage is increased during the night.

- Beginner's luck: Damage is increased the closer the player is to level 1.

- Shield piercing: Attacks ignore all shield abilities.

- Shield breaker: Rather than doing damage to resonators

- Accurate: XMP may be fired from a slightly further distance.

- Preparation: All future damage done to resonators of the portal hit is increased by some small amount for some short period of time.

- Locking: Resonators hit cannot be recharged for some period of time after taking damage from this burster.

- Teamwork: Does slightly more damage for each ally within range of the portal.

- Collaboration: Damage done by allies (not you) to the portal this XMP hits is increased for a short period of time.

- Leeching: All nearby allies regain some XM based on how much damage was done.

- Explosive: Ignites other XMPs fired by allies at the same time

**What if new *Offensive Gadgets* provided new tactical opportunities?**

- XM Bursters: When fired at a location

- Degeneration field: All portals within this field suffer from an increased rate of decay for some period of time.

- Disruption field: For some duration of time

- EMP: Disrupt all targeted portal abilities for a short period of time.

- Caltrops: Players that walk through caltrops lose a little more XM when attacking portals for a short period of time. Caltrops last for some amount of time before being automatically destroyed

**What if new *Defensive Gadgets* provided bonuses for active

- XM generator: Creates a field where XM is generated for some period of time.

- Drop site: A drop site may store one item (from any player) that may be retrieved by any player of either faction. Drop sites can only be seen on the map by players of the faction that owns it

- White field: All damage and XM usage is decreased by some small amount for players within the range of this field

- Heal trap: For a short amount of time, the heal trap is destroyed.

Of course

1355083703.0,14k7xk,Effective Leveling,ottawadeveloper,41,7,17,"I love math. You really gotta love math and science in general. So here's my math revelation today (from my post in a recent thread about leveling).

Leveling in this game is about gaining AP effectively. To gain AP

The question is

Gathering the devices takes time

The game play offers four main strategies for gaining AP:

1. You can focus on destroying control fields. You only gain AP from disrupting control fields and links
2. You can focus on destroying portals completely and simply capturing them with one of your resonators
3. You can focus on completely capturing the portal (for the final bonus and the extra XP
4. You can focus on building networks of portals yourself (#3 + linking)

Let's look at some scenarios and where the better options are:

1. There are no control fields on any portals nearby. If a portal has no control fields on it
2. If you have at least two portals

Whether it is more advantageous to neutralize them or link them together depends on how many control fields you will be destroying and how many you will be rebuilding. I assume

Interestingly though

#3 is only the most efficient option if there are no control fields on the portal and that's true for all the portals you could target. If you have the option to take out a portal with a CF instead

Those are edge cases. Most of the time

#1 is the fastest method, you should be focusing on #1. It takes far less time and has equivalent or greater rewards in many cases (per device used at least). It's also better at higher levels where your bursters are far more powerful - you can bring them under 50% much faster and not use the resonators at all. If you find yourself low on resonators constantly, this is a good strategy.

#4 is better if you are inter-connecting a larger number of portals and/or destroying a smaller number of control fields. Even then, compared to finding an equal number of unlinked portals with the same number of attached CFs and neutralizing them. 

There are tipping points here. Basically the math says we should compare the number of portals you will interconnect (assuming you will fully interconnect them to the maximum potential) to the number of control fields you will destroy

For example, you need 3 CFs per portal, 5 portals need 4CFs, 6 portals need 6 CFs, 7 portals need 8 CFs, 8 portals need 11 CFs, etc. This doesn't include the time factor needed to link everything together (which weighs even further towards #1).

So, then you're better off just neutralizing the portals you come across (look for tight concentrations of portals with lots of CFs attached). ",,False,,t5_2vij9,False,enlightened,

I was searching the Ingress subreddit for a particular gif to make into a Bootloader animation. After a couple hours of reading and downloading various apps

I made it off of this gif.

Once you have your phone hooked up via USB, *do not unzip the file*. The app will draw everything needed from the zip similar to how you flash ROMs onto your phone!

tl;dr steps-

1) Download the App.

2) Download the zip file

3a) With the app: Click on the local tab and find where you put the zip file.

3b) Click on it and click ""Install""

3c) If prompted

4) Reboot

Enjoy! Let me know if any problems come up.

Edit2 - Bad phones are bad and need to have consequences!

I used the recharge ability to try and save some of my remaining resonators in an attempt to preserve the field.    A second Enlightened member started taking hits on the portal..  I had to recharge again...  One more time the Reso's start depleting and I use the last of my XM power to recharge and figure this attack might be bigger then I think.    3 Enlightened were attacking one portal.
    I get on Faction chat and sound an alarm letting others know that the only Resistance fields in the city are going down.   Another Resistance member is on it just as i'm typing.
    I make my way half way across the city collecting XM as I drive
   I arrive on the Legislature grounds

    We all introduce ourselves and shake hands!    I get some feedback on how confusing my remote recharge was for one of the enlightened.   He didn't understand why they kept coming back online!    I tell them I'm off to the other 2 portals about 30meters away to hack them for more items as I hit a 300 second (0h how I hate those) on the current portal i'm standing on.    I head off and they scramble their own way.     As I hack 2 team portals some gentlemen come down the stairs behind me from atop the hill that the government building rests on and ask what side i'm on!  Clearly seeing the blue and greens on my Galaxy S3's screen!     I'm Resistance!

1368452306.0,1e8rl1,Damage Mitigation based on percent of field coverage,Cputerace,35,7,33,"Ever since the beginning of Ingress

The team that is winning Ingress is the one with the most Mind Units, places a huge disincentive for posting fields. Sure, at lower levels creating control fields are the best way to level up, especially knowing that others will come and knock them down quickly, allowing you to re-build them for more points. As players get into the higher levels, however, the benefit of the AP for creating fields is outweighed by the fact that fields are the equivalent of putting a ""Kick Me"" sign on an elementary school kid. It all but guarantees that your farm will get knocked down

Additionally, because someone can just drop a bomb right in the center and get a ton of AP. It is the same problem you see in games like Battlefield 3 whereby you push the other team back to their last spawn point, then one person runs deep into the heart of your control, captures one base, and unrealistically spawns an entire army ""behind enemy lines"".

Niantic took a step towards making things better by adding damage mitigation based on links

I would like to see the link damage mitigation replaced by the following

Damage mitigation for a portal is based on the percent of angle surrounding the portal that contains a field. The wording is a bit confusing, in a perfect equilateral triangle. Each portal has 60 degrees of field, which is 16.6% coverage, therefore the damage mitigation for each of these three portals is 16.6%. Four portals connected in a perfect square would each get 25% damage mitigation.

Initially I thought that mitigation should go to 100% (for portals completely surrounded by fields, and if you try, it will cost a LOT. This would force people to take out the portals on the edge of control first.

The tactics that would spring up from this change would add a whole new level of strategy to the game. Teams would actually be able to control areas,False,,t5_2vij9,False,,resistance,t3_1e8rl1

So anyway, throw my bursts at it and it STILL doesn't fall.  lame.  That's when I saw a car driving slowly, as it passed the driver had his face in his phone!

So I'm done for the night, pull into the parking lot and there's some dude, face down in a tablet!  I hacked it, got another burst, hit it and noticed that he had dropped a shield, it looked like he had just taken the portal and was a level 1 so I picked up the shield, yelled,"" and drove home.

The same when planning and bringing up a massive field that took a week to plan and execute. Same AP as bringing up any shitty field on your home portals.

Should you be awarded extra AP for doing something extra ordinary? 

* Fields create over X MU gives you Y extra AP?
* Bringing down a field over X MU gives you Y extra AP? Player level also taken into account.
* Taking down a portal with resonators above your level gives extra AP?

This to encourage player to do more than farming home portals to reach the next level. To take the bus to the other side of town just to bring down that giant green/blue field.

Starting at L1, you're going to be looking for unclaimed portals.  Use ingress.com/intel, get to know where all your local portals are, and scoop the gray ones.  Also, submit new portals.  You get an email notification the day they go live, and if it's not a busy area you can get to it first.  Portals that are on hiking trails and any place you can't get to with a car are good candidates as well.

Portal keys are pretty useless at this point.  But stock up, and at this level one field is a huge AP score.

If you can find a portal in your area that's always owned by your side

About L3, your weapons will be much less effective until the shields break, and that costs XM, not just weapons.  You won't know how tough it is until you get out there and try it.

This is also the point where you can make portals strong enough to link at a decent range.  A portal with an average resonator level of 2 (two L3s, most clusters of portals are at least that far apart.

Once you hit L5, that's a big score.  But links mitigate damage too.  Again, you just have to try it out to get a feel for it.

When you do take down a portal that has a lot of links, they'll be more likely to do it quickly.  Then they'll link up all their portals again and give you another opportunity to break it down again.  You should make portals in friendly territories strong, and portals in enemy-heavy areas weak.  Hey, you're doing them a favour too.  They get AP for rebuilding those links and fields.  This is one of the most valuable but counterintuitive things I've learned.

I've played from 1 to 8 as Resistance then faction changed and played back to level 7 as Enlightened.

Heavily outnumbered we try our best to send people to knock down level 7 and 8 farms whenever we see them. 

Previously I would have said that the change didn't effec that much but these two experiences changed my mind.

On Saturday I tried to knock down 5 tightly grouped level 7 portals. I found it both very hard and used all 3 of my lower level power cubes to do so. At one point I tried even to move away and ""peck"" at the ones on the outside but from a distance the damage mitigation was so high that it was just not a valid option without having way more inventory then I would normally have on me.

On Monday we found 5 8s in a new place and i went to try and take them down. I knew I didn't have the bursters to bust them but I had about 35 L7 XMP which normally would be enough to at least knock a few resonators off each one and let someone else come around for clean up.

I managed 2 and weakened 2 more then left with my tail between my legs and 8 XMP to my name.

1359355611.0,17f0nz,Some thoughts and impressions from my first week of playing Ingress.,thebornotaku,30,3,20,"First things first

Some thoughts:

1. MU. It's pointless. I know the whole ""point"" of the game is to get MU and make big fields but without any kind of incentive to make big fields or gather MU

2. Field size and link length. Also pointless. Again, and hacking for 1350AP for one big field, or find a nice portal-rich area, farm and hack away, make a bunch of little fields and rake in the AP.

3. There seems to be a pretty strong level imbalance. Playing as a L1 sucked. Playing as a L2 kinda sucks

4. And on that note, it's pointless. The game is more ""capture the portal and try to defend it"" rather than ""make fields and control the region"".

So

Though it's hard to make endgame play remain interesting

1. Scaling AP gain for field size/MU count. I don't know how the game figures out MU count but if it went by MU, either requiring more work on their part, or teamwork. And on that note...

2. Split AP between the players who made the field. Let's say you've got three players, and C. A links to B, B links to C, and C links back to A, in that order. When C links to A, it makes the control field and C gets all AP credit for the field. If there's boosted AP for big fields, it could easily turn in to a fight about who gets to make the final link. Easy solution is to split the AP three ways. One third of the AP gain for each link you make. All three links, and you only get 1/3 the AP, 10mins of each other

3. Improve Resonator placement so it coincides with reality. How? Make it so the resonator places where you are standing. There have been a few instances of portals in my town (and I'm sure, and it makes it unrealistic and really hard to attack.


I'm sure I had other thoughts and suggestions but this is what I can remember right now. Otherwise, it was pretty crazy to see our freshly claimed portal taking some big hits. We ran around the building to get some more XM and upgraded the portal really quick and luckily he had to do something else or whatever but later told us over the COMM that he was watching us run around outside while he was in the library.

Seeing all the pictures of (portal) buildings which happened to be illuminated in the correct faction color â wouldn't it be fun to *actually* install lighting at a suitable building which changes colors when the portal ownership changes?

I'm currently documenting their internal RPC API and getting the necessary information is easy using a library I wrote. We'd just need a spare invite code cause I'm not gonna risk my main account.

Their backend has LOTS of background checks, for example) results in an error.

**What is done:**

* backend which tracks the ownership of one or multiple portals

**What we'd need:**

* good locations (the hardest part I guess)
* ~~an invite code~~ (**done** â thank you /u/jswear !)
* a tutorial and a hardware draft

Imagine taking over a portal and an entire building changes color!

As soon as I've got an invite I'll set up the server (it's a simple HTTP API which is simple enough to be easily called from an Arduino). I won't publish the Ingress client library code

For the **hardware** part â a simple setup would consist of an Arduino and an [ethernet shield](http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoEthernetShield) which polls the API and drives an LED array or something bigger. Or a [Raspberry Pi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi)

**API examples** (not up yet

You have to get the GUID by looking at the JSON calls on the Intel site

Example query:

    http://query.ingressapi.net/portal?uid=96c410eac6af49658d5b27b5fe2449b.12

Result:

        {
             ""name"": ""Bound Brook World War I Memori""
             ""faction"": ""RESISTANCE""
             ""coords"": [...]
             ""level"": 5
             ""resonators"": 3

1353697119.0,13oenc,Ingress Strategy; My Take,Galanodel2012,36,11,18,"Hey there fellow ingress players. So I thought I would share some of the strategies I have learned working the battleground of Orlando. Note that this isn't a ""Tips and Tricks"" thread

1. Resource Starvation: So, and raise them to the highest level you can (3 is good when facing level 1 players), and shield them. Without level 1 portals to hack, these lower level players will quickly run out of resources, and a level 1 XMP does about 4% damage to a rare shielded level 3 resonator even if you are standing on top of it.

2. The Buffer Zone: When creating large fields, they'll target your lower level portals out of convenience, generating warning e-mails from Niantic Ops, and allowing you to prepare for their upcoming attacks on the higher level stuff. By utilizing this strategy, we were able to mount a successful defense of two cornerstone level 3 portals in our area last night.

3. Forward those Niantic emails: We have a separate e-mail created that we automatically forward all Niantic e-mail to

4. Idle with a full XM bar: This one is majorly important. Always return home with as full a bar as often as you can. You don't want to be caught empty of XM and suddenly have to recharge portals under attack

5. Level 4: This is your target level. You want to reach this as soon as possible. Level 4 is the highest level portal two people can make working as a team, as long as everything is shielded.

6. Links of all sizes have a purpose: So, most of our stuff in Orlando is linked together on a smaller scale , and then we will link further away stuff to the two previous linked ones, creating a control field that is smaller on one end, but huge on the other. This minimizes on travel time, and generates a decent number of MUs.

7. Destroying enemy resonators: The key to destroying enemy resonators can be broken down into a few easy to follow steps. Stand on top of a resonator, so that 2 or 3 final blasts will kill them almost simultaneously, keeping the enemy from reacting to the destruction emails quickly enough.

Hopefully this post was helpful. Feel free to correct me,,False,,t5_2vij9,False,,True

My nearest portal is 2km away (line of sight), and where I work.

The nearest towns/villages are about 30min travel time (highway speeds) from each other. So when I have the time I spend a few hours travelling to the next town, it's why I'm now L6 i guess.

It's very easy to run out of XMP during an attack and then I have to travel more than 200m to find another portal with XMP around it.

The effort I put in to visit and maintain portals is already fairly high (walking through fields, but with this new decay rate it's pretty well impossible to maintain the remote portals. 

Sure

How would I fix this? Not sure. Maybe introduce character classes like Engineer and Commando. Engineer can build better portals

We are able to build fairly large fields because of the lack of competition and the fact that everyone around here has to travel 30+ km to get to work

I'll start with some of my best:

* **Place all resonators directly on portal** - This is probably the one single every new player makes. I've been playing only 3 days

* **Play with GPS disabled** - I have to admit that this took me longer than it should have. I had already hacked several portals and captured some more when I encountered one portal (a bit more off from the city centre) that somehow was always shown out of reach, and placed me right on top of the portal.

* **Forget that keys disappear when creating links** - It was a perfect plan: Upgrade portal A, then travel to B, upgrade it, and link it to C to create the biggest field in the area. Okay, I had to leave soon, but the time would just be enough to accomplish everything. And everything worked fine... except for the last part of linking B to C - ""no linkable portals"". But at least I learned something: when you link to a portal, you lose its portal key. Plan accordingly!
* **Fire XMPs from wrong locations** - XMP bursters have a linear decrease in damage... if you want to target a single resonator
* **Drive 20km to a bunch of unclaimed portals only to find out there is no cell phone reception at that place** - similar: drive 10km to an unclaimed portal only to find that it's not accessible.
