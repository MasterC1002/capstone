I visit r/realmadrid occasionally, can be regarded as quite unpleasant by those subscribed to r/realmadrid. This is something that has been voiced by Madrid fans both in their subreddit and on r/soccer.

I don't know about you fellows but personally I suggest that we should avoid posting too much there. I think we should respect their subreddit. I see r/barca as a sanctuary for us fans away from the reactionary and sometimes childish environment that is r/soccer.

Livestream of press conference here. More details to come.

I take back every argument I made trying to possibly justify the practical reasons for Abidal's departure. Seeing this actually happen

Rosell and Zubizarreta have deflected all questions about their decision with ""It's a complicated process."" It's one thing to make a controversial decision

Abidal mentions how the club constantly delayed discussion of his contract for months. Bastards.

Abidal breaks into tears as the conference ends and he hugs all the members of the team and technical staff before leaving. Look of anguish on his face is haunting.

75' - Iniesta and Neymar with a lot of passes between each other within the Levante box.

76' - Tello on for Pedro (3/3).

78' - **yellow** Xumetra for pulling the shirt.

81' - Neymar with a great run and a pass back.

84' - Barca seems content with the score and does little more than holding the ball now with sporadic attacks.

86' - Cesc with a great ball to Neymar whose attempt is denied by Navas.

1. Barca have ceased to practice the style of play which enabled it to win 14 out of 19 titles in four years. Has it ceased to practice it entirely? No, as if it had ripped the pocket of its pants and was losing change with each step.

2. The so-called positional play does not consist of having the ball and accumulating a high percentage of possession, but it has to generate superiorities. Guardiola's Barca always sought to have the ball in order to attack the opponent by means of rapid ball movement, even if horizontally: they did it this way seeking to provoke disorder in the opposition and generate the resulting space from which it could advance further.

3. Possession was a simple instrument, Guardiola considered it only this: one more tool of the game. The same thing happened with Barca's famous pressure and ability to recover the ball (i.e. the 6-second rule).

4. When Eto'o was at Barca, that pressure was also just another simple instrument and thermometer.

5. Thermometer? Yes, without hurry, with long periods of possession, tiring and tiring the opponents, moving them around and making it difficult for them to maintain order. If you managed to follow these steps, you made it hard for them. If you lost the ball you had four teammates close by = recovering the ball. The recovery was the thermometer that indicated if you had attacked well.


6. These were some instruments (to explain all of them would be too extensive) of Pep's mode of play. When the Pep Team suffered its fall before Chelsea and Madrid last April

7. As a result, above all to the substitutes of the first team? (titulares?), but the problem did not reside in the defense (well, sometimes them too), but in the mode of play. Because in the transition towards verticality they fell into the fault of haste. With rather good judgement, an external expert dubbed them ""los acelerados."" The Barca that ""bored"" madridistas (but won 14/19 titles) began to seem more like the speedy Madrid, but with none of their resources.

8. Of course, more rapid, with shorter possessions, without attacking together nor closely together...The result was that it cost them a great deal more to recover the ball. How it wouldn't cost them if only the basic recovery were positional and not physical! Logically, with players spread out this way, the lines very separated this way, recovery could not turn out to be simple by the greater amount of running that it gave Busquets.

9. Today Barca runs more than before, the appropriate utilization of each instrument.

10. In this journey, the relaxation of certain habits (I am not suggesting anything grave) allowed us to see a Barca each day more powerful since November. But they also were forgetting certain details: fight for each throw-in, not take anything for granted, play directly to Messi instead of playing it through Xavi and letting him move the pieces and play for Messi, which is different...

11. We must touch upon this point. In the most orthodox Barca style, in the style of a mountain climber. And only when each piece - their own and their opponent's - was in an adequate position did the ball find its way to Messi. At this point, freedom for Messi (to do his thing).

12. The course, but with Xavi the intermediate carrier. But even when Guardiola was on the bench the team began to skip the Xavi step. Sometimes by haste, by wanting to run forward too much, sometimes even Xavi himself was not at his best (right now something similar is happening). For whatever reason, the rest area, the intermediary step, was disappearing, instead becoming the beginning and end of everything

13. Against medium opponents, preferring to keep the ball in order to not run risks, not keeping it to make the opposition run. Barca didn't attack Milan with the ball, rather trying to protect themselves with it. They came out of it poorly, and in that moment the little details became enormous in the mind of certain players who, after such success, were beginning to forget what it was to suffer on the field.

14. Against Sevilla they did not play better, with Pedro and Iniesta open on the wings and sharp. Ten minutes of good combinations and fluidity, but too quickly they returned to recent faults: play totally oriented through the middle and no horizontal switching whatsoever; Xavi retreated to join Busquets, with him disappeared the midfielders that should be generating numerical superiority behind the lines of Madrid; Iniesta had to come back in turn. Madrid had won the battle although the score did not yet say so.

15. What's happening to Barca? An accumulation of tactical mistakes, come together, recuperate by being close together, looking to the wings...their problem is in the football and now it affects their mind, that for the first time in years is processing uncertainty and incomprehension. It is not the legs nor the fitness: it is the play. Yes, with the addition that their coach is sick and against this there is neither criticism nor nuance: it is what it is and the club decided with good reason to hope that Tito heals, something much more important than any victory.

16. Crazy, after conceding a treacherous goal, the team grabbed the ball out of the net, placed it in the middle of the field, and the first pass was to Xavi, as if to say: ""Take it, organize us.""  Now, get us out of this mess."" And Pique, but it is a way to reflect the situation as it seems to me.

17. And the self-criticism. Nobody is so good as to be the best for eternity. Errors are not sins, define, and correct them. Someone as little reflective as Dani Alves said last night: ""We have had neither control nor long possessions."" That is to say, at least a footballer still nows what is the real problem: the play.",,False,,1367325667.0,t3_1ddgpr

The 19-man squad traveling to the Bernabeu: Valdes, Pique, Puyol, Masch, Bartra, Alba, Adriano, Song, Iniesta, Alexis

One will be dropped before the game, Tello, and Cuenca don't make the squad - no surprises there, really. Most importantly, Puyol will feature in his first Clasico this season! You can almost hear the merengues' knees knocking together at the mere thought of facing El Capita.

Real Madrid squad news: Ramos

So Madrid are undoubtedly weakened as far as squad goes, having only conceded 1 goal over 3 games against Valencia. Both teams will view this game as a huge opportunity. Barca want to take advantage of a struggling Madrid, get some away goals and build up a lead before Madrid's full squad returns for the second leg. Madrid have been terrible in comparison to Barca all season and will be eager to knock us down a few pegs.

Tactical notes: it's not clear whether Mou will sit back and defend for a 0-0, one thing is clear: we have to take the game to them. Too many Clasicos have now passed with us coming out flat and conceding a foolish early goal, then struggling back into the game. We have the best attack in the league, up against (most likely) Arbeloa, Varane, Carvalho, and a rusty Marcelo. Hit them hard and early

It'll be a tough game

Finally, and will of course post proof.

As far as our lineup goes, Xaviesquets in the middle, and Pique and Puyol in the center. The determining factor for me is whether we start Alves and Alba or give Montoya a run. Personally, I think we could use a bit more defense, but then again I'm not sure I'd match Montoya up against Ronaldo. Maybe Masch starts with Puyol on one side? I'm just fucking tired of conceding from the wings.

This will not be an easy game. Mentally, a bit dismayed and disorganized after the Milan game, but with the next leg two weeks away.

**INTRODUCTION**


Over the past years Barcelona has experienced a golden era in terms of football

This idea, to develop a distinct style of play, FC Barcelona has achieved on an institutional level. All thanks to the fact that its fans, employees, players, coaches, board of directors and presidents have wished it to be so.

Josep Guardiola’s appointment as manager of the first team should be seen as the tipping point for this model. His exit put a lot of pressure on the current board of directors to maintain this approach by finding a coach and players that would adapt to it. This responsibility is now delegated to the new coach, so that the fans can decide whether or not they agree that the club should follow this path into the future. 

In this historic moment Tito Vilanova takes the reins of a team and group of players who had given some indication that they had reached the end of their cycle. He takes over in at a very risky moment.  

The greatest risk is to fall into *decadence*

The risk of Barcelona becoming a parody of itself and losing sight of the true objective is very real. Vilanova has the responsibility of not breaking with the footballing philosophy and model has joined the majority of the fans to their team. He will be responsible to keep the fans excited and happy during each match. 

Our goal is to analyze this new project. In order to understand where the ideas come from

-------------------------

If in the end we lose it will hurt no matter what, just like Piqué.

Big questions going into the match are which one or two of  Xavi, Alexis, Villa, Tello). 

I think Iniesta has to be in the midfield this match and I'd like to see Pedro and Alexis on the wings.

____________

**Barcelona Squad**: Goalkeepers: Valdes

Defenders: Alves, Alba, Mascherano, Adriano

Midfielders: Busquets, Iniesta, Thiago, Cesc

Forwards: Messi, Pedro, Tello




**Milan Squad**: Goalkeepers: Abbiati

Defenders: Abate, De Sciglio, Mexes, Yepes, Zapata.

Midfielders: Ambrosini, Flamini, Montolivo, Muntari, Nocerino, Traoré.

Strikers: Bojan, Robinho.

Giampaolo Pazzini hasn't been called up as he has sustained a micro fracture in the calf bone of his right leg. He's expected to be sidelined for the next 10-14 days.

Stop acting like a crazy teenage girl and get out of Thiagos ass. He didn't want to play for us any longer!! His priority was himself not the club! 

Many of us come to this sub to read discussions about things that can help our club and other news regarding Barca! Quit spamming the sub with your whining. 

Thank You! 

Edit: I would like to apologize to everyone who got offended or angered by this post that was not my intent. everyone has their own opinion and they should all be equally respected. 

The reason I made this post was because of the amount of people continuously complaining about Thiago leaving. I think all of us find it upsetting that he left due to managements screw up and him wanting to leave

I wish Thiago all the success in Munich

Once again apologizes to those whom were angered by this post.

His surge in form at the last season showed me that adaptation period was over. I think in this friendly today Sanchez was easily the most impressive player (sergi was messi were amazing as well). 
He has always been excellent at setting up goals
No matter how good neymar is i am certain there is no way at least this season his build up and combination play will be as good with messi and the rest of the offense as Sanchez.

* Fixtures are mostly based on [the calendar on fcbarcelona.com](http://www.fcbarcelona.com/football/first-team/calendar).
* Until the official times and dates LFP games stay at saturday/sunday (tuesday/wednesday) all day long events with an '(unconfirmed hour)' note.
Taken from fcbarcelona.com:
""*The exact day of the match can not be considered definitive until the start time is shown. The day and hour will be decided approximately ten days before the match.*""
* The format for the calendar entries - Home matches: Atletico Madrid @ FC Barcelona ||

Good stuff!



-------------------------------------------------------


**David Villa: Surviving Barcelona**

He signed with Barça to face challenges worthy of his talents. His career had been a steady climb to the top: Sporting, a sustained arc of progression. It was May 2010. Naturally, Villa’s signing was seen as the Rubicon of his career. 

It was a big deal.

However, where would he play on Messi’s team, when the only forward for Pep was the Argentinean? He considered the spectre of Eto’o and Ibrahimovic, two forwards that had moved on with more disappointment than glory, as well as the situation of Bojan Krikic, who was still with the club but was clearly regressing month after month. It was written in the contract: Villa would play on the left, a position that he had already played with Spain, but playing for the Barcelona that won 6 trophies in a season was incentive enough. It was a personal sacrifice

The plan worked out well and Villa’s performance was satisfactory. *El Guaje* scored 28 goals his first season, two titles that he did not yet have. Pushed out to the left wing, asked to make runs and attack one on one from there, Villa tried to make the most of his ambidexterity, surviving in his new position, adapting with admirable aplomb despite the difficulty. Villa was an attacking *specialist* playing within a system that was increasingly dominated by versatile *combination* players who were all cut from the same mold, with Messi supplying the frenzied attack. How long could Villa shine on a team that was increasingly devoted to playing as many midfielders as possible? At the very least the risk was to be completely exposed

And then came the horrible injury in Japan, his role on the team and his supposed unhappiness. The injury ended the speculation, but his prolonged absence cast further doubt into his future, or at least led to uncertainty. When he returned Pep was gone, replaced by Tito, and his role on the team was unknown and even today it’s still not clear. He has gained playing time as his physical conditioning has improved, showing himself to be effective when he has had chances. It’s possible that in Tito’s more *chaotic* Barcelona, but at the moment his contributions are still mostly intermittent. What role will Vilanova give him when he is 100% in shape

The question of what his role will be in Barcelona is difficult to answer and his ambiguous time in Can Barça is proof of this.  It’s quite strange to see the situation of the highest goal scorer in la Selección  (53 goals) and the 13th highest in the history of La Liga

And it made sense. And it still does. 

His role in Tito’s Barça does not have to be the same as what it was under Pep (in either season), which everyone hopes to overcome. Although Villa will be unable to play as a 9, unless Messi uncharacteristically gets injured,  he can still give us wonderful matches  playing from the left or anywhere else, as he has already shown many times. The team is no longer progressing toward playing with 10 midfielders, but rather it is moving toward a hybrid with different registers, which makes things easier for the Asturian. Now that his first period at Barça is over, he now starts a new, the striker pushed out on the wing playing with his opposite leg, although sometimes surviving a top club can be the hardest test possible.

[Sport](http://www.sport.es/es/noticias/barca/semana-clave-para-cesc-2407087) gave out a recent article on Cesc wanting to have a sit down with Tito this week to know what his role in the team will be for next year. 

Thiago seems to be doing the same by letting his father [flirt with other clubs](http://www.mundodeportivo.com/20130531/fc-barcelona/conversaciones-thiago-alcantara-real-madrid_54375032583.html).

As it seems

I would personally prefer for both to stay and have no changes to the midfield other than sidelining Xavi to give way for the two aforementioned. However

I made this [**GIF**](http://i.imgur.com/VrP1hYn.gif) to give an example on how their different styles might conflict in the future.

This might be very controvercial

I am curious to hear how Barca was perceived before Cruyff...let's say in the 1980's. By then Barca had only won 10 Ligas (Madrid 24, we were very far from Real Madrid, and closer to Atletico Madrid and Bilbao. For example, I think that back then the most important Derby in Spain was not Barca-Madrid....but Atletico-Madrid!
Probably in the world Barca was just considered a 2nd tier team...such as Roma

* Messi dropped too deep, so maybe he was just trying to escape, but it hurts us and clutters the midfield. Too often Cesc was making the runs Messi should be - and Messi's the one we want burying those chances, despite Cesc's goal.

* I think we're seeing the limitations of the Cesc-Iniesta-Alba axis on the left. We did not use that flank enough today. Iniesta played amazingly, and thus didn't have the space to get forward enough. Moreover, they whipped in crosses from that left wing all day long, and that's what eventually led to the goal. Both offensively and defensively, e needed a real winger out there - to challenge Essien and make runs behind him, and to close down those crosses quicker on defense.

* Related: we simply didn't attack enough. Too often they had 6-7 people back in defense and we had only Pedro in attack. The team was static, Pedro, Alves and Alba showed any sort of off the ball movement - and our fullbacks couldn't get forward as much because of their threats on the counter.

* Our passing was sloppy in general - Xavi in particular had a terrible first half.

* The ref was shit on both sides.

* Our defense had an amazing game

* Varane is the bane of my existence. I honestly think we just saw the birth of Real Madrid's version of Puyol. He's going to cause us problems for many years.

* If Villa has no role for us in big games, why not sell him? It's ridiculous to keep him only for cup games or Osasuna when we could be giving minutes to youngsters like Tello and Cuenca. Disrespectful in my eyes.

Madrid put up a fantastic fight defensively, after leading the league in goals scored, is truly, truly disappointing. Oh well - we'll have to get them next time. Visca Barca. Nominate your **MOTM** below.

Now, but the damage seems to have been done already, and he [says he doesn't care anyway](http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/wu8kk/i_have_been_banned_from_rbarca_for_remembering_a/c5gqgty). I won't lie that I'm a bit disappointed that the first thing he did as soon as he was banned was go on over to /r/soccer claiming how he was banned for expressing his opinions as a true fan, opinions which ""the Americans who run this place won't understand"" (FYI only two of the mods are American, a few Spanish and other assorted varieties), and that he didn't message the mods inquiring why he was banned at all. 

The impression a lot of you seem to have been given is that this subreddit is a circle jerk, so that doesn't bother me too much; but I do hope that the posters who have been here a while will certainly realise that that's not true at all. Remember when Alves' celebrated against Rayo Vallecano by dancing, and half the people here were annoyed at him and the other half seemed to think they were being over sensitive pansies. Opinion has been divided about Cesc since he came, about Piqué's form and celebrity lifestyle etc. 

I also don't want people getting the impression that we ban people regularly, except this time of course. 

In any case, this subreddit is usually very quiet and our job usually just consists of approving posts that the spam filter snagged, updating the sidebar and header image.

TL;DR cliffs:

- the_phet should not have been banned for perceived trolling

- A mistake was made, and this was an isolated event (again, 4 bans total in ~ 2 years here).

On the one hand, and Madrid seem to be hitting form just in time. Moreover

On a more positive side, we have more forwards than we know what to do with, and Tito's midfield had their most dominant performance yet against Benfica, very reminiscent of Guardiola's Barca at their finest. We should be confident in our team, but not underestimate Madrid - with their backs up against the wall, they will fight for their lives, hitting our defense early and hard. I hope we've learned our lessons from the Supercopa. Expect the first 15 minutes of this game to be a scorcher.

Some of you started off because you were impressed with Barcelona's playing. Some of you because your family was supporting the club. Some because of a specific Player. 

Whatever your reasons are

I originally did not watch a lot of football. The only football I watched were World Cups as my father was a huge fan of Maradona and he used to support Argentina National Team. However, just to annoy him, I wagered my bets on Barcelona for the Champions League Final of Barcelona vs. Arsenal. So I went to watch the match and was simply spell bound by what I saw that night. Ever since that day, I became a Proud Cule.

1342425331.0,wmuwa,A summary of next year's B team,_sic,44,7,15,"I've been reading a bit about how next year's B team is shaping up

-------------------------

**Keepers:** Oier

* Bañuz is being promoted from juvenile because they need a 3rd keeper for when Oier is included in the first team for CL weeks. It should be mentioned that this will be the 5th season on the B team for both Oier and Masip

**Defense:** Balliu, Lombán, *Grimaldo* and Planas

* Supposedly the B team is about to sign a CB called Lé, which would kill that deal. If Justé doen’t come we will need to find another RB.  

* Lombán is a 25 year old vet of limited talent who was signed to bring in experience. Some would argue that such signings are useless (think Armando, because it cuts the progression of younger players, but I think that it's not a bad thing to have a few vets mixed in there. God knows that last season our defense lost a lot of leads due to stupid, inexperienced mistakes. 

* Ayala was promoted from juvenile and has a great future

* In general terms the defense looks goods because Balliu is a versatile player who can cover several positions. LB is well covered by Planas

* The player who has to step up the most is Sergi Gomez

**DM:** Gustavo

* B team is also negotiating to sign the Portuguese player

* According to some, so it remains to be seen how he will bounce back. Cá, the Portuguese player, supposedly has a profile similar to Edgar Davids and with some polish may be good enough to make the first team some day.

**Midfielders:** *Sergi Roberto*, Patric and *Espinosa* (Joan Angel Ramón can also play in the midfield).

* As always the strongest part of a Barça team, since he was a sub on the Juvenile (although it may have something to do with his promising brother Xavi Quintilla, who is a CB for the Juvenile).

* This year the most important thing is for Sergi Roberto to step up to the next level and Rafinha needs to continue to grow. I would also like to see Espinosa play a bit more

**Wingers:** Kiko, Miguel Angel, Joan Angel, *Tello*

* Joan Angel was just signed and could be a great addition. He played as a winger at Espanyol

* I heard that Miguel Angel had a great first half of the season with the juvenile team last season

* Although Tello still has a B team contract

* Lobato and Kiko were both disappointing signings and should probably both be sold. This would mean that a winger would have to be signed. It's possible that only one will be sold though.

* The most important thing is for possible future world beater Deulofeu to continue to grow. He still needs to do a lot of work on his decision making.

**Forwards:** *Dongou*

* Obviously, but it may be too late because he recently signed an extension with Valencia and Aduriz has been sent back to Athletic, so he may be their 2nd 9. 

* Also

**Summary**: 

* Rodri

* Players who are in negotiations: lé

* All in all a very young but extremely talented team whose success will probably hinge on signing the right forward once the dead weight is moved out. Expect an up and down season like last year.

* For me the most important goals of this team should be the progression of certain key players (in order) Sergi Roberto, Sergi Gomez, Grimaldo, Dongou and to maintain the team in Segunda.  Secondary goals are to give players like Ayala and Sergi Samper some playing time so that they can continue to grow.

**Edit**: As vganguly points out

**Edit 2**: According to Barcastuff ""Official: B-players Oier, Ilie, Lobato, Sergi Roberto, Kiko Femenia and Rafinha will start preseason with first team"". I imagine that for Lobato and Kiko it will be a way to put them on display before selling them.

**Edit 3**: Looks like the striker to be signed could be [Sergio Arujo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_Araujo)

Thiago 2 linked dimensions: 1) whether he's sold; 2) how much he's sold for. Even if he does want to go-selling him for 18M is awful value

That 18M release-something Rosell &amp; the board lied about when Thiago was renewed-is incompetent management. That's on the club

Then this idea that no one could be bothered to monitor how many matches Thiago played-not Tito

This narrative that this is entirely Thiago's choice is spin. Roselly &amp; the Board are spinning this issue to avoid being held accountable

Need to spin this issue is why there's been so many leaks about this in Catalan press. Barca wants to build that narrative-it's him not us

Just ask-why did the club lie about what Thiago's release clause truly was when he renewed? Creating this narrative-it's him-an extension

Seems to be major confusion about roles in midfield-orchestration focus v more ""attack focused."" Thiago's role-orchestration. Limited depth

Cesc

If Thiago leaves it's going to be on a very poor valuation &amp; will leave the team inadequately covered in midfield orchestration w Xavi aging

This is a far bigger issue than Thiago's decision alone. There's a context to that decision. And it's that context which is so troubling

The balance sheets of football clubs are comprised of the contracts of their players. Those are a club's assets. They have to be managed

For Barca to have completely mismanaged Thiago as an asset this way is pure incompetence. And Barca is now trying to spin it as his ""fault""

Someone at Barca needs to be held accountable for mismanaging Thiago's contract/situation. But that's point of this spin. ""It's not me""",,t5_2s561,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Barca/comments/1gl3m4/some_interesting_thoughts_form_euleri_on_the/

**The Panopticon of Sergio Busquets**

[Juanma Lillo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Manuel_Lillo) once said, by examining Busquets, you can trace the path that Barça has followed ever since Guardiola gave him a starting position on the first team.

Busi emerged in Guardiola’s squad, the *canterano* played a great deal, putting in quality minutes. In fact, injuries in the defense at the end of Guardiola’s first season gave him a starter’s role in the key moments of the season, including the Champion’s League Final. And Busquets never gave it up.

In that period, a footballer who started as a [4 and ended as a 6](http://www.notasdefutbol.com/historia/los-dorsales-y-su-leyenda), but even from a more advanced midfield position he continued to be the team’s compass. Therefore, Xavi needed a DM at his side that would give him the pivot when he dropped deep and allow him to mark the team’s rhythm, a partner in support and continuity. And so Busquets, who started as a 6 and ended as a 4, was the perfect man for the job. This explains why with barely a season in top flight football he would so clearly win the starting position from one the most dominant DMs in European football.

In both the 4-3-3 and the 4-2-4 that Pep used his second season, one of Guardiola’s last innovations was his CB-DM hybrid role.

Under Tito new horizons are opening up for the player. The early approach implemented by the new coach included wide open wingers and a double pivot. Busquets suffered in this scheme, this structure increased the distance between players and made it more difficult to create passing triangles. In this setup the support and continuity provided by Busquets had less importance  and when the team lost the ball he was farther away, making it difficult for him to press, one of his most valuable contributions to the team. Moreover, behind him the CBs were in a constant state of panic, compounding the problem.

However, Vilanova started working on his new concepts. Since then the double pivot has practically disappeared and Xavi is increasingly playing a more advanced position so that the team needs to alternate its helmsman. In Tito’s new system, which is closer to a **2-3-3-2** (see below), Busquets is frequently the player who plays the ball out from the pivot. If the team has difficulty playing the ball out from the back, the advanced midfielders drop back to lend support, but the basic plan is for them to be more advanced. But to make it easier for Sergio, Tito has created a “panopticon” structure which allows the DM to always find a passing lane. 

The panopticon model,s:0,i:87) as a way to increase surveillance and security, and which [Michel Focault popularized](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panopticism#Panopticism_in_Foucault.27s_Discipline_and_Punish) when he extrapolated it  as a way to understand how modern society functions, allows everything to be monitored from a central point. Surveillance from the center. 

This is how Vilanova uses Busquets, Cesc and Messi, who almost form a 3 man line. Iniesta, when he plays in the midfield replaces one of either Xavi or Cesc. Constantly creating passing lanes behind the defenders is very difficult to stop. Further up the pitch, in wide positions to start, the wingers wait. Passing long isn’t one of Busquets’ strongest qualities, but he has improved in this aspect the last few seasons.

To the right and left Busquets has an easy pass to the FBs who are positioned practically in parallel to his position. It’s an easy way to beat a press that closes down the three mediapuntas, behind him, he has the traditional support of the two CBs.

In Vilanova’s Barça, but even so he continues to be one of the key players on the squad match after match. Of course, Tito makes it easy for him.

So I went out looking for other 18-year-olds than Marquinhos

My vote at this point would be Agger and a cheap youngster. Euler seems convinced we should shell out money for Mangala

Doria: Brazilian, has done well for U-20 national team. Linked to Europe and Barca once or twice. What I saw on Youtube I didn't love, he seemed pretty big and slow, but others rate him very highly.

Ezequiel Munoz: 22, seems to read the game well and make good tackles. Was called up for Argentina by Maradona. Moreover, Palermo have been relegated this year, so he could actually be feasible: found a twitter source saying he's likely to leave this year. Here he is on whoscored http://www.whoscored.com/Players/70733, not bad statistics at all.

Other names I came across: Zouma, damnit).

So that's what I have to start. What we do as fans has absolutely no impact on Barca's eventual decisions, rather than getting hyped up over what Sport and MD tell me to do.

***“The new project is already underway. We already spoke about that in New York. There are some parts that are pretty advanced but we cannot say anything.***

*“There are positions we need to strengthen. That’s life as the years pass. It is something that our Coach is managing very well.”*

Vilanova missed two months of this term at the club to receive treatment in New York for cancer that had returned to one of his salivary glands.

However

***“Tito Vilanova will lead the club next year. For one thing we have a contract and we trust him.***

*“It was not easy to make the transition and he has done a great job.*

*“It has been a very difficult year for him personally and at a sporting level

***“We will make four or five signings this summer

Transfer speculation is that Neymar is on his way to the Camp Nou in the summer.

***“The signing of Neymar has not been done. He is a player of interest to us

***“He has a contract with Santos whilst we have not heard that he wants to leave Santos. If says he wants to leave

Bartomeu also reflected that the League remains the club’s top priority this campaign.

*“The League is the first target. It has been difficult but getting to this points difference is to be celebrated because it is not easy.*

*“It is confirmation that the project has a future perspective.”*

The Vice-President also made clear that the club must be optimistic ahead of next week’s second leg against Bayern.

*“It’s hard but we can cause an upset [in the return leg]. Everything is possible. Madrid believe in their comeback and we also have to believe.*

*“Our players are the same as always

I'd say we let some Barca B players play for FC Barcelona against Espanyol. If Girona manage to win the game

Pretty exciting and specially given as FC Barcelona already won the title and Barca B secured their spot in Segunda Division this would give us something to root for! I'd like to see a third Catalan team in La Liga!

Please, the piece by Zonal Marking that /u/doccoyote63 posted a few hours ago:
http://www.zonalmarking.net/2013/03/13/barcelona-4-0-milan-tactics/

Barca used a new formation (that I love):

      Pique    Masch     Alba

               Busi
         Xavi         Iniesta
              Messi
  
     Alves    Villa    Pedro

- Alba clearly received instructions to play an ""Abidal"" role, Guardiola used it in most of his games.

- The revolution was using Villa, Messi himself asked for this tactic:

&gt;Interestingly – as mentioned after Barca’s Copa Del Rey defeat against Real Madrid – in the match against Sevilla (immediately after Barcelona’s defeat in Milan) Messi commented on the positive impact of Villa playing upfront. “With Villa up front in the second half,” he said. Nothing mind-blowing, but it’s quite rare for Messi to comment upon his side’s tactics.

Messi himself asked for this formation. Amazing.

It gave us three improvements:

1) We still have width

2) Messi is free. This is thanks to Villa distracting the CBs. Villa scored this time

3) We have a decent defense


I'm sure we will see this formation in the future

Most football aficionados – be they fans, through YouTube highlights of catastrophic goals or errors, we are bombarded with information that makes us feel like experts. Some of us may recognize that our knowledge is incomplete


Myth 1: Neymar is inexperienced and untested. We’ve all said this in some form or other: Neymar is moving from Brazil straight to an elite European league, the Copa Libertadores, CONMEBOL’s version of the Champions League.

In 2011, scoring the winning goal in the 2-1 victory over Uruguayan club Peñarol in the final, being named “man of the match” in the process and voted player of the tournament. This was an enormous milestone in Santos’s history: the last time they won the Copa Libertadores was 1963, led by none other than Pelé himself. Pelé may be a horrible, narcissistic pundit, but in this particular vein Neymar’s comparisons to O Rei are grounded in an incredible achievement.

Myth 2: Neymar is selfish and lazy. Since 2011, Paulo Henrique Ganso. Previously Ganso had been able to feed Neymar excellent passes, allowing Neymar to thrive as a finisher on the left wing. With Ganso gone, the creative role fell increasingly on Neymar, who like Messi, often dropped back as far as half-field to pick up the ball. Now responsible for the creative burden as well as goalscoring, Neymar’s play in recent months occasionally appeared selfish as he embarked on long solo runs in the middle of the park

But Neymar has also responded to the challenge, Neymar works hard. Very hard. He wants the ball, and will pursue whoever has it until he gets it.” Work-rate is incredibly important in a Barça forward, but Neymar’s physical frailty belies an unflinching determination to win the ball back and help his team.

Anyone who watched the Olympic games in 2012 should have already taken a stance against accusations of laziness and selfishness.

Myth 3: Neymar is arrogant and immature. If you followed Neymar’s presentation on Monday here at totalBarça and listened to his press conference, Neymar proved himself adept at handling the press. Faced with questions clearly meant to draw out an ego for the tabloid headlines, Neymar reiterated his admiration for Xavi, Iniesta, and Messi, dismissed comparisons of himself to Ronaldinho, Ronaldo and past Brazilian greats, the Brazilian expressed humility and honesty about the year ahead: “I think it could be a difficult change for me

Myth 4: Neymar is an outrageous luxury purchase at €57m. Put down the pitchforks – I am by no means defending Rosell, but here I wish to simply add some nuance to the financial aspects of the deal. Fifty-seven million is a huge sum, especially when players of similar quality like Lucas, Hazard, and Götze have all moved for around 40m euros. But there are two mitigating factors. First, Neymar is one of the most marketable players on the planet. In his time at Santos, the club’s marketing revenue quadrupled, and the spending power of South America should not be underestimated. Neymar could earn back a large chunk of his transfer fee in the next year or two alone.

Second, according to Tom Conn from Inside La Liga and Andreas Vou from Mundo Deportivo. Spurred by Sandro Rosell, a former Nike executive in Brazil, the American sporting giant is believed to have part sponsored Ronaldinho’s landmark move to Barcelona back in 2003. According to these sources, now that Rosell is president of FC Barcelona, a similar scenario has occurred again, with Nike contributing anywhere from 11-19m euros in order to send Neymar to Catalonia. Faced with late, and with other Nike icon Cristiano Ronaldo locked up at Madrid for the foreseeable future, but it is silly to imagine the sum of 57m as simply a giant pile of cash handed over in a briefcase. Neymar may prove to be any number of things at Barcelona

In many ways, who moved from Brazil to top clubs as relatively unknown players, Neymar’s reputation has preceded his arrival in Europe by several years, developing into polarizing myths of either “future legend” or “flop.” Now that he has at last arrived in Barcelona, we owe it to ourselves to try to get to know the player, not the phenomenon.

1366843745.0,1d1jn4,Yet another summer transfer thread (over 15 players analyzed),astral_cowboy,33,3,102,"Brace youselvers

**BUY**

* Winger

1. Neymar da Silva Santos Júnior ""Neymar"" (Santos FC): A no-brainer. We need someone to help Messi upfront relieve him of all the pressure from the opponents. Neymar's a versatile winger, but he might bring back the old magic Ronaldinho used to have and give us many, many smiles. Since signing him is very likely to happen, I won't analyze that many options for wingers, except for two exceptional ones. (40M)
2. Sergio Agüero (Manchester City) - If for some reason we can't get Neymar, and that tag isn't likely to go down *if* Manchester wants to sell. Since he's one of their most important players, pushing for Agüero seems rather unlikely. (60M)
3. Gareth Bale (Tottenham Hotspur) - One of the most dangerous wingers around, and talent. His style may be too direct for our style of play, although that might also be for good. Just like Kun, his biggest drawback could be his price tag and the recluctance from Tottenham to sell him (if they don't give any preference to Real Madrid because of their recent collaboration deal). Bottom line: Signing Bale is highly unlikely.

* Center-back 

1. Marcos Aoás Corrêa ""Marquinhos"" (AS Roma) - He's young, and become another Henrique or Chygrynskiy (poor him, we should've kept him). If we were to buy him, he should slowly start playing. Keep in mind that, being that young, he *will* make mistakes, some of them might cost us games. But if polished the right way
2. Mats Hummels (Borussia Dortmund) - At 24, he should be played instead of Puyol. Although I haven't seen him play that much, one of the disadvantage lots of people mention is his speed and that he wouldn't add anything substantially different to what we already have with Piqué and possibly Bartra. Also, his price tag will likely be very high and if Lewandowski leaves (as rumors indicate), it will be hard for BVB to let go yet another player (Gotze).
3. Héctor Moreno (RCD Espanyol) - This lad has played well this season with Espanyol. He's a solid defender and has great long-passing skills -- something we seem to have lost since Rafa Márquez left. He's tall, at 26, he might be a good investment for a few years.
4. Vicent Kompany (Manchester City) - At 27

* Striker

1. Robert Lewandowski (Borussia Dortmund) - I swear I started to write these before their game against Real Madrid. He's a top-notch finisher that has scored 30+ in both, rumors are placing him in Bayern Munich. If these rumors aren't true, we definitely have a chance at getting him. A pure striker such as himself can open up many possibilities Villa should've opened up but never quite accomplished (due to tactics, etc).
2. Edin Dzeko (Manchester City) - A very effective striker and along with Agüero, but most likely won't be a safe bet for the long-term.
3. Mario Gomez (Bayern Munich) - He's set to leave at the end of this season and is definitely one of the best poachers around. Unfortunately
4. Javier Hernández (Manchester United) - Just as Mario Gomez, he might struggle against big and tall defenders. He certainly has a touch for goal, but sometimes that might not be enough. Rumors place him outside of Old Trafford this summer, and although Fergie has discarded that option, you can never know.
5. Fernando Torres (Chelsea FC) - Expensive and most likely won't happen.
6. Lucas Podolski (Arsenal FC) - Most likely won't happen.
7. Luis Suárez (Liverpool FC) - A big No-No. At some point he was linked with Barça (thanks in part to his agent being Pere Guardiola
8. Radamel Falcao (Atlético de Madrid) - Expensive and most likely won't happen.
9. Wilfried Bony (Vitesse) - He's the current top goal-scorer for the 2012-2013 season of the Eredivisie. I've seen him play a few times and he seems to be quite fast and lethal. Having almost no media coverage

* On buying a goalkeeper...

This baffles me a little. There are some possible scenarios:

1. Sell Valdés. The club can sell Valdés and buy a promising goalkeeper. There aren't many available GK around, and making too many changes at once might be detrimental to the team. 
2. Keep Valdés. At this moment, we can certainly take the loss, hold him this next season, and buy a keeper the next one. I think we should cut our losses and opt for the one that affects us the least. Are we fine with Valdés? Yes. Do we need to sell him because he's not playing well? No. Financially it doesn't make a lot of sense. But football-wise it might.
3. Sell Pinto and promote Oier. Pinto's getting old. He'll turn 38 next season and that might leave us in a weaker position in Copa del Rey. We don't have the option to not renew his contract, either Oier Olazábal or buy yet another one (depends on the Valdés outcome). If we do sell him, we will give him minutes from Copa del Rey and we could have him and a GK we sign competing for playing.

.


**SELL**

* Ibrahim Affelay (Schalke 04) - No surprises here. He doesn't add anything different to what we already have. He's been injury-prone
* Bojan Krkic (AC Milan) - Same as Affelay. During his time at AS Roma and AC Milan
* Jonathan dos Santos - He's had very few oppourtinities during this season
* Alexis Sánchez - He's been given plenty of opportunities without really delivering. He isn't the goal-scoring machine he was at Udinese (granted, he doesn't seem to be able to make an impact on big games. He's labeled as a hard-worker, which he is, but that's not enough to play at Barça (we also have other hard workers such as Pedro and Tello). If sold, the club might get a descent amount of money for him. (15M)
* David Villa - It will be hard to see him leave since he's one of my favorite players. However, so it's sell and make some money, re-new him, or let him go free next year. The club could potentially trade him to Dortmund for Lewandowski (doesn't sound like a far-fetched idea). Wenger might also be interested in him, with his recent Spanish crush. (20M)
* Javier Mascherano - A big surprise here. He's an A-class player, but unfortunately, he's too short and lightweight compared to Song. I definitely see our team in need of Song rather than him because he can add some muscle in times of need. Most likely he won't be sold, but if he is, he can bring in some serious money (I'm sure many teams from Serie A could be interested) (25M)

I'd personally would like to see some experiments done once in a while.

This is the most interesting setup I can imagine:

**Iniesta - Villa - Messi**

**Cesc - Xavi**

**Busquets**

**Alba - Puyol - Pique - Alves**

Iniesta, who will play a classic center forward role. This might leave our defense at risk a little bit and would not be very effective against the style employed by Celtic and Chelsea. If Malaga does play a deep and compact defense, we'll have to move Messi into the middle and bring on Pedro.

Anyone know if Tito is back?

1356124328.0,158wp2,I translated to English this in-depth tactical analysis of the infamous 5-0 against Real Madrid,jorge22s,30,2,9," 

I didn't wrote this myself
--

The football world hold their breath as the 2 giants of the sport were about to clash. No one could have predicted the outcome at Nou Camp. We saw the full power of this Barça, Pep Guardiola, had perfect reading of the rival. We analyzed 'El Clásico' from the winners perspective, a Barça team that put Madrid's project to shame. Before that, a few thoughts on Real Madrid. This Mourinho's team still has a long way to become the much glorified team the press makes out to be. There will be lots of opinions surrounding this game, it will be a lot of talk about Marcelo's bad performance (He was transcendent, althought not the worst). The reasons of yesterdays failure are lots of tactics and little to do with attitude. ""The Special One"" still doesn't have the competitive team Madrid's press claim. This Madrid has cracks and this shows when the pressure elevates.

The result was a consecuence of the great understanding Guardiola had of Madrid's issues and because of the style of a legendary team. Once I said this

**1 - Many people expecto to see Marcelo fall

The weakness on the left-back (Marcelo) had been said before the match, they were always 2 against 1. Even after the 2-0 and after Mourinho's tactical changes, Ramos kept being the target.

Let's start discussing Barça's defensive attitude and their positioning at the time of starting to touch the ball. We saw a Barça high-pressing, or even better Barça steal the ball on Madrid's side by high pressing.

Barça's circulation of the ball start from the defense, less important on the finishing touches than on other matches, but key on starting the plays from midfield, and even scoring a goal. His would be the 1st goal. The 2nd important tactical thing defensively speaking is stoping Cristiano Ronaldo's counter-attack, for that the left-or-right back that is playing on Ronaldo's attacking place stays defending and Pique plays on the opposite side of CR7 to stop Di Maria's run. Pique acts a false right-or-left back instead of a central defender. Pique plays slightly ahead of Puyol to touch more the ball and give passes to the midfielders, and Puyol helps in the back to stop and watch CR7. Avoiding losing the ball on their own midfield, secure tiki-taka circulation of the ball on midfield and not giving CR7 any chances are the key defensive tactics Pep prepared for El Clasico.

FOTO 1 http://i.imgur.com/qugxf.jpg

For this Barça doesn't play with a pure Center Forward, so the Iniesta+Villa association is the key of the game. Barça plays with more intensity on Ramos side, who always finds himself playing against 2 players: Iniesta in the interior and Villa as a Left Wing.

FOTO 2 http://i.imgur.com/3x7Xf.jpg

Messi never acted as a forward, and to outnumber Madrid's midfield. Iniesta's mission was to help Villa to beat Ramos and Xavi's was to organize, and even to try get to the box to shoot. Lionel Messi was constantly moving between Madrid's lines, mostly ahead of their Defensive Midfielders. His sole presence intimidates and attracts attention. The space behind Khedira is where Iniesta plays and helps Villa. Pedro shows up in the box to drag Pepe, hence allowing Iniesta to receive the passes.

FOTO 3 http://i.imgur.com/v4wJy.jpg

If Iniesta changes position

FOTO 4  http://i.imgur.com/cX1Py.jpg

The 1st goal is born out of this. Messi organizes

FOTO 5 http://i.imgur.com/L6xZJ.jpg
FOTO 6 http://i.imgur.com/z13mb.jpg

The 2nd goal comes the same way. Iniesta+Villa &gt; Ramos. Villa plays a Left Wing, plus Marcelos defensive issues cost 2 goals to Madrid. Barcelona knows how to win this game: attacks Ramos side and finish on Marcelo's.

FOTO 7 http://i.imgur.com/pSRCx.jpg

Mourinho tries to react against the whole that is the lack of help on Ramos side. He switches his wings

FOTO 8 http://i.imgur.com/PEe7B.jpg
 
This doesn't present an issue on Guardiola's election on wich side to attack. Even Mou takes Di Maria's help off Marcelo. Pep sticks to the script. His obsession is to blast Madrid's right side. Iniesta+Villa never get out of character

FOTO 9 http://i.imgur.com/XXl9m.jpg

**2 - Cristiano Ronaldo's journey

Having resolved Barça's attacking ways, then he crosses to Di Maria. On such a high-level match, these situations can lead to have a score sheet that doesn't truly represents what happens on the pitch. After this, Barça corrects this problem.

FOTO 10 http://i.imgur.com/licL0.jpg

This never happens again, he starts diagonal run without a ball taking advantage of the misplacement of Pique and Alves.

FOTO 11 http://i.imgur.com/yR4Aw.jpg

From there CR7 passes to Benzema and Abidal saves in-extremis. This was Madrid's best chance

FOTO 12 http://i.imgur.com/fwFIF.jpg

**3 - Messi+Villa the 2nd half deadly connection.**

Overwhelmed by the 1st half

FOTO 13 http://i.imgur.com/SsNYT.jpg

The game because homogenous, as a true 10, organizing, assisting, conducting. He intimidates and makes the 3 Madrid midfielders to constantly watch for him and close his passing lines. Villa acts as a Center Forward, slightly to the left. He looks out for the space between Ramos and Pepe, and kills them from there with speed and right timing.

FOTO 14 http://i.imgur.com/rRQMZ.jpg

The third goal appears like this, and again who is the absolute victim today: Ramos.

FOTO 15 http://i.imgur.com/zJ5ze.jpg

To finish punishing Ramos, wins Ramos back. If Barça doesn't have the ball, Villa keeps intimidating Ramos as a Left Wing, that leaves Pepe a little helpless.

FOTO 16 http://i.imgur.com/WhtH5.jpg

From there, avoids losing the ball maybe humilliate more Madrid with tiki-taka style who can't get back the ball. Pep's boys make the game a ballet performance and is only when Jeffren and Bojan get in that Barça goes on attack again. These 2 boys want more and the 5th goals arrives to an extasis explosion on Camp Now.

*Conclusion*

The humilliation is monumental. The distance between these 2 is supernatural. Madrid opens up a very dangerous door, those who can win the Champions League. Coaches around Europe now have arguments against Mourinho's side. A defeat this size has more consequences long-term.

On the contrary

Not sure how I feel about Puyol in the squad. On the one hand, if he gets injured I'll punch a baby. I'm really glad Tito brought a B-team CB though. And we've got a string of tough matches coming up for which I'd really like him to be healthy.

For context, our lineup was: Pinto, Maxwell, Bartra, Fontas, Montoya, Thiago, Sergi Roberto

Not sure which lineup I'd like to see. Personally, he will. Assuming that he does:

              Pinto
    Montoya Gomez Puyol Planas
               JDS
          Thiago Roberto
      Rafinha Messi Villa

Reasoning: Song will get game time elsewhere, like it was last season. Up front, I think it's overkill to start both Messi and Villa, but I think Villa needs to play and Messi seems to want to.

42' - Bartra in

45+1' - Tello with maybe the [best chance](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xzt61u_tello_sport)

**HALFTIME**  - A really boring 0-0 at half-time.

49' - A cross from Tello is easy pickings for Courtois.

51' - **[GOAL! Falcao](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xzt6jr_atc-1-0-fcb_sport)** gets to the ball after Barca's defence can't get it away.

54' - A Messi free-kick goes into the wall.

1361219065.0,18rr03,"Thoughts on Neymar, flair, and immaturity (an old topic, but just thought I'd share recent thoughts anyway)",egcg119,13, by a youtuber named rom7ooo:

One was a [Messi vs. Ronaldo video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUMFxK3D2I8) that was quite well done

The other was a [Neymar video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEJGJkOT9nU).

In the Neymar video, and did some moronic footwork or a rainbow. This is the mark of an immature player to me, and it reminds me a lot of Ronaldo at United. Everyone used to make fun of him for just doing endless stepovers and then falling on his face. But I know that the second Neymar moves to Barca, this shit would stop, because if he tried even one rainbow, Tito would bench him and Puyol would slap him silly.

So without the immaturity of those tricks, he has gained muscle, discipline, and consistency - but he has retained an extremely creative flair, as seen in the video above. Backheels, quick stepovers or chops, and juggling over a player are *extremely useful* when used appropriately. It's an element of surprise that, can leave a defender in the dust. We saw it with Ronaldinho, but because it's effective and the defender simply doesn't expect it. Flair can be used to showboat

Neymar, and that makes him dangerous. I'm not sure the same can be said of our current wingers. They are impossible to predict off the ball, and they are immensely hard-working and efficient on the ball, but they rarely take on defenders or catch them off guard. Ronaldo does. Ronaldinho always did. And I think Neymar can. More importantly, the maturing process we've seen with Ronaldo, from an obnoxious asshole kid doing tricks on the wing, to a powerful, creative forward

For the first time that I can remember both teams are coming into the clásico after losses. This is also one of the most crucial clásicos in recent memory, but it would definitely be a psychological advantage for Barça going into the final matches. 

One can imagine Mourinho longingly watching Chelsea's display of, as it is precisely what he wants to do when he plays against Barça. But, of course, he doesn't have the team to play that way; what he has is a team that is 100x better than Chelsea. It has been reported quite a bit in Spain that there has been a season long power struggle between Mourinho and the clique of players closest to him (CR7, Di Maria, Pepe, Coentrao, with the majority of the team just wanting to play good football against big teams instead of closing up shop like Mourinho has them do against Barcelona and complaining about referees when it doesn't work out. I don't know how true this is

Bad news: Alexis is doubtful for Saturday's match. Apparently he was visibly limping when he came off the plane today. 


So what lineups do you want to see?

1309178548.0,iaa6t,Why I'm 100% behind buying Sanchez and Cesc,_sic,32,3,39,"I've been doing some reading on the DiarioYoya forums recently that has convinced me that these two signings would be the best thing our team could do to keep progressing. Let me try to explain the major points.

**The situation.** Mascherano recently had an interview where he said that almost all teams start on the wings and move to the center, Xabi and Khedira and Alves marked by Di Maria. This man marking left space on either wing that Barcelona was unable to exploit because our wing players, while great, are no good at one on one situations, Villa in particular could not get around Arbeloa or Ramos. Pedro had slightly better luck against Marcelo, but mostly because of Alves wreaking havoc, a luxury that Villa doesn’t have on the left. In fact

*One thing we all know about Pep is that he’s never satisfied and he always trying to stay ahead of what other teams throw at Barça.* If we look back we can see after each of his seasons at the helm he’s tried to change up tactics and bring in new players to execute those tactics:

**Year 1.** The big problem was teams pressing high up the pitch against us. Guardiola thought that with a target man at the 9 we would be able to mix up our game with good outlets and secondary play.  So he went out and bought Ibra. In some respects this worked out well as one thing that people overlooked with Ibra was how well he would come down to the midfield and receive long outlet balls from Valdes when the other teams were committing 5-6 players pressing up high. He would often bring down the ball with two players hanging on him with insulting ease. He would then give nice passes to streaking players like Pedro or even Bojan. We destroyed teams like Tenerife that were pressing up high, he slowed the team down with his lack of movement up top which robbed the team of depth. 

**Year 2:** to counteract the lack of mobility and loss of depth caused by Ibra’s more static game, and to be honest for such a little guy he is amazingly effective at receiving long outlets to counteract pressing teams even when marked by much bigger players in the midfield.  So problem solved, but this has given rise to new problems on another level, the tactic of midfield flooding that I mentioned up top.

**Year 3.** With teams intent on flooding the midfield, making it harder for them to score, but providing just enough distraction to pull defenders out and give more space to the midfield artists).  Madrid will increasingly use this tactic, as most of the new signings are not superstars, but rather players who will be willing to sacrifice themselves executing Mourinho's negative tactics of man marking and roughing up Barça's midfielders.

**So what’s the solution?** *Clearly Alexis Sanchez*, pre-Guardiola: unstoppable on the wings, bold, strong, tough to bring down and with such good technique that it outshines even his startling physical attributes. Can you imagine bringing an insane dribbler like Alexis on for Villa or Pedro if a team is giving us the wings? It would be like throwing a hand grenade into the center of the pitch, the way the bunched up defenders will be scrambling to cover his runs from the wing. I'm pretty sure that Arbeloa, Ramos and Marcelo would pay money from their own pocket to ensure that Sanchez ends up in England instead of Camp Nou.

*I would also argue that Cesc enters into this equation* because Pep might want to expand on what we did in Anoeta this season when Xavi played the 4 for a stretch of the match. This might be an option along with Cesc and Iniesta that allows the team to keep the ball in the midfield for 80-90% possession to close out matches or against teams that are only interested in defending. It’s true that Cesc is not as brilliant at distribution as Xavi or at mazy runs like Iniesta but he’s still very good at both. Cesc is a polyvalent midfielder that gives a little bit of everything

**tl;dr Alexis gives Pep a new tactical variant and Cesc allows him to take his main approach to a new level.**

Xavi out for 10-15 days, which is rather strange. Still no sign of Abidal. 99.9% probability Bartra is the extra man dropped out for the game.

If Adriano's fit, but I'm certain he'll start.

My hopeful lineup:

    Alves Pique Puyol Adriano
             Busquets
           Cesc Iniesta
        Alexis Messi Villa

Also, but they're playing at home and can't simply play B-teamers. So it'll be interesting to see what balance Mourinho strikes. The only annoying thing is that as far as post-match bragging goes, we're kinda in a lose-lose: if they lose, they'll say ""oh, we rested players,"" and if we win, they'll laugh and say we can't beat their subs. Still, and hopefully for putting them back in their place before the United clash.
