So a couple days ago he came by with his repairman to install it and happened to notice my little 3-pipe rack on the coffee table. It's been there every time he has been over here but I guess this is the first time he's noticed. Now I work nights so I was asleep when he was over so my roommate was handling everything. The landlord mentioned the pipe-rack and explained that it was a non-smoking building. My roommate explained that I like to enjoy a nice pipe after work or in the morning with some coffee (ultimate yum) but he would let me know about the rules etc.

He left a letter when he was finished for each unit detailing that it was a ""non-smoking"" building and would not even permit it on the balconies as fires have been caused some places by smokers extinguishing butts into plant pots and stuff. All smoking must be done outside and away from the building. I was already prepared to essentially forego my enjoyment of a nice after-work or morning-pipe-with-coffee (with much sadness) as I just could not picture myself scuttling outside to huddle and puff in the driveway.

I have two kiddos

recently my parents came over to babysit so that my wife and I could go on a date. We went to a nice restaurant and went bowling afterwards. (real classy) We were trying to stay out past my kids' bedtimes so that when we got home we wouldn't interrupt their going to bed.

well we killed all the time we could and still ended up coming home too early.  so what do?  we decided to hang out in the back yard for a bit and just enjoy each other's company.  I pulled out my Pipe and tobacco

She proceeded to blow through it.

As of now I'm still on the fence about transitioning to the new company; it'll be a little ways down the road if I do decide to do so.

The long and short of this post, legitimately, several dozen / hundred unsmoked Savinelli pipes. Many of them were kept as backup stock for burnouts and defective units returning from stores and customers. I have a dozen pipes of my own so I really don't need this lifetime-supply stockpile.

Instead of putting them in small lots on eBay I thought I'd offer them to my redditor friends. Most of what I have would have retailed for $75 to $200; I was planning on offering you guys the higher end stuff initially and was thinking of asking for ~$30 per pipe. This seemed fair to me

Of course I also don't want to spam this subreddit trying to liquidate all this stuff, so tell me what you guys think.

Alright guys and gals, and decide on it yourself?

**My personal experience/background:** A few months ago, vote for it; don't want it? Down vote"". It was at this time that I connected my personal view points to my view points as a mod. Man can govern himself. I only ever wanted to be here to get rid of hateful/hurtful speech. As an active user I could do man other things to change or alter the content on the sub, but I never wanted to use mod power to do so.

Now I hear that people want things removed. X group believes that Y's posts are shallow. Y group believes that W's posts are annoying. Z thinks that none of them are deep enough in discussion

**Proposition:**  Have some tolerance for posts that you don't agree with. If you truly don't believe they shouldn't be here than down vote them. After down voting, click ""hide"" and be done with it. This is anyone's sub, this is all of our's. As much yours as mine. I'll give you an example, someone posts a meme, I recommend it for another sub. I don't remove it. I can, and I may wish to, but it has every right to be there as any of my posts do. I am sad that we have gotten to a point where we are removing posts. I am sad that we have reached a point where we have rules about what can and can't be posted. 

This isn't about /r/pipehogs, tobacco reviews/discussions, this is about being a community. Everyone here is awesome as fuck and there is no need for a turf war. As every B/SotL knows, sharing is caring, and for the most part, we have very few problems.

Sometimes its the nicotine


Its the grain of the briar. The coloring of the meerschaum. The simplicity of a corn cob.


Its the curated collection. The jars, each one unique, each one a friend.


Its beauty found in imperfection, a blackened rim.


Its slowing down. Sharing stories with friends. Having a quiet moment to yourself.


Its the strike of a match. The spark of the lighter. The spark of promise


Its a fleeting moment


Its tamping charred tobacco


Its restraint. Setting the pipe down when it gets too hot


Its drawing, dancing, then disappearing on a still night.


Its repetition. Familiarity. Routine.


So why do I smoke a pipe?


Sometimes its the nicotine

The last day of vacation - a Friday - I woke up with a sore throat. I returned to work on Saturday, my throat felt great and I was back to normal. 

Five days after my clinic visit, still no pain, but my throat looked just a gruesome - there is a large white patch in the back of my mouth. I gave it two weeks and I called my doctor to get it checked out; my fear was that it was [leukoplakia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukoplakia). 

For nearly two weeks, giving up my precious pipe collection, etc. And after two weeks, I had finally figured out to whom each of my pipes would go to, who all would receive parts of my cellar, and was generally at peace with the situation (if it isn't apparent yet, I can be a bit of a worrier; thanks for passing that trait down

I've been away because I was worried, so I simply prepared for the worst while hoping for the best. And the best worked out - the doctor says it is agitated scar tissue from my old tonsillectomy. Apparently allergies are causing it to become itchy and irritated, and has probably happened for most of my life, I just haven't noticed the patch at the back of my mouth before. I have been told that I have nothing to worry about. 

So, for us, a calculated risk we willingly take on. Do not forget to take care of your oral health, check yourself in the mirror monthly, tell your doctor and your dentist that you are a pipe smoker, whether you smoke daily or annually. Paying attention now will allow us to enjoy ourselves in this fantastic hobby for a long time to come. 

Thank you for listening to my ramble

I light the candle as I am sitting down to smoke.  By the time I have filled the bowl, being unrefined, it is just slightly tinged with honey.  The pecan is a very clean-burning wood, especially being fully dried, with no resin aftertaste.

**Just a warning

*I was born a poor black child…*

So as many of you may know I am from Boston MA. I lived outside of town for most of my life until I turned 22

So I told them I smoked a pipe, how should I put this, a huge cockbag.  I didn’t realize it at first but the little things started to pile up. Yeah he was a spoiled brat with no job and his parents paid for everything. He got kicked out of college for dealing drugs.  And in the apartment he would throw away other peoples food to store 50 pound of ground beef he bought, just for himself, Once walked in to him masturbating naked in the living room on the couch I brought for the apartment, sneaking into my room and going through my stuff, even after I changed my bedroom lock he called a locksmith to open it.  He would use chewing tobacco and leave open cups and bowls full of his spit on the floor, which was of course everyone else’s fault

Now all these things were really getting on my nerves, THAT was ok in the house but my pipe was not, which I found to be a bit strange and rude.  He didn’t have a glass pipe or a bong or even roll joints, he’d make  “pipes” out of apples or tin foil or soda cans etc. All of which he would leave around the house.  So after about 3 months I realized we were all living in “Adams Apartment.”

So, I loved this pipe. It was my first pipe that was really worth the money I paid. Up until then I owned a drug store pipe and a cob.  I kept my room locked and I kept my Qandale in its original box on a shelf in my closet.  So you can imagine my surprise to come home and Adam is sitting on the cum couch, porn up on his laptop, and he’s smoking pot out of my Qandale. A whole bowl worth. I stood shocked and asked him what the hell he was doing.  He told me that I said it was ok and that I’m an asshole because he doesn’t have a job to afford a nice pipe and I do so I should share mine with him. We started to yell and insult each other, and then when I asked how he got into my room, he admitted to calling the landlord and having him get a lock smith. I knew at that point it was time to start looking for another apartment.  So I told him to clean it out and leave it on my desk in my room and I expected it clean when I got back that night. He put up a stink about it and I literally offered to buy him a pipe for him to smoke out of to shut him up.  His exact words: “No, I like yours too much. I’m spoiled now.”  I had to leave. I left for the day and spent it with my friends just stressing about my roommate and all the other little things.  I texted him to remind him to clean it out (I told him to use alcohol) and to leave it on my desk.  Get home maybe 9pm, porn still up on laptop, on the floor

The stem was snapped in half, maybe you should watch where you’re walking.”  It took every ounce of strength I had not to hit this guy. I packed up anything I could and started moving home.  Never got him to replace the pipe, never got an apology, and in the end I didn’t care as long as I was done with him.


But I was not done.   Some of you may remember I said that his GF was upstairs crying.  Well if you didn’t like him before or felt kinda *meh* about him
**He Beat Up His Girlfriend**

This is a thing I cannot abide. Nope, other roommate Richie.)  So I told them I would be out at end of the month but really I was only ever there to pick up stuff and bring it back to my parents.  


So I go there for the last time to get just a few more things. Walk in the living room watching him smack her across the face.  I have never in my life hit someone as hard as I hit him. I pick him up and put him on the couch.  He starts kicking me off and lunging at me until a full fledge fight breaks out. I keep trying to hold him down to calm him down and stop it but he somehow keeps coming.  I’m not a violent person. I’m a big guy and I’m strong. I’m a 6’1 250lbs boxer/rugby player. I’m also a big teddy bear and can usually diffuse and situation with a joke. So to put me at this level of anger had never really happened before.   Cops get called


Adam however was on the couch screaming his head off half crying and half yelling at the cops about how I had “ruined his life.” Cops were cool

I eventually replaced the Qandale on my own. I should have really pressed charges at least to replace that. But I would have much rather have been done with it.  

**HAPPY ENDING EDIT: So after the whole fiasco, who wanted to buy it for $250, Richie sold it to me. For one dollar and a coffee. Now it's in my living room. I also got a newer better car thanks to the insurance. And I was ok.**

**Scooby Doo Ending:  I can't believe I forgot this part.  So about a year later, in the lobby of my office. He left the second he saw me.**

She fit into a piece of my soul, that she wanted. She would not take no for an answer

We got her from a give away litter, all the way home. She chirped and talked to me, and many was the night Marsha would hear Prissy and I having a conversation; with Prissy chirping and answering back as we walked down the hallway. She was a beautiful and soft green and fuzzy brown undercoated, Manx. A bonafide and genuine Rumpy.

She passed in my arms this morning at 9am EST. I should have known. She spent the last two or three days real close to me, because I didn't want to face the terrible truth. She made her peace with me and gave me the last friendship she had in her body.

I will miss you my friend. Prissy took a piece of my heart today with her.

**Opening Thoughts:** None of the information in here is especially original or ground breaking. Most of it is common knowledge to pipe smokers

**BEGINNER BASICS**  

**I want to start smoking

You need a pipe, and a tamper, as well as pipe cleaners for cleaning the pipe afterwards.
Question: What kind of pipe should I get? What matters in a pipe?
As a beginner, corn cobs, and meerschaums. Get something that fits in your budget and that you like. The shape, size of the bowl, bend in the pipe, as well as other aesthetic and practical features can be figured out later. Don’t over think your first pipe.

**What kind of tobacco should I get?** 

You should get 3 different types of tobacco. An English, but it will give you variety and allow you to figure out what you like and don’t like.

**What should I use to light with?**

Any soft flame lighter or matches will work. There is a lot of information about thermodynamic about lighting a pipe and what not, depending on where I am and the conditions. Stay away from hard flames or torch lighters because they can burn through the wood.

**How do I smoke?**

You must first pack your pipe, there are lots of different packing methods, but the easiest for a beginner is to fill the bowl, tamp or push the tobacco to the half way point, fill again, tamp to the ¾ mark, and then heap the tobacco over a bit and tamp to completely fill. Light it once, tamp it down, and try to keep the top of the tobacco level so that it smokes evenly. The point is to keep the ignited embers close to fresh tobacco.
You will also want to keep in mind that you should not be inhaling any smoke. Simply puff the smoke by drawing it into your mouth and blowing it back out. Some people can’t understand how this is possible

**What do I need to do for aftercare?** 

When you have finished smoking, from mouth piece to the inside of the bowl. Then wipe the inside of the bowl down with a pipe cleaner by bending it in half. Please note that not all pipes will be able to accommodate the pipe cleaner making it through the airway in one shot. Take the stem off after the bowl has cooled and finish cleaning. Do this after every smoke. You can smoke the pipe again after about an hour or two of rest. The bowl has to dry out, and contrary to popular belief a day of rest is not necessary, it was a marketing trick to sell more pipes about 50 years ago.

**Is smoking bad for me?**

Yes, do not take my word for it, though. I am going to depart from my comrades here and I will not link to any studies or statistics about smoking, there are decent amounts of information out there, most of it done in Europe, so research it yourself to fully understand the effects. Otherwise I could just be cherry picking studies I’ve found and be feeding you bad information, but you should talk to medical physician about the health effects if you are concerned.

Tamper: a tool to push the embers and tobacco down inside of the bowl.

1332211421.0,r4hug,Tobacco Guide,pipeweed,56,6,24,"**Virginia** - Virginia tobacco is the most popular type of tobacco nowadays. It is commonly used for blending with other types of tobaccos, sweet

*Recommended Virginias*: Reiner Long Golden Flake (my personal favorite), McClelland Christmas Cheer, McClelland Blackwoods Flake

**English** - English blends are made using several different types of tobacco. They usually have a Virginia base, Latakia, or Perique tobaccos). The most common of these is Latakia, which is the component that really gives English blends their distinctive ""smoky"" characteristic. They traditionally have no added flavorings. English blends aren't for everyone (especially the room note), but many people enjoy them because of their bolder flavors.

*Recommended English Blends*: Dunhill Nightcap, Samuel Gawith Squadron Leader, Sillem's Black (although I guess this is a latakia-based aromatic)


**Aromatic** - Aromatic blends are the ones that smell really good and are most of what tobacconists sell in the big glass jars (most of these bulk tobaccos are re-named Lane or Altadis blends). They are most commonly made with a Cavendish base, maple, etc.). The goal is to make them taste and smell great, but the unwanted side effect is that some aromatic blends burn rather hot and can leave a goopy residue in the bottom of your pipe. Therefore, it is important to smoke them slowly to avoid ""tongue bite,"" and to be vigilant about running a post-smoke pipe cleaner through your bowl and stem.

*Recommended Aromatics*: Lane 1-Q, Boswell Christmas Cookie or Berry Cobbler, Cornell &amp; Diehl Autumn Evening


**Burley** - Burley is a type of tobacco that is always ""air-cured"" and it is usually the kind pictured hanging in barns. It has a lower sugar content than Virginia tobacco, which has a ""nutty"" taste. If you have/had a pipe-smoking grandfather (who lived in the U.S.), he most likely smoked some sort of Burley, as many of the classic American pipe tobacco blends are predominately Burley.

*Recommended Burleys*: Prince Albert, Hearth &amp; Home Classic Burley Kake",,False,self,t5_2rbzz,True,,

So the tl;dr is - **sit tight!** I'll be reaching out to all of you over the course of the next week. ~250 responses definitely took me by surprise.

Also I'm going to have to stop accepting new requests; I'll hopefully be able to accommodate the vast majority of those that replied  (I'm limiting it to 2 pipes per person) but I'm definitely at the limit.

Alright guys and gals

I've been seeing a lot of blogs posts as of lately and if I see that it is getting to the point of spamming for traffic

Some of the rules may not seem very applicable at this time but I want to get them in place before we get too large.

My tongue and throat started swelling, and the old familiar itching started... first behind my knees and in my armpits and then spreading to my whole body.  Luckily I knew what was going on so I grabbed some water and my handy dandy Epipen (just in case), and let it take its course.  After about half an hour all was well, so luckily I did not get enough to do anything more than give me a good scare.

And to be honest... Growing up in a family of cigarette smokers, was a gentleman (who would later turn out to be my gov't history teacher in high school) puffing away on a pipe with a blend that smelled of a delicious smokey hot cocoa. Most likely, it was simply some generic ""cheap"" aromatic but it completely changed my perspective in that tobacco smoke was **not** intrinsically a thing o be hated. It did not hurt, though, that as I passed him to find my seat, a lovely young lady stopped to tell him how wonderful his pipe smelled.

That incident

My story. I was smoking in my favorite spot at home, large deck to the side, many birds in the day, and few trees for a clear star filled view at night. It was midday and the wife was getting ready to go shopping. Well she finished before my smoke was done and since the blend wasn't doing it for me that day, i decided to forgo saving the last 1/4 bowl, and I dumped it all in the usual spot, the rock pile next to the drainspout. Fast forward three days to this morning. As always when I'm outside the dog continually drops his ball in front of my feet. This time as I was heading toward the door he droped the ball and it rolled off the deck and into the rock pile by the spout. I went to pick it up to throw it and found the wood surrounding the pile to be partialy burned out. It really hit me hard. What if it had burned the house down?! I don't know what i would have done if it had. I haven't even lived here a year, and our first baby is on it's way.

The sliver of my house dedicated to pipes and pipe tobacco - a space squeezed between a punching bag and a wall - was overrun by tobacco acquisition disorder (let's call it by its full name - takes away the fear): Tobacco tins piled on the workbench

So spring cleaning began. And I'd like /r/pipetobacco to benefit. **I'm giving away four batches of pipe tobacco

Why am I giving them away? Because I still have a weenie-shrinking backlog of new tins to open

Pics of the cleaning results and the groups of tobacco: http://imgur.com/a/Kj6Vm.

***How do I get my hands on this amazing smokable jetsam

Excellent question

Here are the rules:

   * ~~If you'd like to throw your proverbial hat into the proverbial ring for the not proverbial tobacco
   * I will write down all the names of those who commented and randomly pick four people. Or I will have my toddler son randomly pick people. Or I will ask the crackhead guy who keeps pooping in my driveway to randomly pick people. My point is that it's random.
   * ***Wait
   * You must be in the United States. This is because I am using flat-rate USPS boxes to send the tobacco. Note: I have no idea if there are such things as flat-rate USPS boxes
   * You must be the age of majority (or at least of smoking age) in your state and my state (spoiler: I'm in California
   * Know that I'm a hobbyist and not a tobacco merchant. Each of the bags I'm sending out has the date that I opened the tin. Since then, etc. - you take this at your own risk. A couple of the tobaccos came out of the tin drier than I like, but I'm sure you can address that because you are resourceful and handsome.
   * You must be a nice person.

I will edit this post with an update when entries are no longer being taken, and will announce the winners after.

Have at it.

As we all know, most men smoked a pipe, cigars, shag or chewed tobacco. These days, it's mostly cigarettes and to a lesser degree cigars. A nice example would be [chapter 30](http://www.mobydickthewhale.com/moby-dick/moby-dick-chapter-30.htm) of Herman Melville's Moby Dick. 

*""How now, ""this smoking no longer soothes. Oh, my pipe! hard must it go with me if thy charm be gone!

What business have I with this pipe? This thing that is meant for sereneness

*He tossed the still lighted pipe into the sea. The fire hissed in the waves; the same instant the ship shot by the bubble the sinking pipe made. With slouched hat

Ahab just went batshit crazy and threw his pipe in the sea. Because you know

Pipesmoking itself was ingrained in society to such a degree that throwing away a pipe stood model for going crazy. That's hardly imaginable in the time period we're living in

The decline in popularity has had great consequences on the market for pipes and pipe tobacco’s. Hundreds

Mediumsized manufacturers had difficulties competing with larger companies; what remains now are individual pipemakers and large companies.

Lots of companies are experiencing problems and have to outsource large processes to other companies: Stanwell’s aren’t made in Denkmark anymore

Many manufacturers have problems getting the briar they need; it’s not uncommon to only get two-third to half of the amount of the blocks they order. While we’re at it

Even worse

I feel that the large companies

 On the other hand, reading and watching Tolkien and other fantasy novels or simply enjoying the act of smoking a pipe to relax from a day of working. 

Something is definitely going on (even this subreddit is growing every day), Gandalf and the dwarves and lots of other series and movies) really help?

Here's my analysis of each.


**Head shops**  
Typically found near colleges (is there a college of 5k+ students in the US that does NOT have a head shop within a 15-minute walk of campus?), with a small sign by the sidewalk and a set of stairs leading down to the shop.  420 and Bob Marley imagery can be prominent.  Often prominently feature a sign to the effect of, ""These products are for TOBACCO use only, including the water pipes. If you call them 'bongs' we will have to ask you to leave.""  K2, Spice, Nitrous, and VCR head cleaners were/are also very common.  


Worth checking out to see the glass pipes and glass art


**Discount cigarette / tobacco shops**  
Typically found right off the highway, sometimes ones that formerly contained a convenience store or gas station, or that just don't quite seem to be good for any other purpose.  If they are in a low-tax state, expect to right them right off the highway, right near the state line.  The word ""Discount"" (or some other value-related term) is often contained in their name, so these are usually pretty easy to guess at when you drive by them.


These shops are mostly catering to the cigarette and RYO crowd.  They will have cheap cigs, and flavored cigarillos ($15/carton for things that would be grape cigarettes were it not for the fact that they have a tobacco wrapper instead of a paper one).  Not much in these shops for pipe smokers, though some shops will have OTC blends and maybe a few cobs.  Occasionally you will see a very small humidor in these shops as well, but it's usually an obvious afterthought.  




**Legit cigar/pipe shops**  
There is usually one of these in the downtown of most mid-size or larger cities, nothing but head shops there).  In other areas, these legit shops can sometimes be found in small strip malls or other areas in middle-to-upper class towns.  Look for ""cigars"" in the name or on the sign, that is usually a good indicator.  Many of these B&amp;Ms will have house blends that are really relabeled bulk blends, and if you ask nicely the employees will often tell you which ones they are, too (""Yeah, our X blend is really Lane 1-Q"").  Most of the shops focus on cigars, but the better ones blend their own custom blends either on site or off site to their specs (Uhle's


With all the anti-smoking laws in effect (can't even smoke in outdoor parks in many areas!)



Understanding which of the three types of a shops a particular shop is at a distance (or via an online listing) isn't always easy, I find Yelp reviews helpful, as many of the reviewers will mention the ""awesome glass pipe"" or ""great cigar"" that they purchased at a shop.  Call the shops if you must, but be specific.  For example, ask ""Do you have Peterson briar pipes?"" instead of, ""Do you sell pipes"", or ""Do you carry Oliva Serie V cigars?"" instead of ""Do you sell tobacco?"".",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/PipeTobacco/comments/1gwx67/a_treatise_on_the_three_types_of_tobacco_shops/

So who's pressin? This is my current bean can press, and out of them the Kake style is my preference. I'm going to try pressing a kake of each of my favorite loose tobaks. 

[Here are some photos](http://imgur.com/a/B8b7b). 

The picture of the pressed tobacco is a beautiful and pungent Kake I just made of HH Black House. I'm currently pressing some Squadron Leader

Pressing tobaccos is a transformational process, producing surprising results.

This bean can press is made from a bush's baked beans can, carved to approximately fit the diameter of the can, and the c clamp is vintage American steel, not that cheap chinese iron crap all the hardware stores have today, which doesn't work (I've tried two of them). Honestly, that was the most difficult piece to acquire. 

The trick is having the foresight to plan to remove the pressed tobacco when the job is done. There are various innovations to employ to this end, applying tension to the webbing and pulling will dislodge the pressed disc. 

It is also a good idea to place a waxed paper, and facilitate removal. 

Tricks to try with the press:

* pressing your own mixed from scratch blends.

* pressing trademarked blends.

* combining blends as layers

Style tip: place embossed or raised surface lettering, so as to press the image into the finished tobacco, creating your own unique mark.

Hope you've enjoyed our little show and tell

Be warned, and considering how much tobacco can be pressed into a small disc, the two activities may lend to one another to significantly increased exposure for financial endangerment. 

Only good smokes to you.

Cheers. 

**edit:** forgot a point about how much tobak to press:

when using loose tobaks, and gravity fill again. finish with another mild hand tamp. the tobak should not be decidedly mashed in there, but firm and not easily yielding to more mild tamping. i have read that by doing this, the compression ratio is something like 1:8 or 1:10, so it's really quite a lot of squishing going on. just experiment, fill, press for a week or two,,1371794971.0,t3_1gqsab

* Clay Pipes ([Penn Valley](http://www.pipeshoppe.com/ps_clay.php) is popular

Reply to this thread with a brief summary of why **you** deserve to win a wonderful new [**Savinelli Duca Carlo**](http://www.milantobacco.com/savinelli_duca_carlo_pipes2.htm).

There is no need to debase yourself here but the better picture you paint of your woefully inadequate situation the greater chance you have at winning!

I won't randomly select a commenter but will let the upvotes decide so, be discerning and send the most deserving redditor to the top here.

Contest will be closed after midnight on Friday

.

Some of you, or passing, know that in 2011, I spent just shy of 9 months working in China.  I was finishing up my undergraduate degree at Northeastern University in Boston and decided I was going to spend my 3rd cooperative experience (kinda like a paid internship) abroad.  I ended up working for a contract manufacturer in southwest China about an hour outside of Shenzhen in a small town outside of the city of Dongguan in the Guangdong province.  During this time I took a vacation to Japan and felt that on the way back I should stop off and see Beijing.  It was a few months from the end of my coop, I had done traveling in southwest China earlier and didn’t feel like i’d have an issue traveling alone.  (For reference, i’m a 6’7’’ white male, so most people were more likely to ask for a photo than to rob me.)

.

So during my stay in Beijing, where [holes in concrete walls were patched with pieces of wooden doors, the rooftops were waterproofed with tarp and cinder blocks, and life was rather dismal](http://imgur.com/a/hckTm).  Full families lived here while their children worked to provide food for them or go to the Beijing universities to hopefully branch out and find a better life.  

.

At this time, something I hadn’t seen my entire time in China.  It was a pipe smoker.  He was an old man, who couldn’t have been any younger than 75, shirtless (mind you it was July) and sitting on an empty milk crate nursing an basket pipe past its prime.  It was held together with black electrical tape wrapped a quarter of an inch thick along the shank and stem, likely from a crack tenon at some point, and was clinging on its last legs.  But this didn’t stop the old man, he just sat there, my heart lept.  Without thinking I hoisted my rucksack over my shoulder and retrieved a small rectangular box.  It was my [Savinelli Piazza](http://imgur.com/a/9ntQH), at him and then at my pipe and myself

.

He retrieved a haggard aluminum tin from his side, i’ll have a quarter of a bowl.”  Nope!  He saw me gingerly put in a small amount and then decided he was going to help me.  He took a heavy pinch, wadded it up and jammed it into my pipe with his thumb while i was holding it.  I reached for my lighter, but before I could take it out, he produced a broken red bic with a crack pipe flame coming out of it.  I took a few puffs and found out that my previous guess was certainly correct. It wasn’t the most pleasurable smoke, but it burned quick, a little hot, and for those of you who enjoy tobacco reviews-- it even burned to a fine white ash.

.

He offered his crate to me and I declined, me in exceptionally broken as fuck mandarin.  We didn’t get too far.  He tried to ask me where I came from, I told him the USA.  He asked me a few other questions I didn’t understand, but if I had to guess, he was asking me why i was here, or what brought me to China.  In the end it didn’t really matter.  We sat there, puffing in silence and simply enjoyed each others company.  As I finished up my bowl I took out a tin of Nightcap and offered it to him, but he wouldn’t have it.  In the end, I asked/gestured for a photograph and then respected his wishes when he declined.  In hindsight I wish I had gotten a picture of the pipe and especially one of us,False

I’ve taken up pipe smoking around two years or so. I don’t know the exact date, then cigars (too expensive), then pipe smoking. I have never met a pipe smoker, so my information was gathered via internet. 

It started with months of research and studying before even picking up a pipe. Lots of reading through forums and watching videos on YouTube etc.  It was surprising how something so seemingly simple led to such an immersion. I became obsessed with reading about different makers, techniques, care and restoration of pipes, oh and tobaccos so much to learn there. It really does make sense that people refer to smoking a pipe as a hobby. 

My research and limited budget led to my purchase of a cheap estate pipe on ebay,  and many alcohol dipped pipe cleaners. At this point there was still the matter of the stem. I could have went with the stem bleach process, micromesh wet sanding, bench polishing etc, but at this point I was simply interested in just cleaning up and smoking the damn thing. 

Which led to my first innovation. Turtle wax, and then wax; all by hand. I can just picture the reactions of some reading this. “Oh no, you must use Tripoli!,” “That’s automotive stuff, it could be toxic!,” “Bwaaahhh!!” My rebuttal would consist of, its cheap, it can be applied by hand

After “restoring” my estate pipe, and how often I would be smoking. But, a worry crept into my mind. I thought to myself, since I only have this one pipe and would like to smoke all of the time; I had better get a hold of more pipes to build up a rotation. 

Over time more pipes were acquired, and salt and alcohol treatments; to remove those “ghosts” that were lurking in every estate pipe. Looking back it is a shame I ever did that to some of those pipes. Sure some were funky, but some gave off such a delightful aroma upon reaming that they never should have been treated. Now of course purists would state all used pipes should be S&amp;A treated, even if the cake does smell and taste delightful; and without treatment you’ll never be able to truly taste an English, or Virginia tobacco. With which, I can’t disagree. Although, it is quite possible to still enjoy these blends with casper lurking in the bowl. Afterall

Anyhow, you’ll mess it up; better go grab the ugliest pipe in the bunch and practice smoking with that.” So that’s just what I did. I kept acquiring and restoring pipes for the all important rotation, whilst still smoking that dented and chewed up old estate pipe. 

Bowl after bowl went by

Day in day out, and the pipe stayed lit. Overtime I slacked with cleaning and did experience a “sour pipe.” I put this in quotations not because it doesn’t exist, but due to the fact that it doesn’t exist in the sense it is described as. It is simply a bad taste that develops due to saliva, moisture, and tobacco juices in the pipe. Yes it is gross, yes it does impart a bad taste to the pipe.  But, it is completely removed with a good alcohol cleaning. 

Which led to my current practice of running a pipe cleaner through after every bowl, and pipe cleaners after 10 bowls or whenever I feel like it.  This seems to work, and results in good tastes, and no clogs, or gurgling even with the goopiest of aromatics. This practice has led to many enjoyable smokes back to back, but wait how can this be that pipe hasn’t had a chance to dry out! It hasn’t had a proper rest. 

Ah, and scratched and beat to hell old estate pipe. The hope was that this old pipe would somehow by miracle withstand this smoking with no resting, and all allow me a little time to develop a proper smoking technique. 

How can a pipe be smoked bowl after bowl (sometimes not even allowed to cool, or a permanent souring. After all the briar absorbs moisture and needs a chance to release it. Maybe the moisture in the wood would get heated upon smoking, and lead to every subsequent bowl stinging the users tongue with steam causing a horrible heat bite. 

Well, the lack of resting resulted in no damage to the pipe, and many, many enjoyable smokes. In fact I still smoke that pipe daily, years after picking up smoking. I now would consider my smoking technique sufficient to enjoy my other pipes, but a funny thing happened. 

I grew to love that little pipe. It is always here by my side. I have simply grown accustomed to its characteristics. Day in, the principle of rotation mislead me into the purchase of my pipes, but P.A.D. is the reason I have kept them. 

One must keep in mind the nature of pipe smoking. The purpose of which is ultimately enjoyment. Which can range from the enjoyment a nicotine addict gets from their fix, all can agree on that. 

My point is that pipe smoking can be enjoyed by all

Although PAD and TAD are worthwhile. Satisfaction is granted upon experiencing an enjoyable smoke; fulfillment is obtained when one has reached a level of immersion that they are content with. Although some may never reach fulfillment

TL, I decided to go to Morganville, which is what they called Shelbyville in those days. So I tied an onion to my belt, which was the style at the time. Now, to take the ferry cost a nickel, and in those days, nickels had pictures of bumblebees on 'em. Give me five bees for a quarter

Now where were we? Oh yeah: the important thing was I had an onion on my belt

I would mainly like to discuss tobacco reviews as I think this is the area that has the most to gain with the advent of the internet.   
    
I used to do most of my research on a tobacco on sites like [tobaccoreviews.com](http://www.tobaccoreviews.com). The combination of an active user base and a database of many blends makes it a useful tool for research. The problem with tobacco reviews  in my opinion (as well as many other websites of a similar nature) is that most of the reviews are nearly useless. Below are some of the problems I've noticed with tobacco reviews in general:


1. **There is no indication what so ever of a persons level of experience with a particular tobacco category!**
 
      If you only ever smoke aromatics

2. **The language of the reviews is often poetic and anecdotal rather than actually useful.**

     I find that many reviews for tobacco often relate someone's personal experience (often in a borderline religious/poetic way) with the tobacco they are reviewing. Often times the review will contain very little useful information about the physical tobacco. I've been known to do a little freestyle when I get a good pipe going but this information serves no purpose in a tobacco review and would be better placed on a blog.

3. **Subjectivity makes many reviews impossible to make sense of.**

     Admittedly there is no accounting for taste but it seems to be that describing one tobacco in terms of another tobacco might be more useful than a vague concept of ""fruitiness"" or ""camp fire flavor"". Direct comparison in my opinion is far better. Take [r/pipetobacco](http://www.reddit.com/r/PipeTobacco/) reviewer ReverendVerse's line in a recent review: *""By adding in red and black virginias and orientals, but still maintains it's strong flavor that latakia is known for.""*. This is a great example of good language to use in a review. It establishes a great basis for comparison. 

I hope the long winded post wasn't too boring

**tl;dr** I think tobacco reviews could use improvement (see comment below) and am thinking about starting a blog/website to see if I could fix some of the problems I perceive in how we currently review pipe tobacco and ultimately explain our hobby to newbies.
