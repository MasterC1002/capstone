I started off the season a hardcore clippers fan (and still am). Being from Louisiana, something strange began to happen with me. As I learned more and more about Kobe, read interviews, watched him play, heard his post game comments I began to develop an incredible respect for him. This respect grew in to grudging admiration and before I knew it, I was a fan. In the past couple weeks this feeling has only intensified. Something about the drama of the Lakers season began drawing me in in a big way. Now suddenly I find myself rooting for them every single game, rooting for them just as strongly as the Clips. It just dawned on me tonight, that I'm all in.

1362166037.0,19h96e,"Lakers Post ASG Race to the Playoffs, Week 1 Update!",Joelo246,210,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/19h96e/lakers_post_asg_race_to_the_playoffs_week_1_update/, it's bad for us. If everyone is at 0, second is predicted result.

This thread will be updated daily and once a week I'll do a weekly update.

**Summary of the week**: Lakers gain solid ground on all 3 teams ahead of them post ASG with a 4-1 run compared to 3-3 for GSW, and need a lot more solid weeks like this before we lock up a playoff spot.

**We Gives thanks to...**: Monta Ellis for that absurd buzzer beater to put away Houston... David Lee for getting suspended from what ended up being a 4 point loss to NYC after 54 from Curry... Kobe for looking like he was still 28 and dominant all week... Boston for losing to us the day after the great Jerry Buss's passing

**Lakers predicted finish** : 20-8 to finish at 45-37

**Actual Finish (So far)** : 7-2

**+/- Against predicted pace** : +1

**Games out of 8th** : .5

**Schedule Strength** : 12 of lakers last 23 games are against current playoff teams. 5 of those 12 are against elite playoffs teams (&gt;60% win %) plus Chicago on the cusp (58.5%). They have 9 games against basement teams (&lt;40% win %) and 10 against mid-range teams (40-60%). 11 are at home and 12 on the road.

**Analysis** : Lakers schedule is not impossible

**Weekly Update**: This was a very solid week for the lakers. We took care of business in two very close games against teams that were virtually tied with us - Portland and Dallas. We got a revenge win on Boston, and Dwight has looked engaged on defense every game. Only loss was in Denver... and honestly, back to back in Denver where they are 24-3 (2nd best home record in the NBA) - that would've been a really tough one for us to win, and it was okay to drop it. That said, 4-1 in the first week doesn't gain us any games on the pace we need - it just keeps us on track. We got ATL, OKC, NOH, if we can win 3 of those 5 we will be in great shape.

**Player of the Week**: Kobe Bryant (easy pick, and blew off his cold outside shooting by going 9/21 from deep over the week. Kobe Averaged 31.2/6.8/6.4 on 55.8% shooting over the week and POWERED lakers through to a 4-1 week. 

**Daily Update** : Oh my god. I don't think I've watched two back-to-back regular season games EVER by the lakers that were that up and down and that exciting. Part of that is because the lakers regular season games have never mattered this much, this guy must be taking it. 3 three in the last 2 minutes to force overtime, are you kidding me? All that said, I'm torn between feeling like we are SCREWED in the playoffs if our defense is going to put us in these kind of holes against bad teams like NO and TOR, and excited to see the team perform so well under pressure. Watching Nash and Kobe take shots in the 4th is fucking exciting right now, because both of them are just making all the big ones. Pumped my fist every time Rudy Gay took a shot too, he cant make shit outside 10 feet (derozan made a few ridiculous ones though). At the end of the day, and that's what matters. I just hope we can improve our defensive fundamentals while riding this crazy mojo down the stretch. Chicago at home next will be a very tough one

**Golden State Warriors predicted finish** : 15-15 to finish 45-37

**Actual Finish (So far)** : 5-6

**+/- Against predicted pace** : +0

**Games Ahead of Lakers** : 3 (6.5 before All-Star break)

**Schedule Strength** : 10 of their final 25 are against playoff teams, 11 against mid-range teams. 16 of 25 are at home.

**Analysis** : GSW's schedule is pretty favourable, plus a loss to utah already since the break, so if they can't get their mojo back they could be knocked out of the playoffs directly by the teams around them.

**Weekly Update**: It's been a roller coaster week in Golden State. Bogut's gone back out. Curry's in god mode. Lee got suspended on the eve of a really important game in New York for brawling in Indiana. They somehow beat San Antonio to get ahead of the pace

**Player of the Week**: Gotta be Stephen Curry. Shows a little of the ""eff you"" mode that few NBA players have

**Daily Update** : Golden State loses its first of 5 games against its three playoff rivals, shooting 6/8 from 3 for 26 points on 13 shots. Harden gets his usual 20/6/11, Asik gets 17 boards, Klay Thompson and Stephen Curry continue to be one of the sickest shooting backcourts in the league (combined 46 points and 7/14 from 3), Bogut plays 28 decent minutes but can't contribute on offense (1/5... one 3 made??).

**Utah Jazz predicted finish** : 13-15 to finish 43-39

**Actual Finish (So far)** : 2-6

**+/- Against predicted pace** : -1

**Games Ahead of Lakers** : .5 (5.5 before ASG)

**Schedule Strength** : 12 of 22 games against playoff teams

**Analysis** : Utah's schedule is tough. With 10 elite opponents and a vulnerable roster

**Weekly Update**: Rough week for Utah was expected - they were playing 4 solid playoff teams. Most experts and fans are coming around to the idea that Utah is the most likely to drop out of the playoffs, starting with games against Charlotte, Milwaukee and Cleveland, but if they drop ANY of those we'll be in great shape.

**Player of the Week**: Gordon Hayward has been quietly killing it off the bench all week

**Daily Update** : Chicago hands Utah a very tightly contested 89-88 loss, and Oklahoma/Memphis/New York/Houston next week... good luck Utah!

**Complete** : GSW(W-W), ATL(L-L) | CHA(W-W), @MIL(L-W), @CLE(L-L), @CHI(L-L)

**Houston Rockets predicted finish** : 15-12 to finish 44-38

**Actual Finish (So far)** : 5-3

**+/- Against predicted pace** : +0

**Games Ahead of Lakers** : 2 (3.5 before ASG)

**Schedule Strength** : 9 of 22 games against playoff teams
against trash and 8 against mid-range teams. 13 of 22 at home

**Analysis** : Houston's schedule is pretty easy

**Weekly Update**: Of the three teams ahead of us, OKC) and losing both games I expected them to win (WAS, MIL). At this point this is a classic team that lives and dies by the 3 and can beat or lose to any team on any night. So where will they finish? Fuck if I know, I'm 0/4 on predicting them so far.

**Player of the Week**: I guess we have to default this to James Harden after he willed his team past former team OKC with a ridiculous night - 46 points on an absurd 19 shots to go with 8 boards and 6 assists. For the week James averaged 30/5/6 on 52% FG and 50% 3PT%. 

**Daily Update** : Won't recap this one much as I did above

**Complete** : OKC(W-L), MIL(L-W) | @ORL(W-W), DAL(W-W), @DAL(L-L), @GSW(W-W)

**Incomplete** :@PHX(X-W), GSW(X-W), UTA(X-W), CLE(X-W), SAS(X-L), IND(X-L), @MEM(X-L), ORL(X-W), PHX(X-L), @LAL(X-L)

**Tie Breakers As per request** :

* Summary: Utah &gt; Lakers

* Lakers: Needs 1 more win to have season series over Golden State. Need one more win to tie up series with Houston. Have already lost season series vs Utah. vs Utah(L, vs Houston(W,L,L,X,), vs Golden State (W,X

I'm sorry dudes. Seriously. The picture of Kobe on the side bar is epic, confusing, and all of the above. We lost Rose to injury this season - but shit, man. Even I felt the loss when they announced Kobe's injury. I'm sorry Howard acted like a piece of shit the last game, I'm sorry that Kobe didn't get his full chance at another ring and I hope his accomplishments won't be forgotten as LeBron goes on a fucking rampage of the finals for the next few years.

I hope you guys are back to full strength next year.

EDIT: [Pictures!](http://imgur.com/a/Td8c6#0)

**In my opinion, cryptic directions, and the players would sometimes look at him perplexed, then just carry on doing whatever they were doing.  The only direction I saw them actually react to was ""Line!"" when they had an out of bounds play, and that's something you learn to do in grade school.  

When the Lakers would make a bad play and then get caught fouling

When Metta fouled out

I've said it before, and now we don't let him dribble.  Nash is just following orders and passing around, and Kobe is always going to be a black hole in that type of system, so at that point, the rotation stops and Nash watches from the sideline.

If you say ""at least he's a defensive coach"", it seemed too easy for the Blazers to draw out both Pau and Dwight which led to short jumpers by big men, or open long range jumpers with Blazers in rebounding position.  A consistently good defensive team should strive to keep teams in the 80s.  We're allowing 107.5.

EDIT: 

A couple more things I wanted to say about Coach Brown that I was reminded about in comments:

* One of the biggest problems I saw from a direct coaching perspective in the first two games was the substitution pattern. We have 3 superstars (and Pau who's no slouch). So to have a team that could at least put up some points, or Nash and Dwight, and have plenty of rest for whoever's not involved. Brown spent a huge amount of time with Pau + 4 scrubs. They were just lost and Pau had to force the issue.

* As for the bench, Meeks and Hill will be able to produce. Right now, they're just given the ball and told to score, and then they lose confidence when they fail. This may change as they get more comfortable with the system.

* As for Brown's credentials as a coach, you come less prepared, so having a talent like Lebron can take you far.  I assume he contributed in winning championships under Popovich, but as far as I've seen, he's still unproven as an elite coach.

**The good things I take from this game:**

* Dwight's free throws looked amazing.  Chuck Person's advice might have made a difference, but you know how that ended up).

* With no real offensive scheme

* With Dwight being assertive with the ball and a threat without

* If we keep losing like this

* In person

**Side note:**
NBA refs are pretty damn awesome.  Bill Kennedy was the head ref.  Not only does he have massive guns, forcing to Brown shut up.  And then after every quarter, Kennedy would come to the scorers table with a smile saying ""great job guys!""  I can understand why replacement refs in sports would have a huge impact on the sport.",,False,,t5_2qhv6,,http://www.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/12gyr6/my_perspective_of_coach_brown_from_sitting/

Before we got Brown, and had a great record in recent years) and because he was cheaper ($4.5mil/year vs Adelman who made $6.9 mil/year with Hou). I gave him some time in the hopes that he would prove me wrong, but I didn't like what I saw, and it hasn't improved since.

**Defense:**

Coach is known for defense and won a championship as an assistant under Popovich. He seems to have an above-average defensive scheme. This helped us have decent defensive numbers last year, 103.7 OPA in 2008 against Orlando).

The 11-12 Lakers had decent defensive numbers

**Offense**

This is where Coach Brown has often been criticized, and his teamplay made his role players very effective similar to other greats like Magic, Jordan, Nash, etc.  

Once you hit the playoffs, but that isn't enough to win a title.

The 11-12 Lakers had offensive issues throughout the entire season. Kobe was able to score, and the rest of the team's efficiency followed, especially in the playoffs (Pau 12.5 PPG in the playoffs). Our bench was terrible, but I'll expand on that later.

The fact that he decided to try the Princeton Offense shows that he understands that he's deficient in this area. I was looking forward to the Princeton Offense since it would force some ball movement

For those who say that Adelman runs the motion offense, but he'd been doing it forever, and even when we screwed it up, you didn't see long stretches of games where the entire offensive scheme was ineffective like you do right now.

**Bench play**

The fans, but I believe this is more evidence of coaching failure rather than weak personnel.  

Benches for the last 5 championship seasons:

2009-2010: Odom, Vujacic, Walton, Mbenga, Powell, Morrison

2008-2009: Odom, Vujacic, Walton, Mbenga, Powell, Morrison, Radmanovic, Mihm

2001-2002: Shaw, Hunter, Madsen, McCoy, Medvedenko, Penberthy, Richmond

2000-2001: Foster, Lue, Madsen, Medvedenko, Penberthy, Rider, Shaw

1999-2000: Celestand, Harper, Horry, Jacobson, Knight, Lue, Salley

Our bench:
Blake, Hill, Jamison, Meeks, Morris, Sacre, Clark

We've had some great role players (Big Shot Rob, and we have fond selective memories of great moments when certain guys stepped up (Brown, Farmar, Walton, Vujacic). However, especially looking at the recent back to back championships, our bench was never extremely deep. One of the coach's main jobs and one of the main goals of having a working offensive scheme is getting the bench to play effectively. Every team deals with this problem when the starters are on the bench. You have to give Phil and the triangle credit for getting decent contributions from the bench. Look at those same contributors and see how they've fared after Phil brought up their stock

**Playoff coaching**

As I mentioned in another thread

First, I began to notice that he would keep Kobe in long stretches of the game, partially because his lack of offense required a creator, and Kobe was the only one capable, and partially because I think he's just doesn't see the big picture. Even with his experimental knee surgery rejuvenating him, he jumped back up to 38.5 minutes a game at age 33. I could remember a few of our comfortable wins, Brown would be pissed at the bench giving up part of a lead, the starters would close out the game

Against OKC last season, and by having a system that doesn't depend on Kobe exerting himself just to get points.

When the Cavs got knocked out during Lebron's time, and the rest of the team wasn't mentally prepared to step up and make plays. When your team just looks completely different from the team that excelled with less pressure, that's a good sign of bad coaching.

**Conclusion**

So when Kobe tells people to be patient and that things will improve, and he's also resorted to playing hero-ball late since he doesn't trust his teammates in this system.

When Nash was interviewed against the Clippers

The 0-8 preseason record for me is inconsequential, often leading until the 4th in which they would either not play the starters and lose (lack of a system for the bench), or they would lose the lead even with the starters (pointless overworking of the starters). The Lakers have never had a great record in preseason from what I remember, and I believe that's perfectly fine since they know it doesn't matter.

So far, and they really didn't have the personnel to compete defensively.  Detroit is currently ranked last in Stein's power rankings. I give credit to the teams in our four losses for playing well, but it was especially discouraging that none of the losses were close.  In every case, we would fall to a double digit lead for most of the game. We would have stretches where we would cut it to single digits, but then we would just fall apart with turnovers and with a lack of defensive consistency.

I believe health, I don't see that as enough to lift us to a title. Home court advantage is not the most crucial thing. However, a team's standing at the end of the regular season is usually a good sign of a team's general health looking toward the playoffs. Since our threepeat in 2000, no team has won the championship seeded lower than 3rd in their conference, and 5 times, it was a #1 seed that won. So as an indicator of championship potential, the regular season is important. If you can't get some sort of consistent flow in the regular season, we've been a great team with occasional periods of funk. Starting the season 1-4 is a very ominous sign.

Dwight is a cancer.

We dodged a $120 million cancer bullet that would have left us gasping for air by the second year of the contract.

You give a massive contract like that to Dwight

* a player whose post ""moves"" and offensive skill set look like they came from a cereal box flap yet demands to be the go-to scorer and complaining about touches.  Remember that running hook that Dwight loves so much?  It's so robotic and predictable that Marc Gasol swatted that shit like 5 times in a row and Dwight still kept trying it. 
* a player who passive-aggressively badmouths his teammates like he thinks we're all as oblivious as he is
* a player who responds to a 30 point game 3 loss by getting ejected in game 4 in just 20 minutes when in a position where he called himself the leader.  BTW
* “He gets the ball on offense, people come and take the ball from him or tie his arms up. Offensively, he doesn't get it. Hasn't made any progress. We (the Lakers, when Abdul-Jabbar was a special assistant coach) played them in '09, and when I saw him this past season, he was the same player.” - Kareem
* a player who shoots 50% from the free throw line
* a player who can't even stay out of foul trouble because he keeps getting offensive fouls trying to post up like a dancing inflatable man by flailing his arms around and hoping for a call when he really just can't post up
* a player who never takes accountability and keeps blaming his issues on other people and the coach when Kobe
* When Kobe offered to show him what it means to be a winner: ""I'm already a winner.""  LOL
* ""But at the end of the day
* a player that requires an offense be built around him, yet becomes a liability anyway
* when his athleticism falters
* he has a back injury that remains a question mark and/or a convenient excuse for him to use when he has a bad game.  

After a win:

""I'm feeling healthier.  Back is feeling strong again.  Everyone touched the ball.""

After a loss:

""We didn't share the ball enough.  My back is not 100%.  I think it's around &lt;insert random % pulled out of ass here that changes every week&gt;.""

I'm not even salty.  I'm ecstatic.  I just want people to know that what happened was a blessing in disguise.  Even when we had him we were barely a playoff team.  If we suck and we end up in the lottery

He's not a god damn power forward. He's just not. So stop trying to make him one Pringles! I truly believe that he's just as valuable as Dwight is. At least for the next 2 years or so...

Pau is my fucking boy

Resigning dwight has to be the priority but if we can't then blowing the team up is not the next best option. Having pau as the center and finding free agents to work with him and kobe and nash is.

---
**Q: Can the Lakers straight-up sign Chris Paul?**

A: No

**Q: Wait... the NBA has a salary cap?**

A: Crazy

**Q: Can they even offer Chris Paul a contract?**

A: Yes, the maximum MLE they can offer a free agent comes out to roughly $9 million/3 years. Alternatively, the Lakers can offer Paul the league minimum, roughly $480,000. Would the best point guard in the NBA settle for either of these figures? No.

**Q: But wait! You can sign over the salary cap and just pay more in luxury taxes

A: You cannot sign a free agent to a contract that would place you above the salary cap

**Q: Okay, kill Steve Nash and blame it on Jason Richardson, etc...**

A: Because of Kobe Bryant's $30 million he makes next year which already takes up half of the cap,795 in its first year. Yes, they can take less money to pair together like LeBron, Bosh and Wade, but let's say you amnesty Metta and somehow trade Pau for picks and a bag of basketballs. There's Steve Nash's contract. There's Jordan Hill's contract. There's Steve Blake's contract. There's Chris Duhon's contract (though he'll likely be bought out). So essentially, you can have one but not both.

Now

**Q: Is there any possible avenue in which the Lakers can have a starting five with CP3

A: Yes. But it's a stretch. Per the 2011 Collective Bargaining Agreement, stand at $8 million over the threshold. Therefore, the only way for the Lakers to have all three of Chris Paul, Dwight Howard, and Kobe Bryant on the same team next year for max contracts is to trade Pau Gasol to a team with enough cap space to absorb Pau Gasol's $19,285,850 for a trade exception without incurring any salary in return in order to sink the Lakers far beneath the luxury tax threshold.

Then, under the new CBA, you are not allowed to a bird-rights max deal, so it would have to be for the standard max of $17.7 million with 4.5% annual raises. Finally, LA could sign Dwight to a bird rights max deal.

An alternate scenario would be like the one above, just under the luxury tax threshold, then put together a sign-and-trade with the Clippers surrounding Pau Gasol and Chris Paul. 

Again

**Q: So you're telling me there's a chance?**

A: Yes

With the second scenario

Personally, and he has cemented himself as the leader of the Clipper franchise and has already shown that he has weight when it comes to front office decisions.

**tl;dr: There's a salary cap. The Lakers are over it. By a lot. CP3 won't be in purple and gold next season unless Mitch Kupchak tweaks with the Association Settings**

EDIT: I don't English good.

That difference, while Jordan is the unanimous GOAT. But...is that truly the case?

An interesting statistical tid-bit that most people haven't realized yet

http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jordami01.html

http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/bryanko01.html

This can mainly be attributed to Jordan's ridiculous 22.9 FGA, shoots a ""paltry"" 19.6 FGA over his career. 

Here's the thing though

That's it. 

If we take into account Kobe's average efficiency per shot taken (PPWS)

What does this all mean? Well it means that over their whole careers, he would have the exact same efficiency as Jordan. Are you really telling me that 0.23 made shots a game, is the only thing separating Kobe from Jordan? The difference between the 10 - 15th spots in the greatest pantheon of NBA players, and the GOAT? 

People might say that my logic is faulty, and TS%, Kobe's numbers (48.7% eFG, 55.5% TS) isn't that far off from Jordan's (50.9% eFG, 56.9% TS). When you take into account their output over their whole careers, it's surprising that with Jordan's reputation as the greatest scorer in NBA history, that Kobe is breathing right down his neck. 

In fact, AND James Harden-like foul drawing ability.)

Another fun tidbit: Had Kobe taken the same amount of shots as the great Michael Jordan (22.9 - 19.6

0.3 PPG

Ultimately, and win more individual accolades. (Whether Kobe's lack of MVPs and other awards is due to media influence or personal accomplishment is another matter entirely). In their primes, I'd take Jordan more times than not. Defensively, Jordan reached a level of dominance Kobe has only managed in spurts. 

But offensively? It's a lot closer than you would imagine. I'm willing to go so far as to say that Kobe is the best offensive weapon this league has ever seen. He has sustained a level of offensive production most players can only dream of,False,,t5_2qhv6,False,,,t3_1kfaft

If we're looking for a speedy spark off the bench that can get to into the lane and get hot from three


**Austin Daye PF | 6-11 | 200 | Age 25**
Austin Daye was the 15th pick of the 2009 NBA Draft. He spent 3 years in Detroit stuck on the bench behind Greg Monroe, but may need to bulk up his Tayshawn-like frame. Huge upside. With little interest from other teams, he could be acquired for the minimum, leaving the MMLE open for another player, perhaps a SF.


**Lamar Odom PF | 6-10 | 230 | Age 33**
Latest news is that [the Lakers have reached out to Lamar](http://www.cbssports.com/nba/blog/eye-on-basketball/22665100/report-lakers-have-reached-out-to-lamar-odom). Truth is he has been down right horrible in his 2 years away from the Lakers. He has seemed unmotivated. Perhaps reuniting with Kobe will ignite a fire in Lamar. If he signs with the Lakers


**Nick Young SG/SF | 6-7 | 210 | Age 28**
When he gets hot, or perhaps starting at the SF. He's young and athletic, but his defense and decision making are the only questions. He has potential, just needs focus. With Kobe mentoring him, I think he could develop really well.


**Carlos Delfino SF | 6-6 | 230 | Age 30**
Delfino could potentially start at the SF if Metta is amnestied. He's a career 36% three point shooter


**Rodrigue Beaubois PG | 6-2 | 185 | Age 25**
Mark Cuban was in love with this kid, but he excels in transition. These are all things the Lakers could use. Especially the speed.


**Wes Johnson SF | 6-7 | 205 | Age 25**
Former #4 pick. He's inconsistant, he's a great slasher, he can knock it down from 3 and can defend. He's incredibly athletic. I'd take my chances, what is there to lose?


**Reggie Williams SF | 6-6 | 205 | Age 26**
Who? [This guy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NzpWH7IleU). He is a natural born scorer and has developed a great 3 point shot. He's a lefty with long arms. Last year he was stuck behind MKG in Charlotte. I'd get him for the minimum just to see what he can do. We desperately need to fill out the roster


**Sasha Vujacic SG | 6-7 | 205 | Age 29**
Still on the good side of 30, and potentially becoming a starter at the two, with Kobe slipping down to the three. Maybe I just love Sasha too much. No-homo. But, really, homo. But no. On a more serious note, we could easily get him for the vets min. [Mutual interest apparently](http://fansided.com/2013/07/02/nba-free-agency-sasha-vujacic-wants-to-play-for-los-angeles-lakers/).

He's a decent defender due to the fact that he's pretty long


**Alan Anderson SG/SF | 6-6 | 220 | Age 30**
A tough defender. If we want defense


My prediction: Nick Young takes the MMLE. Wes Johnson, Will Bynum and Corey Brewer will be snapped up for a price we can't afford.

2013-14 Lakers

PG - Steve Nash/Steve Blake

SG - Nick Young/Sasha Vujacic/Jodie Meeks

SF - Kobe Bryant/Wes Johnson

PF - Lamar Odom/Austin Daye/Ryan Kelly

C - Pau Gasol/Jordan Hill/Sacre

This thread will be updated daily and once a week I'll do a weekly update.

**Summary of the week**: As excellent as last week was, Utah Freefell 1-3 while Houston is the only team we didn't gain ground on with a matching 3-1. This was an amazing week not just for the clutch performance by LA, but because both Golden State and Utah dropped key games to bad teams (PHI, MIL, CLE). With an extremely tough stretch coming up for Utah (New York twice, Memphis, Oklahoma, the Lakers are poised to be in the 8th slot by the end of next week with a legit chance to move up to 7th. With our win over Atlanta we've even given ourselves a little breathing room to be able to take a bad loss somewhere down the stretch - a get out of jail free card that LA somehow managed to avoid spending this week on New Orleans &amp; Toronto. For those scoring at home

**We Gives thanks to...**: Kobe ""Are you fucking kidding me"" Bryant, who must still have a little love for Dwight cause he dropped 8 points in overtime against the Jazz to put them away for us (special shout out to Marvin Williams, Randy Foye &amp; Earl Watson, who all started for Utah that game and combined for... 0 points). Kyrie Irving, for his usual clutchness against Utah in the 4th, dropping a near triple double and helping beat them by 3. Oh, And Marco fucking Bellinelli for the game winning 3 against Utah... jesus

**Lakers predicted finish** : 20-8 to finish at 45-37

**Actual Finish (So far)** : 9-3

**+/- Against predicted pace** : +2

**Games out of 8th** : 0

**Schedule Strength** : 10 of lakers last 19 games are against current playoff teams. 4 of those 10 are against elite playoffs teams (&gt;60% win %). They have 7 games against basement teams (&lt;40% win %) and 8 against mid-range teams (40-60%). 9 are at home and 10 on the road.

**Analysis** : Lakers have done exactly what they needed to do through 2 weeks. They've taken care of business against every team around their level and below, Laker fans can legitimately start feeling like this is a playoff team and start worrying about how the hell we're going to dodge OKC and SAS and get that dream match against the clippers.

**Weekly Update**: For the cynical fans out there, Beating Atlanta by 1 points, NOH by 6, TOR by 2 and losing to OKC by 17. And despite Dwight playing really well, there are still serious we-are-screwed-in-the-playoffs issues with our defense. The way we clamped down on NOH in the 4th offers a bit of hope, but seriously... this week was ugly. From a fan standpoint though, I can't remember the regular season ever having a week this exciting for LA... talk about clutch performances. Dwight's making huge defensive plays. Kobe's been in god mode, with 3 solid eastern playoff teams - Chicago, even 1-3 won't kill us. 

**Player of the Week**: I honestly wish I could put Dwight Howard here. He hasn't been complaining, and has even been more productive on his hook shots. He's setting great screens, working hard to get free and getting LA lots of easy buckets. His performance down the stretch against New Orleans was filthy good and it's a shame he's overshadowed by Kobe. But as with most of his Legacy, Kobe's not the feel good story - he just takes the crown by force. Here are some numbers over the last 4 games: 36.75 PPG, 5.5 RPG, 7.5 APG, 44.8% from 3, and one of those random nonsense records - oldest player ever to drop back-to-back 40/10 games. One of the Sloan basketball articles detailed how good players tend to get better in the clutch because they exert more effort and put their body on the line more down the stretch... and how Kobe is one of the guys who plays at his highest level from behind in the 4th. Talk about a performance for the ages to validate that research. Even the biggest Kobe fans didn't see this week coming. 3 threes in 2 minutes to force overtime

**Daily Update** : Rough night for the Lakers all around. Nights like these are why I created this set of predictions - to remind us that even when things don't break our way, it feels like a blown opportunity. This was a legitimately bad game for Kobe &amp; Nash and we got killed whenever Dwight was out with fouls - Dwight's +10 compared to a bunch of (-) across the board says it all.

**Complete** : BOS(W-W), @DEN(L-L), MIN(W-W) | ATL(W-L), @OKC(L-L), @NOH(W-W), TOR(W-W) | CHI(W-L), @ORL(W-W)

**Incomplete** :@IND(X-L), WAS(X-W), @GSW(X-W), @MIN(X-W), @MIL(X-W), @SAC(X-W), DAL(X-W), @LAC(X-L), SAS(X-W)

**Golden State Warriors predicted finish** : 15-15 to finish 45-37

**Actual Finish (So far)** : 7-7

**+/- Against predicted pace** : -1

**Games Ahead of Lakers** : 3 (6.5 before All-Star break)

**Schedule Strength** : 8 of their final 19 are against playoff teams, 8 against mid-range teams. 13 of 19 are at home.

**Analysis** : Golden State has a nice little home stand coming up against the east, they're a pile of nice shooters and bad defenders. That said, their closing stretch doesn't have many elite teams left on it, so if they can regain their form they still have enough of a cushion to hold LA off.

**Weekly Update**: This will go down as a rough week for Golden State, not the mention the Lakers creeping up on them. And I'm sure LA isn't the only team looking to avoid San Antonio and Oklahoma. These guys are fighting with a lot more success than Utah is though, as Like LAL, GSW took care of business in the 4th against both SAC and TOR in games they were in real danger of losing. 

**Player of the Week**: It's close, 4.6 RPG, and 3.2 APG on 50% from 3 (20/40) and 100% from the line. 

**Daily Update** : What is there to say? Detroit is really bad and Golden State whomped them. Curry had one of his blazing nights

**Complete** : @UTA(L-L), @MIN(W-W), @IND(L-L), @NYK(L-L) | @BOS(L-L), @PHI(L-W), TOR(W-W), SAC(W-W), NYK(W-W)

**Utah Jazz predicted finish** : 13-15 to finish 43-39

**Actual Finish (So far)** : 3-8

**+/- Against predicted pace** : -1

**Games Ahead of Lakers** : -.5 (5.5 before ASG)

**Schedule Strength** : 11 of 20 games against playoff teams

**Analysis** : Well, I expect Utah to tumble straight out of the playoff race over the next two weeks, and for the remaining 3 teams to be fighting for seeds down the stretch.

**Weekly Update**: I'm starting to think Utah doesn't WANT to make the playoffs. They start the week by drubbing Charlotte by 30 - a team so bad they are on pace to hit 50 losses before league leader San Antonio hits 50 wins (and also set the standard for futility with a -10.7 point differential, all in the 4th/overtime. This could've easily been a 4-0 week for Utah and I think it will turn out to be the week that breaks their playoff chances.

**Player of the Week**: Lets give it to Enes Kanter. With Jefferson and Millsap in and out of the lineup, who started against Charlotte and Milwaukee and scored 0 points against both, then came off the bench vs the cavs to drop another 0 points... and was then given a DNP vs chicago.

**Daily Update** : Another expected loss - looks like Utah emptied their bench early after getting blown out in the first half

**Complete** : GSW(W-W), ATL(L-L) | CHA(W-W), @MIL(L-W), @CLE(L-L), @CHI(L-L) | @NYK(L-L), DET(W-W), @OKC(L-L)

**Houston Rockets predicted finish** : 15-12 to finish 44-38

**Actual Finish (So far)** : 6-4

**+/- Against predicted pace** : -1

**Games Ahead of Lakers** : 1.5 (3.5 before ASG)

**Schedule Strength** : 8 of 19 games against playoff teams
against trash and 4 against mid-range teams. 12 of 19 at home

**Analysis** : Well, they still have a very solid chance of going 12-7, keeping themselves well out of range of LA. This week opens with a breezey back to back against phoenix and then Minnesota. At the end of the week things start to get interesting as they face rivals GSW and UTA in consecutive games. Next week if the only really tough stretch for Houston. By the end of that week, Houston will have either collapsed or be completely out of reach for LA.

**Weekly Update**: Houston once again was the only team to keep pace with LA. They won all the games they had to win, provided it can assert it's dominance over Utah and Golden State late next week, games that will put them permanently ahead in the standings and seal the tie breakers.

**Player of the Week**: I'm going to give it to Chandler Parsons

**Daily Update** : So they beat Phoenix at home - who cares, and if they slip up at all, they're in trouble. They had their way in this one though - all starters in double figures and over +20 and most of them got to rest after 26-28 minutes of play time. That's okay phoenix, you already did more than we expected of you. And they STILL have two more games against each other.

**Complete** : OKC(W-L), MIL(L-W) | @ORL(W-W), DAL(W-W), @DAL(L-L), @GSW(W-W) |@PHX(L-W), PHX(W-W)

**Incomplete** :MIN(X-W), CLE(X-W), SAS(X-L), IND(X-L), @MEM(X-L), LAC(X-L), ORL(X-W), @POR(X-L), SAC(X-W)

*Dave McMenamin was saying this is the best two-game stretch of Blake's career.*  I might have to agree. He's had *nine* three-pointers in the past two games. Certainly some of his best performances in a Laker uniform. He's playing with a ton of confidence

**Steve Blake:** 16 pts (6-11 fg, 8 assists.

**Antawn Jamison:** 27 pts (8-14 fg, 1 assist.

Amazing bench performance; 43 points between the two of them.  35 minutes each

I'm not sure what's up with Pau or how soon he'll be back, but key players certainly stepped up tonight in a big way.

-Despite it being Warriors' arena

-Seeing Kobe move the way he did was extremely impressive in person. Compared to anyone else on the floor except for maybe one or two of Metta's spin moves

-The alley-oop from Nash to Kobe completely transformed the energy of the crowd. For awhile it felt like the Lakers were going to turn in another disappointment

-Steve Nash when he was on the bench was the first out there on the floor beside Sacre to greet and high five his teammates during a timeout. It's great seeing him be such a leader to the team.

-Chris Duhon

-I dont care who the starting lineup is or who D'Antoni's experimental rotations are gonna be, Pau, Nash and Metta walking out on the floor at the start of overtime -- you could just sense the fiery and wrath they were about to unleash. For those few minutes at the end, after being so disappointed in every game this season...you could see the glimmer of potential that everyone thought they would be. It was really like that shot in the Avengers where the camera swirls around the team united.

If you didn't get to watch the memorial today
  
I think it really struck me after Kobe went up to speak. Now

&gt;When I think of a player like Kobe or Magic, their personas and celebrity-status off the court. I think of how intelligently Kobe speaks and how he multi-culturally represents my generation (that of the global era). I think of how magnanimous Magic's star power was. I always liken the Lakers to a Hollywood movie, partly because of the nature of living amongst the glamour and drama of tinseltown. We've had so many storybook moments(amazing plays, clutch shots, overcoming deficits) in our history and because we do it in such a stylized and high-profile fashion, we transcend the world of sports and stats sheets. It becomes something more. The players are full-fleshed characters in the best film/book ever written for the sports world. The saga continues every season. We are so blessed to have life-long Laker legends like Kobe and Magic. The Lakers have written them a glorious story.


That being said, is not an inherent property. It is created. Jerry Buss created that environment. He turned this franchise into a phenomenon, a spectacle, a point of pride and admiration. This team feels like it's almost family to so many of us because that is the nature of how Jerry Buss operated: he always kept this little project of his in the family, and the city and its fans were that family.  


&gt;We all know of the valuable lessons that sports can teach us. They promote optimism and competition. They encourage diligence and hard work. They represent man's most ideological and sought-after desire: to attain the highest form of greatness and excellence. The will to constantly improve, and chasing greatness is represented on the surface by championships. Because of how successful we've been, the Lakers embody this not just in a season, but as an identity every season


In this time of loss and death, or a season. They are playing for an idea. They are playing for the dream, and Jerry enabled this in every minute of his history with the Lakers because he himself was the grandest of dreamers. No, the Lakers are not a force of nature in the NBA because they are simply the Lakers. They are so successful because of what we have witnessed: the manifestation of one man's dream for a sports franchise that transformed into something much more. The Lakers are a testament to great thinkers thinking with philosophical implications; They were led by a man who chased an ideology of creating material things out of immaterial ones. He blazed his own trail and produced value for things that didn't yet exist. The Lakers represent the purest of excellence in this game, and that is because they play not just for the game, but for Jerry's ideology and worldview. It has nothing to do with the LA market. Sure, it makes things easier to have a large *potential* market, Mitch

I've thought about how I would feel after Kobe retires and how the team would never feel the same again. I fell in love with the Lakers as a little kid in '96, now I've realized just what the Lakers have done for Magic and Kobe and the others. They are not great players who happened to be successful on the Lakers. The Lakers are what gave them success, and the organization has written a glorious story for all of them. Obviously players come first and are the most important facet of the sport, but to truly be great, you must have much more support than that. The Lakers don't just win because they are good. They win because, top to bottom, from the Forum/Staples Center janitors to the owner, I don't see how he could leave this team after hearing what he heard and saw today. This transcends basketball. There really is nothing else like this franchise. You have the unique opportunity to play for something truly great

&gt;Nowadays, the personalities, the inspiration. We all have our intimate relationships with our teams. I really believe that the state of this sport today, an ooh and awe spectacle of human ability, would not have been possible without Jerry Buss' influence. He was the embodiment of success, and the Lakers are who they are because they played for that man. What an utter joy it is to be a Laker, and for us


Long live Jerry Buss, and prosperity to the Los Angeles Lakers.",,False,,t5_2qhv6,1361588535.0,,

but this one play for some reason has been burned into my memory because to me it sums up who kobe is. even though he was stuck in what he may have thought was a miserable situation playing for an organization that he might have felt lied to him and betrayed him he still had the passion for the game.....the fire and desire(heh) to win no matter what. 

i'm surprised there is a clip of this play on youtube because its such a small play in a game that didnt mean much but i searched 2007 pistons lakers and there it was. kind of feel like i hit a jackpot or something. its just a small clip of kobe forcing a jump ball but his reaction is what makes it memorable.

""Recap of Dr. Robert Klapper on 08/11/12 710's Weekend Warriors program &amp; chief of orthopedic surgery at Cedar Sinai.

Some highlights: 

1. From an orthopedic surgery standpoint he would much rather have Dwight's back than Andrew's knees. 

2. The knees have a much more ""chronic injury"" issue than Dwight's back which is an ""acute injury"" that can be repaired with very little sequelae. 

3. After surgery

Why? 

Because the injury is a disc herniation: a small amount of the nucleus pulposus or the ""shock absorber"" of the disc got squeezed out. It is a VERY SMALL amount. You get rid of the ""squirted out"" material with a 1 inch incision under a microscope. 

There is a 5-10 percent chance that returning to physical activity too early could herniate more material. That's obviously not good because you've reherniated the disc and have to remove more of the extruded disc. 

Bear in mind that Dwight was fully recovered

But he is Dwight Howard and so they are being super

4. He had surgery 04/20/2012 which means he should be able to resume training, etc around 08/20/2012 if everything goes according to schedule and he feels no pain, etc. 

5. Per Dr. Klapper

6. Dwight will ALWAYS know he had surgery, etc.""

This was the first year of the past 14 years of my life that I was not able to attend a Lakers game. Due to the ridiculous prices and the Clippers playing out of their minds

So it got me wondering. What if we organized some sort of event when we can all attend a game? Perhaps we can buy a bundle of tickets for some good seats at a reasonable price? 

Maybe we can also organize something for an exhibition game as well since those are much cheaper.

If we can get enough interest maybe we sort something out. I think it would be awesome if we all pre-game together and watch a game.

Edit: we just might have something here guys. If you guys are interested

EDIT 2 (9:08 PST): Alright guys. It seems like getting a skybox would make most people satisfied. I have never been in a skybox myself so I'm even more excited. 

If there are some of you who has some sort of ""hook-up"" and won't mind collaborating with me

IF YOU ARE INTERESTED, we could probably attend more than just one game.  ALSO, if you guys can let me know how much you are willing to spend, we can see what seats or skybox would fit us best for the price.

I'm going to consider Utah *and GSW* as our playoff contenders and consider the possibilities for 7th seed.

Criteria: Clear favorite (6.5 points+), Slight underdog (-3 to -6), Clear underdog (-6.5-)

-----

Clear favorite: vs SAC, vs NOH, vs WAS (5)

Slight favorite: @MIN, vs GSW, vs HOU (5)

Close game: @GSW

Slight underdog: vs MEM

Clear underdog: @IND

-----

I'm estimating we win 75% of our ""Clear Favorite"" games, 33.3% of our ""Slight underdog"" games and just 25% of our ""Clear underdog"" games.

As of right now we projected at **9.83** wins. Which rounds up to 10

Due to Utah's recent slump, a good rule of thumb is that for every game we lose, we ought to win one. We really need to fuck up big time to miss the playoffs at this point. If we win all our Clear favorite and slight favorite games we'd have 10 wins... so even if we lose against every time we are evenly matched against or underdogs... we are still on pace to make the playoffs - in fact, possibly with a even breathing room.

The more interesting consideration is what we'd have to do to get 7th seed. Lets look at the tie breaking situation, frankly, very lucky to be where they are. They have a -0.78 win margin... meaning if you tallied the total points the score against all teams and compared it to the total points their opponents score they'd be losing by 40. In fact, both utah and us have higher win margins that GSW. More than likely, we'll own the tie breaker, whereas they only way they could take it is if they went 2-0 against us and had a better division record. Right now they are leading 7-5 to 5-5, if they 2-0 us they'd be 9-5 and we'd be 5-7... it'd be very unlikely for us to own the tie breaker if we got 2-0'd. Even if we are ""evenly matched"" against them.. they'd only have 25% chance of winning the tie breaker.

Assuming we own the tie breaker, we'd likely get the 7th seed.

-----

**Looking forward to next week:** @ORL, vsSAC. This is our toughest stretch of 4 weeks left and we projected to exactly 2-2. Two horribad teams and two very strong teams @ their place. Going 2-2, will allow us to maintain our projected 1 game lead on Utah (which would be 2 games ahead, cause they own the tie breaker), but if we manage a 3-1.. we'd be projected at 10.83 wins, which would put us on pace for the 7th seed. However, a 1-3 finish would project us at 9.83 wins... just barely ahead of Utah. A 0-4 finish would make us the projected 9th seed.

The game that is most crucial is tomorrow's game @ORL. While we should win easily

I'm going to update my projections and still make the assumption that Utah is our competitor.

Criteria: Clear favorite (6.5 points+), Slight underdog (-3 to -6), Clear underdog (-6.5-)

-----
Clear favorite: vs TOR, @ORL, vs NOH, vs WAS (6)

Slight favorite: @NOH (b2b), @PHX (b2b), vs GSW, vs HOU (6)

Close game: vs CHI

Slight underdog: vs MEM

Clear underdog: @OKC, @LAC (4)


-----

I'm estimating we win 75% of our ""Clear Favorite"" games, 33.3% of our ""Slight underdog"" games and just 25% of our ""Clear underdog"" games.

The math works out nicely, unfortunately, they own the tie breaker. Hollinger, too, projects us at 12-10, as seen here: http://espn.go.com/nba/hollinger/playoffodds

-----

They key to the playoffs is the same

Hell, I wouldn't be surprised if he basically single-handedly gets us a few.

Of course all this depends on us actually beating the teams we ought to beat.

A good rule of thumb for the remainder of the season is that for every  loss to a team we should beat is another win we need against teams at or above our level. (This is due to being in the convenient position of having exactly 12 teams we are ""favored"" against)

Right now the amount of teams at or above our level we have to beat to make the playoffs is ONE. How much (or if at all) the number increases

-----

Looking Forward to next week: @OKC, vsCHI. We are projected at 2.17 wins meaning if we split the next two games, it would put us slightly behind our projection and if Utah keeps with Hollinger's projections, it will put us in a worse position than we are now. However, if we go **3-1** this week, we would actually be the favorites to get the 8th seed. We would be project to get 12.83 wins, which rounds to the crucial 13 we would likely need for the 8th seed.

Moreover, which should make us the favorite to get the 8th seed immediately! Even if we do lose tomorrow, we could still become favorites by the end of the week if we finish 3-0.

-----

The X-Factor: Our last two games are at home against SAS and HOU. SAS is projected to have a 71.4% of getting the 1st seed. If they have a substantially enough lead on OKC, would cause them to limit their stars' minutes, giving us a ""clear favorite"" game in the comfort of the Staples Center.

-----
NOTE: I'm am using what I think Vegas will project these odds and then giving the other team 2 points. The reason for this is that Vegas has historically (over almost the last 20 years) overestimated the Lakers. This is because the public loves the Lakers and we are consistently overvalued (not saying we are overrated, you'd actually turn a profit. Same if you bet every game for the Spurs (consistently underrated by public). And, yes, people still do this. Normally, you'd just subtract 1 or 1/2 a point, but this year we've been particularly overhyped - even for a Lakers team. (we are 24-36 ATS) If you bet every game against the lakers this year you'd easily be in the top .1% of cappers.

1355149979.0,14ls8x,Are the Lakers really that bad? - ESPN Insider (text inside),RanByMyGun,42,6,11,"Nothing has gone according to plan for the Lakers, their seventh attempt at getting back to .500.

This game was supposed to be a showdown of two Western Conference heavyweights, and Dwight Howard hasn't looked anything like the defensive dominator he was in Orlando.

And yet, but this poor result has been driven as much by luck as skill. The Lakers are just 1-9 in games decided by 10 points or fewer, and have gone 8-1 in the others. They beat Denver by 19, Golden State by 24 and Houston by 11. They've outscored opponents by 4.1 points per game, the sixth-best figure in the league, and are in the league's top eight teams in both Offensive and Defensive Efficiency -- only the Clippers and Spurs can make a similar boast.

Those marks will go down once the Lakers start playing more road games against difficult teams -- like tonight's contest, it doesn't sound like a team on the brink of collapse.

L.A. also has had some notable defensive woes late in games, but they're 25th in the last five minutes of close games, according to NBA.com. This is a 21-minute sample, so we probably shouldn't obsess over it, but it does help explain why they've fallen short in most of their close games.

Nonetheless, the instantaneous coaching change, and the fact that Howard is still recovering from offseason back surgery.

Sum all that up, this one was thrown together with star talent that needs to figure out how to play together. And like that club, this one gets virtually nothing from the supporting cast.

That Heat team, had lost a home game decisively to Indiana, and had vultures circling at about this same point. Miami went 62-20 in the regular season, only falling in the Finals to Dallas.

Of course

But that also takes us to the key problem regarding the Lakers

No

I find this amazing. The Lakers have a $100 million payroll, could build a pretty decent team if they could outspend everyone else, if they were one of the top destinations for every single free agent, and if they could still ride the coattails of one spectacularly good 1996 acquisition.

Yet we're headed for a second straight season of near-total worthlessness from the second unit, Antawn Jamison and Chris Duhon) is minus-37 in 46 minutes. Subtract Jamison and they're even worse: minus-50 in 58 minutes. Small samples, yes, but frightening all the same.

This obviously coincides more or less with the ""take-under"" of the Lakers' front office by Jim Buss

When it really came down to the challenging decisions of building out the roster

First of all, they let a better player leave (Jordan Farmar) in order to do it. And third, Steve Blake? Seriously? He was 29 years old, had never posted a league-average PER, and wasn't any kind of defensive ace. In three years in L.A., he's been in single digits the entire time and is now out injured.

Look around at other spots on the roster and you'll see a similar story. Meeks? He's there because they let Shannon Brown walk

And let's not forget the ones who already came and left. I'd say the Josh McRoberts free-agent splurge was a wee bit disappointing. The Troy Murphy Era was a hoot

Of course, and not all of their gambles work out. Still, we've seen lots of teams with better hit rates than the Lakers. Atlanta, for instance, last season had players 7 through 12 on the roster all making the minimum salary, yet had one of the league's more productive second units. Somehow, the Lakers can only dream of such things.

Still, but they've also shed so many draft picks in salary dumps, cash grabs and quick fixes that they haven't selected in the first round since 2006.

The 2009 draft was a good example -- they picked 29th and in a deep draft had several potentially helpful players available to them: Toney Douglas, Sam Young, Jonas Jerebko, Danny Green, Marcus Thornton, Patty Mills and DeJuan Blair all were picked 29th or later that year.

L.A. didn't take any of them. They traded the pick to the Knicks for cash -- The Lakers! Trading for cash! -- and a 2011 second-rounder that became Andrew Goudelock

Their other second-rounder in 2011 was Darius Morris

All of which raises the question: Why don't the Lakers have good players on minimum or low-cost deals like everyone else? Jamison has been helpful offensively, Leandro Barbosa, Sam Young and Ronnie Brewer -- signed for the minimum, and a great many others signed for just a bit more. The Lakers, meanwhile, kept $1.5 million of midlevel exception money in their pocket after signing Meeks and called it a summer.

Any of these decisions might be defended individually, defending in crunch time, etc. -- but the biggest one is that the front office just hasn't given the key players enough help.

In the long run, Howard and Gasol will figure out how to play off each other, and the weakness of the supporting cast will be a distant memory if the four stars can play 35 to 40 minutes a night in the playoffs.

But this rocky start isn't a total accident. The Lakers' inability to build a decent supporting cast for their star-studded core left them open to struggles like these,False,,t5_2qhv6,False,,1960,t3_14ls8x

What he **HASN'T** actually handled well is the actual **COACHING** of the team.  From disrespecting and undervaluing Pau (who was playing hurt), to taking public knocks at his players, Mike D'Antoni has consistently proven he's not the right guy for the job.  Look at how ecstatic we were to just squeak into the playoffs.  We finished a ""monster"" 8 games above .500.  Wow.  While I think Phil Jackson was the right choice before (although who knows if Phil would've even taken the job on no training camp), I'm pretty sure that bridge is burned (thanks Jimmy).

Houston, and GSW certainly will. Now, the Lakers have had some success against GSW in the past, but got trounced the last time they played. 

And let's not forget we have a very difficult time winning in Portland. Utah plays a MIN team that gave up a long time ago twice. If they win both of those games
