C.S. Friedman is a well known author that writes epic science fiction and fantasy novels which feature complex interweavings of plot and richly detailed settings. To date she has published eight novels, Friedman began her publishing career in 1986, and quit costuming in 1996 to write full-time. She was nominated for the John Campbell award in 1986, and her novel This Alien Shore was a New York Times Notable Book of the Year.

Though her books often center on traditional fantasy themes like magic, Friedman prides herself on providing the kind of detail and consistency that makes the imaginary seem real. She rejects traditional Fantasy's clearly delineated dichotomy between good and evil, preferring to explore the uncertain and often uncomfortable grey zone between the two. Her work is often dark, and some of her most compelling characters are also her most disturbing.

Friedman's newest works include the novel Legacy of Kings  and Dominion

Lets give C.S. a very warm welcome. Post your questions here and she will be here this evening at 7pm central to answer them.",self,t5_2s92h,1338480686.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy_Bookclub/comments/ue0ti/ask_your_questions_here_for_cs_friedman/

I try to support indie writers and buy a lot of self-published stuff.  I know I'm totally biased, etc. and it really does show.  It's a good book.

The problem is just trying to get folks to read it.  Those who have read it and given feedback have all been quite positive

My wife is pretty shy about self-promotion

I've tried blog posts, contests, etc., but so far not much traction.

I've sent copies to several reviewers and am still waiting on most of them to  read it (they all say they have tons of books to read so long wait times).  One reviewer actually gave it to her teenage daughter to read it and she said she ""loved it""

Anyway, etc. is all new to me with a sort of steep and confusing learning curve, and I'm quickly learning that I'm a bit out of my depth. 

Will you kind folks please take a look at it on Amazon and give some feedback.  Is the cover art okay?  Is the book description lacking something? etc.

Should she do an AMA on reddit?  Other suggestions? (I think she and I are both socially awkward penguins

I've got the price set low right now

Anyway

1372021700.0,1gxf4e,Discussion about magic and fantasy worlds,,25,6,8,"There are so many wonderful worlds with their own rules

That being said I think there are worlds or stories where the way in which magic and the world in general works is memorable. If you can list one someone else hasn't mentioned or properly described
Of course some series like The First Law Trilogy, Assassin's Apprentice are intentionally vague and you never quite learn the way in which magic works, nor do you need to, this is where we list stuff like Brandon Sanderson's worlds for example.

Ok so after this retarded explanation of what I'm trying to get going here I'll post a few. Why
For example

**Harry Potter** - wizards have the ability to do magic, speaking to serpents for example.

Brandon Sanderson

**Elantris** - not an incredibly detailed magic system as it's been something forgotten from the past, even in air, the spell is activated or can be triggered by touch

**Warbreaker** - one of the most interesting magic systems that I've read about- In this world every ordinary human has one unit of magic, with magic that is basically described as color. People who accumulate enough of these souls become stronger and stronger and can do more and more amazing things.

**Stormlight Archives (Way of Kings)** - Still plenty about how the world works is to be discovered, shift gravity around themselves, basic but very creative for the action that occurs. There are also crystals and forgotten technologies that enable transmutation of materials, certain swords can be summoned from thin air in a matter of heartbeats, and there is a type of power armor, remnants of past ages.

**Mistborn**, they can become physically strong, and more, all of which involve a distinct metal or alloy. Here particularly in the alloy of law you get more interesting powers from this magic system, including bending time and self healing. It makes for very interesting non-metal weapons that try to nullify this advantage of Allomancers etc.

Ok so much for the Sanderson books.

**Farseer Trilogy**, or creatures, and they are very rare in the world. Inanimate objects can be given life, such as with the Liveships in the liveship traders trilogy. Because magic is so sparse it's almost not worth mentioning here but I think people looking for fantasy with more subtle magic elements will be drawn to these character focused series

**Wheel of Time** by R. Jordan - Women and men use complementary parts of the world's magic, others be chosen by fate itself, thus their actions directly affect the fate of the world, what they do matters in the big picture, and it's up to them to change what's inevitable. This is just briefly explaining or giving a few examples of what is possible, it is another world where the magic is complex but detailed, and not all aspects of it are revealed on purpose by the author.

**Abhorsen Trilogy** by Garth Nix - While there are typical magical users the series focuses on the individual known as the Abhorsen. He is an anti-summoner that can send back undead into death using seven magical bells. Of course this implies that the world also has necromancy around. Also mentioned is the posibility to inscribe weapons for example with words that are effective against undead

**Black Company Chronicles** While not having a detailed magic system, spells of destruction are mentioned. One particular thing about the ones that are generally described as powerful sorcerers is that they're a bitch to kill, there are literaly scenes where they're getting torn to shreds and they won't die, even decapitation or impaling them won't make some die. If they can't talk or move their fingers, usually the sorcerers will be unable to cast spells, with a few exceptions. Sorcerers tend to not trust each other and everyone has their own tricks up their sleeves. Powerful magic like the one in this world makes for very amazing battles but it's not over the top or a cop out as it could very easily become, probably why this series is so widely praised.

Also it does not have to be formal schooling. I think that Night Angel trilogy or The Farseer trilogy molded the young people into characters I personally fell in love with. I love the stories where the character learns a wide variety of skills, as long as its not the center of the whole story.

1365150358.0,1bq0k7,I just read an excellent fantasy trilogy called the “Legends of Muirwood” by Jeff Wheeler.,TomTheNurse,22,5,20,"http://www.amazon.com/Jeff-Wheeler/e/B004SBCEK6/ref=ntt_athr_dp_pel_pop_1/176-5912583-2957904

I was browsing the Amazon fantasy section on my Kindle recently and I came across the “Legends of Muirwood” trilogy by Jeff Wheeler.  What caught my eye is that it had well over 200 reviews and they collectively gave it an over four star average rating.  I read the synopsis, for the series was worth a shot.  

I am glad I did.  It is not the next “Lord of the Rings”, a bit of a love story, classic good verses evil and such.   

Things I enjoyed about it were the main character was really likeable and the author allowed her to develop and bloom as the story progressed.  I loved the pacing.  There were not 100’s of leagues to be traveled between events so the plot was able to unfold fairly rapidly.  The story was focused almost entirely on one character so there was very little jumping around from character to another.  The story was presented on an almost linear timeline meaning that there was very little jumping backwards and forwards along the plot time line.  Some of the ancillary and supporting characters were delightfully unpredictable.  Just when you thought they were bad

My minor knocks on it were that it was a little hard to get into initially but once it got going, predictability kind of comes with the territory.  

Overall

I just really really wanted to **THANKS** to all of you who helped and everyone else too just for being a part of this glorious community. 

I'm almost finished reading the Amber Chronicles by Roger Zelazny

I wanted also to bring up the fact I said about the ""non traditional fantasy"" (with a lot of murders
&gt;Looking for fantasy novels where good / bad isn't always apparent and even in bad there is something good and vice versa.

In russian descriptions to both ASOIAF &amp; The Witcher book series it is said that the books are ""straying away from traditional fantasy"". People have pointed out that 
&gt;every author that isn't crap or from 10 years ago writes like this

Well it turned out not to be entirely true. ""Black and white"" or ""traditional fantasy"" is still being written, though not yet becoming in itself a standard. What I didn't know is just how many authors are ""straying"" (turns out A LOT!!). The best part about all this research - I found that there is a special ""series"" (don't know what the proper term or word would be for it) published by one of the publishers called ""Черная Фэнтези"" literal translation being ""Black (dark) Fantasy"" and they publish all those awesome authors that I was looking for!! - Joe Abercrombie, Glenn Cook, Robert Asprin, Richard Morgan and others! IT'S SO FREAKIN AWESOME!!! 

There is a downside to it too - the series is extremely popular among russian fantasy readers but not among general population (like song of ice and fire is for instance) so the books that are published - are being bought out super fast. I ordered all of the books from russia

Phew

Ok so here goes:

My best friend, writing bits and pieces of it since as far back as highschool (we're in our late 20s now).  Well, he finally released a hardcover copy of it (printed on double sided 8.5/11, the thing weighed a ton!) a couple of years ago and pretty much invested his life savings into it.  

As you can imagine, AZ and at the first friday artwalks that summer.  Unfortunately the winter in Flag that year was the worst of the past 40+, causing the roof to collapse (quite literally) on The Hastings store, and obliterating almost all of his stock.  Being the proud guy that he is, he just kind of accepted that loss.  After that he had to put The Golden Book on the back burner as he discovered he was going to become a father shortly thereafter.  

I don't want to get too personal, though.

So out of the blue yesterday he sends me a link to a trailer on youtube for The Golden Book and a url showing that I could download it at Barnes and Noble or Smashwords!!!  So cool that he's revisiting the book and with the help of the internet/e-readers he can actually sell it and maybe recoup a few bucks that he's invested into it.  I don't know if this is the right subreddit to be posting all of this

He's selling the book for $0.99 and if you're fans of fantasy and/or for helping out budding authors

Not too long ago I came across a used book store and found [these](http://i.imgur.com/SyHvKsN.jpg) two gems (among other things).

These 2 books contain the first 4 novels by Steve Perry - Earth Hive, Genocide.

Finally I picked up the first one (got so many unread books right now...) and wanted to share my thoughts with you. These are pretty damn good! 

The books pick up right after Aliens. First one was written in 1992, and further Alien movies and Alien novels are two different roads.

It doesn't feature any of the original characters, but it's not the focus, and the human emotions are there but they're also not the focus, the focus is the action. I'm just about finished with the 2nd novel, and the if I was happy with the 1st, the 2nd is a bit formulaic (new crazy general as the enemy, people trying to tame aliens rather than destroying them etc) but none the less it's still super readable. Not boring at all. 

Also I must mention the writing style. It's very uhm... I don't know the proper term or word for this. It's basically like a movie, then shifts to action, shows good guys reaction, shows bad guys reaction, a few hits, then shows generals again etc... It's been done in many books, I know, it's even specially separated like that

1327523692.0,owim7,Just read Shadow and Claw by Gene Wolfe. Having a hard time understanding why it is rated so high. [SPOILERS],Asian_Persuasion,13,2,18,"I just want another person's perspective here as to why it is so highly rated as a fantasy book. Here's my take on it:

The whole plot seemed very flimsy to me. I can barely piece together any kind of semblance of a story. Everything that happened to him seems only marginally related to the actual journey Severian is taking. The talk with the green man seemed to serve nothing but give a little philosophical and as a tool to move the story forward. Then there are the mirrors in the story that seem to do nothing but show the fact that interplanetary travel is possible using them. What I mean to say is that Wolfe seems to just write these elements with no relation to one another.

For instance, are an ancient race that are somehow going to die with some kind of coming apocalypse. This is just my take based on what was said when the giant lady in the Gyoll tries to take him near the end of the book in addition to what happened in the play in the House Absolute. This is in the hopes that the play actually had some kind of significance to the story and was not just a waste of space. After having figured that out, despite probably being wrong, I still do not see any actual relation between the giants and Severian. I want to assume that Severian is important because that giant lady wants him, but other than that one part there seems to be no relation between Severian and the giants.

There also seems to be no fleshing out of anything besides Severian in here. I want to say that is understandable seeing as this is an autobiography, at least to me, an important part of the story. Nearly nothing is known about Father Inire and the Autarch himself. Severian also, strangely, does not seem interested in the fact that the Autarch and Vodalus are not only cooperating, but are answering to a higher power. Then the Claw isn't really discussed and is only used as a method of healing.

My point is, plot elements with no history or backstory behind anything. I'll take any ideas on this and/or criticisms of my analysis.

**EDIT: All I am asking for is what you personally got from the story that I seem to have missed. Examples of some subtle symbolisms that seem to draw the story together or give some of the side elements some backstory. I already understand there are more books,,False,self,t5_2s92h,True,,True

I'm basically looking for good modern fantasy novels to read. To help pinpoint the suggestions (because there are obviously thousands of fantasy novels)

1) So far I've finished the Harry Potter books (I know that's obvious but I'm not sure if it fits in fantasy), as well as A Game of Thrones (everyone is telling me to read it). I also recently read The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern which was fantasic. Not sure if it fits in traditional fantasy but books similar to that would be awesome

2) I like novels that have some sort of ""magic""-fantasy to them. Magic doesn't necessarily need to take the central role

3) I HIGHLY prefer series over standalone novels

4) I don't mind reading novels aimed at any age - that includes youth-literature

5) I also do enjoy horror-fantasy as well

What I'm looking for in a beta-reader:

* Someone who isn't afraid to voice their opinion. (Obviously)
* Honesty. I want to hear the truth and nothing but the truth. I'd much rather have you hurt my feelings and NOT publish a bad piece of work rather than you sparing my feelings and embarrassing me to my readers. (A writer more than often misses obvious flaws in his works that others catch.) 
* Someone who can provide ""constructive"" criticism. I can't stress this enough. As much as I want honesty

I'm very open-minded and open to criticism so I can handle whatever you throw at me.

Can't really think of anything else at this point. If you're interested in providing your assistance then I'll gladly have you on-board. Every beta-reader will be given access to the beta-reader forum to provide reviews

I was picking up ""Mask of Cthulhu"" in the book store (my local network of bookstores has a website where you can order a book and have it delivered to a specific shop free of charge) and the overly attached book store clerk started hitting me with recommendations, and wasn't trying to *just sell* me more books. However I already have quite a backlog of unread stuff so I was like ""nah man, nooo, nah, no, maybe next time"" but he kept insisting, so I picked the cheapest book he was offering,38$). 

Since it's rather not large I decided - might aswell read it and get it out of the way - HOLY FAKE TITS ON A ZOMBIE fellow readers! This book is fucking amazing!

It started off a bit slow (and I gotta say I'm not the biggest fan of the whole treasure hunting / indiana jones archaeology) but when the characters were set and the actual ""action"" started - the mystery actually became interesting! I swear here I am not caring about who this found dead guy is and 50 something pages later ""OMG! Who is he?!! WHY WAS HE THERE? I MUST KNOW!!"" 

I read about 1/3 of the book in one sitting (196 pages out of 540) and I guess the only thing that bothered me was - there was quite a big chunk without anything fantasy/mysticism related


If you're looking for a great adventure book - this is it! I can't recommend it enough! And from now on - I'll be getting most of my books from that obsessive clerk person

Since its release years ago It has claimed the top spot on my list of fantasy book series. Without a doubt it's incredible.  Thankfully, but its really not just about that at all. All of the books feature elements that the guys will enjoy, such as thievery, wizardry and swordplay.  You'll truly be caught up within the universe. The characters are definitely the best part of the entire thing because each has an individual personality that helps affect the world.

The first book can be found here if you're interested:

I just recently finished The Witcher Saga

Wall of text on what I actually mean by that (also some background on my reading in general):

I was never much of a reader, my reading ended. 

More recently I got a hold of the first Song of Ice and Fire book

When I finished those books - I just had this huge empty space that I needed to fill with more reading. The first thought came quickly - Lord of the rings, because it was boring. Now again it may not be the books fault - just a bad translation which doesn't quite tell the story in the way author intended it, but I don't have any other options since reading in English is very difficult (I can't really explain it, more or less reading a novel is very different from say reading a forum post). 

I was browsing the local online book store when a book caught my attention - a 7 in 1 all books about The Witcher

**The Witcher**
It's setting is pretty close to what song of ice and fire is, because there is one main character) a lot of very detailed violence, sex scenes (not as detailed :( ), there is a great war that is tearing apart the kingdoms both with the aggressor and amidst themselves, but the main and the MOST important thing - there is practically no good and evil. I mean sure there is a lot of evil, and there are a lot of people who are trying to do good, but the evil characters are not exclusively evil (or their plans are not always ultimately evil) and good characters a lot of times have bad sides to them. I mean - it's not always US vs. THEM (and who are WE and who are THEY is not always apparent) there is no black and white in characters, nowhere near as good as GRRM) it's very much like (how I think) it was in the middle ages - people were just trying to survive


Phew... are you still with me? :) 

So I was wondering if this kind community could recommend to me something to read

**TL;DR**

Looking for fantasy novels where good / bad isn't always apparent and even in bad there is something good and vice versa.

I read this fantasy book when I was in middle school (eight years ago) I don't remember all of it but I remember one key part and the beginning and the ending I hope this will help.

The beginning started out with a teenager wanting to contact his friend with his mind to tell his house but knew that his friend could not respond in the same way because (Not because he did not possess magical abilities) but because that was not one of his powers.

When they meet at the teenagers house

One important part I remember is this woman explaining that some people can use magic

Now the ENDING I remember.

Remember the teenagers friend I spoke about earlier?  Well his magic power is to trade his body for his friends when they were dead and at the end of the book the teenager's friend trades his life for the life of his four friends when they were on the verge of death.

It's odd having all this ahead of me because every now and again I'll hear of certain things that sound cool like the Gap Cycle or the Night's Dawn trilogy, Book of the New Sun, The Chronicles of Amber or Belgeriad, and choosing to add even a few of these to a committed list of books to read that list has easily grown past *one hundred books*.

And then there's also Neal Stephenson, the Dune series, and an assortment of historical fiction books like Pillars of the Earth or The Far Pavillions, or those from Gary Jennings or James Clavell.

And on top of that The Amber Spyglass has been left unfinished for a few years now.

Do you read one book

Or do you read the parts of the series consecutively ? 

In my case, but when I read the second one some months later, I really couldn't get in to it since I had forgotten who was who and what had happened to them/ what they were doing.

After quite a big break from reading ( simply because other things took place) I'm now 100% in the mood (and got the time) to get back to some awesome time sitting relaxed in my bed and reading a great fantasy novel!
I would really like some suggestions though!

Here are some books I've read and enjoyed:

Harry Potter series: I've read them quite a long time ago, and I really don't like this sort of thing.

A Song of Ice and Fire: I only read the first 3 books, it just drags a bit to much in some places, so I will definitely get back to it, but not now. What I liked the most about these books were the characters and the way the fantasy aspect was handled. It played allot with dark magic, and it was something very controlled and there seems to be some limits about it, which I think it's awesome and makes it more mystical and frightning

His Dark Materials: I'm just finishing the last book of this now. I'm really divided on this one. I think that there is allot of heart on these books and I love many of the ideas and characters, and I think that the whole mystery of Dust was also really nice, but I feel like things just got out of control when Angels and all that sort of thing came into place out of nowhere, it just felt so off at the time...just didn't seem to fit, in my opinion. 
At some points the books also seemed a bit childish for me ( I'm 22 ). I don't mind young protagonists

Chronicles of Conan ~- I've read many of the short stories and I loved them. I really like dark fantasy and Conan has allot of it :). The only problem is that I don't really like short stories

I've also read the first book in the sci-fi Hyperion series and loved it

So if you guys could give me any recommendations it would be great!

Thank you so much in advance!

1325774453.0,o3z5k,The Almighty Indie Spammer,RStray,2,2,5,"Hey

I'm kind of new to reddit and mainly use it for some of my gaming journalism news as I am a journalist. With the new year now having started I've been trying to find ways to promote my own fantasy book and thought of running promotions at forums where I can give away a few eBooks of my work.

But the problem with this is then I just end up being a spammer. I hate spammers myself and hate it when guys just butt in on forums with their stuff and act as if that's ok.

So I'm not going to post anything for this first post of mine - no link or anything like that. I'm just going to ask how much regulars here would welcome that sort of thing. What I'd like to do, not this one). Give away five or so. 

My book is epic fantasy and I'm getting some really great feedback from readers

Anyway, but I just don't have the kind of money required to buy and post print versions and do a full on campaign like that.
