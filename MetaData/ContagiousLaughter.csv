Here's the [traffic stats](http://imgur.com/d8lmvJj) in case ye are interested. 

While this is great to see our little subreddit grow it does of course bring it's own issues too
__________________________
* It was made as a collection of videos/audio of people laughing in a way that makes you laugh. A good rule of thumb is to start the video immediately after the ""joke"" and if it's still funny then it's /r/contagiouslaughter material. 

* [This video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeauvE1M7qc) from the Berlin U-Bahn is a perfect illustration of this subreddit - there is no ""joke"", just people laughing and it's hilarious.

* The other thing is reposts, search for keywords too as the URL may be different) and if you've seen it before **downvote** it, if it's new to you and makes you laugh **upvote**

* We would like this to be a pleasant place where people can come to turn their brains off and just laugh for a few minutes. If you think the post is *contagiously* funny then **upvote** if you don't

If you are new to the subreddit

Downvotes. This is still a fairly small subreddit(although the subscribers blew up in the past month or so). If a submission is within the rules and relevant to this subreddit and you like it

If you see something you do not think fits this subreddit, it was not for this subreddit. 

Have a look at the sidebar:


**Encouraged content:**

* Videos of people laughing infectiously

* Funny laughs that make you join in

* Videos of people chortling, tittering, howling, cackling or laughing

* [This Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeauvE1M7qc) is why this subreddit was created

If you have any questions

[Thank you](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VL_5MX7z94) for reading!

**Edit**: Thank you for upvoting this

I wanted to expand on what kind of videos are appropriate here. You ever watch a video where something funny happens(doesn't even have to be that funny) but the way the person/s in the video are laughing makes you laugh even harder? It could be nothing but it's just an infectious laugh? That is the essence of this subreddit.
