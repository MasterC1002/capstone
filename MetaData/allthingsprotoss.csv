The Fall of GosuBuilds.,NoseKnowsAll,125,14,30,"I am no longer working on GosuBuilds for reasons that I have fully outlined in an [post in the starcraft subreddit here](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/1ehep0/the_rise_of_imbabuilds_the_fall_of_gosubuilds/).

The TL;DR copied from the above link is:

I wrote almost all of the builds on GosuBuilds. Fed up with the owner of the site only wanting money and not contributing at all, a build order site I will constantly update made exclusively for the community.

Thanks /r/AllThingsProtoss for all the support and feedback you've given me in recent times.  I've taken a lot of it into consideration and I've truly tried to make this site the best I can based on you guys' comments.  Sorry for those who have checked GosuBuilds recently and not seen any updates: I don't have access anymore to the site so couldn't alert you.  And sorry for not getting this up and running faster - I was moving home from college in the past week and things have been rather hectic.  

I'll answer any questions you might have either here

I have been collaborating with the fellas over at ATT and we want to run a tournament

NA ONLY.

Yes that means you bronze silver and gold you are in the lower division. Plat and diamond are in the next and masters and GM are in the top division of the tournament.  It will be a bracket play and not an all kill play.  There will be 6 players for each division, and two gold and goes the same for the other two.  I will take a pool of the names that are put in the COMMENTS of this post and divide them up and pick them out of a hat so that there is no one sided choices for the lower two divisions.  For the masters and GM part I and our mods will hand pick them to represent us.  

When will this all happen? We plan on it being next week.  Dates are subject to change

Who will cast? We are still figuring that out. We would like to get multiple casters for the lower league games and then one big one for the masters/GM games.  This will allow people to see the entire range of our communities as far as skill goes and giving people a fun opportunity to be casted! 

Bracket system? That will be determined soon enough, it will be a Bo5.  For the masters/GM it will more than likely follow the same format, but again things are subject to change! 

What do I win? PRIDE AND HONOR FOR AIUR. In all seriousness though the winner of the bracket for each division will be getting reddit gold funded by the mods from our subs and then the overall winner of the tournament

How do I get my name in the drawing pot? COMMENT ON THE POST. As I stated above comments will get your names put in the pool and drawn! As far as the masters/GM people go

When will I find out? This week! I will leave this thread up for a few days and then look at it and put everything in for the drawings and announce it via a post and a PM! Masters/GM maaaay take a bit longer

So there ya have it! Sorry for the wall of text but it was needed! Comment

**Core build**  
9 Pylon  
13 Gate  
14 Assimilator  
16 Pylon  
18 Cybernetics Core  
19 Zealot (Naniwa cancels this zealot before it finishes so he can get his Nexus up slightly faster)  
*Cut probes at 23 supply  
*Cancel Zealot  
*Start warpgate  
21 Nexus @ 3:45  

**Variation 1** (Fake Zealot pressure into Phoenix)  
21 MSC  
*Resume probe production  
23 Zealot  
25 Pylon @Natural to wall  
27 Sentry  
30 3 Gateways + Pylon @ 5:00  
*Push out with MSC and zealot and keep the sentry at the natural  
@150 Gas Stargate @ 5:55  
*Naniwa did not spot a 3rd base a faked early aggression in this game against Jaedong so he did not warp in 4 zealots and instead recalled.  
@6:20 3 assimilators  
Phoenix(4-5) when Stargate finishes *Chronoboost  
Robo Facility and Forge after first phoenix

**Variation 2** (Zealot pressure into Phoenix or Void Ray)  
21 MSC  
*Resume probe production  
23 Zealot  
25 Pylon @Natural to wall  
27 Sentry  
30 3 Gateways  
*Push out with MSC and zealot and keep the sentry at the natural  
@150 Gas Stargate @ 5:55  
*Naniwa spotted a third base from Sortof and delayed his gasses in favor of warping in zealots  
Warp in 4 Zealots @6:30  
@6:40 Assimilator  
*If zealot aggression is working feel free to warp in another round of zealots and use time warp with the MSC
Assimilators at the natural when you have the minerals  
Phoenix(4-5) or  Void Ray(1) when Stargate finishes *Chronoboost  
Robo Facility and Forge after first phoenix  

**Variation 3** (Fast Phoenix)  
21 2nd Assimilator  
*Resume probe production  
22 MSC  
24 Pylon @Natural to wall  
26 Stargate  
27 Zealot   
30 2 Gateways to wall  
32 Sentry  
*Fake Pressure with you zealot and MSC  
36 Phoenix(4-5) when Stargate finishes *Chronoboost  
@6:30 2 assimilators  
@7:30 Add Robo Facility and Forge   

**Variation 4** (Oracle into Immortal Sentry Oracle All in)  
21 2nd Assimilator  
*Resume probe production  
22 MSC  
24 Pylon @Natural to wall  
26 Stargate  
27 Zealot *Naniwa cancels this zealot right before it finishes as well so the sentry and oracle will be started at 34 and 36 supply respectively if you didn't skip this zealot  
30 Forge and Gateway to wall  
32 Sentry  
34 Oracles(3) *Chronoboost  
@6:20 2 Assimilators  
Pressure the zerg with the oracles and MSC using time warp to pick off queens  
@7:15 Robo Facility  
@7:30 +1 Attack  
*Stop Probe production @~46  
*When Robo Finishes Chronoboost 2 immortals and a warp prism  
@9:00 Add 5 gateways  
@10:00 Move out w/ ~8 sentries and 2 immortals

**End Game Goals**
Besides Variation 4, add another 2 Stargates and begin phoenix production.  From the forge, research +1 Attack and +1 Armor, adding a twilight council which will be used to research Charge, +2 Attack and to build a templar archives.  Look to take a third base around 10:30-11:00.  Against roach hydra viper composition, use templars to attempt to feedback the vipers.  Against an ultralisk composition you want 3-4 colossus and immortals with lots of zealots and archons.  Against a muta switch, phoenix and high templars are ideal.

**Note**  
*Put your first pylon next to your nexus in case of early pools  
*This build does not scout so the first zealot is made in case of an early pool and is cancelled if there are no lings  
*Time warp is great for picking off queens off creep during your early aggression

One thing I've been playing around with is using the MSC to spot for Tempests. Tempests have 15 range but only 12 sight. The MSC's sight means that you can see to max attack range by only being a single unit in front of your Tempests. This keeps everything nice and safe while still allowing your Tempests to be obnoxious as hell.

MC's 4Gate Oracle build in PvT
_____________________________

9 Pylon

13 Gateway

2x Gas on ~15

16 Pylon

18 Cybernetics Core

Hide the next pylon in a corner of your base

Warpgate/Stalker (chronoboosted)

Mothership Core

Stalker

Stargate at hidden pylon &gt;:D

Sentry

Start chronoboosting oracles out of the stargate. After the starting the first one build a Nexus at your natural

Keep building oracles and throw down 3 more gateways as you can afford them. MC has been going up to 4 Oracles.

Now from here the idea is to have 4 Oracles and a Mothership Core harassing the main while having gateway units consisting of mostly Stalkers hit the front. Split up Terrans units. If this build is unscouted or they don't have enough turrets and Vikings you will just shit on him. If you want you can also have the gateway and stargate units together and just attack the front using Timewarp to slow the units and let the Oracles melt everything. A lot of Terrans have been opening with widow mines

__________________________________________________
MC's Gateway Pressure with MS Core
_____________________________________________

This build is pretty much a variant of the gateway pressure openings with a lot of sentries in WoL but now with a Mothership Core!

9 Pylon

13 Gateway

15 Gas

18 Cybernetics Core

18 Zealot

Warpgate Research

Chrono a stalker

Nexus

Mothership Core adding on a 2nd gas after

Sentry

Add 4 Gateways and make sure you start saturating the natural base

Start warping in sentries as soon as the Gateways are up. Also get a proxy pylon up somewhere by his base.

Attack the front with around 5 sentries, and the Mothership Core. It really helps if you try to focus the bunkers down (if he has any) while casting Timewarp on the scvs coming to repair. I apologize if I got any of this wrong, feel free to comment on anything I missed on this one, I think I got it right though. 

One more thing

Hopefully these help, but I'm pretty sure these are accurate :D

1366224405.0,1cjt9v,Timings in PvX!,WonkaKnowsBest,79,7,30,"Now I'm going to start off by saying I do not know all the timings I should being at the master level for so long

For example. 

a 6 pool will optimally go down at around 0:41. it takes the spawning pool a minute and depending on the map, seeing as lings take 30 seconds as well. 

_

(*Edit: timing*) A normal stalker will pop out around 4:15 meaning your scouting probe should leave around 4:10 if you want to keep it alive.

_


In a normal 12 rax the first marine will pop out at 3:05.

_

If you scout with stalker/zealot pressure in PvT and when you get there he has 3 marines he's doing it off 1 rax meaning it shouldn't be an all in in the immediate future. 

_

If the zerg goes a 2:05 pool (standard) into a standard expansion he will plant down the natural expansion at around 2:40. If he is going to take a gasless third it will plant down as soon as 4:15 and possibly as late as 4:45. 

_

The standard timing on a 3 base roach warren is roughly 6:30 meaning you can poke until 7:30 against only lings and queens on 3 base. 

_

The fastest a widow mine drop can hit you is roughly 7:00 (might need to check the timings on that. It's not crisp but it's around there.) With an expansion this will hit around 7:30.

_

(*Edit: timing*) The fastest an in base reaper (not proxied) can hit you is roughly 4:15 minutes if it's a standard reaper.

_

An 8-8-8 Reaper will hit your base at roughly 3:20 depending on the map.

_


Stim will finish on a standard terran at about 9:00 so be ready for a timing attack at about 9:30-10 if he's planning one.

_

The standard time for a safe oracle build to hit your mineral line is 6:45. 

_

The standard time for DT's to hit your ramp is roughly 7:05.

I can't really think of anymore crucial timings that your opponent will do. Feel free to correct any of my time if they are vastly off. Please add more timings if I missed any. 

If someone could enlighten me on the time a 1rax CC would go down and when it'd hit the natural if it was build in base. Also when a standard lair timing is

*Edit x2:* A standard 1 rax FE will have a CC down at 3:05. 3:20 if they get their 2nd depot before it. Meaning it will be done around 4:45 or 5 and if it's made in base will be down at the natural at 5:00 or 5:15.

**PvT: Huk's Warp Prism Rush**  
VOD: http://www.twitch.tv/nasltv/b/395830855?t=12h19m8s  

Intro: This game is from group stage 3

**Build Order**  
9 Pylon  
13 Gateway  
15 Assim x2  
16 Pylon  
18 Cyber Core  
23 Pylon  
100% Cyber core- WG research and Stalker - Happens at 23 supply  
27 Nexus - Goes down ~ 4:30  
27 MSC  
27 Robo (Probe production stopped here for a second)  
32 Pylon
37 Warp Prism  
40 - Proxy pylon outside of NME base - Goes down at 6:40   
49 - 2 More gateways (5 total)  

At this point, your warp prism goes into the main, unloads 4 sentries and warps in zealots. All you need are a few good FF on the ramp to the natural, and the poor Polt has nothing to defend his main.  Keep the warp prism there and warp in as your gateways come off cooldown.  

The key is the prism placement. Needs to be far enough away from the ramp that marines can't kill it, oddly enough, but before a medivac can be completed.  Should hopefully catch a terran working to drop play off guard.  

So this is my effort. Recommend edits if you'd like. And,,False,self,t5_2tkqb,1367021976.0,,True

Before hand ill give you things its weak against and things its strong against!

***Weak against:*** 

* CC first into a really early 7 barracks bio 
* Not specifically mech openers
* Mass sky terran
* Any really early upgrade play (4:30 engie bay)
   
 ***If its scouted!!!*** : 

            * 4+ bunkers and depot wall
            * A really small ramp to nat with a depot wall

***Strong against:***

* Any gas openers into hellion
* Proxy factory
* Banshees
* Any really early marine drop play
* 1rax gasless expand into 3 rax bio
* 1rax reaper expand into bio
* 3cc
* 5-7 rax before starport
* Any other werid bio plays or openers. 

So as you can see this build is very strong

&gt;Add on 3 -4 more gateways

&gt;Add on templar archive

&gt;Add on 2-3 more gateways to have a total of 9

&gt;Send probe out unless you already have one and hide it to make a pylon

&gt;Make a proxy pylon

&gt;Move out at roughly 11 minutes once you have stalkers in main to cover for drops

&gt; With 3 archons and a bunch of zealots + 3 sentrys hit right when 2/2 finishes

&gt; keep reinforcing with a heavy emphasize on archons whenever you get 300 gas. Sentrys can be good as well.

And there you have it


**Here are some side notes to keep in mind :**
&gt; Make sure you continue to produce sentrys after your +1/+1 starts until you have 3!

&gt; When one sentry has 100 energy create a hallucination phoenix to help scout out your opponent. if you see mech make a robo and take a early 3rd.

&gt; Your msc is there to save your butt

&gt; if widow mines are out of a cannons range just make more cannons

&gt; Don't move out without at least 4 stalkers in your main to defend against drops.

&gt; Make sure he does not try to base trade you.

&gt; Do not engage up the main ramp until your confident you can and you have checked the third for a expo as well as killed the naturals expo

&gt; Your scouting probe only needs to see gas and then try to hide him where terran will not scout. This helps for proxy in the future.

1364643315.0,1baqkm,Skytoss PvZ replay pack. Just hit master HoTS with 85% PvZ winrate,daren_james,57,11,47,"I've been debating for a while whether i should post some replays of my PvZ build. Some people in another thread were asking for pvz skytoss builds so here's mine. I've been doing it since WoL (where I was also master league) and haven't changed anything for HoTS.

In a nutshell, repeatedly denying your third, and picking you apart with multi-pronged harass). It takes low mechanical skill to execute but requires some good decision making. It's not a good build if you want to be a good player (i'm definitely not a good player, my pvp and pvt are atrocious) but it's fun, it works, and people have asked me to share so i'm sharing.

So

EDIT: games against masters players (all wins) are marked

http://drop.sc/315861 bel shir vestige(2): standard win. killed 3rd with void pressure pressure. tried to pressure main

http://drop.sc/315863 neo planet s le: standard win. alllmost kill the third

http://drop.sc/315856 akilon wastes(4): strange sub-optimal zerg opener into poorly executed but somewhat dangerous 3-base hydra/queen pressure. i hold and max out for the win.

http://drop.sc/315864 newkirk precinct (4): killed lair with voidray pressure. zerg goes muta ling and gets multiple waves of lings into my base

http://drop.sc/315865 whirlwind le(2): first loss. this is a good game to study; its one of the main ways i lose with this build. i do MASSIVE damage with void ray pressure, then more or less a-moves to my base for the win. i tend not to scout with this build (again, i'm not a very good player), but i should really put more effort into knowing if mutas are coming. all i needed to do was send the voids home after killing the hatch and i would have been able to defend the mutalisks.

MASTERS http://drop.sc/315866 whirlwind le(3): first game/win against master leaguer. runs first lings into my base but i defend relatively well. forces me to cancel my third with lings

http://drop.sc/315857 akilon wastes(12): second loss. i kill his 3rd with voids while he gets lings in my main. i do well enough against the lings but then he goes muta ling and i don't defend well enough. probably a bad decision to push out when i did...even if you're bleeding pretty bad its usually better to keep turtling until 3/3/3 200/200. i probably had a small chance to win if i had done that.

http://drop.sc/315858 akilon wastes(13): sloppy build execution...i push later with 5 voids due to supply block. i get aggressive (and do well) with void ray micro against hydras. opponent tries hydra pressure and leaves early when it's clear its not working and i'm way ahead.

http://drop.sc/315867 whirlwind le(4): sloppy defense vs 10 pool. opponent follows up with swarm hosts...bad idea(/luck?)

MASTERS http://drop.sc/315859 akilon wastes(15): win vs master leaguer. standard opening. zerg tries to deny third with lings but i defend with voids. i kill his third (twice! he restarts it

http://drop.sc/315860 akilon wastes(16): ahgl game vs weak (silver-ish?) zerg player. standard win. boring game.

http://drop.sc/315868 whirlwind le(7): standard win. no damage with void ray pressure. zerg forces cancel on fourth but i got it up eventually so its fine. zerg goes mutas; around 5-6 carriers i was confident i had the army advantage so i pushed out early to keep his mutas/attention on my push instead of killing probes in my base. it worked

MASTERS http://drop.sc/315862 neo planet s le(6): my account hit masters with this win. the opponent is also master level; he got his promotion in the next game or two (i checked lol). pretty standard opening/voidray pressure/macroing up. one unusual thing: i counterattacked after one of his pushes. it worked out well for me. i tend not to counter attack because i like to wait for 3/3/3 200/200 to attack usually but in this game it seemed prudent to counterattack.

So, and currently 3/0 against solid masters players (maybe a little different depending on if you count diamonds who were master WoL and haven't hit master HoTS yet). pretty good, especially for a player as shitty as me. hehe.

Now some important concepts:

--Taking a third: double stargate forces zerg to react or lose. this gives you time to take a third; its harder for zerg to deny it because they need to get spores/queens/hydras out. i typically take my third when my second pair of void rays is building. you're not totally safe but as you can see from my replays you can almost always get it up. Additionally: use your first two void rays to clear out lings/overlords for taking a third. you don't need to hide your void rays because the whole build revolves around your opponent seeing 'oh hes going stargate' and focusing on anti-air while you get a third up.

taking bases after the third: the build is gas intensive and you have a lot of minerals to spare. so it's actually worth it to just expand aggressively and unsafely (ie you know you're going to cancel if they pressure it). if you get stuck on 3 base you're in coin flip land--you won't be able to macro up another force of carriers after the initial engagement. getting a 4th (and 5th!) up does wonders for being able to remax. so be aggressive about getting it down!

max upgrades, there's just something special about 3/3/3 200/200 carriers. so a lot of my games i end up sitting around on 200/200 doing basically nothing (maybe taking another expo or making more cannons) crono'ing my last upgrades.

idk what else to say. if i think of anything i'll put it in the comments. i'd love to hear feedback.",self,t5_2tkqb,1364644050.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/allthingsprotoss/comments/1baqkm/skytoss_pvz_replay_pack_just_hit_master_hots_with/

I might find myself doing a few more of these throughout the early stages of HOTS and once solid meta's start to form.

So for this first ""Thoughts On"" post it's going to be about SkyToss in PvZ!

As of right now SkyToss in PvZ is my go to strategy and I have been doing extremely well with it. My PvZ winrate in HOTS is currently at 70% this season (found in the statistics tab in the new UI) and I have been using some form of SkyToss for about 90% of the games I'd say.

For me SkyToss consists of:

Core Units

* Phoenix
* Void Ray

Support Units

* Tempest/Carrier

Tanking Units

* Zealot
* Archon

I've been basing my SkyToss strategy around a Phoenix/Void Ray/Zealot mix. While playing SkyToss you end up with a lot of excess minerals so that's where all the zealot dumps come in. The zealots are really good tanking units since they're cheap and relatively beefy and take shots away from the important air units. Then the Tempests or Carriers come in depending on what I see the zerg is making late game as support. Tempests for dealing with very turtle like zergs going brood lords and carriers for the other things really. I will also add archons in if I see that my spending is a little out of whack and I have a large bank of gas at some point. They're mostly situational and I don't make them every game.

So onto the analysis.

[Game 1](http://drop.sc/304021)

You see that the title of this post is ""AKA Why Phoenix's are awesome"" and I'll be emphasizing that point with these first two replays. The second two aren't as heavily focused on the Phoenix's.

So this game is a very basic overview and introductory like game show casing my style of SkyToss. I open with some light pressure that simply sets up a 3rd base and then I go into 2-3 stargate production with 3 bases.

**THE OPENING BUILD IS NOT IMPORTANT**

You can open whatever you'd like really. That part doesn't matter. As long as you get to this nice convergence point safely then you're good to go. 

So I get void rays out of my stargates first because they pack a big punch and do not require energy to do their damage. You need to get a good base of voids up first before you can go crazy with phoenix and other things so that way you don't simply die to a large roach or roach/hydra push to the front before you can really get going.

Now after I have a good void count up then I can start with the Phoenix. This is my answer to the inevitable ""But what about Hydras?"" question.

Just watch the replay and be amazed. Let me give you a few statistics before I go a little more into this. 

Phoenix's do 5 damage and 10 vs Light. They attack twice. Meaning they do 10 damage and 20 vs Light. Hydra's, especially since Phoenix are easily massed and shoot quite quickly.

As we see in this game Phoenix's are quite key in taking out the very deadly

It's even more evident in the second push.

[Game 2](http://drop.sc/304020) (I know the title says 3

So this is where we see what happens when we DON'T have Phoenix's in our army. This game after a successful Oracle harass opening I still get to the same convergence point of 2-3 stargates getting void rays out and a 3rd base. Except this game

So before I make my point I want to note at how bad units that cannot shoot up are at dealing with air units.

As we watch the first push into the zergs base my army gets shit on quite easily. He's still maxed while I dip down to 160. There are still a lot of Hydras left on the ground. This is because I didn't have a phoenix army to support the void rays and tempests by taking down the Hydra threat like what happened in game 1.

Now fast forward a bit and I realize this no Phoenix thing isn't going to work very well. I get a good mix back with a good amount of phoenix's and the next major battle all of a sudden looks much more like the one in the first game.

[Game 3](http://drop.sc/304019) (Again

So this game opens basically the same as game 2. A successful (very successful) Oracle opening leads to the convergence point of 2-3 stargates and void rays coming out with a 3rd base. 

This game mostly just solidifies the main point again and shows how good void rays are at killing corruptors and how you shouldn't attacking into a full anti-air army that has a bunch of spores underneath it.

[Game 4](http://drop.sc/304022)

This final game is an added utility of the Phoenix. Some other ideas that have come out to deal with this SkyToss style is to get Vipers and use their grappling hook ability (I can't recall the name of it right now TT) to pull the important units in to be sniped. Phoenix are quite good at dispatching of Vipers before or after a battle takes place. Even though they are armored and won't take the extra damage from the Phoenix they still fall to Phoenix's nicely.

You can mostly chase them down after a fight very easily or poke forward with them before a fight to try and snipe them beforehand.

This game also just solidifies the idea of SkyToss = good and Carriers being super sexy as well.


Well that's it for this first post of my thoughts on how HOTS is going at the moment! I hope this sparks some good discussion and maybe inspires some of you to play more SkyToss in PvZ! I'll do another one of these on one of the other match ups as soon as I can get a style that is seemingly at least stable. PvP is a cluster fuck at the moment and PvT is basically the same as before and there's also some weird shit with the Hellbats so we'll wait to see what happens with them soon. I'll most likely be doing a PvT Oracle opening one of these as the next one though.

Thanks for reading!

*1.  Immortal barely wins with a little hull left

*2.  Stalkers barely win with 1 left with little hull left

*3. Stalkers win handily

*4. Stalker wins with light damage to hull

*5. ~~Stalkers barely win with one left~~ Too close to call, whether the mutas focus fire stalkers weakened by glaive bounces.

*6. Brood Lord just barely wins

*7. Stalkers win only losing 1

*8. A little bit of a trick question. Colossos does 2x15 damage each attack and broodlings are 30 hp

*9.  Pretty much a tie here (the colossos survives

*10.  Stalker wins with 1/2 hull gone

*11. Marines wreck losing only 1 marines

*12. DT wins with only shield gone

*13. zelots win 1 survives w/ full health a second has very little hull left

*14. DT wins with 1 left w/ most it's hull

*15. Phoenix wins with 1/3 it's hull left

*16. Mutas stomp with 3 left over

Edit:  Too many due to formatting :(

Edit 2: Turns out questions 5 is too close to call and has a number of small factors that can change the outcome

Overall I've got a [75%](http://imgur.com/evGI85D) win rate vs Terran. Mostly using this build. If you're struggling with PvT in platinum or lower

Basic build order is:

9 Pylon

13 Gateway

14 Assimilator

16 Pylon

17 Cyber Core

18 Assimilator

20 Pylon

23 Stargate

After that, 2 Oracles, mix of Stalkers, Zealots, etc, proxy pylon, harass with Oracles as best you can and push up the front with your main army. It's a fairly simple build that works best if your opponent has taken an early expand.

At the moment, FleetKeys, and DarkGrid.

I have been a champion of DarkGrid since I first started using it quite a long time ago. **It has a lot going for it:**

* Extremely ergonomic.
* Easy access to all ten control groups - you'll be wishing you had more.
* Easy access to all eight camera hotkeys.
* Abilities are generally uniform among units (eg - F is Forcefield

While I have looked at both TheCore and FleetKeys

I have updated DarkGrid to HotS

[**Screenshot**](http://i.imgur.com/4UxrQJT.png)

Here are some features of this trainer:

* No need to memorize a graphic of the hotkeys. The application teaches you all of them.
* Interactive images for several of the training levels to help memory retention.
* Learning and Training Modes

What I'm looking for here is ***constructive*** feedback and feature requests before I post this thing onto r/starcraft. *This is an alpha build*

* Personal profile that keeps track of which questions you miss the most. A training level that revolves around asking you only these most-missed questions.
* More images beyond level 2 and level 3 content.
* Support for more hotkey layouts via .sc2hotkeys files.
* Support for all three races.

This will also be open-source when the final build comes out.  Thanks for your help.

__vs Terran bio__:

Versus Terran bio I almost always go __1-1-0 -&gt; 2-2-0 -&gt; 2-3-1 -&gt; 3-3-2 -&gt; 3-3-3__ When running double forge. It seems really arbitrary but there is actually some thought behind it.

- The first reason is simple

- Secondly

- Thirdly and less transparent, the sooner you actually get benefit from your investment the better of course. There is about 90 seconds time where you don't have your attack yet where you could have extra shields.

- Fourthly and most opaguely, meaning that you arrive at 3-3-3 a whole 220 seconds sooner.

- Fifthly, that nexus would have lived with 50 hp left if it had +1 shields.

- This is personal for me

- I know that emp negates shield upgrades entirely, for good reason.

:__vs Terarn mech__:

I essentially feel that any form of armour is completely useless versus mech and not worth the cost, it's really only important versus marines, zealots, mutas and Zerglings or other rapid fire units with a low damage attack. Vs mech I like to get 1 forge and 1 core and go air attack and ground attack because air units definitely have a place against mech and the mech player against protoss does want armour because zealots, voids and carriers are some of the biggest enemies of mech, you don't want to fight + 3 armour thors with unupgraded carriers. Armour is also very important versus void rays.

While it would be intuitive to get shields against mech because you tend to get some air units with it

__vs Mutas__:

I tend to go just flat out double forge shield/armour against mutas. I don't think there is ever a reason to get attack instead of shield against muta play:

- You may think you want to harm mutas with stalkers but let's be honest

- Muta play typically involves mutas and zerglings

- Shields benefit buildings, it does matter.

- If you go phoenix against mutas

__vs Protoss__:

I really don't see a good reason to get shields or even armour against protoss,False,self,t5_2tkqb,1358670458.0,,master,t3_16vm8g

The friends I currently rent an apartment with are not very big into SC2.

I would like to set up a pseudo team house/apartment  somewhere in the US with people that have a living situation similar to mine.

It wouldn't really cost anything aside from moving expenses.  Everyone would continue working low level wage jobs to pay the bills. It would be a normal ""renting an apartment with friends"" situation. In this case though everyone would happen to be an aspiring SC2 professional.

This new change seems to be a huge step forward. Honestly, but also because of fungal &amp; infested terran nerfs.
  
Here are the numbers:  
VR DPS against non-armored before the patch: 10(13.3 when charged)  
VR DPS against non-armored after the patch: 12(12 when using ability)  
VR DPS against armored before the patch: 16.7(26.6 when charged)  
VR DPS against armored after patch: 20(32 when using ability)  
  
At first glance it might seem like a minor buff to it's DPS. However, because fights have the tendency to snowball out of control. Whichever side takes a lead in the fight during the initial 1-2 seconds of it usually crushes the other side in the battle. This is what's best about letting people manually activate the charge - you can start the battle with almost double the DPS to armored targets compared to the old Void Ray.

It will mean that Void Rays are going to be very cost-efficient against corruptors and basically everything armored(maybe with the exception of the thor).

Void Rays lost their bonus to massive

Hello guys and gals

I've been quite busy with building up this site in the past 4 days and I'm quite happy with the amount of content I have on it to start promoting it.  My site is generally for Protoss players as I am a Protoss player myself.  I have replay packs, etc that will most likely help you improve your gameplay.  If you don't know, I've been making Youtube videos for Protoss players since WoL.  I'm trying to contribute to the community as much as I can.  For now I've started 2 amazing series; one is The HotS Seat and the other is Starting From Scratch.

**[The HotS Seat](http://flatlinesc2.com/category/video/the-hots-seat/)**

This series is where I breakdown a set of replays of a Protoss Pro and figure out his/her builds, State, and Squirtle).  This series is for all leagues.

[**Starting From Scratch**](http://flatlinesc2.com/category/video/starting-from-scratch/)

This series is where I make my journey from Bronze to Master on the American Server.  I try to commentate majority of the time but I am human so please excuse some moments where I'm quiet.  But in this series

I have a lot of ideas that I am aiming to add to my site.  For example

Please take some time out of your day and check out my site.  I do greatly appreciate feedback on what I can improve upon.

1364789261.0,1beh5a,Very Effective PvP All-in Phoenix Build,VELL1,25,2,21,"Hello guys

So I saw a wonderful post about PvZ

Right now I am 1st place in my diamond division and hopefully I will progress to masters at some point. So if you are diamond and up

So first of all [this is my percentage](http://img837.imageshack.us/img837/7630/winei.jpg) in PvP. Right now it’s a 71% and most of the losses were from cheese

1. Overall build is to go 3 stalker rush to be safe against 4 gate and other plays like that into fast stargate into phoenix. Between first and second phoenix build a robo to produce immortals. Harass with phoenix to force stalkers and then finish him off with mostly zealot + 1-2 immortal army.

2. Important to save your stalkers
3. Once you encounter your final engagement
4. If you can – kill sentries while harassing. They are what can get you killed. If your zealots are trapped n FFs – you will absolutely lose. Therefore #1 priority for lifting = sentries. Funny enough

5. Replays: 
http://drop.sc/316574 So here is the most common way the game progresses. I go 3 stalker rush for scouting, force him to overreact with stalkers and finish him off with an all-in build. The one thing that could have gone better is I could have gone some more immortals. Usually having two is somewhat desirable. 

http://drop.sc/316578 This build absolutely destroyed robo-openings for obvious reasons. Just make sure you don’t get trapped in force fields. Therefore you first targets should be sentries and then zealots. Once your zealots are free to do damage

http://drop.sc/316587 Here is an interesting game. The guy went for oracle and got shut down completely. However he proceeded to go with void rays and defended really well. But I went wave after wave after wave of units and eventually overpowered him. Important to note, but once you start producing units at full cycles – it becomes an all-in. You either win or die trying. 

http://drop.sc/316571 Here the guy went for fast oracle, since phoenix are so much faster.

http://drop.sc/316576 Here the build had to be adjusted because he went for voidrays + stalkers. So I had to have some more anti-air

http://drop.sc/316568 So here is the how I lose: A very strong delayed 4 gate pushed. Could have been defended

6. You would think that this build is bad against blink. This build completely annihilates blink play. You just need to wait for immortals to come out . Once they are out, I couldn’t find any blink plays, but I assure you this build is potent against it. 
7. The absolute anti-build against is archon play. The only thing to do is to block your ramp with building and build cannons. Also pray he is stupid enough to attack you. If he chooses to expand

So I'm here to both share with you guys and to look forward your feedback


**The replay**
This is the replay of the final build perfectly executed on ohana
[Demo replay](http://www.mediafire.com/?xayn9rkqnk763q3)

I'm not giving more replays yet


**The build order**
*Note: I'm using Ĉ to abbreviate chronoboost

    9 - Pylon
    Ĉ x 2
    13 - Gateway
    scout proxy positions on main and natural then send to scout
    14 - Gas
    15 - Pylon
    Ĉ
    send two probes to gas
    18 - Cyber
    19 - Gate (2)
    20 - Gas (2)
    two probes on this one too
    21 - WG (Ĉ I)
           Stalker
    Minicut probes for pylon
    23 ASAP - Pylon

    Ĉ WG (II) 
    Stalker (2)
    Stalker (3)
    Ĉ stalker from first gate (so it catches up)

    30 - Cut probes and send probe to natural
           Nexus
           Pylon
    Add a probe to each gas for a total of 3
    Resume probes*
     Sentry x2 - one will be slightly supply blocked
    Ĉ the late sentry
    
    6'10 - Two sentries pop
             Morph gateways
             Warp zealot+sentry
             Very short 42/42 supply block before nexus finishes


**Commentaries**

The critical parts of the builds are:

* Scouting inbase and natural proxy positions
* Get the second gate asap and as close as possible to the choke - move a probe immediatly after you queued the 19th probe.
* The 23 Pylon can VERY easily supply blocks you and screw up everything
* Only add missing probes to the gas after you've built the Nexus-Pylon
* Finally


As soon as your 2d and 3d stalker pop (at the same time), but do not overextend, do not sacrifice them for a few probes. 3 stalkers do NOT one shot probes (you need 4), and you want to cost efficiently trade army or to back.

The important thing with these 3 stalkers is to 1) optionally panic your opponent 2) get a good idea of what he's doing. Either you can walk up ramp and directly look at the buildings (best case scenario)


**Safety vs allins**

*Feel free to correct me for anything I say in here. I may be wrong at any moment.*


**4gate:** The two 6'10 sentries (plus the two units of your choice immediatly after, and you can easily wait for an additional two sentry warpin to deny the access to your main.

*Edit*: it may be necessary to chrono sentries against 10gate 4gates

**3gate robo** You'll soon have a 3gate robo of your own with much more eco

**DT rush** I've recently experienced that, your robo should be in time unless you messed up.

**Blink allin** This is the reason why I still hesitate to do this on cloud kingdom (antiga is banned from the map pool here

**1base colossus** According to bmanCO

**Zealot archon bust** This kind of composition is very obvious and easy to scout with your first obs. You'll need to wallin with gateways at your natural. Get a normal army composition

Builds I'm still trying to figure out:

* Various phenixes build (if scouted early I guess a 5gate blink followup is best
* (Edit) Some warp prisms plays? Is it a counterbuild? (Credits to LannisterStarcraft)

Here are 2 PvZ builds which I like to use

**1) MC's 4-Gate pressure with DT follow-up**

*This build is great fun to use because it is straightforward

FFE&gt; Zealot

30 pylon

|| Stalker

40 3x Gate

42 Pylon

48 2x gas (push out to place pylons)

|| Dark shrine

|| Warp in 4 zealots and pressure the third base

|| Warp in 4 more zealots

~65 Robo 

|| DS finishes

~70 3x Gate

|| Blink

~100 3rd Base

If you kill the third you are in good shape. If you kill the third and natural you are in amazing shape. If you kill all his bases (this has happened to me in Masters) you will probably be laughing uncontrollably.

**2) Genius' Stargate into Twilight**

*This is my default build against 2 base play because it is ridiculously safe. IMO Stargate is the best way to play against fast lair as it will scout the tech quickly and gives harass options.*

FFE&gt;Zealot (no Warpgate

30 Gas

31 Pylon

34 Stargate

34 Sentry

38 Gas

40 Pylon

|| Sentry

~46 Void Ray

50 Pylon

|| Phoenix

56 3x Gate

|| Continue phoenix production to 4 or 5. Stay sentry heavy (~8-10)

~85 Twilight Council

~100 3rd Base

I was a high master/low GM player in Wings of Liberty but I stopped playing last December. Now I'm thinking of getting back into SC2

So here we go:

1. How is the situation with HoTS? Has everyone switched over or is the community split between WoL and HoTS players? Have there been any major tournaments with HoTS? Any good VODs to watch?

2. What is the standard protoss metagame vs all three races? I expect that with the new units and with a 7 month gap

3. How is the SC2 community? Some of my friends that play LoL have been saying that SC2 is dead because everyone switched over to LoL. Is this true? :(

4. Since I'm getting a fresh start

1343135863.0,x2knx,Question about macro'ing as a toss and understanding matchups,smj32091,23,2,13,"It seems that toss is a mix between zerg and terran macro.  We have gateways for producing units rapidly like zerg and we also have production facilities make units over time in a queue like terran.    
    
    
IIRC For zerg their macro mechanics come in phases
    
    

Now toss is a bit of both races. Warpgate units can be instantly warped in given that the warpgates aren't on cooldown and other tech path units from the robotics bay or stargate are produced in a queue.  Since this is a bit of both I'm guessing we have some of the advantages of both macro styles.  Like a zerg we can replenish our armies very quickly
    
     

Now here's my question. Because we have a bit of both macro mechanics
     
    
Versus terran, I would warp in or produce units with the money I have remaining and not worry how many production facilities I'm not using.     
     
   
Versus Zerg it's the exact opposite. Their lategame is very dangerous due to the amount of units they can produce.  Midgame and earlygame we must do damage in order to stay equal or ahead with their economy.  This means we should play more like an aggressive terran  and prioritize our money in this fashion. 1. economy 2. units 3. tech.  This means I would use try to use all the production facilities available and use the remaining money for tech.  With my large amount of units I would attempt to do damage to a zerg such as denying or killing their third after a FFE.

Ok

* The carrier is issued a stop command
* The current target dies and no other target is available within launch range.
* The current target dies and the carrier is now on move command
* The target leaves the leash zone, target moved away, recall, etc)

The important takeaway here is that giving a carrier a move command won't by itself force a return, it just sometimes looks like it is because there is no marker between launch and leash radius. The new target has to be within launch radius (8) for the interceptors to come straight across to it.

Now, will simply park while the interceptors take down a target. It will then continue towards the a-move target point. So it moves in this sort of pattern: Stop at max launch range, launch, kill, return, scoot forward, stop, etc. There's a great deal of time spent docking and relaunching interceptors and moving forward

But hey wait a minute. Remember what I said above? The the carrier CAN move while attacking, getting within launch distance of the original target, and the interceptors will come straight to it. Changing the pattern to: Stop at max launch range, launch, kill, sweep across, kill, kill, then move forward a little

Yes, it's pretty shocking how fast carriers can wipe out a base compared to just a-moving through it. You can also use this to chase down fleeing brood lord packs. Have fun!


Notes:

* Be careful not to target fire on a new target before the current one is dead, then shift-queue the target-fire command on the next target. That way the interceptors will come straight over once the first target drops.
* Have graviton catapult for this
* Leash mechanic applies to the current target of course
* Not only do your interceptors not have to return

tl:dr; you can make carriers attack BW-style (kinda) by stutter-stepping them.",self,t5_2tkqb,False,,platinum,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/allthingsprotoss/comments/13hyrz/litte_carrier_micro_trick_i_dont_see_mentioned/

I'm not joking - though I have no illusions that this is some ""METAGAME CHANGING"" build or something, and aware of ""army values"".

Opening up Stargate seems to work nicely on NA (I'm Diamond on there, and get a few kills.

However I decided to (and this originate on KR not NA) go a little further with it, then stop and focus on ""normal"" units like robo tech and so forth. This goes for far more of them at the cost of ground units, which may seem strange however as you'll see in some of my replays here, with a large contingent of nix you can still defend things - providing you have **good scouting and army value awareness.**

After the nix opening, maybe 3 cannons depending on how safe you feel based on the scouting from the Phoenix. A robo can be handy to make sure you have 1 obs to remove enemy obs and lookout for DT's, however I've found that with very careful and studious cannon placements from an early forge; you can negate both of those things - however that's a personal choice, I've been on a cannon binge lately; getting them in large numbers in all matchups for fun.

There is a certain point where you'll probably need to defend the ""big push"" from your opponent who'll be annoyed at the way the play goes down - this is where nix control and keeping them alive the whole game is very important. You'll be down on ground units obviously because you've spent more on the nix, the next push will come when a couple of the carriers are out and you'll be fine then, and then fine after that... and so on. :)

Anyway

Depending on what you see, you'll need to prepare to graviton beam like a boss, put more cannons down, that sort of thing. Safe to say; if you see your opponent getting a third, you get one too. Once 2-3 carriers are out and your opponent hasn't taken one, you can feel safe in moving out to take yours because you should be fine to defend it.

Upgrades are kinda required, just so you can make sure you have air superiority and also nice ups for your carriers once they are on the field.

I've had various responses to seeing some nix -&gt; carriers - ranging from quite odd - people getting templar and archons only (which is cute, almost like an all in - however if you have a couple of cannons you should keep some alive - or get 3/3/3 and blink on stalkers ASAP. I'm not talking ""cool bro I have 3/3/3 at the 34 minute mark"" I mean super fast. Triple robo if you have to. Because the only thing that has really beaten me down with this is that one play, because obviously stalkers are nice and mobile, and with huge ups they will smash carriers even when carriers get close to the tipping point.

Another big weakness as noted in the seperate thread is that a blink stalker timing early on can really wreck your shit if it's done right. I personally don't feel that phoenix openings are ""way more vulnerable"" than any other style - it's a matter of how your opponent utilises their stalkers and their blink. But, given that you can have trouble getting a decent ground army up because you're focusing on nix, but still. 

Extra side-notes to think about which you may want to think about for me because I'm lazy:

* Getting the nix onion-crystal upgrade can (no joke) be worth it sometimes. I've gotten it on a couple of occasions - it can really help if your opponent is being stubborn and still continues to get colossi with blink stalkers - keeping the nix out of range of the stalkers as much as possible is a huge thing. But again - the trouble I've been having with the build is dealing with blink stalkers

* I have no idea what is the most cost efficient and useful for the air upgrades - I would assume that given the interceptors shoot twice you'd want to get weapons as a priority over armour - however if you're facing off against mass stalkers (which as pointed out many times is the **most common** defense) - you may want armour

* Chargelots are something that work quite nicely with the carriers as both a meatshield and also as damage dealers against stalkers. If you position them right they can be quite useful in blocking out the stalkers - or if you hold them under the carriers when stalkers blink under them to attack you'll shread them easily.

* Having a mothership can be very very nice of course, you can lose a battle from your *own* vortex. I'm not saying don't do it - just make sure you think very hard before you place a vortex down if you get to that stage. Mass recall however would be my use of choice for a mothership if you get to it, rush up to an opponent's expo, kill it, recall back. Similar to very very late stage PvT in Brood War. 

**Again with my little disclaimer: I'm in no way a pro at playing Protoss, and if a scrub like me can do ok with it at a diamond level perhaps some of you masters guys might be able to work with it. Also worth noting that I don't have a particular build down - I play to what I see and also whether I'm drunk or not.**

Remember this last little piece of advice: This is a **fun** build, you're in a good spot. Measure your opponent's army and calculate the cannons you need to defend if he pushes, and remember to LIFT ALL THE THINGS! if he attacks.

Here are some reps for your enjoyment.

Im not complaining or saying this isn't a helpful subreddit because it is I'm just saying i see higher level players constantly demoralizing lesser skilled players convincing them not to experiment with complicated play styles lol I'm sure all master league players on this subreddit experimented with all-ins, not getting supply blocked and spending money. All your really doing is deterring lower level players from trying challenging builds and really acquiring there own play style through trial and error.

This all-in opened with a Gateway on 10 supply in order to rush out the fastest warpgate timing possible (WARPGATE FINISHES AT 5:15 O_o).  Hell

Thoughts: The 16 pylon at the natural is a great way to get a fast wall in against annoying speedling allins. 7 phoenix is an interesting number, sOs does some cute stuff not noted in the build. He builds a proxy pylon in sight of Effort's zerlings just so his MSC can get some free kills before he cancels it. He also uses the MSC to attack the building third to damage it. He doesn't do anything from that damage, but he may in some games warp in some zealots to go kill it.

Edit: Make that 10. http://drop.sc/330737. I'm going to go ahead and say that this is as perfect an execution of this build as can be expected from a player my level. very proud of how I played this game.

These are my last 9 games

After going back and looking I only had one game vs the true marine/SCV allin, just most of them.

Enjoy

http://drop.sc/330690 – Executed the early game very poorly, and I built my stalker before the MSC. All mistakes. Terran opens cc first on the low ground with bunker. I run past and kill some SCVs, and force a lift on the expand. Send the MSC to mineral line to harass, while my zealot/stalker prevent him from leaving the bunker. I total killing 5 SCVs and 5 marines, but lose all of my units. Behind this I’ve put up an expand, and built a stargate. He counters with widow mine/marine drop, while I oracle harass him. I fend off the drop with my second oracle and stalker, while I macro up to colossi/immortal/stalker/chargelot/sentry/void ray/carrier/archon. (I am not exaggerating.) Very little is going to beat that composition

http://drop.sc/330691 – If you want an exact “build order” I executed this one really well. I got a second gas early, but was nice enough to tell me his race. He went for fast concussive shells, which stopped my push. I run the stalker/zealot and kill the few marines with my MSC. He hits with the marauders, but accomplishes nothing, with zealots on the ramp. I build a void ray first to defend because of the aggression, then I go into oracles. I push with a 5 gate, 2 szealots, and a void ray

http://drop.sc/330692 – Guy sends two scv scouts, I micro and kill all his units without losing anything, expanding behind it. I attack with my three units, and kill the 5 marines at home, but lose my zealot. His proxy sends a marauder at my expansion. I recall home, at which point he ggs.

http://drop.sc/330693 – Marine/SCV allin. I scout it with my zealot/MSC, which traps him in a corner of my base. I get out stalkers, and utilize the art of micro to kill him. I did really badly and got supply blocked a bunch but I still held it off pretty easily, since I had teched up to oracles at this point.

http://drop.sc/330694 – Reaper harass – I fend it off with my second stalker and expand behind my push. Kill a supply depot to get in, and he does a push, but I’m just barely able to hold it off with archon/zealot/void ray + warpins. (I was going storm because I’m bad at using storm, so I didn’t have my hts turned into archons, so they weren’t very helpful.) At this point it’s 45 workjers to 33, and I’m a base up. He tries another push, but I hold it off with (preformed) archon/zealot/void/sentry. Warpin to kill the drop he did on my natural and push with my main army, for the win.

http://drop.sc/330695 – He opens reapers. It doesn’t work, and recall it home when it gets trapped. Send in the first oracle and kill what few marines he has left, and start on the mineral line, at which point he leaves.

http://drop.sc/330696 – This was a fun one. Proxy two rax + bunker. I didn’t scout it at all. No scout? No problem. I kill the SCV making the second bunker with my zealot before he can finish it, but he’s expanded. I sit my stalkers outside his bunkers in front and send my oracle to his line to harass. He can’t send to fight the oracle or he will lose the front to the stalkers (this is kind of the whole crux of this strategy) Between the oracle in his natural and the one in his main, I killj 20 SCVs, making it 9 to 38. He does a push, but five marines and two marauders does not commonly beat 6 stalkers, an immortal, and two oracles. I get some more units and go kill him.

http://drop.sc/330697 – He opens CC on the highground behind wall. He has three marines to defend my push. Micro ensues. I kill 7 workers, while my oracle hits his line. It racks up another 8 worker kills and 4 marine kills before being forced away. He counters with a 13 marine push before I warp in and push it away. He does some damage (7 probes) but it’s not too bad. Utilizing the art of micro, the oracle gets another two workers. I bait out his army again, and kill it outright this time, while sending a second oracle in to kill his natural. After getting down to 5 SCVs (vs 40 probes), he leaves.

http://drop.sc/330698 – This was a really funny game. He proxied a factory and lifted it into my main, the mine got 12 of my probes before I could get an obs out. But that wasn’t really so bad; I was only behind by a worker (Thanks, chronoboost!) He does a marine/mine push but the mine shoots at my zealot, which has caught up to his marines, meaning it detonated right on top of all his marines. I had a good laugh. At this point it transitions into a pretty regular macro game, except he’s going Mech. I scout the mech with my oracle. (well, really I scout that he’s rung his *entire base* in turrets, which means mech.) Fortunately for me, run it over the opposing army

This week's build orders are going to be:

* PvP - [Hwangsin's Stargate Expand](http://imbabuilds.com/hots-protoss/hots-pvp/pvp-hwangsins-stargate-expand/)

I've been hard pressed to find another PvP build with the same safety yet aggressive capabilities as this build. I've found 1 Base Stargate all-ins to be very strong against this build but I haven't faced enough to consider them a complete counter.

* PvZ - [Phoenix into Macro](http://jaypowersc2.com/page/story/4/)

My weakest PvZ moments are certainly against Mutalisks and when getting a third. Opening with a Stargate should solve both problems. I still need to get used to timings for getting the third as well as macroing while controlling the Phoenixes. Still

I'm looking forward to analysing Stardust's PvZ builds from Dreamhack. I was a bit disappointed considering that the build does not deal with the Mutalisk problem but it's always good to have another all-in in my arsenal.

* PvT - [Rain's 1 Gate FE](http://imbabuilds.com/hots-protoss/hots-pvt/)

I haven't had the opportunity to fully flesh out the build's potential as most games ended up against proxy Widow Mines for some reason. From the few games that I did manage to enter into a macro game against a Terran I ended up trapped in my base without a third. At the end of the week I started getting used to how I should move around while taking a third and saw a glimpse of what Late game could be like. I almost felt like a Zerg.

Everygame my intention is to go my standard PvT opening which can be found here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_FlwEcjwYs ! Ofcourse through scouting and adapting my build changes often (eg 18 nexus in response to CC first)

Here I have 6 games from my livestream where I went 6-0  in PvT


PS. I'm currently in the process of creating a standard/follow up tutorial but still playing with ideas. Hit me up if you have any thoughts about this :)



So here goes! Game #1 on Whirlwind (13:28)

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEHdrrR0BMs


My opponent goes CC first


Game #2 Starstation (15:11)

Super standard from both players, with storm + collo I push him back to his base where I use my proxy pylons to reinforce immediately and do strong damage which in the long run wins me the game


http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfivZFRXOZI


Game #3 Klontas Mire (12:22)

My opponent goes 2 rax reaper without be seeing second rax. I get annoyed after so many reapers and move out with my early units to pressure back. We each lose a few units and workers and end around even going into a macro game. I go collos and scout a third inbase CC and so I prepare to all in as he takes it. His units get caught off guard on my side of the map and I take a very easy win.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfve-5z75qs


Game #4 Belshire (15:34)

My opponent opens with a gas/nno reaper so I take a second gas instead and play safe. He goes bio tank. we have a few fights, we continue playing macro game and end up with the win. Was a bit of a whacky/non standard game.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbLh6zpkmQE


Game #5 Zerus Prime (14:44)
1 base reaper into 111 widow mine pressure with expansion. i dont lose much because of a great scout. he sees my robo bay while dropping


http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udWGr2d2Y1o


Game #6 Belshire (16:55)

Super standard game from both of us

If my opponent has pushed lategame and has gone Sky Terran (Raven/BC) with a Hellbat mineral dump. I have no idea. Voids get seeker missiled where I lose everything unless I run

I believe without reservation that everyone benefits from the attention and guidance of the right people, I've had quite a few people who couldn't afford coaching contact me and ask for help. I always answer their questions and push them towards a learning resource that I think would help them, but in terms of 1-on-1 coaching, I just didn't have the time to do it myself.  

A few months ago, but it's understandable - coaching is a business and I was asking them to take a risk.  

Despite this minor set-back, and several team members have already expressed their enthusiasm about the project and offered their time and resources to help get started.  

I'd like to ask for your trust and support

I only go templar into archon when I see my opponent making a lot of air to air units like vikings. The only thing I don't like about the colossus is that it can get sniped by ships so easily. Otherwise it seems like its better in every other way. It has a longer range and a nice sweeping attack. In a big ground battle protoss really needs that support from the back of the army and it works very well with forcefields. Against, i'll get templar instead of colossus to deal that area-damage that I need because they won't be countered by the vikings, and then I just morph them into archons when their energy is gone. In every other situation I make colossus.

 Is this a legit strategy? Are there other advantages each has over the other that I didn't mention? When do you guys like to use each unit? I feel like there's another advantage to archons that I'm not realizing. I don't actually know how the pros use them.

I've been getting fairly angry at losses recently. I think I've GGed on ladder maybe once in the past few weeks. I just don't feel like anything that has to do with me losing warrants a GG. I either feel like they played gimmicky and terrible

I then get frustrated after I lose multiple games that way and eventually I just rage out and close starcraft and play something else.

How do you stop it from happening in the first place?

1349202547.0,10tuj6,Suggestion for phoenix: Make graviton beam work with flying units,hugolp,18,5,12,"I dont know if this idea can be implemented in WoL or it has to wait for HotS but if someone finds it useful I would appreciate if it can go into the US battlenet forums and suggest it.

__The problem__: For a long time it has fustrated me that the phoenix, instead of going phoenix. The problem is that in small numbers phoenix get eaten alive by mutas and they become useless, while its near impossible to outproduce the zerg. Phoenix can never achieve a meaningful number to counter mutas, unless they are already out.

__The solution__: So the idea is for graviton beam to work also in flying (non-masive) units. It would just hold the unit in place and unable their attack while the spell lasted. The point is now stalkers and phoenix can work together reinforcing each other. When the stalkers get to the mutas, in front of mutas because of this synergy between stalkers and phoenix. Its also quite micro intensive which is a plus.

How it does affect the rest of the units?

__Zerg__

* Overlords/Overseers: Not an issue. The only point might be that it can deny scouting a bit more efficiently
* Corruptors: Corruptors decimate phoenix
* Broodlords are massive and I dont have the beta so dont know about vipers.

__Protoss__

* Phoenix: Its already impossible to scape a phoenix vs phoenix battle so it makes no sense to use the graviton beam. The only issue is that one phoenix could hold an attacking phoenix for the stalkers to kill it

* Void Ray: Again

* Observer: If the observer is detected it dies extremely quick so

* Warp prism: Phoenix are quicker than warp prism. While it can make it a bit more difficult for the warp prism because it can be hold in place

* Dont have the beta so I can not give opinion on oracle or mothership core. The rest (mothership

__Terran__

Here is where there is more change

* Viking: I dont see how graviton beam used on vikings would change the match up a lot.

* Raven: Same.

* Medivac: It would help deal with medivacs since now drops can be freezed before they drop. This was not the reason why the idea came to me, Stargate opening is weak in PvT and they are looking in ways of solving it. This change could help making an stargate opening viable in PvT since it can help defend drops and allows for all (or most of) the units to be in the front, unlike now. It also increases micro needed (phoenix almost always requires more micro to be honest).

* Banshee: It would help deal with banshees since they could be hold in place and avoid them scaping. Since they are slower

* Battlecruiser is massive.



Initially I though it would be a great change for WoL, it might open a new tech tree for the Protoss, I am not sure the devs will be willing to change it in WoL even if they like the idea.

Some comparisons gathered from Liquipedia:

* DPS favours MS by about 66% at 0 upgrades on all sides, 7 to 5

* Speed favours MSC by ~0.47

* HP favours MS greatly with 350/350 compared to 130/60

* In terms of abilities, while MSC cannot. 

* MS, takes 100 seconds, and energy gathered by the core is lost, and must be started from 50 again. MS costs 8 total supply, MSC costs 2

&gt;So, greater durability,  and lose photon overcharge, and all else is broadly unimportant/minor given its purpose


While I don't claim for a second to have knowledge or experience in these situations

**PvT**: I see absolutely no place for it here

**PvP**: Potentially more uses now that void ray mid games are relatively common, it would get one-shot by 9 tempests. In WoL it was sometimes used in endgames for vortex to gain positioning advantages in colossus wars, but vortex is gone and colossus wars are less common. 

**PvZ**: Here I think is the most likely place to see it (still, it theoretically means that, until an actual engagement, the free locusts can be killed for free too. The mothership would stay WAYYY back so it doesn't get pulled. Tempests can be used to shoo away overseers and thus the cloaked templars can stay out front ready to feedback, unpestered by the locusts. Again, though, the supply cost is worth considering. As an aside


While I don't think ANY units should be changed for a long time, is it a problem anyway? It took over a year for the archon toilet to be found and used semi-reliably, maybe other tactics will be found with it too.

My main issue is that, which is also easily sniped. From watching all these games, I feel as if Blizzard ignored some of the  fundamental issues regarding protoss - mainly a lack of flexibility in comparison to other races. PvZ seems to still be about either the late game or the 10 minute all in, PvT is about not dying in the early and mid game and then winning in the late game, PvP is this new wonky air-to-air stuff mixed with 1 base play and late game where each player has 5489057 colossi and motherships. Yea we have this new harrassment unit in the oracle, but you can't really use it in a straight up fight. Terran has received increased flexibility, as has zerg, or swarm hosts.

1355935443.0,1545hs,About the state of PvZ and a unique new build.,OnthefarWind,14,3,24,"So ATP, I saw a unique playstyle from Parting which I have immediately tried and found incredibly successful to combat my recent woes of fighting infester-gglords.

Early mothership. Early mothership off two bases. Trying it out today it seems incredibly easy and practical. Start off with a stargate opening. Reveal the void ray. This immediately forces the zerg to cut drones

Over time

I found in Plat the immediate reaction is hydralisk, even with incredibly good micro. You have two vortexes BEFORE brood lords can come out. And the zerg is so paranoid by the fact you haven't poked with anything but a void ray that they will be at their wits end when you reveal the mothership. Couple that with the fact that detection from zerg is beautifully easy to snipe with blink, and you have this phenomenally innovative strat I will now be using from now on.

If anyone has any flaws or anything they think can be improved upon

There's a few reasons behind wanting to do this switch,  a good storm, or microing the collosus back just that little bit to keep it alive feels so good.  

However whilst I believe I can follow a build order quite nicely I'm not 100% sure on how to transition further from that tech path.  The tutorials on how to play Protoss, and as we all know, even if you follow a BO perfectly you're not guaranteed a win there and then.  

So basically I have a lot of questions here about to come your way

1.  Should I be looking at taking my 3rd before teching to collosus?
2. What's the easiest way to FF?  I seem to F click
3. Should I be trying to use HT Energy up before morphing into an Archon? 
4.  When should I be looking at getting a Mothership out?  I've still yet to use one but I've never got to late game PvZ and I've never needed it in PvT yet.
5. Does anyone have any tips on blink micro?  I've been boxing the front few and blinking them back when they're low and constantly doing that.  Is there an easier way to do it?
6. What's the better upgrade.  Shields or Armor?  If I've got double forge I want to be doing Attack/Armor or Shield.  I'm slightly unsure which to chose to be honest.
7.  What's your go to BO in each matchup currently?  I don't want anything cheesy


I'm sure I'll think of more questions soon.  I apologize if these questions seem pointless/nooby but they're questions I've thought of when playing and I think they're important enough.

My Terran friends have been working on their macro, and it seems to be working very well for them.  Since there's no one unit for Protoss that is nearly as effective, I thought I'd spin off that idea by choosing one and only one opening for each matchup and working on my macro.

                      ______________________________________________________________

Some basic analisys.. My worst matchup at the moment is my PvT since I just don't a build that fits me. I usually do the PartinG 2+ 2+ but get delayed against Terran quite some often. I feel like I kinda lose too often against widow mines with this build which delays me often since I get too scared and get too many canons out.. After on lose too pressure to MMM since I dont really have the army because I spend gas and minerals to get too my push
i.e colossus rather than trying to get archons since the splash on coloss is A LOT easier and I feel I can get out a 
3rd muccchh faster.. 


PvZ is atm my best matchup even though my stats dont say the same. I usually go mothership core open&gt; some
agression with 3 sentries and 2 zealots which is very safe and can makes me REALLY ahead.. Switch to dt's and make some damage when I later push out around 150 supply and kill the zerg with my 2+ 2+ (often delayed xD)
which often wins me the games since there are not really a lot they can do.


PvP I feel is ok. I think I need changes but it is not as bad as my PvT imo. Most the games I lose is to canon rushes and 2 gates
I  usually open oracle and transition to a huge voidray production which often wins me games escpesially in the 
later stages of the game since I just split them and upgrade them (often). I feel very comfterable in the late game mixing archons zealots and voidrays since

I'm a mid-masters Protoss on NA and I have a confession:  my PvT is abysmal.  Seriously, Colossus-based openers.  I want to get back into a heavy Obs count style of play with both Blink and a higher Gateway-unit count than I think double-Forge allows.

I'm comfortable late-game (3-4 bases with both forms of splash - not super late like Tempests/Cruiser as I don't think many games at my level really go that late) but my deaths between 8:30-14:00 are pretty numerous.  My control isn't great in mid-game skirmishes so I'm more concerned with having enough stuff to be safe and less concerned with squeezing in +1 Attack.  I do know I should get the second Forge and the TC at 50% +1 Armor.

For the sake of discussion

1.  **When do you take the Forge?**  I want to 1-Gate expand with the general setup afterwards being three Gates, is Gate &gt; Nexus &gt; Robo &gt; Forge &gt; 2x Gate too greedy?  Do I take the Forge before, at the same time as, at 50% Robo, etc.?

2.  **What does this do to your natural gas timings?**  Do you still require both in the late 6:00

3.  **How does this style work in HotS?**  Does the early-game safety of the MSC and generally later 3rd for Protoss make teching/upgrading more aggressively than this necessary?  I'm aware of the [Blink/Colossus](http://www.gamefront.com/state-on-starcraft-blink-stalkercolossus-pvt/) style but I think I would prefer the safety of earlier +1 Armor.

4.  **Are there any guides/streamers I can reference?**  Sorry

5.  **What the f@#% should my Gateway production be like through the midgame?**  This is sort of unrelated, delay Gateway units for as long as possible, etc.  What should I do - favor constant production or tech in normal, 2-base vs 2-base situations?

I was going for kind of a rough DT expand
Here are a few things that I jotted down while I was reviewing the replay:

* I need to scout more
* I need to spend chronoboost more / chrono more probes
* My probe production is spotty consistency-wise
* I floated large amounts of minerals, or units.
* I need to pick better engagements and reinforce during battles
* My 16 pylon was a tad later than I wanted
* My Twilight Council could have gone down a tiny bit sooner
* I blindly expanded without scouting the Terran
* I need be more proactive with units
* I could have taken my 4th earlier (and not in a stupid location)
* I need smarter forcefield placement (in addition to this
* I could have teched to HTs earlier and used them with my army. 
* I need to improve my macro behind my harassment. 
* I could have used more proxy/forward pylons
* I could have used photon overcharge during an engagement at my third (I also could have been more active with my mothership core)

I'm sure I've overlooked some things. If anyone could check it out that would be great! Thanks in advance.

I'm currently in Platinum. Yesterday, topping it off with a loss to a cannon-rushing gold player. 

I know that this sort of thing has been posted before, and I can't win that matchup to save my life anymore, though I'm starting to feel like I get the hang of it the more I play.

I'm trying to not just stick with these specific builds

Can anyone tell me what they did to make the jump from Plat to Diamond? Bronze to silver was fairly easy once I started playing. Silver to Gold took about 3 weeks of playing an hour or two a day. Then HoTS came out

I think part of the problem is I'm frustrated with the thought of feeling like I'm not making any progress. My goal is masters league

If anyone has any tips, or tips in general, I'd greatly appreciate it.

Late game I'm fine. The tech is finished and I have charge, etc. I just can't decide when to tech and when to make units. 

2. My second problem is related to the first one, I always screw up my engagements. This, again, is because of the stimmed forces. I can't ever evaluate my army against theirs because despite the visual size of the armies, Terran can instantaneously increase his units' values and run over my army. 

So... I have problems with stim is what it comes down to. It makes me afraid to tech and either afraid to engage or I engage in a battle that I lose because of bad evaluation. Does anyone have any tips to overcome this fear?

I have been an avid LoL player for about a year now and have recently bought SC2. I jumped right in and had one problem: this game is so hard. I actually have no idea what I'm doing. I read builds online and try to implement them and have a standard beginning build planned out for myself when I play. (9pylon, cybercore whenever gateway finishes, 16 pylon). I try to play standard builds (I never cheese basically). However no matter what I do I always lose. (To illustrate how bad I am I am rank 90 in bronze with a ~500 bonus pool). I have absolutely no idea what to do anymore. I am fairly good at LoL so I know I'm not just terrible at video games, but no matter how hard I try I get cheesed or lose fights anyways.

I generally favour marco play, I always miss that crucial forcefield on the ramp!).

Sometimes timings feel kind of random to me, the dt timing has come and gone now, if he was going dt's he'd be here now' so I expanded and tried a bit of poking with my oracle. When it was across the map, 3 dts showed up and I totally lost.

Anyway I decided to switch over and try Protoss because I do like the look of the race. I looked over a few streams and it just generally looks fun to play!

I looked up a couple of build-orders for specific match up's and set about learning them (1 each) but even if I follow it perfectly I seem to get to the around the 10 minute mark in every game where I have two full saturated bases but only a zealot or two out in the field. 

It's around this time that the enemy comes around and just steam-rolls over me. Obviously this is frustrating me a bit and I really really want to learn the race and play it properly and more importantly have fun while doing so!

[Game 2 - PvT Marine + Marauder party in my base](http://drop.sc/290631)

Now this guy took me completely by surprise. I just had no idea what to do

[Game 3 - PvP win](http://drop.sc/290632)

It's looking like we'll have over 60 players in 5 divisions going roughly around the same time. Confusion is likely. To help with this, in the next few days private groups will be setup for each division. And information will be posted on www.heartlandstarcraft.com Please stay tuned!

Hello everyone

1) Participating in the Heartland Hitmen's May Flowers Open Tournament.
2) Helping out with the tournament in some way.

Or I guess both. The sign-ups are nearly complete. We're rather close to the cut-off in several divisions (16), they will be placed on a waiting list or something similar. 

Rules:

1) You might not get placed in the division you requested. We will be producing and making brackets on Thursday May 9th. We will base your seeding and brackets based on your current ladder and career 1v1 ladder status as of that day. Ex. If you've been in Plat before and now currently Gold

2) Each round is a best of three. The opening round will be opened on Bel'Shir Vestige LE, the higher seed (or for the loser's bracket, the player who advanced further in the winners bracket) gets first choice.

3) Map pool: You may only choose these maps. 
Akilon Wastes (2)
Bel’Shir Vestige LE (2)
Klontas Mire TE (2)
Neo Planet S LE (2)
Derelict Watcher TE (2)
Zerus Prime TE (4)
Star Station (4)
Whirlwind LE (4)

4) Replays: You must submit your replays after your games are finished to one of two locations. Directly to a submission thread on our forums which will be distributed before the tournament begins

5) If you're late to your match in any round

6) Failure to comply with these rules

7) Please share news of this event with your friends

Schedule:  To help organizers get things started

Division Schedule:
12pm (CDT) - Bronze/Silver &amp; Masters
1pm (CDT) - Diamond
2pm (CDT) - Platinum

This message is your check-in message. To HOLD your spot in the tournament you will need to reply to this message with your solemn promise to show up on time. Your response should look like this.

Please respond: 

Yes I will show up 15 minutes before my scheduled game time. I know the tournament is being run on Central Daylight Time. I know what CDT is compared to my time, I will be ready and able for all of my matches on Saturday win, lose or get out.

Pretty easy.

Some alternate responses could include, I'm not playing, but I'll be there to help out, etc.

Is there anything we could do to it that might make it for suitable for HotS? Or is this something i shouldn't pursue 

anyways im currently experimenting with it

* taking an earlier expand  
* Building the mommaship core instead of a sentry.  
* since halluc is free
* maybe 1 cannon instead of 2 and make an extra gateway for stronger pressure.  

advantages?  

* the 16 min push is really strong against Roach hydra [corrupter]  
* its designed to kill the third  
* blink is helpful against muta techswitches

http://drop.sc/322544

Here is a replay of a masters game in which is one of the optimal ways of defending. 

In a PvP 2 player map cheese is extremely likely. Keep your gateway relatively close to your nexus and scout on 13. Scouting on 9 is overkill because it gives him time to react if only his pylon is down and he can transition out of it (maybe)

My method for scouting is Scout on 13 outside your base with your gateway probe (like i did)

You'll notice that when i scout the 2 gate I don't do anything drastic like throw down a forge

The 2nd pylon there can also be good because it forces him to make a decision. Do i finish the pylon and take a lot of damage or do i run back? But as you soon saw when i got the surround even though i lost a bunch of workers


**Bottom Line**
The most important thing to remember about defending a 2 gate is to not panic, pull atleast 10 probes and attack with your zealot(s) and probes.

I've played a few games now where the Zerg will go for a purely Hydra/Swarm Host composition accompanied by a ton of Overseers to snipe observers.

I've tried a few different things to combat this and I've not really found anything to be too effective. They just keep sending wave after wave of stuff to dwindle your army down.

I've tried going mass Colossus and stutter-stepping back (with Thermal Lance) to pick off the locusts before they can fire

I've tired HT with storm

I've tried Voids and chargelots but then there's no good way of dealing with the locusts so the chargelots melt and the hydras have free reign over the Voids.

I don't want to believe that zerg just generally dominates protoss at that level, I've tried almost any style out there in PvZ - from one base all-ins to fast 3 base, from double stargate into mass cannons carriers templar(which actually worked decently) to sentry immortal all-ins.

No matter my strats, scout, react, defend their multipronged agression until i'm either forced to all in(terran snipes too much of my econ) or when i'm maxed. Easy. I wish my PvZ would be like this one day. Right now I'm not sure how this could be achieved.

Anyway here somethings that MC did that I think made him so effective:

* Traded his ground army well. He split it into two groups, and he did it all at once to maximize damage instead of slowly doing it with small groups that do no damage

* He also went voidray before carrier while getting his air upgrades

* Focus on high templar over archons and colossus. He got a crazy amount of high templar which allowed him to feedback infestors

* Don't move out until double vortex

That's right :D My present to you guys this year is two full (sort of) days of free coaching to anyone who would like it! That's **Wednesday December 26th** and **Saturday December 29th**.

Thursday is my brothers birthday and Friday I have work

I'll be in the Allthingsprotoss SC2 chat channel whenever I'm on so if you see me there simply message me with details on the following:

* League
* What you want help with
* Skype username

I'll be on busy whenever I'm in a lesson. 

Lessons will be anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour depending on how many people are interested and what exactly I need to cover with each student.

I'll officially be starting the coaching at **2 PM EST** on both days. Up until then if you see me on don't ask for coaching because that's my free time before to play.

I'm playing in HotS due to being in the AHGL as Mozilla's captain. I'm finding that if I don't harass (generally with oracle or prism play) I get left behind when playing against the higher leagues (I'm WoL Silver

I can see 2 primary reasons for this, even ones I beat. Second, while I can keep up my probe and upgrade production I have a hard time context switching enough to hit my warp gate key, camera key back to my base, warp things, then jump back to my harassment without pretty much always losing my harassing units.

Likely any tips for doing this will be 'just keep doing it until you are good at it' but I was wondering if anyone who worked out being able to do this had any insights that might help.

Another thing

Background: I've been a Protoss player for a long time now and when I was finally making good progress in WoL I was forced to switch to HotS if I wanted to play in this league which has been more jarring than I'd like. Much more harass play (that I have to do and react to) as well as learning how to counter the new units as I can't just watch some streams and see how it all works.

PS: If anyone knows any coaches that have been playing HotS and are reasonably priced for my skill level ($20-40 USD/h) I'd be interested in talking to them.

Since he doesn't have one for Protoss. I decided to just adopt the idea over the Protoss: i.e. pick either a Tier 1 unit (Zealot) or Tier 1.5 unit (Stalkers) and mass those while taking 2 base with constant focus on supply awareness and probe production.

When playing Terran and Zerg doing macro play

But with Protoss

I'm suspecting several things:

* Higher cost per unit of Protoss is making it difficult for me to just literally adopt Terran or Zerg macro benchmarks.
* Maybe this macro play is not possible to begin with
* My sense of macro is horrible
* Protoss as a race is hard to try and pull off a strictly macro play.
* Macro play for either zealots only or stalkers only or both would've worked if I stayed on top of macro more.",self,t5_2tkqb,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/allthingsprotoss/comments/yon9o/filtersc_style_macro_play_attempt_with_protoss/
