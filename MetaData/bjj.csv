It feels heavy around my waist.  I feel not ready and accomplished all at the same time, all the friendships I've made all the time I've spent on the matt.  I also felt a small sense of loss and nostalgia as I hung my brown belt up in my home gym next to my white, blue, purple and medals.

I've learned through this all that jiu jitsu is an individual journey that differs for each person

I started Jiu Jitsu in my early 30's, was about 280 pounds and very strong.  I knew it would be challenging, but thought I could still throw people around or hold my own.  The first time I sparred it was with about a 150 pound purple belt.  He kept me on my back, unable to move, and of course submitted me at will, with the ease of a parent holding down a misbehaving, squirming child.  I instantly knew there was something to the sport, competed a lot, sometimes 6 times a week, about year and a half at blue

What inspires me in the sport, is the white belt who sticks with it.  Who struggles, who persists, who has the faith in the system, his partners and professors, his body and his innate ability and keeps coming back.  I remember back to myself at this time, how hard it was, brown belt, to stick with it

I was proud to get my black belt

to those just starting out, positive attitude, patience, trust in your instructors and training partners, read and study and eventually forge your own path to where you feel comfort and at home with the sport.  That black belt will be there waiting for you in time.

1369751931.0,1f78iy,"For those going to the Worlds, the vast majority of you will lose, but you are no stepping stone, you're a whet stone. My experience at the 2011 Pan Ams.",Im_From_Da_Streets,24, or late.  Being a lightweight I was the first of our group to compete and when we got there the feather weights were already underway.  The arena was filled with twelve rings of mats all filled with competitors. People shouting, I had a division with over 120 competitors meaning seven rounds to the finals.  It was a huge challenge; this was the Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Pan Am. 

 As soon I had hurriedly put on my gi the announcer was calling my bracket to the warm up area.  Inside this fenced off pen gathered all of the guys in my division, and singing along to gangster rap as it blared from head phones.  We were all here to send each other home but were first forced into a tiny area with almost no room to do our intended warm ups.  After a rush of claustrophobia I sat on the floor, closed my eyes, and meditated on my affirmations.  ‘Everyone else here thinks they’re the good guy, so I’ll be the bad guy.  I’m like Darth Vader so I wear my black gi.  I’m here to ruin someone’s day.  I am the bad draw they didn’t want’.  I waited so long I began considering that they must have forgotten to call me when I finally heard my name.

As I weighed in and got my gi checked, I didn’t know where my friends were and my coach Comprido was away at the UFC in Las Vegas.  Standing there in the weight ins, I started to run through my mind all the excuses I could use after I lose this match, when in the corner of my eye I saw Andre Galvao, one of my biggest heroes.  “Andre” I yelled, “I’m a big fan” he turned around, looked back at and grabbed me by the shoulder.  “Yes” was all he said then walked away but it completely hit a reset button on my train of thought.  I’m not here to lose this match

In every first match of every tournament I’ve ever done I get hit by what’s called the adrenaline dump.  You lose sense of time, ‘breathe, relax your grips’.  Once I swept my opponent and got on top I felt him start to panic.  This wasn’t supposed to happen to him, but then again he pulled the bad guy in the first round.  I used a lot of energy holding him down as he kicked like a wild deer but I eventually passed his guard, winning the match on points.  With the first one behind me I returned to the still crowded warm up area with a new comfort and focus.  Now it was time to get in the zone.

Right away when the next match started I could feel my opponent nervously shaking.  He probably got a buy and this was his first match of the day.  As the bad guy, forcing him to tap.  

During the third fight I lost points when I got swept and had to use my reserve flexibility to get out of more trouble.  I realized that my opponent was one tough guy.  While I hung in there, this being my first big tournament.  Everyone would realize that guy was just better than me.  I thought that till out of nowhere, I heard my friend Bruce from the stands ‘One minute left’.  That made me move.  If only it had been two minutes I would have thought it was too long and quit, but I could push in this last minute and make something happen.  The next time he tried to step around my legs, I followed him and rolled upside down.  My legs landed right how they needed to be to step up triangle choke but it seemed like he didn’t realized or know the danger.  I took a deep breath and unwound, cinching a deep triangle choke.  Grabbing my ankle, I squeezed and got the submission from the trick move

In the warm up pen my friends were waiting.  They were all excited for how I was doing while I kept it inside.  If I won one more match I would be farther in at a big tournament than any of the Americans on our team had gone.  ‘One match at a time’ I told them, so I started pretending to practice judo throws were he could see.  As soon as the match started I showed my bluff and immediately pulled him into a deep half guard, a place a wrestler type like him would feel confused.  After a sweep, I snuck to his back and cranked a bow and arrow choke.  My friends cheered from their distant seats in the stands.  I was now deep in the no-man’s land of the late tournament that was unknown to everyone I knew; that is everyone except for Comprido.

After about an hour break I fought this kid in the quarter finals that had a really similar game to mine.  The entire match I felt like I had no control but it was still somehow close.  I swept him, and hence the medaling round, was next.

I focused on my affirmations.  ‘You are meant to be here.  You trained hard for this.  You were already one of the best in the room before the day began.  And you still are.’  I was already in third place no matter what

The next guy came out strong, I had never done it before.  I had never done any of this before but I had faked my way this far.  But I had to focus; I had a chance to take this whole thing.  Luckily the submission was quick and I still had a lot of gas left.

In the other semi final that would decide my opponent, it was none other the Saulo Ribiero, the former Michael Jordan of jiu jitsu.  I had studied Saulo’s book on the plane out to California.  So great, he has a hall of famer for a coach.  But I knew I was always dangerous.
Back to my affirmations before the finals ‘Everyone else here looks like a fool.  They wear their gi like it’s a Halloween costume and pajamas.  I was reborn on a beach in Brazil in this gi.  My gi is still covered in blood

It was one of the quicker fights of my career.  Within ten seconds I was flipped in the air onto my back.  Twenty seconds later he picked me up, mounted triangle, and an armbar for several breaths I had to tap to a combination of the above.  The kid simply out classed me.  If I drew him in the first round he would have beat me then too.  When I realized he still had braces on his teeth I asked him how old he was, 17.  This was his day, and it turns out it was the first of many others for him.  This second place was the best I ever got.  I shook his hand and slinked off the mat. 

I was sitting there on the ground in a daze when Saulo walked up to me.  He told me that I fought well and that I had a lot of talent.  He knew my name and gave me a lot of respect.  He was so humble to even talk to me and I was honored to meet him.

Standing on the second step of the podium, I will make damn sure that they are sharper than me.  I may not win every tournament I enter, I may never win a match again but I will keep going out there because I’m no stepping stone, I’m a whet stone.

But I didn't care that I sucked. For me

After getting my blue belt, I don't bemoan it or beat myself up.

Why? Because I'm not going to class to be The Best Jiu Jitsu Woman Ever. I'm not even going to class to be The Best Blue Belt. I'm not going to class to Become a Purple Belt. I'm going to class to do jiu jitsu, stay active and have a healthy lifestyle. So every time I go to class, I win! Every time some strong 21 year old white belt crushes me, I still win. Even on days when I want to kick someone, I still win.

I also compare myself with myself. Do I move more smoothly? Was I able to do a certain move better? Was I able to identify when to use a move? Does my rolling feel more cohesive? So even though my jiu jitsu isn't that great

Perhaps being ""realistic"" isn't the best trait - I recognize that if I cared more about being The Best Blue Belt or if I started competing that my mental game would kick in and I would very likely progress faster or work harder. But it's okay. I'm so thankful to just get on the mats. I'm so thankful that I am active and not going to die of a heart attack. I'm so thankful that I'm down to 149 lbs. I'm so thankful that I'm putting stress on my body and bones so that when I'm an old woman I will not break a hip because I fell down.

The cool thing about jiu jitsu - I'll be doing it for the rest of my life. Even though I suck now, 15 years, I will be better than I am now. 

I have a very long term view of things. That's why I've never really minded that my jiu jitsu wasn't great.",self,t5_2qn02,False,,blue-belt-4,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/bjj/comments/124sqh/why_ive_never_really_minded_that_my_jiu_jitsu/

1370349422.0,1fnbzg,I am the 2013 Blue Belt Ultraheavy World Champ AMA (went from overweight video game nerd to MMA and BJJ athlete),arkimler,140,23,121,"Roughly three years ago around my 20th birthday I decided to start working out after 20 years of sitting on my ass

After I got in decent shape (3 months of working out) I decided to try BJJ because my uncle (who is a blue belt and had been training for 6 years at the time) suggested I try it if I want to do a combat sport. I honestly wanted to try a stand-up art like Muay Thai and at one point I almost joined a boxing gym

The harder and more I worked towards getting my technique and physical shape better the more motivated I became. I became obsessed with BJJ just like I was with video games. But this was something more... There was something about the competition aspect that really made me feel alive.

My first competition (Houston Open 2011) I was a young

Fast forward to my next tournament. It was a more realistic local tournament to participate in. I ended up winning my first match in Nogi but unable to finish. My instructor at the time gave me some discouraging words after the match because I couldn't finish the guy with a keylock because I again brain farted. This really lit a fire under my ass and frankly pissed me off. I ended up losing the next match in Nogi. But then I came back in Gi and won 3 matches to win Gold. It was one of the best feelings I had in awhile. I realized after that day I wanted to perform and compete in BJJ at the highest level.

Some issues happened with my previous gym (which I'm not going to get into) and a close friend convinced me to try out another academy in the same area (this was a year into my BJJ career). The instructors already knew who I was because I trained there a couple days to try them out. I didn't know how close I'd be now to these new people I just started training with.

After decisively winning a local tournament and a grapplers quest my instructor promoted me to blue (about 14 months training). I was stoked and ready to compete at this new level. Again I got beat numerous times until I started winning at blue.

The reason I got into BJJ was for MMA and I wasn't about to give up on that. I trained all the time for MMA and I begged my instructor to set up an MMA fight for me. He did and I started training for a fight (8 months after I was promoted) and the first two fights fell through and didn't happen. But my third fight camp happened and I won in under a minute with a KO. I was extremely excited and it felt like all my hard work is finally paying off after two failed fight camps. This was last April.

After the fight I bought a plane ticket to LA and signed up for Worlds. This was my first big tournament so I knew that I shouldn't be too hard on myself if I lost. The experience in California was amazing. I was with some of my best friends and we got to see some cool stuff and overall the trip just without competition was really fun. But the reason that we went there wasn't to site see

The day of Worlds I remember the mutual feeling of our group. My friends and I were on the outside easygoing but we were excited and nervous on the inside. In the early morning most of my teammates competed. I was super nervous just watching them. It was disappointing watching my friends lose their first round and more disappointing seeing them afterwards. I felt helpless watching them from the sidelines. I knew that there was a reason we came to Long Beach and I wanted to prove something to my friends, and watching my friends compete and lose tough matches in their first round made me more inspired to do well because of the step up in competition.

It seemed like it took forever for me to compete. At close to 6 pm I stepped on the mat against a Brazilian Checkmat competitor. I wasn't intimidated by his school. I didn't care. I knew I worked too hard to this point to be intimidated by petty shit. I pulled guard and armbarred him in less than a minute. 

My next opponent got injured previously so he had to back out so I got a lucky bye. Next match I went up against a smaller Ultra heavy weight from Colombia

I knew if I didn't give up I had the potential to achieve gold. The next match I had was against a HUGE Mongolian dude in the semifinals. He weighed over 400 pounds and made me look small (I'm 6'7 and 240). He thought he couldn't be arm barred and blatantly just gave me his arm which I snatched onto like a spider monkey and popped. I was ecstatic because this match put me into the finals.

Probably the hardest match I had that day was the finals. Rewatching my finals match with my instructor coaching me from his laptop still gives me goosebumps. The guy I went up against was the favorite to win worlds at my level. He medalled 3 times in Gi Pan Ams and the last two times he medalled it was gold. It was a very close match.

I knew from other competitors that he had a good deep half game which is uncharacteristic of a heavyweight so I took that into account. At the start of the match he pulled half guard and tried to get deep half but I got a deep underhook and crossface and didn't let him underhook my leg for deep half. I tried to pass and open his legs but it wasn't working and we were at a stalemate. The ref gave me a disadvantage for stalling and I knew I had to move. As soon as I moved he swept me from deep half and he ended up in my full guard. My guard is the best part of my game so I felt safe but at the same time I was down 2 with 3 minutes left. I started attacking with triangles but he was able to posture out of them. 

With about 1 and a half minutes left he was about to pass my guard when I saw an opening for an arm bar. I used my flexibility to go belly down and attack the arm. I felt like I might not get it so I had to get points. I transitioned to the back and got my 4 points with under a minute left. He got out of the back after I nearly RNC'd him and we got to our feet. He tried to take me down but I was able to stop him until time ran out. I ended up winning on points 4-2.

This was an experience and a feeling that I could not describe. It's still hard picturing myself as a world champ only 2 and a half years into my BJJ career

Our little community (can I still call it little?) has been growing at a faster and faster pace and that has been reflected in the amount of quality content that has been showing up on a daily basis. We now have several well known black belts posting on a regular basis and taking the time to interact and answer questions (Thank you!). 

New people to the art have had their questions answered regularly. Now, people still take the time to answer questions which means this subreddit hasn't become ""calloused"" over the years.

It wasn't until I became a moderator last year that I realized just how little moderation is done here. *Very* few posts are removed as a result of the ""hands off"" moderation motto. The up/downvote system does its job well and rarely will threads devolve into shouting contests. Really

In short

Instead of posting ""congratulations"" sentiment below

four years ago my girlfriend was killed in a car accident (that escalated quickly, waiting until were were out of school to move forward. six months later, one of my best friends committed suicide. I didn't know how to cope with life or deal with anything. my grades slipped, going from a 4.2 GPA taking AP classes and doing college prep, to a 1.8. I simply didn't want to do anything. I also stopped being active and gained about 30 pounds over the following years until college.

fast forward to college: I withdrew from a couple of classes my first semester, and introduced me to videos of the sport, and brought me to his gym to watch a few times. i've always been involved in competitive things, loved strategy games, I used to be a huge starcraft player, i've played dota for years, and I love chess and shogi. needless to say, but I couldn't motivate myself to get a job to pay for classes -- that was two years ago.

fast forward to summer 2012 -- I joined my first bjj academy under EJ Ledesma

this sport has literally altered my reality, and I have shredded any self-delusions I had about life, stopped feeling sorry for myself, and have begun *living life*. 

I don't think i've seen any posts in /r/bjj since i've been subscribed like this, depressed, heavy smokers and drinkers, people who have felt down on themselves/world is against them, and it has since motivated them to continue with their education and move forward in life.

the ability to come on here and see discussions, but it's a comfortable level of activity with relatively good content. it has it's moments, but otherwise, it's a nice place to communicate with other people who practice as well. so when I see people bashing others for getting promoted, getting stripes, it really irritates me that, in addition to it bothering you, and reply about how you disagree with it. if you don't like the thread, because there are some people who, don't bash it. when someone in your gym gets a promotion

After class was over, and how he's actually a better No-Gi fighter. My instructor (black belt) talked to him about the merits of both and how he thinks Gi is a good overall Jiu Jitsu to learn as well.

This is when things got weird. The kid CHALLENGED my instructor to roll no-gi with him. My instructor kinda laughed and said ""Yeah we can do that

My instructor seemed annoyed, my instructor bumped him in such a way that the kid's knee got tweaked real bad. The rolling ended immediately and the kid practically crawled off the mat. Now, I can't say for sure that it was on purpose, but my instructor had absolutely 0 regrets afterwards.

I don't think he'll be coming back for a few weeks

&gt;What does a belt in Jiu-Jitsu mean? I've been asked some form of this question a lot lately. Like one person told me they did not feel they deserved the belt they were given

&gt;The truth is: THERE IS NO UNIVERSAL STANDARD IN JIU-JITSU FOR WHAT ANY BELT IS! It is completely based on your instructor and even with the same instructor

&gt;Sometimes these standards are based on performance like placing well in tournaments or if someone is able to submit a certain level of their training partners in training. Sometimes the standards are based on having a certain level of knowledge so a test might be given. Sometimes the standard is based on the amount of classes attended assuming that after a person has attended a certain amount of classes then they should have a certain level of knowledge. 

&gt;One of the experiences I had that really made me start to think about what a belt means and who deserves one was after a brown belt test done by Rickson for 8 guys probably around 2008-2009. Rickson rewarded all 8 guys with their brown belts even though I was there and helping to grade and I felt about half the guys failed the test. Afterward I asked him why he gave the belts to one of the guys that I thought had failed and he told me this. This guy was 50 years old had been training consistently for years once a week, was excellent at making tiny adjustments to defend so he was tough to tap out but had almost no offense at all. He didn't have a huge arsenal of techniques and wasn't necessarily smooth at all either, what I thought would kind of be the standards for a brown belt, those were the standards I felt I was held to. Rickson however made me realize not everyone has the potential to reach the same level but everyone has the potential to become a black belt with hard work, persistence and dedication.

&gt;If you think about it, some guys are stronger, some guys are heavier, some guys have great guards some have great defense, some guys have great mounts or cross-sides, but even with twins their skill level and performance will be different.

&gt;So my message to you all is do not worry about the color of your belt, if you put the time in the belts will all eventually come.",,False,self,t5_2qn02,False,blue-belt,

I am a 165 lb female, especially in a local park that features some heavily wooded areas with challenging trails. Sometimes later in the evening these trails can be pretty deserted and I won't see anyone else on the trail for miles. I know it is dangerous, but I like to listen to music while running. I know it makes me less aware of my surroundings, but it really helps me maintain a good pace. 

I was running close to dusk earlier this week, when a pretty big guy comes barreling around a blind turn and we collide. I lost my footing and crashed pretty hard. Luckily, I have been training BJJ for a couple of years now, so I tucked and rolled over my shoulder and walked away without a scratch. My ipod wasn't even damaged. The other runner apologized profusely and we all went on our merry way. 

Thanks BJJ.

I am 6'4 and started at 360+ and am currently 235** 

I can’t tell you how heavy I was at my heaviest. Every scale I have ever owned would show an E after 360lbs or the needle would scrape against the top of the scale depressingly.   The first time I ever discovered low carb dieting when I was 19 it took 3 months before I hit the sub 360lb mark
The last time I could remember being thin I was in the 1st grade but by the 3rd I was already the fat kid

Here are a few random before pictures at various weights

I had yo-yoed for years.   The lowest I had ever hit at the time was 287lbs but I would mostly bounce between 300 and 350.  I tried it all from diet pills to prescription diet pills to every as seen on tv work out device.  I have my bow-flex coat rack and I’ve thrown my obligatory $100 bucks at the big box gym personal trainer racket.  Nothing worked for me. 

 On  November 19th 2008, then make it to my desk and sit for 8 hours at a computer only to go home and sit and watch some tv.  Realistically the longest point of any given day that I’d be standing was while showering. 

I was 342lbs at the time and I decided to make a change.  I did something I had wanted to do for 15 years ever since I saw Royce Gracie at UFC 1 and took up Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.  I started November 22nd 2 days later.  Since that day I have not gained weight to any significant degree
I joined C-Quence Jiu-Jitsu, but not one person gave me even the slightest bit of grief for it.  For anyone who’s ever done any sort of grappling they will attest to how physically exhausting it is, but I fucking loved it.  Not only was the sport itself but it was the people there, people my own age who were just as horrible but loved it just as much.

For me the social aspect, and when I wasn’t around for a day or two people would ask where you were at.  I was able to lose 70lbs in almost a year and without even trying it seemed.  I would go to BJJ and eat like shit after, never before though to avoid puking.  I still had alcohol a couple night a week, but the weight came off like it was nothing.  But at the 270s I stalled but I didn’t think too much of it, I was still losing just very slowly.  It was competition that made me make the additional changes I needed.

Here is me in the blue at the 2011 AZ international open

At white belt I had won almost every tournament I entered save for the worlds.  I was bigger than most of my opponents and I have the gift of super mutant flexibility, and enlisted my friend from BJJ, well call him Travis since that’s his name,  who is a personal trainer focused on fitness specifically for BJJ.  I got better, I used every tournament as a goal.  They kept me focused and I started to do better, a couple bronzes, a couple silvers

1317648643.0,kzbrv,I'm Gay and do BJJ. Would you roll with me? ,defenastration2000,109,20,292,"Quick clarification: This isn't a request

I am gay, if I trained more regularly, maybe I'd already have one, who knows). The gym is quite a large one, and is very well known globally, though for reasons that should be apparent I'm not going to say which one. 

On other websites dedicated to jiujitsu and grappling arts, they'll all suddenly contract HIV. I personally think both of these are ridiculous, but nonetheless they are prevailing points of view that also seem to be quite common in the gym itself. It's rare to hear a conversation about gay people from the people in the gym, but sometimes it DOES happen, and it makes me very glad that I have kept my classmates in the dark about my sexuality (I am very much ""out"" in every other aspect of my life). 

Essentially, and pose a few questions to you guys: 

- If you knew I was gay

- If the answer was yes, albeit safely. I'm curious about the views based not just on the strange fear of gay men carrying around infinite STDs, but also potentially on the idea that a single gay man would be a ""sexual threat"") 

- If you were to find out that I go to your academy, or any other gay man without your knowledge (Considering the gyms I have visited, and that mine is a rather large one, there's probably at least a few guys on here I have rolled with), what would your thoughts on the subject be? This question is for anyone, but particularly aimed at those who feel uncomfortable rolling with gay males. 

- What are your thoughts on Gay men in jiujitsu as a whole? 

Also: feel free to AMAA.

Being the only child of a single mother this threw me into an incredible tailspin.  I tried several types of therapy, unhelped and therefore unhealed.  Until Jiu Jitsu. 

 I saw a ""Brazilian Jiu Jitsu"" sign while out driving (I believe it was on Macarthur Blvd for you Okies) and wondered if it was that ""Gracie Jiu Jitsu"" stuff I saw in the UFC.  It took me months to work up the courage to actually go in.  I literally thought I was gonna have to put on gloves

I went in, but they were both Jiu Jitsu Gods to me.  Sr had these crazy Butterfly hooks I could never get around.  For me in the sport of Jiu Jitsu I finally found something that scratched that certain itch that no other therapy,exercise, sport etc that I tried could touch.  Still to this day no matter how bad a day I've had, I can get lost in it.

I moved to Boulder, Eliot Marshall among many other great training partners and friends. I still love how BJJ creates strong bonds of friendship.

I moved to Brazil in 2005 and trained at Gracie Barra (and a couple other places) for about 2 years.  I got my brown belt from Carlos Gracie Jr.  I moved back and got my black belt from Amal Easton in July of '09. Matt Jubera and I opened Dark Horse BJJ January 2010. 
http://bjjdarkhorse.com/

Being large, and unusually stubborn I was a terrible student of Jiu Jitsu for a long time.  ""If it doesn't work do it again, HARDER"", was one of my mottos.  Also, ""F@#k you I'm not gonna tap"" (until the bitter edge of unconsciousness/injury).  Sooo wrong headed.  So I was walking around with multiple injuries all at the same time for a while until it finally dawned on me that there had to be another way.  I had to learn to lighten up and get back to having fun training again.  I also had to set about **learning** Jiu Jitsu.  Not just showing up to class and training. These days I probably spend roughly equal time drilling and training, and there is no magic formula for the correct ratio, but I think most people **really** neglect drilling.
 
**The Dude's Top 7**
A few words of advice.  You may have heard this all before

#1 Drill Baby Drill - Any technical shortcomings in your game can be filled here.  Basically ANY game not based on a physical attribute (aka flexibility, De La Riva, etc those are all guard games but  whatever. Let me say that again.  If you drill it enough you will be able to perform it in training (on a long enough timeline, given certain parameters blahblahblah).  Whether or not it is the game best suited to you/what you need to learn is another question entirely.  Granted someone has to show it to you, which brings me to... 

#2 Start and maintain a Jiu Jitsu Journal.  You have a black belt instructor?  Awesome.  When he teaches class write that shit down.  Pretend your life depends on you remembering what the f@$^ he is telling you

#3 Dunno what you need to work on? A simple way to get better is this; Pay attention to where you get stuck.  Keep getting stuck in side control? A#1 is go back to drilling the SC escapes your Professor taught you.  Ask him what he does when someone does x (that thing they are doing that is giving you trouble).  But be specific.  Look up SC escapes on youtube - check sources great competitors generally give good technique

#4 Learn a ""Game"" not a move.  ""A game is 3 or more moves that play off each other.""-Jay Jack  Lets take Spider Guard for example.  Spider Guard is a game.  There are Entrances aka how to get to SpiderG.  Methods of control, etc.
My friend Brandon Mullins said, **shut down**.  Plan accordingly.

#5 Stay healthy.  BJJ is a marathon

#6 Flow Train.  When I said I still ""get lost in it
 
#7 Are you serious about becoming the best? Then THINK about your game.  Build a [mind map](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map) for your game

I figured I'd post a little bio/information in order to make it a bit different from other promotion threads.  Perhaps other could follow suit so the threads have more content and spur discussion.

1)  How old are you?  How much do you weigh?  

	I'm 36 years old and compete at middle weight.

2)  How long have you been training and how often do you train?  

	I've been training for 4.5 years and for the past year

3) Have you done any other sports or martial arts that have helped your jiu jitsu?

	Nope.

4)  What the best aspect of your game and why?

	I'm good at playing the various open guards, spider guard, x-guard, 
	and switching between them to sweep.   My best submissions is the bow and arrow choke.

5) What is the worst aspect of your game?

	My closed guard not dangerous and I'm working improving it.  

6) Do you compete?  How often?
	
	I compete about 4-6 times per year and I try to do the major local tournaments.

7) What the main reason you train i.e. self defense, fitness, etc.?

	I train for fun

8)  Have you had any major injuries due to BJJ?

	A tore my LCL and hamstring tendon.  I had to have surgery and I was out for 6 months.

9)  Do you do any training or exercise outside of jiu jitsu?

	As a tournament approaches
	I also did a bit of Judo in order to improve my standup game but I had to quit due to the 
	injury mentioned above.

10)  Do you have any tips or advice that have helped you in your jiu jitsu journey?

	I follow the approach of learning 2 techniques from each position.  Once those are committed 
	to muscle memory
	that I'm working on.  This really helps me to develop an 'A' game

I pulled into knee-shield guard to start the roll and was controlling the position and tempo pretty well even though I could feel with his insistance (and elbows in my eye socket) he was hunting for a tap from this blue belt.

1. MAKE EVERY ROLL FEEL LIKE THE FINALS AT MMUNDIAL
	ALWAYS bring your A game. unless your roll hard all the time you arent progressing

2. DONT BOTHER WASHING YOUR GI
	In fact

3. ALWAYS LEAVE YOUR GI PANTS AT HOME
	Grapple in your top and shorts. Sambo style! when you do that dont fotget to grab the other guys pant legs for all your passes.

4. ALWAYS BEAT DOWN NEW GUYS.		
	That way they know the power of BJJ right away. They need to know how effective it is.

5. IF YOU KNOW A COOL COUNTER TO WHAT THE TEACHER IS SHOWING BE SURE TO SHOW IT RIGHT AWAY
 	Especialy when the instructor is talking. That way you can look cool. By the way

6. ALWAYS USE FULL RESISTANCE IN CLASS.
	Especially when in learning stage. If your partner is learning an armbar for the first time you need to give them full resistance so that they know how that feels. Dont let the get it!

7. IF YOU ARE ABOUT TO GET SUBBED SWITCH INTO COACH MODE.
	Coach your partner through the rest of the technique. That way you get credit for HIS sub.

8. IF YOU GET TIRED IN A ROLL WAIT UNTIL YOU IN A BAD POSITION TO STOP

9. WHEN YOU GET TAPPED BY A BIGGER GUY ALWAYS TELL THEM AFTER THE ROLL ""DANG YOU ARE STRONG!""
	That way you can blame their win on their strength instead of their technique

10. KEEP TRACK OF EVERYONE YOU TAPPED
	relive those moments with your classmates before every class

11. GUN AFTER EVERYONE WHO IS A HIGHER RANK THAN YOU
	That way you can put on your belt for tapping out a higher belt

12. WHEN YOU GET A TAP IMMEDIATLY JUMP UP AND DO A VICTORY DANCE
	Make sure everyone in the room knows

13. DROP IN AND OUT OF CLASS AS YOU SEE FIT
	dont bother to do the warm ups. if the material dosent look cool to you be sure to pull your buddy out of the class and grapple on the side of the mat while class is going on. Always do this if the class is covering something youve learned already. Review is for white belts.

14. ALONG THOSE SAME LINGS
	that way you dont have to even bother with the warm ups

15. WHEN YOU HAVE VISITOR IN FROM ANOTHER GYM YOU MUST PUT A BEAT DOWN ON THEM.
	thats the only way they will know how good your gym is. It is your job to uphold the reputation of the gym.

16. NOBODY MINDS IF YOUR ROLL WITH OPEN SORES.
	go ahead and grind that scab in my face. I dont mind at all.

17.LONG FINGERNAILS ARE A GREAT SPARRING WEAPON
	dont cut them. Toenails either

18. SMALL JOINT LOCKS ARE YOUR SECRET WEAPON
	grab and twist fingers. Do it hard and fast.

19. DONT TAP!
	Dosent matter if that arm is totally straight and you can hear tendons ripping. You might still get out! your pride is worth it.

20. SLAM ON ALL SUBMISSIONS HARD AND FAST!
	That way you get twice as many. Dosnt matter your partner wont have time to tap until its too late. This is bjj

21. REFUSE TO WARM UP WITH TEAM MATES BEFORE A TOURNAMENT
	helping others in your gym is for sissies. Besides

22. wHEN WORKING WITH A PARTNER ON DRILLS
	You have to make sure you get your reps in! One good way of doing this is to ""forget"" to, just tell them your bust watching other people.

23. ALSO WHEN DRILLING
	or to interupt two people who are working to start a conversation with one of them. jiu jitsu is for socializing

24. MAKE SURE TO CONSTANTLY CORRECT WHEN YOU PARTNERS IS DOING
	They'll appreciate the advance guidance

25. WHEN YOU'RE DRILLING NEW STUFF WITH A PARTNER, OR PUT YOUR BELT ON/ STRAIGHTEN YOUR GI.
	better to use up their drilling time for stuff like that,False,self,t5_2qn02,1366770717.0,,blue-belt-2,t3_1cza56

&gt;I was wondering if it would be possible to request a ""no-meme"" policy in /r/bjj - perhaps canvasing the subscribers first. If you check /r/theoryofreddit and similar subreddits there is a wealth of evidence showing that the meme-isation of subreddits tends to kill them

Meme posts tend to get a lot of upboats (and downboats) and the comments are either banal jokes or complaints about memes. I tend to dislike and downvote them

Many of you have probably noticed we've got a guy who has been banned a bunch of times for posting gay porn gifs while complaining about /r/bjj being soft crybaby white belts. What's funny to me is that I would be up for discussing the state of this subreddit with him if he used a few less dudes blowing each other.

People have been wondering what happened to TOTM. I tried to revive it when I first became a mod, and even shot instructional videos. Despite all that, at best we got someone like UncleSkippy making one big good post (thanks!), and a few people just asking simple questions with discussion ending 2-3 days later. Not quite worth all the planning and effort.

So tell me how do you feel about...

So, because I had felt dumb even asking about it and after a few exchanges with commenters I realized that I was talking out of my ass. I wish I had left it, if nothing else but as a reminder to myself to remain humble.

Basically, now) However, my instructor was a black-belt judoka and obviously couldn't promote me in BJJ, so I was wondering if I could pop by another gym, test, and walk out with a blue. I was cruising through guys at my gym and had had some success at competitions (a gold and two bronzes in three tournaments). Mind you, again, and thought it was time. 

Boy, I have had a lot of realizations and have made some changes. I realized that the gym I was training at was kind of a sham. Not at the fault of my instructor- he taught me a lot of good techniques. And I'm realizing that he almost never called our class a ""Jiu Jitsu"" class. He was very careful to call it a ""grappling"" class. The owner of the gym, however, was quite eager to advertise it as BJJ, I'm sure to bring in the money of people who are none-the-wiser (like myself). After a few bad experiences with said owner, I decided to leave. I ghosted the place, telling only my instructor and a few other students that I had become good friends with that I was going to leave. My instructor, as it turns out, but still keep up with no-gi. I really focused on finding a legitimate gym with a solid reputation and history. Enter Gracie Barra.

*Talk about getting thrown into a tank of sharks.* Nice sharks, and is populated with dudes and chicks with belts of all colors. I am much more respectful of the ~~sport~~ art, and I've realized how wrong I was just a few months ago. 

I have since determined that I am not- I repeat **NOT** ready for a blue belt. I have also determined that I am not the one who determines *when* or *if* I am ready for a blue belt or stripes. I am proud to now


I guess the morals of my experience are these: 

* No-gi grappling **=/=** BJJ.
* You don't ""earn"" promotions just by showing up.
* Promotions aren't that important anyway. It's about learning and just getting better. The comment from my old post that really stuck with me was a quote someone left from Royce Gracie: ""A belt only covers two inches of your ass and the rest you need to back up on your own.”
* Training at a gym with a legitimate reputation is really
* I am a moron for thinking I was ready for a blue belt.

So

Edit: I started training under a blue belt, it wasn't long before the weight began to drop and I am at 165 now.  I quickly fell in love with this sport, more so for the self esteem boost and  social aspect at first.  

I ended out growing the first school and began to train with his instructor, with odd hours, in Tampa I had to switch school to Gracie Tampa.  GT is a very MMA orient school with a good amount of pro fighter(Matt Arroyo, Marcus Jones, Allen Barubee, Corey Hill, Brandon Sene).  After Matt Arroyo moved out to start his own school, but quickly realized that it was great choice thanks to his teaching/training style and desire to roll with his students every class.  I now teach a good amount if the morning classes at Gracie Tampa South and am very happy here. 

I competed a lot as a white and blue

*update number DUCE!!!* adding some more pictures of what it looks like on me. The Grey one is the Gi im giving away. The white one is a ShoYoRoll and the black is a Ronin. As you can see it runs bigger then most. I wear a L tshirt and 34 x 30 pants (32-33 if I've cut weight) the pants are way bigger then I like and the length is more of a 32 or 34. These are very nice light weight gi's with rip-stop pants. lets find somebody this will fit nicely!!!

So my family and I were at a bar in Austin for SXSW when a couple of dudes come up to my 17 year old cousin and grab her wrists, dudes, not this one, but good luck on the next."" You know, trying to be cool. Well, we start walking away and the guys start talking shit and then one of them flips me off. This is when I see a blur fly past me- it's my brother- and he tackles this guy down, beating the crap out of him.

Without thinking, who is a considerable distance away mind you, so I am able to get an underhook, grip his shoulder, get my forearm under his jaw, and with my foot behind his, turn my body and prop him squarely against the wall. He was pinned and confused

Too be honest, and details are a bit fuzzy. Not to mention, I might not have gotten involved if I wasn't inebriated, but who doesn't stick up for family? All I do know is that I felt my body respond so naturally to the situation, I was feeling complete control. I knew immediately I was the most dangerous person in that bar, the strongest (although, again

1. The seminar mat space was waaayyyyyy too small. It was like sardines in a can. There was a whole bunch of space surronding the seminar mat space that they could have used to lay down more mats.
2. They should have also improved the seminars by putting up big screen tvs or projectors and having a camera crew film the instructor as he was giving instructions. Instead
3. I was hoping to see more vendors there, and etc...?
4. We were hoping to pick up some gear/dvds on discount from the vendors who were there
5. They should have put up more stands for the audience
6. They needed more security on hand
7. People from the bleacher threw water bottles at the people who snuck on the mats. People in the stand actually ended up BOO-ing because of the people who snuck onto the mat.
8. Unprofessional - You can actually see a little boy running around during the [Cooper vs. Schembri match](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpiVOQUrmUI). It's not too distracting when you watch the video
9. Watching the videos at home on FREE YouTube now is 100x better than watching it there standing. You can make out every single detail. We couldn't even see what happened at the end of the Glover vs. Terra match because the people who snuck on the mats stood up and blocked our way.
10. Main event was a no show!

Overall, and was not worth our time. I would not go to another one for a very long time.

So, and my life off the mat.

Its fair to say that right from the beginning

That full time obsession continued for about 16 months until very recently

Just before I found BJJ, very little chrome.  All business.  Its maybe my 6th motorcycle, but its my favorite by far.  I have been riding for 12 years, on the track and off.  I have slayed the dragon, I have race trained with the California Superbike School, I even went down once but wasn't injured due to wearing a lot of gear and some luck.

But BJJ...it pushed everything else out of my life.  That brand new bike that took third place in a motorcycle show when I first got it...it sat in my garage with a thick layer of dust.

It wasn't the only hobby that got pushed out of my life:  I had no money or time to go shooting (gun enthusiast).  I had no time to play videogames which used to be my go-to stress reliever after a hard day at work.  I had no time to turn a wrench on my motorcycle.

But it was more than that....it wasn't just that I was lacking time for those other things, and I didn't feel that I needed it anymore to relieve my stress...after all I had rolling for that.

I even talked for a while about selling my motorcycle because I was afraid that I might go down again and ruin my knee or something

I did all the normal white belt shit.  I got obsessed with getting my blue belt for a while.  I learned way too many techniques before focusing on my basics (technique collection is good but it can be a distraction from the most important stuff!).

I competed and lost.  I competed and won.  I got a few shiny medals and the door to my spare bedroom (now fully matted and nicknamed ""the danger room"" in an homage to my favorite band of mutants) now clanks when I close it.  I have more Gis than I really should own also

I had put all of my proverbial eggs in only ONE basket.

Recently though, and brown belts.  I am the nail now, but in the fundamentals class I was the hammer most of the time.  I actually like being the nail more than the hammer, but that is a whole other post.

I started to look at these purple belts and get to know them.  They train hard

Something in my brain clicked recently.  I started asking myself if I could maintain the pace I currently have

I think this idea of BJJ being a marathon

I'm back on the bike.  I'm rekindling old friendships that got pushed back when I found BJJ.  I'm planning to go shooting again soon (man ammo is pricey these days).  

Here is the amazing part:  By letting these other interests back into my life...the result has been amazing.  I ENJOY TRAINING MORE.  I enjoy BJJ more.  A bad day on the mat doesn't kill me anymore because I have other things in my life that bring me happiness.

Yeah, but get more out of my mat time and still continue to progress at a nice pace.  I'm also, somehow, rolling much better also.  I'm more relaxed and less focused on some goal.  I think maybe, just maybe I'm starting to understand how to flow.  It feels like a kind of joyful apathy if that makes any sense.  I'm happier to care just a little bit less.

If you are in that stage where BJJ has pushed everything non-BJJ out of your life:  My humble advice is to try and diversify your life a bit.  Rekindle those old relationships.  Get back into an old hobby you used to love before grappling pushed it aside.  Maybe even spend a bit less time on the mats.

I think I have finally found the right balance between dedication and obsession

1361080181.0,18ohmz,Why you should train no-gi...,TheRumblePak,67,15,50,"I've been a no-gi promoter at my school for years now. At my blue and purple belt promotions

Most people at my school don't like no-gi and the class size has decreased over the years since I have joined. Attendance has decreased to the point where the remaining no-gi stalwarts have been relegated to taking their classes on the alternate mats. The new students don't seem to like no-gi and the advanced students have fallen away from it as time has gone by. 

My appeal to BJJ guys is to not neglect no-gi. Now I fully admit to being biased because I prefer it to the gi but I make every effort to do gi classes as well because of that old adage

Why you should do no-gi:

1. Your leglock game will improve a lot faster by doing no-gi. One of the reasons why this doesn't translate to the gi game is because you can defend a lot of leg lock attempts by grabbing a collar or sleeve. The other thing? Lower body control is not rewarded is sport BJJ so a lot of guys neglect this even though it can just be as effective as mount or side control. You get 3 points for passing guard and controlling the upper body of your opponent but [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg7G2ZuMUU4) is considered a neutral position in BJJ (or illegal because it's a knee reap).

2. You will be better prepared to handle scrambles. It's not really something you learn in gi classes but if you ever take a wrestling class

3. You actually learn how to use less strength without the gi than with the gi because of the lack of grips. Guys with gorilla grip strength have to learn how to control opponents without sleeves and collars and must focus on hooks and ties. Yes the no-gi game is faster but that doesn't mean it requires more strength

4. ""Everything you can do in no-gi you can do in gi."" That axiom is largely a myth. If this were true we'd see guillotine and d'arce specialists in the gi game as well. It's never a bad thing to learn new approaches to submissions. 

**Edit:** Who's the dickbag going through pro no-gi every comment with a downvote?",self,t5_2qn02,1361145429.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/bjj/comments/18ohmz/why_you_should_train_nogi/

1357662748.0,166u9h,Tried Bjj out for the first time last night. (slightly embarrassing story),Luizeef,66,8,72,"so last night i walk in and the class is already underway and about 15 minutes in(my first mistake - being late) my brother and I got there at 6:30(the time posted on their website) and it was closed so we left and came back at around 7:15 and they were open...oops. 

so i go in sign the waiver and start class in a t shirt and shorts(dont have a gi).  they are showing the class what drill to run and then tell us to pair off. so i'm paired with this dude and long story short its basically me doing a shit job of remembering the steps in the drill and my partner just sitting there and walking me through the steps. its like i'm a little kid in 1st grade and he is teaching me how to do division or something. 

so i'm doing the steps the best i can(forgetting steps left and right) and everyone else around us is switching back and forth on running the drill. i start to feel like i'm just a burden on my partner because he isnt getting in the training he pays for. he didnt sign up to be an instructor for a day right? he wants to get his chance to practice the moves being shown and he is sitting there getting choked by me over and over again while constantly having to correct my mistakes. dude was super helpful and patient with me but i start to feel like i'm wasting his class time so after the drill is over i tell them i'll come back next week when i have a Gi and money for lessons.

on my way out feeling a little discouraged but not thinking about quitting so quickly. a couple guys in the middle of doing drills see me dressed again and walking out and they yell over to me where are you going? i try and tell them i'll be back next week when i have the money for a gi and all that but they can tell i'm a bit discouraged and probably even expected for this to happen. i dont remember exactly what they said to me but they tell me to not be discouraged and to get my ass back in the changing room and come back.

i'm not going to say the guy's name who really convinced me to get back on the mat but he was a blue belt and just a really helpful dude. when i came back he partnered up with me and walked me through the steps and made me feel a lot more comfortable with the way the first day was going for me. so he walked me through the drills armbars, mount escapes and was patient and helpful as fuck.

after that we had 5 minute sparring sessions and as i expected i'm getting thrown around like a 4 year old.  i feel like i'm 8 years old again and my brother is just manhandling me but its still fun as fuck to roll with people. so i'm getting tapped left and right. the only guy i was able to tap was a yellow belt dude that i'm guessing means he is from the younger class just moving up to the adult classes and i get the feeling that he sort of let me tap him a couple times because other than the 2 times i got him he seemed to be able to control me pretty well even though he is probably 5 years younger than me.

the last roll was with the guy i started with. the guy that i almost walked out on. he didnt roll with me in the last 5 minutes. instead he taught me a couple things like a takedown to side control and how to escape side control if that move is performed on me. 

after everything was done i got the blue belt dude's number so i can call him next time i want o come in and buy my gi. after they let me know that they didnt want me to walk out in the middle of a class because it makes me look like a little bitch and is disrespectful. he tell me this in an angry way either. everything said after class was positive and i cant wait to get back in but i'll have to wait a little while.

one thing i need to do is get stronger now. i swear i rolled with all white belts (except the one yellow) and they were all so damn much stornger than me it was crazy. anyone have good strength training tips for me?

1290461894.0,ea5tz,A Quick &amp; Dirty Guide for White Belts,whosthis,59,5,20,"I'm a brown belt and an instructor and today I felt like writing a train of thought piece for people starting BJJ and surviving the first year. I'm going to assume you don't train yet. Let's get started.

You probably like watching MMA and have the idea that training BJJ could be cool. Google BJJ gyms in your area and ask on sites like this for good schools to try out.

Stop making excuses like ""I want to get in shape first."" Nothing gets you ready for BJJ except doing BJJ. (Watching Youtube clips and trying them on your annoyed girlfriend doesn't count.)

Should you do gi or no-gi? This is irrelevant at this point. Find the best gym in your area and do whatever they offer. Eventually you should train whichever one you like more (or the best option

**Time to take your first class.** Wear shorts with no pockets that tie off with a good draw string and a t-shirt you don't mind getting ruined. You may be given a loaner gi to wear.

Show up a little early to meet the instructor

When class starts

The class will likely go like this:

1. warm-ups
2. learn and drill 2-3 techniques (you may get your own special first lesson at this point)
4. live drilling
5. and maybe sparring (not all gyms let people spar day one.)

If you get paired up with someone for drilling, then you aren't wasting their time.

Sparring time. Watching MMA might make you feel like you've got half a clue but there is an ocean of difference between watching and doing.

If you ever saw someone tap to a ""lucky"" choke or armbar in MMA and thought ""Why did he tap!? I wouldn't have tapped!""

If you ""almost get"" a move on a colored belt

**How to not make enemies on your first day:**

- Don't pick anyone up and slam them.
- Don't try any leglocks you saw on Youtube.
- Don't just crank on necks.
- Try not to spaz too hard.
- Don't brag about anything.

You are allowed to spaz a little because you are a white belt and no one expects any better out of you. But you should work to replace spazzing with real technique as you train more.

This class will be a blur and you will likely forget everything you learned. That's normal. It takes learning and drilling techniques many times over many years to really get them.

You are likely now aware of muscles in your body that you never knew existed before as they scream at you as you roll out of bed the following morning. That means you did it right.

The best way to deal with anxiety

Claustrophobic? Prepare to take confront your fears head on. This fear will go away as you get exposed to it and learn what to do.

If you smoke

**Finishing your first month.** Most people don't even take a second class

Time to get into a rhythm. Keep coming to classes

How many times a week should you train? Work up to at least 3 times per week as soon as your body can handle it. Here's a rough guide to classes per week:

1: You will be a white belt forever and barely learn anything.
2: This will barely maintain your skill level and progress slowly.
3: You will make headway and still have recovery days.
4: Now you're getting serious. You are becoming a fixture in the gym.
5: You will see big improvements but get more injuries.
6: You probably don't have a job.
7+: You probably don't have a job or girlfriend. But your BJJ is going great!

**Finishing the first 6 months.** Your body is probably getting into much better shape than when you started. You should take a look at your diet and sleep habits and try to improve them. This is good for you

**Ready for your first tournament?** Of course not. But do one anyway. Everyone should try it at least once. You will probably be very nervous. That is normal. The only way to overcome this anxiety is to compete so much you get over it. Unfortunately that's not a possible solution for your first competition.

Competing as a white belt is good too because the pressure to perform and ""prove your belt"" is much worse once your belt has a color. No one expects anything impressive out of a white belt so you are free suck and no one will hold it against you (except Youtube comments on your tournament video.)

I would tell you to not worry too much about your blue belt and you will likely say you don't really care about your belt. But I also know you're probably secretly coveting it anyway.

**What you should be working on as a white belt:**

- Regular attendance. This is the most important skill you can have because I could leave the rest of this list empty and you'd still get better by going to the gym.
- Getting in shape. You need to be able to handle a whole class from start to finish and never quit sparring because you're tired.
- Remembering techniques. Drill a lot and maybe keep a written journal.
- Defense and escapes. As a beginner you will spend most of your time in bad spots so naturally this is the main area to improve your technical performance.

Keep that up and you'll get better and eventually earn your blue belt.",self,t5_2qn02,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/bjj/comments/ea5tz/a_quick_dirty_guide_for_white_belts/

1. You will not represent any team but the original school you train at. This is for everyone of all teams. No politics or loyalty issues here.  No such thing as creonte or the likes.

2. This is a supplemental gym for you to train at during hours that you can't normally train at your own academy. People from all over will be coming of all levels during all different times of the day during the week.

3. If you qualify

4. Many people charge $20+ for a mat fee for one day. This will be $30 for a mat fee for one month.

5. You will be apart of a private FB group where people will announce group training times and if you are a key holder then you can organize times yourself as well at any time for the most part.

6. There may be possibilities to have access to some of the workout equipment and that would give a chance to also create group workout sessions as well. (Kettlebells, etc...)

More ideas to come...sound interesting to you? Please note in the comments if you are interested and you live in NJ or in proximity to Red Bank NJ...remember this is will NOT be a structured school and is only meant to help people train more or train for those who have no income to train. Will work on how we can make it easier for pure beginners. This is ideal for those training 6 months or more right now.

My instructor is a Carlson Gracie Jr. brown belt and one of the nicest guys I've ever known and now he might not even be able to do BJJ ever again. One of our purple belts who was a life long friend of his will be taking over for now.

I guess the reason I'm writing this is to help comprehend what is going on since it all seems so surreal. It's just crazy to think that he might not even remember some of us who he's trained up from lowly white belts. Remember today at practice to go and thank your instructor for what he does. Hell

Thanks

EDIT: If anyone happens to train with Carlson Jr. we've tried to get a hold of him but have been unsuccessful. If you train with him pm me so we can work something out.

1)  Not getting to train with physically similar partners very often.

Women &amp; big guys both usually have to work around not really getting much opportunity to work on their technique in a ""fair"" matchup.  For women, as they usually have unfair advantage they can't completely turn off, which makes it harder to be certain a technique is solid &amp; would work in the absence of a weight advantage.  

As a result

2)  Having to take backhanded post-tap compliments with a smile

""You're really good

""You're too strong for me.""  / ""You're smart with how you use your weight advantage.""

3)  Lots of trial &amp; error for a GI that fits

If you're guy that weighs 165 &amp; needs a GI

4) Advance beyond a certain level

Guys over a certain size &amp; women are already rare to begin with in BJJ [women moreso], often while seeming somewhat shocked you exist in the first place.  It sound nice at first, until it occurs to you that your goal is to be considered 'good' based on the same standards as everyone else.

Why?

Well, there will (*hopefully*) be more events like this and the need for a policy will increase.

So

On one hand

On the other hand

The mods have always been **very** hands off when it comes to moderation in this subreddit. There are very few instances where intervention was needed; the moderation log sometimes sits static for weeks at a time. 

So for now we are going to see what Metamoris says regarding the reposting of the videos. Maybe they will eventually make the streams free after a set period of time (that would be excellent marketing for the next one) or maybe they will simply serve DMCA notices and not respond. We don't know

All I know is that the event as a whole was just awesome. Replays are still available on the Metamoris web site.

Training start date: February 1

Promoting Professor/Instructor: Bruno Tostes

Compete or plan to compete: I competed Twice this year at local NAGA Tournaments Placing 2nd in gi at 190 and placed thrid in both gi and no gi at 185 in september. Hopefully I will be competing more this year. I'm shooting for 4 tournaments

Biggest success on the mat: Not spazzing out when a higher belt gets on top of me and still trying to work my game even if it mean constantly re-establishing guard and starting over

Largest area of improvement: Probably My sweeps

Most successful technique you catch on others: Bow and arrow from modified mount

Submission or sweep you always get caught in: Back Chokes just about any of them but im getting better at defending

f I start training, friends.

EDIT TIMESTAMP 13:55 EST: I am most grateful to hear all your commentary and thoughts. Thank you all. I fear, that my inquiries will not be favored at many Brazilian Jiu Jitsu gymnasiums/schools. This is deeply disheartens me because I was hoping to engage in a martial art and become a martial art practitioner. 

Some of these responses have poked fun at me and my beliefs and some have been mean and hurtful. Why must people be this way? When I immigrated to America, I feel that this acceptance is there and sometimes it is not. 

I never said that I disrespect women. **When I married my wife, to not touch other women after marriage. Is this so wrong according to you and your culture?** I have highest respect for women. I have my wife and my almost one year old daughter and four year old son. Do you think I respect my son more than my daughter? Or more than my wife? Maybe you think I would trade my wife for two goats? Or my daughter for 7 mules? Your views of my culture are just not fair. 

It is hard enough to maintain our traditional customs without being made fun of or told terrible things. I watch martial arts and MMA because it is very interesting and I wish to learn more. I also viewed it as a method to engage myself more in Western culture. It makes me sad to think I will be unable to do this. To say that I am a bad person that is part of a bad religion is not fair.

*  What makes professor angry...""I have kind of lost my motivation to train since I've found women and booze"" - blue belt quote.
I was so angry my head almost exploded when I heard this   
*  What makes professor angry...
Impromptu white belt seminars in the middle of class. I have long been a member of the club ""black belts against white belts teaching other white belts"" formed by my longtime friend Dan . The blind can't lead the blind  
*  What makes professor angry...
People who do not pay attention during the technique portion of class and then want to consume all of my time while drilling. Please pay attention and ask questions. I show the move and explain at least 5 times. If you are standing behind me move to a position you can see. The last time I checked I wasn't made of glass and you do not have X-ray vision.  
*  What makes professor angry...
When I tell someone to tap and they give the "" I'm good man it only hurts a little"" and snap. Now you're out for at least 8 weeks bravo tough guy it's training not the worlds.  
*  What makes professor angry?...
When people do the same thing wrong repeatedly expecting a different result . There are bjj commandments carved in stone that we all must follow. Example ""Thou shalt not hangout in someone's spider guard"". If you choose to hangout and continue getting triangled

*    Bjj commandment of the day..
""Thou shall not crab fight""
If you are not familiar with this term it refers to two people generally not in good position trying to foot lock one another. Crab fighting is usually a white belt maneuver where one person tries to foot lock the person who is foot locking them. Please let go of the foot and get out

But when we talk about the ups and downs of training

Tonight, we had five or six rounds of sparring in a row. I'm easily the smallest guy in my gym, and the only person my size (a girl) wasn't feeling well enough to roll, so I went up against several much bigger people, as usual. But I didn't do half-bad. I did a good job of retaining guard, launching attacks, and escaping back to guard or half-guard when those things failed. 

My crowning achievement of the night (and my BJJ career so far) came when I triangled a blue belt who outweighs me by 60-70 pounds. Now, and I capitalized on it. It doesn't mean much in the grand scheme of things. But the fact that I was able to capitalize at all shows that I've been improving, even when it feels like I'm at a standstill. I was so elated at my progress, I didn't even care when he triangled me right back about thirty seconds later.

The Gi top is an A3 but its been heavily shrunk so its basically an A2L.

The pants are an A2 and roomy (they fit me and I'm 5'10"" 199lbs).

Here is the deal:  I want this to go to someone who NEEDS it, please post up and tell me about your situation (or send me a PM if you prefer more privacy).  I will wait for a few people to post and then choose the person that I feel will benefit the most from this.  I'll ship it for free in the US too.

(Gi is white with black contrast stitching

Self post

**UPDATE 1:**  Wow I have gotten way more messages than I was expecting.  I will make a decision on Sunday (tomorrow) and update this thread with pics of the gi and the username of the person I selected.  If they want to share their story at that point

**A thought:  We maybe should consider doing this more often

**If we as a community can figure out how to make unused Gis get to people who cannot really train without that help

Here is a pic of the Gi in question:

http://i.imgur.com/VVQEoCv.jpg

For fun

http://i.imgur.com/TEFtTo9.jpg


**UPDATE 2:  I have selected a recipient for the Gi.  Two actually.**

First

Some people train no-gi and want to train in the Gi.

Some already have a Gi that isn't right for them

Some are ex military and really struggling to get things together post service.

Some are just really hurting for money

This decision is very hard because I know that no matter how I choose

After reading everyone posts and messages about 10 times, but needs a Gi to continue their training and get to that next level.

**Surprise:  I actually have two gis that I can part with.  The Ezekiel Kimonos gi that I posted a picture of, it will do much more good for someone else who needs it (and I have like 6 gis already).**

A pic of both Gis together

**Recipient 1**:  SeanC3

Ultimately, he will pay it forward by gifting another Gi to someone else.  He is meeting with local professors currently, trying to find a place to train and the Gi was a big sticking point in his finances.

**Recipient 2**:  wascawee_wabbit

A cook at a hotel who already trains 4-5 days a week no-gi, but I'm going to send him this Killer Bee Gi (its going to be big on you bro, shrink it up in the dryer!) so he can start training in the Gi asap.

I will contact these two guys today and ship this stuff out tomorrow morning.

I will ask these guys to come in here and simply let us know that the Gi arrived.

I hope that if any of you out there own a Gi you don't really love

BJJ has changed my life and if I can help open that door for someone else

UPDATE 3:  I just shipped out both Gis today

I was hoping I could get some opinions as to what I should do/how to act.

Background info: I've been studying bjj for about four years. 100% dedicated both on and off the mats. Became a blue in about 1.5 years. I come from a very small school. When I first started

It is an all male bjj class so very immature jokes are made constantly. At first I was fine with this and would also make tons of jokes myself, with no warmups or drilling. We'd pretty much sit around making inappropriate jokes. During one practice, two of my teammates (higher belts) held down another individual to take his rashguard off. Needless to say, he stopped showing up to class.

Because we're so relaxed, my sensei will have them teach a class. I'm fine with learning from whites, but I really don't respect some of these guys. The way they conduct themselves on and off the mats. I'll be honest that I am a bit jealous that the whites get to teach some classes seeing how we don't have too many high ranking belts, but I'm still willing (begrudgingly) to learn from those who know more than me.

Due to the small enrollment, the whites don't really understand the risk involved. I've had whites attempt to crank on heel hooks on me on multiple occasions. 

We recently started sharing mat space with a yoga group and I noticed my sensei (a single man practicing bjj for about 8 years) would often stop mid roll so that he can watch the females in the yoga classes. Sometimes during a roll

I've begun to try to lead by example and just focused on training and keeping my mouth shut

So what can I do from here? I consider these guys my brothers. I do a lot for my school and when I'm not there

We were going through some techniques and the senior student was going with the female as a couple of us watched. When they were going through some positions the male senior student was making inappropriate sexual noises and humping motions. The female student just kind of rolled her eyes some.

I spoke up a little but not forcefully and he kind of laughed it off. This senior student has a violent criminal history which makes me afraid to speak to my instructor about what happened because there weren't many people there so it would be easy to find out who told on him. 

I have not seen the female student since.

1360735374.0,18fj11,Visit from Royce - Reflections,IP3R2KO,46,2,7,"Hi all

This has been a fantastic community in the time I've been here

My head instructor got his black belt from Royce Gracie, since I haven't been training long.  I've never been much of a star-struck guy, and wasn't sure what to really expect.

I was sure that the big dogs in BJJ would be going on tour selling videos, except that every few minutes, Royce Gracie would walk around and show you how to improve your technique with your partner.  What's more, the lessons we learned were almost exactly *word for word* what we had been taught in the past from our instructor.  That's not to say that another pair of eyes (Royce Gracie's!) didn't provide some insight - I got plenty of great advice from him.  At the end there were some rolling sessions, and several members got promoted to blues and purples.  I've never seen a belt promotion before, and never imagined seeing one would be this inspiring.  I'm glad my first one was Royce basically saying ""Hey you, come here - you're a purple belt.""  There was really something special about it.


What do I take from this?  Well first of all, and black-belt-only techniques.  These techniques are taught because these techniques work.  It would have been really easy for a Gracie to travel around and peddle some sort of Acai-potion, or promote a special training regimen that ""all the black belts use.""  He could have refused to work with anyone but the most advanced students - after all, we white-belts can learn the basics from our instructor, who evidently knows all of Royce's lessons word for word, and it can be difficult to fit 60 people into a small gym to train.  But this isn't in the nature of jiu-jitsu.  Everyone is there to help everyone improve, succeed

Overall I think I came away with lots of technical knowledge, now go train.",,False,self,t5_2qn02,False,white-belt,

1. On the [""Main"" page](http://imgur.com/WseRzcW.png) you give the date, rolling, and at open mat since you started your record keeping.
2. On the [""Notes"" page](http://imgur.com/BJ6Mu3S.png) you provide more detailed notes if you want to. If you classify the note by starting position and move type
3. The [""Technique Lookup"" page](http://imgur.com/SYdIqQY.png) allows you to filter through all of your notes. E.g. you can filter by submissions from side mount top.
4. The [""Calendar"" page](http://imgur.com/IrBDxye.png) shows a calendar of all of the days you had any mat time. It also shows how many hours you spent in class, respectively. All of this is automatically generated based on your entries to the Main page.
5. The [""Mat Time"" page](http://imgur.com/CNF6tlx.png) shows a graph of your mat time and some summary stats about your number of hours per week.

If this might be helpful for you

Usage notes:

1. You should only have to enter data to the Main and Notes pages. Everything else updates automatically. If you do make changes elsewhere
2. For the Technique Lookup page to work
3. There is a good chance that you will dislike my categorization scheme that the Technique Lookup page uses. For example, etc. You can change it, but it will take several steps: a. Go to the ""Tech. Lookup Calcs"" page. Change the starting position and move type lists to whatever you want. b. Make sure the numbers on the left side of the list extend all the way to the last list entry. c. The table in the upper right has two formulas that will need to be changed. The default Position Text formula is VLOOKUP(J2,A2:B25,2) and the default Type Text formula is VLOOKUP(K2,D2:E8,2). B25 and E8 are the end positions of the original two lists - change those values appropriately. E.g. If you add two elements to the position list the Position Text formula changes to VLOOKUP(J2,2). d. Go to the Tech. Lookup page. Right click the starting position button and click ""Format Control."" Change the input range to include the whole list of starting positions. E.g. If you add two new positions
4. The ""Calendar"" page automatically starts on the week of your first entry and marches forward with no breaks. If you want to change that for some reason, select unhide). The entry in B2 is the first day that will be included - change it however you want. If you want to skip a large chunk of time, go to the box of the Sunday of the first week you want to skip and enter the date of the Sunday of the first week you want to include after the break. E.g. If you were injured 2/4/2013 to 4/24/2013, you can go to 2/10/2013 and enter 4/21/2013 to not display the 2+ month break.",,False,self,1369000078.0,t3_1eiyam

Here are the options that I've been pondering:

* Improve the basics that I don't use much and therefore aren't high level like guillotine, N/S choke. The goal being to have no holes in my basic game.

* Acquire proficiency in leg attacks and defense so that I'm ready for the toe holds and knee bars at brown.
 
* Acquire proficiency with the 'advanced' positions/submissions I've been postponing: 50/50, darce chokes, etc.  The goal being familiarity will all bjj positions.
 
* Work on chaining all attacks to a deeper level (3-4 rather 2-3).  Allow my training partners to escape the first submissions/sweeps in order to improve the quality of the subsequent attacks.  The goal being to improve my timing and develop a more complex game.
 
* I can also restrict myself when rolling by going for a specific goal (only arm bars from the mount
 
Any thoughts?  I've only been purple for a couple months so I'm sure things will become more clear with time but I don't see the 'essence' of what makes a brown belt.  Any links on the matter are also appreciated (I've read Roy Harris article and it was quite informative).

Edit: not dead. Lol. Just got out. On my way home will write a full write up of my experience once I get home and showered.  

EDIT 2: Full write up. 

OK guys so im showered and my GI is in the washer. Priorities right? So this is my first foray into a real BJJ gym. I had previously taken a BJJ class at a Community College about 3 years ago

A little background about me. Im a big guy in general, which played a big role in procrastinating my decision to start. If you know someone or have ever gone through depression, you know how hard it is to stay motivated and get yourself going. Finally after reading this subreddit and seeing myself spiraling out of control weight wise again, i had enough. I had lost 60 pound from Feb 2011 to May 2012, but i started a desk job in July and had gained 30 of it back and just didnt want to fail again. 

So I get to the gym, literally as i was getting out of my car. I head in and introduce myself to the professor/master?, im still not sure what to call him. He is very polite and introduces me to some of the other guys, and some of the higher belts come by and introduce themselves to me. I felt right at home, right from the get go. The nerves eased up a bit as to say hey its not so bad after all.

We start warm ups with laps around the mat

To end the class, and the basics of posturing and trying to break posture when your on bottom. 

All in all i had a blast, ill do the sunday class that is instructed by one of the black belts. If anyone is wondering what gym im going to. Its in Southern California, its the Cia Paulista Gym in Monrovia, taught by Master Freddy Sabbatini.

Also, if it's not against your end user licensing agreement.

Bonus: Some other interesting tidbits from the book to aid discussion

* Burden on the working memory (i.e. number of steps
* An interesting bit about chess prodigy Josh Waitzkin learning chess from the endgame first (also covered in greater detail in Waitzkin's own book

&gt; *""Josh’s original chess teacher, positions of reduced complexity, Josh was forced to learn the macro: principles. He learned the power of empty space, opposition, and setting an opponent up for zugzwang (a position where any move he makes will destroy his position). All from a near-empty board. By limiting himself to a few simple pieces, he mastered something limitless: high-level concepts he could apply anytime against anyone.""*

* Ferriss learned tango ridiculously fast in part by finding what tango masters learned late in their careers and focusing on that from the get-go.

* Ferriss recommends selecting techniques based on three questions: 1) What are commonalities among the best competitors? 2) Which of these aren't being actively taught in most classes? 3) Which neglected skills could you get good at abnormally quickly?",self,t5_2qn02,False,,white-belt,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/bjj/comments/146tc0/sequencing_bjj_in_what_order_should_techniques_be/

I'm here to state the obvious. I was training tonight and bumped heads with my training partner. Ended up with a few stitches. It's a contact sport, might have a different opinion. 

When the Dr. that stitched me up walked in and saw my bloody face, I thought, a fellow BJJer to fix me up. 

Turns out he did use to train. Until he got one of his training partners in a triangle, in pain, and extremely lucky that he isn't paralyzed. 

So, twisting the wrong way, or landing awkwardly happens, and you'll get injured. But you're not in the UFC and it's not the Mundails. Chill the fuck out and just tap when you get caught. It's not worth seriously hurting yourself or your training partner because you don't want to tap. I don't think I'm alone when I say that I have a lot more respect for people who just tap and start over, rather than flipping a shit and spastically try to escape (even if they succeed), endangering themselves and everyone around them in the process.

Suggestions/stories/strategies would be appreciated.

1355261213.0,14op62,"Very happy about changes at my gym, Gracie Barra Clearwater",Aesopian,48,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/bjj/comments/14op62/very_happy_about_changes_at_my_gym_gracie_barra/, I got started in BJJ thanks to a Sherdog poster steering me away from kung fu and karate by pointing me to what became my school (where I'm now a black belt and a certified instructor)

If you had stopped by Gracie Barra Clearwater over the years (maybe back when used to be called Gracie Barra Tampa), one tiny bathroom, no A/C, and a railroad track literally out the back door. We always talked about how we should get a bigger place, how we should market better, but never really following through.

That is until recently. My instructor, we've moved into our new bigger, nicer, better location that's right in the center of town. 

To give you an idea of the jump, a real lobby with a pro shop, real storage space for cleaning supplies. Hell, there's even free wifi and an all-natural, all-organic vending machine.

Those of you interested in how the Gracie Barra class structure works
&gt;Like a lot of the long time students, then had to bumble through warm-ups I didn't know, do more push ups than I'd ever done in my life, then be put up against the higher belts to spar (while trying to not pass out from heat stroke). After class, it was left up to me to figure out how to pay for classes and how buy my first gi, then let to wander away, maybe to never return. (This is also after it took me three tries to find the old gym back in the warehouses.)
&gt;
&gt;So I understand the old school pride and the ""you kids have it easy these days"" attitude of old timers. Many of you from the garage days have much gnarlier stories than I do
&gt;
&gt;As we approached the opening of the new school and I got involved with the planning
&gt;
&gt;You may have your own answers those questions, and seeing the new business practices in action, I am very happy to report that all of my concerns have disappeared. The changes have been for the best of the school, the students (even the crusty higher belts) and Eduardo. The new system has only raised the standards for training, and given the school a real chance to grow and attract new students.
&gt;
&gt;After seeing the way the new classes run
&gt;
&gt;- Getting to inflate our ego with the ""pride"" of being ""too tough"" for 90% of new people.
&gt;- A needless risk of injury that often ended new students' journeys into BJJ before they really started.
&gt;- Classes where the instructor has to walk the tightrope between teaching green beginners and seasoned competitors
&gt;- The attitude that ""jiu-jitsu just isn't for everyone"" that comes from not knowing how to give people the right kind of training they need in their personal development.
&gt;
&gt;And
&gt;
&gt;We aren't cutting out sparring, we aren't ""softening"" the training for the experienced guys. In fact, I've had some of the toughest and most technical training in years at the new Black Belt classes, since Eduardo is now free to really let out the techniques he's had to hold back not because he wants to but because he has to struggle with making the a single class ""work"" for everyone. We've been doing takedowns and sparring from standing in almost every class so far, and up to an hour of sparring. Like I've been telling the class every time I teach, by making a place for the beginners, we've opened up room at the top for the higher belts to get the training they need too.
