1269486717.0,bhvhz,"The Onion Uses Django, And Why It Matters To Us",westononion,307,60,http://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/bhvhz/the_onion_uses_django_and_why_it_matters_to_us/, so a bit late. Sorry if this is duping any existing threads.

Why

This is not a Drupal vs Django fight, but The Onion decided to stop using Drupal a long time ago. The Onion deployed a Drupal site back in 2005, at the time it was the right decision given the resources, yet even then we were interested in using Python whenever possible. We feel it is a vastly better designed language than PHP and of course any framework you're using is only as good as the language. We started rolling out other projects, like The A.V. Club, in Django. Just this past weekend we switched over The Onion proper, and we're seeing immediate gains in speed, and stability. As a team we have a pretty broad base of experience and I know we're all in agreement that what we've got now is better, VPS's. So this isn't just about The Onion using Django (and recommending it)

How

It took us about 3 months to convert our old Onion site to Django while we also maintained and built on our other sites. We already had some components written for A.V. Club, so we could rerun importing old data into the new system and fix and tweak. There is an enormous advantage using Django, sorl and PIL for creating image crops based on templatetags which gives the editorial and design folk flexibility they need (no more css cropping odd-sized images into place). Again, lots of work went into actually cleaning a site that goes back to 1996, Django allowing for a relatively minimal amount of coding -- particularly when it comes to the admin side for content entry, Django trunk we found almost ready to go as-is (something we did not find with previous Django). That we could use the Django admin rather than create custom entry forms I think saved us 2 months work.

Because

Cleaner. Much cleaner. Proper unit testing. Real reusable components across applications. An ORM rather than a just a series of functional query helpers. Tighter conventions (q: how often do people using Python argue about bracing styles? a: they don't). We can update then test a Django core change without worrying about having to take apart our applications, much more readable code. Every member of the tech team can meaningfully contribute because there are fewer specialized or hacked together pieces. We can move more quickly on large changes because of all these reasons. And we're more stable because of all the previously expressed points.

However there are a lot of views which don't fall into any particular app - for example the front page, splash page etc. In addition there are template tags, util libs etc which again are generic to the whole project (but not generic enough to be in reusable apps), as well as base models/views/etc. Ideally they need to live in an app so to be included in tests and suchlike.

There are 2 solutions I've come up with

1. A ""core"" app, but no non-abstract models, which live in the other apps.

2. Using the new Django 1.4 project default layout, which I use as the default app, and specific (non-reusable) apps belonging to the project live under this:

    - myproject
        - views.py
        - urls.py
        - models.py 
        - templates
        - templatetags
        - utils.py
        apps/
            someapp/
                models.py etc

The top-level views contain base views (if using class-based views) or views such as the home page that don't belong anywhere else. The urls.py links these directly and includes (using *include()*) urls from the apps. The models module/package is empty, and more specific apps under ""contrib"".

I somehow prefer 2) but I'm wondering if this might be an antipattern.

4. Submit a job to our cluster and run some computationally intensive analysis. (C)

Do I put them in my project root? eg.

        media
        static

    import os
    PROJECT_ROOT = os.path.dirname(__file__)

I can do:

    MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(PROJECT_ROOT
    STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(PROJECT_ROOT
    TEMPLATE_DIRS = (os.path.join(PROJECT_ROOT

Is this the correct way to do it for local development purposes?
I would also like to know how to structure the files for deployment.

* find a better way to specify text/html templates - now I have to provide template name for text and html
* instead of hard-coded css inliner it should be possible to specify inliner using settings (or disable it)
* find a better way to handle attachments
* find a solution for generating urls (not everyone wants to use sites framework

What do you guys think? I would really appreciate your feedback.

Puppet and Chef seem to be the dominant [open source configuration management tools](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_open_source_configuration_management_software). I'm currently using a combination of Fabric and Chef for automating the deployment of a Django app running across multiple cloud-hosted servers. It gets the job done, and a pain to configure. Plus, something feels wrong using a Ruby tool to deploy a Django app.

I'm tempted to get rid of Chef and just use Fabric by itself, in that they abstract commands across various operating systems, and provide some dependency management (e.g. using pip will cause python to be installed). However, I'm not sure these benefits outweight their added complexity.

1323463771.0,n6nxl,My take on Django .... comments,miketheanimal,22,8,26,"I've been using Django for about a year as part of a quite large
project
sized project. This is a summary of what I see as problems with Django
at least the the environments I work in. That's not to say that Django
sucks in general; just that I see certain problems.

1. The Django ORM is fine for simple CRUD operations on single records
in single tables. Where it really falls down is if you need to do
reporting. This is an area where the relational data model excels
database writers have put a lot of effort into making things like joins
work efficiently. Unfortunately the ORM tries to hide all this from you
(to an extent this is true of a lot of ORMs). I don't want to hint to
Django that I want a join
get me started on doing queries like ""select count(*)
max(age) .... group by postcode"".

2. Not stricly a Django problem
is unfortunate. This leads to the trap of equating the ORM with the
""Model"" in MVC. ""Model"" is business logic
relationship should be has-A not is-A. The problem rears its head when
you want an operation that updates multiple models. Ideally this should
appear in the business logic
view function
fundemental problem

3. I like the MVC architecture. But Django mixes the V(iew) and the
C(controller) bits
opposed to what data is displayed) also ends up in the view functions.
The view functions are really controllers in the MVC sense
they mix in view logic as well as the business logic.

4. View functions are not class methods. I've not looked at class-based
generic views so this might be an invalid point. However
functions are quick to create
common code. You can split out common code into separate functions
you don't have an object instance to store local state.

5. The URL mapper. Except in a limited number of situations (and a
newspaper site is clearly one)
irrelevance
on
URLs
around 1000 URL mapping entries
debugging is just a pain. The custom framework project uses URLs where
the controller and action are explicit CGI parameters
easier to work with.

6. Apps. Apps really don't scale. My Django application is a case in
point. Its divided into apps - setup, purchasing -
but they are not really separate apps
linkage could probably be simplified
10 apps and about 1000 distinct URLS
The tendancy is just to pile up more and more views into views.py. The
custom framework uses controllers with actions, a
separate controller for each form that the user sees. This does mean a
lot of files
but Django sucks you into agglomerate into a few view files.

7. Settings.py. This is great for getting a site set up and doing
something quickly
application is multi-tenant
decide which database to access
come from
hidden rather than explicit.

So that's my take. There is a lot of really good stuff in Django
in a lot of situations it rocks
cases.

1358807984.0,170lz6,Django REST framework and generic relationships,execrator,14,1,14,"Hey reddit. I'm new to Django. Here's the story:

I have a model with the following standard generic foreign key fields:

    content_type = models.ForeignKey(ContentType)
    object_id = models.PositiveIntegerField()
    event_object = generic.GenericForeignKey('content_type'

According to REST framework's docs

    class WhateverSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
        event_object = serializers.RelatedField(source='event_object')

This works fine

* I would like to use HyperlinkedRelatedField. This field requires the view_name argument
* I would like to nest the related object directly in the serialisation by saying event_object = SoAndSoSerializer(source='event_object'). The only solution I can see is to walk every *Serializer I have defined and check which has the correct model

Are the above cases just meant to work

1297187432.0,fhmnw,Can anyone describe step by step procedure to deploy Django?,,18,4,12,"Okay

I have seen there are couple of ways to deploy django apps but I think I wanna go with combination of [gunicorn and nginx like in this blog post](http://drumcoder.co.uk/blog/2010/jul/27/installing-gunicorn-debian/). Or if you have a better suggestion I am all ears. 

This is my attempt at doing it from scratch and hopefully you can suggest me where and what am I doing wrong.

**Step 1**: I install nginx

**Step 2**: Select a location where you want to save the project on server. I have Ubuntu on my server and I decide     /home/myusername/Sites/. I create a folder called 'mydomain' inside the 'Sites'. 

**Step 3**: I go inside 'mydomain' folder and create a virtual environment with the following command 
    virtualenv --no-site-packages venv

After that I do     source venv/bin/activate and activate the virtual environment. 

**Step 4**: I then install django and gunicorn in my newly created virtual environment with pip.

**Step 5**: Now I create a django project inside 'mydomain' with following command
    django-admin.py startproject myprojectname

**Step 6**: I will now run this project by calling ""gunicorn_django settings.py"" inside the ""myprojectname"". This should ideally run my project on 8000 port but it is currently showing me the error ""Connection in use: ('127.0.0.1'
When I give command     gunicorn_django -b 1000 settings.py it finally runs the project and says ""Listening at: http://0.0.3.232:8000""

**I get confused from now on**

I know I have to configure nginx but how do I do that. I understand that I will have to edit the     /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default now. Do I need to create a new file too for the ""mydomain"" I am hosting?

I should add I am not experienced with Fabric and git so if you are gonna suggest me some steps which require that then please be very descriptive.",,t5_2qh4v,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/fhmnw/can_anyone_describe_step_by_step_procedure_to/

My question is, validating files, tracking invoices, and managing these things on a schedule. We released an initial internal version of the software and almost all of the logic is living in the views, with another large chunk in the form clean() method for validating files. 

I know that ideally all this logic should not be living in the view. The view should be concerned with view logic: receiving input and / or rendering a page. In the ideal world, but I don't see how to apply it to our situation.

For instance, so those objects need to be created. E-mails need to get sent out. Submitting this form causes a chain of events that dictates logic to manage those events - it's not as simple as using a model form and hitting form.save().

Hi

    class Survey(models.Model):
        title = models.CharField(_(max_length=255)
        slug = models.SlugField(_(max_length=255
        description= models.TextField(blank=True)


    class Question(models.Model):
        survey = models.ForeignKey(Survey
        question = models.TextField()

    class Answer(models.Model):
        question = models.ForeignKey(Question
        answer = models.TextField()

Basically a survey will contain questions and their answers will be saved in the answer.

Now what I don't understand is how to create a form which will display all the questions of a survey when the view is called. I tried to create a form like this

    class BaseAnswerForm(Form):
        answer = None
        def __init__(self, **kwdargs):
            self.question = question
            #self.answer = None
            super(BaseAnswerForm
            answer = self.fields['answer']
            answer.label = question.question

        def save(self
            ans = self.answer
            if ans is None:
                ans = Answer()
            ans.question = self.question
            ans.answer = self.cleaned_data['answer']
            if commit: ans.save()
            return ans

    class TextAnswerForm(BaseAnswerForm):
        answer = CharField()

    def forms_for_survey(survey
        if request.POST:
            post = request.POST
        else:
            post = None
        return [TextAnswerForm(q
                for q in survey.questions.all()]

view for this is like

    def show_questions(request
        survey = get_object_or_404(Survey.objects
        forms = forms_for_survey(survey
        context = {
            'survey':survey
            'forms':forms
            }
        if (request.POST and all(form.is_valid() for form in forms)):
            for form in forms:
                form.save()
            return HttpResponseRedirect(reverse('show_surveys'
        return render_to_response(
            'feedback/show_questions.html'
            context
            context_instance = RequestContext(request)
            )

What this does is that, will this be easier using formsets, Can you tell me how it can implemented easier. Thanks
