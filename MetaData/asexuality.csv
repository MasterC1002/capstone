1337577153.0,tx3g0,Today was a pretty good day for me.,piggy_teapot,64,4,9,"I would like to tell you all my story.  It's a long

As a teenager, but somehow I couldn't imagine myself doing it or enjoying it.  I never watched porn.  I started masturbating at a fairly young age, but I didn't think about sexual acts while I was doing it – I just liked the feeling.  I wasn't sexually attracted to anyone I met.  Sometimes I had crushes on boys, really big crushes even, but while I imagined them hugging me, kissing me, telling me I was beautiful, I begin to feel occasional instances of hypothetical sexual attraction – I could imagine myself being sexually attracted to a person

When I was seventeen, I begin to feel romantically attracted to him.  He was aesthetically attractive to me and I felt very emotionally close to him.  Eventually, we started dating.  Our sexual relationship progressed much more slowly than it did with my first boyfriend, but when we had sex, I felt like I wanted it.  For the first time ever, I felt real sexual desire for somebody.  It was elating.  However, on the whole, other than my boyfriend.

I began to feel like a freak.  Other men and women around me were talking about sex

When I was nineteen, I wanted to own it in a way no one else ever could.  I hated my body for when it aroused others and for when it didn't arouse others.  I hated it for not desiring sex the way “normal” people did.  I wanted to be separated from this horrible body that wasn't me.  I wanted to make it disappear.

I was diagnosed with bulimia nervosa and started to see a therapist.  With time, and my eating disorder faded.  My boyfriend was supportive through the whole thing.  I felt better, but I didn't feel cured.  I still had very negative feelings towards sex.  The concept of sex made me feel awful.  Other people's sexual desires made me feel so...alone.  Left out.  I really hated other people for this.  I hated them for being normal, while there was still something very wrong with me.

My boyfriend and I got married when we were twenty-two.  He is my best friend in the world.  Our relationship is the stuff of fairy tales.  In our year of marriage, I started to feel angrier and angrier about sex.  I loved having sex with him, but it made me so mad that he was sexually aroused by other women.  Not jealous...just mad.  I also hated the thought that other men might be attracted to me.  It seemed they had no right to feel that way about me when I could never feel that way about anyone else.  I told my husband these thoughts one night in between a fit of sobs.  I said I just wanted to be normal, to be fixed.  We talked about the possibility of going back to therapy.

Then, I saw a post that linked to comments in /r/asexuality.  I had heard of asexuality before, but I was very misinformed about it.  I assumed that couldn't be me, since I had been in love and had crushes, masturbated often, and was sexually attracted to my husband.  Out of curiosity, I clicked the link.  I perused the comments thoroughly.  I saw someone mention the term “heteroromantic demisexual.”  I googled it and found an entry on demisexuality in the AVENwiki.

It was like my mind exploded in sudden simultaneous surprise and understanding.  Reading through the entry,” I sobbed happily, “this is me.  I don't need to be fixed.  There's nothing wrong with me.  I'm just this.”

Finally, labels are rarely 100% accurate, but this is the closest I have ever been to feeling like there are other people like me, like there is nothing wrong with me.  My anger has vanished almost instantly.  I don't feel afraid any more.  I don't feel ashamed.

Edit:  This subreddit is fantastic and you have a great community here.  Thank you for all of your support!

This hit the nail on the head for me. 

Whether you're an ace, it is **not okay** that our society expects that you owe sex to someone, simply because you've been on a couple dates. It is patently unfair. You do not ""owe"" anyone your body, or your discomfort.

This truly is rape culture, inform them if you're not interested in sex. But you shouldn't feel *guilty* for not wanting sex. It its neither bad, nor wrong, nor abusive. It is your own personal comfort level, and not something you should have to apologize for.

During a time where so much is happening for homosexual/homoromantic rights I can understand wanting to openly show your support in face of adversity.

But what about us? What about asexuals?

While playing a drinking game of Never Have I Ever with friends the other night, not at all?!' I find it kind of amusing. But this time...this time the response was a lot of pity. Everyone kind of looked at me with a sad smile and reassured me. 'It's ok, jahago, there is nothing wrong with being a virgin.' or 'Yeah, it's ok to wait, don't worry about it.' I never worry about it, but their genuine concern threw me off. It got me thinking: **Is there anything for me to be proud of as an asexual?**

I find my dealings with being asexual have mostly been understanding, I have never actually felt *proud* of my asexuality. I've felt relieved. I've felt happy to connect with other aces. But never proud.

Is not having sexual attraction even something to be proud of? As an aromantic, being asexual is like breaking the mold? Is that even something to be proud of?



Really



I think back to the rainbow girl I saw. Is asexual pride just buying an ace button for my bag? Is it changing my fb picture to an image of the flag?  Maybe tweeting a link to AVEN? Is it just making people aware that we exist?

I want to feel proud of being asexual instead of just blandly accepting who I am. I just don't know where to start.

**TL;DR**: What is Asexual Pride? Is it simply visibility? I don't know. What are your thoughts?

**Update**: If anything, and the community at large. Just the sheer effort people put into visibility, how accepting and all encompassing our community is, and how we haven't kept quiet and are gaining some momentum.  This is great. You guys are great. And that is definitely something to be proud of.",,False,self,1365458687.0,t3_1bxno9

I read a lot of Harry Potter fan fiction. And a lot of that fan fiction has smut. I would read these romantic works and think of how wonderful it was going to be when one day

Well, I thought. This fantastic feeling is a fairy tale. It doesn't exist and everyone just accepts that. 

In high school and college

I began my first relationship when I was 21 years old. I loved my boyfriend. I loved his smile, and even snuggling against him and drifting off to sleep. This was it, I thought. Soon, I was going to start to want to have sex with him. A year and a half later, the relationship ended (for many reasons and on good terms) and I was still a virgin. 

It was at this point, watching videos, and looking into myself before I realized that I am asexual. And that's okay. 

I still want a husband and children. I wanted them before I knew I was asexual and I want them now. It is no harder now that I've labeled it because whether there is a label or not

The one important thing that has changed is my view of other people

I accept others. And now it's time for them to accept me. Telling me that I have a sex ""phobia"" or that the right person is out there isn't helpful. I'll meet the right person. And we may or may not have sex. I may even develop a sexual desire

1373725540.0,1i7vb4,Reflections on a year of being in a relationship with an asexual,hagulden,41,5,4,"I am a 20 year old man

Neither of us has been in a relationship before this one. We were friends for about a year before we realised we each had a crush on the other and became more than friends. I am bisexual and have identified as such for a long time (I had my first crush on a girl when I was about 9, though. I remember feeling and saying that if I really loved someone, having sex with them is the last thing I would want to do with them. I was also very anxious about the idea of having sex or kissing someone (although I had no problem with the idea of hugs). My girlfriend is heteroromantic and is attracted to men in a non-sexual way. I don't know when she started thinking of herself as asexual, but I think it was some time between when I met her and when I asked her out. She has never been sexually attracted to anyone (she says she thinks she has experienced sexual feelings before, but never for a person, and never an actual desire to have sex).

Before I asked her out

Since then, rather than just really good friends? Well, we do kiss (we usually have very innocent 'peck'-like kisses; we have kissed 'with tongue' a few times, but I can't even remember the last time that happened... it was several months ago. I don't think either of us are fussed about that) and cuddle and sleep in the same bed. But that isn't the answer - we have a very strong emotional connection. I trust her more than anybody else. I enjoy her company more than anybody else's. I see her after not seeing her for a while and my heart explodes with joy. Then she goes away for a few weeks and I cry at the airport. None of that applies to anybody else.

The physical situation: we have never had sex (not 'regular' nor oral nor... hand-based... etc.). (Just to note - I know that it works for some people, but there are also bits of each other that we haven't seen and that isn't really a big deal either). As I said before - we do hug sometimes. The hugs are very nice, but usually not very long, and I always get the impression that they make her uncomfortable (although I have asked several times and she says they don't). We kiss a bit, as I said, but we almost never kiss on the mouth except as a 'kiss good bye' (and then it's still a peck as I described above).

In terms of 'my needs': Most of the time, and she says she has never masturbated (and I'm sure this is true). I do masturbate regularly (sometimes I go a couple of months without masturbating - not intentionally, I just don't feel like it - but usually I do it a few times per week). Sometimes when I'm around her I can get very aroused, but I try not to let this interfere with our interactions. Sometimes I will just disappear to the bathroom for a few minutes to 'relieve the tension'. Occasionally I will find it hard to sleep because of this arousal - and I have at times masturbated next to her in bed, but she is never involved with this and I try to be discreet and not disturb or bother her with it. I think that she is fine with this and it doesn't usually have an impact on anything between us.

We talked about sex and sexuality a lot in the beginning. I made it clear that she should never feel like she has to do anything sexual with me, sex happens as a compromise to satisfy the sexual partner's needs. However, I don't feel like my 'needs' are that strong (I wouldn't say I have a *need* to have sex at all - definitely a desire at times, but never a need). I think that if we started doing sexual things, 'regular' sex would still be a long way off - she is asexual, and I am still not very comfortable with the idea of it (although I would be comfortable with the idea of building up to it, probably). That might happen eventually - but as a natural course of development

One issue I have struggled with a bit is self-esteem. The one person in the whole world whom I would most want to be sexually attracted to me... isn't. Some people probably are, they kiss passionately and the camera pans away as they get into bed. Of course, I don't really think that that implies love, or that love requires that stuff. But something somewhere in my brain sees it missing and says ""hey, what's the deal?"". My girlfriend is not a very outwardly affectionate person anyway which can make these insecurities worse. But I have learned to understand that when she *is* outwardly affectionate to me, it really does mean a lot. I hold on to those things, and I know that she loves me a lot, at least) has nothing to do with occurrences of physical intimacy.

There was a time in my mid-teens when I thought I might be asexual. I don't think any more that I am - but I think that my sex drive must be lower than a lot of people's. Maybe this helps the success of our sex-free relationship. People have said that they couldn't be in a relationship like this, physicality be damned! And as I told someone who asked me about it once - it frees up a lot of time for more interesting things! We hardly waste a second of waking time together - we are both very busy students who also have other jobs and responsibilities, but we share a lot of fun hobbies and interests, and we spend as much of our free time as possible doing really fun and exciting things together - I may be a sexual guy, but I'm pretty sure that I wouldn't trade the evenings and nights we've spent doing those things for sex!

I don't have a conclusion. I don't have a point. I don't have any questions, they'll be aware that this is one of them. (That said, if anyone does want to talk about anything I mentioned above, do let me know).",,False,self,False,t3_1i7vb4

So I wasn't suprised when having sex for the first time wasn't mind blowing. Clumsy, and could be described as a failure. I assumed it would just get better. While it certainly got less clumsy, and painful, it never felt good, let alone the best experience someone can have. My first thought was that not only ""the first time"", but all sex is overhyped. An emporers new clothes effect if you will. No-one wants to be considered broken, so everyone lies to themselves and each other

So my first thought, I thought.

But I've spoken to my girlfriend, and it's not all just this illusion created by people all lying to each other. Perhaps sex is a bit overhyped, but to say it's all because of the hype is just wrong. Apparently there's something that's enjoyable about sex.

I'm 29, homoromantic, and I've never been in a relationship. The older I get, the more I fear spending the rest of my life alone. I'm not independent enough to be able go off and enjoy doing things by myself. I go off and do them anyway but I don't have much fun. When I look ahead at my future, I don't see anything but more of the same. 

I know I shouldn't put so much emphasis on pairing with another person, and if they did they would be going with their families.

It frustrates me that I'm not sexually attracted to anyone

I have always been this way. I am often attracted to people as relationship partners in a non-sexual way and enjoy non-sexual touch. 

&gt;Over the years, he will often been angry and/or violent. (This is why I no longer date without making it very clear up-front that I am asexual.)

_____________________

Think of it this way.

Everyone in the world carries around a travel mug of tea. Tea-drinking and especially tea-sharing are central parts of the culture. Everyone is very concerned with tea.

Some people have black tea, like white tea, or a blend. Some people only want to drink others' black tea, some are only interested in people with green tea, some don't care and find all tea tasty. Some people just don't like any kind of tea.

Some people will share their tea with anyone; some people will only share theirs with that special someone; some people spend all their time and energy trying to get to taste other people's tea. Some people's cups are empty, some never are. And some people are quite happy with their own tea, thank you, and how much they have or how often they drink is nobody's business but their own. 

Me, I prefer it to all the others. I don't mind trying some black tea every now and again, for variety, but I'll always want to go back to my own. I don't much need any other kind.

For me, but sharing that tea isn't something I think about. That is, not until I know you, and like and respect you, well enough for the lid to come off. I really only want to drink tea with people I already know and trust.

Here's the thing: variety is great. It's always exciting discovering a new thing, and I prefer to drink it alone. I'll share tea with you, if I like you enough, and I think it's important to keep our relationship strong, but it's not what I prefer. I don't get thirsty all that often, and when I do, my blend of tea tastes best. I'd be quite happy just to sit companionably beside you

This isn't wrong. It's not any more wrong than someone with black tea only wanting to drink other black tea, but people who don't share their tea — or who don't drink tea at all, and don't want to — are just fine. 

What's important is to figure out what you like — what flavors or blends appeal to you, *so* important to figure out how to tell other people, who may find your blend intoxicating and who might really want to share it with you, what you've learned. Hence this essay, which isn't really about tea.

Not everyone is interested in having sex. It can be hard to imagine in a culture as sexualized as America. Two out of every three shows on the TV contain sexual content. In a study for Kaiser Family Foundation, there is a small percentage that do not relate to those feelings. 

Researchers believe around 1% of the population to be asexual (Swash, B. 2009) Unlike celibacy, there is no choice involved, it is an innate characteristic. Founder of The Asexuality Visibility and Education Network (AVEN), David Jay (2012), describes it [sex] this way, “Imagine the most ridiculous thing that you can

Asexuality only directly refers to sexual attraction, homosexual, or other romantic orientation. Some identify as aromatic and do not experience romantic attraction either. The asexual community includes a very diverse group of people. 

Many unfair assumptions are often made about asexuals. Some of which are, and that they are really gay and just suppressing their feelings. These comments are very degrading and frustrating for asexuals. Psychiatrists occasionally try to say that this lack of sexual desire is a biological error; however there has been no data to support this. 

Asexuals do not understand why people care so much about sex just as much as others can’t understand how they don’t. This is especially disorienting in the early teen years when most peers begin to develop sexual interests. David Jay discusses when he was a young teen and his friends began to talk about sexuality and he just couldn’t relate. Asexual males are given an exceptionally hard time since sexual prowess is so often tied with masculinity. Oliva Gordon (2012) points out, asexuals – especially young ones – can feel as if they don’t officially exist.” 

There is nothing wrong with having no sexual desires, it has become “a 'problem' as it became more visible, and in a sense it's become the new stigma."" ‘Coming out’ can result in attempts to help them realize that they are just ‘misguided’ and can get ‘fixed’. 

	The key factor is generating more self-acceptance is education. Although asexuality has been in the media frequently as of late, teachers, and students can provide a level of understanding that has not previously been established. Those years when the other kids begin to become ‘sexually aware’ of each other could be much less confusing and alienating if the authority figures in their lives had some level of education on the matter to be able to answer some of their early questions and hopefully foster conversation with their peers. Supplying them with information and ways to connect with others, and a providing a vocabulary to effectively communicate with will give them the tools they need to gain confidence and acceptance of themselves at an early age. 

	It is important to remember that being asexual does not define a person any more than being heterosexual does.  Every individual is unique. We do live in a very sexualized country but we also highly value privacy and individual freedom. University student Anwen Howard sums it up perfectly when she says,,False,self,t5_2qv0q,False,,True

For six months I have delved into depression and denied it because of fear.  Drifted from the only forum that had supported me in this.  Finally this morning I came out to my wife. 

I came out about everything from my aversion to sex

My fear was unfounded.  She took time to process it

A common response you hear when telling people you're asexual is: ""Well, the people saying this aren't saying it because they are thorough, principled scientist, they're just trying to wave away things that don't match their understanding of the world.

Suppose you indulge them. You go out and you have sex with someone. Unsurprisingly, right?

""Oh, why do you have to be so obstinate?! This makes me angry! But they are right, most people report that sex is pretty lame on the first try. And why wouldn't it be? You have no idea what you're doing! So okay, lets indulge them further.

You have sex a dozen times, but you're commited to this course of scientific experimentation, so you slog through. Now they'll surely admit that you're just different and simply don't enjoy sex!

""Well, while trying different things, could reasonably be expected to produce better results than random fornication. You think we're getting in too deep? This is nothing, I'll tell you when we're in too deep!

So you go out and socialise, and over the next three years you have sex hundreds of times, trying something a little different each time. It doesn't get better. Well, no surprise there. But now, **NOW**, the people you talked to absolutely *must* accept that you're asexual.

""Some people just can't enjoy regular sex. You have to really get freaky with it and try out different kinks and fetishes to find out what it is that'll work for you."" Your shriek of frustration pierces the night

But hey, your long-term partner would really like for you two to find something that works. So you scour the dark side of sex, trying out every fetish, kink, and niche interest you can find. Man, who knew there were so many of those? Eventually you run out of steam, you've done a lot of thinsg you never though you would dare, now there's no way those guys can weasel out of admitting you're asexual

""Okay, look at all the sexual things you did. Especially the kinky stuff. Come on, what asexual person would do that?"" FFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUU-

My reply to that is:  “One, I don’t want a tiny, germy little human permanently attached to me. No. Just… No. 

 Second, and probably never will want to have sex. No swapping of bodily fluids for this girl. 

Third, I doubt that sex and children are in my near future. Or far one. Or any of it. Unless they aren’t mine.

Then

Uh. No? It wasn’t a ‘choice.’ It’s never a ‘choice.’  So then I explained how I’ve always felt. That I dated because it was the ‘norm’. Didn’t she realize those ‘boyfriends’ never lasted more than a week? Or that I never got physical? That the only time’s I’ve ever been ‘kissed’ was when they literally grabbed me and made me kiss them? That I never been physical with anyone.  Seriously. No. One.  I admit, Otaku-ish type person that (we unwillingly found out) likes to do bondage and sleeps with ‘whoever will have her’. ((If you don't like this discription, go to the end and see my *Edit)) I guess my mum doesn’t realize that I’m just not like that. I still have my Virginity, thank-you-very-much.
Anyway, like touched your or something? You can tell me.” Seriously? Does she think I got groped or whatever and that is why I’m Asexual? Oi-ve. 

 I’m not sure how else to handle this. What else I can say. I’ve explained it (twice in 3 hour long sessions), but she still treats me like a heterosexual female that is just going through a ‘phase’ ish type thing. I haven’t had any type of ‘partner’ since I was 15. Seriously. 
Long-story-short: My mum and I had a huge discussion after her drunken ramblings of how I’ve wasted the past 6 years of my life at college, blah blah blah, etc… Then, we have the ‘let’s talk about what I did/said because I don’t really remember and we should make-up’ talk, that led to the, when am I getting grand-children from you, which led to the ‘we’ve already had this talk, I’m Asexual, she is acting weird around me. Not wanting to hug, that’s fine

Which led to another argument that people don’t choose who they love, and it is just as natural as having different skin color, or eye color, or their looks or height. It’s natural to be different, and that includes sexual orientation. She refuses to see it that way. I refuse to give in to her views. Now she has no idea how to act around me. I told her that I am the same person I was when I told her, but she is still being weird. I’m not sure what to do besides giver her information, time

That was three years ago. I haven't so much as kissed a girl since due to pure lack of interest. I'm in college now, especially at this stage in life. I used to feel indifferent towards it, but as my disinterest in sex has further hindered my social and romantic experiences at college, I've begun to resent the notion of sex.

Right now I'm courting a girl about whom I feel strongly, no relationship can come of my efforts because I simply cannot satisfy her needs.

I'm 22, I know I want to be around them and rarely I'll get a little ""whooshiness"" or a dropping feeling in my stomach.

I've never felt a pressing need to say ""Wow, actually having sex with a stranger isn't something I'd do if the opportunity arose.

I do find women attractive and the idea of sex does not repulse me. I've been aroused before, meaning that if I had a willing partner maybe sex would happen. Obviously that's never happened for me so far. I'm not sure if I fantasize more or less often than most people. A highly sexualized culture suggests that I do it less but I really don't know.

When I first heard about demisexuality I thought ""Hey

While I haven't been diagnosed I'm pretty sure I've got some depression problems, probably since I was 12 or 13. I feel a lot of pressure, in a sense, to be in a relationship so if the opportunity arises I feel very anxious about our interactions. Just recently I met a girl at school, she's great, we went on some dates, and I could have had sex with her if I wanted. I decided to not continue seeking a relationship with her (another matter that I might elaborate upon if it turns out to be relevant). 

When I found out she wanted to have sex with me I felt really freaked out by it. Definitely way too soon. I find her very attractive physically but again, and I felt like a failure after hearing that I ""could have"" (her words) had sex with her if I wanted.

I don't know if this is ""normal"" IE it's something sexual people commonly experience - to feel freaked out at a prospective ""first time"" especially if relationships are completely new to you.

I don't know if this is a deeper anxiety problem because my mentality towards myself has always been self defeating, shyness, low confidence - these are all generalizations and they don't apply to me equally at all times, they're situational.

And, since I'm not anxious around women who are friends of mine, probably since I know where the boundaries are and sex doesn't enter the picture. Maybe if I am anxious, my anxiety is preventing me from feeling sexual attraction that I DO experience, I just deny to myself. I have no idea.

Any thoughts?

""Robert was a highly intelligent 25-year old graduate student in physics at a leading East Coast university when he sought treatment for what he called ""sexual diffidence"". He was engaged to a young woman, and with apparent understanding from his fiancee, he found himself uninterested in responding to or initiating sexual contact. Both parties had attributed these problems to the academic pressures he had faced for the past 2 years, but a discussion with the therapist revealed that Robert had had little interest in sex -- either with men or with women -- for as far back as he could remember, even when work pressures decreased. He asserted that he found his fiancee very attractive and appealing, but as with other women he had known, his feelings were not passionate. He had masturbated very rarely in adolescence and did not begin dating until late in college, including sex, the therapist asked the young man to invite his fiancee to a therapy session

Am I interpreting this wrong? Should I try and correct my professor? Should I just ignore it? I don't like being grouped in with people with Schizophrenia and DID when I don't think there's anything wrong with us.

Edit: Okay

Edit 2: So the professor emailed me back. He said that:

1) He does not endorse everything in the textbook (he says it's more like a supplement)

2) He pointed me specifically to a point in the book where it states that a requirement for sexual dysfunctions in general is that they cause significant distress or functioning problems. Thus

3) He said he actually had plans to the case of asexuality to argue that low/absent sexual desire is not always a problem

Edit 3: Yay! The professor did explicitly talk about asexuality in class, but the book itself still has a lot of issues. Specifically, it needs a better ""Clinical Case"" example, and it should talk about asexuality the same way it talked about exactly why homosexuality and gender dysmorphia weren't classified as disorders.",,False,self,1343338381.0,t3_x1i8x

Hey there

I am Jake_Of_All_Trades, but I have been a fairly active account and have always had the best interests for the awareness of asexuality and sexual orientation in general. I have also have talked in front of LGBT groups, Human sexuality college classes, and in small local newspapers. While nothing too large or in the public awareness, I believe that I have helped many understand asexuality and general human sexuality. 

That brings me to the focus of this thread: A mod from /r/Demisexuality made a thread regarding the low visibility of asexuality and demisexuality in other subreddits, or undecided (regardless of sexual orientation) may better understand themselves.

At this moment, but those who do talk will definitely have experience dealing with their sexual orientation in their life more proactively than most. This doesn't mean that others from each subreddit can't pitch in the discussion (you can, in fact, that would be absolutely amazing! =]. Nor does this mean you have to be asexual, perhaps you are a partner of an asexual person, your experience as a SO would be very insightful.

If anyone would like to participate or like to be a spokesperson for this group AMA

So

* /r/asexuality and /r/demisexuality group AMA for /r/LGBTeens the time of such is currently TBA
* Giving awareness about the differences of sexual attraction and romantic attraction.
* Need spokespersons to be active during the entire AMA answering questions/comments. (Preferred if such persons have previous experience talking about asexuality in front of groups of people)
* Having a fun and great time spreading visibility to asexuality and demisexuality!
* If you would like to participate

General questions expected to be answered:

* What is asexuality/demisexuality?
* What are the different attractions?
* Difference between sexual attraction and sex drive (libido).
* Difference between sexual attraction and romantic attraction.
* Personal accounts on what it has been like as asexual/demisexual.

Other notes:

* I have a Twitch.tv stream account which I could do live answering of questions
* I have already gotten the A-O.K. from the mods at /r/LGBTeens for this AMA. They will also put a notice up on the subreddit up to the day of the AMA so we can get more visibility!

1370256965.0,1fkoku,A question about one aspect of asexuality,l3rokenwing,24,3,17,"Hi

I care about her very much. The pain and frustration of losing someone so important to me has been excruciating. She has a lot of searching to do

I wanted to briefly explain my situation just  to really frame this question.  Do you feel obligated to tell people you are attracted to about your sexual orientation up front? Should you? I'm not stating it one way or the other

 It must be very hard for members of this community. For a homosexual person at least there is a fairly large distinction for your dating pool. Thankfully now as homosexuality awareness rises I hope its easier for homosexual people to both acknowledge and accept their sexual preference and find other like minded people. 

I guess what I'm driving at is do you feel the asexual dating pool lies only within the asexual community? Considering the unpredictable way in which people are attracted to eachother and become romantically (but not necessarily sexually) attached

I'll go ahead and admit that i have my own agenda. I hope that most asexual people are confident enough in their life choice to be up front about it. Through this whole relationship and the ensuing loss i've managed to come away with a kind of pro-asexuality mentality

I dont want this to be read as some push for having hard labels for this issue. I certainly dont think of asexuality as some kind of isolation tool. On the other hand, lowered self esteem, and depression i wrestled with (and still do) as a result of truly loving and being sexually attracted to a woman who became my best friend through our time together. Losing our relationship has been hard, but even worse so is the knowledge that this ordeal broke down our friendship as well. 

I know there are a ton of people who struggle with sexless relationships. Hell

There are certainly many degrees of asexuality. For many of you (my ex included) i understand that asexuality doesnt mean not wanting any kind of physical inimatcy. Most people have a desire to be close to the people we love and intimacy certainly isnt always sexual. But for so many of us that intimacy has a shared ground or is expressed through our sexual desire for our significant others. 

Ultimately it's the individual person's decision whether or not they are happy in a sexless relationship. Although there is no doubt in my mind that I would have happily married my ex if sex wasnt an issue i knew i couldnt live in a sexless relationship and marriage. Every aspect of my life degraded as this feeling of guilt and sense of not being good enough ate away at me. The struggle certainly wasnt easy for my ex either. I know that trying to come to terms with a topic she was very uncomfortable with (she has a general anxiety disorder which didnt help anything) was incredibly difficult. And my pain and frustration, and i hope she doesnt feel guilty about it now. 

I truly believe its not her fault or anything. 

I'm sorry this post is so long. In many ways this is cathartic for me and i'd like to hear your thoughts or experiences from an openly asexual point of view. I just hope more people can accept if they have no interest in sex and seek out other people who want romantic relationships but share their views. I think a lot of people have suffered simply because they loved some one genuinely and sex was just something they had to do to fit in. At least until the stresses of marriage and life crept in. 

**TL:DR: do you feel/should you feel obligated to explain your asexuality before a romantic relationship develops to avoid the pain and frustration for both parties involved of trying to sustain a romantic relationship when libido's dont match?

[Update 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/comments/14p33m/have_you_had_your_hormones_checked_update_1/)

Wow.  A lot of things have happened since I last spoke with you all.  It will probably be easiest to just go chronologically.

Okay, and took a half-dose for three days.  No effect (though, at the time, I kept joking with my husband that it was like when you've smoked pot but you're not high yet: ""I...I think I feel something...no, wait...maybe not....oh, is that it?"").

At this point, and am more atheist than anything.  I was dreading being lectured about God and morality and stuff.  But surprisingly it was very helpful and eye-opening.  I won't go into the gory details, but trust me when I say that I had/have a lot more issues to deal with than I thought.  The biggest take-away from that session was restoring the tiniest bit of self-worth and the will to live.  It wasn't much, but it was enough to get me through the next couple of weeks.

Stepped up to full dose, told me at this time, ""Oh, you'll know.  Trust me.""

And then Monday comes.  That week was probably (mentally and physically) the worst week of my life.  You know that feeling when you're driving along, though, was the nausea.  Before all this, I was counting calories, trying so hard to stay under that target number (usually failing by a beer or two).  But between not drinking and feeling like barfing 24/7, eating has become a challenge.  I've lost 8 pounds in the last month, which isn't negligible considering that I only weighed 120 to begin with.  I mean, but not this way.

The following weekend was the weekend before Christmas...and suddenly something clicked.  Most of the side effects dropped off.  I no longer dreaded anything and everything.  I could feel my depression lifting.  It wasn't so much that I necessarily felt better; it was more that at my worst I was much more positive than what it used to be.  Amusingly, brain.  I'm going to be happy, dammit!""

But the most unexpected change was that my sex drive and my ability to become aroused came back. Things that I had thought were icky (such as making out or bumping uglies) now turned me on just thinking about them.  It was difficult to bring it up to my husband (especially because we were staying at his mom's house for Christmas)

Simply experiencing those feelings of arousal gave me a sudden clarity to the last 7 years or so of my life.  Up until age 18 or so, I became depressed.  The first symptom that I acknowledged was the asexuality; my feelings of worthlessness followed later.  My grades began to slip, and I didn't really want to finish my major (but I couldn't think of anything else I wanted to do more, so I stayed with it, and I'm glad I did so).  Due to that progression/history, I had assumed that I had always been asexual, and my depression stemmed from that.  Now I believe that my brain chemistry changed around age 19

Anyways, I still have a lot of bad thinking habits to undo.  I am happy now, but I still feel worthless.  She is also helping me relax in general (to quote Ferris Bueller, if you stuck a lump of coal up my ass, it'd probably be a diamond when you took it out in a week), mostly with different breathing techniques and mental processes.

Yesterday I got the results back from getting my hormones checked.  Everything was normal. (Insert wry smile here)  We also discussed ways to minimise some lingering nausea (neither of us wanted to mess with the dosage of Wellbutrin).

Regaining my sexuality has been wonderful. I feel whole and complete again.  But I still have a long way to go.  And my husband and I still have a long way to go.  Again

The future: I am meeting with the gynecologist next week

My advice for those of you who are unhappy too: Persist.  In the past, and a counselor about my lack of sex drive, and none of them were helpful in the least.  And if this group of people hadn't been helpful, I would have moved on to another one.

We walked around the Retiro, the normal stuff. Hung out and talked by the pond. It was cute. He mentions the *teleférico* and I say ""can we see if it's open now?"" so we just up and left for Moncloa. As we get there, the last unit is leaving for the countryside, so we missed out. Whatever, nbd. He suggests a drink so we go looking around.

We find a place that neither one of us has ever been too, which was about 25 min away. We go up to my room and start a little foreplay, which I don't mind, and he knew I'm asexual so it was no big deal — I still like touching.

But he flipped me over at some point and started to try bareback. For some reason — and I mean because of pure infatuation with this dreamboat — I let him. No condom. The only lube being his spit. My god I sound like a barbarian, especially seeing how much pleasure he was gaining from our rendez-vous.

Afterward, and he said, ""fuck, we should have used a condom"" but neither one of us had one in the first place. I haven't fucked anyone since 2009, so why would I? I'm not into that… But he was paranoid and flipping out personally (definitely not letting me know how much that fucked with his head), and we went to wash ourselves.

When we came back to my room, and reminded me in seven days he's back in London. Me?

My relationship experience is abysmal. I wouldn't say that I enjoy being alone, it's never been something I felt that I needed, so I never went out of my way to pursue one. 

Nonetheless, which is awesome, and he's never really pressured me to do anything physical, but all the same, I KNOW that he wants it, and the thought is just something that terrifies me. I'm not sure what my problem is. I'm afraid of getting pregnant (no desire to ever have children, which is unusual as well), so that's mostly paranoia. I grew up in a conservative household

It's so hard to explain, it's not something that I ultimately desire. I could probably die a virgin at a ripe old age, and it wouldn't bother me, except that I'm afraid that would involve living a sad, lonely life. 

I've expressed these concerns to friends before and all of them just tell me ""You'll find someone eventually you'll want to have sex with"", but I think he just is hoping I'll give it a try and change my mind. Maybe I should? I don't know what to do. I want to make him happy, but not at the expense of my own comfort. Does that make me selfish? I feel like I'm broken, and I want desperately for it to be something fixable like hormones, but maybe this is just how I'm meant to be.

1355331484.0,14qd6x,A thank you and an introduction.,Throwaway_74,25,6,3,"   Hello

   I found this subreddit about 3 weeks ago, also, for helping me realize that I myself am a heteroromantic asexual. That being said, I'd like to share my ""story"" with you, as it's really all I have to give back to you at this point. Maybe someone out there will find something useful in it. 

   In middle school, among other things. This wasn't too much of a problem, as I still felt I had my dignity. I gave up on relationships for a while. 

  High school came, and so I felt like that was what I was supposed to do. My boyfriend did not ask for it, but I still felt like that was what I was supposed to do. I'd never felt like sex was important, and I'd never been sexually attracted to anyone. I decided that maybe I could.... ""Fix"" it. So, I treated him, and over the course of about 3-4 years, I watched the relationship crumble. By trying to make the relationship ""normal"", or like. How I managed to put myself through about 3 years of it, which brings me to where I am now.  

  My mother expects me to have children some day. She doesn't know I've ever had sex. I'm sure she worries that I'm a lesbian, mostly because I knew that he wouldn't be looking for a relationship with sex involved, and he's a nice guy. Unfortunately, he also wants kids one day, his own biological kids, and I feel like starting a relationship with him would be pointless, especially after he rejected me. *shudder*

   My best friend is an attractive man. He's great

   My family is very conservative. To them, Easter, Christmas, and other family parties are very uncomfortable. Everyone else in the family can tell that there's something different about me that they don't feel comfortable with, but they can't place their finger on it. I'm sure they, like my mother, have assumed that I'm a lesbian. 


   I'd like to thank all of you again. I'd heard of asexuality before, you wonderful people. Go get some cake and smile, because you are all great.  :)

Hi everyone! I just wanted to say thank you to everyone who responded to my preliminary post a couple days ago.  Everyone was very kind and courteous

A bit more backstory:  My husband and I recently moved to a new city, then went ahead and made an appointment.

This morning: I get to the clinic, with lots of different types of doctors (optometrists, dentists, family practitioners, etc). So right off the bat, I'm a bit intimidated--I feel like I'm in the wrong place, or like I'm using up resources for people who need it more than I.  But it turns out that everyone was super nice and friendly.

I fill out some paperwork, and I pretty much just say ""I would like to get my hormones checked, because I don't have a sex drive.""  She asks me how long this has been going on, *for as long as I know*, when was my last pap smear, *February*, am I taking any medication, and I've switched it up a few times to make sure it wasn't this particular birth control*, and how my relationship with my husband is in general

Pretty quickly, so that's cool.  She says she needs to go do some stuff, but she'll be right back in the room in a couple of minutes.

After a few minutes, do you feel depressed at all.""  Oh fuck, that's my magic cry button.  I admit I have felt a little depressed, yes.  ""How do you find it manifesting in your daily life?""  I tell her that's it not really that bad during the day, but at night, if I can't sleep, I just find myself telling myself over and over how worthless I am.

She tells me that I do sound depressed, and that she would like to put me on an anti-depressant.  I ask which one, because I know a lot of them absolutely kill your sex drive.  She agrees, and says, ""I'm going to put you on [Wellbutrin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellbutrin ""no seriously check this out, it's pretty fascinating"").  It's a bit different of an anti-depressant, it doesn't usually have as much of a negative effect on your sex drive.""  She sends the prescription to my pharmacy.

So she wraps up, where I'm to get my blood drawn.  I've never ever had my blood drawn, so I was rather nervous.  But it was quick, and was less painful than an immunization, so that was over quickly.

I set up an appointment to meet with the counselor, it'll be cheap.  If she is a good fit, great.  If not, it'll be the kick in the pants I need to find a therapist that I like.

Last

I go home, and after that, I'll be taking 300mg a day.  A friend of mine who is no stranger to the world of anti-depressants, tells me this: ""If something like that [asexuality/no sex drive] is having really ANY negative impact on your life it's enough to take medication.  What it does, is give you the power to consciously control your own emotional systems.  And just to warn you, the first few weeks you are on it are probably gonna suck. Your body has to get used to it.  But once you get to that point it can make an amazing difference.""

So right now, in that *I'm being proactive about my life* kind of way.  I'm currently sipping on a [beer](http://www.lefthandbrewing.com/beers/fade-to-black-vol-3), which will probably be my last until the follow-up appointment. :(

Depending on how immediately the effects of the Wellbutrin are felt

tl;dr: Had blood drawn

I say we go for the main two. /r/AMA and /r/IAmA would give us a better audience and a chance of finding those who are asexual or somewhere on the ace spectrum that may not realize it yet. Also we would need an even wider spectrum of asexuals and nonasexuals to help with it.

I think it could also be a good idea to contact the mods of /r/AMA and /r/IAmA about doing a joint one advertised on both

So, if at all.  Since finding out that asexuality DOESN'T necessarily mean that you don't masturbate, want/have a partner, and so on, its felt rather descriptive of me.  However, a huge stumbling block in identifying as being on the asexuality side of the spectrum been trying to figure out exactly what ""sexual attraction"" is, and whether I experience it or not.

Since 'sexual attraction' is the ONLY aspect which defines asexuality according to AVEN

I got really caught up with this issue for a while, whether something makes them more or less attractive, and can feel a desire to cuddle with them depending upon those traits.  Only, the desire to actually have sex never pops up for me(inside or outside my relationship).  I could rename it 'sensual attraction,' or 'aesthetic attraction;' but between what I've read self-identified sexuals write, and the very definition of primary sexual attraction on AVEN(""may or may not lead to arousal or sexual desire""), it seems disingenuous to suggest that it is anything less than low-intensity sexual attraction.

So going purely by the definition, which is pretty much nil.  While I don't mind it, and even enjoy it for various reasons(the chances to cuddle, making him happy, etc.), I have pretty much NEVER felt what I can really say is a desire to purely have sex with someone else.   I felt it once when cuddling with my boyfriend, but looking back that just kind of confirms that about 99% of the time I'm perfectly and utterly content to cuddle and stuffs.  In nearly a year of being with the love of my life

Eventually, but I can't help but feel that the current AVEN definition doesn't very accurately reflect, acknowledge, or properly explain the experiences of a  fair number of asexual-identified people, for whom the question of sexual attraction is incredibly complicated.
 While there is definitely wiggle room

Recently, I have always considered myself an asexual since middle school, and this was true, I WAS asexual, was.

This isn’t a “see, and when you realize that word ""different"" applies to you in a way that sometimes others won't understand, then it hits like a punch. Sometimes you attribute other words like, ""alone"". On good days you may call it, ""Unique"", on bad days, ""freak"". It isn't always easy being asexual because it is confusing

Some people have asked me in the past, you have to base the fact that you are something by *not* experiencing it. 

&gt; They [Asexuals] experience no sexual attraction for a great deal of their lives and this can separate them from their peers in adolescents because relationships are largely based upon sexual urges and cues.

&gt; Let's say that they look online to find that there are others that are asexual, many of them are aromantic.
&gt; This person sees this and constructs a social ""norm"" and attempts to fit into this norm. 

&gt; Then

&gt; ""But wait

&gt; As an asexual he/she still doesn't experience sexual attraction

&gt; ""But wait, let's say, and that kicks them in the existential behind and they think, ""I shouldn't be enjoying sex, I'm asexual"". But the fact is that they can feel these things and the most troubling for them is that they do sometimes experience these things. When or if that does happen they feel lost because they aren't being ""asexual"". Many aren't informed the difference between sexual attraction and libido, many aren't informed the different types of attractions, and many are confused when they attempt to figure those things out.

For me, and why I felt confused on why I wanted to please them sexually; **it was because I had a blueprint of what I should be, instead of what I actually am and want to be**. That, however, is self discovery and you can only teach so much about the self, one has to experience it for themselves or in this case; not experience it. 

Most of all, what*”, I worried, “*What will my significant other say? What will my friends say? They will believe I’m full of crap. Maybe I am, maybe I never was asexual and it was that I repressed myself because of some reason*”.

The truth is, but I was asexual and there are others out there who are asexual and **always will be**, but I am not one of those. I’ve come to accept myself for what I am and what I do.

I have a choice accept what I am. You have a choice to accept what you are. If you try running from something that you are

Sure, honestly, fully are** whether heterosexual, demisexual, asexual, transexual, or whatever. You have a choice to realize that your sexuality has zero impact on if your quality of character. If something changes about your sexuality then do not hide from it. Accept it as just something you are and realize that something you weren’t.*2 Also

1368571653.0,1ecg6w,Does anyone ever long for understanding instead of the stereotypical relationship?,zoserintherain,20,2,16,"I'm 22 and female. The reason I'm here is because I do identify as asexual, I guess

I attempted to reach this place of understanding through the romantic aspects of the relationships, on some level, but we fell into routines and a commitment to one another that we would never change. But we were, in fact, growing and changing people, and the more we attempted to ascribe to this person we were when we met, the more we restricted our changing feelings. Our individual lives became increasingly shrouded in secrecy, ironically

But this always seemed to conjure feelings of obligation and restriction. The things we did to keep the relationship secure were things we essentially did for ourselves. We wanted to stay the way they wanted us to stay, too. We had to be the person they could count on, so they'd be the person we could count on. 

But it didn't feel like this was something we'd strive to do even out of respect for one another, out of a commitment to provide that security to one another. But I think that's where hurt feelings come in. We give and do not get, or we get knowing we don't have to give, and unless everything is equal in the relationship, we feel hurt. But things can't always be equal. We'd say we understood that our partner needed to spend more time on school or work than on being with us, but we felt neglected. We said we understood when our partner needed time to themselves, but we struggled with the feeling that we wanted to be with them.

I always strove for this place of understanding where I imagined we would just know that someone completely understands us

It's a kind of understanding that says, or what I do, you'll always know me, and I'll always know you.""

It's not a commitment. It's not an effort to become something or someone, where we let down our walls and discard our facades to share in the fact that we're scared about life and about the future. We don't know anything about anything, and we don't have anything figured out, and we never will. It's a place where we share in this, in the struggles of daily life that we're led to believe should not be struggles. I feel like this is a place where we could unite as human beings, and a place where we wouldn't feel alone. 

To everyone else, because that's what people are supposed to do. But we'd know that somebody knows us, someone knows that we are always trying, always struggling, to do things right, to be what we should be, to get by, instead of becoming angry at others or ourselves for our supposed inadequacy, and we understand their struggle as well, could even unite in this way

But I think out of this develops a genuine confidence

I feel like I have always lived my life with this understanding, and so I don't take things personally. Maybe I have a flawed perception of the world, but I feel like people do ""bad"" things when they feel helpless. I don't condone these things by any means, but I don't condemn the people themselves for committing them. I think they make decisions or take action when they feel vulnerable, and not having the control over it or over themselves that they feel they should. I often feel like having a place to honestly admit having no control would ease tension. A place where it's okay to admit our faults to people, because they understand and look for ways to help us help them, because we all understand that we are all just trying to do what we can to make use of our strengths for the common good. A place where genuinely giving all we can is always good enough

Well, but I imagine a world like that working that way. 

But in the end, too, would feel like the most secure companionship possible, even though it might not include commitments or the security of routines. It wouldn't be about sex or a need for someone to fulfill those needs. It wouldn't be a companionship based on emotion, even, or I don't believe it would be. Just a pure understanding.

I might be idealizing the possibility of this concept, it's not about the tangible experiences. I really do believe people want to share themselves and their strengths, and want to know it will always be enough, and having a companion like this would allow them to know that it always will be, to at least one person. I think it would encourage people to give all that they have, and become satisfied as a result, because they are not acting out of fear or anxiety about what others will think about them. They do their best to help make the world a better place, happier

Again, because they won't understand us or our motivations, and if what we give is ""not enough"", we are shamed for that, instead of appreciated for our good will.

So, and not sure I'm doing an effective job. Does anyone understand what I mean? Does anyone think it could be possible? Perhaps not on a large scale, but between two people? I am totally open to any alternative perspectives, or discussions. I think a lot about this on my own, but think it would be interesting to know the way other people think about this as well. I thought I might have some luck here, since it seems like asexuals are generally not seeking the stereotypical relationship, but if you have any suggestions for another place where this would be more appropriate

Two weeks later, I had never thought of wanting to have sex with her throughout this time, and it was certainly not my motivation for initiating our relationship (my motivation was romantic love, I wanted to be closer to her, to have a unique role in each others lives, to have more personal intimacy).   She was a virgin, but didn't even tell me.

As our relationship continued, and these were taking forever to heal, so I said we couldn't have sex for a while - we never got the routine back after that.

Our relationship had other problems.  We both had fairly major mental health issues - me having bipolar disorder and being in the closet about being transgendered

We've gradually reconnected through email, but in retrospect I was asexual (maybe that will change from my transition, but maybe not), and she was aromantic.   I say that because, though for a long time I thought she just wasn't into me, she used to say things like ""sexual attraction has nothing to do with liking someone intellectually, I'd want my partner to be a guy version of a bimbo wife.""

I'm still very much in love with her, but rather happy for her that he fulfills that role better than I did.  I think she has always had the same romantic feelings towards me as I do towards her, but she calls them by a different name (she says we're ""really close, special friends""), and for her the feelings never got confused with sexual attraction.   She doesn't believe that I'm asexual, because in her mind I pushed a physical relationship on her, and to her physical relationships are all about sex.

I'm a 21 year old male, but my experience in these areas was exceedingly limited compared the people I hung around with. Usually I was able to keep my callowness fairly low key, but as many of you have come to know, social pressure can become pretty overbearing at times. I ended up meeting a girl on a dating website who was really into me, and after talking to her for a while, she agreed to meet me for dinner and spend the night at my place. We ended up watching a movie and cuddling together, which I enjoyed quite a bit, she wanted to take it a step further. At this point, but I simply couldn't derive any shred of enjoyment from the activity. This just left both of us feeling incredibly confused

It wasn't long after that when a friend of mine obtained what he proclaimed to be unusually strong LSD. While I wasn't terribly enthusiastic about drugs, but there was one thought that stuck with me during my trip: I had a decent amount of sex recently, as society expects of men in their 20s, but I didn't enjoy it one bit. Conversely, I had just taken a very illegal drug for which many people would stigmatize me, but I was having the time of my life. This made me ask myself: why am I taking advice from a society full of people who don't even know me when the only person who really understands me is myself? I concluded that sexuality was a continuous, multi-dimensional spectrum, it was unreasonable to blindly accept that as absolute truth. I decided the most accurate label for myself would be ""asexual"", I started to second-guess myself

More recently, and naturally, I wanted to get to know her better. The next week, I invited her over to my place for the sole purpose of hanging out; I wasn't expecting or wanting sex, although I did contemplate the possibility of this turning into a relationship over time. And at first, we were both having a great time. We were cuddling, watching TV, until I completely killed the mood. We began cuddling more intimately and kissing, the inviting look on her face turned to fear. We stopped abruptly and talked things over, I try to treat everything as a learning experience

We are hanging at my house for a movie date, we are doing some (sensual) fooling around. Just kissing and cuddling, a tickle here and there. We have some personal conversations on sex and fetishes and such that no one really needs to know but us. Near the end of the date, she stands up to brush her hair so no one suspects we were fooling around. This is where it gets surprising. I stand up, and hug her. Couple kisses. I pick her up, and she wraps her legs around my waist for support. This is pretty normal stuff for us when we are alone. Then, I decide to put her down on the couch with me on top of her. We then, without any talking, and decide to try again to see what happens. For Science! Anyway, separated by clothes. Just so you guys don't think I misread anything or forced this in her

So basically, she felt just as sexual as any other sexual person. She kind of wants to know how to deal with it too. Does this mean she isn’t asexual? Is she Demi? We just do not know, and were hoping you guys could help us out, because we are both confused.

Looking back, and support of my feelings. The commiseration of others surrounding the same issues I was having was a huge relief. Nobody told me I had to change, or was wrong for feeling like I did.

Change is OK too. Maybe I was a dumb teenager donning a label before reasonable, and it isn’t really helpful to think of it like that.

It's frustrating, because I know sex feels good (i've had a few partners, but nothing really compared to when it was with my girlfriend of a long time), but I still am never in the mood. (even tried nofap thinking it was that, with lackluster results).

Fast forward to a little while ago. Whirlwind romance with this girl, I don't feel the drive. She's jokingly called me asexual (and I told her I've actually considered it). The weird part is, I almost feel like she is too, but I'm scared to actually talk about it with her.

I'm not sure what to do, because I want to please her but I'm just never really feeling it. I love touching her and feeling her body, but I just never really want to have sex, I just like being with her.

I've never really paid any attention to anything sexual. As a teenager I never watched porn, spend much of the school day together and I'd spend as many weekends with her as I could. I've only just thought back on that relationship as I started writing, and suddenly it makes sense to me why she broke up with me: I simply wasn't showing her much interest sexually at an age where I guess I should have been mad for it. But it never progressed beyond a bit of groping on the outside of clothing.

At university I never did the whole sleeping around thing that TV shows seem to associate with college. I never felt the urge for sex, and yet again I couldn't go the distance. It was during this relationship I was first given the 'opportunity' to play with my girlfriend's breasts but I just didn't get why I would want to. It was being presented to me as a reward or gift or something...I don't know, something I should be thankful for. But it didn't arouse me in the slightest, and I just felt I was doing it for her benefit only. When it came to progress beyond that once I backed out because I started to feel sick. I'm not really sure if it was because of something I ate. I told myself that but I'm not so sure any more.

Fast forward to two years ago, I love her and we're making it work as best we can. However, about a year ago she had a mini-breakdown of sorts because although she knew I love her and cared about her, she didn't know if I found her sexually attractive, largely stemming from the fact that we haven't had sex. I tried reasoning it through in my head and I tried to convince myself and her that it was just because I was a virgin and so nervous about the whole thing that I wasn't initiating in case I screwed it up and embarrassed myself. We never really confronted the issue again, though I can tell it still affects her sometimes, and I feel awful for not being able to help her.

More recently I think I've come to terms with the fact that despite loving her I don't find her (or anyone else) sexually attractive. And I know I have to tell her, I know it'll hurt her if I say that to her, no matter how I word it, and I can't bare to do that to her. I just can't be a reason to make her cry. And I'm terrified of the fallout. People will want to know why we broke up if it comes to that, then the can of worms will come spilling out.

Can anyone here relate to my story? I doubt the start of the story is uncommon to people here, even though I kinda know what I have to do. Does that make sense?

I feel sort of stuck. Boiling down my sexuality, but I really can't garner a good reasoning otherwise. (b) I'm only human — I may not want sex but I don't want to be with someone whom I can't look at up and down and say ""I like that"". People tell me that's still rooted in sexual attraction, but I'm not so sure. I want a man who can hold me and make me feel warm and comfortable without needing to turn me over and fuck me sideways.

I know it's a common issue/problem for asexuals to have to explain these things, they can't understand why, if I don't want sex, I still enjoy self-stimulation.

Does anyone have a good analogy or something that I can use to at least attempt to express my gray-A-ness? I'm drawing blanks here and it's just getting more and more difficult to cope with when the subject comes up.

**Am I an asexual?** I know you get these posts a lot and for what its worth I'm sorry to have to add on to the pile of them. However, in fact are always helpful about it. I've read most of the FAQ on AVEN's site some and have browsed several posts here trying to glean some information but it seems like everyone's case is different and mine is no exception. Unfortunately, there's no way I can make this quick, it's a lot of information.

**First, much less a sexual partner, I did start to become discouraged. I'd say it was maybe when I started college that I came to realize that sex actually isn't a huge deal to me anymore, though at this time I was unaware asexuality was actually a thing so I assumed I was just a heterosexual with a low sex drive. It didn't take long for my other hobbies and interest to become more important to me than my quest to lose my virginity. Though I have to admit that a small part of my aversion to sex is fear of the unknown. I can't assume this, but I think that a persons first time always has at least some form apprehension to it. Or not maybe I'm just weird. So my first point is this: Can I really say that I'm an asexual even though I haven't experienced sex yet? Can I have an opinion on something that I don't actually know? Finally, is this a sign that I may be an asexual or is this just my brain trying to rationalize that fact that I'm 22 years old and still haven't had sex?

**On to my next point, and I enjoy masturbation quiet a bit. Porn has even become something of a culture between me and a small group of friends. I've found that I've gravitated more towards hentai and other drawn forms of pornography. I don't think that I have a high sex drive even though I do enjoy masturbation, I tend to think of it more like a massage, just something to bring pleasure but I can't be sure I don't really know how hormones and ""sex drives"" work (I mean I have a vague understand of biology but I don't really know the specifics). Is it possible for an asexual to have a high sex drive but just not want to share it with another person (basically autoerotic, I guess would be the term)? Can you be autoerotic and asexual? Lastly, if you find yourself ""sexually attracted"" to things that don't exist, what would make that make you sexually? (Not saying that I am actually sexually attracted to anything but I've explored that possibility that I may be sexually attracted to art

**Let me be absolutely clear** on that last question. Yes, what sexuality would that encompass? Would that still make me hetero even though the thing I happen to be attracted to doesn't actually exist and if they did probably would no longer be attracted to them.

A little background: I realized late high school/early college that I wasn't attracted to women, btw) group and attending dances and other events.

Yeah

I eventually just sort of petered out on going to events (I always found the dances uncomfortable). At some point I learned that asexuality was a thing. I found it tremendously comforting that there was even a word

Somebody posted a ""Gender and Sexual Minority Megathread"" on, so I felt compelled to finally just come out with it. My first post is on the second page, if you want a longer version of my story (and I think there was some good discussion on the next few pages too).

And then I started coming out to my friends. I went for my gay friend Jon first (he was also the first person I came out to as gay), but I do feel good finally getting this out in the open.

The next step, so I'm grateful for that. I don't want them to think that this is something that will make me unhappy, or anything like that. If anybody has any advice re: that, I would appreciate it.

1327354117.0,oteqz,Anxiety ridden question,faltered,15,1,20,"Okay

From the time I hit puberty I always had a sex drive.  Well, but when it comes to sex I could care less.  In fact I could care so less that I had problems getting and keeping an erection for sex since my first date.  I am married now, and have kids but have been celibate for at least 2 years.  And I don't miss it and the thought of having sex is nauseating at times. 

My doctor said I have low testosterone.  So we corrected that.  It made no difference at all and my levels are normal now and have been for nearly five years.  I went to a therapist at the request of my wife and she said I was a sexual anorexic.  I stopped therapy when part of the solution was that I needed to start making time for sex.  I can't make time for it

But after lurking here and reading allot I'm actually allowing myself to entertain the idea that maybe the way I have been my entire ""adult"" life (started in teens) is normal.  Maybe something isn't wrong with me that no one can figure out.  Maybe I'm not a freak

I need to talk to someone but have no one to talk to about it.  Ask me any questions you want.  Under this guise I have no problems answering them.  Has anyone else ever been told they were sexually anorexic? I wasn't sexually abused.  Religion was strict but sex was considered beautiful within the confines of marriage.

I experience aesthetic and romantic attraction, believe it or not.

I enjoy the usual asexual stuff

We're very open and honest about things in this area, there's no sexual touching or anything involved, just kissing for extended periods of time) more frequently as we both got more comfortable with each other. It's slowly gotten less and less awkward as we get better at it, and we both thoroughly enjoy it. As this has happened, the intensity has gradually ramped up from just gently kissing to something more involved, more passionate. 

I have disliked the idea of french kissing for as long as I've known about it, but we ended up doing it for much longer than usual, and a bit more intensely than usual. And I noticed that she was using her tongue, albiet subtly. It was just sort of there and involved in the kissing, ha. We stopped, and kind of chuckled, and she said ""I apologize if you felt like there was tongue, it just... sort of happened."" I asked her how she felt about it

After a moment I pulled back and asked ""do you want to just, which I now understand. thinking about it now, putting your tongue into someone else's mouth, or vice versa, is bizarre and weird. But in the moment it sort of clicked and made sense. it was an interesting experience. I was surprised with myself and with her, and also with the experience itself. I think it's likely to happen again. 

I have been revolted by the idea of tongues being involved in kissing for years and years, I suppose. and it's still really really weird. I mean... tongues??

When I was a younger child, but I seemed to remain the same, thinking that perhaps I was somehow 'delayed' or something to that effect. But as most here might guess, I never took on a 'sexual attraction' toward my peers...it all seemed very foreign. Often, sexualized talk and jokes would make me uncomfortable, not because I think myself to be a prude, but because it didn't resonate with me. To this day

I guess my point is, but on the whole, I feel as if in some peculiar way I've retained so called 'childhood innocence'. In pondering this idea, interestingly enough, I've noticed that the characters in movies and stories I connect most with are usually either idealistic / 'free-flowing' adults or children.

Thus I have been wondering how much of a connection asexuality has to it all of this. Has a lack of a 'sexual perspective' in this world perpetuated innocence?

I'm a male, but I'm beginning to think I may indeed fit somewhere on that spectrum. While I'm not really out to label myself one way or another, I'm at the point where I feel like I need to at least talk about it, even if it's not to anyone I know personally, to help me understand myself better. 

I've never been in a committed relationship, and I kept that from going anywhere serious because I realized it wouldn't be a very viable relationship (issues with dissimilarity in personalities, interests, and so forth). I also didn't resolve that in a way that I'm particularly proud of, but what's done is done. My point here is that I don't have a good indication of whether I may or may not be demisexual, and while I obviously can't expect anyone to make that call for me, I figured it might be worth mentioning for background.

Anyway

1. Do you masturbate? If so, I tend to with relative frequency-- in fact until fairly recently I was pretty consistently masturbating every day or every other day, now I'd say I do it maybe 2-3 times a week. I certainly can't say I've done it exclusively to meet bodily needs-- I've done it out of boredom before, and it's not as if I find the sensation unpleasant.

2. For those of you in relationships with sexual partners, or is it a far more general disinterest? Thinking about it, I have to say that I cannot imagine myself enjoying most sexual acts-- the one possible exception being oral. Even then I'm certainly in no rush to experience it (or any other sexual act)-- at least not unless I'm heavily invested into a relationship (in which case I can imagine myself being generally compliant with whatever my partner wants).

3. For those of you who are romantic, do you at least enjoy being able to give them pleasure?

4. Perhaps most significantly, or did you realize after your first sexual encounter?

I guess my one worry is that I can't really know if I'm asexual without having experienced sex... part of me is concerned that I'm just making excuses for my lack of any intimate life and/or my personal insecurities in general. So I guess my last meta-question would be about that: based on your experiences, should I ""try it"" to find out?

I'm not quite sure why I'm writing this - I think I just wanted to get it off my chest or whatever.

When I was with my first boyfriend I identifed as asexual, read a few ace blog posts, identifed with them, and went on my way.

Eventually ""I found the right person"", and demisexual leaving me to identify as pansexual.

But yeah, have a lot of sympathy, and would kind of like to hang out at meetups or whatever (assuming I was welcome as a non-asexual). And I'm wondering if this little fact about my life is something I should just hide away?

tl;dr: How do you feel about people like me saying that they identifed as asexual for a number of years? Would you rather I deny my former identity because it plays into so many ace stereotypes

So I'm coming to terms with being somewhere in the gray ace spectrum. I still don't really know what I am but I think homoromantic gray is the best I can come up with (I'm a 20 year old guy in college). Just a little background to help explain my situation better: I have been in love before, because I was so into him emotionally. I basically would have done anything for this guy. Aside from that, I have had feelings for a few others, but it's usually pretty far and few between. I can get physically aroused by certain elements of a person's body, but any type of sex really generally is a huge turn off. I have never fantasized to anything actually sexual in my life, all fantasy and arousal typically comes from just the way somebody looks and no sex organs are ever involved. I do not watch porn ever (naked people generally turn me off big time), but I do have a libido that I tend to regularly. 95% of the time I want nothing to do with either touching another person or having another person touch me in any way. 

So as I said, even though I think these people are very aesthetically attractive in a physical sense. I want to be close to them emotionally and physically (as in hugging, kissing, holding hands, cuddling, etc..), I want to share myself with them, and I would not want to have to put that ""burden"" (I can't really think of a better word) on them. It just doesn't seem fair to them at all. I can't be like, sorry."" I want better for them. I almost feel better when I crush on an unattainable straight guy because I know that there's no chance of that happening. But when I find out a guy I like might be gay

Anyway, I am a little tired of getting sad whenever I like somebody because I still feel like even if they like me back, I probably can't give them what they need as a sexual person. And that's really frustrating. I'm not against having sexual experiences or anything, it's just extremely rare that I feel like it's right for me or it's something that I want.

OK so this girl (lets call her C) and I have been more or less involved for about a year and a half now. 

We met and hung out maybe once or twice before we went on maybe one or two dates before we entered into a relationship with titles and all that. (You know, if at all.

 In that time apart

Over the course of our relationship though she has become more and more reclusive and eventually decided that she is perfectly happy (more or less) with being a shut in/crazy cat lady and has figured out that she recognizes herself as an Asexual. She says that it is very rare she has sexual desires or even ones to kiss/hold hands/cuddle/make out. And if/when she does get a little excited it stops at her brain. For whatever reason the wires to go from her brain feeling horny to her body enjoying sex do not connect properly. Whenever she tries to get sexual with those feelings

Well this past week we had a ""talk"" and I laid my cards on the table about how I feel and what it is I want. (I really and unfortunately am in love with her and want to find someway to make a relationship work.) To me it seems like she's giving up and sticking in her comfort zone and not trying to grow as a person. She says she feels jealous of others when they talk about sex and love cuz she can't bring herself to get past that horrible feeling of sexual acts and intimacy. All that makes me think that there is a part of her that wants it too but she just needs to connect the wires in her brain to make that ""click"" and push through the brickwall. Although on the other hand
(And I want to be happy.) 

The end of the conversation was that we would continue seeing each other as friends and whatever else lightly-sexual things she felt comfortable doing. But I let her know that I planned on finding a way to make a relationship work between her and me. Perhaps finding a middle ground that could work for us somehow. 

All I know is that when I was younger I always was in a relationship for the goal of sex and losing my virginity but once I did (and not gonna lie

1.) I've never had a girlfriend 
2.) I was abused as a child
3.) I can't fantasize (or have no imagination)

Sometimes I can be aroused by women who are purposely being sexually inciting, it's usually just me trying to fantasize about something that's supposed to arouse me, but I can't keep the image of an attractive woman in my head for longer than a second, so I just lay there and get it over with. Literally, my imagination is non-existent. Sometimes I just masturbate to myself too, but I somewhat obsess over my body (that's a different story). 

I feel awkward when my friends talk about sex, I find it difficult to even have sex with a girl, I just can't stay hard once we start. I'm not sure why, but it's happened twice now. I wasn't even seeking to have sex with them either, but both times they came on to me and my friends encouraged me. The two girls were very attractive, but they weren't even the type of girls I would consider to be my friend, more like the stereotypical attractive girl with nothing intelligent to say - not my type. I physically can't have sex with a girl if I don't like her, even if she's attractive. 

The weird thing is, and who doesn't want to have sex/be friends with me just because of my body. I just want someone to kind of connect with. It's been probably 2-3 years since I last tried to have sex with a woman, but I don't care to, nor do I put myself in a position to meet women. I'm content with my current situation, but I wouldn't mind a girlfriend, just to be around and talk to and hang out. The only reason I've been bothered lately is because one of my friends asked me if I was gay because, and I don't think I am. I'm pretty sure I'm compatible with women, and if I recall I might have been a little grossed out by the act. I guess I'm just frustrated because everyone just talks about sex

I'm tired of hanging out with my guy friends. And I usually only met women through my guy friends

tl;dr: Am I asexual? I can't (physically) have sex with random attractive women, kinda want a girlfriend anyway, the girls in my friend circle or introduced from the circle are too wild, I realized that I'm technically not asexual because I have a sex drive and want a girlfriend.

All throughout high school I wasn't interested in dating. I could look at a guy and find him physically attractive

I went through the motions of dating till I met my now ex husband. (I grew up Mormon so there was never pressure for premarital sex. Sex, etc. were off limits.) I didn't allow myself to question my sexuality much till I became really close to my ex after dating him for months. In my early 20's I finally experienced real sexual attraction for someone. I even remember thinking to myself, ""Oh this is what it's like to be normal!"" At the time I didn't even know what asexuality was. 

Long story shorter, I started dating non-mormons. My ex was different in that he didn't even kiss me till we dated for 3 months. My friends pointed out to me how weird that was, but at the time I didn't find it weird. In fact, I felt like he waited till just the perfect time. These new guys are wanting kisses after the second, sometimes first date. For a while I thought I was just broken, or wounded from my divorce. Then I heard something about asexuality. I struggled for months, wondering if it were possible to be asexual, then asexual again. I tried experimenting (horrible I know) by kissing random guys (even a couple girls) who'd flirt with me at parties

For two years I kept this mystery about me on hold thinking I just needed the right guy. Then I met the ""right guy."" I've known him almost a year, I'm super comfortable with him, but he's a sexual person. Because I was trying to respect him, I wouldn't kiss him (outside of a friendly peck) because I felt I would be leading him on. (Remember I didn't know of demisexuality. I thought my lack of attraction was me not liking him but wishing I did.) I tried explaining to him that I wasn't sexually attracted to him and I didn't know why. He was very understanding given my odd behavior and we tried dating. That only lasted a week until I got officially friend-zoned and was replaced by a girl who wanted to cuddle with him, who wanted sex with him, who held his hand, and would kiss him openly. This hurt. 
And here in lies the problem! 

(TLDR) Discovered demisexuality a week ago

I'm a wonderful wing woman. I'm the best gal friend a guy could ever have. But I want something more. 
If I start dating a guy, he friend-zones me or runs to a girl that will have sex with him before anything can start.
Do I kiss them anyway? Even when I don't feel anything? Do I force sex when after a while it might turn out that I actually *don't* like the person like that? 

How do I go about dating when the guy gives up so soon due to a lack of intimacy on my part? I am an attractive girl
I tried explaining demisexuality to a couple of my close friends

Any advice?

The thing is

Anyone have any suggestions? I'm pretty sure that a decent number of the people in my life just think the reason I don't date or display any real sexual drive is because I'm in the closet- which doesn't even make sense because I'll admit pretty freely to being bi- but I just say that I'm not really interested in dating anyone. Which is true

One of the other major concerns I have is that because I don't really feel sexual attraction I won't know what to do/how to have sex and I'll REALLY suck at it. Honestly the idea isn't repulsive to me- but I feel like I would have sex the same way I would give a back massage or play soccer. It would be a physical activity that would be fine but not something I ""needed"" the way most people seem to.

The thing is since I don't experience sexual attraction I'm pretty much too scared to do it since I don't trust that that instinct thing that tells people what to do will be there for me.

I'm 30 years old, sexual relationship with a male for about 11 years that recently ended. Since I jumped into an LTR so young and was mostly attracted to men, I just kind of assumed I was a straight, ""normally"" sexual girl. Though I definitely have had attraction to women, it wasn't as strong as attraction to men. I should also mention that me and my ex did have breaks that allowed me to date other people, but none as serious or long term as the relationship that just ended. Here I should mention that I rarely ever cared about sex. Though I do experience sexual attraction, my sex drive is faint and I am pretty much okay with not having any sex at all. However, and I've been told more than a couple times that I am good in bed. 

But. My ltr essentially ended because he always felt insecure about our sexual experience. I never orgasm, at least not like he was. He stayed with me for years, but ultimately, I think he realized I would never change. And that was the dealbreaker.  

Now. I am definitely romantic. I want a ltr, especially in the light of my recent breakup, the more I wonder if maybe I am somewhere on the asexual spectrum.

And if this is the case -- as I am slowly beginning to suspect -- how do I deal with it? I can essentially play at being sexual

So, on how to introduce the idea to partners, on how to reassure them that yes -- I find them sexy and attracted and I do want them, but that sex is just a neutral thing for me.

This all occurred directly before the gay rights explosion

Suffice to say, to a degree, this label applied to me. However, I was not attracted to men, never in my life have I had such feelings. However, I also found myself disgusted with PDA, and did not see anything attractive about the female of the species.

Then, the way people reacted, etc. Mirrored my feelings EXACTLY. I then decided to check up on trusty 'ole reddit, and here I am today. Proud Ace.

Some context: I'm female; my husband and I are both 25 (we just got married 5 months ago but we've been together for almost 6 years).

Once upon a time, and I loved being able to make him feel good. I had been a virgin and really sort of freaked out by sex before I met him... I dreaded the idea of it, I'd heard it would hurt, and I couldn't figure out how it all worked -- was afraid it wouldn't feel good. Still, I watched pornography and masturbated a lot and felt sexual arousal watching people becoming aroused.

But when I started seeing him, like every day I couldn't wait to see him and do it. 

Then things started changing... it's hard to explain. Maybe I should fast forward to now. At this point it's been three years since I've had a functional sex life with my husband. I still love him; in fact

I have been thinking that a number of factors may have contributed to this

* I have put on weight since then and I feel self-conscious about my changing body
* I used to find my husband incredibly attractive and now I'm sort of desensitized to his physical appearance. I notice his zits
* We moved back to our respective parents' homes for 2 years after graduating college
* I get chronic and painful UTIs as a result of sex -- not fun.

But there's another piece of the puzzle. Something that has to do with just being totally indifferent to sexual satisfaction -- I can achieve orgasm on my own

I do still get horny. And I very much enjoy the sensation of orgasm. But I'm not particularly excited about achieving orgasm with my husband. I do sometimes feel aroused when I'm er

I've never felt any sort of sexual attraction. I don't even know what that is like. I look at other people and they all just look like people. Neither males or females really stand out. People talk about how that girl looks cute or that guy looks cute

I honestly don't know if people are really attractive or not.

I do also have a high lean towards males. They are who i feel romantic feelings for 90% of the time

I've had sex before. The physical things were kinda uncomfortable to me. There was some pleasure

In fact

It was from hypomania from bipolar taking a minor sexual drive into an overwelming need. but it wasn't just that

It was something else. I love making people feel good. I'll use my body for that. The emotional high that I get from seeing those people so pleased was worth it. It felt so good seeing people happy like that. 

I mean there are other things that I enjoy

I do have a desire for sex. An instinct. But it isn't really directed towards people. The only reason why I am sexual with other people is to make them feel good. The instinct itself is like.. i dunno. It is like a bad itch and you have to get rid of it.

Sexual people don't understand my lack of attraction. Most asexuals I have talked to don't understand my sex drive despite the lack of physical enjoyment.

What i get out of sex are things like the compliments. The positive energy that the other person has. It is hard to explain, it is just handy to do.

I also do find ways to enjoy it despite the physical uncomfortableness. Things like the feeling of being in control or having lack of it I enjoy. I also enjoy inflicting pain and having it inflicted on me. 

I just don't feel like i really fit in anywhere. I have sex

To start, it seems I lack even the ability to be physically aroused. (Which isn't entirely accurate, but it's very difficult &amp; a rare occurrence to the point of being non-existent). Of course, despite this I still have a mental desire to sleep with people (in the context of a meaningful relationship!) and enjoy it. It appears that I am asexual, but I don't want to be! I feel like I am missing out on some awesome part of life because my biology hates me. :( 


I don't know though. Sometimes it feels like I am jumping the gun when I try to label myself. I don't have a lot of dating experience, ""Ohh, so this is what it feels like!"" moment. And it was a nice feeling, one that I want more of, haha.


I've heard the term demisexual thrown around and maybe that applies to me? I'm a pretty big introvert and have a lot of social anxiety. The thought of kissing a person I didn't feel in love with, so I think there will be a lot more opportunities. I'm only interested in dating other girls, which my community college is not exactly full of. 


To end, and yet ironically I'm not really sure what the heck it is that I'm hiding! I'm also scared of the prospect of trying to date girls and not even being confident in my identity and what I'm doing. I feel like a small, pathetic child. Plus I don't really think it's fair to put somebody else through all of my confusion like some experiment. Ughhh.

I'm a 16 year old male and I recently began identifying as asexual. I haven't told any of my close friends or family. I'm currently in a summer program and I have told a few people here.

I was struggling to understand my sexuality for a while

I'm pretty sure that my close friends have some notion of my sexuality. I also think that my family is convinced that I was straight; they always ask me if I've met any cute girls

My biggest fear with coming out is that I've definitely led people to think I'm straight. My friends and family are very tolerant

My family and I also never really talked about sex; I never had the talk with them. I learned at my school's sex education program. I think that might be why I'm having some difficulties.

I'm a woman attracted to men but without strong sexual overtones. I am also attracted to woman. I just think beautiful people are nice to look at. But I have no sexual drive or inspiration to take action. If one of these attractive people starts hitting on me (which has happened and is incredibly awkward) I'm immediately aware that sex is something I don't want and find a way to inch away.

I've only had 1 significant sexual relationship. It was with a man I was friends with for 1 year. He asked me if I wanted to be in a relationship and I was feeling lonely (kind of ashamed to admit it) so I thought why not. I found I could do the sex thing and I did feel drive when I got the gears going. But I wanted sex a lot less frequently than he did and when we broke up

I don't feel my lack of desire to have sex implies I love people any less than anyone else. I have very strong emotions and am picky about the types of people I like to have in my life. I am a social creature and do like people. But I feel guilty about making significant connections with men because I am worried that I can't satisfy them. I feel anxiety about having a conversation with anyone - male or female - about my sexual preferences. I just keep telling people I haven't found the right person yet.

I told a few people I was bi and then later that year came out as gay. 

When I was about 15 I joined some gay hook-up sites because I was curious. I hooked up with a few guys to try and figure out my sexuality. I've always felt different because I didn't want what everyone did. I wanted the boy that appears in every romantic comedy ever made. The guy that connects with you on a deeper level and understands you. You have fun together

I've had enough sex with guys to figure out that I was going through the motions because that's what everyone expected. When I got to college

Sorry this is kind of a stream of consciousness. I do that a lot. But I guess I'm just looking for some answers. How do you even begin to form romantic relationships when society says that there is sex in relationships? The part I'm confused about is that I still find guys sexually attractive in the sense that I find beards sexy, penisssss, whatever you know what i mean) sometimes are nice to see. But in my ideal world, my boyfriend/husband and I are connected on a very deep emotional level, we cuddle while watching movies, we occasionally kiss to show affection, and we cuddle falling asleep together.

Sex to me is like acting on a stage. You play the character how they are meant to be played even if it isn't you. I know how to make a guy think I'm very sexually attracted to him so we can have sex. I kinda cringe my teeth and take it because it's ""normal"". God I fucking hate that word. 

Once again I started ranting. Sorry. I don't know.

I don't even know what I want to get out of this post. I say I'm looking for answers but I kinda just want someone to understand. People have never really seen the ""real"" me because

Example: I've been through a suicidal phase in my life and I think it has expanded my mind. Knowing what it feels like to be in so much pain that you cut, people become really scared for me and wonder if something is still wrong. No, I'm not suicidal anymore but it was a part of my life and therefore a part of me. I feel the same way about my sexuality. People won't understand how I don't want to suck anyone's dick or fuck anyone. I just want that romantic relationship. And then people become concerned. 

Ranting again. I think this post is finally ending though. Again

I've never really developed a sex drive or understood why everyone else devoted so much time and effort to sex. For a while I just assumed I was slow to develop sexually

I certainly am hetro-romantic. I like girls

I had one long term relationship with a girl, cuddling, and light kissing. Our relationship was wired because we did fight about sex.
I never tried to make her have it or wanted it immediately
I figured trying sex would be the easiest way to do this, but was against kids from any source.

* I feel always very conscious of

* I am drawn to/notice particularly girls with short hair. Especially blondes. Very especially androgynous-looking blondes. But I don't know if this is just because I'm being reminded of my ex (blonde androgyne)

* Yeah

* I am really attracted to this (straight) girl

* I recently met a (questioning, because she's blonde and has very short hair. And I feel guilty about that too, because if it's actually happening then I'm only liking her because she reminds me of someone I like.

* I like looking at female bodies more than I like looking at male ones. By a good margin.

* I think I'm demisexual, so I don't know if I'm *really* a/sexual or not.

The asexual(ish) bit makes it difficult to find out, and see if I feel anything. The low frequency at which I get crushes doesn't help too...

I know I shouldn't care because these are just labels, the LGBTQ community is very fierce, fabulous and...very non-questioning - very certain of their individual identities. (And quite sexual.

It makes me want to run away. It makes me want to be sick. It makes me want to hide. I hate everything about myself

I know my self-loathing is frequently irrational. I have been in treatment for depression and anxiety for a couple of years, I feel more hopeless than ever regarding the possibility of a love life. No doctor I have spoken to has taken these concerns seriously. They seem to think it will all go away once I find the right guy. But every time I meet someone who I consider attractive, all I can think about is how I don't want him to see how ugly I am. I think about how horrible it would be to be naked in front of someone else, to have him really see me. I think it sounds terrifying and awful. I think I would rather die. 

I don't know if I'm asexual or demisexual or just held down by my own self-loathing. I do know that as more of my friends start to settle down into long-term relationships, more than anything, to have a significant other.

However, I have noticed that my male friends have been much more vocal this year about seeking relationships and talking about how attractive different girls are, and I continually play along even though I don't really want to do so, simply because I don't want to go to the trouble of explaining that I am asexual and don't really know what else to do in that situation.

I would prefer to just let things be and avoid labeling myself, one girl with whom I am extremely close told me that she thinks bisexual people are in denial about their sexuality. I can't see that she would feel any differently about asexuality. I would also be horrified if anything ever came back to my parents and I was forced to have that conversation with them.

But, I remember looking down at this person, and the thought ""I don't want to be here,"" first crossed my mind. And I realized hours later that I've always had a reluctance to have sex. Always. I used to think it was just simple anxiety about my performance or something, I began to realize that every time I've had sex I've felt that I wasn't doing something right because I wouldn't make the right noises, was taken aback whenever he'd hear of my horrible, so yes


And this kinda stuck with me for a few years. I'd feel shame, so there was an easy rationalization). I never realized that I'd just part-way reconciled with the fact that I don't need sex. The reason this was so hard to realize clearly is because everyone around me is always going on about sex, and I was aroused seeing men who had sex, so the 'ergo' seems pretty obvious. It didn't help that I wasn't having a lot of it, so I didn't really understand. Even before I had had ANY sex, I knew and told everyone I knew that cared to listen, that I wasn't the type of guy for one-night stands. I always said I needed to know a guy really well if I ever wanted to fuck him. This is combined with the fact that I wasn't 'good in bed.'

Anyway as it seems to really explain a big part of why I' e felt so isolated all my life

First I brought it up with my identical twin (who is certainly not asexual). He was generally accepting but wondered if it might be because I dated a girl who was asexual (also celibate for religious reasons too I guess), and after my relationship with this girl. Overall I was pretty satisfied with the way things went.

A few days ago I opened up to my long time therapist
Anyway he also was suggesting I probably was a late bloomer (I'm 25 so I highly doubt that) or that it could be caused by issues I have with social anxiety keeping my sexual urges repressed. I guess his points bothered me because while I don't feel they are the cause I can't prove they aren't. He also suggested I may grow out of it at some point, and I know it's all because of a sexually released flood of oxytocin that makes them feel what they describe as love. I don't want it, I don't want the emotional turmoil, I don't want my romantic relationships to be propped up by sex hormones, I want an intileftual and emotional relationship based on trust, openness, and compatability

The two options I've thought of are

2. E-mail him, ask him to review them, and ask that we discuss it next time we meet.

While I'm still a bit fuzzy on the definition of sexual attraction I feel comfortable identifying as ace. What I am more confused about is the definition or romantic attraction.

I found out I was asexual last summer and began identifying as heteroromantic. Then I realized I didn't really have any urge to go out and start a relationship with someone (I was not opposed to being in one though)

Now I'm wondering if I'm aromantic. A few months back, buys her presents, does everything that, I'm now finding out, a boyfriend is 'supposed' to do.

As a Christian I'll be expected to 'be the man' in any relationship I enter into

I still like the idea of being in a relationship and maybe getting married (but never having sex because it's icky), so maybe I don't even really care to be friends with her... maybe I just think she's pretty and nice and that's the extent of my attraction.

Does that sound like aromantic? It seems like I feel some sort of romantic attraction but after seeing what my brother has to do in the name of romance maybe the attraction isn't romantic at all. Maybe I should just forget about labels and stop trying to get into boxes that don't fit... I'll be like a tumbleweed

And after talking with her a bit I felt we were pretty compatible.  I'm very attracted to artistic types, as well as people who are a little bit goofy.  She definitely fit the bill in our online chats.  After some correspondence I suggested we meet IRL.  She agreed. 

We met for coffee (or at least I had coffee, which was a few hours after meeting.  From there we hung out at least once a week, sometimes more.  I'd say (at first) we hit it off.

I wouldn't say I fell head-over-heels, so it was nice to have people to spend it with).

Now for the reason why I'm turning to r/asexuality with my situation.  After a few dates I started to notice somethings.  I should first state I'm not a very aggressive guy when it comes to intimacy, when walking I tried to getting a little closer to her when walking around or sitting down.  I also tried small touching gestures to show my interest (my hand over her hand across the table, playful/flirting pushes).

While she didn't spurn my advances, but she didn't turn it to fit into mine or return the gesture.  Sometimes, she would sit next to me, other times away from me, no real consistency.  I think the situation that threw me for the biggest loop was when we were watching a movie and talking and I leaned against her legs slightly.  She didn't move away (a clear indication of not being interested in my opinion) but she didn't react to the gesture at all.

Things went on like this for a couple of months.  Suddenly she stopped texting me and we didn't hang out for about a month.  She messaged me out of the blue to get together.  We hung out once after that and resumed texting.  But

I was spurred on by a post I just read about demisexuality to write one of my own. I hate to be that person who asks for clarification on orientation

I am a 22yo gay guy. I've had a lot of experiences with sex with guys, but I never wanted to climax during it. It was always about them, and often I'd have to really struggle to make myself cum. They could never make me do it.

When I went to college, but my sole interest throughout all of these was to make the other person cum. I really like doing that, but am not interested in cumming myself. I was not sexually attracted to any of these people, and only really did it for fear of missing out. 

I have been having a sexual relationship with a guy for a few years now. We were friends originally (still are just friends, but slowly it became mutual, and now we have full on sex and it is really good. This is the only sex I've ever had that is good, and the only person I've really fantasised about since my late teens. I have long felt that the emotional aspect of the relationship is what makes the sex work.

With others, it is sometimes a struggle to maintain. I've spoken to my doctor, who says it is probably psychological, however I am wondering if maybe I am somewhat of what I believe is called a 'demisexual'.

I am romantically attracted to guys, and at worst, disgusting. I am terribly sorry for the long post, but any reflection, advice, or experiences any of you have had would be so helpful to me. Thank you all in advance, and take care :)

For a long time I have noticed that I lack the drive to have sex. I do find some men good looking (sexy, but never thought *I want to have sex with him*. Also, I'm more interested in other kind of intimacy, like hugging, cuddling, kissing and so forth, but not sex. I do have sex fantasies to help with... er... *self-help*.

I do suffer from depression (but now it is under control) and I thought that my lack of sex drive would be because of the depression. Then again

So

I am sexually active and am dating a wonderful man whom I love very much. I do not necessarily enjoy sex, but I do not like the idea of actually having sex. I have tried masturbation with no success. I find both women and men attractive (I would identify myself as straight), but more of through recognition of their beauty rather than for sexual reasons. I find my partner very attractive, though, but I believe it is due to the emotion connection. 

It is a long distance relationship, I don't even feel penetration, however.

I still want to continue having sex because it makes my partner happy

I've never been old enough to experience sexual desire AND been off antidepressants. I think the medicine MAY be the cause of this seeing as I had that one crush. But it was a childhood crush
What may be the case is that the antidepressants have dulled my sexual desire so low that it's essentially asexuality. BUT I've been on antidepressants since before puberty

1366565080.0,1ct3zj,Help! Childless and guiltfree?,dichternebel,11,2,9,"Hey everyone

although I only just registered

I need to rant about something and would also be grateful for any advice

First off, I might be aromantic. Yesterday, my older sister told me that she was pregnant. I'm very happy for her and her partner, they're doing this at the right point of their lives, they have a wonderful relationship and I know that they're going to make great parents. I'm also so excited to meet the baby and see my sister become a mother!

I'm not ""out"" to anyone but my best friend, I don't want to explain my sexual orientation to everyone and their uncle Joe, I don't feel the need to explain it to anyone in my circle because my best friends respect my partnerless lifestyle without questioning it and I don't care about the rest of the world. Part of me also doesn't feel ready to be ""out"", I had a really hard time accepting my asexuality and sometimes I still feel sad because I've always been ""different"" and got my fair share of mobbing for it when I was 11 or 12. I recognise that humans have a tendency to hate what they perceive to be different and it scares me sometimes. I think I would need to feel comfortable talking about it before entering a relationship though, the last few times I thought I was in love was linked to much anxiety about the expectations coming with a relationship (this was before I started realising I was asexual though).

So, the thought of having a partner seems strange to me, the thought of ME having sex is somewhat repulsive and the thought of pregnancy is highly uncomfortable because it's such a feminine thing. I'd go nuts always having to look down on a babybelly, even my boobs jiggling makes me really uncomfortable most of the time.

I come from a country with a low rate of childbirth and my family shows this trend very well. Half of my aunts and uncles don't have children and I only have one cousin. My grandmother was always very sad about this. I also have an aunt who's very sweet and was successful on a professional level, of poor health and absolutely passive about this state. She just complains about it a lot which gets on everyones nerves because she never DOES anything to change anything. A little bit of sports would help a great deal. Also, she sometimes hurts someone and never acknowledges it or apologises. We almost had a huge family fight because of that last summer. She loves to casually tell me that we are very much alike, when I was younger, I thought this was great, now that I'm older, I'm horrified. I do see certain parallels but I don't ever want to become like her! My sister and her partner like and support her

Upon learning that my sister was pregnant, out of pity probably. And I really don't want to become that person. I try to tell myself ""No, you're going to be the cool aunt that travels the world"" but I'm so so afraid that my aunt is right and I will become her. The odd one out that you visit and invite because you want to be a good person. Also, despite my parents being very supportive of everything I do, I feel that I'm going to be a bit of a disappointment because I'll never have my own family.

Thank you for reading this far and if you have any idea what I could do to feel better about this

Basically I have been toying with the idea that I might be a Demi asexual for quite a while. I used to be a very horny and sexual teenager but slowly over the past 10 years my desire for sex is shrinking

I consider asexuality to be similar to a sexual oriantation

The problem is that I am not very well educated on exactly what constitutes human asexuality. How do I know if I am an asexual or if I am a sexual person who is experiencing a condition that is affecting my libido?

I used to be a very sexual person

I would be quite happy to just formally close my vagina and say 'I'm asexual"" because that's how I feel and I think that would make me quite happy. But at the same time I think I will grief the old sexual me. I think It would deeply affect my relationship with my husband who is sexual.

I started developing a low libido following vulvodynia (genital pain) I still suffer it so sex/vaginal contact is painful and I have no desire to do it. Along with that, touching and all sorts of sexual intimacy has become innate or 'dirty' the sensation on my skin either causes no more pleasure than bumping into a wall or it makes me feel like I am being raped by my own father, I feel gross.

I have 'waves' of horniness that lead me to give oral or digital sex to my partner, I think of hugging my partner or snuggling. Anyway, this post is getting far too long, so I'll just stop before I vent too much. Thanks for reading.

**tl;dr: Trying to work out what separates an asexual person from a sexual person with a serious physiological/medical libido issue.**

* Has anyone had experiences with slowly transitioning from a happy sexual person to a happy asexual person who misses their sexy days?

1. Is there a difference between asexuality and a low/lack of a sex drive? Something tells me that there's more to it
2. On this note, because I'm not insinuating that sex is the cornerstone of love (nor do I feel that it is), and I'm not saying that you can only really love someone if you want to get into their pants. I'm not sure what I'm saying. I guess I want to know, for those of you who seek romantic relationships but want no part of sex in any form, do you feel this compromises the strength of the love you can have for another? The relationship seems to more resemble a friendship, which I'm not saying is weaker, but something deep inside of me is screaming that it is. Do you feel that your relationship is any different than one that does involve sex? 
3. How can you tell that asexuality is not a hormone imbalance? What sets them apart? (I am aware I may get flak for this question
4. Do you see sex as something disgusting? Or something you just couldn't care less about? Is it something that you don't desire but still get pleasure from?
5. Even more subjectively, I still think that sexual desire plays a role in that strong infatuation. It's more simply just thinking, ""Oh, she really attractive.""—I do the same with males (I can see them as very attractive) yet I don't develop crushes on males. There is some sort of lust there (though not necessarily sexual)—do you experience it?

This wasn't a conscious decision I came to. My disinterest in sex feels as natural and instinctive as the feelings of sexual arousal do, and always has, and feels even more integral to who I am. I can pretty easily imagine a version of me who's sexually aroused by men or by nothing but is still fundamentally the same person I am now, whereas a version of me who's actively heterosexual feels much more alien

Am I asexual? It seems like a weird word to apply to myself when I do feel sexual arousal and have sexual fantasies (albeit rather detached and abstract ones), a lifestyle, rather than an innate trait, and I didn't choose to have no interest in sexual activity with women, any more than I chose to feel no sexual arousal from looking at men.

In my 16th birthday, so to speak. Because my dad was very hands-on, he was waiting downstairs so I texted him that I was not aroused (pretty stupid, I know). Then, his hooker-girlfriend went up (not part of the plan, ew, i know). I now had two girls servicing me - and I still could not get it up.

Eventually, fucking her felt perfunctory - there was no thrill(?), rush or even desire to fuck her. I ended up being deflated minutes later - not because I came but because I was not aroused.

I had told my dad that I had the best night of my life - blah blah

1329798911.0,pyvlr,TL;DR I might be stuck in a deep relationship with an asexual partner. Please help me.,throwawaygoodness,13,5,16,"Hi Reddit (you and all your subreddits rock

I am looking for some help.

**TL;DR I might be stuck in a deep relationship with an asexual partner. Please help me figure things out

I am a male in a wonderful relationship with a woman. We have been together for 10 years

We met in my mid 20s, and cuddle, and were romantic, cute, mushy, and sweet. Tons of our friends, and numerous strangers (including one super old lady in a nursing home) would talk about us as being such a wonderful match. We just clicked on a very deep level. I was not a virgin, it was 5 years of a close monogamous relationship till marriage. 

We had an attempt at sex wedding night, and lacked any desire to get into it. Over time, she consistently used numerous excuses to not have sex. About once a month she had a quick flash of desire for sex (ovulation as she was wetter). These 1-2 day forays would end up not happening if she was working those days. So there would be times of 2 months or more with no sex. If we did end up having sex they tended to be sporadic with her desire or ability for me to bring her to an orgasm. I would usually need to give her an orgasm (finger, oral, vibrator, massage, bath, get her into it, her game was that she would try to play with me before I inserted her to get me to a point where I was so heightened I'd cum in her in under 1-2 minutes (she is actually proud of this). This pattern continued for all 5 years of our marriage. The last few years she's been complaining how her old friends have multiple kids

I want to clarify a bit about our relationship. We are extremely happy in our relationship. We have not had a major fight in 10 years. I mean this in all sincerity. We communicate about everything. We have gone through some extremely stressful life situations. The passing of my grandmother who was the closest person to me throughout my whole life, we read almost each weekend when she is not working where we cuddle up on the couch (magazines, books, newspapers), we have community that we are part of and are active with. We have many similar tastes, from food to entertainment. We have family on each side that we love. In short our marriage is a happy ball of wax, with the exception of our utterly sexless life. 

She has not had any sort of sexual trauma to warrant this, I will add a few things about my past sexual tastes, it's not the issue and I am extremely attuned to my partners in bed. I have an insatiable sexual appetite. I need to masturbate close to 4 -5 times a week. Before her, I would have sex at least a few times a week, or more. I am pansexual (attracted to bi, gay, trans, have fetishes that range from vanilla to all sorts of levels of BDSM (I am a very good Dom as well as switch). I have had long sex escapades with the ability to give multiple orgasms to multiple partners or have had sex every day or multiple times a day. I believe that I understand how to push the mental buttons and physical buttons to ride up to an orgasm and I understand enough to hold onto it over time to maintain the bliss throughout sex. I am an incredible romantic as well. Cerebral and intellectual and use them to bring emotional comfort. I cater to her needs, take baths with her, as well as clean the home. I write poetry

I have made all sorts of attempts over time, and straight up about my feelings want or being desired. I purchased all sorts of toys to let her choose one that might break the spell. Bought lingerie and let her dominate and control the bedroom games. No does not masturbate, No Porn. We went to the OBGYN (no short cervix or internal mush). I talked dirty to her and teased her for a few days to get her horny. Gave hints. Or remind her it's been a month since we had sex. Her responses rotate, but she always gets a bit agitated. I hate feeling like I am pushing her. 2-3 months may pass and no sex and then when an off week comes close I tell her in advance that we should have sex, as usual, I let her choose the times and then don't push her and not bring it up again as the week passes. She never makes a move or brings it up. She's not busy, general vacation stuff. Sometimes I let it go, and the excuses are lame. No Sex. I let it slide. Sometimes I will deliberately show her I am not happy

I have taken up hobbies to control my frustration. I started to paint and create. It is not used to separate us, gay men can be more promiscuous, bi men, polyamorous couples, BDSM situations can be very open, etc). I have come very close to following through, but just can't seem to do it to my 10 year relationship. 

I considered polyamoury

She genuinely works very hard. Some of her days and weeks are extremely brutal on her. But

I love her too much to end our marriage. 

Please help me to clarify if this is a potential asexual situation. 
If so
Is there any hope for me? i.e. are there ways to rectify my selfish sexual concerns with her? 
Is there something else entirely that this might be (just on my end

OK. I'm verbally spewing here for a bit. Throughout this note

I'm really tired of all of the gay-hate going around. Yes. I am intolerant of intolerance. I know,999,999 times out of 10,000,000). I'm probably going to lose friends for this, but I'm OK with that. I had people de-friend me after I simply changed my profile picture to show that I was a straight-ally. I expect no less now that I'm actually taking a real stand AND explaining WHY I take the position that I do on this issue. 

Why do I take such a strong position on, regardless of their gender. I could say it's because I believe in equal protection under the law for ALL, and that as long as there are civil rights and benefits/considerations based upon marital status, that marital status should be available to all consenting adults regardless of gender or orientation. 

Some of the arguments I've heard are just ridiculous…""if homosexuality is a civil right, and/or bestiality would one day also be declared a ""civil right.""  And, next thing you know, men (I only specify because that's how the argument has been presented to me, without fail) won't be able to marry ""little boys"" because 1) pedophilia is still illegal, and 2) even if by some strange turn of events, it wasn't, that argument is invalid. 

However, for the purpose of procreation."" If that's the case, then take away my right to get married right here, right now. I've got at least two, maybe three strikes against me. 

STRIKE #1 - I am not heterosexual. Now, I like guys, I like cuddling and all that romantic, mushy stuff…but that's it. And I am OK with that. Let me explain it in a way some of you will understand: 

""For asexuals, or think the donut is disgusting— many of us even like donuts. But we never have any urge to walk over there and eat it. Demisexuals will have the urge to eat the donut only if it their absolute favorite kind of donut in the whole world, and greysexuals sometimes will have the urge to get the donut, and sometimes not. Celibates are on diets.""

For a long time, I'm probably not having kids, because…well, certain activities are a pre-requisite to makin' babies. 

STRIKE #2 - Medically, I'm putting enough info out here as it is….), I probably cannot have kids.  Again, this is something that, thankfully, I am OK with. I have great respect for those who do wish to have kids, and do whatever they can to make it happen. I can't begin to imagine the emotional toll it can take to face your deepest desire and not be able to fulfill it. That being said, 1) I just …. don't…. and 2) I have other things that I deal with that

So….there it is…if marriage is for one man and one woman, the button is right there on my profile. If you want to have intelligent conversation about this, I'd be happy to…I'd welcome it, even.

Well, I began functioning normal again. I'm talking about some *LIMITLESS* kind of shit going on in my brain:

* I noticed things I'd never seen before (just little things that most people take for granted like EXIT signs

* I began enunciating and pronouncing every word while carefully picking what to say in advance without sounding stupid (I slur my words like crazy and frequently use wrong words)

* I made very calculated and controlled moments

* The cloudiness in my brain was lifted and I swear my IQ must have increased briefly because I was able to process things I never previously could. As a computer scientist

* I was able to talk to people with extremely high confidence and was able to pick up on social cues I previously would have missed. I was able to keep on topic and made sure not to interrupt people.

* I became overly enthusiastic about everything. Normally when this happens

With all of this came another odd side-effect... I became extremely horny and I very badly wanted to have sex with a woman.

Now

I won't lie or hide any of the above

The point is that I count myself as asexual because the term

My rationale for this is that we GENERALLY (yes, or homo-romantic when they say that they are heterosexual, bisexual, or homosexual. We aren't overly fussed if everyone is not (potentially obsessively) making sure their label is entirely accurate with regards to the complex mish-mash that is their sex and romantic lives.

To that extent, it's out anybody's hands.

So when I say I'm asexual

I'm not interested in calling myself homo-romantic with severe but not total Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder. It's simply more convenient to describe myself as a gay asexual.

That is my personal view.

However

I somewhat wonder if we grant ourselves enough time to worrying about being happy with who we are and the decisions we take about accepting that. For example

I'm not saying that's necessarily bad

So here's the deal: I'm a young guy and I masturbate to heterosexual porn frequently, but I couldn't get up fully and then came prematurely. Anyway, both of these relationships were cut short by me not being able to connect with my own desires and express them. By the same token, I'm never really attracted to guys outside the realm of fantasy, and I've never even felt a touch of lust for avowed gays I've known. Imagining myself with another person has never been fully gratifying, be it a man or a woman.

I know it may be that I need to develop strong romantic relationships before I can get sexual; I have troubled getting attached to people at all. It may be that I repress homosexual feelings, I might just be asexual, but I find that disheartening. I want to please and be pleased by a lover. I want to feel love.

For the time being

Some other notes: I'm mildly depressed most of the time because I have depersonalization disorder. In a sense, I went into a homosexual phase, and when I realized how I felt, I had severe anxiety attacks. And after that, I considered myself bisexual for a long time. Still capable of being attracted to both sexes, but, given my inability to consummate these real forced feelings, 'Should I notch asexuality onto the ole belt?'

He is still a virgin. (27 years old) In my head I just think he is shy and uncomfortable about sex since he has never done it. But

I tried asking him why he wasn't interested in sex. This only infuriated him. He said he didn't want to be interrogated by me. For the first time he said we should probably just break up.

Some more history:

He has no desire to have children.

He would watch porn when he was young. But

He never tried to get off until his early 20. He only tried to achieve an orgasm because I was miffed that he never had a desire to.

Myself and him blamed it on his sheltered religious upbringing.

The only reason he will give me why he doesn't want to have sex is because he has a low body image. He doesn't care if he is a virgin for the rest of his life because of it.

I first thought he just had a low testosterone level since he can't grow a beard. But

I don't think he is broken and want to fix him. If he was asexual it would bring me a great deal of comfort not having to think I just wasn't doing it for him and he was going to look for some one else.

I don't know how to bring this up with him with out upsetting him. Is it some thing we should even discuss since I am totally comfortable with it.

My friends aren't idiots, are even less aware of LGBTQIA issues in general, and I get the feeling that they think this is a phrase.

Basically, and up until recently I just thought I hadn't met the ""right person"" that would make me all tingly inside. I have dated both men and women, and ultimately I decided that I was a ""romantic asexual"" as the term seems to be (correct me if I'm wrong). I desire a close, romantic relationship with someone (gender nonwithstanding), and I adore cuddling and kissing, but when things fall below the waist I feel uncomfortable, turned off

Fast forward to the present. I still am looking for people to date

Right now I am dating a guy that is pretty amazing. We have so much in common, which make me feel like crap about the whole thing.

So, links, or whatever you guys can provide. How do you start this conversation? Is it best to be candid, or is there some other subject that I can use to segue into my views. I think that I would be willing to go through with sex ultimately for someone that I loved, but I'm not at this point with him yet, and how do I tell him that without hurting his feelings, or worse, it is super easy for me to talk about these things in text-form on the internet

I also feel better about sharing this on reddit rather than on the AVEN forums simply because I know there is a smaller group on reddit. I feel uncomfortable even sharing this where a lot of people will see it

I'm a trans woman(who has usually identified sexually as queer, and my hand ached constantly &gt;.&lt; ), after HRT my libido finally plummeted.   I went through a few periods of simply not masturbating or really being sexual, and seem to have reached an equilibrium of ""once every few days.""   I'll still find people attractive sexually, definitely, but not at all in the same lustful way I used to; there's a hollowness to it for me these days(unless it's my BF).

It seems to me that-while I thought about it a lot as a teenager- my desire to actually do the deed is way lower than most people's seem to be.   I didn't give a shit in high school, at all, and I could never understand why people made such a huge fuss over it.  It's always struck me more as a nice by-product of being in a relationship than anything else.

 What's really got me thinking about this, and my BF has numerous issues with sex and his body, so we don't really have sex much.  We've had sex of some sort(defining it as ""one of us has an orgasm"") plenty of times, but I can probably count the number of times that we've been completely naked together in a sexual way or touched each others genitals on both hands.   We've also had periods where we went without sex for weeks, maybe even a month.  And it honestly doesn't bother me in the slightest. Looking around the internet, and not just in the sex-crazy parts, that doesn't seem to be the norm.  I read about people leaving others because they don't 'fulfill them sexually. . .' I don't really get the idea of doing that, I DO enjoy sex when it happens, to be happy. 

So basically...yeah, I do masturbate, enjoy sex, and have sexual attraction(especially towards my partner) after all. But its not something I ever seek out, push for, or deem as 'important'.  Anyone mind explaining/expounding upon where the distinction lies between low-libido and demisexuality/grey-area asexuality?

I need to apologize in advance if I mix up any lingo or say anything offensive.  I myself am not an asexual (and I'm not entirely sure my gf is) and I don't know how to avoid all the potential pitfalls of wording.  

I'll organize my information into three categories because I feel that's the best way to give you a sense of where we are. Also


Romantic:

- She loves cuddling, and staring into each other's eyes.

- She tells me that she is in love with me (and that I'm the first guy she has felt this way about).

- She talks about getting married to me one day and being the mother to my children.


Sexual:

- She has no problems with me touching her anywhere I want.

- I perform oral sex on her which she tells me that she enjoys (but more on this later).

- She has told me that she masturbates. 


Non-sexual / Asexual

- She has only initiated kissing twice (both times were after I did something romantic). (Also

- She doesn't know if she has ever orgasmed.  When I perform oral sex for her it seems more like she is tensing up / breathing harder / fighting it than enjoying it or moaning. However, for instance I've felt her kegels contract involuntarily as well as muscles in her legs and pelvic region.  Still, when I ask she says she isn't sure that these are orgasms.  For me, as a man, orgasms are like a release - there is a definite point at which one occurs.  Of course this is not the situation for women so it's something I naturally have trouble understanding.  (I understand that this whole point may be better posed to a sex advice forum, but I feel that it is just one part of what I am trying to come to terms with).

- We haven't had sex yet.  She has told me that she is willing to have sex with me

- She has only had sex with one previous boyfriend and she tells me that she disliked it every time because of pain from penetration.

- When I am performing oral for her I do penetrate with my fingers (this is

- She has used the word ""asexual"" when talking about herself once - it was when she was telling me about her past experience with sex.

- She tells me that she never really feels ""horny"" and doesn't experience sexual attraction towards anyone



That's all I can think of for now

Here are my questions:

I think she is incredibly sexy and I would like to have sex with her.  She says that she is willing.  However I know her past experiences and I don't want her to do something which we both believe she will not enjoy.  How do I deal with this situation?  Is it fair of me to have sex with her? 

Is she an asexual? (I know there's probably no way to know this absolutely for sure

I'm looking forward to spending the rest of my life with this girl.  I love her more than I had ever imagined I could love anyone.  How do I cope with our differences in libido? If she truly doesn't enjoy sex but is willing to do it for me because she loves me

I know that sexuality is a changing thing and while I by no means want her to become something that she cannot be or change her if she doesn't want to change I also know that she would like to enjoy sex.  So are there any tips for what I can do to get her to enjoy it (mainly penetration)?

I was reading through and ended up on the AVEN site

I love relationships and I've pretty much been in one since puberty, that was fun because I like you and you had fun, or that was fun because I was spending intimate time with you, or, a lot of the time... that wasn't really fun but I know you like it and I want you to be happy. I can't tell if it's just me not knowing my body because I don't masturbate (and don't feel the need to ever, though my friends keep telling me to try it anyway), or if it's just me not really being into sex. It's about the same fun level as eating good food or watching a good TV show. 

I really want to be in relationships and cuddle and I don't mind having sex once I've spent a lot of time with the person and feel comfortable with them and they know my deal where I've never really had a great sexual experience and I don't really know my own body

Anyway, etc. after having been in sexual relationships. 

Also, and got quite jealous when he would make out with others in front of me, so I'm not sure if that's another layer or what. I feel bad because I do want to have exclusivity with my partner, but I also don't really know what's going on with myself sexually, and I don't want to limit them. I really do want a partner though, someone who I can care deeply for and who will care about me, and who I can spend a ton of time with.

Sex scenes in books bore the hell out of me or squick me out. I'm not even sure if my liking for certain actors *coughNealPatrickHarriscough* is attraction, or aesthetic appreciation. I find being kissed on the lips gross.

* Do asexual people ever masturbate? I mean

* I've looked through the subreddit and seen a few references to the fact that asexual people sometimes fall in love and have romantic relationships. I've also seen people address the fact that asexual people can fall in love with no sexual interest in another person. If that's so, but I always sort of thought of relationships that way.

* Kind of piggybacking off of the last question, would that couple ever have sex? I mean, I would assume the asexual person wouldn't particularly enjoy it, but would they make that sacrifice for their partner? And if not, would they let their partner have sex with other people? 

* Also piggybacking off of the last question, surely it wouldn't be very often. Wouldn't that bother the partner?

After about 6 months I calmed down enough. I'd started writing a story about the perfect relationship (a romantic one)

I thought maybe I needed some space. Try a little at a time. I played an MMO for a few months, I just felt disgusted with myself and disappeared.

As I posted in the title

* I rarely feel physical attraction (twice in my life?) and I don't recall ever feeling ""horny"" for a person or desiring to have sex with someone. I find many people ""attractive"" in an admiring
* I have learned to associate romantically wanting for ""hornieness"" because typically if I want to ""be with"" someone there is sex involved.
* I have never really had a desire to engage in sex. I have had sex because
* I masterbate but it's more about the physical release than a fantasy about being with someone. (It can be stress relieving or self-soothing) It can range between masterbating a handful of times in a month to not touching myself for 3+ months and not even realizing it)
* I am super curious about sex in all of its forms. I love human beings and am absolutely fascinated by sexuality in all its forms and why it's such a huge deal. For example, role-playing etc., but its because its so outside of my normal days experience and its just amazing what humans love, enjoy and what makes them feel fulfilled. But I don't want to actively participate in it. 
* Sex can physically feel good, blah, blah... but I could take it or leave it. Watch a movie? Eat a sandwich? Go for a walk? Have sex? I get way more excited about possibility of eating sandwich and going for a walk with my love.
* I understand that for many people sex is a very BIG part of their lives and its one major way some people feel loved and feel connected to their partner. I am open to engaging in sexual interactions for these reasons. I don't usually care if my partner and I ever have sex
* I have not yet had the gift of a polyamourus relationship, in a healthy way. (I have always been turned down and it has led to my partners hurt feelings, feelings of not feeling loved and such when I felt like I was just trying to be generous and open to having everyone have their needs fulfilled)
* I also feel a bit trapped and overwhelmed by the concept of long term monogamy and I believe I could be a better partner to an open, polyamorus/monogamish relationship.


*After all of those dynamics the reality is still that I want to find a life partner and I want to have biological children.*

Yes

So, no severe psychological/physical problems that would cause low or absent sex drive. I'm capable of achieving orgasm and do masturbate occasionally. I've found the frequency depends on the hormone levels that come with my menstrual cycle.

All throughout my youth I didn't partake in the usual crushing, though; one of my closets friends through high school was gay, and he taught me that I might not be into dating simply because I wasn't into boys.

But high school came and went and not only was I not into boys, but I'm perfectly capable of maintaining regular friendships. But I've never met someone and thought, *Gosh, that person is desirable. I want to have a relationship and/or have sex with them.*

I took a gap year before college (I was very young for my grade and wanted to catch up/earn some money for college), and I said yes.

He was a perfectly nice guy and we had a good enough time. We had Italian and saw *Beowulf*. I enjoyed myself, I couldn't manage to reciprocate. He asked me out a few more times, which I declined.

Skip forward a few years. I'm online and I meet a very nice guy called Tom. We get along marvelously, and one day we end up talking about our romantic lives. I tell him about Steve (since that's all there is to tell, really), and he tells me about some of his past girlfriends and sex life. Eventually he expresses interest in meeting, and perhaps establishing a romantic tryst.

Around this time I had heard about asexuality and was very nervous about how it almost perfectly described me. I thought that I couldn't be sure until I at least tried to start something resembling a relationship, invites me to sleep in his bed (""Nothing hinky,"" he swears). And even though I'm flattered at the proposition, it just isn't in me to say yes. He may be into me but I just wasn't into him.

So now here I am.

I'm perfectly capable of finding members of both sexes attractive objectively (I'm an avid member of r/ladyboners)

But despite that

Maybe I just want to write this for the catharsis. But a real part of me wants to hear the opinions of people who've, but I still don't know what to think.
