1328821664.0,pibat,Your Personal Cupid,Cutepid,521,64,90,"**SUPER ULTRA MEGA IMPORTANT EDIT** - Since so many people have expressed interest in helping out

So you're lonely. You've tried it all: eharmony, chemistry... Everything. Forever, it just seems like there is no one out there for you. Then you hear about r4r. You figure, ""Eh, what the heck."" And give it a shot. You're pretty numb to the fact that, yet again, you have been let down. Is there seriously no help for you? Are you doomed to be forever alone? Fret not my friends

**Who am I:** I am a gender neutral entity that exists to help you find someone on reddit who will break your cycle of forever alone.

**How:** Message me and tell me a bit about yourself (criteria will be listed later) and a little about who you would like to meet. You can be as descriptive or geberal as you please

**Why trust you:** Firstly, because you have nothing left to lose and everything to gain.

**How long will this take:** I can't say for sure. Days, so I will do my best.

**What compensation do you require:** None. Just pay it forward I suppose. There are lots of lonely people out there who need a hand or deserve a chance at love. If you can

**What Cutepid Needs From You to Get Started:**

*You:*

Gender

Age

Location (Relative is fine)

Height/Weight/Ethnicity (because

Hobbies/Interests

*Them*

Whatever requisites that you feel necessary to form a connection

Again, if you wish, I can disclose your information to each other or I can merely exchange your user names and you guys can go from there. I know the mystery can be a bit exciting at times ;) Anyway, do your worst and I'll do my best!


P.S. I wrote this on my phone and I know there are some errors

Edit 1: Great googly moogly this is getting a lot more attention than I expected! This is a good thing  though! I'm looking forward to working with you all to make love! Err... To make love last! Anyway, but think if it this way: the more popular this gets the better your chances! Don't get discouraged if nothing happens today, I'm still wading through messages and I WILL get to you and I will try my darndest to find someone for you!

Edit 2: Ok, though, the game is on!

Edit 3: I'm back at it. There are so many responses! Firstly

Edit 4: TWO months of gold?! Wow guys, you'll need it for the date I'll hopefully be setting you up on ;) On a serious note, keep the responses coming, but note that, while a few matches happened tonight, most of them won't be sent out until later tonight my time or tomortow morning as I am still organizing all the information you wonderful people have sent. Don't feel discouraged if you don't get a message by then, remember that I said this might take time. Thank you so much for your patience!

Edit 5: Good news and bad news. The good news, for you guys, is there are lots and lots and lots of guys! I should be sending out a wave of matches in the coming hours (I finally managed to shift through most of the messages), but let me stress that this is ONLY the beginning, and if you do NOT receive a message soon I have not forgotten about you! Love takes time!

Edit 6: Phew, don't ever think it's too late. That being said, I'm going to take my break for the evening and I will resume my duties in the morning!

Edit 7 (8:50 A.M. PST): Some more matches have gone out. Unfortunately I have an 8 hour shift ahead of me and no access to data I compiled last night. Expect some delay between now and the next batch of match,False,,t5_2rn0e,True,,,t3_pibat

I am no longer taking applications for this stage of Personal Cupid! Please keep your eyes open for the update thread!

After the success of the previous cupid ideas

**Intro**

I am a happily married man so I have no personal vested interest in meeting someone

**Why personal cupid?**

You've tried it all: OkCupid, and you can't trust a computer to crunch numbers and find you a match, or your ads just didn't catch the right eye.

**How do I join?**

Simple! Send me a PM with following the guidelines below

**Required Info**

*You:*

Age, current occupation, stats (height / weight / ethnicity), hobbies and five words to describe yourself. Also include your preference of relationship, skype buddy, fwb, etc!

*Them:*

What are you looking for? Age range, stats, their ideal evening / Sunday, interests.. write a brief description of your preferred match!

**Guidelines**

Note that if you do not send a picture (not required) you will not be paired with someone who did send a picture. Fair is fair. When you are matched with someone I will send the picture along with their details

Have an open mind! 

If you use a throwaway - CHECK YOUR INBOXES REGULARLY. I do not want to match someone after 4 days only for them never to log in to their account again.

Have fun :)

----

Sidenote: There have been 3 personal cupid events that I know of, I'm just trying to make it a little bit more awesome!

EDIT: When sending a picture you should know that it is sometimes possible to find someones Facebook profile thru the URL. I would advise uploading your images to a different host (such as imgur) in future. Your privacy is safe with me but you never know who might be out there. *x-files music*

The vacation is planned for the first week of September.  If you are interested

About me: I'm a 27 year old guy.  5 foot 10 200 lbs.  I like sci-fi and fantasy shows, Game of Thrones, Supernatural, Doctor Who, and It's always Sunny.  I enjoy taking pictures, and consider myself an amateur photographer.  Though, I'll be the first to admit my photos are not perfect.

Activities I would like us to do:  I would enjoy going for walks around the lake

You: a female between the ages of 21 and 33. Be in decent shape, but I would like to cuddle.  There are several bedrooms, so sleeping together is also not expected.

Message me and tell me about yourself.

So, I couldn't log on this account so I used a different one, and because of that, whenever I made an R4R, it got deleted.. people thought I was a liar, though I'm not sure why someone would lie about being in a wheelchair. I verified myself to a mod a month or so ago. I've been homeschooled since 7th grade, I'm a junior in Hs. I left school because I wanted to study more, not a class


I started getting into video games upon joining Homeschool, yet. I'm not afraid to admit it!


I have a really dark sense of humor. I've been published twice for poetry, I'm not saying I'm looking for a relationship in this, but if we like each other, then that's cool, I've had a long distance relationship before, it was somewhat serious and we did plan on meeting, but it didn't work out.


I'm a shy person when you first meet me. I'm different around other people. I'm great at reading people. Chameleon soul? Once you get to know me, making people laugh, being myself, I love the rain and snow, I used to live 40 mins from Seattle before I moved to cali - don't get me wrong, beaches are great!





I have SMA 2, and can do my makeup, hair, type, write in my journal, eat, etc... yes



If you PM me





I'm just looking for someone...I'm not sure how to word it...I think you get it? :)

You can connect via chat clients if you frequent irc a lot

- [mibbit webchat client](http://www.mibbit.com/) (irc webclient for -any irc-network)

- [mIRC](http://www.mirc.com/) (Installable desktop chat client)


You do not need to create an account or anything. You just drop into the chatroom with a certain topic and start chatting right away. Double clicking on somebodies name starts a private chat. 


There are a lot of chat rooms for subreddits on freenode.net
namely: #reddit-subredditname


Only downside (for some of you if you care about this) is that it is possible for others to see your ip address. This is how ever a non issue if you ask me. Seeing as it is also possible to see the ip address of the other user if you chat with skype or msn. Though that requires slightly more effort. If you're very concious about your anonymity you should stick to private messages over reddit. There are extra ways of hiding your anonymity but that'd be a more technical in-dept discussion which is not the point of this topic.

- I am Filfy_Milfy a 46 year old  lady with some rather lovely tits (see my previous post), emotionally fulfilled and yes my husband will know about you, in fact he will help me make my selection. I will provide verification to you in a PM. We are indeed aware of the  issues that could arise from a meeting such as this, therefore your safety, security, and discretion, as well as mine, that is up to you as it will not sway my choice one or another. Please include any  inquires you have in the PM. 

If you do not meet the following criteria

-STD free (condoms mandatory and will be provided)
- 18/19 male or T
- open to any race or sexual preference. If you are gay
- inexperienced
- You must be emotionally stable and sexually uninhibited (no hang ups).
-Completely understand and accept the arrangement as described here and in PMs.
-Premature finishing is not a problem...just reload. I expect you to be a little nervous and there are no expectations for you to be a porn star...I'm not one! 
- If you consider yourself unattractive, nerdy or anything else along this line, please PM me. 
- You  will be respectful, well groomed and have a tidy appearance. (if you love your TapOut t-shirt we weren't meant to meet).
-A nonjudgmental and relaxed atmosphere is guaranteed. 


Any questions you have will be answered and more details will be provided in our PM conversation.

I will answer all PMs...as quickly as I can.

*When replying to a post…*


**READ!** Show that you read the post, you’ll know exactly what their intentions are by reading – if she’s just looking for a hookup, an online friend, a cuddle buddy. The OP’s intentions pretty much dictate your reply, if you don’t respect or reflect them… then you shouldn’t be responding. Beneficial for everyone.


**Please,” but it’s something everyone notices and subconsciously judges/makes note of.


**Don’t open with an insult or skepticism.** The whole “there are no girls on the internet” dogma is generally unwitty in these situations. Also


**Before you start to type “I know you’re probably getting swamped with…” STOP.** As they always say, made up, but totally plausible statistics… I know.)


**If she says she’s just looking for someone to chat with online, and most often an omission has nothing to do with privacy. 


**If she says she’s just looking for someone to chat with online, you could be talking to an uggo… but if the intentions are a platonic relationship, when why does it matter? Hot girls and uggos alike will probably be offended that you only care about physical appearances, especially when attraction is so irrelevant when exchanging a few IMs/PMs or becoming internet friends. 


**Remember, cool. Instead of saying something along the lines of “OMG you liked Mega Man 2? You are my dream girl,” ask her what her favorite games are. If you wouldn’t say it to a guy, don’t say it to a girl.


**Separate your GW and r4r alt accounts.** If you use 1 account for daily redditing and everything else, nothing wrong whatsoever, but we hope you’re also reading the other great content on reddit. What you comment on shows what’s important to you – it’s not like we are doing a background check, but seeing a bunch of NSFW tags on a user overview is pretty obvious visually.


*When you don’t get a response…*


I know it's common courtesy to shoot a quick message even if saying you're not interested


Don’t be offended if you get a few responses and then never receive a reply back – chances are your message got lost in the mess that is reddit’s PM system, then she’s definitely intrigued by you. If you haven’t heard back from her in a reasonable amount of time (give her a day or two), PM her again. It’s assertive and she’ll see that you’re interested in her enough to pursue her.


**tl;dr – Read posts and act appropriately. Don’t be offended by rejection.**

No, but at first I would like to try facilitating matches within each persons respective living zones, so as to increase the possibility of making this last. Cupids will also, hopefully, provide the people they match with some insight. You know, places to go for a date and other general advice (another important reason to pick Cupids that have knowledge of the area they govern).

* Authenticates to Reddit for ""Certified Redditor"" status.
* Has some basic profile features with pictures. Includes a link to your personal Reddit thread if you have one.
* Matches users based on mutual activity interests
* Uses geolocation info to find the Redditors within X distance you specify.
* Framework currently matches on gay/straight/bisexual male/female
* Heavy on privacy settings. Share as much or as little as you like.
* Twitter bootstrap based

So here's my deal, I know this is very probably true.


So I've decided something has to change. Unfortunately, rather forcefully.


So here's where I’m hoping one of you fine people come in. I'm looking for a penpal... kind of. Well


The challenge I propose is as follows. We'd set up a joint youtube channel and for the next year we post videos to each other. The only rule is that you can't record any videos from inside your house. The idea being, we don’t even have to be doing anything fun, just as long as we're NOT in our house!


The content of the video doesn't really matter


Why video? Well because... I'm a liar. If this was an ordinary penpal scenario, even if it's just to walk down my road while I tell you about my uneventful day. I've heard good things about fresh air.


So yeah, this could be the start of a beautiful friendship! Either that, or it'll be the most awkward social experiment you've ever taken part in. Who knows!


If you’ve read this far and are at all interested


Cheers!

Often I see things likes ""[m4f]Looking for someone to hang out with in [insert location]"" and then a trickle of text like ""I'm down for whatever. I'm easy going

There isn't a lot of information to work with here. The less you share

Instead of trying to appear as casual as possible, but how about some interests, or some disinterests? How about some funny anecdotes? Don't pressure yourself into trying to think of some ""really awesome things"" but try to share more, try to share yourself as a person so that the readers can understand who you are and what you want to do for fun.

For Example:
Do you like drawing? Post a picture you did recently.
Do you like music? Link to some bands you like
Do you like video games? Find a Katamari Partner

And finally, and share more. It can only help you find good people.

---

Of course this is all null and void if you're just looking for a fuck buddy or a hook up, guy or girl, enjoy being played. If you want to find a friend or a relationship then its acceptable to start with ""just want to hang out"" but if you're just looking for somebody sexual, then openly state so, there are plenty of people looking for you as well. ;)

I wanted to share our success story because I wanted to give those of you looking for something serious a dose of reality. The ratio of men to women here is a little staggering

Our story seems a little odd because everything went so fast (nobody's pregnant- promise). I posted last May and got a bunch of replies. He wasn't even the most promising of the guys I talked to! But he was smart and well read, and it was all about him. We met in August and said we would wait to see each other again at Thanksgiving. We didn't make it that long and met again in September, and October, and my family for Thanksgiving, his family for Christmas. We got engaged on New Year's Eve, then six months later, we had a destination wedding

Here's what I learned and my advice for anyone who might want it:

Ladies, but it's worth it if something matters to you. Don't be scared off by assholes. Just be honest. I would suggest replying to everyone. I know the expectation is ""omg dick picks for dayyyyys,"" but that wasn't my experience. I didn't share pictures right away, and my post was pretty clear that I wanted someone who was special. Lots of responses, but very few were looking for some DTF girl. Like I said, my guy wasn't the most promising, but once I started talking to him

Gentlemen, is to go for the details. With the ladies, I think that those of us who are searching for something real are looking for someone that we can connect to, someone that makes us feel like we would always have something to talk about, like you and I have something in common that matters. Make sure you share that in your posts and messages! It's so hard to pay any attention to someone who doesn't even try to give you something to discuss. I know that you think the odds aren't in your favor and it's not worth it to spend all that time on one response, but maybe it is. Maybe you're wrong. Try!

Good luck

I think I'd enjoy hanging out with someone who knows that I'm a virgin from the start. It would be great if she could be a bit aggressive and help me out of my shell.

Hi

I just wanted to give you all a little reminder on some of the rules of /r/r4r. They are always listed on the sidebar if you need to check them out!

&gt;1.  Absolutely no phone numbers, or personal information in the body or comments of your post!
&gt;2.  No posts in exchange for money
&gt;3.  /r/r4r is an 18+ subreddit.
&gt;4.  Be civil. Don't be an asshole. No sexist generalizations. No racist and homophobic remarks/slurs. No ad hominems. No spamming the subreddit with the same comments over and over again.
&gt;5.  Moderators have a right to ban based upon these rules. If you have an issue with someone on the subreddit

As of right now

**PLEASE DO NOT POST YOUR KIK USERNAME/SCREEN NAME/EMAIL/PHONE NUMBER/ANY USERNAME FOR ANY SITE WITHIN THE BODY OR COMMENTS OF POSTS**

We ask you to not do this because the moderators cannot make sure that every username is actually from the person who wrote the post/comment. There are people out there who will do malicious things. It is best if you PM someone your username to keep in contact with them instead of putting it out on a public website. 

Thanks so much!

Well, and seemed intelligent and friendly. I eventually added him on gchat under my real name, and we talked fairly frequently over the next few months - we discussed literature (a lot - he's a writer), politics, his shitty job and my language course, talked about plans for the future and argued fiercely about music.

Early on in the new year a classmate told me that she had been wanting to visit my new friend's home city for some time

I don't think I'm misremembering when I say that looking at his face for the first time, that never happened again.

I met up with him 4 times during that week. On the second occasion

I can't really explain it, and when I'd say anything arrogant or condescending (it's one of my bigger character flaws) he'd laugh and like me *more* for it. Under a grouchy and misanthropic exterior, he was a kind person who liked taking care of others. And he loved me.

I went back to Syria

But by then I already knew I'd be starting a new job in September of that year, and then in August. I was determined to make it work.

A lot more happened before I finally realized this, as ever: my career destroys relationships; he was struggling with the combination of depression and being broke, and too proud to let me help with either.

He turned 28 a few days ago. I will be 26 next month. We haven't spoken in a few months

Thank you for taking part in this short social experiment. As per general ethical guidelines in regards to research and deception used in that research
   
   
The nature of the situation put forth to the public (career woman in late 20's, as the nature of the website and the internet allows for anonymous responses, which, ideally, will lead to more truthful opinions. Initial responders were replied to by either myself or my friend helping me with the study in hopes of adding legitimacy to the offer, but we were quickly overwhelmed by the number of responses and chose instead to remain silent.


Note that if you responded, photos, personal information, social networking accounts (ie Facebook, okcupid, etc) has been saved nor will be used in the purpose of this study. Your participation has remained completely anonymous.


The data breaks down as follows:


**Private Messages**
These are messages that were sent directly to the presumed poster. Positive messages were either those looking to pursue the offer presented, or those claiming illegality of the offer. Neutral messages were those asking for clarification, asking general questions to understand the situation better, or simply expressing doubt towards the scenario. PMs that included demographic information about the person (age, location, body type, etc) were counted as Legitimate Offers. PMs that included either links to a photo


**Total # of PM's** (counts only each unique pm'er): **113**

* Positive: **99**

* Negative: **7**

* Neutral: **7**

* Legitimate Offers: **87**

* Messages w/ Photos: **34**

* Skeptical: **4**

1371444560.0,1ghw7a,[meta] Do you have trouble connecting to people? Getting the internet cold shoulder far too often? Welcome to relationships 101,djeinstine,81,14,16,"I have spoken to many people on r4r here looking for friends to talk to

Most of us have have been on the receiving end of the cold shoulder or are guilty of  it - I am no exception. There are a variety of reasons why someone will just stop talking to you out of the blue. The internet

Here in this little discussion I want to focus on what I feel to be the main reason why someone gives the cold shoulder. Before I go on

_____________________________________________

Lets begin:

**You haven't done your part**

Yes, if not all, of the conversation. After the initial greetings, it feels so difficult to maintain fluidity of the conversation. I am not saying I am some expert conversationalist but there are certain key things in a person's response that will help me converse with them. Lets look at these examples:

**Example 1**
&gt;**Person1:** Hey how is life going over there in &lt;Xlocation&gt;? Are you working or going to university?

&gt;**Person2:** Not bad. I'm working part time at a library.

**Example 2**
&gt;**Person1:** Hey how is life going over there in &lt;Xlocation&gt;? Are you working or going to university?

&gt;**Person2:** Life is pretty good! I can't complain really. I'm working part time at a library but it's only to help me get on my feet to reach my bigger goal of eventually owning my own bookstore. I really love reading and books in general! How about you? What do you do?

In Example 1, but they also elucidated a few facts about themselves which can be used as talking points for Person 1. Also they asked Person 1 about their life **showing interest.** 

Showing interest in someone can make a big difference in the flow of the conversation. Even if you aren't completely interested in them, look at previous posts or even change the topic altogether if you're that stuck.

I emphasize this point a lot because unfortunately, I feel like you don't even care about the conversation and are just shooting back responses like blank bullets. This is a fast way to make the conversation a one way street or get a cold shoulder.


This brings me to another point, or even didn't understand them but that shouldn't stop them from giving at least two sentences on each one.

Remember the goal here is to find common ground that both of you can reach. Sometimes common ground is right there

----------------

You remember [this thing](http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/1jai76/meta_r4r_cupid_results_and_ama/)

It looks like a lot of people didn't get paired, it's even harder to get a decent connection.

WELL, and if you thought that maybe your requirements were too strict the first time around, consider loosening them up a bit.

Here are some things you should consider posting.  Since privacy is important and this is no place for controversy

* what kind of connection you're looking for (M4W, etc // skype buddies, gaming buddies, casual dating, long-term potential, fwb, etc etc)

* your location

* how far you're willing to travel

* your age

* age range preferences

* physical characteristics you're looking for

* your physical characteristics

* your hobbies and interests

* some of your favorite movies, sports, outdoor actives, magazines, etc etc

* life philosophy/belief system

If you're looking for dates

Consider saving this post and returning to it periodically over the next few days.  What you're looking for may not appear right away.

I think we're all adults here guys. We all are interested in the opposite sex. It's not ""bad."" It's not ""wrong"" If it's consensual than its all kosher. I think this is holding r4r back. It seems people aren't comfortable with their needs. Just be clear and communicate.  Also, socially awkward guy archetype. 

Most people on r4r are normal cool people. I can tell you this from my own experiences. I have met MANY cool interesting people from here. The ladies are nice, upvote and celeberate and have fun together!

**Edit 2** - Tons of messages and I replied to most of them. Some feedback I have (and I am not trying to be snarky - just honestly give feedback). The people who sent me pics got pics back right away. If you asked me for something like cam sex (which I am not in to) I appreciated the direct request and let you know if I was in to it or not. People who wrote nice notes describing themselves got more info about me and maybe a pic. If you just wrote ""send me pics"" or ""I'm interested"" it wasn't much to go on for me to figure out if **I** was interested so the exchange basically stopped right there.

Just to place a caveat - I have messaged the mods and they have agreed (with lovely enthusiasm) that this can be posted on here.

I'm intending to create a dating website that only focuses on people's flaws. There are a lot of dating websites out there that tend to follow a very strict format: Make yourself seem as great as possible and hopefully someone will dig it.

Sometimes it works - often, I think this site will nurture a more honest, authentic and ultimately successful dating environment. 

A standard profile will include a short bio, so rather then pretending that we are, we should embrace it and look for people that like us in spite of our flaws. Perhaps even **because** of our flaws.

I basically just wanted to ask how you guys would feel about this. Is it something you could see yourself signing up for? Would you trust this kind of format more? Personally, who can acknowledge their own flaws whilst seeing the beauty in other people's.

I'm a really particular person. I like to think that I'm a complicated and unique individual with positive characteristics. I have some strong interests, religion, but I guess what I'm trying to communicate is that I enjoy all kinds of conversation and sharing of ideas. I'm a big fan of TED talks especially and I enjoy all different kinds of arts.

In the past, I realize that there are all kinds of caring and genuine people out there that I would do well connecting with and I've come to the conclusion that those positive human connections are the spice of life. I want to keep growing as a person and sharing my thoughts and feelings with my fellow human beings, appreciating this experience of life together.

Just for some background,000.

My kidneys failed 2 weeks ago and since then my life has been a blur of life changing events. Without having any time to emotionally process my experience, with an implant for Peritoneal Dialysis sticking out of my abdomen.

As if this wasn't enough, the next day after leaving the hospital, the Lupus flared worst than it ever has before and attacked my entire body, including my brain, causing me 6 grand mal seizures. I ended up in the ICU for days, almost dying, had I not been saved by massive doses of steroids. This happened last Sunday. I experienced short term memory loss and had to rebuild my sense of self and strength over the next couple of days.

I've been in the hospital the entire time. I'm posting this from the wifi there right now. Hopefully

So, I don't necessarily click with most people. I decided to put my long winded story of what's been happening in my life lately because I figured that would be the best way to communicate the kind of wavelength I'm looking for in other people. I figure, I can reveal myself and my nature, and you, the reader, should be able to determine if you can relate to me and leave a comment if you think we might have a meaningful connection and maybe, just maybe

I'm stating a very simple fact.

If you perform an action and do need receive the desired results

1: Get better at performing the action such that the results improve  
2: Do not expect such great results

You'll notice that there is no ""3: Complain"". Life isn't fair

Hypothetical time: Let's say that 50% of F4M posts end in a 'match' and that the average F4M post gets 10 responses indicating interest. The numbers are more or less irrelevant as long as you operate under the fairly evident assumption that girls get lots and lots of messages. That means that for every 20 messages sent from males to females, New Jersey) there can be days and weeks in between posts from local girls, and then you have to cross your fingers and pray that the stars align such that you both have chemistry AND you messaged early enough/stood out enough from the other replies that she chose to pursue a more meaningful connection with you over the other dozen suitors filling up her inbox.

I'm not implying that there's anything wrong with you. Far from it. I'm saying that when it comes to online dating the deck is rigged against you and I, witty, educated, loaded guys (of which I'm sure there are several) can have trouble finding girls in a place like r4r because the odds are perpetually in the lady's favor.

How many local F4M posts do you see on a daily basis? 1 if you're lucky

I could also go into detail as to why the odds are stacked against the average male (because the exceptionally attractive 'outliers' are likely to be recycled back into the dating pool over time) or attempt to explain why not making a match is not necessarily a bad thing (it means that when you DO make a match that you were the most attractive of the potential suitors to the lady in question and that leads to strong chemistry and a greater likelihood of longer-term success) but I doubt any significant number of people will read and/or understand what I'm trying to get at. I understand that this post is probably fairly abstract and I'm prone to rambling and using big words but hopefully it's at least a little helpful in conveying the basic message.

**tl;dr the odds of finding a match on r4r are drastically weighted against the M4F demographic. The 2 main factors that you can change to increase your chances are 'quantity of messages sent' (relative to the number of local F4M posts) and 'quality of messages sent' (determined by the rate of reply; includes things such as your attractiveness), you reduce the amount of time spent per message sent which means that if the time you can spend on r4r per day is less than the time it would take to scroll down the list of every single new post + the time spent sending messages, it's increasing the total number of messages you can send and therefore improving your chances at receiving a fitting response.**

***tl;dr the tl;dr I am a verbose motherfucker. Life isn't fair. Girls can be picky when they have their choice of the litter. Nothing you can do will change the nature of women or the population demographics of r4r, because you can't always get what you want.***

I got a lot of interest in the thread and via PM (you wouldn't believe...) about the results of the R4R cupid matching I volunteered to do last week.  I thought I would make a quick results thread and then answer any additional questions y'all had about the process, but will give my best estimates. I am still working on a few more matches

All the links are music I have included to help you get through the copious reading.
_______________________________________________________
I wanted to start by telling you about [my process.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLf2CO5V2mA)  It was not [glamorous](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RuxkqOg_jQ) or [scientific](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMWGXt979yg) by any means.  I fielded your PM, and Foreign) and then separated again by gender for a total of 6 tabs that I could compare [side-by-side](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjNX_gayY1E). I would guess this took me about 30 hours total, but I was drinking for most of the data entry process on Wednesday and Thursday night, so I made it through somehow.

After my entries were set [in stone](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbPxUxNtVR8), I highlighted you blue (Geographic mismatch) and had to ignore you for the rest of the process.  There were SO MANY redditors who were awesome people that simply didn't have anyone near them submit an entry.  I had to ignore a few [Ryan Reynolds look-alikes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5aZJBLAu1E), and [girls](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIb6AZdTr-A) that (were I a less moral man) I would have asked to move in with me on the spot.  The important thing to remember here is that no matter how eligible you may be, Reddit is worldwide and redditors are still [few and far between](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=338eKCOSEVQ). Especially those on /r/r4r.

After I sent out all the IRL pairs, or just someone to talk to.  I had a lot of these requests, so again, I went line-by-line and did my best to pair those folks up.  Sadly, a lot of them didn't include a picture, and then requested that their match be as cute as they were.  I didn't feel good about matching a very eligible bachelorette who had reasonable expectations along with a gentleman who had no supporting documentation, even if they sounded like they may get along.  I reserved matching on these folks for couples whose descriptions were truly a fantastic match.  Just because both of you enjoy video games may be enough to strike up a conversation at a bar, I think I did a pretty good job pairing everyone who was largely compatible. 

As a final takeaway, check one out sometime.  Humans are so goddamn fascinating.) Trying to pair two strangers with naught but a username, location, and maybe 100 words about what they think they want made me very nervous!  At the very least, if I got a few people together for [a nice date](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoUV5d09JZw), I'll be very pleased.  I'll be deleting my spreadsheet at the end of next week after I tie a few loose end couples together, so if you want your personal info back, usernames

* I am fat. I'm also curvy, don't insist on wearing a shirt or turning off the lights when I have sex or anything like that, but if you want someone lean and mean, I'm not for you and likely never will be.
* I smoke. Both cigarettes and... other things, but I like to undertake Major Self Projects one at a time and I'm kind of tied up with the diet-and-exercise thing at the moment.
* I have kids, so it would be a while before my kids would affect you except peripherally, as regards my availability when they're home. But some people hate kids, and if you're one of those people, I am not the droid you're looking for.

Now

* I'm pretty smart
* I'm funny. And my sense of humor is broad enough that unless you are completely humor-free
* I'm nice. I try to be a kind
* I give fantastic email and, so I don't think I'm too shabby in person, either.
* I have some nerd cred. While I can't play a FPS to save my life, comics, and computery stuff, and I speak pretty fluent meme (though not to a cringeworthy degree).
* I'm pretty. Yeah, but I'm an *attractive* fatty.
* I'm not crazy. I'm not on any prescribed medications
* I'm stable. Not as in ""not crazy, my life is in pretty good shape and I don't have any major issues looming over me.

In no particular order

Cherry pie, The Princess Bride, Buddhism, botanical gardens, spring, water with lemon, sweet red wine, animals (though some more than others), lavender, Firefly

Here are some things I dislike

Cilantro, callous people and general assholes, chicken, people who don't own their issues, folding and putting away laundry, poor grammar and usage, Transitions lenses glasses.

Here is what I'm looking for:

* Someone local. I cannot be emphatic enough about this. I am *not* looking for a pen pal
* Someone 35-50. **Also not negotiable.** I'm totally a MILF
* Someone honest, passive-aggressive Nice Guy (TM), but someone who values forthrightness and directness without being a gratuitous asshole.
* Someone smart. I don't care about your schooling
* Someone progressive and not overly tied to religion of any sort. I'm not a traditionalist nor a conservative
* Someone funny. Or, at least be willing to laugh at my jokes. But try to be funny. I, like everyone else in the dating world, love to laugh. Snark and deadpan are welcome qualities.
* Someone confident. I don't so much dig arrogant assholes
* I don't really know that I'm looking for a boyfriend, or one-time hookup.** The ""F"" in FWB is nearly as important to me as the ""B"" part, though who doesn't like a good fuck? Still, we should be able to hang out and do not-naked things together without it being awkward or weird.
* I'm kind of into big, sensitive hippie attitude. By no means am I super-exacting about superficial things like weight and clothes and height and stuff like that, but I do like the big bear-like fellas, to a point.
* Some degree of kink, but I'm not plain vanilla, either.

So to cut a long story short, go for a run, come home and then spend hours on the internet. Nowadays I don't even go to class anymore because I can't be bothered with going to a place where half the people wouldn't notice my absence in the first place. I just feel like a ghost, constantly flitting in and out of campus, trying to get over the ""ordeal"" of a one hour lecture as best as I can. 

Well, and I like most people on my course but because I'm too shy to talk to anyone because the conversation will inevitably trail off into schoolwork because, after all, I wasn't there on Saturday when so-and-so got white girl wasted and peed on the houseplant in dorms. The worst thing is that I've never been this lonely. I was pretty confident and well-liked in the past. I'm not even disliked or particularly unhappy right now, really, just completely and utterly unnoticed which gets to me a little. I feel like I have completely forgotten how to make friends!


Everyone sees me as the timid

I finish the school year after Easter so there's no point trying to salvage anything (right now) but that means I'm left with the prospect of little social interaction from now until September 28th. My only respites being the library

So

I like to read. A lot. Due to all my free time lately, I also like to write at length. Sometimes it's about my life or what I've eaten or what I plan to eat the next day. Other times it's stories that I've written at the back of class. Most of the time it's just endless drawings of wonky cuboids, though. Dancing is one of my favorite things (*is favoritest a word?*) and I'm part of a pretty cool dance society at college. It's one of the few places where I stop being Ghost Girl and act like my real self. I think that's it, eh. I don't have any other hobbies. I'd like to say that I'm adventurous and that I go for long walks in the countryside but it's fucking cold and I try to avoid practical clothes. I'm always open to trying new things, though. New books, new games, new movies

I have really gained a lot of insight from this experience that I would like to share with you.
[I made an excel document to show what the responses were made up of.](http://imgur.com/ACCgi)
*A genuine response can be defined as someone looking to date or begin talking with someone as a potential love interest.*


**Insights to be gained from this information.**

* If you want to be taken seriously don't have a sex or alcohol related username.

* Don't message someone just to chat when they are not interested.

* Follow common courtesy and etiquette. Be straightforward. If you are interested in someone let them know


**Advice for Men**

* Be confident. Start subscribing to Seddit or AskSeddit. They really are great resources for believing in yourself.

* Based on my statistics- most of the people that respond to a woman's post are just looking to chat or will flake out almost immediately. If you've exchanged numbers or any other type of information you are GOLDEN. GO GO GO and believe in yourself!

* Respond to more Women's posts and if she is taking you seriously make a lot of moves and be consistent.

* Don't be concerned with all the other men responding to her post. If she is talking to you

* What I couldn't get over the most was how many men I gave my number to or added on facebook didn't follow up or after seeing a picture was like ""no

* Wait to send a pic. I am vain

**Advice for Women**

* Submit your own personal. I responded to two personals before I posted mine. Honestly

* Respond to all genuine messages. Don't leave anyone hanging. It's better to be upfront than not say anything at all.

* Know what you want and be direct about it.

* I had a process for my r4r responses that I really liked. After receiving a message from someone I would ask them 3 questions. At least one of them being ""What do you look for in the opposite sex?"" the others were related to the information they sent me. This allowed me to kind of weed out people I wouldn't be interested in.

I'm not really sure what to say other than I'm looking for people around my area to hang out/do activities with. I have quite a few friends

I'm a recent widower and losing my wife has left me feeling a bit lost. I want to make it clear that I'm not looking for a relationship; just a platonic friendship at this point. 

I'm an aspiring writer who enjoys books, deep conversation, good beer, Scotch, offensive humor and simplicity. I'm also an introvert who values quite a bit of time alone.  I seem to click well with ENFPs (if you're into Meyers-Briggs, we'll get along well.) 

I wouldn't mind hanging with someone who enjoys being read to, Cormac McCarthy, John Green, Kerouac, and Pahlaniuk are my homeboys.

Nope

Fuck-up 22 y/o bi female in the suburbs of Chicago seeks other fuck-ups to drink, drink, break stuff, go to concerts, write, sing, play video games, career-minded individuals need not apply. 

Having said that it may shock you to know I'd be lying if I said I was a positive person... and look, and most of you (us) are weirdos; there's gotta be a few of you around that sustain yourselves on contempt for the world. Tragically, I say all this and I'm not even hot, more like that cute chubby girl that's not your first choice, but she's but good in bed and kinky as shit. Something like that.

I hate myself desperately

Like most of you, ""Meet me at X bar, I'll be the one drinking Jack and Diet Coke, and if I've had enough you can touch my boobies,"" I'd rather correspond first before we get to that level. Consquently, if you harbor a bitter resentment towars other people or the world at large, if you want a front-row seat to watch someone crash, if you're not reading anything else I'm writing because you're still thinking about the word ""boobies"" (it's okay

I'm a writer. I know there's some errant commas running amok but if I gave a fuck I'd have no fucks to give about something more important. Like [KONY 2012](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1FKS1SHSsc).",,t5_2rn0e,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/updsw/22_f4mf4f_obnoxious_platitude/

I'm a 24-year-old inner-city math/science teacher with a big heart. I'm a 5'6"" brunette with nice curves. I'm a published scientist who graduated from college with a 3.96 GPA

I love: The Walking Dead, tea, energy drinks, wedge salads, steak, Netflix, roller coasters, biking

I drink socially (a few times a month with my fellow teachers). I smoke hookah and weed (but don't smoke cigarettes).

As a romantic partner, willingly, passionately, and often (albeit, not on the first few dates). I love spending time together, but I understand that everyone needs their own hobbies, friends

More about what I'm looking for: I would like to find a man in the Detroit area with a kind and caring personality, a job, or an internship. I value intelligence and strength of character.

At this point, see a movie, grab a drink, or get dinner. I'm not looking for a friends with benefits/casual/NSA situation. I'm looking for something with substance!

1353049054.0,13ae77,18 [F4R] - I have a strange request. (A non-sexual one.),thismayseemstrange,58,21,49,"Perverts

I am looking for a positive parental figure/role model. I would prefer mature

I want someone in my life who I can talk to, about problems. I want someone who will able to help me understand things that I'm clueless in life about. I want someone who will at least show some interest in what I do. I want someone I can just have great conversations with, laugh with, and just have fun with. I want someone I can cry to when life has gotten to be too much. I don't want to be coddled though, I'd prefer if you laid out the cold truth. I need to be taught right from wrong. I need someone who cares for me. Someone who can do a damn good job at being there unlike my parents. 

I was raised in a very negative environment. I have noticed that I am starting to exhibit some negative behaviors like, social withdrawal, unable to hold a job, little to no interest in school and low academic performance. 

I am currently on the waiting list to see a therapist

I want to change my upside down life and make it better. I don't want to be like any of my family members

But this won't be just about me. You don't have to talk to me 24/7, I'll listen. If you want to share a new band you got into, I would love to give them a listen and geek out about them with you. If you want to show me pictures of your cat/dog doing something silly, I would love to see them. I will even send you pictures of my cat, Puddin, who does nothing but sleep, each in different angles so it looks slightly fun to look at.

I guess that's it.

Before you message me:

* I'm putting in effort to get to know you

* Too much words with too much topics overwhelms me.

* Too little words with not much to talk about bores me.

* If you're an adult who can't spell words properly

* Messages like, ""do u hav skype lol"", ""want to see my dick"" will be ignored (even if said jokingly). Judging from those types of messages I know you won't be able to hold a proper conversation.

1345655731.0,yna6w,27 F4M Chicago - Depraved and deprived...,shamelessmess,50,12,17,"**FINAL UPDATE:** Found what I was looking for (I hope)! Until next time

**UPDATE:** Meeting someone for coffee this evening. Thanks all for your responses/support!

**UPDATE:** Something work-related came up so I will be a tad slower in getting back to you. Please disregard my ""10mins"" comment below as I will still try to get back to as many people as I can

I'm horny as hell and kinky as fuck. I'm generally not this forward or crass about it, I'd like an ongoing FWB arrangement. If it goes *very* well, I'm open to the idea of an LTR.


Since I'm being so frank


**PM me if you:**

* Live within 4hrs of Chicago

* Are a heterosexual unattached male

* Have been tested recently and have the paperwork to prove it

* Are familiar or proficient with kink

* Have something to say in your PM that will give me more insight into you and your personality

* Are not opposed to sending a **SFW** picture before we meet


**What I will do from here:**

From the PMs I get, as I'm sure you're for the most part decent folk, but I've posted before and have learned to have to cut out even good guys to get anywhere. **If you don't receive a response from me within 10 minutes of sending a PM, you are not going to.** It's probably nothing personal... it just means that I was either overwhelmed or found what I was looking for. **When I find what I'm looking for, I will update my post to indicate so.** This is also being x-posted to /r/chicagor4r and /r/BDSMpersonals. And now, the part you're probably curious about...

**About me:**

*The Basics* I'm 27 years old, brown eyes, 34D's, and I'm hairless from below the eyebrows.


*The Kink* I'm a sub who has been divorced for two years and am fresh out of a 10-month-long FWB arrangement with a Dom who decided to pursue a relationship. I'm limited to bedroom play for now. Good on you if you can convince me otherwise. Since this isn't /r/BDSMpersonals, this is an aspect of my sexuality that you will *have* to be okay and go along with as I can't get off without it.

1367671278.0,1dobv2,27 [M4F] Los Angeles - Sigh.. 10 months later and still looking for someone that will accept herpes.,itkeepsongiving,58,20,27,"10 months ago I made a post here wondering if I was the first person to use r4r to find someone else that has HSV-2.  You guys were kind enough to say a few encouraging words and upvote the post considerably for this subreddit.

Well.. 10 months later and I haven't had any luck in real life, etc.  It's getting to the point where I wonder if I'm ever going to be intimate with anyone again.  Statistics say something like a 20% of the population has genital herpes.. well I don't know where they're all hanging out at.

The thing that kills me is that I'm a good looking guy so I constantly have to turn girls away because I don't want to tell them I have herpes.  I've had the talk with 3 girls and all 3 cut it off at that moment.  I know you can't say this without sounding arrogant or self conceited but I think I'm a pretty damn good catch.  And yet, from talking to a few girls on dating sites.. guys largely do not care about getting HSV from their partners while the inverse is not true, girls care a lot more than guys.

Again.. I know this is conceited but, humorous, nice, driven, have my ducks in a row, etc. etc. and girls hit on me a lot.. but NOPE.. herpes.

Kill me.

Edit: Thanks for the support again.  One thing I did forget and want to mention as someone mentioned that herpes is with your for life so they'd personally never date anyone with it (I'm not saying anything's wrong with that viewpoint btw) is that might be the straw that broke the camels back in terms of my wallowing in self pity party.  I have had herpes for almost two years and I have NEVER had an outbreak.  0.00% herpes sores or anything.  The only reason I found out I was positive for it was getting routinely checked for STIs.  I got tested again thinking it was a false positive.  So for me it's an entirely social problem.  If you stubbed your toe,False,,t5_2rn0e,1367703384.0,,,t3_1dobv2

1320566853.0,m28jw,Actual R4R Success Story,Thadken,45,6,17,"Hello Reddit!  I have been meaning to submit this for some time

I went through all the steps, Match.com, OkCupid, and so on, but never was able to find a real connection with anyone.  I subscribed to R4R a little over a year ago.  I've never made a submission to R4R and really no submissions of worth to Reddit as a whole, but hope that this submission will at least spark some interest.

Six months ago I responded to an F4R from a woman on the other side of the country.  My initial contact wasn't anything particularly impressive.  I shared a couple interests, and before we knew it we had a daily schedule to speak every single day.  Not one that either of us discussed mind you, but just a desire to talk to each other couldn't be held off any longer than that.  We spoke of philosophy and literature, video games and movies, what we each wanted out of life, and what we'd rather avoid.  All of this sounds terribly vague I know, but it wasn't really the content that mattered

I have a past and secrets and faults and flaws, she was unflinching in her acceptance of me exactly as I am.  In all my years on this earth I have never known a woman so understanding and caring as her.  She supports me fully in everything I do, no matter how foolish it may seem.  She wants for nothing more than my happiness, and knows I will do anything to maintain hers.

Luckily I work from home and have packed up my work to come visit her.  I have been staying with her for a month now and have no shame in saying that I love her completely.  I am now a 27 year old man, and if the universe would be kind enough to grant me those thousand lives I would spend every day of them thanking the stars for delivering her to me.

I suppose that's it for now

Hi

We recently decided to implement /u/AutoModerator to help us sift through new posts and comments on /r/r4r! 

**What the heck is AutoModerator?**

Look no further. [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AutoModerator/comments/q11pu/what_is_automoderator/) is some information on the bot. For a TL;DR version: AutoModerator is a bot that has parameters set by us

**What kind of posts will the bot delete?**

There are a few things that we have the bot set to automatically delete:

1. Posts that do not follow the correct format of **Age [R4R] Location - Title**. In order for your post to *not be deleted*

2. Posts that do not use the correct letters for tags. The current letters we accept are **M, and R**. You *only* use those four letters. 

3. Posts that explicitly say that the user is under the age of 18. /r/r4r is an 18+ subreddit. 

4. Posts that use (R4R) and R4R instead of [R4R]. We never really cracked down on it before

5. Posts or comments that include personal information like usernames, etc. Of course, it might be a little difficult for the bot to find all of these things, so we would ask that you report a post or comment if you see personal information. 

**What does this mean for me?**

Glad you asked! Really

**Can you give me some examples of a good post and a bad post?**

Definitely. 

Here are examples of a *good post*:

**THE GIRL:**  I'm a Sophomore in College, reading, going out bowling, or whatever.  I'm always up for spur of the moment events and generally go with the flow-- which is funny since as relaxed as everyone says I am, I'm also generally a pretty sensitive person.

I am a very proud and outspoken geek.  Not in the douchebaggy way where I try to compete with people in pissing contests-- but in that I proudly wear my fandoms on my sleeves.  Literally.  I have a literary fandom tattooed to my shoulder and 90% of my torso wardrobe are shirts with some sort of Pop Culture/Game/Comic reference.  Not that that's uncommon.

I'm a sap.  Yup, if there's one thing I believe in, it's love.  Aside from the fact I grasp it's partially a chemical reaction-- but anyway. On the plus side-- I really don't get the marketed types of 'love'.  I don't do romance books much and while I like a good love story, most of them just make me laugh when it comes to book or film.  The bottom line is, I'm a very loyal and monogamous person.  If we're together, that's all that matters to me.  My eyes and heart are for that guy alone, but that's granted he likewise works with me to make sure we don't alienate the friends and other people in our lives that count.

**THE HOBBIES:**  I'm a gamer.  I do computer gaming and I also have a love for my console gaming.  I don't play the stupid games where I flame others for preferring one over the other, big Magic the Gathering player.

I love to read, Terry Pratchett, George R. R. Martin, JKR, Eoin Colfer, and... yeah, I'm not going to get into this list it takes too long.  Just, my school life would be even more amazing.

I enjoy plenty of things beyond the general nerd stuff.  I like building models, lazer tag, midnight movies, roaming, people watching, turning movies into an episode of MST3k, and... I dunno.  It's hard to know what all I want to do

**THE HOPE:**  I'm not going to lie (I'm a pretty blunt person, so if you don't think I'm your cup of tea, that's cool-- but if you are up for still being chat buds or even gaming pals, I'm more than happy to have you.

When it comes to dating, and caring person.  Sure, I have my problems too-- I'm oversensitive, can be a bit jealous, and hell... I'm just a person.  I'm not perfect.  But, I know that the sort of affection and love I can potentially give a person who gives me the time and attention needed to build the lasting relationship I want will never be disappointed with me.  There are few things I find unforgivable in life, but the idea of cheating is one of them-- so the whole unfaithfulness thing is obviously something that disgusts me.  I don't judge if you're a polyamorous sort of person, it's just not me.  So

I want to, if you'll indulge me... I want to be picked up from the airport. On the ride home [to mine or yours (I have an apartment in NYC), doesn't matter], I want you to pull over to the side of the road and stop the car. Order me to get out, push me up against the car and fuck me. Yeah... I can't get this little scenario out of my mind. Arghh. Also, I would be ideally wearing a skirt for easy access. Afterwards we can even fuck again in the safety of home and/or just part ways. Since we have a full month before this will even have a chance of happening, I would like to Skype on the regular to see if we even have any connection, so don't bother responding if you aren't willing to at least wave me hello.

A bit about me: I'm a thin, architecture/art, food, dancing, drinking, and just world/life exploration.  I have quite a few geeky tendencies, but, just fun!

Now

A male

I want a guy that knows and loves his city. I'm particularly interested in Washington DC, or another big city on the East Coast. But, Seattle or Portland may be a good choice... But you have to really KNOW your city! I want to see the underground stuff. I want to go see a house show at some friend's house. I want to go to some hole-in-the-wall bar that not many people know about.  I want to eat at an awesome teeny-tiny Vietnamese restaurant that isn't all ""the rage.""  All of these are just examples, of course.

So, this won't be until Spring, but, I need to start the decision-making and planning process now (since I work full-time and have to give notice).

PM me first!! feel free to send a picture. I'll send you guys one back.  Thanks for your time


**Edit:** Thanks for all the nice messages, but, this trip is all about getting to see some parts of the US or possibly Canada (and some fellow US/Canadian Redditor) that will be new to me! 

Oh, I go dutch, so, I will of course be paying all of my expenses, since I'm kind of ""dating"" you for the week. Yeahh, that's right, paranoid guys out there-- I'm really in it for the fun and the experience!

First of all

I'm also shy. Exceptionally shy. I've had great friends and great times, I'm lonely. When it's is all you've known for most of your life, you learn how to deal with it, but it still sucks. Now I'm making an effort to see if I can change my life for the better.

I'm not so shy that I can't to talk to people. I'm shy in the sense that it's extremely hard for me to make the first move on women. I know how to make conversation and small talk, it's crippling and I know it's a problem. In the very few times I've been romantic with someone, they were the first to make the move. By the way, I can't even tell you how happy it makes me when this happens.

When people find out about my situation

I don't care about casual sex and never really wanted it. The same goes for one night stands. Personally

I'm not looking for advice on how to get laid. Despite being a virgin

Here's a brief description of my appearance, caucasian, long hair (dark blonde), glasses. I'm told I'm handsome from time to time by ladies other than my mom and sister (but they tell me I am too).

I know I've said little to nothing about the rest of what I do or enjoy in life

I can't hear myself? .... GOOD!

*tosses the microphone away*

I'm hoping to find a female who would like to hang out with me, I travel to both cities pretty often for some fun times.  I go around the large Deaf communities and would expect you to join along to have some fun.

It would range from going to clubs, watch some big movies together, and even hang out at some friends' places.

I am hoping that this female is Deaf but it's not really important. Knowing ASL would be awesome and be more easier.

But if you do not know ASL but want to learn - hit me up but meeting in person is a must. Just be warned that our date will be when I would like to meet at Starbucks, and when I sit down on this couch, I would smile at your pretty eyes knowing that I'm going to change your world.

I love all sorts of music, Avett Brothers, Iron &amp; Wine, Sigur Ros, Bon Iver, and Ben Howard.  But I've been known to listen to everything from Marilyn Manson to Hoodie Allen.

I love to learn about politics, but I've toned that down quite a bit so that I can actually have conversations with people.

In my free time I love to knit, or just curl up with an animal and watch Netflix.  I'm a dog and cat foster mom, so I deal with a lot of poop and get a lot of love in return.

We don't agree with the model of a family that is a male and female parent raising their children by themselves. But that's where we are nonetheless. 

This could be a romantic and sexual relationship, but we want more people to love and live with much much more than we want more people to fuck. I only bring it up because we want that too and we wouldn't want to scare away the people who are looking for a romantic and sexual relationship even though that is our secondary concern. Ideally we would love to have another sex partner or another female to have babies with. But we don't need orgasms and procreation anywhere near as much as we need people to love and to love us.

We have room for another adult without any economic contribution. We don't have rules in our house other than don't be a dick. We're most interested in finding someone who would want to live and learn with us. We have no preconceived notion of how a human life should be lived.

We live in an awesome town and free room and board as long as you are willing to jive with us is a pretty sweet deal in this town. I am constantly doing awesome projects and inventing things so maybe you could be taken into the fold as a little brother or little sister type person and I could teach you some awesome stuff. If you have nothing to learn from us then you could take on the role of wise aunty or uncle who just loves to share their knowledge.

No one lived within miles of us, and people rarely visited, save my father's clients. My dad did speciality work, fine arts and artisan items that rich people commissioned from him. He actually maintained a full armory, and you can imagine what fun it was for me when he'd let me try out the things he kept! I no this will sound tragic

Fortunately, and I've devoted my life to finding justice for my father and people like him. I've also made many friends. I met this big guy, my closest friend. He's twice the size of anyone I've ever seen, and four times nicer. Sure, at times he can be as thick as bricks, but we get along well and I wouldn't trade his friendship for the world. I also knew a crazy Italian man, he was a business partner and mentor

After my most recent business stint, somewhat flighty, but he's the only person I know who's better educated and quicker witted than I am! I'm helping him out these days, but it's a secondary sort of thing to me.

&gt;There's no way to maximize your response rate's quality while simultaneously optimizing quantity. ... You'll either get a lot of crappy messages (if you're a girl) or a few [often mediocre] responses (if you're a guy). The system cannot produce anything else.

1. This subreddit's method of ""matching"" people (which is basically shooting wildly into the dark at random hoping to hit a moving target) cannot optimize both quality and quantity. 

2. Put another way

2. The subreddit's demographics are probably against you too - the posts and responses are largely from (1) American (2) Caucasian (3) straight (4) men (5) who tend to like video games. You won't get much diversity of response here. Unless this is your type I guess.

3. Same goes for the girlposts too - *tons* of white gamer girls here and not much else. It's fine if you're really into gaming

There's *nothing wrong with having standards* and making them clear to your audience. But before you get frustrated with R4R

* Is the person you're looking for likely to be on this forum looking for companionship now or in the near future?

* Or would they be out doing something else that you could easily join in? If so

Last of all

The **real** reason you aren't getting lots of quality responses isn't because you're a terrible human being, random, and pure dumb luck. You don't really control whether or not someone will reply to your post or message at all.

Sending dick pics definitely doesn't help

**TL;DR**: Can you taste the irony here guys? CAN YOU?!

I study and practice archaeology, finding things that were intimate to them, it's just, wow.
Fitness is very important in my life, how I sleep, how I plan my day etc. Working out itself is a very spiritual (not religious, just like, brings you closer to your humanity) experience for me.
I like to keep myself busy with random stuff, and my kitchen is filled with like 40-year old appliances, and I've got an old record player on which I play original LPs, the sound is just amazing. I can spend hours in a record store that has like a back room with second-hand records
Other things I fill my time with include mostly watching sitcoms, I just don't get out much because I like to do the things that I do, I'm not really shy. What I would like though is someone who can help me discover new things, things they're into, things they like, and discover things with. 
I have very strong, life is unfair and it's up to you to make the best out of it, do whatever the hell you want really. Honesty and trust are also very important to me, in a relationship especially.

What I am looking for is a girl/woman between the ages of 18-26. Someone who knows EXACTLY what they want and stick with it. Someone who is into a mature relationship, you're just two people who have a special bond together and decide to share a great number of wonderful things, which includes your thoughts and feelings. Someone who doesn't get tired of affection and appreciation. Yes, I am clingy, when I believe someone is special and interesting I don't feel there's a reason to not express that and remind that person of just how special she is to me.
I'd love to have someone who can sometimes just sit inside all day with me and do nothing at all. Poke my cat together for a while, play some music, whatever. I'd love to go out and do couple-ey stuff, but what makes a relationship for me special is that you are just.. together and enjoy things together because it's just... a joint experience. You're not two strangers who are trying to get at something, you're two people in a relationship, you share, you know what you enjoy together
That brings me to the next topic which is sex. I LOVE sex, but I do have a high libido and girls have had the impression in the past that I just wanted them for sex, while for me it's like... a package deal. Sex is an amazing and intimate experience you share and you can do INCREDIBLE things to and for eachother, it's a wonderful part of a relationship, and a relationship with lack of sex is just... empty to me. Like I said before, you share yourselves together, and shutting any part of yourself off for the other is just like you're two strangers. I'm incredibly devoted to any relationship

I am a 21 year old woman living in Utah. Maybe you’re from Utah which is great or maybe you’re not which is also good cause I like talking to people. I’m going to try and avoid all the clichés and say “I’m a fun loving girl, and I would love to travel” because that basically describes anyone with a heartbeat. So instead I’m just going to throw some things out there. 

I really wish bioluminescent trees were a thing. Imagine a world where streetlamps are replaced by glowing trees. And if I could have any super power in the world


I have a horrible addiction. It’s almost crippling. Seriously

I’ve watched the Lord of the Rings trilogy more times than anyone should

I’ve had a tiny bit too many drinks. Liquid courage. So I will wrap this up so I can dance and sing horribly. 


Maybe what I said has piqued some interest in you. In that case you should totally PM me cause that’s what you’re supposed to do on here. Otherwise you just wasted a lot of time reading this for no reason.

 Or if you’re not still tell me.

1339534652.0,uyl4l,[M4F] 28 Seattle - The Perfect* Man :-),mattontheinternet,34,5,16,"I'll get the ""negatives"" out of the way

I'm short for a guy, I am also quite athletic--between exercising a few minutes every day, eating healthily, sleeping decently, and just generally taking care of myself, I'm in great shape. Muscular and trim with a flat stomach--I've kicked it up another notch, beginning my training and preparation for a mountaineering expedition in September.

I am a little more sensitive than most guys.  I need to have good

Most people can't honestly claim to be the total package. I believe I can.

**Why I am the perfect man:**

I am clean and smell good all the time. My beard is soft and typically neatly groomed.  My teeth are all present and accounted for, but that's simply not my style--I won't judge you for having a few, or not having any. I am pretty darn good at giving massages. Personal hygiene is important to me--it is a sign of respect for myself and for those around me. I've still got my beard from Mo-vember, but have tamed it since then.  Who knew that facial hair lead to constant compliments?  I am confident enough in my masculinity that I have a pink shirt--it looks amazing on me, so I actually wear it. I am not hung up about sex, our bodies, or talking about them. Or talking about feelings. In fact

I have had my own place for the last four years. I have a decent, successful and have my shit together. I am a self-made man who has earned every accomplishment he has. At times, my schedule can be hectic, but it is always flexible. I can and will find or make time for the important people in my life, even if it can seem like my head is in the sand. I don't have any kids--unless you count my faithful, affectionate, and fuzzy animal companion. I love to travel and learn about other cultures. I just need to get the travel part down more seriously--now that I have the means I find that time is in short supply.  Six of one, aye?

I am always open to and enjoy learning and trying new things. I love blues and classic rock (and a lot more), I feel that spontaneity and variety are very important to keep life interesting. I try to push my comfort zones and to avoid falling into routines. I'll admit when I'm wrong (once I realize it) and would always rather talk through problems than let them stew and boil over. I'm looking for the same. If we make plans, I will not flake out on you. Nor will I flake on you--no dandruff, here. I'm all for gender equality and I would say that I am a feminist, perhaps more truthfully than some ""actual feminists"". I'll still treat you to dinner and open the door for you, though. 

I once had an awkward date--just to see what it was like.

A few traits that may be important--I am atheist/agnostic, especially medicine/biology and anything related to space.

I am child-free, energy, and money towards helping them become wonderful, intelligent, and worldly people, as well as helping others who are less fortunate and doing what I can to make the world a better place. I feel I can do so much more good by--and be much happier with--simply not reproducing, and there are many more reasons that brought me to this lifestyle and this decision--something that always makes for fascinating conversation.

The woman I am looking for is attractive, but has something to teach me. This lovely lady is my height or shorter. Just looking at her gives me butterflies in the stomach--physical attraction is very important to me, but that is a prerequisite rather that a defining characteristic. She enjoys learning, discovering, and trying new things. She has a healthy sense of humor with some sass and sarcasm. Someone who can stand on her own, but isn't afraid to ask for help or lean on others. She is patient and understanding with the people she cares about, but is not afraid to speak up when something bothers or upsets her. She enjoys coffee, and a good beer, like myself, emotionally

Don't be shy--write me and tell me a little about yourself.  The basics obviously, and send a few photos--we'll go from there!  Perhaps meet up for coffee/tea/happy hour?

[Here's me!](http://imgur.com/a/y0fyX)

I'm not up to date with all Internet law, if a 12 year old girl sees a big (tagged NSFW or not) and is scarred, the family has a tort and might have a case in court because the forum was not officially 18+. Labeling the forum as 18+ OFFICIALLY removes liability from the poster, mods, and reddit and places the liability on the kid and parents.
R4R needs to be 18+ unless it specifically and officially bans any and all adult content. This would require extremely dedicated moderating. The best and most sensible option is making it 18+ and leaving it up to someone else to create an /r/teenr4r where the stated rules of no adult content could and would be strictly enforced.


Anyways

**I am so freaking dumb UPDATE!!**
I think I just figured out if you put ""NSFW"" in your title that the red NSFW tag comes up next to your post, the posts will still default to not having a NSFW tag. More updates coming.

**!!!Another update!!!**

I'm a 30-something, you know how intense and mind-blowing the orgasms are... it's seriously one of the hottest things for me to be a part of.  I can't help but wonder how erotic it would be to experience with a strap-on.  Because of this, I've been fantasizing about pegging a willing partner for several months now... the thought of trying it irl excites me very much.

For the record
I'm seeking a mutual interest, this is more of a ""W seeking M who is compatible and happens to be interested in pegging too"" post.  I'd like my first time to be as comfortable, pleasurable, and memorable as possible.  If it happens to be your first time too, I would hope to give you a similarly positive experience. 

My current preferences are as follows:

* Single (this means **no** GF/BF

* Straight male (but open to bisexuals.)

* Some experience in anal play, please have put a finger in your ass before you claim you're into butt play. ;P

* Prefer literate, and not living at home.

* Must be discrete and trustworthy.

* Not psychotic/a stalker/a serial killer.

I left out a specific location because if I find the right partner(s) (laugh)

I'm fairly good with shy

**To save time for everyone

* Age, and a description of what you look like (height, build, skin/eye/hair color, etc.).  
  
* I'd also love a little info about you: your personality, etc.

* Also, please let me know. 

If you're willing to share a pic (no, by all means... but I certainly don't expect one right away.

If the experience goes well

If you're still reading *and* with interest

So here goes...

 I'm a foreign girl and I've been living in Istanbul for awhile. I'm not looking for a relationship - I am looking for a specific kind of booty call /friends with benefits kind of thing.

Basically I want a threesome. Preferably with two STRAIGHT guys! I already have one guy willing to do this and I want one more. I have done this before and I think I am pretty good at multitasking :P.... But its been a few years.

So if you're interested I'd like to hear more about you and maybe see a picture of you WITH YOUR CLOTHES ON. I'll assume you have a dick somewhere and I really don't care about its particulars... I'm sure it'll be fine.  I am choosing this on looks (FACE - body really isn't that important) and PERSONALITY.  So if you want to stand any chance you are going to have to tell me about yourself or tell me a funny story or anything that will stand you apart from the 100 guys from Craigslist who sent me dick pictures and sentence on how they are hung and can fuck me blah blah blah.  I don't need to see anything sexy - this is going to be hilarious the first time and then if we do it again it might get better.  But I want it soon!

As for me I'm a funky geek and I will spend this threesome with 50/50 moaning and laughing my ass off - its all about fun.  I'm 25 years old and people assure me that I'm cute.  

That being said I'd be interested in meeting girls or couples too but I would still like this doubleteam. If all goes well it'll be something we can do every month or so - no strings attached.

1340891668.0,vqnrc,22F4 LOCAL friend or relationship in Cincinnati; This is the real me,electroqueen,36,12,106,"Hi

Firstly, that means I sometimes mention suicide or avoid doing certain things because I'm scared. Such as driving which I have an irrational fear of. I imagine one day I will be able to overcome this fear and get my license but just not at this exact moment in time. I am also very heartbroken right now. I never believed in something so much as I did the relationship that just recently ended. I am having a very hard time dealing with it on top of my normal depression. Basically, to sum this all up, I am emotionally intense. You might consider that dramatic but besides my sadness and heartbreak, I'm generally not a drama filled person. Just so you know, I am taking strides to get better. 

Now

Personality-wise, straight-forward, smart, sarcastic, caring, dedicated, somewhat creative, needy, I have way too much free-time especially because I can't handle a job at this moment in time. So, fighting games

What I am looking for is a friend (female preferably) or a relationship. A companion of some sort. I'd like to hang out as much as possible. I'm fine with just chilling and talking, sweet puppy, Jemma, and watching T.V. Maybe you could get me into Star Wars or something else I've never seen. Maybe you could help me get back into volunteering or photography, both of which I used to love doing. Perhaps, you have a console and a fighting game and I can whoop your ass. I just don't want to be alone and entertain any thoughts that are going to make me more stuck than I am now. I can say that if we get close that I will be your dedicated friend. I will give you almost everything I have to offer. I will do a lot to make you feel loved. 

Please don't message me if you beat around the bush a lot. I don't need to waste time on bullshit when you can just be straight forward with me. Just tell me what you motherfucking want.

Second of all, posting this here, but why not? It can't hurt. 

I am planning to attend college in the fall, I want a family. I will probably get called out for subscribing to gender stereotypes here, but what I want is the typical family dynamic. I'm looking for a partner!

I would be a very good house wife. I am a great cook and love to bake... I am great at organizing things, love to read and learn, and can hold a great conversation. I also clean up pretty well. I am great at researching things, bargain hunting, and make a mean batch of brownies :) I love to do little things for my friends to make them smile, like send cards or care packages randomly and without warning. In my spare time, I love to read, and watch stuff on Netflix. 

I am a spiritual person. I was raised Catholic, I have also not had sex. I'm waiting for a serious relationship to do that.

I'm pretty open minded on what I'm looking for. Honestly I always picture myself as settling down with someone in the military

Thanks everyone :)

really is something special. I'm a 21yo guy who met this girl on reddit(r/foreveralonedating) on may 9th
and we started talking
and she in Washington state
skyping for about 5 to 7 hours a day for almost every single day for two months. Shes
so perfect and beautiful
than just being her best friend. I can talk about absolutely anything
with her
to talk and communicate is by far our best quality and what 
makes us strongest. So after I started getting feelings for her
it was really scary
already my best friend. So I tried to kinda ignore them and hope
that theyd go away but I soon realized that I was being silly.
I could have tried and convinced myself for weeks that she wasn't so perfect
for me and that she wasnt the sweetest girl Id ever met
just be me being in denial because she was all I thought of her and more.
Im 21 and shes almost 19
before we met
serious and only plan on being in one. We feel that a relationship
that starts should already at that point have certain 'vows' that
come with it
emotions. I always thought that when the right girl for me would come 
along
princess nothing has ever been more clear than our destined long
future together. 

A little less than two months after we first started
talking
biggest risk I ever took in my life. She was surprised and just 
confused at first
another time
and she was going away for the weekend
time for us to not be able to talk for a couple days. She did a lot
of thinking during her weekend away
again on Monday (it felt like a month away on Friday night)
said she also has feelings for me beyond that best friends have
and was willing to give a long distance relationship a try. 

This was July 9th
could honestly say I love this girl more and more each day. She means
the world to me and everything with her is just so effortless. We knew
from the beginning that a long distance relationship would be hard
we were convinced that theres nothing we wouldnt be able to work through. 
And we were right
nothing I dream of more than just being with her one night
will come and the wait would make it the best day ever
that day that most people would probably never come close to feeling. Theres 
no better feeling in the world than feeling loved for exactly who you
are
or try and do more than we were comfortable with
with each other all the time. We dont have to worry about us being upset with 
each other or even us not being together at any point
promised to work through all the issues that will ever come up
exactly what we've done so far. I know this might sound silly
my sister will always be my sister no matter what our future holds
is as just permanent of a girlfriend to me. We even picked out our kids name one day
already. We already told pretty much all our family about each other
started talking to and getting to know her friends and sister.

The reason we wanted to share this with you guys is so you realize that love
is out there to find
feel for each other because its truly amazing. Just keep at it
do yourself short. Theres someone out there that will make each of you feel
so happy and loved all the time
I never would have thought that I would find a girl for me in the next five years at least
but I'm blessed to have found her
and I cant wait to hear about all of you finding love so pure that it comes with 
zero doubts or second thoughts. Thanks for reading :)

Here is my OKCupid profile (most of it

And here's a pic: http://i.imgur.com/ZodmB.jpg

**Self Summary:**

I have been told that I have a very quirky sense of humor

Let's see, I do a pretty good job of it.

I really like to travel. I've been to NYC a few times

Discovery Health or a medical drama is usually what you'll find me watching if cable is available. Nothing beats a great ""before and after"" or learning about some rare and disfiguring disease. Trust me

FYI - I don't work out or play sports. I notice a lot of guys here want a girl that works out. That's not me. I like going on walks or hikes and sight-seeing


**What I'm doing with my life:**

I am in graduate school for a Master's degree in journalism. I'm also a teaching assistant for the journalism department.

My dream is to own property with a beautiful house for me and several cabins on it that I rent out.


**Favorites:**

I love to find really off-beat fiction and non-fiction. ""Kissing in Manhattan"" by David Schickler and ""First Person Plural"" by Dr. Cameron West are two of my favorites!

I really love watching good stand-up comedy. Robert Schimmel (RIP)
As far as TV goes, Raising Hope, Dexter, Louie, Grey's Anatomy, and Real Time with Bill Maher. Hulu is a good thing.

Rainy days are a favorite of mine. Whether I just make a cozy

When it comes to traveling


**Looking for:**

Straight guys only

Ages 27-35

Near me

Who are single

For long-term dating


**Message me if:**

You are a non-smoker, and not religious.


**My stats:**

Ethnicity - White

Height - 5′ 3″ (1.60m).

Body Type - Thin

Smokes - No

Drinks - Rarely

Drugs - Never

Religion - Atheism and very serious about it

Education - Graduated from college/university

Job - Education / Academia

Children - Likes &amp; Wants children (eventually)

Pets - Likes dogs and has cats

Male, etc! I really really enjoy talking dirty to someone. I find it's amazingly engaging for me and it's amazingly good mental exercise. You have to think really quickly, you have no time to pause and it's about building a mental atmosphere and sort of directing people around in their own imaginations with what you say.

I'm really not segwaying into 'hey sup turn ur cam on', and happily enjoy doing it just as a learning thing. The more I try it out, with different people, the better I get. I'm told I'm getting dangerously good.

This is really no strings; my time-zone might be most opportune for a lot of people but it's just light-fun, lie back, close your eyes and I'll try my best.

Again, I just want to practise and talk to as many people about it as possible.

Oh

Anyway! Hopefully this wont sink into the bowls of hell and I'll get at least one taker. I'm really pessimistic that this seems an elaborate scheme

Toodles!

Well, just working. I graduated with dual bachelors degrees in Chemistry and Criminal Justice - wanting to work in Forensics. I couldn't find anything in the field, and got a chance to work abroad. Now I teach kids - and I really like it. I'm considering trying to work toward teacher certification in the US when I return. 

I'm somewhere between 5'6"" and 5'7"", quietly go along your way, please. I'm learning to live with it. I have my moments of hating the way I look - but by and large, I am usually a really happy person. Blue eyes, hair that varies between brown and blonde shades - somewhat depending on how recently I've dyed it. I have lost track of my natural hair color - but it's somewhere between those two colors as well. 

I'm geeky enough to be on reddit, and I am okay with that. I finally watched Indiana Jones a few years ago, and admittedly I was hooked. :3 I also got into Doctor Who semi-recently, and I adore Tennant (though to be fair I have only watched 9th Doctor - present). I am in love with the BBC miniseries of Sherlock and would like season 3 immediately, please. 

I watch MLP:FiM

I am a huge fan of Japanese pop music from one group in particular. It's unlikely to be the first one you think of. I listen to other music

I love Disney animated movies, and small accents in Disney are pretty darn cute. 

I'm a picky eater. Like, iPad mini, iPod - I have it all. I won't spout off about how they're the OMGBESTEVER - they just happen to work well for me. 

I like making people happy, pretty shy in person - except at work. I don't go out much, I don't like crowds. Small gatherings are okay.

I'm coming up to Sydney before I start uni in Melbourne and so, so I thought I'd see who bites before I resort to craigslist.

Basically, I want those guys to fuck me every way they can.

All I ask is that you cum on me, tits - I don't care, as long as it's on me in the end.

My name is Justin. I am 24, did my undergrad at Northwestern University, and ended up in sunny San Diego for grad school for a PhD in materials science and engineering with a focus on biomaterials fabrication for tissue engineering. Although that's my main focus, it's not the only thing about me. 

Now to the point. Almost every year while I was in KC

What I propose is a date. I'd like to dress up a bit and take someone out for a nice early dinner before the ballet. Unfortunately the ballet is at 7 pm and I would be famished if I didn't eat before. Low blood sugar. I blame my mother's genes. So a nice dinner downtown, there is no expectation of funny business on the first date.

If you're an intelligent gal, fun, and caring, with a great sense of humor, who's also interested in this date and potentially more, then, PM me with your age, and some of your interests. And I'll in turn send one back =). Whew

Lets converse on PM or Skype and get to know each other a bit. Not too much

First of all

So. It's Saturday night and I'm laying in bed, but go to school in Burlington, VT and it would be great if you're located close to one of those, but not mandatory. 

Here's five facts about me:

1. I don't really party. Or drink/smoke. I don't find the appeal in it and it's expensive. I can enjoy a nice glass of wine but I have a hard time being friends with partiers. 

2. I am a firm believer that it is the little things that make life great. A few coats of nail polish, and little surprises are some of my favorite things. I'm feeling a bit like I put in way more to all of the relationships in my life- I just want someone who'll go equal with me.

3. ACK I don't know what to say for this one. I'm super jumpy

4. I'm studying journalism but I don't want to be a journalist. I would like to work in admissions for a college. But journalism is pretty cool

5. I'm a huge fan of Harry Potter, HIMYM, Doctor Who, and Firefly. I love really terrible reality TV- like Sister Wives. The last TV show I watched was American Horror Story on Netflix. I'm currently reading Graceling by Kristen Cashore.

I'd like to start by saying that if you're an ""average"" redditor, and I only ""cri eRRy TYmE"" when I watch Forrest Gump and he does the monologue at Jenny's grave.

Really though, I'm not a socially awkward kind of guy so I'm usually the one feeding the elephant in the room peanuts. It's not to say that I start controversy, it's just that I don't mind talking about things people are afraid to talk about. However, listening to people is way better because I learn more from them than I do from myself.  The most surreal feeling I've ever felt is going over 200mph in a car, and the thing that scares me the most is routine.  I've done a lot of things that most people haven't, and most people do things that I haven't. My ultimate goal is to put my creative ability to use to make enough money to live comfortably with enough time to enjoy the comfortability. To me, those that achieve this balance are the happiest people.

a full moon and a cool breeze
* getting under a warm blanket when it's cold and cuddling with someone you love

*I will actually talk at normal
*I'm not physically deformed!

I came across a somewhat local Redditor through another member's post. He was in the comments, so it was very hard to find. Turns out, the brewery in an actual warehouse. We had a great time tasting the beers and eating goat cheese hot dogs...which must have been created by the gods. I'm pretty sure I'm not alone when I say that my mouth was jizzing from the awesomeness.  

I then decided to post an R4R, something like that usually happens when I meet new people. He enjoyed it so much, he returned the next week, even when I wasn't there because of my ankle.

Last night there were 4 of us, and holy balls, it was awesome! I feel that we hit it off great, the alcohol didn't hurt either. One of the Redditors even went and told one of the beer presenters that I have been gawking over his godly beard and got him to come over so that I can caress it. Creepy?

I decided to post a very specific profile of my interests in the hopes that there's someone out there like me to become friends with or more. So here are some things I like in no particular order.

**1.) Anime:** I've been watching since I was six years old and have been hooked since. I know it's not everyone's cup of tea, and the fantastic settings that anime provides. 

**2.) Video games**: Oh boy. Just like anime, Super Smash Bros. Brawl, Mass Effect, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, Zelda games, Pokemon games etc. I'm currently playing Portal. I also bought during the Steam sale Bioshock, Amnesia: The Dark Descent

**3.) Literature:** I'm a bibliophile. I love books to death. I think reading is a pleasure in life that I wish more people understood. 

**4.) Horror/Dark/Thriller movies and TV shows:** I do enjoy all sorts of movies (for the most part), Fight Club, Memento, The Silence of the Lambs, Pulp Fiction, and Pan's Labyrinth. I also hate romantic-comedies. As for TV shows, my all-time two favorites are Dexter and Breaking Bad. I also like comedy shows like It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, and The Simpsons.

**5.) Heavy Metal:** Sadly, Death metal, among others.

**6.) Drawing:** It's a hobby of mine. 

**7.) Martial Arts:** I'm always trying to improve

**8.) Science:** I just graduated with a degree in Biology and I hope I will become a doctor someday. I knew from an early age that I would study science since I always had my head in anatomy books.

**9.) Traveling:** I have lived in Chile

**10.) Community Service/Activism:** Before you look at me funny

And I think that about covers it! If you like some of the things listed here, I would be happy to talk to you, and perhaps meet up!

Bottom line, cry with, and be downright shit scared with. I am without this companion ship due to lack of options- after being with the same person for a number of years, you tend to alienate yourself, and getting back out there isn't much of a doable thing with a job like mine .

I'm a decent looking guy of the nerdy persuasion. (Obviously) I love Doctor Who, but I do have certain things about a girl that I like- can't be blamed for that. I'm a professional go-to guy, which means I can do just about anything that pays well enough (and is legal).

Right now, wherever- if it works, it will work and distance won't matter. Especially when there's a big, blue box involved!

You: Should be clean, accepting of my quirky awesomeness. Should be understanding, healthy, and willing to try new things- especially if you plan on going on adventures. You should also be open or at least accepting to the fact that I am of the pagan persuasion- if you don't know, ask. I love talking about it and explaining. I'm open to anyone of any religious background. Also, no neo-conservatives. Sorry ladies, I'm a far left liberal, doubly so. Not picky of location

Gird your loins and grab the drool buckets in preparation for the awesomeness I am about to unleash on you! The proverbial sex bomb is here

To be fair, and I'm writing this for him. I owe him a favour, and I'm repaying it.... without him knowing it. At best? He finds the lady of his dreams. At worst? She's a trap; either way, hilarity ensues.

This sexy stud-muffin is a one of a kind kinda guy; certainly not your average head case or average redditor (yes ladies, perfume, and anti-zombie pheromones. A bit of magic in his lab (which will leave your breathless, nonetheless), a wink and a sarcastic quip, and this veritable vestibule of manliest manliness will have your hearts desire in his flask, ready to dose you up, and anywhere else you want a good dosing *waggles eyebrows*.

Too good to be true? I know. I too feel the same. If it weren't for the fact we share the same sexual organs (well

So, the scum of the universe; McDonald's. Whilst that doesn't resonate with the awesomeness you've come to expect of this awe-gasmic specimen, I've come to believe this; how can any person justify such talent that, if it weren't for his sublime physique, we could be excused for thinking he was the Second Coming of Raptor-Jesus. 

No longer does this apex of alpha masculinity work for such a whorish corporation; after taking some time to invent quantum-physics, and challenge him it did; but in unforeseen ways.

After trying to subjugate this paradigm of penile plentessitude as most courses do (sleepless nights, my friend was offered this choice; a sacrifice for knowledge of himself. What was this sacrifice? Half the light of the world to save the world; one of his eyes. Any lesser man, yea, any other MORTAL would have shied away from this chance to delve into his inner character in fear, but when asked ""Now you know the cost, can you continue on? Is it really worth the price?"" he simply replied with ""I pay it gladly"" and surrendered his eye to the vicissitudes of fate. But the price was much more than that; he lost his job, his girlfriend left him and, lost his faith in his path.

It was a dark time for us all; it was if a light had gone out in the heavens, looked deep within himself and trawled the worth of his soul. Muttering quietly to himself, he searched for the meaning within himself for what seemed like 9 days and nights; impaling himself with his reason and watering the tree of knowledge with his life's blood and anguish. 

After this time, gazed from deep within the void whilst his other window to his soul beheld the wonders of this world), my friend said ""I will find a path, or make one"" and proceeded to do so.

Unbeknownst to him, the feeling of what was being said transcended language and struck him to the core. As a result, my friend was gifted with a Bachelor's degree in Philosophy; such was his depth of understanding.

Not content with one degree

So, he teaches children in his spare time as a tutor and a instructor in a youth organisation.

What does he like? Such intellect can appreciate a wide range of things, industrial and many things in between; as long as their is complexity and beauty beyond the ""normal"" he can at least appreciate it. 

Food? Yes. He is a vegetarian, before proceeding to tear it off, they threatened to kill every kitten they could find if he refused not to eat meat. 

Why would this stop him? I don't know. 

Surely, whist tearing ALL the faces off these assholes? He assures me that he couldn't (more humility!) so, rather than risk the life of one little cute kitty cat, he has staunchly decided to renounce meat forever more.

What more could you want to know? He has a car, hiking, powered hang-gliding and does martial arts. Why does he do martial arts? He says it is so that he can protect the people he loves, but I think it is because he is lazy. Lazy? That doesn't make any sense, I hear you say! However, to that I say this; such a mind-boggling polymath, such a PILLAR of destruction could easily make nuclear war look like a cake-walk, it would take too much effort and he'd rather invent molecules that look like puppies than waste such effort. Thus

What does he look like? Well, with dark brown hair and Caucasian. He's fit, although not ripped; personally, I think this is because he has genetically engineering himself to be that way so as not to make all other men inferior in comparison.

How come this man is single? I ask myself the same thing before I sleep a night; it seems a crime against nature. Firstly, because he is so unique, like all rare and precious things, finding anyone else with a similar lustre is a hard thing indeed.

Now, and the entire Russian Spetsnaz, however I'd best give you all a heads up as to his tastes in women to increase your chances, and so the paradox of his sweet soft voice and razor sharp humour doesn't send you insane with desire at the first syllable.

He likes natural redheads. As in, who can comprehend the mind of the divine? I know he likes girls who are his height, or shorter (say shorter than 175 cm) who can hold an intelligent conversation and has an interest on a wide range of topics. He is well read, with a voracious interest in the novel and random, so any ladies like that will do well there. He likes to explore the crass as well as the classy, the dark as well as the light, so anyone easily offended need not apply. Sex? Definitely. However, and you won't be able to share your bed with another man without the thought of this cunning linguist crossing your mind. Ladies who are insecure and need someone to constantly pander to their drama are not for this man; why would he need drama when he could just read Greek literature? He sees the good in people regardless of how deep it is buried

What more is left to be said? He is single, so here it is. If you think you can handle getting to know a future doctor of science, a philosopher, polymath, martial artist, comedian and brother from another mother to yours truly, then post away.

I'm 22. 5'7"" 120 lbs. People tell me I'm pretty. I love anything outdoorsy. Hiking, caving, jumping off rocks into rivers, all that good stuff. I really would like to start white water kayaking sometime soon. So if you have any experience with that, that would be awesome! I graduated college and have a good full-time job. I'm somewhat introverted until I'm comfortable with someone, then I'm just quirky and fun. I don't have a facebook and have never been on any dating sites. I love all kinds of music (except country), but I've really been enjoying electronic music lately. I love horror movies and can do some mean zombie makeup. I also really enjoy a good snuggle. When I watch tv it's usually Discovery channel, or Bio. I love my pets.

**EDIT**: So no

I think I'm going to create a single template answer for why /r/suicidewatch sucks and use it for all the self-righteous people who think that *that* subreddit is the way to go. So here goes:

1) I've already been on there

2) Everyone there is good natured, I just want attention and friends.

3) There's a bunch of good natured and similarly depressed people on there who'll tell you something along the lines of 'Hey man

There are basically two reasons why I find it really difficult to commit suicide:

1) I don't know if it *won't* be physically painful - I don't like physical pain.

2) When I do get some courage to get over point 1, I get *very* afraid there still might be hope, and I realize I might not be ready to flush it all away.

Just because I find it difficult to actually fucking commit suicide does not mean I feel empty or even suicidal. It's only a matter of time until point 2 won't be of any help.

However, then the TROLLS FUCKING WON. However, if you just give everyone the benefit of doubt and do your best, then out of those MILLION trolls you'll help out that *one* person who was serious.

So some questions you might have:

1)  What the hell is an [IRC](http://bit.ly/z5yvbK)?

It's essentially a text based chatroom for real time communicating.

2)  Interesting.  How do I access this IRC thingy?

You first need to download a client to connect to the network.  Much like MSN, AIM, gTalk.  You need something that can communicate with the IRC servers and make all that technical nonsense into something your eye sacs can comprehend.  For windows based users, [mIRC](www.mirc.com) is the most popular.  For OSX users [limechat](http://limechat.net/mac/) and [babbel](http://www.babbelirc.com/index.lasso?go=download) are popular clients.  For you linux users if you cannot manage to find an IRC client or connect to freenode you have brought great shame.

There is also an awesome browser based client for freenode found [here](http://webchat.freenode.net/).  But that ruins all the fun :(

3) So I just wasted like 5 seconds downloading these stupid programs now what?

You have to connect to freenode.  For many of the clients, check out [this](http://freenode.net/irc_servers.shtml) page to find the closest freenode server to connect to.

My taste in movies has been described as somewhat...eclectic. I can find equal enjoyment in German art films from the 70s, Transformers...and fucking Twilight.

I saw the first one fully expecting to hate it but found myself absorbed by the goofy melodrama of it all. It's like watching a stupid soap opera--I know it's bad *but I can't look away.* I watched the other two on DVD and got hooked (I am most definitely Team Edward). And I really want to see the new one in the theater...but I can't find anyone to see it with.

I'm new to the area and haven't met too many people yet. Of the friends I do have, and the women either despise Twilight or think that I'm pandering to their interests to get laid. And it's actually slightly less embarrassing to let them think that than to insist that no, I do really like Twilight that much.

I'm almost resigned to just going by myself and wearing my shame for all to see, having awkward conversations with random strangers, seeing how many envelopes I can lick in an hour and then trying to break that record, etc.). If you like Twilight, great. If you're Team Jacob, even better (we can argue about it!). If you don't like Twilight and just want to come to make fun of it/me, that's cool too.

Anyone who reads this, you could possibly help me find someone. Sex as a whole is sometimes very taboo, but talking about sex is less taboo than it used to be, fortunately. I'm looking for a sexual experience, and I'm comfortable saying that directly.

1368517066.0,1eawpi,23 [M4R] Chicago - Girly Guy Grabbing Your Attention,Dysnomi,27,7,1,"I'm 6'2""

I'm a submissive. I'm messy, mouthy, and flagrant. I want a farm and kids someday, but I need a strong, sharp, inspiring, meticulous, organize

I'm intelligent enough to see the big picture (usually), social history, etc., with half a liberal arts education and the mind and spirit of an artistan farmer. I enjoy the finer luxuries in life, but I believe in sustainable, low-impact living in all situations for which it is appropriate.

I strive to eat well and excercise and it has done my figure favors. I appreciate the same efforts in other people. I like playing sports like basketball and soccer. I also enjoy rock-climbing, yoga, dancing, sailing, kayaking, swimming, and light workouts.

I love crossdressing. I love feminine dresses, bras and garters. I love the feeling of a string between my cheeks. I love wearing the highest heels I can, and being taller than tall! I love the makeup and the lipstick and the mascara! I love looking pretty, sultry or radiant. I like messing with my hair and painting my nails. I hate shaving... but I love the look and feel of smooth skin!!!

My other big kink is bondage. I like being tied up

I'm not sharing pictures... yet... so you all will have to suffice that I am what I say I am.

I'm attracted to kind, honest, thoughtful people that are as easy-going as I am! 

Surprise me... ;-)

I never have a good hair day

I've tried my luck on okcupid, sweet, a little weird, someone who loves to cuddle. As an artist myself I tend to fall for the artist type men. I'm not high maintenance and I smile easily. I love the smell of fall weather and cinnamon pinecones. I like to drown out the world with loud music. 

I've done fwb's for a long time and I am really longing for the emotional connection as long with the physical connection too. I hoping for a long term relationship and maybe you're on here.

                &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I am a world traveler, new people, colors, strangeness, scenery which is weird to say because I am an amateur sculptor and all my art is kind of bland as hell.

           &gt;&gt;&gt; In my spare time I love hiking and getting out into nature especially if its with good friends, don't I &lt;3 cats too :P I play basketball and I like exploring just about anything. If you have an awesome hobby I bet I would like it. (excluding underwater basketweaving.) I love books, old and new, If you like ancient history I am your guy, Neil Gainman is a good freind my favorite author. I love movies too and video games.

        &gt;&gt;My favorite color is Turqoise. my favorite animal is a Mongolian duck. lets see other important things.....I feel like I am forgetting something

    &gt;I do IT stuff that often resembles manual labor

I like nerdy, openminded guys  (or maybe the right girl, though I've never dated a girl before). Honesty and openness are critical for me. I'm not great with traditional gender roles (I'm a total tomboy), and I want someone who accepts me and doesn't try to make me into a ""princess"" or something that I am not. I'm looking for someone who challenges me intellectually (without being arrogant) and supports me emotionally (without being codependent) and wants a  trusty partner to do the same. If that sounds like you send me a PM and let's get to know each other. ",,False,,False,t3_15v5ua

It's the day of new year's eve

If you're a nice guy, and would like to roleplay online that we are old friends/lovers and have plans tonight, then pm me and let's get our night started.

I'm looking for some fun, or maybe I'll tell you my deepest darkest secrets before the clock strikes twelve, who knows.
