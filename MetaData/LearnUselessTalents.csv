2. Stick your butt up in the air

3. Suck in your chest to make yourself look skinny

4. If you have a tight butthole

After lying in this position for a few seconds, or may not even make a sound. This air can be pushed back out--as a fart.

Congratulations! You can now fart on command! Use your new talent to get laid, either, so fart away!

1352136588.0,12ochy,How To Perform Circular Breathing,squarebase,1043,200,74,"I saw someone post about this in the request thread

In order to perform circular breathing you must first understand what you are doing. Circular breathing is performed by pushing out the air stored in your cheeks while simultaneously breathing in through your nose, will send a constant uninterrupted stream of air through your mouth. It is simple but takes practice.

You may want to harvest this talent for an instrument but begin practicing using only your mouth. 

**Make sure your mouth isn't open too wide.** Remember

1. Begin by exhaling as you normally would. Don't exhale too slowly or too quickly. As you are exhaling

2. As the air in your lungs starts to run out, I do not know the correct way to phrase this...if this is confusing, think about how your tongue is positioned in your mouth when you blow your nose, or when you try to sniff something. The back of your tongue should be up against the back part of the roof of your mouth). 

3. Once opening the pathway to your nose, this shouldn't be too hard. If done correctly, the transition between exhaling with the lungs and exhaling with the air in your mouth should be seamless. **Note:** this step takes practice. The time that you have to inhale through the nose is limited, since there is only a certain amount of air stored in the cheeks. Practice adjusting the flow rate of air to help give you some extra inhaling time (ie slightly tightening the mouth opening as to decrease the amount of air needed to keep the same flow rate, therefore conserving the air a bit more).

4. This is the most difficult step in my opinion, exhale so that the air in your lungs enters your mouth from the back, ""meeting up"" with what little remaining air you still have stored in your mouth and therefore replenishing the air in your mouth. Now your airflow will continue, using the air in your lungs, as it originally was. You are now back to step 1 so remember to store some of this air in your mouth again. 

This final step is difficult because the transition must

Once you have mastered steps 1-4

Just something to note: the only air that flows through the nasal passage is air that you are **inhaling**

Hope this helps some people!

1345605778.0,ym9xe,How to figure out a day of the week for a given date,zobront,559,89,51,"For some reason this trick is often considered an autistic superpower

The memorization is the hard part.

Each month has a value:

January - 3

February - 6

March - 6

April - 2

May - 4

June - 0

July - 2

August - 5

September - 1

October - 3

November - 6

December - 1



Each century has a value:

1700s - 2

1800s - 0

1900s - 5

2000s - 4

2100s - 2



Now for the calculation. We'll use the example May 23

1) Take the last two digits of the year (ex. 90)

2) Divide the number by 4

3) Add the century value to the running total (ex. 112 + 5 = 117)

4) Add the month value to the running total (ex. 117 + 4 = 121)

5) Add the date to the current value (ex. 121 + 23 = 144)

6) Take the result

7) Use the remainder to find the day of the week:


Sunday - 1

Monday - 2

Tuesday - 3

Wednesday - 4

Thursday - 5

Friday - 6

Saturday - 0

1353469534.0,13jqo5,My guide to lucid dreaming,RothKyle,333,40,145,"First of all

Secondly, within a dream, and you actually come to the realization that you aren't awake, allowing you to control ""reality"" and the things going on around you, not to mention the ability to do whatever the fuck you want because there are no consequences. It is not easy. It is VERY difficult and takes a long time to master. 

I have been lucid dreaming since I was in Jr. High (Grade 6-8). I've gotten so good at it that I don't even need to try anymore. Here are some things that I want to put extra emphasis on before I begin with tips on how to lucid dream.

1) When you first start lucid dreaming, I think).

When you lucid dream, you will wake up, feel a huge weight on your chest, you won't be able to move or talk, but you WILL be awake. Your brain simply won't realize it. You will begin to panic, even though you may know exactly what is going on. You will hallucinate very VERY strange things. Scary things. You have to accept that this may happen if you attempt to lucid dream. If you want to know more about what happens in sleep paralysis, let me know.

2) Lucid dreaming does not happen over night. It takes weeks
Now, but...minus all the killing and secret agent confusion shit...unless that's what you want to dream about.

**HERE ARE THE TIPS ON HOW TO LUCID DREAM.**

1) Keep a dream journal. Every morning, write EVERYTHING. Did you recognize your location? Were there any familiar faces? Did you feel any emotions within your dream? Any pain? Anguish? Happiness? What were the events that took place? Why did they happen? How did they happen? How long do you think the dream was? etc. etc. etc.

2) This one takes a lot more committment, though.) Using a sharpie, draw two small dots on the back of each of your hands. Throughout the day, start picking out ""markers"". These markers can be anything you want, but I will just share what I did. Every time I looked at the clock, I would check the dots on my hands. Every time I heard the word, ""Umm.., I checked the dots on my hands. Just pick things that you know will happen frequently.

Here is what you do.

Say you decide to do it after you check the time. You look up, it will say 12:30 PM or maybe 12:31 PM. Normal, right? Well, doing this enough will make it engrained in your memory. It will become something that you naturally do, without even thinking about it. 

Eventually, as often as it takes). When you check the time in your dream and it says 12:30 PM. You will check the dots, thinking you are in real life. When you look back up at the clock, it will be different. It might have a completely different time, it might have numbers that don't exist, the clock might not even be there. This will allow you to know you are asleep. If you do this every time you meet a new person, looking back up at them, or they will be an animal...or something. Who knows.

3) When falling asleep

**DO. NOT. MOVE.**

After about five minutes of this, you will become very cold and all of a sudden need a blanket, etc. IGNORE THESE IMPULSES. It is really damn hard, but ignore them.

Ignoring them for about ten minutes will result in your brain ""shutting down"". You will suddenly feel a huge weight on your chest. You will hear things scattering around the room. You will see things. You have entered sleep paralysis. KEEP YOUR EYES SHUT. You do not want to open them. ~~It won't ""wake you up"", you will still feel the bed around you. This will indicate you are, in fact, asleep.

Good luck! Let me know if you have any questions and I'll be more than willing to answer them. Obligatory /r/LucidDreaming shout out. It is a great subreddit with a fantastic community.

P.S - I'm too tired to proof read this. I apologize for any spelling errors or grammar mistakes. If something I said made absolutely no sense

**TL;DR -** Want to have sex with Jessica Alba? Got someone you hate and want him/her killed? Feel like robbing a bank? Wanna visit Japan but have no money? THEN COME TO REKALL.....I mean...uhh...learn to lucid dream. 

**EDIT - VERY IMPORTANT NOTE** - It was not my intention to frighten people with the sleep paralysis thing. Apparently

1370351286.0,1fndks,How to calculate the offset between Julian and Gregorian calendars as far back as 200 AD,gmsc,350,77,9,"To start, and all you need from the year 1983 is 19.

Using the variable *x* to refer to the century number

1) Calculate 3x

2) If 3x happens to be a multiple of 4

3) Divide by 4.

4) Subtract 2.

The number you now have is how many days need to be added to a Julian date in the given year to get the corresponding Gregorian date. Conversely

---

**Example 1:** Given the Julian date December 25, so we'll start from there.

1) 16 * 3 = 48

2) 48 is already a multiple of 4

3) 48 / 4 = 12

4) 12 - 2 = 10

So, the Julian date of December 25, 1642 is the same as the Gregorian date of January 4, 1643.

**Example 2:** Given the Julian date of June 4

1) 10 * 3 = 30

2) 30 is NOT a multiple of 4, in the next step.

3) 32 / 4 = 8

4) 8 - 2 = 6

6 is the number of days we need to add in the 1000s, 1013 Gregorian!

**Final example:** As I write this

1) 20 * 3 = 60

2) 60 is already a multiple of 4

3) 60 / 4 = 15

4) 15 - 2 = 13

13 days is the offset, and do 35 - 13 = 22) to get the Julian date of May 22nd, 2013.

With the above technique, you have to start working with negative adjustments, and there are further adjustments need to be made for BC dates.

---

One last important detail: EVERY year evenly divisible by 4 is a leap year in the Julian calendar. In the Gregorian calendar

So, 1900, 2000, and 2100 are all leap years.

All you need is something tennis ball sized, anything roughly that size and shape.

First hide your chosen object in your armpit as high up as it will go so that it's out of sight

Then get someone to feel your pulse on your wrist.

When they have your pulse tell them you are going to stop your pulse. For this, use a bigger/harder ball.

To restart your pulse simply relax your arm again.

For best results make facial expressions as if you are concentrating all your energy into stopping your pulse/say mysterious magic shit.

**[Useless Talent] - Getting Free Stickers**  
  
How I got into it: I bike a lot. And I have some cool equipment. But, jackets etc... I was in the ""Whoah, Wtf!? I wouldn't even know where to buy stickers like that!"" category for a while. Then I found this url.  
  
http://www.bckcntry.com/?p=26  
  
If you send companies a nice note *with a Self Addressed Stamped Envelope, so it's a good way to spice up some bland spots on laptops and equipment (and wherever).
  
To show you how this is done and give you an example: here's what I did my first batch of outgoing mail.
  
This is my first attempt:  
  
**Step 1: Research**
  
Since most of the companies listed in the link are *snowboarding* companies
  
http://imgur.com/c6IKJ  

Some of them I picked just for kicks to see what would happen. I used some snowboarding companies that he used because I know that they would probably respond. Most of the rest of them had to do with the fact that they were major biking companies.  
  
**Step 2: Creating Envelopes**  
  
http://imgur.com/UOIIB
  
Now I noticed that at the original source there were all sorts of questions as to ""How many stamps?""
  
For now, then make sure that you stamp all of them. One stamp per envelope is fine.  
  
Now do all of those steps for your second set of envelopes
  
**Step Three: The Message**  
  
Now the point is to get stickers. Don't get too fancy. A simple message like...:  
  
 “Hi (company your mailing)
I love your brand
could mail me some stickers so I can represent your stuff?
Keep up the great work!
-(Your Name)” [Original Source](http://www.bckcntry.com/?p=26)
  
...works fine. Feel free to personalize it, so sometimes I will throw something in: ""I would just draw your logo on stuff, but I'm a horrible artist and it might turn out so bad that it makes people go blind just by looking at it. Any help?""  
  
**Step Four: Seal the Deal**
  
Making sure you have all of the envelopes and messages with their matching company
  
**Step Five: Wait**
  
It can take up to a month and a half to get everything back. Depending on your proximity to the company

Here is a sample of my results.
  
http://imgur.com/9OBZn  

http://imgur.com/a/3AYUQ
  
**Step Six: Post Stickers**  
  
Well
  
**If you have done this before



**Tips:**  
  
*When writing to companies

*You can use yellow envelopes that are larger. Sometimes it gets you more/bigger stickers. Sometimes not. They still only need 1 forever stamp.

*Don't feel bad if you don't get 100% return. I got about 75% (and I haven't posted very much of what I've gotten). 

*Don't feel bad if you get lots of wrong addresses. I am constantly getting returns.

*If you want a return

*I would give out free stickers

1. Sit down
2. Take your left hand (opposite of the elbow you want to lick) and put your right elbow in an ""arm wresting"" position on top of said hand.
3. Tilt AND turn your head to the left. (Basically stretching the right side of your neck as much as possible)
4. Without unstretching your neck bring it down right next to your elbow.
5. You should be close enough to extend your tongue to lick it.

I might post a video as these instructions probably don't make sense to anyone.

Note: I do not have a ""long tongue."" I am not ""double-jointed"" or too flexible. My body is fairly normal in lengths. I am a firm believer that a majority of people can do this but just don't know how.

1347111944.0,zjzdx,"How to multiply two numbers such as 84 and 86, or 63 and 67, 234 and 236, etc.",thisnameisnttakenyet,45, this is what I consider a more general form of that trick. For this to work

1. be identical from the tens digit onward (i.e. 63 &amp; 67
2. their singles digit has to add up to 10 (i.e. for 63 and 67

The procedure is almost identical to squaring numbers ending with 5:

1. Take all the digits from the tens digit onwards--they should be the same for both numbers you are multiplying! (multiplying 63 and 67-----&gt;6

2. multiply with itself +1 (aka next larger consecutive number

3. add the product of the two singles digit to the end (234x236 would mean to add 4x6=24 at the end)

example: 234x236= 
1.23x24=552
2. 4x6=24
answer:55224

63x67
1. 6x7=42
2. 3x7=21
answer:4221

Basically it is exactly the same as squaring two numbers ending in 5. Realize that the 25 at the end is from 5x5, and if it's 3 and 7, then 21, and so on.

5. The upper and lower sections of the paper marked by the folds are roughly 1/7 of the area of the paper. You can now continue to divide the paper up using these. 

You can also only make one fold and use that to divide the whole piece of paper

1373661668.0,1i6erp,How to burp on command,sleepydash,102,41,32,"Ever felt like doing something weird like this? (Well

Method 1 (optimal):

1. ""Close"" both your nostrils and throat - that is to say

2. Suck in with your throat; if done correctly

3. Optionally, closing your throat while still ""inhaling"".

4. Probably the most obvious and easiest step if you've done the previous three correctly - burp.

Method 2:

1. Close your mouth; however

2. Push air ""out"" from your throat while keeping your mouth closed.

3. Yeah

Method 3:

1. Put your tongue on the roof of your mouth.

2. Push air ""out"" from your throat while keeping your tongue on the roof of your mouth.

3. You know what to do.

Method 4 (most common):

1. Close your mouth and prepare as if you were about to swallow a large bite of food.

2. Continue to imagine doing so

3. You really shouldn't need instructions on what to do now.

Method 5 (similar to method 1):

1. Keep your mouth open but nose and back of your throat closed - in other words

2. Suck in air; it's sorta hard to explain.

3. Close your mouth

Method 6 (the first one I discovered):

1. Lean back your neck

2. Instead of hearing the ""click"" in your ears

3. I seriously hope you're intelligent enough to know what to do.

If you can do these well enough then you can attempt to burp while talking.

Here's a video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRtd0cvAvEM

*  Find how much you would need to add or subtract to make this number a multiple of 10 (For 47
*  Add this one-digit number to one of the identical two-digit numbers you're multiplying

*  Take that single-digit number you found earlier

And that's it.  2209 is 47^2

Why does it work?

Basically the equation you're using for x^2 is (x+b)(x-b) + b^2 (where b is the single-digit number you found).

(x+b)(x-b) + b^2 = (x^2 + xb - xb -b^2) + b^2

It happens to everyone; you push the opening of your refill jug together with the soap dispenser's neck perfectly

The problem was that you squeezed the refill jug, pressure is increasing in the dispenser and decreasing in the jug.  And fluids don't like to flow from a low-pressure system to a high-pressure system, so the soap doesn't pour as quickly.  When you squeeze the dispenser, what it does is push air into the refill jug, equalizing the pressure.  And after you let go again, you'll find the soap is flowing quickly once more without leaking out the sides.

1346366593.0,z3q8u,How to apply a screen protector to a smart phone without creating little air bubbles.,,52,8,13,"I saw [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnUselessTalents/comments/ypu0s/request_how_to_apply_a_screen_protector_to_a/) by /u/movieman1214 and thought I could help. I have worked for a wireless carrier for about a year

The application process really depends on the brand of screen protector, however some people don't like any liquid getting near their expensive electronics, and I have found with certain brands (i.e. InvisibleShield) you might get some persistent residue underneath that doesn't go away, and which might distort the image on the screen. 

**Tips for both wet and dry applications**:

* **TAKE YOUR TIME**. This is not a process that should be rushed. Make sure you have at least 10 minutes of free time.

* Always spend at least 1 or 2 minutes cleaning the screen before application. I find the best way to do this is with the microfiber cloth that should have come with the protector, always apply to the cloth). 

* The absolute best time to apply a screen protector is right after you get the phone. If you can leave the protective layer that shipped with the phone on until the last minute, usually have text on them, and they will cover the in-call speaker and/or microphone, making calls difficult)

* A great way to get rid of any persistent dust on the screen is with a small loop of scotch tape. Wrap it around your fingers and lightly dab at the dust on the screen

* If possible, however, because moisture can get inside the device and cause liquid damage.

* If possible, it can make the protector shift or detach while it is still adhering to the screen. Be careful with cases in general, especially ones that wrap around the front of the device (i.e. Otterbox Commuter and Defender, Case-mate POP). I have had cases push on the edge of my screen protector, causing it to lift from the screen.

* Most air bubbles are caused by dust between the screen and protector

**For Wet Applications Only**:

* Turn off the device and remove the battery

* FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS ON THE PACKAGING. Most of the application process for different wet screen protectors is the same, **never spray the liquid directly on the device**, only on the screen protector. Some require you to spray the top and bottom of the protector, while some only need the bottom.

* Use a generous amount of spray. Too little will make it so that the protector won't glide on top of the screen

* As stated above, front camera, any buttons (especially the iPhone Home button) and any light sensors. 

* Once you have it lined up to your liking, a credit card or gift card with the microfiber cloth wrapped around it will work (Don't use the bare card, you risk scratching or scuffing the protector). The instructions will warn you to push the liquid away from buttons or the front speaker, which is a good tip, but don't worry too much about it, especially if you let it sit with the battery removed for a day. I like to start from the middle of the protector and push the liquid outwards. I find if you can do this while applying pressure with a fingertip in the middle, the protector will not shift. 

* Most manufacturers recommend keeping the battery out of the device for 24 to 48 hours after application

**For Dry Applications Only:**

* Extra time and care must be used when lining up the protector for dry applications

* Depending on the phone and/or the protector, and line it up. With this method, you have to be careful not to touch the adhesive, as you will get fingerprints and/or dust under the screen. The other way is to peel off one edge, bend the protective layer back, and line up and stick that edge on first. If it's lined up correctly, you can then slowly start peeling back the bottom layer, but I have made mistakes lining it up this way

* Once the protector is stuck to the screen

* Now is a good time to make sure there is no dust trapped under the screen. If there is, so use discretion. If the dust is near the corner or sides of the screen protector, you can lightly peel off that edge, without touching the adhesive. Take another loop of tape, and lightly dab at the dust (it will most likely be attached to the protector, not the screen). Be very careful while doing this, as it is possible to get more dust under the protector. Once the dust is gone

* Once the bubbles are all gone, then place a finger on the exposed corner of the protector and apply pressure while peeling the top layer off. If any bubbles are left over after the top layer is removed, don't use the squeegee directly on the protector. Lightly place the top layer over the bubble and use the squeegee to push out the bubble. 

Personally, I would recommend staying away from InvisibleShield, as they tend to get a yellow-ish tinge over time, and most of the ones I have applied had residue trapped inside, as I mentioned above (I haven't tried the new [InvisibleShield HD](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dtAU7TWPjo&amp;feature=player_embedded) protectors yet, so I'm not sure if they are any different).

If this still seems overwhelming, as they charge only an extra $5 to apply a screen-only protector, and $10 for a full-body protector. They are also very high quality. Don't be afraid to ask the salesperson at BestBuy or wireless carrier stores, but don't be a dick about it and expect them to. Some people I work with refuse to put them on for fear of making mistakes, but I am always willing to help out. A surprising amount of people don't ask, but I usually offer to anyways. One of my biggest pet peeves is when someone buys one from me, refuses my help to put it on, and then expect me to give them a discount on a new one.

If you get good at applying them and a friend asks you to do it

How to spin a pencil!

Firstly, or even rulers!)

You use your thumb
  
The index finger is only there to hold the pencil in place.


Start near the very end of pencil. Just before the metally-eraser-holder part. [Like so](http://imgur.com/bQrGA)

Start learning to do this **slowly** and push the middle finger inwards towards the bottom of the thumb and point the index finger outwards to get it out of the way. You're middle finger stays in the position that it was in when you were holding the pencil. Because of this


It should spin around your thumb and fall back into place. [Like so](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6901VCPQ_s)

When you catch it

If you get really good

Good luck!

When looking at this

You should also note that there are no half steps in between B-C and E-F.  This is because, not whole steps.  If you play them on any instrument, you’ll hear that they’re half steps.  Natural half steps can be seen [on the piano where there are no black keys in between the white ones.](http://www.google.com/imgres?num=10&amp;hl=en&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=667&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbnid=OT26yjOx4XBQNM:&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.ukuleletricks.com/ukulele-scales-explained-for-beginners/&amp;docid=7VH4CnPSSoAtCM&amp;imgurl=http://www.ukuleletricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/c-major-scale-piano.jpg&amp;w=362&amp;h=258&amp;ei=xgeTUOrHGYTq8gTc5oHQDw&amp;zoom=1&amp;iact=hc&amp;vpx=430&amp;vpy=157&amp;dur=1336&amp;hovh=189&amp;hovw=266&amp;tx=117&amp;ty=86&amp;sig=105267377915843700322&amp;page=1&amp;tbnh=140&amp;tbnw=179&amp;start=0&amp;ndsp=20&amp;ved=1t:429,i:74)  

Now let’s go ahead and define whole steps and half steps

A half step is one step along the list of notes above (for example: F to F# is a half step).  
A whole step is two steps along the list of notes above (A to B).  

Now let’s talk scales.  How do we form major scales when we only know the beginning note?  This phrase will help you dearly: We Want Him With White Woolen Hats.  W. W. H. W. W. W. H.  
Each  letter represents a step – whole or half.  
Say we start with G.  A whole step up from G is A.  A whole step from A is B.  A half step from B is C.  We continue this cycle until we get back to G.  We get this list:
G A B C D E F# G.  Congratulations! You made your first scale!  You can apply the same rule to any starting note to form any scale.  

Now let’s talk chords.  A chord is a group of 4 notes that is composed of an octave and two harmonies.  The winning formula is 1-3-5-8.  Using a scale that we just wrote
Number the scale using G as 1.  Then write out separately the notes that are numbered 1, and 8.  You end up with G, B, D, G.  This is your chord!  Starting from A, you get A,C,A.

If you'd like to learn, he goes over pretty much all of the basics. Once you see his tutorials, you should have no problem going through more advanced ones, which are scattered throughout youtube. 
Learning through DVD's will probably get you a good jumpstart on cardistry, and many people argue that they are better. If you are searching for a beginner DVD, I would recommend [this](http://www.theory11.com/tricks/genesis-by-andrei-jikh.php). Most other DVD's are more advanced.

1344198051.0,xq7vc,How to convert decimal numbers to binary (and vice versa),mostafagalal,21,2,7,"So, the universe

The whole idea is to express the number you chose in powers of two, 42 would be written 2^5 + 2^3 + 2^1 , or 32 + 8 + 2 = 42. (Remember: always choose the biggest powers possible and then go downwards from there, or else it won't work.) Now, take the 2^*x* numbers, and change the twos to tens, so that they'd be:

10^5 + 10^3 + 10^1

Now all you have to do is find out the value of each of these numbers and add them up. That'd be 100000 + 1000 + 10 = 101010

...and that's it! 42 in binary is 101010. If you're ever stuck with a difference of one between your value and the desired one

Confirm your conversion results by checking with this [online converter.](http://acc6.its.brooklyn.cuny.edu/~gurwitz/core5/nav2tool.html)

So

* 1) Express decimal number in terms of sums of 2^x
* 2) Change the twos in 2^x to tens
* 3) Evaluate each 10^x term and add them together. If on paper

Have fun!

**EDIT:** So

Take a random binary number (i.e. made of ones and zeros only). Let's take 100101 for now.

* Step 1) Express the number in terms of powers of ten: 10^5 + 10^2 + 10^0 (which is really 100000 + 100 + 1)
* Step 2) Change the tens to twos
* Step 3) Evaluate the result. 2^5 + 2^2 + 2^0 = 32 + 4 + 1 = 37

Take the number you want to multiply and write it down.

eg   72618

Take the last number and write it underneath.  Then starting on the right...add each digit together with the one on the left and continue until you get to the first digit of the number. Then add the original first digit. Be sure to carry any '1s' over to the next digit.

    eg           7    2     6     1      8
                / \+/  \ +/  \ + / \ + /  \

I figured since I have seen some posts regarding how to get a nice signature that I

One could argue that writing in cursive is not useless but at least to me it is one of those things that are neat and cool but not truly useful.

I have looked at some online resources mainly for kids but then I never really got to learn how to make capital letters and some of the letters were kind of hard to get looking okay (I'm looking at you lowercase z!).

To just answer a few potential questions: Yes

Thanks for reading and I am looking forward to any contributions!",,t5_2u8qf,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnUselessTalents/comments/yx69w/request_semiuseful_learn_to_write_cursive/
1345735550.0,yp6ja,How to cornrow hair,Kimuraa,4,2,1,"This is my most cherished useless talent. At school I had friends paying me to do thier hair. I have no idea where I learned it

*First part the hair in half from forehead to neck, once you get good enough you can even just use your nails. Tie off one half in a pig tail.

*Now using the side you left down draw a line that runs parallel to your first line

*Make sure the hair is well brushed. Grab about a cm of hair from the front of the section and devide it up into three peices. I hold the two outside peices in my fist under teh pinkies then use my thumb and pointer finger to control the peice that is moving. Always move peices under the other towards the middle. To get the cornrow going I'll brain upwards 3 or 4 links. 

*After your starter links this is where you start to pick up hair. Make sure you have a firm grip on your outside peices, go under the middle strand that you're holding up and using your thumb and pointer finger grab a small amount (about half a cm) of loose hair while grabbing the hair held in the oposite hand. While doing this switch the old middle peice into the fist of the hair that you just grabbed from. 

*Continue this motion all the way down.

*Getting the first braid is the hardest part. Once you practise the motion above you'll be able to do it flawlessly. ",,t5_2u8qf,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnUselessTalents/comments/yp6ja/how_to_cornrow_hair/

Ok first make sure you have at least two people catch the person that's passing out. You don't want their limp body to slam on the floor.

Step 1. Get the person that's passing out to get on all fours

Step 2. This step, make sure to take one ultra long exhale.

Step 3. Hold your breath after the exhale and stand up

Step 4. While the one standing on the wall holds their breath and crosses their arms as instructed

Step 5. After about 5-15 seconds of pushing, etc. Now if you pushed on his chest, it's your responsibility to help him slowly down. Don't lay him down but instead set him on his bottom, back to wall. While doing this, lightly slap him.

Step 6. Within 5-15 seconds
