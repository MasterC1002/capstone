Thought it was weird, talking about how this clerk barely knew me did I realize that one of my first times in the new bank when the clerk joked about me seeming in a hurry that I had said something to the effect of ""I feel like the workweek beats you down, I know I'm always ready for a release. Besides, my Dungeon Master is always pissed if I'm late.""

1371642234.0,1gneag,Hilarious in hindsight...,Aetis,49,12,3,"The game started fairly normally.

Our party, Artificer, and a Abjurant Champion (I think?), ran into some fiendish wolves chasing down a tiefling girl. We fight them off, and eventually kill the demon lord wolf who is their leader. We cut his head off and pack him up hoping to sell his hide for good price in town.

Fast forward a bit, were resting in an inn, with our rogue/assassin keeping watch from a rooftop of a building across the road. Some guy climbs on to the rooftop next to our rogue, so our rogue stops him and decides to chat with him for a bit. He learned that someone paid the dude (he was a duskblade) gold to kill the girl and bring back her head. After bit of diplomacy and bribery, we convinced him to dupe his employer with a fake head. We disguised the wolf head (we still had it with us) with makeup &amp; illusions and sent him on his merry way.

At this point, we ran into the final boss room where we find a high-level cleric, the demon lord wolf again, the duskblade, and non-functioning shadesteel golem. We were confused because the cleric had mostly defense and stall spells prepared, and we were high enough level that the demon wolf wasn't much of a threat any more. The golem became functional after the cleric died, but we ganged up on it and took it down. tl dr: easy final boss.

At this point our DM, which was why he was sending minions to hunt the tiefling girl down. Apparently his plan was to cast resurrection on the girl's head to bring her back, then kill her with a special sword that can suck out souls. Imagine his surprise when he cast resurrection on the head, only to find his worthless wolf back instead of the girl. Also, the spells he prepared for that day made more sense if the golem had been active.

1348214172.0,108mtz,Tim the Rogue.,akigo57,42,8,4,"Several months ago I had the opportunity to partake in a game of Dungeons and Dragons

The game itself started out normally

There was Arihoni the Human Wizard, and myself, Art the Halfling Bard.

The game progressed nicely, and delighted in the comfort of legions of barmaids.

After a few weeks of play we were sure that we had attracted the attention of our BBEG (Big Bad Evil Guy)

After much debate our party decided that we would set our sights on the major city of the kingdom that we were in. It was there that the King of the land lived

During the next session

We wandered into the inn for food and rest...

I should pause here and explain that at this point in the game we had a new player in the group. We had played for about 2 hours before finally meeting his character.

Once inside the inn, and had a seat while discussing our next move. Art, being the good bard that he was, took it upon himself to search out anything interesting as far as gossip goes in this town. What luck! It turns out that there was a recent influx of Gnolls that had been ambushing travelers on the road... Their was a fair number of them and since there was no guard to speak of here, they had been stealing and stashing for months.

The resulting conversation with my party must have caught the ear of a nearby half-elf. The figure walked over to us boldly and introduced himself as Tim, partially because we needed a rogue, and partially because this was obviously the PC we had been waiting to meet all day.

Moving on... Tim was in a word, highly skilled in everything else. Every ounce of anything was dumped into skills and abilities that Tim found useful. He could pick a lock faster than the fighter could cut off a kobold's head, but that's not what made all of us fall in love with him.

Tim was RP heaven. Any chance he got, or any other 'trapped' something Tim would demand that all the other characters turn away while he did away worked his magic even if there wasn't a trap. Obviously taken from an unmentioned source. Beyond that though, he would run slight of hand checks to pocket extra coin from a chest. He would sweet talk anyone he could for that little something extra, and with all the skills to back him up he usually didn't fail. The most interesting thing though, Tim would pay huge sums of money to random Bards to sing praises of him. After a few weeks of heroic travels and wanderings we started to hear songs and myths of ""Tim the Savior"", ""Tim the Hero"", ""Mighty Tim"" and so forth. By the time we actually got to the major city

We wandered about the city for a few days. We aided the locals with some of their issues. I am pretty sure we had to collect bottles at one point (Nods at the DM). We finally did get around to trying to talk to the King. We made our way to the grand castle. Tim politely excused himself

We spoke with the guards of the castle and after jumping through a few hoops

""Yes my lord! Those men there

We were confused

The king stood and walked forward slowly. He let out a long sigh. ""So

We protested

Later in the evening while sitting in our cell a familiar face walked over to our cage. 

It was Tim. ""Well I must say

We screamed

""To be honest when I took this job I knew I wouldn't be able to kill you myself. I am not particularly good at killing others in the conventional way. So I figured I would let someone else do it for me.""

The last thing we heard of Tim was him laughing as he walked out of the dungeon.

The next day our characters were dragged out of their cells

We swore that we would never speak of what happened during those sessions,,False,self,t5_2qwdo,False,,True

When we can't run our usual Campaign for whatever reason

Essentially their goal is to abandon their posts as they know that as bad as the survivability rate for a Goblin marching with Hill Giants, it will drop much lower if they are still around when they clash with the forces of the Great and the Good. Every time a PC Goblin gets killed, the PC gets a new one right off the assembly line. If the PC Goblin manages to escape, he's still replaced by fresh meat, but this time the Goblin is a bit better than before. The players are well aware that their goblins are likely to die over and over again, hopefully hilariously.

I've stolen a bunch of ideas that my Google-fu has uncovered, ugly protagonists, whilst others might be achievable by accident.

As this campaign is essentially Filler for my group, so when we're playing the regular campaign we can focus on more serious roleplaying.

http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Decanter_of_Endless_Water

I found this item in a list of useful items.  Someone said it had many uses, I had to figure out exactly how well it would perform at this function.

So, that sounds like a lot, but it's the equivalent of flipping over a 5-gallon bucket of water (5 gallons per second). Not very impressive. In fact, in this mode, water is expelled at the extreme rate of 0.6 miles per hour! Wow! Er, yeah, it sucks. Not sure how a 20 foot long stream comes out at half a mile per hour

Now, which is rowed at 1.50 miles per hour, adding the decanter at geyser level lets you go 1.51 mph! Astounding. If you get lazy and let it push you without rowing? 0.17 mph. You would do better with the fountain level. Assuming the neck of the flask is 1 inch in diameter, that would net you 1.54 mph max, and double the velocity without rowing.

However, water will shoot out at 83 miles per hour! Now we're talking! The strength check makes sense in this case, as you will have to withstand ~160 pounds of force. As a motor, is it a lot better, letting you to 2.5 mph max, or 2 mph if you're lazy.

Go down to half an inch, and you have the perfect riot cannon. Townsfolk acting up? Fire a warning shot. They will be deaf now, but at least you didn't aim at them and strip the flesh from their bones.

So if you enjoy D&amp;D as a spectator sport, by all means join us at our YouTube channel.

**Who are you?**
	We are five very good friends who have been gaming together and independently for a very long time. This campaign is relatively new, a half-orc druid named Throg, a human wizard named Gage, and a human monk named Nerys. 

**What do you do?**
	We play D&amp;D and try to tell a compelling story, but occasionally we succeed. We play using the 3.5 ruleset, and our campaign is set on my homebrew world of Pryme.
	Every episode is roughly half an hour long. I cannot guarantee our discussions remain family-friendly, card games, and so forth. There's even a delightful discussion about shemales at one point. Something for everyone, I suppose. 
	While there is plenty of combat involved, and sharing a compelling story with each other and with you. As the DM, I enjoy creating a vibrant, living world for my players to explore, and as my players, they in turn enjoy ruining all my best laid schemes. The combination creates said compelling story, however

**When do you upload?**
	I try to upload every day, one can expect at least one and at most five episodes a week.

**Why should I care?**
	Because we're funny! We try to be, it doesn't work out well for you, but the resulting cavalcade of insults more than makes up for it.

The dragon was conversing pleasantly when my uncle decided it would be a good time to attack it with a lightning bolt... this naturally provoked the dragon, who clawed and bit my uncles wizard, now my uncle had excellent equipment but wizards aren't meant to take abuse so after the dragon's fist turn he was hurting badly, so my father's paladin healed him which put him on the dragon's shit list. My uncle during his next turn decided he'd bit off more than he could chew and attempted to teleport away leaving my father behind with a rather aggravated dragon, but he failed his concentration check, my father noticing his selfish action decided to act as any lawful good character would in this situation and he hurled his sword at my uncle... His vorpal sword that is. Naturally he rolled a 20, which in my opinion is more than he deserved.

TL;DR My dad's pally decapitated my uncles wizard for being a dick. ",self,t5_2qwdo,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/DungeonsAndDragons/comments/zrywm/care_to_share_stories_concerning_violence_against/

* First off
* Advantage is awesome. Just sayin'. It's realistic.

* Using STR, WIS, INT, and CHA saving throws, instead of pigeonholing your saves into just a few abilities is awesome. There are definite times where my character would use his Strength instead of ""Reflex""(which is simply stated as a ""physical"" save). A lock of swords comes to mind: roll a STR Save to hold your . Also consider a CHA save: there would be times where you have to be very persuasive or charming to get what you want. It's a good(new) system.

* Backgrounds make things very easy. 3.5 was OBNOXIOUS with all the paperwork and doling out of skill points. So much easier to say you're just good at a few things, adding a new skill. Cool!

* Death and dying is much easier and more straightforward than before. Both my buddy and I came to 0 HP

Fighter: 
* Very cool abilities right from the get-go. 

* Choosing a tree for defense or offense capabilities iiiiiiiiiiiiiis sick. Specializing your character and his abilities is something I really like to do

* I would definitely just like to choose one tree and be able to use any of those capabilities(death dealer or superior defense) at any time

* Parry is just a crappy version of Nimble Dodge. One idea I had to change Parry for the better(and differentER)was to say ""roll your expertise dice and subtract that number from the attacker's roll"". Yeah

* The Fighter's Martial Feats make it really seem like you're in an actual battle(Warning Shout is a good example. **""HEY DUDE LOOK OUT!""** is something I constantly say in battle.) instead of a boring clash of the dice.


Barbarian:
* The no pants(no armor) bonus is awesome

* Damage resistance description during Rage is unclear. I can see it getting unbalanced if it's a percentage. Maybe if you got a Rage DR die for every 4(or so) levels of Barb. or it could increase in die number

Lvl1-Minus 1 DAM

Lvl2-d2

Lvl3-d2+1

Lvl4-d4

Lvl5-d4+1

Lvl6-d6 and so on.

* Reckless attack is awesome

My buddy and I do have a suggestion for critical misses: 

* If a 1 is rolled on a melee attack, a crit miss may veer off course and hit an ally adjacent(5ft) to the target. Just a suggestion.

I had already read the small players book and dungeon masters book in the red box, then I started to read the full sized players handbook and realized there were quite a few rules discrepancies. I expected the starter set to be a bit limited in race and class choices, but the characters we built in the Red Box were far weaker than the characters/classes described in the big book. Now, while the Red Box is copyright 2011 the books I have are copyright 2008. They both say they are 4th edition, but does the time difference explain the differences?


What my friends and I did was quickly rebuild their characters (I'm DM) while they were still level one using the guidelines and powers described in the big book. I'm just really glad I realized the differences before they made it further than one encounter

Specific List of differences:

* stances were a big part of the Red Box fighter class

* Class features were all but ignored in the Red Box

* Many racial characteristics not described in Red Box (Except the Dwarven ones

* Some of the powers in the Red Box weren't in the Big book.

* The red box never mentions assisted dice rolls (Something that sounds like a huge help)

* The red box never describes some of the more useful combat actions (Grabbing

My friends and I (about 4-5 of us) are looking to get into some dungeons and dragons (emphasis on battle and general shenanigans since we want to have fun above all) but have NO IDEA where to start. We are general video gamers (console and pc) but have never played a table top rpg.

I've done some preliminary research online and this subreddit. I've narrowed us down to start with either:

Red Box - http://www.amazon.com/Dungeons-Dragons-Fantasy-Roleplaying-Game/dp/0786956291/ref=sr_sp-atf_title_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368539525&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=redbox+dungeons+and+dragons

or

Pathfinder - http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/products/beginnerbox

I can't tell the difference other than hardcore gamers prefer Pathfinder because you can play more campaigns in the long run than you could with the redbox. The issue is that I don't know how much we'll play but I want the best experience for all of us; if that means we need to start with something complicated to get the most out of the game

If I do get either starter kit

So reddit I ask you: which should I get?

First

1. You can have +1 LA without the adjustment

2. We max out HD, as everyone is decently optimized. 

3. He'll be starting

4. For stats, which with Racials comes to 18/16/19/13/12. The +1 at level 4, and every other one as well, will go into dex (except one to con for a bonus to health and fort).

Race: Goliath. This gives us a few awesome things: +4 str and +2 con

The reason I went for this guy is the lack of damage a dervish normally really gets

So! This is the current plan:

1. Swashbuckler 1: Weapon finesse
2. Swashbuckler 2: Grace +1 (reflex bonus)
3. Swashbuckler 3: Insightful strike (+int to dmg with light weapons)
4. Fighter 1: Mobility
5. Fighter 2: Weapon Focus (scimitar)
6. Dervish 1: Dervish dance 1/day, TWF
7. Dervish 2: Fast movement +5ft
8. Dervish 3: Spring attack
9. Dervish 4: Dance of death
10. Dervish 5: Fast movement +10 ft
11. Dervish 6: Improved reaction
12. Dervish 7: Elaborate parry, +1 dex
13. Dervish 8: Fast movement +15ft
14. Dervish 9: Tireless dance
15. Dervish 10: A thousand cuts
16. Tempest 1: Tempest defense +1
17. Tempest 2: Ambidexterity 1
18. Tempest 3: Tempest defense +2
19. Tempest 4: Ambidexterity 2
20. Tempest 5: Tempest defense +3

I'll be using, and add intelligence to both using insightful strike. The 1d8 versus 2d6 isn't a huge difference, especially when so much of the damage is coming from other sources (flay foe, dance, focus, intelligence, and strength)

Assuming I get his con to 20, though I'd try to shore up the will save. Assuming 22 dex and a mithal chain shirt, we're looking at 10+6+4+3+3=26 AC, without any other bonuses being applied (magical items, better dex bonus [enough to make armor pointless, or padded leather a better option], and combat expertise use). During a dervish dance, as spring attack lets you single out 1v1 opponents while an extremely high tumble and movement mastery makes tumbling past foes insanely easy to pass (you can just take 10, so I'd almost always get that +2 to AC as well.

With a high perform (dance) I'd be dancing for most if not all of an encounter, lets me cover bigger distances than my fast movement would normally allow. Flay foe at 18 also gives an extra +1d6 on an opponent during each attack in the round, and assuming I'm fighting something big that I can attack for my full round, that means +13d6 if I hit every attack just on the bonus damage from A Thousand Cuts. All of these attacks, btw, are at -2 of my BAB, which is huge due to full BAB, weapon finesse

So What I need help with is this: am I making any major mistakes in this? Are there better feat choices? Are there any items that I HAVE to get (other than the standard fighter tax of +dex, does this seem playable?

I guess this sounds like quite the rant

My friend plays a Mechaniks in this game. It's a mage that attracts metal and uses it to throw grenades and create turrets and stuff. He was near another player when a werewolf-type creature jumped from the ceilling to attack another PC near him
So after much arguing I tell him he doesn't get the opportunity attack, Mike was whining about it again.

The most recent campaign I've been playing, a Warforged Cleric(NPC), and a human Rogue(PC). We were confused, angry, and my Rogue was hungover from the night before. None of us had ever met any of the other people before. No clue how any of us got in this room. As we're trying to backtrack ourselves, the wall at the far end of this dark room slides open. The blinding light from beyond that point is slightly eclipsed by a gigantic Oni Samurai(PC) who looks permanently grumpy. Most of us reach for weapons only to realize - yet again - that none of us have any of our possessions.

So this big guy gives us a short, but the Rogue is just asking how much he's getting paid. We're told that time is short and more information will be given if we can prove our worth on our first mission.

Wat.

So we meet Ares. Yes, Hephaestus, and to our mission briefer Hermes. They three *quickly* explain that we were chosen for the brotherhood for different reasons, blah blah.... oh and by the way if you try to run, that little necklace you're wearing will explode and decapitate you. Yeah. Also don't try to take it off, 'cause bad news there, too.

More wat. We're told that there is some weird Mage by the name of Bex in this small town, as he's been with the Brotherhood for a while.

Teleport outside the city

Fast forward a little bit. We find out that Bex is living in this old clock tower that is supposed to only be used for government services. He's there by the mayor's orders. Rogue bluffs his way to the top of the tower for ""hired watch"" and as he's on his way up sees that Bex is into necromancy.

Paladin gets pissed, 560lbs pure muscle. (Just under the minimum requirements for a ""Large"" character) The two guards at the entrance balk and jump clear of him then chase him in. The one guy, Steve, guarding the stairs (who was also sleeping) jumps up, shakes off his fatigue and fucking LAYS OUT THE ONI with ONE HIT. The Paladin and the Warforged are still making their way up to where the Samurai ran in, and the Rogue is halfway down the staircase. As the two other characters catch up with the guards inside and try to talk them down, ""Miracle-Strike"" Steve's brain suddenly clicks and he realizes the Rogue must be part of this. Cue Rogue flying through stairway door threshold and attempts to disarm Steve as he is closest. Steve sidesteps and throws another mighty blow and knocks the Rogue down to -6. W. T. F.

Paladin and Warforged Cleric melee for a bit and finally subdue Steve (not without him knocking out the Paladin once first, Rogue sprints for the book and tried to pick it up. It's a big ass book too. Well, it doesn't budge and it also sets off a burning-hands trap. Paladin takes some damage but he's okay. Rest of the party starts fighting off a few zombies and a skeleton in the room. The Rogue, realizing that picking up the book isn't going to happen, vaults over the pedestal and stabs Bex pretty squarely. Bex gets pissed and commands the zombies to attack me, he grabs the book, pulls out a scroll of teleport, Hermes brings us back to the Helepolis for a quick healing-over. They tracked Bex to another location and gear us up for transport again.

And then the session ended. Was a great start to what has been an awesome campaign. The DM acknowledged that it started out a bit railroady

Also, Warrior 1. No character sheet. Nothing like that. But because of his ""skill"" as far as the PCs saw, the Oni requested that a team be dispatched and Steve be recruited to the Brotherhood.

A group of peoples have come to settle the Isle of Elmalur, he latter comes to outlsaw all other gods.

Then attempts to bring this god inti the world to 'Cleanse it of it's sin'

Bad Parts: I'm not true undead so I don't get lifesense and my Fort save is reduced to base.  This also throws a wrench in a lot of my actual roleplaying since I won't really be able to go into towns (unless I completely cover up) or really interact with any NPCs.

I'm looking for some advice on fun new ways to use this to my advantage in combat and other situations (Our group is more combat-centric than RP)

I don't really recall what my SO had said about her lack of ability, but more like a desire and willingness to improve. I think the other is in the same boat.

I've got a couple techniques I've suggested or will suggest to them both:

* Know the world and it's story. The better they understand the setting, history, and stories.

* Write a character background. The better you know your character, is she quiet? Is she crazy like a Russian spy?

* I suppose I could suggest giving the character an accent

* I may remind them the philosophy of role playing games is that of collaborative story telling, or as if you were reading a story to someone else.

* I have to push my DM into personifying NPCs more

* Practice. Think of it like acting, imagine scenarios with dialogue and speak out, verbally, your character's participation.

I am writing the entire thousands of years long history to the game to such a level of precision that it would be on a similar level to a social studies textbook. Not only will I write the histories of Gods and empires, but those of individual cities and tribes to create the most detailed game imaginable. I am discarding all realms previously imagined for a game, and reimagining Gods and races from block one.

I am very far along in the current process

In the beginning

However, undead, demons and monsters declared war upon the light and magic. The dwarf gods then joined the good side, while the elven race's gods as well as the gods of the gnomes and halflings remained neutral.

However

The gods created their respective races and fought for many years. However, the human's gods and dragonborn deities defected to join the light.

End of the day however, while the angels and elementals were allowed to reside continually in the heavens. The remaining races were sent to the mortal plane, and lived down there.

1361837658.0,19849x,Thoughts on XP costs? (3.5),ProZar3000,11,3,25,"Hello [r/DungeonsAndDragons](http://www.reddit.com/r/DungeonsAndDragons/)!

I'm writing to you with some questions regarding XP costs for spells in 3.5. I happen to subscribe to party experience, I made a command decision to award XP universally, thus keeping everyone leveled together. (On a side note: I don't allow races with level adjustments). To reward individuals who contribute or act more, I would give prizes in the forms of gold/magic items.

Now, I have brought back one of these groups for an Epic Level campaign. These are all veterans of my DMing and DnD in general, and I felt confident we would be able to play some high level encounters.

On to the question: Do any of you have thoughts for an alternative to XP costs for high level spells like Wish? Previously

I realize I'm rambling
&gt;But ProZar3000

This is of course, the weakness of this argument lies in my priorities as a DM. Fundamentally, my #1 goal as a DM is for my players to have an enjoyable time. The problem with shifting XP for me is the imbalance of fun that comes with it. For instance, the sorcerer casts 3 wishes in one encounter, changing reality so that it is immediately overcome. The sorcerer hogs all of the ""fun"" of passing the encounter. Later that day, now out of powerful spells, another encounter occurs in which the other members of the party overcome it together, overall? Yes. But for me

Alrighty

**Cassandra** – *Mistress of Evil

**Deity** – Orcus

**Domains** – Evil

**Flaw** - Narcissistic Personality Disorder

**Armour** – ???

**Weapon** – ‘Wound’ (Crossbow)


""Cassandra, say it now… Practice, get ahead of the curve, for you will be screaming it the day I am with my beloved, the great and mighty Orcus. Trapped as he is, soon to be freed, together we will be."" 

Orcus doesn’t even know her, it is common for her narcissistic personality to make others withhold information, or even give misinformation to put her back in her place. Lacking humility and compassion, her quest is to be recognised by her love, Orcus, and join him forever in his fortress city, Naratyr, she emulates his hatred for all other creatures

Cassandra’s past is of no consequence to other mortals and shares nothing of her origin; she is fully focussed on her goal.
Cassandra is raven haired, or martial, power. It is a symbol of her faith and is carried at all times. Shunning the use of blades she has put all time into the use of her crossbow, Wound, which she uses with deadly accuracy.

 What happened was we found a secrete room in a moselum for dead heroes, however, being a worshiper of wee jas I didn't feel it right to take anything and I knew that the party would want everything so I bluffed with a 21 or something like that (my bluff is +7) him and another party member get a 12 and 8 something rather low for opposing roles so I pass. However he's instistant that I'm lying because out of game he knows whats in there. So we spend 10 minutes of him not letting me out till I finally say fuck it I'll ""pray"" even though wee jas doesn't really get prayed to. DM informs me that it's all grave robber stuff and the place is under wee jas I misinterpreted that as don't touch it so I just finally tell the party what I was doing because I was tired of sitting there arguing over a door(total of 20 or 30 minutes). Still not enough for him, but he decides to open the door and DM lets me know that I misinterpreted what he said so it's a shit storm for loot.

When we looked at the Pathfinder ruleset between myself and the original appointed DM

Since then, the experience has been getting worse.

The original DM went on to do mid-campaign research and start making characters out of [this clause.](http://www.d20srd.org/indexes/monstersAsRaces.htm) The DM had been okaying each character

The current DM has been writing his own story, he nerfed it a lot to ""stop our bitching"" but he still has very high stats (30+ in INT and Cha, 24 in 2 others, less in Wis). To him, his really high stats aren't a big deal. I, for one, know for a fact he is completely full of shit right now since standard PCs can only get as high as 26 just to start (4d6 rolls coming to all 6's plus racial)

On top of all of this, and it's getting out of hand.

The worst part about all of that, and the results have been less than acceptable. I've been bullied, ignored, or...I guess...filibustered into letting it all slide.

I plan on going to our session tomorrow

Of course

   I DID include a TL;DR

------------------------------------

This will be the first campaign I've ever DM-ed over, but a campaign. And not a quickly-planned campaign either, a seriously thought through set of linking dungeons that will stretch across multiple game sessions.
   Seriously

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a group of six high-level players, so I've paid attention to how they think so I could determine how best to work my campaign.
   One guy, and as a result, is way overpowered. He can do stuff that I've never seen done, like nuke an army of twelve orcs and kill all of them. With one hit.
   He doesn't leave much for the rest of us to do, but to neutralize magic use and focus on melee.

--------------------------------------------
**THE GAME PLAN**: 
The final boss is a half-fiend-half-dragon who has massed a group of half-elves, elves, and dwarves to target a nearby city, specifically, the magic users, specifically, the ones who use magic as a weapon. The boss (Whom I've decided to call Scarlett Johanson(Because absolutely no good reasons)) wants to be the ONLY attack magic user. SO, she's convinced all these groups to work together. 
   Because of this intent, and each is led by its own mini-boss, with the exception of the half-elves who are just the scouts outside the entrance. I made this campaign to be tough on ALL the characters, not JUST for this one guy, so each character has his/her own fighting style/thinking patterns directly opposed in one area or another, or by the literally dozens of traps laid through the whole map. 
The map is seriously huge. I was drawing out plans on graph paper, three times depending on how I think we're managing partway through the first. All enemy characters will almost all be prestige classed and have magic items, the most powerful of which will also have a curse on it, specifically against the person it's most suited to, undetectable until the situation arised where it's useful.
   There are traps ALL OVER, this is true for ALL of them, I'm NOT targeting the magic user. Well, not him SPECIFICALLY.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Any advice? 
    I feel like we definitely CAN do this, but I've never played something THIS in-depth and really want to try it.

Want to send a 'fuck-you' to an asshat half-fiend player

I'm hoping someone could help shed some light on the proper ways to play Shaman in 4e. I have a player at my table who rolled one and I've never DM'ed an adventure where I've had a Shaman as one of the PC's.

Here's what happened on the last get together: 

he casts his bear spirit and sends it towards these deadlock wights that were on the board. The only thing I could do is attack the spirit bear, then as a minor he just throws the bear right back out on the board again

Also I would have to shift my monsters away in order to not generate an opportunity attack, he called his spirit back with a minor and replaced him right back at the monsters again with another minor, then used his standard to attack.

I’m just trying to figure out if hes playing him wrong.. it sure seems game breaking because everything is geared for level 2 PC’s and I can't for the most part generate an 11 HP hit on one attack. And I don’t want to just drop a brute down just to kill this bear but I may have to so he starts thinking about how to play it.

And so to podcasting we have moved, the new home of the D&amp;D: Pryme actual play podcast.

If you’re brand new to us

We are five very good friends who have been gaming together and independently for a very long time. This campaign is relatively new, a half-orc druid named Throg, a human wizard named Gage, and a human monk named Nerys.

We play D&amp;D and try to tell a compelling story, but occasionally we succeed. We play using the 3.5 ruleset, and our campaign is set on my homebrew world of Pryme. Every episode is roughly half an hour long. I cannot guarantee our discussions remain family-friendly, nor can I guarantee that we are able to stay on topic at all times. Frequently we will divulge in discussion regarding other nerdy hobbies—tv shows, video games, card games, and so forth. There’s even a delightful discussion about shemales at one point. Something for everyone, first and foremost we are interested in crafting, living world for my players to explore, and I think the one we’re weaving is good enough to share.

We are dedicated role-players more interested in the story than in min-maxxing or bashing dungeon doors. We think that focusing on the narrative lends itself naturally to a storytelling setting

Now hopefully you will bear with me as I acclimate myself to the new site and the new format

**MONDAY:** D&amp;D: Pryme Actual Play podcast. The bread and butter of our operation. The current episodes are half hour long but eventually this will become hour-long installments of our ongoing campaign.

**TUESDAY:** The World of Pryme. This will be a weekly blog entry detailing the various places, the viewer, can better understand the world in which the players reside.

**WEDNESDAY:** Side Quests Podcast. Every Wednesday, from video games to television to card games to books. We will share our insight and ignorance with you.

**THURSDAY:** Loremasters of Pryme. Like The World of Pryme, religion, and arcane practices that the citizens of Pryme follow.

**FRIDAY:** The second D&amp;D: Pryme Actual Play podcast upload for the week.

1357623879.0,1663d1,Someone extremely new to D&amp;D with some concerns about being a dungeon master...,JonJern,6,1,7,"Hey

About two years ago, fairly fun, reminded me of KotoR in a sense, though I never finished the main campaign so I set it aside for awhile. At this point, I'm completely unfamiliar with DnD rules and concepts. Eventually, I realised there was a semi-active multiplayer community tucked in, so I played around there for awhile. I was server hopping for a couple of weeks on roleplay servers, having some fun and whatnot. Eventually

The players and admins were very understanding of the fact that I still know LITERALLY nothing about DnD, which they allowed me to. I wanted to be a DM because while the rules of DnD do not interest me that much, I'd love to make a story within this setting (I'm a writer, I like doing it although I'm nothing much, haha).

Though I'm facing some very big concerns with DMing. The thought of all eyes and ears watching me craft out an elaborate story is terrifying and nerve-racking

My one big problem is, ""Why would they bother with me when there's dozens of other more qualified DM's (Mind you, I have completely zero experience DMing) ?"", which they quickly dismissed as being a baby. Dunno, maybe I was being a baby, I'm not just crazy on the whole ""making myself look like a fool"" thing.

One solution I could think of was having someone Co-DM for me. Now, but a co-DM can relieve a lot of the stress and worries I have of being a terrible DM. The other solution is to... Just forget about being a DM. Just continue on roleplaying. I don't know though, I feel like this is a good first step to familiarize myself with DnD, and it has to come one way sooner or later.

What do you suggest I do? I know this is a really stupid question and all, and sorry, in advance.

I'd rather not post the community's web page

(Also, haha.))

I just picked up the core books 4e + a bunch of assorted books for $50 from some guy on craigslist :-D  

I have a group who is interested

I've never DM'd before so any tips would be great.   

For an initial story here's what I've come up with so far.    

A pioneer town/colony has sent reports back to the kingdom of troubles.  The kingdom hires a group and sends them out to investigate and deal with the issues.   This explains how the group got together and I'll let each person come up with their own motivations for coming.   

The pioneer town is set out in a seemingly peaceful area that has been abandoned for many years.   The town is being built on the ruins of an old small town.    Strange things have been happening such as dissapearances

They eventually find out that this isn't the first colony here.  About 20 years ago the first pioneer group mysteriously disappeared.  

The original town (prior to the first colony) slaughtered a group of peaceful tribal people who lived nearby in the wilderness and their sole surviving shaman placed a curse on the land before dying.    They'll find clues to this and eventually piece it together

In the mean time they have to deal with the effects of the curse which steadily ramp up in power.  Starting out with diseased crops

In between weird curse things, finding lost livestock and such and many of those will lead to little adventures and random encounters.

Wizards of the Coast (WotC) are pouring almost all of their resources into the 5th Edition (5e or “D&amp;D Next”) and very little new material is being released for 4e.  

I found this site’s page: [A NOMENCLATURE OF D&amp;D EDITIONS](http://www.thealexandrian.net/creations/misc/edition-nomenclature.html) to be a valuable resource in understanding the editions. It’s very handy in that it also shows the published covers of the rulebooks so you know what to look for. 

**0e (Original D&amp;D)** is available at www.dndclassics.com in watermarked PDF format. It started with the [Basic Rules](http://www.dndclassics.com/product/110274/D%26D-Basic-Set-Rulebook-%28Basic%29), Companion, Masters and Immortals), a set of rules published to cover Level 1 and above. You can find of the rules for BECM in the [Rules Cyclopedia](http://www.dndclassics.com/product/17171/D%26D-Rules-Cyclopedia-%28Basic%29?it=1). However remember that they’re just the rules, with little information on how to play. (So if you’re new to the game you’ll at least need the full Basic rulebook and the Cyclopedia.) The fate of Immortals has yet to be decided...

**1e (Advanced D&amp;D)** was just recently reprinted as premium hardbacks, also known collectively as the “Core Books”. They’ve also been reprinted as premium hardbacks *Unearthed Arcana* and a series of adventure modules entitled *Against the Slave Lords*.

**2e (Advanced D&amp;D v2)** has also been recently reprinted as premium hardbacks

*NOTE:* The 2e MM is called *Monstrous Manual*. 

**3e (D&amp;D v3)** was released in 2000 and can be a bit hard to find as they haven’t yet been reprinted nor are they available in PDF format. 

*NOTE:* The 3e MM is now back to *Monster Manual*

**3.5e (D&amp;D v3.5)** was released in 2003 and premium reprints are available online by searching for “D&amp;D 3.5”. 

*CAUTION:* Amazon lists both “Premium Dungeons &amp; Dragons 3.5 Player’s Handbook with Errata by Wizards RPG Team (Sep 18, 2003)” so make sure to search carefully!

*NOTE:* It was at this point in time that Wizards of the Coast decided to release the core rules for D&amp;D 3.5 under the Open Game License. Auspiciously to allow for easier adventure module creation

**3.75e (Pathfinder)** was spawned by Paizo. The 3.5e (edition) rules are available free online at [Paizo PRD](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/) and at http://www.d20srd.org. 

*NOTE:* Paizo
&gt; “The *Pathfinder Roleplaying Game* is released under the Open Game License, and tables contains all of the open rules in the system, and is provided for the use of the community of gamers and publishers working with the system.

&gt; This compendium is NOT the official *Pathfinder Roleplaying Game*! Players interested in a user-friendly introduction to the Pathfinder system will want to purchase the complete *Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook* and the *Pathfinder RPG Bestiary*

**4.0e (D&amp;D v4.0)** was released by Wizards of the Coast in 2008 and represents a major reworking of the rules. This is the last released version of D&amp;D and you can find the Core Books (three volumes each for the PHB

2014 will mark the 40th anniversary of Dungeons &amp; Dragons and to that end WotC are reworking the rules with the noble goal of uniting *all* editions of D&amp;D by creating a core game that can then be modified by rules modules to allow any style (i.e. edition) of role playing your group desires. This [was announced](http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Article.aspx?x=dnd/4ll/20120109) in January of 2012. In January of 2013 WotC published these four articles: [D&amp;D Next Goals, Part Three](http://www.wizards.com/DnD/Article.aspx?x=dnd/4ll/20130122) and [D&amp;D Next Goals, Part Four](http://www.wizards.com/DnD/Article.aspx?x=dnd/4ll/20130128). 

**5e (D&amp;D Next)** is currently being publicly play tested and you can sign up for free at www.dndnext.com. Then download the PDF-based rules and test out the Next edition for yourself. (Including five adventure modules.) The R&amp;D team has publicly stated that the email survey you receive is the #1 form of feedback for them. So make sure to fill it out. WotC has stated that this is the largest public play test of any game in history. 

For more specific details on the differences between editions please see [Choosing an Edition](http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/wjio3/resource_guide_choosing_an_edition/) over at /r/dnd or you can also check out [Editions of Dungeons &amp; Dragons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editions_of_Dungeons_%26_Dragons) on Wikipedia.

Where I need help with is, with an occasional trap thrown in.  
The group is talked into hunting down an artifact by a higher level Fire Elemental who has Azer as his servants/workers. The group needs the Azer help to forge a special magical propertied weapon for further into the campaign. The Elemental explains that some renegade Azer stole his Decanter of Everlasting Water and he will do will perform their task for it's return. What he doesn't mention the renegade Azer now work for a young red dragon. He will eventually explain when they return with the decanter that he doesn't want his name going around when the mother dragon finds out one of her children was murdered. So they go to an old abandoned Volcano and work their way through it, or managed to retrieve it, but they don't hear the humanoid splashing and playing in his pool, to which they learn they are dealing with a dragon.   
2 things I am asking.   
Does like an interesting plot for quest of an adventure, splashing in his pool.   
2nd I kept thinking that the closer the group gets tunnelwise to the dragon, that might make the players a bit uncomfortable. How should I handle this? Maybe an endurance check like every 10 mins? I was also thinking some sort of speed reduction. Maybe -1 speed if they fail, and eventually when they are right up on the dragon, half speed movement if failed? Also should I just penalize the heavy armor wearing players or should I include the little halfling runt in a robe?

I'm playing a pathfinder/3.5 campaign with about 10 other guys. We meet about every week and it is really consistent. We have:
human bard
half elf ranger
changeling monk
halfling druid
dwarf fighter
gnome artificer
kahalstar wilder
warforged barbarian

Its an eberron campaign in which everyone in the group is a part of a secret organization called the distinguished. We are working for a shadowy group that is the secret service of one of the kings in the land. We've done shadow ops, delivering goods, etc. Pretty basic stuff really.

I'm just looking for suggestions to improve what I've got so far. I'm using the Pathfinder rule set but its basically just modified 3.5e.

The PCs are all playing weird classes. We've got a Samurai, Summoner/Wizard, and a Berzerker. They are lvl 5.

OK so here is my adventure idea:
The adventure takes place in a city. It's a coastal city that deals heavily in trade with the east (can explain many eastern style PCs and make equipment available to them.). The city has some trouble with pirates and has resorted to hiring Pathfinders(adventurers) to supplement the city guard. 
The PCs will make their way to the Pathfinder Guild and be presented with several contracts but the only one that stands out is one with a reward of 50

The item is something called the Black Heart Stone and the employer named Saremeth had it stolen from him. The PCs will meet Saremeth.
Saremeth is an Elven Vampir(half vampire) and he wants the stones powers of undeath to use in curing his vampirism. He will use magics to try to hide his Vampir side.

Saremeth has other matters to attend to so has no time to get the stone but has tracked it to a Halfling Rogue with a triangle tattoo around one eye named Thim Harferry.

Thim can be found in the Goblet Half Full Tavern but has sold the stone to an alchemist.

The alchemist is working with the Cult of Orcus(Demon lord of undead) in the town and using the stone to create undead. The stone allows the creation of substances that can turn any living thing undead.
 
The cult wants to use it to create a zombie hoard to overthrow the city and to turn a paladin named Gladen Borrows undead in honor of Orcus for the new year.

Ive created some variant zombies that are able to spread disease and some gas filled varieties. At some point the cult will raise the body of an embalmed saint of Pelor as a mummy and desecrate their church.
PCs will have to stop the zombie outbreaks

Ive also created a Human-hating Half-Orc Barbarian named Grusk who will try to steal the contract from the PCs or find the stone himself.

My problem with this is coming up with ideas for different varieties of enemies other than just humanoids. I guess I could have a magical zoo in town that the cultists target to make some weirdass undead shit.

1375839832.0,1juqzg,"Newer to D&amp;D and would love any help optimizing a Necro Sorcerer meant to primarily debuff, not just make minions [pathfinder] (warning: Huge walls of organized text pertaining to my character)",TastehWaffleZ,2,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/DungeonsAndDragons/comments/1juqzg/newer_to_dd_and_would_love_any_help_optimizing_a/

Here is the **setting**:



&gt;We are in a modern day alternate reality, and people are using the God's magic as power. A huge war was fought over whether to use the power of the Gods or not. Most of the world was destroyed by the war and a giant city exists where people now live. The city has around 60 layers, where the rich and powerful live at the top and the poor live in the bottom layers. Outside the city is a wasteland, torn apart by the war; filled with unstable magic that is constantly raging. Rumors are that there is powerful treasure deep inside the wasteland.



Some information about my character's **background**
&gt;I am a lawful evil human sorcerer. When I was growing up I lived in a large house with my wealthy family. I got bored of this spoiled lifestyle and began to look into necromancy because it was edgy and looked down upon. As I continued to dabble in necromancy, the God told me to gather some powerful adventurers with various skills and abilities to go on a quest to find a staff that would give the God more power so he could attempt to rule. I plan on having profession (cult leader) as my revenue, gaining the support of followers as the campaign progresses, but building enemies in the process. These enemies feel threatened by the fact that I want my God to gain more power and not be controlled by people.



Introductions aside

We rolled for **stats** and I got great rolls: 16, 16, 14, 16. I put the 14's into STR and WIS since I'm looking at a wildblooded Sanguine Sorcerer. I put the +2 human racial traits in CHA and CON, giving me 18 in both, and a 16 in DEX and INT

I took Human as a race to get extra feats and skills per level. I took the following **skills** (CS denoting a class skill):

* CS Bluff: 1
* Diplomacy: 4
* CS Intimidate: 4
* CS Knowledge (Arcana): 1
* CS Knowledge (Religion): 4
* Perception: 1
* CS Profession (Cult leader): 4
* Sense Motive: 3
* Survival: 1
* Use magical device: 1



I took the Sanguine bloodline because I like the free spells

   
   
   
   
For **spells** I took the following:

    Level 0: Resistance, Touch of Fatigue, Ghost Sound, Detect Magic.
    
    Level 1: Mage Armor, Cause Fear
    
    Level 2: Glitterdust (DM allowed me to use Reflex save instead of Will because Will makes literally 0 sense)


For my 3 **feats** I took:

* Improved initiative
 
* Spell Focus(Necromancy)
 
* Empowered Spell [Doesn't help me much right now


I have 8000 gold to spend

The **items** I bought are:

* Handy Haversack
 
* Haramaki for the 1 AC with 0 penalties
 
* Extend Rod Lesser (metamagic)
 
* Cloak of Resistance +2
 
* Eyes of the Eagle
 
* Headband of Alluring Charisma +2

* Everburning Torch
 
* Adventure gear: Chalk, Dagger, Flask, Gear maintenance kit.





I would love any and all feedback

My dad is involved with whatever animal the tribe ""herd"" consists of and is a general good-doer, and focused on her bladework, which has renown in the village.

*Normal: Your family’s ethical reputation matches their private ethics.

I can try getting some discussion going but they have decided that they don't want their characters to know each other beforehand

It's been about a year since I've played and I miss the game, with a multiclass feat and eventually ended up with having a telekinetic power that would let me carry so much weight at once, and a Mage's Hand (or something similar). Each thing would allow me to carry 'x' amount of lbs to a distance of 30 feet or so.

I asked my buddy, and I could move the swords 5 spaces a turn and they could be up to 5 or 6 spaces away from me (whatever the normal spell limit was). 

My buddy said sure. And, messed around and were given fairly good equipment for our levels. However, he would also send very tough enemies at us and we'd all often come very close to dying. We were powerful for our levels, but we still made the game challenging by facing difficult enemies.

I forget what level we were

The fighting was.. very sad. Our ""tank"" could barely take a few hits before falling, to the surprise of our DM, and I was the last one left. I was able to avoid getting hit too much thanks to feystep and, I believe I had another 5 space teleport power, as well.

My basic idea so far is for the players to have their souls removed from their bodies by a cult. The cult takes their bodies and places souls from the land of the dead inside. Meanwhile the players must go on the Journey Of The Soul

In the Aztec beliefs the soul must travel the 9 levels of the underworld before their souls find rest. It's a journey that takes 4 years. In my campaign I'm taking the 9 trials the soul must face for each land and am assigning an event to it.

The trials are
1. Cross a deep River

2. Pass between two mountains that have fused together

3. Climb an obsidian Mountain

4. Pass through an icy wind that cuts like a knife

5. Pass through a place where flags wave

6. Be pierced by arrows

7. Pass among wild beasts that eat human hearts

8. Pass over a narrow stone path

9. Reach the place where your soul finds rest

And these are the corresponding ideas

1. PCs arrive in the land of the dead. The city they are in is under an embargo but they can get passage with local drug boats. The only way they can get aboard is by taking out one of the gangs in the city
2. (Pass between two mountains that have fused together)
3. PCs find a man being attacked in the woods by wolves
4. The PCs are walking when a blizzard breaks out. They find there way to a cathedral built of ice. Here they find messages of a creature they thought was sent from the gods but turned out to bring destruction. It was sealed in the depths of the cathedral
5. (Pass through a place where flags wave)
6. (Be pierced by arrows)
7. PCs enter a small village surrounded by a forest. They are warned that no one survives the forest. Only one person has come back alive recently. He will begrudgingly take the PCs through but during the trip he will change into a monster and run towards the village where everyone is changing into the monsters. Only one man was known to have slayed the beasts and a statue of him is in the village center but it is actually the man who has been flesh to stoned
8. The PCs enter a stone temple and are told that it will be the last part of their journey. It will be the longest part(4 years) and they must go alone. They are sent down a misty stone path. Each year they encounter a single person from their life who will disown the player and fight them. Most likely ending with PCs fighting evil versions of themselves
9. The PCs make it to the inner sanctum of the god of death. Where they must confront him about their bodies and convince him to switch them back(Not quite sure how yet)
