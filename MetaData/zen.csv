Make strong judgments very quickly, or allow some gap in your stream of thought. Something might slip through the cracks uninterpreted, alerting you to the fact that what you perceive as reality is a web of judgment, discrimination, and conceptual thought, and that something else exists beneath it. So, being busy *could* help, if you're paying too much attention, that could very easily accidentally enlighten you. It's essential that you *think* something about it

1366797226.0,1d01ke,Karl Pilkington is a Zen Master. Discuss.,TinyZoro,91,15,61,"I've been formulating the idea that Karl is a Zen Fool. 

Some of his quotes are actually pretty amazing. I'll give some examples.

""Whether it's a potato or a nut

""What are those things in Gremlins called?""

""Suzanne read the paper while I played with a ladybird""

""If you live in a glass house

""People who live in a glass house have to answer the door""

""You won't get anything done by planning."" 

On chameleons - ""Stay green. Stay in the woods. Stay safe.""  

""A problem solved

""there was this guy

On Art ""Stop looking at the walls

""Does the brain control you or are you controlling the brain? I don't know if I'm in charge of mine."" 

(On Ricky asking him to do a diary next year)""No I wouldn't, February it's the same thing, it's the same routine"" 
""It's just easier to put stuff off once we've got this calendar
""Say if I was in charge and someone said that buildin' needs knockin' down

""They say it all started out with a big bang. But

Reminds me of this

&gt;""Moment to moment, innocence and trust""

http://www.osho.com/magazine/tarot/TarotCardNew.cfm?All=Yes&amp;Nr=57/

&gt;""Be a fool in the Taoist sense, and then go on dropping it. Go on cleaning your mind continuously; go on dying to the past so you remain in the present, herenow, as if just born, just a babe""

Thinking through this I realised I never really got ""Then you had better wash your bowl."". I only understood it to mean that the zen simplicity was knowing that after eating comes washing the bowl and by doing that you could stay in the moment. But I can see it can also mean having done something let go of it. Stay empty.

The thing about not Zen, but what can you build with it?  ""Not Zen"" is only interesting when people insist that they know what Zen is, if they have faith in a idea or a practice and claim that sort of thing is what is Zen.  Of course the people who insist that they know what Zen is aren't going to read a book called ""not Zen"".  Ha!  Now that's market research.

Q: If those teachings were meant for the dull-witted

A: If they are really men of high capacity, for what sort of Dharma could that be?

Q: But in this way everything would be eliminated.  There cannot be just nothing.

Jesus has somewhat of the same lesson to teach saying not to resist evil but to  ""[turn the other cheek](http://bible.cc/matthew/5-39.htm)"".

Laozai got at a similar idea

    Stop thinking
    What difference between yes and no?
    What difference between success and failure?
    Must you value what others value
    avoid what others avoid?
    How ridiculous!

The point I am trying to make here is that there is no reason for the negativity

**Ask yourself**

The ""truth"" is true

Is someone else expressing their view an affront to you?

Is there a reason for harsh words to be traded here?

From the Dammapada:

    It is not new
    It has always been done from ancient times. 
    They blame one who is silent
    they blame one who speaks much
    they blame one who speaks little. 
    There is no one in this world who is not blamed.

All of say and do things that are ""incorrect"". Does being the one to get in someone's face about it gain you anything?

In levying these critiques

Why can't /r/zen be a friendly place where people can share their experience

Maybe I am simple or overly sensitive

**[Offender for a word](http://bible.cc/isaiah/29-21.htm)**

I haven't been in this sub for very long

    There is no one in this world who is not blamed.

For example

Some might point out an error in thinking that one can ""know"" anything about Zen. Or that there is anything to know.

Some might point out that in criticizing faultfinding

Some might ask why I'm wasting time [posting online](http://xkcd.com/386/) when I could just be sitting. (this is nearest my own sentiment)

Point is

Harmony probably does matter. I feel like we are trading that for the [lentil stew](http://bible.cc/genesis/25-34.htm) of proving a point

Some of us like to play with words in Zazen. Some of us like ""religious"" symbols. Some of us just want to sit in Shikantaza. Some of this conflicts. Rinzai types will tend to carry a bit of an attitude toward the perceived ""nothing doers"" and quietists will tend to think the koanists are missing the mark distracted in silly wordplay. The doctrinarians tend to be dismayed that both seem to have tossed out the Dharma. 

Get over it. Different strokes for different folks. I don't see how this community is the place to fight those battles. From what I can tell

**Some common grievances that lead to disharmony**

-*Ego accusations.* Most of us still harbor an active ego. Big whoop. You're not helping. Its the ego that gets pissed at the ego display in others. And then it cycles. Don't continue the cycle. As far as I can tell

-*Accusation of pretense, or wise*. Firstly, don't assume motive. Secondly, words are clumsy tools, sometimes you have to fuck around with them to say what you want. Sometimes all you can say is Mu. And yah, sometimes someone is just trying to sound like Laozai to sound all smart. Big deal, no skin off your nose. What do you or anyone else gain by straining at it?

-*Tough love, no one here is anyone elses master, or has been invited to verbally brutalize them or their viewpoint. Nor do most of us have anything close to the compassion or insight of a master. Extreme statements should be coming from extreme certainty. Most of us need to be cultivating great doubt right now, not certainty.

-*Aggressive reductionism.* We all have areas where we feel that others are adding needless bullshit. You could go around all day long saying ""Zen isn't that, word or symbol to configure the understanding to experiance simplicity. Why not share ideas and ""insights"" instead of go about looking for bits of carnality to pick off eachother's bones?

Each of you could probably add to this list. Most of us have done a few of these. Lets just not. I feel like this should be a place where people can ask questions without being told its dumb or pointless and people can share belief

**TL;DR ""True"" Zen**

If this community were any good

I feel like instead of civility and kindness

I tend to listen to Alan Watts or Anthony DeMello or any number of other ""spiritual"" audiobooks to relax myself

This morning as I was listening and drifting back toward sleep something he said made perfect sense.  He said something to the effect that our minds are troubleshooters, I'm just being alive.  That was a great realization that after I thought about it, I felt I always knew.  When I was my happiest in life I flowed from one thing to the next and never dwelled on anything really, and everything was okay, even when bad things happened, they passed and that was that.

So then when he went on to explain that we are not separate from anything, and the stars, and light and dark, it clicked.  It makes sense now.  If we stop trying to control, and analyze and change things, that peace that comes is what we really are.  We're it.  We're everything and everything is us.

Does anyone else feel this way?  Has anyone else not only understood but experienced this in their own life?  I really used to live this way when I was a young teenager and some how I got caught up in thought and finding everything to be wrong or trying to change things and struggling so hard to change things or myself.  I feel almost as if I've rediscovered a secret I hid from myself.

I'm working on the assumption that most of us are relatively immature in our practice, people latch on to and walk away with subtly wrong ideas).  I'd be a lot more comfortable with this subreddit if we could resist the temptation to

* make authoritative-sounding statements: Zen is X
* dispense spiritual advice: this **includes** IMHO things like “just sit” 

On the other hand

* sharing our personal experiences as students
* grappling publicly with the teachings we hear or texts we read
* posting interesting links
* handing out practical (easily testable) advice: things like zafus

If we are asked for advice

If we do absolutely want to bestow our understanding on the world, it could be helpful.

(I'm not optimistic that this would posting will affect people who are hell bent on handing out their Zen wisdom; but I'm hoping that it would bend the subreddit culture a bit and maybe make some like-minded folks a bit more aggressive in down-voting)

* … or for that matter on what your qualifications are.  I didn't mean this in a formal “you must have X level of Zen” way

* My remarks were more aimed at delivery than content. I'm not commenting on any particular content I feel is wrong
* How do we know we are in such a position? I don't know.  I have my personal prejudices whereby (for good or ill) I will place some amount of faith in institutions/communities/hierarchies
* No, or medical advice from a doctor.  I did indeed also mention hoping to maybe encourage like-minded people in the reddit problematic looking postings, but yes, can see that this is a bit fraught with danger in its own way.

1374239027.0,1immye,/r/zen 2013 census results,EricKow,46,5,9,"Hi all

I'd like to follow up on the the recent /r/zen 2013 census from a few weeks ago. We posted a [6 question survey][survey] from 23 June to 13 July

## Zennographics

We'll start with some basic demographic information. Assuming survey respondents are representative of the community as a whole, a handful of people under 15 (1%), and of the respondents one person 65 and older. Hello!

A small majority of us practise meditation in some form (60% of respondents)

For those of us who are in sanghas, but we also have 11% of practitioners in the Korean Seon and 6% (ie. 3 respondants) in the Chinese Chán traditions, and 2% (ie. one respondant) in the Vietnamese Thiền tradition. Note that these categories are not quite mutually exclusive, as 3 of our responsdants (6%) practise in two lineages simultaneously.

    Sōtō (25)         47%
    Rinzai (10)       19%
    Seon (6)          11%
    Sanbo Kyodan (4)   8%
    Chán (3)           6%
    OTHER (8)         15%

## Free-form text methodology

So that's it for the easy part of the survey! The rest of it becomes a bit fuzzier and draws into focus questions about good survey methodology.  Luckily this is really just an informal online poll, because it is an amateur poll, the results and their interpretation should be taken with a heaping mound of salt.

The two remaining questions were free-form text questions, and glean some bigger picture insights from the responses, I incrementally marked each response with a small set of codes (adjusting the codes as I went).  So if somebody said, that what made them interested in Zen was “Its minimalist, no nonsense path to truth.”, I marked it as “simplicity, truth”.  If they said “It's like Buddhism, koans are fun.”, and what pigeon holes you use can change the distribution of the answers quite a bit.  Hope I got this right!  This coding scheme later turned out to be too fine grained

## What makes you interested in Zen? ([word cloud](http://i.imgur.com/DQj3uY1.png))

Here's what I have for what brings people to Zen (percentages are among people who gave answers to this question):

    approach (29)                 15%
    peace/suffering  (27)         14%
    philosophy/media (27)         14%
    self-improvement (26)         14%
    buddhism/spirituality (19)    10%
    reality    (18)               10%
    life/background (16)           9%
    non-dual/suchness/
        mu/attachment/ego (16)     9%
    enlightenment (11)             6%
    present-moment    (8)          4%
    curiosity    (7)               4%
    koans/meditation (6)           3%
    related-arts (5)               3%

As you can see

Some initial thoughts might be that there's a good chunk of us who would like to find better ways of living through Zen, and also the 9% who came here because of something in their background (eg. personal difficulties).  Explicit spiritiuality or Buddhism only accounts for 10% of respondants, but you could also broaden the net to also include people who mentioned things about eg. peace/suffering, truth/reality, the present moment.  Interestingly only 14% of respondants seem to be in it for the intellectual side of things, the books, philosophy, etc.  Again

## How can we make /r/zen better?

Finally, we got these thoughts about where we should take things:

    status-quo (34)            27%
    behaviour (23)             18%
    content (21)               17%
    events/infrastructure (20) 16%
    participants (19)          15%
    moderation (11)             9%
    more-newbie-friendly (4)    3%
    
A good quarter of respondants either explicitly wanted things to stay the same, or “don't be so judgement of people who know nothing about Zen“).  A similar number of people (17%) wanted to see better/different content of some sort, eg. one who said “[I]'d like to see more discussion linking current events with historical lessons”.  And after that, 16% suggested either improvements to our infrastructure (eg. fleshing out the wiki), or more events.  Some 15% said something about participants, eg generally about wanting more people who “know what they're talking about”.  And yes, names were named, 9% of respondants called for more moderator action.  And last

## Till next year?

Phew

Thanks once more to those of you who took the time to fill out the survey and give us feedback on the community!  It's easy to forget the silent majority among us who mainly interact as lurkers

Cheers

* Approach refers means some perceived unique characteristic of Zen, etc, and is also lumped together with “simplicity” (quite a popular response in its own right).  
* Media refers to books, listen to, watch.  I felt it belonged with philosophy (which includes things like “new ideas, new ways of thinking about things) in the sense that both are things that appeal to us intellectually.  
* Self-improvement includes basically anything about the self
* Non-dual, attachment, ego were all individual codes which I felt I had a  hard time using consistently anyway (eg. what do you do with “looking up at the sky”? filed under suchness), and were similar in their appeal (indirectly or otherwise) to a Zen technical term. 
* Related arts refers to other disciplines that may have piqued the respondant's curiosity (eg. kendo).

So our first attempt at running the /r/zen Student to Student sessions fell on its face

Let’s try again. Our next volunteer is a nun in the Rinzai lineage (a little bit more about her below).  Not only that

## How this works

1. (You) reply to this post
2. We collect questions for 2 or 3 days
3. On 2 April, the top-voted one or one they find particularly interesting
4. By 7 April
5. We post and archive the answer.

## About our volunteer

* Name: Kushin
* Lineage: Rinzai Zen
* Length of Formal Practice: Since 1996
* Background: B.S. in math/physics
* Occupation: Hermit

Anything you'd like to pick Kushin's brain about? Now's your chance! This should be particularly interesting

----
**UPDATE** Let's focus our questions on Zen and Zen practice rather than the volunteer herself.  See [her disclaimer](http://www.reddit.com/r/zen/comments/1bd6d6/studenttostudent_event_kushins_disclaimer/) for more thoughts on this.

~~**UPDATE 2** A bit more background information from Kushin:~~

**UPDATE 3 (3 Apr)** Full disclaimer from Kushin follows (I previously copied over only the background info):

----

I honestly don't remember why past-me volunteered for this. It's not like me at all. For much of the last 3 years I've lived as a hermit with a couple of dogs. I started redditing 6 years ago and it's become my primary source of human interaction.

For many reasons, experiences, background and so on. I think it's interesting to do it this way in order to take advantage of the unusual opportunity reddit affords to have our comments judged only on the merit of their contents, free from bias generated by knowing someone has titles, degrees, or other credentials implying authority. This seems especially valuable when talking about Zen because from that perspective we are all absolutely equal in terms of our ability to have direct contact with reality and a man of no rank may be taken more seriously than a king.

This said, I will be immensely grateful and consider this event a great success.

Zen master Chao-Chou said “if a 7-year old boy knows more than I, please ask me questions about the Dharma. If, at the end of the answering period on April 7th, after exposure to my views on Zen, people still want to know about me and my spiritual journey, I'll do an AMA and keep this as my permanent username.

**This is all I'm going to say about myself:**

I was ordained a lay nun in the Rinzai lineage in 2006 after 4 years of residency at a Zen Center in N. America (and 10 yrs as a student) but I'm not a respectable member of the clergy and apologize in advance to anyone who feels ripped off. I was told to leave the Zen Center a bit less than a year after ordination because my teacher thought I was beginning to have too much trouble with the hierarchical nature of the situation. Even though I was very sincere and painfully earnest

I have a deep love for Zen

What drew me to Buddhism? I became a vegetarian quite soon in my adult life, with plenty of middle paths, forgiveness, tolerance and not harming others in it.

What pushed me from Buddhism to Zen? The religious aspects of Buddhism. Reincarnation, Heaven and not mentioning the abundance of ghosts. I can see where they come from (I live in a country with a rich folklore fiction too), but I like to keep my fantasy and beliefs separate.

Buddhism, I moved away from Zen.

Zen, do not care very much about the supernatural and the religious aspects that other Buddhist sects emphasize a bit more. However, as a cultural product of Asian philosophy, it has been influenced by other schools of thought too, most notably its strong anti-intellectual tendencies, which most likely came from Taoism.

Now, I did extra-curricular programs for high schoolers, and more. And I've been a student almost all of my life. And what do I liked both as a teacher and as a student? *Clarity.* The most important thing for a teacher is to explain the material clearly, consisely, without arrogance or smugness. And that is where in my opinion Zen fails tremendously.

That doesn't mean there is no teacher of Zen that tries hard to do this right; several come to mind. However, and I find it absurd.

And speaking frankly, what do they say? Usually, they do not refer to reasoning, they refer to either Holy Books or to God himself -- something beyond critical thinking, beyond arguments, something that cannot be disproved or touched (and is, according to them

It could very well be that at one point in history, I don't think we understand it that way. We think a ridiculous answer is good every time, because Zen must transcend the ordinary, thinking mind. Thirty pounds of flax! I smash you with a stick! ""This is not Zen! What is Zen? Kah!""

Do you think I doubt I'll get several such answers in the comments section? Not at all. It's the way you've grown to think about Zen, sleep when I'm tired, and I'll sit when I have time.

Synopsis:

A fifth-century Indian Buddhist monk

While others viewed Zen practice as a purification of the mind or a stage on the way to perfect enlightenment, to the movements of tigers and cranes, to a hollow reed floating across the Yangtze.

This bilingual edition, the ""Bloodstream Sermon"" exhorts students to seek the Buddha by seeing their own nature, the ""Wake-up Sermon"" defends his premise that the most essential method for reaching enlightenment is beholding the mind. The original Chinese text, presented on facing pages, is taken from a Ch'ing dynasty woodblock edition.

Imagine you have a glass of water with some sand in it. You put a spoon in the glass and you stir the water. What happens? The water becomes cloudy with the sand and things are unclear. This is what our daily life is. Doing things, being angry, being happy, being sad, being overjoyed, this is all stirring the water. And it doesn't matter if the grain of sand is filthy, or if it's shiny, or our love life

In sitting, or a beautiful thing, or a spiritual thing, or an everyday thing. Each grain of sand settles. They all settle and the water becomes clear. This is a clarity beyond happiness or sadness or calmness or anger. This clarity puts to rest questions of politics or religion or the human condition. This a clarity like the sky; it includes all but depends on nothing. This is just clarity of mind.

1347141768.0,zkoeo,My impression of western philosophy,,47,13,40,"For a long time reading philosophy has been a hobby of mine, and see what r/zen thinks.  As I said before, amateurish

If you read Plato, non-sensible ""world of forms/ideas"" and the chaotic, always changing ""world of appearance"" which confronts our senses day to day and moment to moment.  The world of appearance, which seems very real to us, is in fact just shadows cast by the world of forms.

Aristotle came soon after and had a different perspective.  For him there was only one world, its matter determines its potential.  So what makes a chair a chair is its shape, for example.  But that chair may, in the future, become firewood, because it is made of wood.

For this reason Aristotle says that matter is potentiality, would then be pure potentiality, and thus cannot actually exist.

Aristotle believed that there were four causal aspects to any change an object undergoes

Later Aquinas would amplify this idea.  At the end of the day, mere non-existent potentiality, is drawn toward God, whose existence is so pure and beautiful that it draws material beings into existence, causing them to take on shape and form as they move towards their final perfection.  

I for myself wonder what this could be--to be perfected is to no longer admit change

In any event, and we start wondering whether or not anything we experience is really real at all.  Eventually Immanuel Kant comes along and says that the form we see in the world we live in is all imposed by the mind.  It is the subject of consciousness which gives shape and form to the objects it experiences as a precondition for them to be experienced at all.  The ""thing in itself"" the world as it exists outside consciousness, is then necessarily formless and without shape.

Arthur Schopenhauer then comes along and says more or less this

The physical world that we experience is then simply the mind's representation of this inner will which in fact underlies all things

Of course, which is like a stormy sea.  Life is futile, and without any deeper purpose.  Your body and brain are just specs of form, representations of one little cresting wave of will.  Soon enough the wave crashes and the individual dissipates.

Assuming this to be the case, stop being the will.  Become merely a mirror, pure subject of consciousness, perhaps just a pure form representing nothing?  Of course you can't actually do this but you should try.

Nietzsche then comes along and essentially buys into Schopenhauer's metaphysics completely.  God was indeed already dead when Nietzsche came on the scene.  But, among other things.  So he chooses to embrace even this aspect of it.  Paradoxically, I think it was out of love that he embraced suffering and cruelty--he saw this as the only way to escape an otherwise inevitable nihilism and hatred for existence itself.

After Nietzsche western philosophy seems more or less to have slowly melted away.

Huang Po argues against specific Buddhist practices as well as Theravada

Huang Po is very specific at times

&gt; ""Were you now to practice keeping your minds motionless at all times, sitting, or lying; concentrating entirely upon the goal of no thought-creation, no duality, no reliance on others and no attachments; just allowing all things to take their course the whole day long, as though you were to ill to bother; unknown to the world; innocent of any urge to be known or unknown to others; with your minds like blocks of stone that mend no holes - then all the Dharmas would penetrate your understanding through and through.""

Huang Po emphasizes the sudden quality of Zen enlightenment

If you enjoyed Mumonkan or the Platform Sutra

1353088248.0,13b3xe,On the state of this subreddit,,37,7,72,"So -- maybe it’s just my confused projections and assumptions

I think it’s very interesting

The other day at work, it’s surprising. I had honestly forgotten that people even have it in them -- vindictiveness, mean-spiritedness, purposeful misunderstanding, and so on. An outburst of energy!

Now, together, are always sort of inventing what it is, shifting the definition, evolving a culture, and so on.

There are many “actors” in a subreddit, a stream of links and self-posts, upvotes and downvotes, CSS styling, etc. I’ve always found it interesting how these kinds of technological and cultural things shape conversations and behaviors.

There may be several people using one account, and everyone has a unique personality, everyone has different mind states, backgrounds, vocabularies, and -- perhaps most crucially -- intentions.

I’m just trying to set the scene here -- we’re talking about an actual online community, a monastery, or some other community.

For me, almost nobody talks about Zen or Buddhism in any kind of serious way. Mostly there’s joking around, smalltalk, and the occasional personal stuff. But you get the sense that people there, outside of actual formal practice and certain scheduled “Dharma Discussions,” have some aversion towards actually discussing Zen. This is “neither good nor bad” -- but it’s interesting.

The Korean Zen Master Seung Sahn had a koan-like question he liked to ask people. It’s this: suppose you’re in the Zen Center, and drops ashes on the statue of the Buddha. What do you do? He’s a strong person and somewhat well-versed in Zen to boot.

I think one interesting way to think about that question is to take it as a hypothetical -- actually imagine that it happens. What do you do? Does this reveal anything about your relationship to “Zen?” Does it make you feel anything in particular? And so on. The question can be used to investigate your own reactions, personality, and so on.

Now, that “Zen is not meditation,” “Zen doesn’t require meditation,” “Zen Masters warned against meditation,” “Zen is not about kindness,” and so on. Further, this person seems relatively well-versed in the Zen jargon and the history of Zen

How do you react? Why? What happens to you? How do you respond?

Looking at the reader counts and comparing to the number of people who actively talk and discuss

For me, old emotions, and whatever else. People change, people have different moods, I change and go through moods, and if I don’t do something to look beyond the conditioned patterns of understanding, I get caught up in stupid self-perpetuating stuff.

&amp;nbsp;

Since

Is unreal

Instead of holding onto things in

Your mind

&amp;nbsp;

Only original mind exists

In the past and in the future too

Instead of holding onto things in

Your mind

&amp;nbsp;

Having created

the demon mind yourself

When it torments you mercilessly

You're to blame and no one else

&amp;nbsp;

When you do wrong

our mind's the demon

There's no hell

To be found outside

&amp;nbsp;

Abominating hell

Longing for heaven

You make yourself suffer

In a joyful world

&amp;nbsp;

You think that good

Means hating what is bad

What's bad is

The hating mind itself

&amp;nbsp;

Fame

drinking

Once you've learned the Five Desires

They become

Your guide in life

&amp;nbsp;

Notions of what one should do

Never existed from the start

Fighting about what's right

That's the doing of the ""I""

&amp;nbsp;

When your study

Of Buddhism is through

You find

You haven't anything new

&amp;nbsp;

If you think the mind

That attains enlightenment

Is ""mine""

Your thoughts will wrestle

&amp;nbsp;

These days I'm not bothering about

Getting enlightenment all the time

And the result is

I wake up in the morning feeling fine!

&amp;nbsp;

Praying for salvation in the world to come

Praying for your own selfish ends

Is only piling on more and more

Self-centeredness and arrogance

&amp;nbsp;

Die — then live

Day and night within the world

Once you've done this

Hold the world right in your hand!

&amp;nbsp;

If you search for the Pure Land

Bent upon your own reward

You'll only find yourself

despised

By the Buddha after all!

&amp;nbsp;

People have no enemies

None at all right from the start

You create them all yourself

Fighting over right and wrong

&amp;nbsp;

Clear are the workings of cause

and effect

You become deluded

don't know

It's something that you've done yourself

That's what's called self-centeredness

&amp;nbsp;

Though the years may creep ahead

Mind itself can never age

This mind that's

Always just the same

&amp;nbsp;

Wonderful! Marvelous!

When you've searched

and found at last

The one who never will grow old

— ""I alone!""

&amp;nbsp;

The Pure Land

Where one communes at peace

Is here and now

Millions and millions of leagues away

&amp;nbsp;

When someone tosses you a tea bowl

— Catch it!

Catch it nimbly with soft cotton

With the cotton of your skillful mind!

Every Zen master that ever lived served their lives primarily as meditation teachers.  Sure, etc. but the masters we read so much about here had jobs.  And their job was to run a dojo or to assist in running a dojo and a dojo is historically a *meditation center*.  

There has never been a Zen master who was not deeply involved in the daily practice of meditation.  To say otherwise is frankly

When a master would say that meditation was pointless, with everybody else, at the dojo.  This is history... 

These guys provoked people into having deep realizations by pushing them hard to challenge everything

**EDIT: 
A simple test as to whether your favorite Zen master taught meditation:**

* Take a Zen master. Look him up in Wikipedia. 
* Where did he teach? If he taught
* What monasteries did he direct?  If he directed a monastery he taught meditation.
* Does his portrait have him in robes? If his portrait has him in robes - than he was a monk and he assisted in teaching meditation.


**A couple of basic facts about monastic life:**

* Monasteries were not taverns where dudes came and went while they engaged in Dharma combat.
* There were strict rules regarding every aspect of your life, women, etc.  
* Monasteries were strictly controlled by the Chinese and Japanese Feudal Lords.  They got donations and tax breaks and the right to beg in town.  
* Every Zen monastery has a strict schedule; all monks engaged in hard work

I was curious what people might be up to in a forum about this thing I spend a considerable amount of time on. I've enjoyed some of the links, but it's just all so toxic. I have to say that if I came here as someone new to zen I wouldn't be too enthusiastic about jumping in to practise with a community if I figured this is what would be waiting for me.

1360705083.0,18egny,State of /r/zen moderation 2013-02,EricKow,34,5,233,"Hi everybody

As you may be aware, I thought it wouldn't be very nice of me to hand things over as an implicit “now it's your problem!”   

So in the hopes of making some sort of stance, it would be useful to lay out where it currently stands.

## Goals of this Reddit

I think of /r/zen as having 3 goals

1. vitality: to be a lively place to discuss Zen from a diverse set of perspectives
2. quality: to have content which is interesting, etc
3. authenticity: to be faithful to authentic Zen tradition

One way or another

## Relaxed moderation…

You may have seen me use the ecosystem metaphor before, this “ecosystems” perspective is one that tends more towards the pragmatic than idealistic. In other words, I'm moderating towards a set of goals rather than an elevated set of ideals (eg. “freedom of spech”), and what I'm after is the overall health of the community.  Things that would be seen as potential damage to the community might be

- users being driven away
- people tending more to lurk than participate
- narrower or homogenous range of viewpoints
- generating lots and lots of drama or meta-talk

This attitude makes the moderation style rather light: I will tend to fairly laissez-faire about problematic behaviours that forum mods may generally frown upon (unpleasantness, tending to ignore them so long as I think the overall community is fairly robust.  I will sometimes intervene if I feel things are getting out of hand, but not because I think verbal abuse is inherently bad (or ax-grinding, etc), but because I start to feel the overall community is being damaged.  

Interventions themselves will tend to be soft. I'll most likely try to have a quiet word with the relevant party and see if we can come to a solution. The attitude is basically to try and address behaviours rather than people.  It doesn't mean the heavy artillery is off limits (bans

In any case, arguments based on practical issues or overall community health issues are more likely to receive sympathy than arguments based on what the other person has to say.  What is more likely to get a response is something like “so and so is shutting down the discussion by arguing incessantly with everybody until nobody can be bothered” than “so and so is being rude/arrogant/wrong about Zen”.  

## But with a little bias

So I've established my main priorities for the community as preserving its vitality/diversity and my prefered moderation style as being very minimalistic.  At the same time

Quality: I'd be a bit sad to see /r/zen descend to a stream of lovely Zen thoughts/pictures, only blocking outright spam.  If thing started to get out of hand, I might start to intervene a bit more (with a bit of advance notice and negotiating with the community, of course!).

Authenticity: We all have different ideas about what constitutes authentic Zen. Ewk for example would point at the Mumonkan and the Old Men; whereas I would be more likely to look at formal Zen practice in a traditional lineage. Yet somewhere I do think some things are likely to be more universally recognised as authentic than others… that we want more Dharma and less Dharma Burger. This has been a tricky one for me to sort out because I really don't want to establish myself as an arbitrer of Zen authenticity nor do I want to turn this into some kind of theocrary.  

## And an agenda

Basically, which is why I want to be careful to pursue this agenda in a fairly soft manner:  the use of lineage flair to increase the visibility of formal zen practice, (hopefully!) the introduction of the Student to Student Sessions (it turns out Zen monks are a fairly busy lot).  I've said before that I think of the moderation job as having four parts (sanitation, infrastructure, animation, and management); and the pursuit of this agenda is essentially through the infrastucture/animation side of things.

So that's my agenda, and want to take a principled stance that moderation should not be about pushing one understanding of Zen over another or stifling alternative points of view.  Softly softly.

## Future moderators

Finally, ideally from a broad range of lineages.  Will hopefully looking for people who may have compatible goals for this Reddit.  Not necessarily the same, mind you!  I'm sure future moderators will take things in a different direction, for example by opening to a wider pool of mods from the formal communities.  But one thing at a time.

----

**TL;DR**: 

1. vitality &gt; quality &gt; authenticity
2. moderators are not babysitters
3. Eric a bit biased towards formal Zen

i didn't get into zen buddhism because i was looking for anything specific. i'm a curious person and i like to know how things work. so when i stumbled upon meditation, jumped in.

i saw that despite how real something appears, or anything. if it exists, it exists. and if it doesn't, it doesn't. and that's it. there is no in-between. and that encouraged me to let go of whether it was bullshit or real or both or neither.

i experienced an intuitive nature to life. inherent nature exists in everything and it can't be measured. i learned that any measurement

i felt myself as a reflection of everything. that consciousness is a sum greater than it's parts. that the same could be said for anything. and when we follow it all back we find an unexplainable nothing. and that nothing is somehow everything.

i've learned that doesn't make sense. and that words are essential

It is what it is.  Everything going on before we speak about it

Thinking about it, is itself as much ""it"" as anything else.  But you can't point to what it is, because it is just what it is.  

Pointing to Zen is just pointing to Zen

You can't get any closer to what is through any method, you are drawing a circle around something and leaving other things out.  If you draw a circle around everything, you are omitting not-everything, which is something too.

It is like acknowledging there is nothing to do, because there is nothing to escape.  

At best, and pointing the wrong way, because it is the opposite of where I am pointing, outside of where I am pointing.  It includes where I am pointing, but that's about as good directions as pointing up in the air if someone asks you how to drive to Arkansas.

The best we can do is to just do what comes next.  But that will happen by itself anyhow.

I just noticed we've hit 10K subscribers in this reddit. Welcome to all the newcomers!

I think this may be the right time for us to start thinking about growing the moderator pool.  Right now there is only one active moderator (me)

Basically there are four jobs I can think of:

* Sanitation - monitor the mod queue and get rid of spam
* Infrastructure - improve technical bits of this reddit (mostly messing around with CSS and some light HTML)
* Animation - run regular events like the Koan of the Month and the Student to Student sessions
* Management - set and enforce policies that are conducive to community health

If you think you might be able to help out

* One thing I want, but I'd love the mod team to include say Rinzai folks or people with a Chan background.  
* I also want a sort of inclusive attitude
* While I value inclusiveness, I'd like long-time-ish practitioners (data point: me 5y sitting w group, so I'm not expecting more than that, nor am I expecting any ordination, etc)
* That said

It's a very rough picture I've painted above, do step up!

&gt; Our nature is the mind. And the mind is our nature. This nature is the same as the mind of all Buddhas. Buddhas of the past and future only transmit this mind. Beyond this mind there’s no Buddha anywhere. But deluded people don’t realize that their own mind is the Buddha. They keep searching outside. They never stop invoking Buddhas or worshipping Buddhas and wondering Where is the buddha? Don’t indulge in such illusions. Just know your mind. Beyond your mind there’s no other Buddha. The sutras say, there’s a Buddha."" Your mind is the Buddha. Don’t use a Buddha to worship a Buddha.
&gt;
Even if a Buddha or bodhisattva should suddenly appear before you, even if something unusual should appear. Don’t embrace it, and don’t fear it, and don’t doubt that your Mind is basically pure. Where could there be room for any such form? Also, at the appearance of spirits, demons, or divine conceive neither respect nor fear. Your mind is basically empty. All appearances are illusions. Don’t hold on to appearances. If you envision a Buddha, or a bodhisattva and conceive respect for them, ""All appearances are illusions."" They have no fixed existence
&gt;
But why shouldn’t we worship Buddhas and bodhisattvas?
&gt;
Devils and demons possess the power of manifestation. They can create the appearance of bodhisattvas in all sorts of guises. But they’re false. None of them are Buddhas. The Buddha is your own mind. Don’t misdirect your worship.

Buddha is Sanskrit for what you call aware, moving your hands and feet, its all your miraculously aware nature. And this nature is the mind. And the mind is the Buddha. And the Buddha is the path.

These next few are from a dialogue between a Hui-Chung (student of the Sixth) and one of his students

&gt;Q: The Buddha has wonderful ways and knows how to deliver all beings.  If he had no mind

&gt;A:  To have no mind means to deliver all beings.  If he sees any being who is to be delivered he has a mind

When we ask ""What is Zen?"" we are at least asking about what these old men taught

Suzuki complicates this way of thinking a great deal.  The dialogue above suggests that the Buddhist compassion which drives the intent to deliver all sentient beings is no-mind

&gt;A:""In no-mindedness there is no karma.""

&gt;A:""When I am hungry I eat

So that's where Bankei got it.

&gt;Q: The mind has no form.

&gt;A: If you already know that the mind has no form

This is a snippet where the Monk began with a question and ended up getting answers in the form of a question which he then tried to answer.  It is interesting in koans and dialogues where monks think they have answer and where they don't.  

Now on to **Chih**.

&gt;Monk: If Self-nature is pure, where does this seeing take place?

&gt;Chih of Yun-chu: There is a seeing

&gt;Monk: If there is nothing seen

&gt;Chih: In fact there is no trace of seeing.

&gt;Monk: In such a seeing

&gt;Chih: There is no seer

Well


Suzuki says that Ling-chiao argued in a dialogue that Hui-neng's [Sixth Patriarch] followers had already revised the T'an-ching [Platform Sutra].  That would be within two generations of the Sixth.  How long did physical copies last back then?  Did monks bring their copies from home only to be told

&gt;**Chien-nin** of Chen-chou was another disciple of Ma-tsu (Baso).  When meal time came, come and eat your rice!  He then clapped his hands a gave a hearty laugh.  This is said to have continued for twenty years.  

&gt;Later a monk asked Chan-ching, ""It looks as if he were singing praises.""  Still later, another monk asked Tai-kuag, ""When Chang-ching refers to giving praises, to who are the praises given?""  Tai-kuang stood up and danced.  Thereupon the monk made bows.  Kuang remarked, ""What is the meaning of your bows?""  It was the monk that this time stood up and danced.  Kuang said, ""O you ghost of a wild fox.""

This is perhaps the older of the two foxes.

&gt;**Pai-ling** one day met P'ang, ""Have you had the occasion to hold up to anyone the truth which you in olden days experience at Nan-yueh?""  P'ang replied, ""Yes, I have.""  Pai-ling, ""To whom?""  P'ang, pointing to himself, said, ""Even the praise of Manjusri and Subhuti fails to do justice to you.""  [Manjusri (Buddha of Wisdom)

&gt;**Hui-Laong** said

&gt;**Te-shan** gave a sermon in which he said, you give offence.""  A monk came forward and began to bow, whereupon the Master struck him.  The monk said, ""I have just begun my bowing, and why do you strike me?""  The Master answer him, ""If I wait for you to open your mouth, all will be over.""

&gt;**Pen-hsien:**
&gt; ""In the study of Buddhism it is not necessary to know much about those Zen interviews which have taken place before us, while standing, while sleeping or sitting, while talking or remaining silent, or while engaged in all kinds of your daily work.  When you have done this, see whose doctrine you are following, or what sutras you are studying.""

&gt;**Hui-neng**: ""As to not making your mind move towards anything, and is known as a perverting view.""

&gt; I just want to say hello
 
With this said
 
&gt; Why do you do Zazen in public places? Isn't this gimmicks and exhibitionism?

&gt; Traditionally

&gt; Long time practitioners that I know of don't go out of the way to educate others. I see that your behaviour is no different from evangelization or recruiting people in to Zen. Monks may give lectures or instruction to or share a tip or insight with strictly those people who have gathered of their own accord.
 
So why do I sit Zazen in public places? ‘znvfoa’ gives several reasons as to why it may not be good practice. I appreciate learning about it. For example
 
Yes, like ‘good’ or ‘bad’. But all of them exist within the business of being human.
 
Zazen is outside of the business of being human. The practice of Zazen initiates a meeting between the Buddha and the ‘me’. The human sits down for Zazen, no mystical or 'special' experiences, nothing left to exhibit or to hide.
 
Human beings come to Zazen. If they stay

I felt love for everyone

I no longer saw features and faces, the push and pull of the universe, the yin and the yang.

Life felt so beautiful. I felt so much love for all of creation. It's incorrect to say that ""I"" felt love. because there was no I. It simply was

But one year

carpet of pebbles--some small and some large--but pebbles and pebbles and more pebbles for
as far as you could walk in an hour.

One day
fellow of keen mind and observational powers
stones scattered so closely on the ground.  Now Ichabod was very much interested in the nature
of things
pebbles

He spent the night there
of enthusiasm.  He spent many days on his carpet of stones.

Eventually he noticed a very strange thing.  There were three rather large stones on the carpet
and they formed a triangle--almost (but not quite) equilateral.  He was amazed.  Looking further
he found four very white stones that were arranged in a lopsided square.  Then he saw that by
disregarding one white stone and thinking of that grey stone a foot over instead
square!  And if you chose this stone, and that one and that one
you have a pentagon as large as the triangle.  And here a small hexagon.  And there a square
partially inside of the hexagon.  And a decagon.  And two triangles inter-locked.  And a circle.
And a smaller circle within the circle. And a triangle within that which has a red stone
stone and a white stone.

Ichabod spent many hours finding many designs that became more and more complicated as his
powers of observation grew with practice.  Then he began to log his designs in a large leather
book; and as he counted designs and described them
continued to return.

He had begun his second ledger when a friend came by.  His friend was a poet and also
interested in the nature of things.

""My friend
universe.""  The poet hurried over to him

Ichabod showed him the carpet of stones... but the poet only laughed and said ""It's nothing but
scattered rocks!""

""But look
proceeded to show his friend the harvest of his many days study. When the poet saw the designs
he turned to the ledgers and by the time he was finished with these

He began to write poetry about the marvellous designs.  And as he wrote and contemplated he
became sure that the designs must mean something.  Such order and beauty is too monumental
to be senseless.  And the designs were there

The poet went back to the village and read his new poetry. And all who heard him went to the cliff
to see first hand the carpet of designs.  And all returned to the village to spread the word. Then
as the enthusiasm grew there developed a group of those who love beauty and nature
whom went to live right at the Designs themselves.  Together they wanted to see every design
that was there.

Some wrote ledger about just triangles.  Others described the circles.  Others concentrated on
red colored stones--and they happened to be the first to see designs springing from outside the
carpet.  They

""How blind we have been

The movement grew and grew and grew.  And all who could see the designs knew that they had
to have been put there by a Great Force. ""Nothing but a Great Force
""could create this immense beauty!""

""Yes
God.""

And that was the day that God was born.  And ever since then
infinite power and all men have loved Him for His infinite wisdom.

1270681624.0,bnvai,Just some thoughts I'd like to share,notknowing,27,4,9,"reposted from a thread in r/meditation:
____________________________________________________

There are a few notions that seem to get in the way of meditation practice. While I do not claim to be a Zen Master or to be enlightened

First

You think ""I am""- you think that you are your thoughts. This isn't the case. Your thinking is a sense, or sight.

When you walk down the street and you smell a terrible odor

A Zen master once told me, and so on, and said to you 'isn't this a beautiful house?' “

Meditation then, me, you, black, white, red, hurts, hungry

Like you said, but we should not be attached to this thinking. As Korzybski said, ""The map is not the territory."" In other words, can you wash yourself in the river on a map? Can you drink it when you are thirsty? This is like our thinking- we take it as real, but it is not.

Our ego identity is derived from this thinking

Descartes said, therefore what?""

Yet even by saying a lack of distinction, but rather you instantly feel that moment, without distinction.

All of this points toward one place- answering ""What am I?""

The answer- ""don't know.""

But this not knowing

And like others have said, annutarasamyaksambodhi, buddhamind, christnature, etc. You already have it. You just don't know it- because knowing is a distinction.

Think of your mind like a very very complicated calculator. When you pick it up each day

Again, nothing special.

There is a Mahayana Buddhist text called ""The Diamond Sutra"" that addresses all of this very clearly

I would also recommend watching a lecture given by Hyon Gak Sunim on this sutra: http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-8691172765637795347#

He explains Korean Buddhism (Zen) and the idea of living in the present moment very well. Also this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7OYwYyYT6s

Again, and as with meditation, the importance is what it is pointing to. Before thought. Before distinction. Before thought there is no me, there is no you. There is only the present moment.

You are not in the past. You are not in the future. When are you not in the present moment? When you are thinking.

But again- thinking/not thinking- this too is a distinction. It's why we meditate, breathe, etc. These things are good, but only as a guide. The Buddha often said his teaching is like a raft, and it too must be left behind upon crossing the divide.

This is basically what I understand of Zen Buddhism and meditation at this point. I hope it helps. And again

If you blink

My question

If teachings suggest we should ""accept"" the current state of things to achieve happiness, fear, and [all else](http://i.imgur.com/btUig2v.jpg), doesn't this mindset inherently ""accept"" the way the world is, the suffering within, the inequality, and all the other plights?

Sure, if those in the most suffering accepted Zen truly, perhaps this ""suffering"" would go away. 

But the entire world isn't going to accept Zen anytime soon

It is in this way that I ask -- is Zen cowardly? Cowardly for accepting the suffering around it

1362159002.0,19h0f5,The Importance of Satori Experiences in Zen,mujushinkyo,22,1,60,"Although the Chinese Zen literature is crowded with accounts of people getting satori, what is it about?

In the late 1960's there was a Rinzai monk named Zenkei Shibayama -- actually the head of the entire Rinzai order in Japan -- who came to America a few times, including *Zen Comments on the Mumonkan*. He was quite old and died in the mid 1970's, but his work to me looks like a ""road not taken"" for American Zen. Master Shunryu Suzuki and his students were far more effective a popularizing a Soto version of Zen, dismissing satori-experiences in favor of ""sitting"" together on zafus and ""breathing.""

Shibayama's writings are a really extreme contrast to Shunryu Suzuki's *Zen Mind

For example

""Master Mumon was first ordained as a Buddhist monk under Master Tenryu Ko and later moved to Master Getsurin Shikan. He studied very hard with the koan ""Has a Dog the Buddha Nature""? under Master Getsurin for six long years, who verified his satori. Finally he succeeded the Master.""

This is in some ways the most typical and ordinary of the satoris in the book. There are some stranger ones

""One day Hyakujo was walking with his teacher Baso. Seeing a wild goose flying in the sky, master,' replied Hyakujo. Baso asked, 'Where is it flying to?' Hyakujo replied, 'It is already gone.' There upon Baso clutched Hyakujo's nose and wrenched it. Hyakujuo cried out in pain. Baso demanded, 'Do you say it has flown away?' This at once awakened Hyakujo. Some years later, Hyakujo came to have a Zen interview with Baso, Baso uttered a great shout which completely crushed everything in Hyakujo

At one point

""Let me repeat: the ultimate aim of Zen is to accomplish a completely new personality by the satori experience, it is not Zen at all.""

&gt; 
&gt; I asked some Confucian scholars... one of them said that knotty problems like mine were something that Zen priests knew about.  Since I was still no closer to understanding bright virtue, so I was unable to find any Zen priests to question.
&gt; 
&gt; I decided that, I'd run off immediately and listen to it... But bright virtue remained beyond my grasp.
&gt; 
&gt; I finally succeeded in locating a Zen priest.  He told me if I wanted to understand bright virtue, did I lie down and rest.

If you subscribe to idea that there is nothing to attain

I'd like to ask the very question that monks have been asking their teachers. ""Why did Bodhidharma come to China?"" and ""Why did Shakyamuni meditated after his awakening?"". If you asked these questions during Huangbo and Linji era then you would be smacked, will you stop seeking it? Is this all that takes to convince you?

The way I look at it, for the reason that with zazen at least you are your personal master and explorer, you have direct experience. And when you passively accept that there is nothing to attain then you are going solely on blind faith that there is in fact nothing to attain so you might as well do nothing but is this direct experience? 

After meditating for years, how can you potentially be sore and frown upon meditation and look at it as a waste of time when the very meditation gave you the answer. (Assuming that ""nothing to attain"" is actually true and we are disregarding original definition of enlightenment that Buddha attained). To give you something to thing about, early Chan masters did in fact meditate and this tradition was reinstated with Caodong/Soto school, while later more famous Chan masters disregarded meditation. So who is right and who is wrong? Would you not want to drive on that road yourself to see where it leads because if you dont then why be here and not find refugee in nihilism philosophy? It certainly does not require any meditation.

Another way I look at zazen, is this not attainment of the Dharma eye and the void? 

My analogy to zazen and meditation is comparing mind to a glass of water

In a temple in the northern part of Japan two brother monks were dwelling together. The elder one was learned

A wandering monk came and asked for lodging, told the younger one to take his place. ""Go and request the dialogue in silence,"" he cautioned.

So the young monk and the stranger went to the shrine and sat down.

Shortly afterwards the traveler rose and went in to the elder brother and said: ""Your young brother is a wonderful fellow. He defeated me.""

""Relate the dialogue to me

""Well, representing Buddha, the enlightened one. So he held up two fingers, signifying Buddha and his teaching. I held up three fingers, representing Buddha, his teaching, and his followers, indicating that all three come fromone realization. Thus he won and so I have no right to remain here."" With this

""Where is that fellow?"" asked the younger one

""I understand you won the debate.""

""Won nothing. I'm going to beat him up.""

""Tell me the subject of the debate

""Why, so I held up two fingers, congratulating him that he has two eyes. Then the impolite wretch held up three fingers, suggesting that between us we only have three eyes. So I got mad and started to punch him, but he ran out and that ended it!""

Excerpt from the Lankavatara Sutra (trans. Pine) where the Buddha (Bhagavan) was (still) answering Mahamati's questions:

Mahamati once more asked the Buddha: ""The Bhagavan has said, nor will I speak a single word, for not speaking is how a buddha speaks.' Bhagavan, why does the Tathagata, the Arhat, the Fully Enlightened one say 'not speaking is how a buddha speaks'?""

The Buddha told Mahamati

""And what do I mean by the truth that depends on personal realization? Whatever other tathagatas realize, nothing less. But the ultimate realm of the truth that depends on personal realization is beyond explanations or distinctions and beyond dualistic terms.

""And what do I mean by the ever-present truth? This refers to the way of the ancient sages. The Dharma Realm is ever-present, where he enjoys whatever he desires. Mahamati, what do you think? Did he make the road or that city's delights?"" 

Mahamati answered

The Buddha told Mahamati, I do not speak, nor have I spoken, nor will I speak a single word.""

-----
Compare with Huangbo:

""Even the three kinds of thousands of great chiliocosms [realms] are all your own self, then all sounds and forms are the wisdom-eyes of Buddha.  The Dharma that phenomena are real does not raise a solitary thing that depends on a created realm.  Even so, for sentient beings the Buddha used many different kinds of wisdom.  However, Buddha spoke all day and said nothing; and sentient beings listened from morning to night but heard nothing.  In this sense it can be asserted that Buddha Shakyamuni spoke the Dharma for forty-nine years but never spoke a single word.""

How could you tell a two-dimensional being to look up or down from their two dimensional plane? No words or concepts in their language would describe it. No matter what direction they looked, it appears as though we're here, that there are phenomena. How could it be otherwise? But you can imagine our reality is like a roll of film played in an empty room. The roll of film differs not at all whether it's played or not! There's light, and sound, and it's still just a projection, or an illusion, because no one or nothing observes it. And everything is one. This universe, and more

That's zen. It doesn't have anything to do with meditation and cushions. It only has a little to do with koans.

Of course, trying to express what I myself cannot truly perceive. In fact, it's so tricky to get your mind to bend just the right way that it's impossible to say anything about it without being wrong. The hope is that it somehow triggers you to see your true nature, or the true nature. Any thought that I have that I have grasped or understood the third dimension is above me is false, which does nothing at all to negate it's reality, as if by chance a monkey had typed out Shakespeare in the absence of human society. A false understanding has arisen in my mind, with the knowledge that it is itself illusion, taking down every word, and that there is no correct. They all hinged on meaning having meaning

What is it that doesn't arise due to causes and conditions, and how could something ever have come out of it? Maybe nothing did. Maybe nothing has. Maybe that does not contradict that you seem to exist here and now reading this. How could that be?

I don't know what I can say to reach you. I probably can't say anything. I have to way no express this. No one can. But if you go on seeking, non-dualism, perhaps some meditation, perhaps some koan practice, you might just trigger an understanding beyond anything you've ever known, that ironically stands in contraindication to itself. You read these words, and they have meaning. Because they're set in the context of your mind. You're set in the context of a human society. When you expand beyond all context, and it undoes itself

I don't know if I can say it any plainer than that. And it's easy to understand why Zen masters would destroy written texts. It's so very easy to get caught on the words. The words are meaningless! These words are meaningless! Meaning is an illusion that arises from reality reflecting on itself. But I call it illusion for a reason, yet by chance, his every word, action, and deed made it appear so, and he himself could not tell he was not sentient? How could this be? Were you to ask him, ""are you sentient?"" he would reply, that there is no distinction between you

Where do numbers come from? The natural numbers, even non-existent points on a line. We get them by naming all of the numbers around them. 2 exists because we define 1 and 3 around it in the natural numbers. Each one is nothing, absolutely nothing, and in a miraculous act of creation, we bring them into existence as a set, all defined in terms of each other. Our reality itself is like this, which may be why mathematics describes it so well. It's all nothing, of no area, or ""not-existing""

I only mean this to point the way, it would be no meaning, and would undo itself, like a letter that burns up upon reading it, and also burns every book in the Library of Congress in the process. 

If you tell me I'm wrong, but rehashed and dulled by cultural gaps and elapsed centuries. This is a very small attempt to cast it into something more modern, and it's not well served by an excess of words in any case.

To enter by practice refers to four all-inclusive practices: Suffering injustice, and practicing the Dharma. First, suffering injustice. When those who search for the Path encounter adversity, they should think to themselves, ""In Countless ages gone by, I’ve turned from the essential to the trivial and wandered through all manner of existence, often angry without cause and guilty of numberless transgressions.

Now, adapting to conditions. As mortals, we’re ruled by conditions, not by ourselves. All the suffering and joy we experience depend on conditions. If we should be blessed by some great reward, such as fame or fortune, it’s the fruit of a seed planted by us in the past. When conditions change, it ends. Why delight In Its existence? But while success and failure depend on conditions

Third, seeking. But the wise wake up. They choose reason over custom. They fix their minds on the sublime and let their bodies change with the seasons. All phenomena are empty. They contain nothing worth desiring. Calamity forever alternates with Prosperity! To dwell in the three realms is to dwell in a burning house. To have a body is to suffer. Does anyone with a body know peace? Those who understand this detach themselves from all that exists and stop Imagining or seeking anything. The sutras say, ""To seek is to suffer.

To seek nothing is bliss."" When you seek nothing, all appearances are empty. Defilement and attachment, subject and object don’t exist. The sutras say, ""The Dharma includes no being because it’s free from the impurity of being, and the Dharma includes no self because it’s free from the impurity of self."" Those wise enough to believe and understand these truths are bound to practice according to the Dharma. And since that which is real includes nothing worth begrudging, they give their body, life, without regret, and without bias or attachment. And to eliminate impurity they teach others, they practice nothing at all. This is what’s meant by practicing the Dharma.

The book is very valuable, and I am giving it to you to represent your successorhip.""

""If the book is such an important thing

I told him

He said
""But why do you feel that the spontaneous is better?"" I said. Because no method is

Because of this Zen has become a craze in the West -- because Zen says
effortlessly; there is no need of effort. Zen is right; there is no need for an effort. But
remember
a point where no effort is needed
a long effort will be needed.
But the superficial conclusion that Zen says no effort is needed has become very
appealing in the West. If no effort is needed then the mind says: this is the right thing
because you can do it without doing anything. But no one can do it.
Suzuki, one of the
most authentic men of this century
message of Zen to the West. And alone
West. And now there is a craze; there are Zen friends all over the West. Nothing appeals
like Zen now.
But the point is missed. The appeal has come only because Zen says no method is
needed
This is right -- but you are not spontaneous
spontaneous... It looks absurd and contradictory
methods are needed to purify you
Otherwise you cannot be spontaneous in anything.

This VIGYANA BHAIRAVA TANTRA was translated into English by Paul Reps. He
has written a very beautiful book, and just in the appendix
he included this book VIGYANA BHAIRAVA TANTRA.
The whole book is concerned with Zen; just in the appendix he added this book also
one hundred and twelve methods
didn't like this because they said
concerned only with effort. This book is concerned only with methods
method,
but deep down they are not
long way.

One of Gurdjieff's disciples, whenever someone would come to
him to ask about the path

you are already on the path. Even the path is far away. From where you are
point
very humble man
difficult

need just now to discuss it."" Wherever you are
bridge
Spontaneity -- SAHAJ YOGA -- is very far away from you.
In the place where you are
spontaneous -- NOTHING
life
spontaneous. Even love is a bargain
Then nothing can be spontaneous. And then to explode spontaneously into the cosmos is
impossible.
From the situation you are in
throw away all your artificiality,
all your prejudices. Only then will a spontaneous happening be possible. These methods
will help you to come to a point from where nothing is needed to be done -- just your
being is enough. But mind can deceive. And mind easily deceives
consolation.
Shiva never talks about any result
something
being can just dissolve into the cosmos. But that has to be achieved. Zen's appeal is for
the wrong reasons
needed
right.
He is right
and Shiva is also right.
And as far as YOU are concerned
between Krishnamurti and Shiva
Even this can be said to help you -- that Krishnamurti is absolutely wrong. Remember
say to help you. And he is harmful. That too I say to help you
argument you will not achieve samadhi. You will achieve only one conclusion -- that no
method is needed. And that is dangerous. For you method is needed!
There comes a moment when no method is needed
yet. And before that moment
why Shiva is silent. He will not say anything of the future
simply sticks to you
on talking in terms which cannot be understood by you.

The logic can be felt. The logic is right; it is beautiful. It will be good if you can
remember the logic of Krishnamurti. He says that if you are doing some method
who is doing that method? The mind is doing it. And how can any method done by mind
dissolve mind? Rather
mind more. It will become a conditioning
So meditation is spontaneous; you cannot do anything about it. What can you do about
love? Can you practice any method for how to love? If you practice
be false.
It happens
practiced? How can meditation be practiced?
The logic is exactly
continuously you will be conditioned by this logic. And those who have been listening to
Krishnamurti for forty years are the most conditioned persons I have come across. They
say there is no method
I say
has the spontaneity flowered in you?"" They say
And if I tell them

They have not been practicing any method

dilemma. They have not moved an inch
something which was not for them.

It is like teaching a small child about sex. You can go on teaching
something which is as yet meaningless for the child. And your teaching will be dangerous
because you are conditioning his mind. It is not his need; he is not concerned with it. He
doesn't know what sex means because his glands are still not functioning; his body is still
not sexual.
His energy has not yet moved biologically to the sex center
Because he has ears
nod his head
You can teach
inquiry for him
maturity where sex becomes significant. Wait! When he begins to inquire
matures and when he asks questions

phenomenon of meditation.

You can be taught only about methods
without getting a foothold on the method
mental affair. And then you will always miss the method.
It is like small children doing arithmetic. They can always go to the back of the book and
can know the answer. The answer is there; at the back of the book
They can look at the question
once a child knows the answer it is very difficult for him to learn the method
there seems to be no need. When he already knows the answer
And really
Then through any false

method. And this happens so much in religion that it seems
concerned
The answer is not good for you. The question is there

teachers do not help you to know the answer before the process is done

have stolen some answer from somewhere

&gt; If you want to avoid the suffering of life and death

&gt; This mind is originally pure. It was not born with this body and does not die with its extinction. What's more, like waves from the ocean, the many thoughts arise out of this original nature. They are like reflections from a mirror. That's why you must first see where thoughts come from if you want to understand your mind. So whether asleep or awake, standing or sitting, you must question deeply, ""What is this mind?"" The deep desire to realize this is called religious practice, training, or the Wayseeking mind. Questioning your mind in this manner is also referred to as *zazen*.

&gt; When you ask yourself who the master is who at this very moment sees with the eyes, moves the feet, you realize that all these operations are the work of your mind. But you don't know why it works that way. You may say it doesn't exist, but it is clear that something is freely functioning. You may say it does exist, but you can't see it.

&gt; Now when this [inquiry] feels insurmountable and you are unable to understand anything

&gt;Don't let yourself fall back at this time. As you pursue this inquiry more deeply, and you will no longer question the fact that your mind is Buddha. There will be no [world of] life and death to despise and no truth to seek. The world of the great void will be the one mind.

To attain pure mind, or under the earth, but in your mind. Usually the working part of the mind and the stuff in it are considered together in Buddhism – mind and mind-stuff. If mind is like pure water, then mind-stuff is like ashes in it.

When the everyday mind that has mind-stuff in it relates to something else, I wish I had that...” There is no hell under the earth to which you will go when you die. There is just this impure mind. This impure mind is hell.

In meditation, but in the evening when you come home, you keep your mind quiet and let the mind-stuff settle down. When you have practiced this settling down of the mine-stuff, even though your mind is full of mind-stuff, you can feel that the nature of mind is originally pure. The great ocean that produces Mount Sumeru, the world, is not always clean and pure on the surface

In the daytime, it is just the same. He dreams, hates, loves, possesses as in the daytime. There is no time that the mind settles down and there is clear water on top.

It is best to associate with people who have pure minds. If you associate with someone who has an impure mind, while the pure-minded person will see through to your meaning immediately. You have no trouble when you associate with pure-minded people.

There are many religions in the world, you confess everything to God and your mind becomes pure. In Buddhism, you meditate. Perhaps it will come into your mind: “He insulted me today.” You shake your head and forget about it. Or: “I lost all my money today.” And you shake your head and forget that, too.

So I guess you could say

But the more I think about Zen, the more I understand (or think I understand) Zen as being okay and accepting all emotions. It's about living with and accepting the fact that humans are afraid of death and that it's okay to grieve when one dies. 

I'm mostly looking for a second opinion. How has your practice changed your ideas and attitudes towards death? I know we're supposed to sit without gaining anything

    its substance is void of relative or absolute.
    Golden waves all around
    Zen is constant
    Thoughts arise
    don't try to shut them off.
    Let them flow spontaneously –
    what has ever arisen and vanished?
    When arising and vanishing quiet down
    there appears the great Zen master;
    sitting,
    there's never an interruption.
    When meditating
    When sitting
    Only when you have understood this way
    is it called sitting meditation.
    Who is it that sits? What is meditation?
    To try to seat it
    is using Buddha to look for Buddha.
    Buddha need not be sought;
    seeking takes you further away.
    In sitting
    meditation is not an external art.
    At first
    there is still no choice but to shift it back.
    That is why there are many methods
    to teach it quiet observation.
    When you sit up and gather your spirit
    at first it scatters helter-skelter;
    over a period of time
    opening and freeing the six senses.
    When the six senses rest a bit
    discrimination occurs therein.
    As soon as discrimination occurs
    it seems to produce arising and vanishing.
    The transformations of arising and vanishing
    come from manifestations of one's own mind.
    Put your own mind to use to look back once:
    once you've returned
    you wear a halo of light on your head.
    The spiritual flames leap and shine
    unobstructed in any state of mind
    all-inclusive
    birth and death forever cease.
    A single grain of restorative elixir
    turns gold into liquid;
    acquired pollution of body and mind
    have no way to get through.
    Confusion and enlightenment are temporarily explained;
    stop discussing opposition and accord.
    When I think carefully of olden days
    when I sat coolly seeking
    though it's nothing different
    it was quite a mess.
    You can turn from ordinary mortal to sage
    in an instant
    All over the earth is unclarity;
    best be very careful.
    If it happens you do not know
    then sit up straight and think;
    one day you'll bump into it.
    This I humbly hope.

I have read a fair amount of the discussions in past posts about non-attachment/detachment, from a zen perspective do the ideas of non-attachment,  not caring, detachment and indifference differ in meaning and actual action. 
 
Optional Fun part: if you are so inclined
 
Example:
Zen master: Thoughts are like birds. They fly in and flutter about, they behave according to their nature. It's not that I don't care that the thoughts are there, for they are essential to functioning. I am indifferent to their quality or nature as they arise from the same wellspring. Zen is neither action or inaction thus nothing to be attached or non-attached to, detached from or indifferent to, caring or uncaring about.  
 
Zen student: Thoughts are like actions in that they happen. I go for a walk and see a dead bird on the path. I move the bird off of the patch and perhaps honor what it is. I am not attached to the idea of it being alive because it is already dead

As I sat breathing with my eyes closed

*While inhaling

As soon as I began, and out of my control my mind was. I could hardly keep mindful attention and awareness on my breathing without thinking about the dozens, or hundreds, of possible other things I could be thinking or doing. 

After a minute or two, so I took it off the hook on the wall, set it in my bedroom where I wouldn't be able to hear it, and returned to meditating.

Several minutes in, I caught myself thinking, ""Breathe... I am breathing out,"" when I was actually breathing in! I realized I was merely trying to memorize the words without actually paying attention to what I was doing and thinking.

After about 10 minutes, and become more aware of what I was thinking and doing. 

After 15 minutes had passed, let the absent thought float away, and return to focusing on my breathing.

After 20 minutes, on the words, ""Breathe... I am breathing in. Breathe... I am breathing out,"" and I ended my session there.

I probably have a lot more progress to make in the coming days

When I feel my mind beginning to wander, and return to meditating on my breathing.

Another note: Early on, ""You aren't doing well. Do better!"" Also, later on, there were times where I became proud at my progress and my ability to maintain focus, so I started to tell myself, ""Well done! You're focusing so well."" You can see the irony in this. By taking my focus off of my breathing, and beginning to focus on whether or not I was ""doing well""

But for some reason, also seems to kind of loosen the grip of both polarities. Here, I think there are two aspects. One is emotional equanimity, which mostly seems to have to do with meditation; when I meditate frequently and well, I simply don't get very upset or unhealthily elated.

The other is harder to explain, I sweat, and so on, there's still a sense in which my ""mind"" is neither warm nor cold. The various phenomena called ""warmth"" are very vividly present, but in some sense, they don't ""touch me."" This seems like something that is obviously true, but that I haven't really paid much attention to before I started doing Zen.

&gt;""Nanyue went to him and asked, “I am intending to be a buddha.” Nanyue picked up a brick and started polishing it. Baso said, “What are you doing?” Nanyue said,”I am trying to make a mirror,” Baso said, “How can you make a mirror by polishing a brick?” Nanyue said, “How can you become a buddha by doing zazen?” 

That got me thinking and the more I thought about it the more I realize that zazen is the best practice. And here is why.

Scholars date birth of Buddha somewhere between 500BCE and 400BCE, it is believed that Buddhas teaching was passed on as an oral tradition and hasn't been committed to writings for over 400 years. So here we are, Zen Buddhism, we know that in Zen we should not label and/or conceptualize things, we should see them for what they are. After reading some texts, I cant help but questions certain teachings and certain writings. Example: Koan system, I cant help but ask myself why? What is the point, doesn't that sound a bit religious and ""feel good""? And many other sutras, how can we be sure?

The answer is zazen. If you think about it, Bodhidharma was a Bodhisattva but he still meditated for 10 years straight. If we can not get direct guidance and teachings from Buddha then surely we can practice what he practiced. 

My poor analogy is this. If our minds are like muddy water and Buddha spent 7 years meditating and settling his mind so it becomes crystal clear then how can we understand what Zen is if we still have our minds like muddy water

&gt;It is said that Gautama Buddha gathered his disciples one day for a Dharma talk. When they gathered together, Mahākāśyapa, silently gazed at the flower and broke into a broad smile. The Buddha then acknowledged Mahākāśyapa’s insight by saying the following:

&gt; We were delighted that Engler accepted our invitation to be a keynote speaker. His chapter, he shifts his focus to examine the ways that Western practitioners of Buddhism tend to subvert Buddhist practice by using it to avoid facing issues that are often also the subject of psychotherapy- employing, for example, ""practices like meditation in the service of defense, rather than self-awareness."" He shows just how deeply embedded issues such as avoidance of responsibility and fear of intimacy can be, and how easy it is to escape into new and exotic religious practices.

Shariputra, not defiled, not pure; and they neither increase nor diminish. Therefore, in emptiness there is no form, feeling, cognition, formation, ears, or mind; no sights, objects of touch

Because nothing is attained, and he leaves distorted dream-thinking far behind. Ultimately Nirvana! All Buddhas of the three periods of time attain Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi through reliance on Prajna Paramita. Therefore know that Prajna Paramita is a Great Spiritual Mantra, a Great Bright Mantra, a Supreme Mantra, an Unequalled Mantra. It can remove all suffering; it is genuine and not false.

&gt;
""Don't misdirect your efforts. Don't chase around looking for something apart from your own selves. All you have to do is to concentrate on being thoughtless, is the direct path of sudden realization. No practice, no realization - that is the true principle, things as they really are. The enlightened ones themselves, those who possess every attribute of Buddhahood, have called this supreme, unparalleled
&gt;
People hear this teaching and try to follow it. Choking off their aspirations. Sweeping their minds clean of delusive thoughts. They dedicate themselves solely to doing nothing and to making their minds complete blanks
&gt;
When a person who has not had kensho reads the Buddhist scriptures, he is merely creating the causes of his own illusion - a sure sign that he is still confined within samsara. He tries constantly to keep himself detached in thought and deed, and all the while his thoughts and deeds are attached. He endeavors to be doing nothing all day long, and all the while he is busily doing.
&gt;

(original around 0700 UTC)

Hi all

So I've been wanting to expand and diversify the /r/zen moderation team for a couple months now, perhaps even a formal commitment of some sort.  This isn't meant to exclude those of us who approach Zen from other angles; I do very much aim to keep Zen Reddit the kind of place that welcomes a diverse range of perspectives, but at the same time, I'm trying to ensure that the voice of formal Zen isn't lost in the process.  

This wave will hopefully bring us two new moderators.  I've selected one of them now from my first call

First, out of which 2 appear to be both available and have had some sort of sangha connection.  I'd like to introduce [Jigetsu](/u/Jigetsu).  Jigetsu has been practising Soto Zen for a year and a half in the Treeleaf Sangha and has taken up lay ordination in January 2012.  I'll have to confess that on online sangha like Treeleaf wasn't quite what I had in mind initially, but I think I'm coming around to the idea.  It'd be an interesting compromise for one (between formality and diversity), and it could give him some insight into how Zen forums should run.  Let's see how this works out.  Welcome, Jigetsu!

Second

1. sanitation - cleaning the modqueue
2. infrastructure - maintaining the sidebar
3. animation - running eg. the koan of the month
4. management - deciding moderator policy

I'm happy to consider applications from all backgrounds

But I cannot know for sure if this is actually what mystics are talking about, or if they are genuinely focused on a supernatural deity.

I ask for your opinions on this

Could a person practice Zen and mysticism or are they ultimately leading down different paths, and likewise, the search for the ""Beloved"" would distract the zen student. Am I wrong in thinking these two approaches are divergent and will not produce the same outcomes?

I live in the Midwest in the United States. I grew up Protestant Christian, I'm part Italian. I've struggled my whole with both these religions. But I have connected with Catholicism the most, and have found a lot of aspects of it that I love.

About 10 years ago when I was around 14-15 I read something, ""short defines long, big defines small, and good defines evil."" And in the moment everything seemed different. My whole way of thinking just completely changed, and I just realized that for my entire life I was viewing things in the wrong way. But not knowing anything about Buddhism or what Zen was I just went on with my life with this idea in the back of my mind. Every now and then I would see a picture, or a scene outside, or a sound and it just felt right. It felt like it was perfect. The Earth would seem like it had completely stopped. The feeling only lasted a few seconds and then it would slip away. Or sometimes I would walk around the woods, and I would walk around a feel as if I was the only person alive and the whole woods

Now that I have gotten older I have became aware of Buddhism and Zen only from what I have picked up occasionally from TV or the internet. Just like seeing pictures of ""Zen"" books in like Barnes-N-Noble

1271526220.0,bscxx,Last night I dreamed of the Buddha's house.,radiomojo,18,3,8,"I got up this morning and wrote this down.  I am not a practicing Buddhist




Last night I dreamed of the Buddha's house.   I followed him home from work.  He does work - nearly every day as a gardener (what else).  He drove along the highway in a non-descript car

 

The turnoff to the Buddha's house was obscured by trees and vines

 

Just a few short feet from the highway sat his home.  While the grounds and the surrounding yard looked normal, columns and beam.  Whole corners shifted moment to moment as the house grew, changed shape, bloomed, died and was reborn.  The general dimensions remained the same and it was small and modest with no ""curb appeal"".  In fact it looked like nothing from the front.  There was not porch or portico, no facade or even windows on the side of the little house facing the street.

 

In the back was the entrance

 

There was a group of chairs arranged in a semi-circle around a fire pit.  There was a small grill for preparing food.  Finally there was a partially shaded altar.

 

The altar caught my attention for I wondered - what would the Buddha have on his altar

As I approached the altar I saw flowers and candles

 

The back door opened and the Buddha walked out



Now - while I consider myself an atheist



The  story and house elements


1) The Buddha works as a Gardner - This did not feel to have anything to do with cultivating men or enlightenment.  It seemed more to me to be about the idea that work was good so the Buddha worked.  He was a gardener because it was work that kept him connected to the rhythm of things



2) The Buddha drove a non-descript car down the highway - nothing special about the car as the vehicle for transport through life or down the ""path"" was relevant.   The highway is just a modern path and while path's may change in form the function and meaning remain the same.



3) The turn off to his house came suddenly and without warning - Enlightenment happens suddenly.  There is no blinker or signal.  There are no signs.  If one is racing to the destination on the path one will miss it entirely for it is right in front of our face, no surface street transition.   The path keep s going at full speed and the turnoff is instantly different.   Once one knows where it is, one can describe it or guide travelers to it, but only if they agree to look for it. 



4) The Buddha's house is right off the main highway - Enlightenment is not on a far off mountain top or a long journey from here.  It is right there



5) The Buddha's house changes moment to moment- Enlightenment is different for every person who sees it.  Each moment is different like each moment is different and ever changing around us.  But all who see it recognize the general shape and function ( a house) even if it is completely different in form and detail for every traveler.



6) There is no facade or porch - what it appears to the public



7) The house is small - Enlightenment is not a palace nor mansion.  It is not a heavenly paradise or grand reward.   It is shelter from the storm.  It is ""home"".



8)The yard and grounds did not change like the house - The truth is that everything is changing moment to moment, also changing moment to moment. 



Elements in the yard (basics for practice?)


1) the carport - maintain the vehicle - the physical vehicle that you travel in must be sheltered and maintained.  It can be modest.  But that should not be overlooked.



2) The chairs - maintain your connections with people - fellowship and companionship are good.  Time and interaction should be shared and this house should always be ready to receive guests.



3) The grill - maintain sustenance - this was not a small personal grill but a small family size grill.  Sustenance cannot be overlooked but it too should be shared freely.  Plan to not just eat but to cook for many and share in the process.



4) The Altar -maintain meditation- The Buddha did not meditate in front of a Buddha.  Instead he has on the altar a human.  The divinity is in is us and was from the very beginning. The divine power is not in achieving Buddhahood but in that from the very beginning every human has it in them already.

It's time for our fifth student to student session. Our volunteer this month comes by way of suggestion from /u/grass_skirt (many thanks! suggestions for volunteers are very welcome)

From time to time, a [public fountain][zazen-public-water], a [train station][zazen-public-train]. These videos are published by the [Melbourne Zen Centre][mzc], founded by Seikan Čech.

Seikan has been practising for at least 18 years; he ordained as a monk at Antaji under Muhō Nölke and has since gone on to found the MZC as well as the Melbourne Zen Hospice

Seikan has made the room to take on one of our questions; let's make it a good one. It sounds like we have a lot of interesting hooks, Zen in Australia, or maybe just anything that happens to be on your mind about Zen and Zen practice in general.  Anything you wanted to ask a Zen monk?  How about firing off a question in the comments?

## How this works

*One Monk

1. (You) reply to this post
2. We collect questions for a week
3. On 31 July, the top-voted one or one they find particularly interesting
4. By 4 Aug
5. We post and archive the answer.

This month we'll be experimenting with a list of standard questions that we'll try asking at each of sessions (thanks to everybody who posted suggestions).  I'll  follow up with a comment showing our standard selection.

1376386203.0,1k9or0,Some insights I had tonight about no-thing-ness. Maybe helpful for those that have gotten stuck in similar ruts as I have.,prunck,14,2,27,"I wanted to share some insights I had tonight while taking my walk.  Obviously the conclusions really can't be described in words

First

I have always been a 'thinker' type, my current spiritual growth came from my attempt to understand morality and philosophy from the point of view of science and logic.  I had known that a lot of conclusions I had drawn from this clean-slate approach were similar to many eastern philosophies, but it wasn't until I had started reading [Gödel, Escher, Bach](http://www.amazon.com/G%C3%B6del-Escher-Bach-Eternal-Golden/dp/0465026567) that I became interested in Zen, a subject touched on a few times in the book, particularly Mumon and Joshu and their koans.

A quick aside about the contents of the book, or incomplete, meaning that not all things that are true in the system are provable.  

What this means is that once you define any set of axioms that can be useful for anything interesting (for the less mathematically inclined, you can immediately know that what you defined can never justify every truth without being self contradictory.  It is from this fundamental incompleteness that springs increasingly unintuitive ideas (negative numbers, irrational numbers, complex numbers, etc.) that are added to our axiomatic repertoire in order to reach the truths that were previously inaccessible.  [This image](http://www.dalank.de/notabene/phil1.html) from the book, which I will reference again in a bit, might be helpful in understanding this.  The reachable truths are merely a specific branching of a set of axioms that you have previously defined.  You add more axioms to reach more truths

Ok

So I was out for a walk, possibly due to habit, my mind wandered over to the deeper questions, particularly the one of no-thing-ness.  I hear this term a lot, but its significance has always been slightly out of my grasp.  I couldn't quite work my way past the idea that there is clearly some-thing that exists, because there is an experience that is playing itself out before me that wouldn't be there without a some-thing to be watching it.  And yet, the idea of a some-thing makes no sense, but i didn't really ""get"" it.

So I took the contrapositive approach and started with the assumption that instead of this some-thing that I can't help but see

Well, which means that non-existence also doesn't exist in the no-thing universe.

It was at about that point that something clicked.  This no-thing universe is exactly the universe I live in.  No-thing-ness does not need an original mover because there is no-thing to move.  No-thing is the actual nothing which is the state that it makes the most sense for the universe to be in

I'll try to clarify it a little further with [the image I referenced earlier](http://www.dalank.de/notabene/phil1.html).  We think, and the things that don't exist or can't exist as the 'falsehoods'.  In actuality, imagine if every pixel in the image, every supposed truth or falsehood, is neither black nor white, but is completely clear and undefined.  This also means that all things are simultaneously true and false, or, can freely take on either form

Looking at it this way, you don't not exist, but you also don't exist.  You no-exist.  But you already no-exist, so the only thing you won't have is the limitations of your ego-self.  But then, who is this ""you"" that wont have them?  

I might have caused more confusion than clarity with this post.  I just wanted to give those that tend to think the same way I do a way out of some thinking-traps that are hard to get out of for the rationally inclined.  Don't listen to my words

tl;dr: MU

It is not an esoteric process but it can be hard. It means simply going for certain stretches of time, fully alert but without thoughts (not falling into some sort of trance or stupor.) There are different ways to do this, for example one-pointed concentration and ""choiceless awareness.""

And so he came up to the aged monk, from his truly enlightened perspective, proceeded to lecture the old man on the futility and stupidity of worshiping mere forms. Finally, his brief rant over, he realized that, having traveled such a long way to meet the “master,” he should probably ask the old monk for whatever wisdom he had to share. “So, what can you tell me about full enlightenment?”

I think it's first important to talk about what arhatta is. Arhatta is an ancient concept that exists in most Indian religions, actions, doctrine, ritual and memorization one can attain the status of arhatta. 

One could say that perfect dogma leads to perfect arhatta. There are arhats of Hinduism

Gautama Buddha came along and saw that the path to arhatta was convoluted in the Hindu religion. He also showed that arhatta was nearly impossible to attain in Hinduism if you were not born to the right family

Gautama Buddha however became a buddha, which one attains through a spontaneous flash of insight, *not* years of perfect religious adherence. 

It's unlikely that Gautama Buddha intended for people to follow his ideas in the pursuit of arhatta by dogma, including Tibetan, Theravada, Mahayana and others.

we may speak here

We speak of and point to the

imply in any way
go thru the door. To speak in the
anteroom does not in any way
qualify or accurately describe or
explain what is beyond the door.

Those of us who speak here
who know we are in the anteroom
know that our words do not
emanate from beyond the door.

Some speakers have the habit
of speaking here in the anteroom
as though they are beyond the door.

Those of us in the anteroom who
have been thru the door
that there is no speaking beyond
the door. We may speak here in
the anteroom
to speak as tho we are beyond
while we are here
serious schism in the speaker.

Those of us who talk back to those
who speak as tho they are beyond
the door

Wake up
here you may speak. You may
describe immense infinite vistas
you may bawl endless tears of
gratitude
on about what concerns you.

just like whipping a running horse on.



Once the question mass cracks

your eyes will open wide and light up the prior time to the universe.



Just stick to hwadu and don't loose it.

Struggling with it



Endless questioning will be like a fireball

and suddenly you will awake from the long dream of life and death.



Innumerable years of quiet zazen

made the thinking walllike and all the others forgotten.



With keen questioning through millions of thoughts

I passed rivers and mountains



Raise the question of hwadu every way.

Don't keep anything but hwadu.



Nothing is left


All is silent



In a street or thick woods


only Nirvana ecstasy is always for him absorbed in hwadu.



Go right ahead without looking elsewhere.



When you take one step forward where you cannot go further

there will truly not be any matter at all

and you can pass through a thorny thicket



The integrity of proud loneliness is lofty

like a great mountain

and dhyana is free like a sea gull



Reverse a round desperately with all your strength

and passion-free world will be clear beyond in and out.


The essence of hwadu lies in great questioning.


When the question defeats the blue eyes of Boddhidharma

you will be free to kill and revive others


The subtlety of zen is from keenness.

Dull questioning cannot solve the life and death problem.



When the question cracks

and time will fuse in a beam of cold light.



Be always earnest in pondering over hwadu

and sweep out worldly idle thoughts by the question.


Only after you let go the hold on the bottomless cliff

the earth and space will disappear all together.



As the question cracks and passions die suddenly

there is no shade in every direction all the way.



As the spacious spirits void all directions


you can stroll about and relax even on the way to Eternal Hell

accompany various people and pass like a wind.


Liberation by zen practice is not so hard

only if you turn a thought round instantly.


Where waters end and mountains are passed

there is no water and no mountain

yet mountain is mountain and water is water.

Furthermore, your reality is just the same as the reality of all living beings, the reality of all things, and the reality of all the holy ones.

Not sure if it was the influence of society, etc., (not that it really matters I guess), but it seemed obvious that one would not want to be a ""chump""...a chump being one who is wronged somehow and doesn't take action to remedy this injustice.

For example

A lot of thinking/being later I've come to realize that someone allowing themselves to be a chump is actually a stronger person because they do not let external circumstances and concepts dictate how they feel.  If someone were to steal from me today

A lot of this has to do with the buddha's saying about picking up a hot coal to throw at an enemy or the zen master who would not testify against the thief who stole his stuff because he ""gave"" it to the thief.

TLDR: being a chump can be zen

Here’s one aspect of it that I’ve been thinking a little bit about lately. Please don’t hesitate to point out how stupid my thinking on this is -- any kind of discussion, is welcome.

The aspect is: people get upset about it. It can be painful to talk about. Lots of emotions are aroused. There’s frustration, pride, humility, and so on.

Especially on here

I think the significant difference is that most other Zen forums have a big share of people who are pretty comfortable in their social identities as Zen practitioners, having teachers. And for some reason this makes the discussion pretty nice and friendly. You could make a caricature of it, with people talking about how great the veggie food is at Great Dragon Moon River Monastery, and so on. 

Well, and I was thinking about how you could relate it to a concept of “crisis,” and maybe even make a whole economic metaphor about it, but I probably won’t get that far with this, so I’ll just write some “cursory remarks” and hope you see why I find it so interesting -- maybe someone can clarify my weird thoughts.

One approach is to compare Zen to some other topic of discussion, or working out. These other topics have a great deal of diversity, novelty, and tangible hooks to hang your discussion on. That’s why lunch break discussion tends to revolve around this kind of “hobby” stuff with lots of different names, nouns, news, opinions

Well, when are you going to your next sesshin? And so on. Small talk. It can be very fun! And very dull…

I’ve tried to start some “small talk” threads on here, I think. Good for the sense of community, if that’s a desirable thing. But of course we can’t have a whole subreddit called Zen if it’s just small talk.

So one fun move here might be to put “small talk” on one end of a spectrum, or really get upset about.

Now that we’ve got that spectrum set up, there’s very little explicit instruction about what’s “supposed” to happen in dokusan -- it’s up to you and the teacher. But the basic advice is to avoid both “small talk” and “big talk.” Neither is relevant here! There are other times for them. I guess you could say dokusan transcends them.

And for this reason, painful. I think it’s one of the most interesting experiences I’ve had in Zen practice. I go in there, make a bow, sit down, and… Sometimes I just wish I had a tangible problem with my zazen or something. “My back really hurts, what should I do?” Or “I’m just feeling extremely sleepy, and I can never concentrate at all.” But usually I don’t. Then I just don’t know what to say. But I’m sitting there. It’s intense. What could I say? All sorts of doubts, weird stuff happens…

I could try to make some kind of joke, I saw a frog.” That might be pretty nice. But still, just a posture. I suppose it’s possible I could even pull off some kind of act. But then she’ll ask something, and the game will be up, and I will just feel like a biggest douchebag, a total failure, an extremely terrible Zen student

Anyway, precisely because it excludes both “chit-chat” and “serious business,” and you are left to initiate something that you are held fully responsible for but that you don’t really understand.

The teacher will often ask something. “So, asking *WHO ARE YOU?*

And that brings me to the topic of “crisis.” Because that’s what these encounters seem to point to. My ordinary goods have no value anymore. I am insolvent. Personality, confusion, or sadness. Hell, I can’t even declare bankruptcy. All my words and ideas seem entirely beside the point, all my learning is good for nothing, even my precious meditation is worthless.

Some critics of capitalism talk about the concept of a “general crisis, ideas, feelings, aspirations. It manifests in diverse ways, both reactionary and revolutionary. It can cause confusion, despair, alienation. But also exhilarating joy and liberation.

This kind of crisis is not something that necessarily happens intensely overnight. It’s something that usually exists as a shadow

The idea here, and that it’s always present here as a kind of shadow, sometimes manifesting as frustration and even anger.

I think that’s all I’ll write for now. I hope you find something useful in this tedious chunk of text!",,t5_2qhmf,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/zen/comments/16vsva/talking_about_zen_and_the_idea_of_crisis/

I know you all talk about seem pretty deep stuff here (which I enjoy a lot) so this may seem trivial to some

I have been looking into replacing it with another one but everything I can find online looks very very cheap and tacky and generally of a poor construction. I’m not just basing this on looks but also customer reviews.  

I can only think because what I’m looking for is “desk” sized (for want of a better term) that people do not expect high quality goods as there aren’t many people who want it for serious purposes when they are that size.  

If anyone could point me in the direction of somewhere where I can buy one or even cobble together my own from a collection of items designed for another purpose I would be very very grateful! Thank you for taking the time to look at my post and thank you in advance for any help you can give!

May be likened unto the blazing sun sitting high in his meridian tower.
Such a man would teach nothing but the dharma for realizing the essence of mind
And his object in coming to this world would be to vanquish heretical sects.

We can hardly classify the dharmas into ""sudden"" and ""gradual""
But some men will attain enlightenment much quicker than others.
For example
Is above the comprehension of the ignorant.

We may explain it in ten thousand ways
But all those explanations may be traced back to one principle.
To illumine our gloomy tabernacle
We should constantly set up the light of wisdom.

Erroneous views keep us in defilement
While right views remove us from it
But when we are in a position to discard both of them
We are then absolutely pure.

Bodhi is immanent in our essence of mind
An attempt to look for it elsewhere is erroneous.
Within our impure mind the pure one is to be found
And once our mind is set right, and illusion].

If we are treading the path of enlightenment
We need not be worried about stumbling blocks.
Provided we keep a constant eye on our own faults
We cannot go astray from the right path.

Since every species of life has its own way of salvation
They will not interfere with or be antagonistic to one another.
But if we leave our own path and seek some other way of salvation
We shall not find it
And though we plod on till death overtakes us
We shall find only penitence in the end.

If you wish to find the true way
Right action will lead you to it directly;
But if you do not strive for buddhahood
You will grope in the dark and never find it.

He who treads the path in earnest
Sees not the mistakes of the world;
If we find fault with others
We ourselves are also in the wrong.

When other people are in the wrong
For it is wrong for us to find fault.
By getting rid of the habit of faultfinding
We cut off a source of defilement.

When neither hatred nor love disturbs our mind
Serenely we sleep.

Those who intend to be the teachers of others
Should themselves be skilled in the various expedients which lead others to enlightenment.
When the disciple is free from all doubts
It indicates that his essence of mind has been found.

The kingdom of buddha is in this world
Within which enlightenment is to be sought.
To seek enlightenment by separating from this world
Is as absurd as to search for a rabbit's horn.

Right views are called transcendental;
Erroneous views are called worldly.
When all views
Then the essence of bodhi appears.

This stanza is for the Sudden school.
It is also called the Great Ship of Dharma [for sailing across the ocean of existence].

Looking at the TV

These may be illusions, as if Siddhartha was left a street urchin beggar instead of a Brahmin's son; would he have been the same person?

I think that the fruit must be ripe before planting

Drugs and alcohol

So does the wind and rain come then and blow gale the seeds not firmly planted in soil that is well tended. As a stone falling into a pond

So take your children into your protection and hold on to their place.

&gt;
&gt; How about when they say the sound of the rain has given you a sermon?  Is that correct?  I do not agree; the sound of the rain is *you* giving a sermon.  But do you understand?  Clarify it directly; then what else is there?
