I started making weird faces and poses and what-not. Well, in the middle of all the silliness I accidentally yawned.

So I did what any stoned and silly person would do: I roared my indoor roar, when suddenly she stopped.

1337899853.0,u3iv2,How I've passed every (pre-employment) piss test--ladies only,,156,11,67,"1) **Obtain clean urine.** This can be purchased as a [synthetic](http://www.antitest.com/synthetic-urine/ultra-pure.html)

2) **Pour the sample into a condom free of lubricant and spermicide.** A regular lubed condom will work fine

3) **Knot that shiz tight.**  You don't want air bubbles

4) **Use a glass of hot water to bring up the temperature.** If you freeze the sample in the condom, freshen up the water to make it warm before insertion. Even if you DON'T freeze it, heat it up this way first. It's easier for your body to *maintain* temperature than heat up a foreign object that's room temp.

5) **Insert into Nature's Pocket.** This is the most awkward part, you need to be relaxed. It feels weird and you're going to worry about the condom leaking or breaking, but barring any kind of *vagina dentata* condition (and assuming you've knotted it securely) you're safe.

6) **Don't forget your implements!** Stick a bobby pin with a nubbin cut off in your hair

PROTIP: Stick a napkin or paper towel in your pocket (or bra) so you have somewhere to put the condom when you're done. Clinics have been getting more stringent with their policies--no running water in the restroom until you're done

If anyone wants to supplement this

Why Entwives is Better than /r/Trees

1. A smaller population. While having a larger population leads to increased exposure

2. Fewer teenagers/immature subscribers. Typically on /r/entwives, celebration and all the things the OP asked to receive. /r/Trees currently is harboring a large population of youngsters who love to submit....for lack of a better word [5]....frustrating content. 

3. We love to discuss what it means to be an adult Ent. Legalization, money, budgeting, love, etc. are big topics here. We're real people who enjoy the trees, not turd burgulars that OMFG I GOT SOOOOO HIGH LAST WEEKEND. We talk about socializing in the real world as marijuana enthusiasts.

I'm frustrated with the sexism in /r/trees. It's nothing new, where people are free from the hate and petty squabbles you might find in other subreddits. Often, I'll see someone say something like ""chill man, /r/trees is about the love."" Well, I'm not seeing much love for entwives. 

I've decided to start reporting the sexist comments. Even if the comments don't break the subreddit's guidelines

&gt;Hello lovely moderators
&gt;
&gt;I am concerned by the tolerance for sexism and misogyny in /r/trees. Whenever women are shown in a picture, and misogynistic slurs (cunt, bitch, twat, etc). 
&gt;
&gt;Can we see some action from the mods? For a 'peaceful' and chill subreddit

Is there something else we can do as a community? What do you do when you see a sexist comment on /r/trees?

1. Slept in until 11
2. Took care of some stuff that needed attending to (finally..)
3. Made breakfast with my man (college student and we really splurged--bacon, cinnamon rolls..)
4. Been kind of bummed for the past couple of days. A good friend of mine recently passed away and I'm all out of whack because of it. So
5. Boyfriend has kind of given me my space
6. Ended up smoking and having the best sex and orgasm that I've ever had in my life. Literally. 
7. Not sad anymore.

My son who is 5 1/2 is high functioning autistic. His name is Charlie. This past year he has made leaps and bounds and is doing amazing. This past week he has really started to come into his own and really show he has an opinion. Yesterday while getting ready to take him to his summer camp- Farm school- I put his things in a new tote I had made for him. He looked at me and said ""mom, just like the other kids."" And the flood gates opened and I did the happy cry while telling him sure and zipping up his bag. 

This was an amazing thing to experience and when I told my husband he teared up a little and told Charlie what a cool kid he was. So tonight I am laying in bed

Charlie: Dad
Husband: What is it buddy?
Charlie: What's your favorite color?
Husband: I like Blue.
Charlie: why?
Husband: I don't know
Charlie: Dad
Husband: Anything mom makes! I like it all! 
Charlie: But what?
Husband: (names off several dishes) What's your favorite Charlie?
Charlie: Muffins!

OMG ladies!!!! OMG!!!! This is THE first ever full on conversation we have ever had with Charlie. This is the first moment he has EVER asked a personal question. He has never asked or done anything like this before. I am laying in bed just crying,False,self,t5_2s7a6,1371614357.0,,,t3_1gmtc9

Well, amongst fifteen male comics, many of whom were professionals. And I still have no idea how, but I ended up totally rocking the performance.
After the show, I WON FIRST PLACE! Now I'm off to the finals next week and I have a chance at winning 500 dollars! My newspaper wrote an article about me, and I hosted an open mic night at another comedy club.
Never had I ever dreamed that I could be funny enough to be a standup comic! And now in such a short amount of time, I seem to be doing it.

The suffix ""-wife"" is meant to imply a curation role, which they then passed on to the children of Arda. Ents protected plants by being physical defenders, while Entwives protected them by making elves and men see how useful plants could be if properly cared for.

*""Treebeard says that the Entwives began to move farther away from the Ents because they liked to plant and control things, although the male Ents still visited them. The Entwives, unlike the Ents, interacted with the race of Men and taught them much about the art of agriculture.*

Apparently the male Ents and female Entwives exhibited a marked degree of sexual dimorphism; the male Ents all resemble wild forest trees that they guard (oaks, but the Entwives guarded agricultural plants, and it would thus seem to be implied that they resembled the various agricultural plants and trees they guarded: Treebeard remarks that their hair was the hue of ripe corn (grain).

*The Entwives lived in peace until their gardens were destroyed by Sauron, Treebeard implored the Hobbits not to forget to send word to him if they ""hear any news"" of the Entwives ""in your land"".""*

I had mentioned that we had some stress in our lives, our anniversary and trip were pretty sad. We came home a day early. When we got home from the beach the doctor admitted my boyfriend to the hospital for 4 days. After many tests and days of waiting they said he has testicular cancer. They released him from the hospital so that he can go to a cryogenic sperm bank, in case we want kids in the future (chemo can make you infertile). He is going to start 9 weeks of chemo on Friday. The doctor gave a very good prognosis, 90% cure rate.

I was going to visit my mom today, she took one of her pills.

She continued texting me even after she took the sleeping pill (which is always entertaining) and the last text she sent me before falling asleep asked if I happened to have any ""green stuff"" because it had been a while (since she was a teenager) but she may be willing to try it.

When I got to her house today we were joking around, and couldn't figure out what she had been talking about. I told her I assumed she meant weed, and it instantly clicked.

We sat around and talked for a little while, stop whenever she wanted, and that maybe since it had been about 30 years, she may want to just take a hit or two.

She had no problem sharing a whole bowl with me. Afterwards we went back inside, and ate a couple cookies. I got up to go to the bathroom, and when I was coming out she was standing there with a big smile on her face.

""Its gone. My pain is gone. Even my headache is gone. My body doesn't ache! Why can't this be legal?""

It made me feel awesome that I could share this with her, and I'm going to be bringing some back with me every time I visit her.

TL;DR: Mom with chronic pain who hasn't smoked in 30 years smoked with me today. She felt better than she has in years on painkillers. Smiles all around.

Entwives isn't about posting things that are ONLY related to being a female tree smoker. 

It's about US. It's about who we are. It's about our thoughts and insecurities; our hopes and fears; our successes and failures; our dreams and nightmares; our proud moments and disappointments. It's about finding like-minded people to discuss daily life with and knowing that when you come here it won't be judged.

We did everything we could to get him better but he was just too far sick to bring back so I made his passing as easy for him as I possibly could. 

I've been heart broken, it was a present for my boyfriend's mother (it's her birthday tonight) but she had no place big enough to put her and so she had my boyfriend come surprise me with [her](http://imgur.com/TSiDS).

So we broke up. And for two days I cried and barely ate.

But then something occurred to me. He ended things because he knew I would never want what he did. I would have done the same thing. I realized that our friendship was always the main focus of our relationship. That would never change.

So I went on a date with a very nice man who also does not want kids (POF really delivered in this case) and there was no anxiety or emotional baggage.

Monday my boss pulls me aside and tells me that they received a complaint from her about not being charged enough for asparagus or some apples (conventional vs. organic prices). I tell my boss the story and that I don't remember anything being said about the apples, so I wasn't that concerned and just thought it was pretty funny that a customer actually complained about not being charged enough at a place that is frequently referred to as Whole Paycheck. 

Yesterday my boss has me log off my register early because the complaint was sent to store management and they want me to write a statement about what happened. After I hand it in I ask if I'm going to be written up and he tells me he doesn't know what they plan to do. 

I used to work in a different department where the boss hated me and wrote me up for some complete bullshit that put me on a final warning. This means if I get written up before June I lose my job. There's nothing I can do to defend myself against this.

So I turned 23 yesterday. I've had a hard childhood and birthdays haven't been important to me, so I understood and wasn't too upset. 22nd bday, he had to go to orientation at his new college, so that was fine. 23rd bday, we're living together now, are kind of in a bad situation (both unemployed, just trying to get on our feet). So, cotton candy hookah tobacco

So we go and get these, and tend to get a little offended when people tell me how I should be living my life. HE has the tendency to channel his father during talks and comes across as very condescending. Basically, ""you're 23 now, what are you doing with your life, you have no goals"". Which I do. I stated ""I've always been a very independent person"", and he responds, without missing a beat, but I didn't know what he wanted me to do RIGHT THEN to make him fucking satisfied. All I wanted to do for THIS NIGHT IN PARTICULAR was to ENJOY myself. 

That ruined EVERYTHING. 

I was sick was anger and refused dinner to go take a long bath to unwind. Didn't help much. Smoked a bowl with my ent while pretty much ignoring him, alcohol, pie, and movies was nonexistent. Now I'm here crying, finally releasing my frustration. I was up until about 3-4 upset, trying to read and fall asleep. I know he feels bad but I don't think he realizes how much he hurt me.

So thanks, and helping me naturally work through my trust issues (learning to trust my ent will take care of things so I don't need to worry/can relax). I'm pretty sure I'd end up a lonely old biddy and an angry, alienating workaholic without trees to help me see things in a broader perspective!

I weighed in today at 282 lbs. 

Only my doctor knows how much I really weigh and I don't want to know what people's reactions would be if I told them. This is probably the heaviest I've been in years. About 10 years ago I was almost to 290. The silver lining was that I was told that I had an underactive thyroid and was put on some medication to level it out. I lost about 20 lbs in the next 6 months and then slowly got down to 250 in the next 7 years.  In the past year I slowly started putting it back on and in the past 6 months alone I've put on 20 and finally weighed in at my current 282 at the doctor's office today. When she brought up the option of bariatric surgery (as a last resort if I'm not able to do this on my own) I almost broke down crying right there in the office

I feel embarrassed and disgusted with myself. I know all of the right things to do but I'm lazy and I like food

So here I sat most of the day since getting home from the doctor

So that's my secret. If anyone is on WW and wants a buddy or even if you aren't and would like to buddy up

In October a friend and I started the first Hempology 101 Society chapter in Alberta at Medicine Hat College. I'm not sure how to put it into words

The friend who helped me start the club invited his ""cool friend"" to join when we first started up. He became the secretary

What started out as a plan for a little concert on 4/20 (our very conservative city's first 4/20 event in years) has turned into a gigantic multi-genre benefit concert with sponsors coming out of the woodwork.

My favourite local punk band has agreed to make our show, now I'm talking to them like an events director while I try to hold in my fangirl squeak..

Today we got a call that there was a shipment for us at the post office... What the hell could it be? Donations and donations and donations! Thank you gifts for bands, coffee mugs, buttons, hats! We've gotten so much more support than I ever imagined! Even my mom, who doesn't entirely belive in the cause, is donating some of her homemade crafts to hand out because ""they have hemp string and hippies like that stuff"". My mother... My mother who just last summer threw a shitfit upon learning I toke.

I finally feel like I'm helping. Even if it's just the fact that I'm finally giving the cannabis enthusiasts of Medicine Hat

The forms are filled out, everything is legal as fuck. T- 15 days and counting.

[Here](http://m.facebook.com/events/419095878170816) is the link to the Facebook event page if anyone would like to check it out. I'm proud of this

he ws 30 years old. my only sibling, and even a failed attempt. I live 3000 miles away from him and my parents, and was never told any of this was going on.
my parents found him on the floor of the bathroom. he had killed himself by overdosing on heroin, the neighbor threw a newport pack over the fence, with heroin, and needles. (all of this was in the phone, and the box and needle was next to him) cops dont care and dont feel like the dude is at fault.
im broken. im going through the motions but nothing means much. i hate watching my kids play together bc it reminds me of us. ive tried therapy, if my child ever said things like he did, for example my mother would say, as always. ""goodnight john boy"", and she said he would reply with ""i hope i never wake up"" i dont care if hes 13 or 30. id hog time him and take him to every inpatient clinic i can find until someone took him in. she didnt. she turned a blind eye.
and a week before he died? when he called his best friend, or really do anything.
i dont know what to do. im destroyed
i just dont know how to get back to myself. if that can even happen....

It was the first time I smoked during college (after not having smoked for years :P). I was at my best friend's Roxy's apartment, so he pulls out a bowl and packs it. I had never even used one before, so I was super nervous about that. He had to light it/hold it for me and tell me what to do...So embarrassing for me! And then I ended up hacking because I had inhaled too much -- but I did get hilariously high from it. 

We talked in the kitchen for a while

I somehow got myself onto the ground

I started to get cold (which happens to me anytime I get high)

After a while, lol. Eventually, they got me to the couch with a blanket and I slept soundly for the night. :P

Dates:

Signup: Now until August 30 (may be extended if necessary)

Matching: September 1st

Must Ship By: October 1st

To Sign up:
PM me with your address (and real name if you are comfortable with sharing it and/or need it to receive packages, and whether or not you can decorate with tree-related items.  

International Shipping:
Our lovely community is mostly in the States, so please indicate if you want a domestic address (this goes for everyone, not just Americans).  I will try to do my best, but you still might get an international address.  Also remember that it might be totally rad to ship internationally, and if you want to, please indicate that as well.

What Qualifies As Decor:
Posters, rugs, magnets, art, mirrors, lamps, throw pillows, imagine Pier 1 if it was a head shop... Things can have a use

As with earlier exchanges

Please feel free to ask any questions or make any criticisms (constructive, that would be great.  Currently, I cannot participate in the exchange because it would not be fair to add myself since I would know who has me (and how awkward would it be to send my match my info and tell them to send me something!).

About a year and a half ago,"" that going to church was sort of like story time for me, and that all my Christian friends seemed like they were taking some really powerful drug I wasn't on. She cried. She prayed (of course). She took me to therapy. And then she kicked me out of the house.

Around the same time, and I think she was scared she was losing me. I'm not mad anymore, but it was a really tough time between my family and me. My parents sold my cello behind my back. It sucked. Things were said that shouldn't have been. We've since made up.

Soon, and one by one, they stopped communicating with me. I felt like, one by one, they were breaking up with me. Each time was seriously, *seriously* fucking shitty. But my then boyfriend, now fiance helped me realize that if they weren't willing to love me for who I actually am, maybe I didn't want them in my life anyway.

That said, or even if any of you all would like an extra friend. Don't get me wrong, my ent is a wonderful, wonderful friend... but sometimes I just need a *girl*friend, you know? :) I'm 25/f, from Dallas, Texas, work in the mortgage industry... and I'm really hoping I'm not as boring as I sound, Eyedea, and Tristan Prettyman is amazing

I text her after saying that smoked weed and hoped that wouldn't be a problem

Every night I went round to hers for the next few months I would bring some green and we would get high together

I would go round during the day too

I moved in to her flat about 8 months after I met her, I'd brush my teeth and freshen up before I got back to her as she couldn't stand the smell of smoke when pregnant. When we got closer to the birth I stopped smoking and we had the most beautifully perfect baby I have ever seen. 

After a few months I started smoking again, then went back to smoking every night. She wanted me to quit, I did not. We carried on. After nearly a year and a half we feel pregnant again (all that shit about green=low sperm count is bull shit) and moved house a nice big house with a massive garden.

We had another perfect little baby. Same pattern

Now for financial reasons I haven't purchased any green for a while and would be given some from my brother who would occasionally visit or from a work mate who smokes also. 

I miss when would both smoke together. 

I suggested that I could grow a single plant in our garden

I feels like this is who I am and have always been an she thinks that I should stop as she doesn't want me to be one of ""those dad's"". 

I know I can't afford to buy any more

I don't want to just stop, 8 year old, 2 year old, 4 month old) more than anything in the world and don't want to lose them. I just want to keep a little bit of me too. 

I feels snappy and argumentative when I don't smoke for a while and know in my head I'm a better calmer dad if I know I have a joint to wind down to when I've finished my day at work and got the kids to bed. 

Can I have some guidance oh wise EntWives....

I'm not really sure where else to talk about this. I know there's other subreddits I could put it in but usually when I think of support

I had already planned the next post I was going to put on here. It was going to be about how I had gotten a new job (wishful thinking

But last night, but he is okay.

He's having surgery today because his leg is broken

So now I have to go to this interview knowing that he is in pain. I would have rescheduled but he's going to be out of work for awhile and our insurance is going to go up and I'm going to need a better income to take care of us.

His family and our friends are insanely supportive, I will gladly accept them.


EDIT:
My best friend works at the store where I had the interview and he told the store manager what happened


UPDATE:
I've been at the hospital now for about 5 hours, I plan on staying in the hospital with him tonight.

ANOTHER UPDATE:
Right after I posted the last update, but he's exhausted). So his dad and I are sitting in the room waiting for the rest of the family or for him to wake up. He can sleep for the rest of the day if that's what he needs, but at least when he wakes up this time, I'll be the first face he sees. Ah! And he just woke up! Hug time, ladies thank you so much.
