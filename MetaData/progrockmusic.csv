* The *Grace for Drowning* show I went to in Seattle was visually one of the best shows I've been to. Do you have a similar setup planned for *The Raven that Refused to Sing*?
* Do you plan on doing anymore cameos in Opeth songs?
* Which artists do you pull most inspiration from?
* Which female vocalists have earned your utmost respect?
* How do you feel album artwork relates to the album as a whole? Are they connected? Is it as important as the music?

I'm crossing my fingers that Steven will catch wind of the AMA! :)

* Jethro Tull was an enigmatic little British group.  How did their sound evolve from the pure jazz and blues of *This Was* to the bombastic, evocative sound of ***Thick as a Brick***?

* Are there any moments on the album you consider particularly strong or particularly weak (i.e.

* The album (song) reached #1 on the Billboard Top 100 charts

That brings me to my second point. These guys did not stop playing. With such demanding material I would have been satisfied at 1.5 hours.  Every band member was on top of their game and having fun through the entire 2 and a half hour set. 

Last two times I saw Steven he was quite reserved and calm, more intimate. 

Finally, I was astonished by all of them.  I really hope they release a DVD of this show so that I have the opportunity to appreciate them all.

This is more to do with recent trends in digital music, Six Degrees, The Whirlwind, Fly From Here, etc.? Do you prefer this set up for ease of navigation to your favorite parts, or does it taint the listening experience? 

Which leads me to ask

Going into the history of the genre, or is the genre so inundated that it turns you off thinking of potentially wasting 20 or 30 minutes of your time?

Also, all I ask is that, if you can, please link so we can all share your enjoyment! Depending on how much activity this gets, I may go through and make playlists of peoples' submissions (on Youtube/Grooveshark/Spotify) and post them here. ",,False,t5_2s6xc,True

I'm really happy with the direction this subreddit has taken in the last few weeks. There's a lot of new material and new bands I hadn't heard before. Keep 'em coming! It's a real joy to listen to them all.  

Now for the challenge, with a lot of atmosphere.  

Here are some examples of what I'm talking about :

[Twilight Coda - Steven Wilson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lESrGes0iFI)   
[Drag Ropes - Storm Corrosion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=manW5v-AR7U)  

Songs that could go well with [pictures like these](http://imgur.com/a/vdLZg#0). The spookier the better.  
I'm looking forward to your suggestions! Keep (prog)rockin and have fun!

I'm going to try to keep it on the more obscure side, so I won't post Genesis or other 70s bands that everyone knows already.

* Amplifier http://amplifier.bandcamp.com/album/eternity
This isn't my very favorite

* Anamanaguchi http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GItw1qZLdsU
It's super fun chiptune, and the songs tend to actually go somewhere.

* Big Big Train http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfCMX6iMcZM and http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thcsMCWBZQU
This is pretty unabashedly prog. I find it to be quality stuff. The whole album (The Underfall Yard) is good

* Children of Nova http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJB2jqToa2E
If you're a fan of frenetic Mars Volta type stuff

* Cloudkicker http://cloudkicker.bandcamp.com/album/the-discovery
Post metal made by one dude. Got some free stuff on bandcamp

* The Dear Hunter http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoAtvzImzGY&amp;ob=av2e This is about a good a start as any

* Gregor Samsa http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IulAE9BGoc
Really soft post-rock

* Mew http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqY4f45SKqY Kind of poppy prog. I've listened to Frengers quite a bit.

* Minus the Bear http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xo8mU8wWdSA Gets pretty mathy at times. I prefer when this song is immediately followed by part 2

* Oceansize http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lz2wE3zf2ew and http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSrLxpUHUJQ and http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzDNPVGVBXw
Seriously

* Porcupine Tree's earlier stuff. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYkT7ZK4OdA or http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11TgfNz53SI or http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enMaGDI7WGg
I know everyone's heard of Porcupine Tree, its just a remaster with real drums. Very good.)

* Pure Reason Revolution http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTwa3TTHNA It's pretty good. Not my very favorite but it has fans. Worth checking out.

* Sigur Ros http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAA3KF-VBac Very good post-rock. Also gets weird and dense. Lots of singing in Icelandic. Already pretty popular

* Stemage http://stemage.bandcamp.com This guy makes some cool tracks (the Strati parts on the Strati album are particularly cool) and he also is the guy who does Metroid Metal www.metroidmetal.com which is also some high quality stuff.

* Steven Wilson http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kc7Q63P2jGQ In case you haven't heard this album yet

* The Tangent http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voJQh4vmXXY or http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcUUPVSR_6s This is SOMEHOW not cheesy to me. I won't judge you if you think it is. But give it a shot.

* Time Columns http://timecolumns.bandcamp.com/album/sunriseinthesea-ep It's a guy on drums and a guy on guitar with a loop pedal. It's pretty surprising how much sound they make. Very mathy.

* Von Hertzen Brothers http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObToIMSqmlg I really like this album. Lots of sounds. Video is a bit silly for some reason IMO. Music is still really good.

1. First listen: usually an undifferentiated mass of notes and instrumental lines. I get a feel of the overall style. This is where I am with Pain of Salvation's The Perfect Element. 

2. One or two songs differentiate that I start looking forward to when they come around.  This where I am with Transatlantic's Whirlwind.

3. More songs differentiate until (hopefully) just about everything on the CD is kick-ass.  Some lyrics start to become understandable. (It's not a matter of clarity - it's more when my brain begins to pay attention. ) It is now the best thing evar! This is where I am with Devin Townsend's Epicloud

4. Lyrics and story kick in

5. Graduation to personal classic. I pull it out regularly, Tull - Thick as a Brick, Dream Theater - Awake and Scenes from a Memory, Yes - Going for the One and Yessongs, etc.

**These threads can be made by anyone and should be posted every 2-4 days; that way this theme can be lengthened for a few months at least. Also

A few rules first:  
1) **Consistant Formatting** - Just to make things easier
2) **Don't repost artists** - Please read through the thread so you don't mention an artist that's already been said  
3) **Only downvote irrelevant comments** - Don't downvote comments just because you don't like the artists
4) **Try to limit your posts in each thread** - It isn't a contest of your extensive knowledge of prog
  
Keep it civil

Mine would have to be King Crimson. For starter's, making them groundbreaking at the time. They blended together the heaviness of rock, improvisation of jazz and even some classical, to create a sound that was wholly unique. Take for instance, the opening track of ITCOTCK: 21st Century Schizoid Man. Also, they weren't a one trick pony: this is what follows the former track; notice the beautiful contrast. My favorite song of theirs; which is as this guy notes also happens to be written in sonata form, is a culmination of a lot of the things I just mentioned. They were also ever evolving.
