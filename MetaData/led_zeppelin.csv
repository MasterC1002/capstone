I am currently 28.  As a die hard Led Zeppelin fan

Some of you may remember that the only way to get tickets for this event was with a code.  20 million people applied for codes and there were only 20 thousand seats which means only about 10 thousand codes were given out.  **I did not get a code.**

I found out through a few websites when codes would be e-mailed out and when I realized that non of my friends nor I received a code

Once I received the e-mail with the code

Living in New York at the time

On the day of the show, I had numerous people offer me cash for my tickets and my place in line.  The highest offer was about $20,000.  To this day I don't regret turning him down despite that being close to a year's salary.

After waiting in line all day with some new friends from all around the world

Total cost (tickets, hostel) - $1200 each

**09/09/2012 - The 'FOUR' image** 

[This image](http://twitter.com/ledzeppelin/status/244800351721631745/photo/1) was posted exactly 24 hours after [the 'FIVE' image](http://twitter.com/ledzeppelin/status/244437971380621314/photo/1)

**09/09/2012 - The second Peter Mensch tweet**
&gt;it's almost here. I've seen it and heard it. almost 5 years to the day.

[This tweet](http://twitter.com/maindepowr/status/244574934775513091) from Led Zeppelin manager Peter Mensch alludes to the five year anniversary of the O2 show, as the concert was on the 10th of that month. Reliability rating of 9/10, he never explicitly states what he is referring to, but us fans know that it is coming. 'I've seen it and heard it' is presumed to refer to the O2 show being released on both DVD and CD.

**08/09/2012 - The 'FIVE' image** 

[This image](http://twitter.com/ledzeppelin/status/244437971380621314/photo/1) was posted on both [the band's official Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/ledzeppelin) and [the day-old Twitter account](http://twitter.com/ledzeppelin). No description was provided. Judging from the evidence shown above, five days from the posting of the image. This image receives a reliability rating of 9/10. It was posted on official channels, and is the clearest indicator yet of an upcoming release. 

**07/09/2012 - The reactivation of the Led Zeppelin Facebook and Twitter.** 

The official Led Zeppelin Facebook page posted [this cryptic one-word update](https://www.facebook.com/ledzeppelin/posts/379653788773732) This is significant as there has been no activity since March. Couple this with the fact that [the Led Zeppelin Twitter account](https://twitter.com/ledzeppelin) went live, as a hashtag makes it easier to keep track of news. Also note that confirmation of the Twitter account going live was posted on a thread on the official Led Zeppelin forum about the possibility of an O2 show DVD release in November, by the site webmaster, who had clearly been monitoring the thread. I give these a reliability rating of 9/10 as they clearly hint at something Zep coming soon.

**04/09/2012 - The Belgian news article.**

[This article](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:4GwPWMTqOS0J:www.rtbf.be/classic21/article_le-live-2007-de-led-zep-bientot-en-dvd%3Fid%3D7832707+&amp;cd=2&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=uk) appeared on the site of a state-owned Belgian radio station, a reliable source of information. Shortly after it was posted the author's name was removed, now the article itself has been removed. I give this a reliability rating of 3/10, no links to sources were given, and this article alone doesn't give any evidence.

**25/07/2012 - The Eddie Trunk tweet.** 
&gt;Heard from a very reliable source backstage at Aerosmith show that there will be some sort of Led Zeppelin activity around Christmas...

[This tweet](https://twitter.com/EddieTrunk/status/228294343281217536) from US radio host Eddie Trunk confirms some Led Zeppelin 'activity' happening later on in the year. Who is his 'very reliable source'? Well the likeliest option is Ross Halfin

**09/07/2012 - The Peter Mensch tweet.** 
&gt;today

[This tweet](https://twitter.com/maindepowr/status/222531923237552128) from Led Zeppelin/Jimmy Page manager Peter Mensch explains that the O2 show is being mixed by Alan Moulder

1353192704.0,13dedk,Best version of No Quarter EVER,andheartsjaz,29,3,9,"“No Quarter” Led Zeppelin —From “For Badgeholders Only” Bootleg album

This has probably got to be one of the most dynamic, epic classical-jazz-blues-rock jams I’ve heard by them. Warning, its 31 minutes but worth every second. John Paul Jones is a GENIUS. Jimmy’s playing is fucking incredible. John’s beats are fantastic and Robert is on point. Also loved how much recognition he gave JPJ :D.

I couldn't let myself find ""For Badgeholders Only Bootleg"" and not share it with fellow Led Heads :P Please enjoy and share with other true fans :]

1356750309.0,15ludm,The case for Presence ,,25,1,15,"Now before I talk about Presence I want to say that I don't think it's quite as good as the 6 first albums and there are more noticeable flaws with it. It also doesn't do many new things here either and most songs probably won't blow your mind except for Achilles Last Stand. It also the least dynamic Led Zeppelin album which may turn some people away and it's very stripped down compared to Physical Graffiti. 
Still after those criticism I actually think that time may still be kind to Presence as it was to Led Zeppelin III (not to the same extend though). 

First two out of the seven songs are just terrific

Presence is actually the Led Zeppelin studio album that sold the least (not counting coda) and I can sort of see why since it was released one year after PG and the same year as The Song Remains The Same. But really I don't see why this album isn't more popular. Sure

Presence is in my opinion a great album and while it may have it's flaws it deserves a better reputation. I think it gets compared to their earlier work which makes the album seem more flawed than it actually is. When Presence peaks it's some of the best stuff Zeppelin ever done and even when at it's worst it's still better than some of the stuff on ITTOD. This is all my opinion of course

TL;DR: I think Presence deserves to get more praise and recognition even though I don't think it's quite as amazing as their earlier work.

I've been collecting Led Zeppelin bootleg copies of Led Zeppelin for 25 years. To this day, the sound quality is sometimes very good.

During all those years
I've browsed the web for similar projects but

What we should end up with is a playlist for a virtual collection of live Led Zeppelin tracks. We coud even consider making 2 playlists: 1 for soundboard tapes

The aim of this project is NOT to promote bootleg recordings. I don't buy bootlegs anymore and wouldn't recommend to do so. But as many boots are available on the Internet and a lot of people collected them from the seventies
Needless to say

Here are a few rules I think we should follow:

* No selection of tracks from official releases;
* EDIT: No tracks with cuts and/or fades;
* One post per song and type of bootleg (soundboard/audience);
* Post should be titled like this: *[LZBLV][SBD] No Quarter* (LZBLV stands for ""Led Zeppelin Best Live Version""
* Comments should be formatted like this: *1975-03-19 - Vancouver
* Don't post anything if you only listened to a small amount of live versions.

1348597627.0,10gnsn,Why exactly do you like Led Zeppelin? What is it about them that draws your attention?,ghost20063,22,2,30,"I like Led Zeppelin for two main reasons:

1 I genuinely enjoy the music they make. While the four of them may or may not be the best in the world in their individual talents (vocals, drums), the things that they do together (from subtle to obvious) are amazing.

2 I enjoy visualizing Led Zeppelin as actual gods that come down from some heavenly abode to release albums or play shows. This is an aura that I think they give off in how extravagantly they lived and the topics of the songs they put out e.g. Stairway, Battle of Evermore, Kashmir, and Ramble On to name a few.

Here's a list of some of those subtle things I spoke about:
Rock and Roll: Listen to solo but specifically this lick here at 2:07-2:11
Stairway to Heaven: Drums at 6:21-6:24
All of JPJ's bass playing in The Lemon Song (I wanted to cut it down to part where it's just him and Bonham's drum playing but I can't justify that)

The idea is to post all of Zeppelin released songs cronollogically as well as some quick guidelines to comment on them. Commentary

This will hopefully spark some fine discussion amongst all the subscribers

Feedback is highly appreciated, complaint, whatever you want.

I gain no karma in this

Thank you and I hope you all take part in this!

1352553294.0,12ymtm,Celebration Day 2 disc version to include the FULL rehearsal footage,Cookie0024,9,0,1,"In an interview for Ultimate Classic Rock

&gt;The whole rehearsal – start to finish. A lot of people are just going to be so very, it was sort of a dress runthrough and it was decided that they were going to play the whole set from start to finish with no interruption. So I just stuck a camera, not quite a full professional camera, on a tripod next to me, for a wide shot. I think it was like, “Yeah, we want to look at this afterward, “Well, some bits around the O2

&gt;We had this one copy of the rehearsal, of which there was only an existing stereo mix and matched it up. There was discussions about, “Well, you know it could be four or five songs — let’s listen to it and see if it’s any good.” And then the idea gradually emerged amongst the band and everybody – you know it wasn’t a slam dunk, as you might say, it was more like, “What if we put the whole thing on?” And I said, that would be amazing. That would be truly amazing, confident — it would just be an amazing thing for fans

&gt;It would mean that it definitely wouldn’t fit on one DVD, let’s do it. There was a period of time when it wasn’t definite and in the end, everybody said, “Hell, let’s just do it — as a gesture to the fans.” And really, understanding how it sits in counterpoint to the main concert, because of course, we spent months and months working on editing and getting everything just right. The rehearsal

&gt;It’s brilliant and of course, but also totally different at the same point in time. There are some beautiful moments in that rehearsal where Robert shouts out, “Hey! Hey! Are we recording this?” and Mick [sound engineer “Big” Mick Hughes, well known for his years of working for Metallica] yells, “Yeah!” and Robert says, “Fantastic!” There are some great moments in the rehearsal in between the songs as well.
