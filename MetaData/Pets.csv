1329667122.0,pwhyn,"""Stop listening to stupid people on the internet."" My vet's response to reddit.",outhere,731,129,226,"Not long ago I posted a picture titled

Really?  For giving my dogs the occasional piece of hot dog as a treat?  I wonder what you would think of me when I let my children eat a Hershey kiss.

Most of the comments went way overboard.  Most of the comments were downright misleading and uninformed. (“You are killing your dogs”) How do I know this?  Because I consulted my vet after I read the posts. The over-blown responses sounded more like PETA that reddit. My vet rolled his eyes and told me, but treats are virtually insignificant. “Just like humans.” He said.

So I did a bit of research and found that the probability of a large dog getting pancreatitis from eating two grape-size pieces of hot dog every day for 5 years straight is less than 2% higher than a dog that eats specially formulated dog foods and nothing else.  By comparison

The fact is,000 years, but food made specifically for dogs has only been around for a bit over 100 years. Even then, dog nutrition has only been studied and applied to dog food for about 50 years.  What did people feed dogs for the first 9900 years?  Scraps, fat, lard, stale bread, an overwhelmingly fatty diet.

Being a dog owner means giving your dog a good life.  A good life means being flexible and reasonable, I’m not going to worry about it at all.  But I guarantee I won’t tell reddit about it – too many knee-jerk reactions by uninformed people.

1359921754.0,17tlmt,I am shocked... and disgusted.. by what I'm seeing.,gnosticpostulant,663,105,139,"I just found this subreddit after seeing a related post in /r/veterinary. So I came over

In one post

I have worked in an emergency animal hospital for 3 years (not quite new to it

1.) If an animal's nose is dry

2.) DO NOT give your animal aspirin, and it can build up quickly and cause toxic reactions... liver failure, kidney failure, bleeding ulcers, neurotoxicity... etc., etc.

3.) DO NOT induce vomiting at home with hydrogen peroxide or salt without having previously been given a dose by a vet. Hydrogen peroxide can lead to gastroenteritis because it irritates the lining of the stomach and intestines as it goes through. Giving salt can cause sodium toxicity and lead to kidney failure and heart problems.

4.) There are no respiratory illnesses that can be passed to or from cats and dogs to humans. If you had the flu last week and now your cat is sneezing, fleas, or ringworm, use good hygiene to protect yourself. Do not directly handle feces or urine at any time, and if you are exposed... wash your hands before you do anything else.

5.) If your dog is eating the cat food, expect constipation. If your cat eats ONLY dog food, expect to find him at the vet with blindness or heart problems due to taurine deficiency.

6.) If your animal eats any of the following, sugar-free gum or any product with xylitol, grapes, raisins, chocolate, coffee/espresso/cappucino beans/grounds. The list goes on, but those are the major ones we frequently see.

7.) Marijuana is toxic to dogs and cats!! Do not be afraid to tell your vet that your animal may have ingested it... they will not report you to the police. We just need to know what your pet ingested so we can treat it correctly. Marijuana toxicity has a very specific set of symptoms and we likely already know

8.) A seizure lasting longer than 5 minutes needs to be seen by a vet immediately

9.) Animals are not little people! It doesn't matter how well they know you, or hurt, they will lash out to protect themselves. 

10.) Going back to things we feed our animals, cake (yes, seen it)... to cats and dogs has a chance of causing a wonderful condition called pancreatitis... days of hospitalization with IV fluids and meds. If you want to give your animals a treat, try green beans... they love them and it's good for them.

11.) If your animal has been vomiting for more than 24 hours

I'll edit if I think of anything else, think before you give things to your animal or follow the advice of unqualified people.

EDIT: To be clear with everyone, you have no proof that I am a Vet Tech.

If you have questions concerning medical situations or nutrition, is toxic, consult your vet or the APSCA Poison Control center.",,False,,t5_2qh6o,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/17tlmt/i_am_shocked_and_disgusted_by_what_im_seeing/

My case had a much more innocent

A word about my family: We are like you. Normal everyday people. I'm an electrician, our 7 year old German shepherd that we rescued in 2007. He was our first and only dog as a couple, and has been wonderful with our three kids.

Now to the story. It started in a way over the fourth of july weekend. My buddies and I did our annual ""guys only"" camping trip. I left Gunther home to ""guard"" the family. My wife said he paced the house while I was gone and seemed rather ticked that I left for two days without him. When I got home I parked the Suburban with all the camping gear in the driveway where it stayed all week. I was too exhausted that day to unload it then work kept me busy all week. (The suburban is our old extra vehicle that only gets used for camping trips and Home Depot runs). I know Gunther saw the suburban and he knew that he had missed out on a camping trip

Fast forward to this last Saturday morning. I got up around 9 and decided to take care of the camping stuff. Gunther was still inside and didn't seem too eager to go out, organized a few things in the garage then went out and shut the door on the suburban, and closed the gate.

An hour later

He didn't come in when I called him and I saw his food was untouched. I checked every corner of the yard and called him for ten minutes. It wouldn't be the first time he decided he wanted to stay out on a nice night, I determined he WAS NOT in the yard. Suddenly I realized the gate had been open this morning, and he must have slipped by me. Looking back I cant believe I didn't think of the other alternative right then, but in my mind, he HAD to have left the yard. My wife called all the neighbors we know and put the kids to bed while I scoured the neighborhood. I gave up around midnight. He has gone on such escapades twice before, so I knew he would come back.

I picked up my search in the morning, and I'd have to spring him in the morning. I had a nagging feeling though that they would have called me as he is tagged and chipped.

So finally, and I threw my hands up in frustration. I was starting to think someone had taken him. I walked into the yard and just started poking around, more slowly to see if there was anything I could have missed, like blood or footprints. I was getting THAT desperate!

As I rounded the back of the garage I came face to face with the grill of the suburban and the answer to where Gunther was hit me like a bullet to the chest. A chill washed over my body and I stood there for a moment, because I knew at that moment that Gunther being inside wasn't a sure thing until I looked. It was like I wanted to NOT look so I could still hope he had just run off. Then I saw tongue marks on the windshield. 

I bolted over to the door, stepped back and slammed the door. I hadn't seen him, but 36 hours in record temps had already gone to work on him. I knew he was in there.

I broke down in the backyard all by myself. My wife was feeding the baby while the other two kids were napping. It took me 15 minutes to go inside

We called my parents

We wrapped him in a blanket and used my dad's pickup to take him to my childhood home in the country

I filed a report with the police. Its a small town. The cop knew me from high school. He was understanding

The suburban has been sitting open for three days. I don't dare even go on that side of the house right now. My kids are devastated

I'd like to add some pearls of wisdom or say some inspiring shit about what a great dog Gunther was

Tl;dr......Check your backseat even if you DIDN'T take your dog anywhere. He may just THINK you are going on a car ride.

EDIT: Thank you all for the kind words. I can see starting a throw away account was an unnecessary step. I honestly feared for my safety if people knew what happend. My family and facebook friends think we found him on the side of the road

We are taking my 4 year old to the grave to help her better understand where Gunther is and why he isn't coming back. I've prepared some words so we can have a little graveside service.

Telling this story has had mixed results with my current emotional status. I'm not as angry with MYSELF

I can't respond to every comment

After a few months of this, Thumper was to become mine. This docile rabbit changed my dad's life. After re-naming him Mocho (like Mocha, but masculineified (I was 13)), my dad began to open up to this little rabbit. When he would come home from work at 3 in the morning, Mocho would always leap laps around his small cage in excitement for the treat he knew he was going to get. When he was let out, he was happy to cuddle up against your feet.

My dad then started to wonder why this sweet little rabbit had to live in such a small home. So we made a plan, allowed ample room for this tiny furball to run around in. But he was a social creature, and my dad knew it. So, after searching the internet for a breeder, I was able to convince my dad to let us adopt a pair of twin doe's; whom we later named Latte and Decaf. The Twins are nearly identical. My dad and I are the only two that can tell them apart.

After getting Mocho neutered and letting the girls mature a bit, relaying some cute thing that one of The Twins did, or some cute new sound that Mocho made. Eventually he started to identify the body positions and sounds of the rabbits, and can now communicate on a basic level with the three of them. A man who was alone in the world and had no one to welcome him home.... was changed into a man who always had creatures that were ready to cuddle at any moment. He always had 3 rabbits jumping in excitement whenever he came home. Now, no matter how hard he would try, my dad never felt the bitter sting of true loneliness again.

5 years ago, and until school was over. She would follow me all over the small town we lived in. She was terrified of nearly everyone... except me. Slowly I worked with her to get her better with people, and we got closer. 
One day, they took her away from me. No pictures, no reasons, no viable proof. They came a few months later and made me sign her for adoption. When I said that I didn't understand, that I never would have done anything to hurt her, they said ""Who will they believe, you or the police."" Young and hoping somehow i could adopt her back
Not too long ago, and she sent me this picture, a recent fully grown picture of the dog who captured my heart. 
The whole police thing is still fishy... she had worked at the humane society, well, and happy. Just wanted to share with you guys :)

Been a lurker for a while but something has been happening where I work all the time and I feel like I finally had to say something. I like to think this is something people need to be taught about and if they knew what they was doing they would change. Maybe that's a stupid hope because most people are selfish and don't care about how their action affect the world. 
People have this mentality *""Someone else will take care of it""* or *""It's not my problem""*. You live on the earth

I work at a animal shelter where we take in strays and owner surrender pets. I love working here (for the most part) and seeing happy endings. Unfortunately a lot of the time I run across people who are the absolute scum of the earth and makes me doubt the good in the world. 

You want to know how kind or unkind a person is? Look at how they treat their animals. Their true colors come out then.

Where I work, female pits who can't breed anymore into our yard. That accounts for about half our strays that comes in. **It f-ing disgusting what people will do for money. **

You wouldn't believe how many people will bring in animals they have had for years and won't blink an eye to dump them on us, for males it might make them less aggressive and females less annoying) and now days you don't even have to wait until they are 6 months old. We spay and neuter pets when the are about 2 months. They never know what they are missing and they don't have to deal with the possibility of starving on the streets with kittens or puppies. Its not just my opinion, the American Humane Society has this article you can read [here] (http://www.americanhumane.org/animals/stop-animal-abuse/fact-sheets/juvenile-spay-neuter.html). 

You wouldn't believe how many times animal control has picked up puppies and kittens from a dumpster. People THROW away their pets like garbage. It happens here ALL THE TIME!

Also when you adopt a pet, stay, not jump on people, go to the bathroom outside. You have to teach them! People adopt from us and then a month later bring the pet back a month later, because of the stupidest stuff...such as.. the cat is scratching up my furniture, the dog won't stop barking, the puppy got bigger than I thought, I just put hardwood floor down and I don't want the dog to scratch it (heard that excuse more than once). I don't say anything I just take the animal back but when they say this.. ""Can I exchange the animal for another that will work better?"" it takes all my will not to leap across the counter and strangle them. **This is not fucking Wal-Mart people. Pet's are not products that can be brought back if they are ""defective"". **
Also! This is a major ALSO for me.... if you are going to adopt a pet...do not assume the animal will be better if it is brought from a breeder!  Mutts are way healthier and have less health issues than a purebred. I am not just saying that, occurrences of certain types of cancers, things like that. Mutts are for the most part, expressing dominant genes, which for the most part are good. Not always but most of the time. Don't buy a pet from  the pet store.. I know they look all cute and perfect but think where they came from... puppies and kitten mills. I have been in one a couple times and it is sick. You don't believe me? Google it. You will want to vomit and take a shower. 
I think I got some of my suppressed anger out and I hope I educated at least one person. Feel free to ask questions or if you feel like I misspoke about something
I found this link and this is what people tell me all the time why they are giving up their animals

Nothing. Nothing... Nothing for over a week. I had put up a post on Facebook that was shared by a decent amount of my friends and their friends as well as an ad on craigslist

Last night at about 6 o'clock, and was pretty sure it was him. She found my number on craigslist. Craigslist. I couldn't believe it. So today I called up the animal shelter where she thought he might have been taken. They had him. My baby was coming home. And home he is.

During my search, all the way to the complex where he was eventually picked up. I found out that a stranger would go out of her way to call me and tell me where my dog was. I wouldn't have my best friend back without them. 

Never lose hope. There are always people out there that will go out of their way to help. There are always good forces at work.

As soon as we realized what'd happened, there's one less than a half mile away. After taking the x-rays and feeling his abdomen, the vet said he's not in any pain and it doesn't appear to be obstructing his digestive tract, and that, at the time of the x-rays, the necklace appeared to be about to enter his colon. He's been playing with his (not biological) ""sister"" and acting, eating, but he's yet to pass the necklace. I've given him extra food last night and today to hope to get it to pass quicker. However

EDIT: [He's the one on the right in this picture.](http://i.imgur.com/NtVHq.jpg)

EDIT 2: 4:20 central time. We just got done playing, obviously. Still no poop, but they go once a day or every other day since I switched them to Innova a couple months ago. 

EDIT 3: An anticlimactic, he and his ""sister"" were begging for food like normal. He had a nice, normal poop while I was in the shower after they had eaten, and afterwards I put on a pair of rubber gloves to check it out. Success, both parts (he'd broken it into two pieces) were passed! I can now stop worrying, haha. ",,,,

So,and soft, and taken care of, me and my husband both figured she was missed. So, I called the cell number the vet's office gave me and ended up speaking with a lovely woman (a nurse who worked nights), who had been missing her dog Ellie. She came over to pick Ellie up and was all happiness and tears. I did mention that her collar with her rabies tag was much too small for her and she did say she'd been meaning to replace it, but time had gotten away from her.

I run an animal rescue, and generally hard to adopt out due to behavior, health or whatever reason. But I admit I was not quite prepared for the latest rescue I got. I've had rescued dogs before, but none that were quite this psychologically scarred or with the particular behavior problems this one came with. 

We recently took in a solid black (one of the most unpopular, and that she spent the last 8 months of her life chained up indoors and living in her own filth because none of the family would take the dogs and the owner didn't want her to get euthanized at a pound but no longer had the wherewithal to fully grasp the dog's dire need for a new home. I found out later she jumped around through a lot of homes, some with rowdy aggressive children.

When she came to us for the first few days she refused to eat. Up until recently she always acted like someone was going to harm or hit her

There were times I thought I might have to give her to another rescue

Skip forward to about a month ago. She played, or probably ever really since her old owner didn't really play with her. I'd tried to engage her in play, even with her favorite toys, she acted scared and nervous so I did not push it. Then one day I just get down at her level and pat the ground and she comes over and starts pouncing playfully and runs to get a toy. Now she likes to pick up people's socks and run after them to get you to chase her and get them back. It's funny because some people might get annoyed with dogs doing this, but because of the fact that she used to never play and thought play time was something scary or that would cause her harm, it's heart warming. I actually cried, and I knew at that point

She is also getting much better about the housebreaking issue. She has her own little dog sweater since it's winter to make going outside much warmer. We do have to crate her when we leave the house but she hasn't snuck off to potty indoors when we turn our backs in over 3 weeks (whereas she would do it quite regularly). I know crating will always have to be done even if we only had her

I normally do not like to keep animals that aren't highly unadoptable because the point of the rescue part is to place animals in forever homes. Although I do have a sanctuary for animals that just can't get adopted out, and the third owner is related to my fiance as well. I would feel bad if I put her in a home and she regressed back to not being housebroken and they brought her back because she has been through so many different homes, and that caused her to have separation anxiety. so we'll see what happens.",,False,,t5_2qh6o,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/153fvc/when_you_see_a_damaged_dog_play_for_the_first/

[Formatted version of Nugget's Story](http://nuggetthechicken.blogspot.com/2012/12/nugget-story-of-how-abused-chicken-was.html)


**Pecking Order: The story of Nugget

Nugget grew up with 3 other chickens, and Tandoori.
And when they were young

I never knew the origin of the phrase
But the words came alive when watching chickens grow up in close quarters.

As the chickens matured
Our friend Jim

Nugget was the target and they would peck
Nugget never fought back

Nugget laid down motionless as if she wasn't there.
The chickens kept attacking her as if they didn't care.

Nugget could not defend herself so Jim looked for a new home.
Maybe one with nicer chickens that would leave her alone.

So we adopted Nugget from Jim and hoped for the best.
Would she fare better with us? That was the test.

Her new coop mates had names like Uggs
We hoped she wouldn't be the new target of their tweets.

Though her neighbors were different
The chickens kept pecking at her as if it was a game.

We couldn't stand it and we built her an individual cage.
Nugget would have her own area where she could peacefully age.

She wouldn't be bothered when she wanted water or a meal.
And we hoped the wound on her neck would eventually heal.

After a few weeks we decided to let Nugget mingle.
We knew she was desperately lonely and feeling single.

But this time around Nugget seemed stronger.
We could leave her in the yard with other chickens for longer.

Nugget didn't socialize because she wasn't quite able.
But she would watch from a chair or up high on a table.

And when the chickens approached her to try to attack.
Nugget puffed herself up and would take a step back.

Everything went well for Nugget for a few weeks.
But we knew something was terribly wrong when we heard shouting from their beaks.

Somehow or another a dog had entered our yard.
And his target was the chicken who was most mentally scarred.

By the time we got outside we saw.
A mean dog running with Nugget firmly in its jaw.

My daughter cried and said why Nugget - she had lived the hardest life.
I watched in horror

I put my daughter in the house and locked her in.
Then I searched for the dog who had attacked our chicken.

I found the dog with Nugget motionless by its side.
To be honest I didn't know what to do and I was terrified.

Suddenly an amazing thing happened that I didn't believe.
Nugget stood up and started running. But I was only partially relieved.

The dog tried to chase after Nugget but I kept him at bay.
I tried to give Nugget time to get away.

I searched all over the yard but Nugget was lost.
But I kept looking and I would find her at any cost.

I imagined finding her dead and my stomach sickened.
But to my surprise she was at the coop talking to the other chickens.

The chickens crowded around her wanting to hear how she survived.
Nugget had learned to play dead in order to stay alive.

All of the times she laid motionless and abused against her will
in one lucky moment was her life saving skill.

We put her in a box and then drove her to the vet.
They asked for her name. Embarrassed

The doctor gave her stitches and said Nugget would be fine.
How many lives would this chicken have ...  Nine?

When we brought her back home we locked her safely away.
So she could relax and rest for the rest of the day.

She wouldn't be bothered when she wanted water or a meal.
And we hoped the wounds from the dog would eventually heal.

After several weeks we let Nugget back out into the yard.
But this time the other chickens didn't make her life hard.

It seemed the other chickens were glad to have Nugget back.
And they were in awe of her for surviving the dog attack.

Nugget played with the other chickens during the day.
But retreated to her own coop at night to get away.

One day during a rain storm
Nugget could not get in and had nowhere else to go.

Nugget went to the coop with the other chickens to stay warm.
She was alone at the bottom but she was safe from the storm.

In the morning we set Nugget free to play outside.
And we left her private coop door open to let her decide.

The next evening Nugget stayed with the other chickens again.
She slept on the second level and was fitting in with the other hens!

On the third night after the storm we looked in the coop.
Nugget had reserved the most coveted top stoop!

From then on Nugget lived with the rest of the flock.
Amazingly she was no longer the one to be mocked.

It was as if the other chickens now respected her.
And Nugget had a new-found confidence we never expected in her.

1312768343.0,jbzdo,My little man. Put down today at 7 months old.,ashsauce,107,13,51,"What do you do when someone you love is severely sick?
I only knew him for Seven months.
When I first saw him he was a little fur-ball.  He was so cute running around the pen dashing at you filling your heart with his sweet nature. We instantly fell in love with him
It seemed to us he grew bigger every day. He was our “Big boy” he was supposed to be 200 pounds someday!
At first we thought he was just hard to house train
He was taken to the vet and they suspected it being diabetes. We were shocked
Months went on and we dealt with his “Diabetes” constantly showering with him, buying rolls of paper towel like no tomorrow.
Then it was time for him to get neutered
But it wasn’t.

The test showed his liver enzymes were way too high. We had him tested for quite a few different diseases, or a liver shunt. Every option was horrific. We decided to treat for the liver shunt as it was the least expensive thing and hopefully “easiest” to treat. Other options were to have ultrasounds done to his liver to confirm a shunt, where then the only possible treatments were medication his whole life or a surgery that can only be done at the University of Saskatoon which was thousands of dollars which he would be hospitalized and would need continuous vet visits to ensure that he would be progressing. 
He was on antibiotics and Lactulose
He started to get sick again. The medication was no longer working. More blood tests were done.
They showed his body was now attacking his Red Blood Cells. His RBC was very low
Only it didn’t work.
His eyes, felt his fur, trying to make sure he was ok, making sure he was still breathing.
I woke up to him howling. I was relieved he must be better if he’s barking. I got up to find his kennel covered in vomit.  We took him out washed his paws and set the kennel bottom outside. I watched him sleep
A little while later he vomited again
We waited about an hour for the Veterinarian. After he examined him and we showed him the medications and filled him in about his medical history he gave us two options.
1.	Subcutaneous fluids for the dehydration and Zantac injection to stop him from puking. He was bleeding in his stomach from a peptic ulcer caused by the medications that’s why his vomit had been black. He would continue to bleed internally
2.	Blood transfusion. He would need one every day for at least three days. It wasn’t guaranteed to work because his body was already destroying his RBC’s so it would also most likely reject the donor cells. It was also a very lengthy and expensive procedure.
I stared at him. He was panting on the ground
We were all in the room, giving our last bit of love that we could. 
Second last needle; to sedate him. He was fully sedated after 10 to 15 minutes. We were all there for him.
It was the last needle and shortly thereafter his last breath
We love you Moose.

___________________________________________________________________________

**The first few months**

They had been up for adoption for a month before I got them, skinny, and very, very sleepy. [Here's](http://imgur.com/TNHFDqY) a picture after about a month out of the shelter, where Freyr is looking pretty good, but Loki is still looking very skinny (it was tough to get him to eat, until I switched to softening up his dry food and warming his wet food). Around this time

A few months later, since they're [best friends](http://imgur.com/IYnA3Xm). [Loki's](http://imgur.com/2J3hWro) fur had started to grow back in, and [Freyr](http://imgur.com/h93MPky) could sort-of open his eyes at this point (it took surgery to get them better than that). Their age was estimated at this point to be around 5-6 years old, but probably not much over 7. 

_____________________________________________________________________________
**Health Problems**

There are problems with adopting sick shelter cats - you have to be prepared for the possibility of several vet visits and a lot of expense. After trying several ophthalmic creams for Freyr (and almost giving up on him ever being better), [a few days after](http://i.imgur.com/yQwak.jpg), and [finally able to open his eyes!](http://i.imgur.com/Bzv41.jpg). The total cost was around $2k for the surgery.

Loki had his own health issues that are still being worked on. He seems to have an auto-immune disease that causes his nailbeds to be chronically inflamed and infected

The point here is that you have to have time/money to help sick kitties turn into happy kitties. These guys are easy and can be left alone

________________________________________________________________________
**Finally looking good!**

At this point, and went from 9 pounds lbs to 12.5 lbs. Loki wants to be a [model](http://imgur.com/hEjSi95), and is now [very very fluffy](http://imgur.com/BWFCVu5). And I was pretty excited to finally see [Freyr's eye color](http://imgur.com/wUyyQsC), but he typically just spends most of his time sleeping.

As for personality, and I definitely could never leave dry food out because they eat fast enough to make themselves sick. Outside of meals, they're both very laid-back and loving. I have two cats on top of me most nights (except when there are new guests over - then they're so excited for affection from a new person that they don't pay attention to me!). As I'm typing this, they're both curled up in little balls on the couch with me. They almost never like to be alone.

We bring the dog back into house.

LETTER FROM A SHELTER MANAGER:
Author Unknown

""I think our society needs a huge ""Wake-up"" call. ...As a shelter manager, lost, confused eyes, you would stop flagging the ads on craigslist and help these animals find homes. That puppy you just bought will most likely end up in my shelter when it's not a cute little puppy anymore. Just so you know there's a 90% chance that dog will never walk out of the shelter it's dumped at? Purebred or not! About 25% of all of the dogs that are ""owner surrenders"" or ""strays"", that come into a shelter are purebred dogs.

The most common excuses: ""We are moving and we can't take our dog (or cat)."" Really? Where are you moving too that doesn't allow pets? Or they say ""The dog got bigger than we thought it would"". How big did you think a German Shepherd would get? ""We don't have time for her"". Really? I work a 10-12 hour day and still have time for my 6 dogs! ""She's tearing up our yard"". How about making her a part of your family? They always tell me ""We just don't want to have to stress about finding a place for her we know she'll get adopted

Odds are your pet won't get adopted &amp; how stressful do you think being in a shelter is? Well, it dies. Your pet will be confined to a small run/kennel in a room with other barking or crying animals. It will have to relieve itself where it eats and sleeps. It will be depressed and it will cry constantly for the family that abandoned it. If your pet is lucky, I will have enough volunteers in that day to take him/her for a walk. If I don't, your pet won't get any attention besides having a bowl of food slid under the kennel door and the waste sprayed out of its pen with a high-powered hose. If your dog is big, black or any of the ""Bully"" breeds (pit bull, rottie, mastiff

If your dog doesn't get adopted within its 72 hours and the shelter is full, but not for long . Most dogs get very kennel protective after about a week and are destroyed for showing aggression. Even the sweetest dogs will turn in this environment. If your pet makes it over all of those hurdles chances are it will get kennel cough or an upper respiratory infection and will be destroyed because the shelter gets paid a fee to euthanize each animal and making money is better than spending money to take this animal to the vet.

Here's a little euthanasia 101 for those of you that have never witnessed a perfectly healthy, wagging their tails. Until they get to ""The Room"", every one of them freaks out and puts on the brakes when we get to the door. It must smell like death or they can feel the sad souls that are left in there, it's strange, but it happens with every one of them. Your dog or cat will be restrained, held down by 1 or 2 shelter workers depending on the size and how freaked out they are. Then a shelter worker who we call a euthanasia tech (not a vet) find a vein in the front leg and inject a lethal dose of the ""pink stuff"". Hopefully your pet doesn't panic from being restrained and jerk. I've seen the needles tear out of a leg and been covered with the resulting blood and been deafened by the yelps and screams. They all don't just ""go to sleep"", sometimes they spasm for a while, so we don't spend our funds to tranquilize the animal before injecting them with the lethal drug, we just follow what is the fastest way we can make a dollar. Shelters do not have to have a vet perform their euthanasia's so even if it takes our employee 50 pokes with a needle and 3 hours to get the vein that is what we do. Making money is the issue here not loosing money.

When it all ends

I hope that those of you who still have a beating heart and have read this are bawling your eyes out and can't get the pictures out of your head, do your homework, and know exactly what you are getting into before getting a pet. These shelters and humane societies exist because people just do not care about animals anymore. Animals were not intended to be disposable but somehow that is what they are these days. Animal shelters are an easy way out when you get tired of your dog (or cat), and breeders are the ones blamed for this. Animal shelters and rescue organizations are making a hefty profit by keeping this misconception going.

Between 9 and 11 MILLION animals die every year in shelters and only you - as a pet owner can stop it. I just hope I maybe changed one persons mind about taking their dog to a shelter
PROMISE A FUTURE - and DON'T FAIL THEM! PETS ARE FOR A LIFETIME!!!

Update:
It's apparently a girl, and she's seriously dehydration. Her neck seems to be bothering her, but we're not sure why yet. She's getting warmed up and an iv overnight to try to re-hydrate, and they're still running some bloodwork. I'm sticking around for an hour or so to see how things go. 

Update 2:
After about an hour, but isn't sure why, and will get some x-rays after she stabilizes a bit.  She's staying overnight on IV in the kitty-ICU, and I should get a call in the morning on her status.

Update 3 (next morning):
Got a call saying that she's up and moving in her cage

Update 4 (night 2):
Went and saw her in the kitty ICU.  she's moving around somewhat, and a collar to keep her from pulling out the feeding tube.  She looks a lot healthier now, they've cleaned her up a bit.  They're hoping in 24 hrs her sodium levels will be back to normal.  She is front-declawed, so she must have been someone's pet at some point - they haven't checked her for a chip yet, I think because they're more concerned about fixing her other problems.  Oh, and they think she's about 5 years old.

Update 5 (2nd day after finding her):
Got a call from the vet.  Her electrolytes are back to normal, and maybe will be able to consider taking her home.

Update 6: (3rd evening after finding her):
Talked to the vet some more. Her pupils are less dilated, but they didn't find one in her.  She's steadily getting better, and they're going to focus on getting her better so that I can take her home.  She's a bit anemic though - dropping red blood cell count, so they are going to give her a blood transfusion.  She's showing some interest in eating, and drinking more on her own.  I'm going to see her again in the morning.

Update 7: (next morning):
The transfusion appears to have worked, and over the first few days had ""episodes"" (the vet couldn't come up with a better word) which are similar to what a cat goes through before going into cardiac arrest, though it's been over a day since the last one, and she hasn't had any problems with her vital signs after these.  Still the vet says that she's ""doing good"", just recovering slowly.  I hate to think of it this way, but I hope she gets good enough so that I can take her home soon, not just for her sake,,True,t3_edmhf

IF YOU OWN A PUPPY: Congratulations! Now don’t fuck it up by parading it around while it’s still 10 weeks old! Your puppy should not go on neighborhood walks, is at 4 months. If your puppy is less than 4 months old, confine their world to your home, puppy classes, and private socialization with dogs and owners you know well. Strutting around with your puppy before it is protected makes you a giant fucking tool and I hope you have the money to treat it when it contracts parvo.

IF YOU OWN A DOG: Unless you are an experienced breeder with the necessary time and resources, all that says to me is that you have a tiny dick, and marble-sized balls.

IF YOU OWN A SMALL DOG: Don’t feed it fucking table scraps. I don’t give a shit how much your dog begs and gives you that wide-eyed, you better believe they’ll repeat it.

IF YOU ARE A HUMAN BEING: Don’t be a douche bag and ignore signs that your animal is sick until Friday at 5pm, all while secretly hating your guts and wishing you many nights of blow-out diarrhea. Way to take advantage of people trying to care for animals. 
Fight the urge to accuse your vet of being money-hungry. While it is true that veterinarian offices are BUSINESSES and need to make money in order to function

And for fuck’s sake

TL;DR: If you are a student

May 2006 - March 2011

I miss him so much.
My wife and i got him when we were engaged.

I took him in on Saturday because he seemed to have had some weight loss and wasn't pooping as much this past week. Still had his full appetite, etc. Come to find his anal glands were swollen and were preventing him from going to the bathroom. The vet said it probably was causing him pain. Even during this visit he kept getting treats and seemed fine. We go home.

The next morning (Sunday) i felt him walking over my feet and shot up really fast to check on him. He had thrown up all over the bed (at least 5 times and it was all dark brown). So i got up and called the vet, they took us back immediately and they wanted to keep him overnight and watch him. After talking with them they thought it was pancreatitis. So after spending half of the day there, they took him back for the IV and meds, etc. This was the last time i would see him. They called that evneing a few times just keeping me updated. He had stopped throwing up and even was walking around and wagging his tail again.

The next morning (Monday) i awaited the vets call and they asked if I could come in and see if he would perk up when seeing me. After squaring things away at work I left and took the train to the vet. Once there I waiting in the lobby and down the hall I saw some people start acting frantic and then the door shut. My heart sank and I had an awful feeling all over me. They took me back and told me. He was doing ok and then all of a sudden his tongue had turned blue and they did CPR. He didn't make it. It was a very aggressive acute pancreatitis. My puppy passed away right when i had gotten there and was waiting in the lobby. It's like he was just trying to wait until I could get there.

I know we didn't do anything wrong and there was nothing the vet did wrong. Life just happens... and it just takes time to heal. He is in a better place and not hurting anymore. I personally believe I will see him again one day.

Whatever you do

It's so long I have to break it into two parts! But I wrote this to help me say goodbye and I thought some other pet lovers on Reddit might enjoy reading it.*

**Part 1/2**

I found [Dodger](http://imgur.com/g42xy.jpg) in 1999, gasping in fear, but no one was trying to help.  I don’t know why, but I ran into traffic to try to grab him.  He was not interested in being caught and pretty soon the chase was on.  At least in his efforts to escape me he got out of the street and onto the sidewalk.

I chased him through the streets of Hollywood for at least 30 minutes.  Every time I thought I had him he slipped away.  At one point,” and I resumed running.  Finally, he ran down a blocked side street where a man with a walkie-talkie stopped me from following.  

“You can’t come in here

“I’m trying to catch that dog!” I said

“A dog?” said the security guard.  “Let me see if we can grab him.”  He got on his walkie and his counterpart at the other end of the street moved to head off the only exit.  We cornered the dog between us and he finally stopped running.  I hooked a finger underneath his collar and knelt to look him in the eye. *You got me*

“You should name that dog Lucky

“No

I tried to find Dodger’s owner.  I put up flyers in the neighborhood and put notices in the paper.  I called local shelters to see if anyone was looking for a dog matching his description.  He had a collar but no tags, but did estimate his overall age to be about two years.

Part of me wasn’t sorry that Dodger’s original owner never turned up.  From the moment I knelt down and looked him in the eye, and after I toweled him off he rolled onto his back and put his head in my lap while his tail thumped the floor.  It was the only time he ever did that, and I know he was expressing his gratitude.  He slept on the foot of my bed that night and every night afterwards for the next 11 years.

Dodger’s street origins were apparent in many of his behaviors.  He had massive separation anxiety and would cry piteously if I as much as shut the bathroom door between us.  Once we went to visit my husband’s aunt and uncle and had to keep Dodger in the garage for the night.  When we woke up the next morning we had to buy them a new door - he had destroyed it trying to get back inside to me.  On the other hand, though, immensely pleased with himself. He also snuck food given any opportunity to do so.  We used to keep apples on a low,open shelf in the kitchen, and one day we watched in amazement as he dug up and ate an apple he had stashed in a potted plant in the living room.

I loved Dodger with all my heart, he merely tolerated  the other people in my life - my brother, my boyfriend (and eventually my husband), my housemates.  My mom and I were not on great terms at the time, and he warmed my heart when he barked ferociously at her during their first meeting.  He hated being manhandled by anyone, especially the vet.  I had to muzzle him for every trip or else he would growl and snap the second the vet put her hands on him.  He was also racist at first, which was a real problem since one of my housemates was an African-American man.  Luckily my housemate was a patient animal lover.  He cured Dodger’s racism by putting his dinner plate on the floor every night for Dodger to eat the scraps.

He was a fierce guard dog.  Although he only weighed 25 pounds, he would follow the plumber or handyman around our apartment, legs stiff, head down, and growling low the whole time.  He hated the mailman so much that we had to put plexiglass over the front window - he actually broke a window pane once by pounding his front legs against it. When we finally moved out of that apartment we had to rebuild the window sill with putty from all the damage he had done to it over the years.

His quirks were many.  He would “stalk” his water bowl, yet he would gobble up moldy bread on the sidewalk when we took him for walks.  He also loved to eat paper, and would munch straight from the toilet paper roll if we left it in reach.  He would often lie down with his paws crossed, looking like a regal dog in repose.  He walked well on leash and never seemed to get tangled up with anything.  If he walked around a signpost or tree, he was able to backtrack out of it.  If the leash went between his front and rear legs, he would do a little handstand and swing his rear legs over it to get clear.

One time Dodger had a pinched nerve in his back that caused him tremendous pain.  It was at night, sway in place, and then stagger a few more.  When we took him to our regular vet the next day, she saw his behavior and checked the pain medication prescription.  They had given our little guy a dosage appropriate to a St. Bernard.  The vet had no idea how he was even conscious, much less walking.  He was just that stubborn - he refused to go down.

Over time, his paw draped over my leg.  *Don’t for one second believe that I’m your dog*, he seemed to say.  *You are my person*.",,False,,t5_2qh6o,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/ep9r1/i_recently_said_goodbye_to_my_friend_and/
