Some of you may remember when CD sites had ""web-mistresses"" and links where you could ""fe-mail"" them. And there was no shortage of photos of dicks in panties or hairy legs in pantyhose and lots and lots of asshole shots. 

And I like that this subreddit draws a line against NSFW content because I don't feel like seeing it. And that's really the only line I like having. 

Yes

We don't need to splinter. If you don't like a link, post more of it!

We're a small community anyway and we dilute ourselves further by splinting into smaller sub-sub-reddits. 

I do wish we had more text content

Lately my wife has been assisting me, etc. as well as experimented with makeup. However, this weekend was the first time we put it all together (plus first time shaving, everywhere). To say I was happy would be an understatement ;). We didn't go out yet, but have plans to for next weekend :D

Please let me know how I did!

That doesn't mean you necessarily need to flaunt anything in anyone's face
  
Who's a better person (and who would you rather be): Some dude in your school / office who has been publically outted as a crossdressing freak, meeting people's gazes and causing *them* to be uncomfortable if they aren't ok with your hobbies?  
  
**The truth of life is that no-one is normal.**  Everyone has some weird and horrible secret.  
  
So don't feel the need to flaunt the fact that you enjoy dressing up like a chick sometimes.  But if you are ever outed?  Own the situation.

I worked at a young women's clothing chain. I was the assistant manager at the time and as such had to open the store sometimes. I usually closed because the manager worked days and would only work nights on the required day (Friday night). but company rules said I had to open 2 days a week so I got stuck with Wednesdays and Sundays. Which was fine with me because I was a night owl and Wednesdays were are slowest days and I often wouldn't even see a customer until noon. only down side was we rarely made our quotas on this day and would get ""talked to"" by our district manager frequently.

Well one morning an older man came in about an hour after we opened (maybe 50-60s

He then started coming in every Wednesday morning and would buy an item or two. Over time he became more talkative. We would talk about things off topic a few times. it was a welcome reprieve since the mall was dead most Wednesdays and I worked alone on these days. After a month or so he started asking me for advice on clothes. Asking if his wife would like certain items. He asked if they would fit her claiming she was his exact height and about his body frame etc. Didn't think anything of it. Helped him pick out stuff for her aiming at clothes an older woman would wear (not our clothes aimed at teenage hookers lol)

I guess he became comfortable with me over time. One day while helping him try and pick out clothes he finally says ""Ok i have a confession. As much as sometimes these clothes are in fact for my wife. Most of it is for me"" I could see he was nervous about telling me and he waited for my reaction. So I go ""Oh ok...well

The next week he comes in and asks if he could try on stuff. I told him as long as there were no female customers who needed the fitting room it was ok but that if a female did come in he would need to come out and let her use it (I had asked my manager who asked the district ahead of time in case the question had popped up). He said he was perfectly ok with this as it was a female clothing store and we only had one fitting room area. Plus we were so dead this day of the week it was never a problem anyways.

So the next week I get there to open my store and he is waiting outside with a platic bag. He had brought in his wig
He ended up being my best customer that year. He came in almost every Wednesday. The days he brought his whole get up

When it came time for me to leave he was devastated. i was joining the military and he panicked because he didn't know if he would be able to buy his clothes. Luckily the girl I was training to take my place was as open minded as I was. I told him she would be more than ok with his shopping and he would love her. So the next week I scheduled her to train during my Wednesday shift. I told her about him and she was so excited to be able to help him (she was a very excitable and energetic girl in the adorable way). When he came in that day he was very timid and nervous when he saw her. I told him to come in and meet her. He reluctantly came in. When I went to introduce her to him she cuts me off and goes ""OMG is this him?! Hi I am A***** I am so excited to meet you!"" he kinda looks at me but responds to her. She immediately took him away and began asking him questions and helping him pick out stuff. As I was watching I could see him relaxing as she went along. I knew he would be in good hands.

He asked me for my email when I left and for quite some time I received email correspondence from him. he would tell me how nice she was and how he still went in each week and bought stuff. The normal life stories and such. He was such a nice older man and I was so happy I could help him feel comfortable in his own skin. We've lost touch over the years and I still sometimes wonder how he is. I wish everyone could be so welcoming and understanding so people like him won't have to be ashamed of themselves. So glad my momma raised me so well and open minded &lt;3
