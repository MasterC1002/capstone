1375993345.0,1jz9lj,serious question for the ladies of /EDM,extralyfe,81,12,63,"so

I've been listening to EDM and going to shows for three years now, to me.

we've all been there - you're pushed up in the crowd

so, yet I see girls who were dancing in front of me grinding up on dudes next to me.

so, yanno, I'm down to dance some at shows.

I don't know

**edit**: okay

first, and that's what I've always been told, uh, 'dancing while standing in the spoon position' was called. I'll leave it intact, but mention that it's incorrect.

second, right? there are literally people touching you at all times, and when you add in the occasional crowd-surfer, mosh-pit, drunk dude stumbling through people spilling his drink on you and entire sections of crowd almost falling down after losing their balance thanks to said drunk dude, it gets hectic. how the hell am I creepy for wondering if the girl in front of me wants to dance after shoving back into me several times? I don't *do* anything, I keep my distance and my hands up. that's how I rage it out. I just can't figure out a way to communicate in the deafening sweat pits that are EDM shows, my post.

third, I could seriously feel the bass making the liquor in my stomach shake while outside smoking a cigarette. get that? I can barely hear a bartender shouting into my ear, much less a girlie who isn't facing me.",,False,self,t5_2qm8v,,http://www.reddit.com/r/EDM/comments/1jz9lj/serious_question_for_the_ladies_of_edm/

I just need somewhere to rant about this. It's a bit hard to believe this attitude still exists. 

1. No, the style, the method of creation, the music itself, doesn't need fixing. It's continually improving and evolving, sure, but not in the direction he suggests it is.

2. In fact, etc., as created by a group whose work has mainly been dance music. There's nothing remotely dance-y on the album.

3. No

I don't know. I just wish people would grow up and learn that their musical tastes aren't true or false

""**Daft Punk to Make TV Appearance**

Another rumor of a Daft Punk TV appearance has emerged. You may remember back when the Daft Punk ads were airing on SNL that the air was bussing with rumors that they would be appearing on the show. Well

This rumor does seem a bit far-fetched but crazier things have happened!

So yesterday I attended Trapfest in Denver, and he seemed like a really nice guy. We talked for a little and when the show started we went our separate ways. After the show was over my friend and I saw him walking around outside the venue seeming lost and confused. Aparently he had dislocated his shoulder during the show and when he went outside to get some air, the venue would not let him back in. So we went over to talk to him and he was obviously in shock. We had to leave because our ride was leaving but I didn't get his last name, if anyone knows who he is (if they attended Trapfest) I would greatly appreciate some closure on if he is ok or not. He is about 6'2, short blonde hair, wore glasses, and had a little backpack on. He said he is a longboarder and this isn't the first time he has dislocated his shoulder. But please, I would love to know he is ok.

1334730301.0,sfn3o,FEED ME's take on music and art:  Motivation,A4K,12,1,1,"This is what artists should be about.  FEED ME:

&gt;'This is the greatest game in the world.'

&gt;I've almost stopped doing interviews because I'm achieving nothing. If you want to find something out about me, but dragging through another interview that no one thought about for more than two minutes seems like treading very boring water. Not that they've all been that way; but it's the trend.

&gt;A well known electronic music magazine recently wanted to do a few page spread about my production techniques. They sent me a list of preliminary questions; what plugins do I use for 'dirty' sounds, but at this point, fuck it. The Mau5hax thing was great; I got to interface with talented people and enjoy making music. I learnt as well as got involved. I didn't sit and have my mechanical techniques picked at while my actual motivation was ignored; we made decisions together.

&gt;I don't mind the occasional production Q, and not ever our motivation? The reason anything I made sounds the way it did is because I sat and worked out every single piece of it myself. Give every one of us the same tools, and see what we all end up with - it's our differences in expression and decision making that makes us.

&gt;I'm doing this because I honestly don't know what else I can do. Music and art for me is a necessary release, and I was completely consumed by the satisfaction I'd found in this new idea of making my own music. It consumed my life and I found I loved what it brought to it, and now I'm on an endless journey to see where it takes me, and where I can take it. Because of it, my entire late teenage and adult life I've been travelling the world, from Spor to Feed Me, constantly humbled by the people I've met, extremes I've lived through - I'm nothing but overwhelmingly grateful

&gt;Some of it has been physically and mentally tough, but I am honoured to have what I have. If you're going to complain about your reality when you're living another persons dream, then I think you need a massive reality check. No one's forcing you. Music is magic; and I think as artists we have a duty to keep it that way, not dissolve it down into presets, complaints, one-upmanship and catering to the market. It's not all pink candy-floss cloud rides, and I think it looks fake if you depict it that way

&gt;I used to lie and listen to my favourite records and daydream about how they were thought up, but Feed Me is my world, a projection of a piece of me, and a way of expressing whatever I feel like. I couldn't have built what I have without you guys supporting me, but I'll always be creating and writing it none the less. I love you all for letting me take it this far.

&gt;I don't normally post my opinions on here, and 2) say why. TLDR.
