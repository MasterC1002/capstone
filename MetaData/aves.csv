1361842249.0,198a48,12 Types of People Everybody Hates at an EDM Show,The_Turbinator,280,52,169,"Most people go to EDM shows to dance and have a good time with friends...however these sub-species of people go with different motives. 
 
**1) “The Grinch”** – Nobody really knows why the Grinch attends EDM shows, with an ugly frown on their face.  Any attempts to communicate with the Grinch will result in a blank stare, and more frowning. 
 
**2) “The PTOT”** - aka the ""Prostitute Toddler"" – You’re not sure how these girls got past security at an 18+ show,  and Vick's Vaporub, the PTOT is characterized by lack of age-appropriate clothing, dilated pupils, and the assumption that everybody at the show is a drug dealer.  Even after breast feeding stops at around age 11, PTOTs continue to live with an oral fixation for most of their lives, and even attract their mates from afar with a ritualistic blinking pacifier. The potential mate responds by offering a lolipop or other sucker-type candy that the two will share while having coitus in the middle of the dancefloor. An interesting statistic is that over 75% of the applicants to MTV's Teen Mom series actually classfied their race as ""PTOT"".
 
**3) “The Zombie”** - The Zombie feeds on substances named only by random assortments of letters and numbers, and doing a dance which can be best described as a bad recreation of the original Thriller music video. Occasionallly the Zombie will attempt to speak, not realizing the general crowd population cannot understand their incomprehensible zombie dialect comprised of a series of moans and grunts. 
 
**4) “The Crowd Salmon”** – Thought to have evolved from the common river salmon, they are crushed against the barricade until near suffocation, requiring rescue from the nearest bouncer to pull them over the barrier. After rescue, they are then returned to the rear of the crowd where they can begin their journey again.
 
**5) “The Bitch”** – The Bitch is extremely cool and beautiful. Do not be fooled into thinking they are normal humans, or candy, dance too close, or attempt any form of communication, she more than likely will immediately react with a disgusted look and migrate to another spot to exude her bitchy greatness elsewhere.  
 
**6) “The SuperDanceBro”** - The SuperDanceBro, the SuperDanceBro establishes his dominance to his fellow DanceBros by loudly exclaiming how hard they are “rolling face” while fist-pumping wildly in an attempt to attract their nearest female counterpart (see “The Bitch”).  Do not dance too close during this mating ritual, for they have been known to sponteously begin ""moshing"" anybody within a 10 foot radius with little provocation.
 
**7) “The Plower”** - The Plower, the population is largely made up of drunk females, usually appearing to be on the brink of falling on their face and vomitting on themselves. Counter to common logic, rather than weaving through open spaces to get out faster, they are naturally prone to running directly into other attendees during their escape. Other skills in their attack arsenal include pushing, shoulder shoving, and knocking $4 water bottles out of people’s hands.
 
**8) “The Cryer”** – Originally thought to feed off sadness and the frustration of others, they will react by bursting into tears and drawing as much attention to itself as possible until everybody they came with is as miserable as they are before stopping. Studies have suggested the best method for avoiding a Cryer's happiness draining power is to look them directly in the eye, put one of your hands on their shoulder, and say in a stern, confident voice, ""If you don't stop crying, I am going to tell the bouncer I saw you hiding a large bag of methanphetamines in your ass."" Then promptly walk away.
 
**9) “The Plier”** – Still baffling to researchers is the mysterious Plier. A cross-breed of the Plower and the Cryer, they leave a toxic trail of bad vibes and behind them.
 
**10) “The Mau5keteer”** – The Mau5keteer worships their beloved mouse leader by wearing obnoxiously large homemade mouse heads, they will generally lend their head to the nearest (see “PTOT”) and hoist them onto their shoulders to maximize the TBR.
 
**11) “The HumpStar""** – The HumpStar's only dance move is rubbing their body against another HumpStar in a circular motion.  They will generally seek out the most inconvenient place to do this
 
**12) “The Milk Carton Kid”** – The Milk Carton Kid is always looking for their lost friend Molly. They do not actually listen to the music at the show

You should always keep blankets

It's not worth it. It's not. I know you think it won't happen to you. Guess what? I am 100% certain that every person who dozed off was sure they could make it. I am 100% sure they all believe it was the worst decision they ever made....  If they are even alive to regret it. This isn't just a rave issue but it's more frequent due to our scene dynamics. 

**you cannot control the body's need for sleep. It is an essential function for survival. No amount of coffee, vyvanse, crystal meth, loud music, cold air or splashes of water makes it safe. Your reaction time will still be shit; potentially worse than a drunk driver. Also, even meth addicts can nod off after shooting up due to micro-sleep.

1. Try dancing to songs you DON'T know. Not just for the headliner
2. DJs are on facebook and twitter. Also soundcloud. Each of these places allow you to contact them. Post songs on their wall, I swear. I know I do.
3. When a DJ you dig posts a new mix, or even suggest tracks for another mix. Trust me, the good DJs listen to what you have to say. Some of the nerdier ones actually like talking about music. I know I do!

Just a few helpful tips to get you more proactive in the clubbing experience. This may help alleviate some of the boredom you feel waiting for the next bandwagon to jump on.

My list of why I like them:

- They know what's up

- If you're new, and the meaning of PLUR and why it's so important.

- They are almost ALWAYS very well... *ahem* connected to the **right** people.

- They're usually the nicest people there (in my personal experience)

- **I want to think that I can keep doing this for a long time.** Seeing them there makes me really happy because it lets me know that there's a place for me if I want to dance and feel some love with people who love the same music that I do.

I was in a really rough place personally before I got into the scene. When I went to my first massive

I try to pay it forward everywhere I go when I go to massives myself now, making sure people have all the proper party materials, etc.

Who's ready to spread the PLUR love? PLUR packages are for sending some rave goodies to fellow ravers elsewhere in the world! This is a way to share your beautiful kandi or artwork and some fun toys with a new member of your rave family! This isn't just for reddit

I ask that all of your PLUR packages are worth recieving. No one wants to get a half-ass gift when they put their heart into theirs. So please

Start with a Kandi cuff and some singles and build from there!
*This regulates the packages so everyone get's a cuff*

**Suggestions for your perfect PLUR package:**
Kandi! (cuffs, anything!)
LED toys (rings
Letters! If anything you send has a story with it
Artwork. If you would like to send specific boy/girl items let me know and I'll do my best to match you correctly (: These are SUGGESTIONS and by no means requirements. Fill your package with what you see fit

There is no item limit/requirement. The point isn't to fill this with pricey things

**REPRESENT YOUR CITY/STATE**
Maybe make a kandi bracelet with your town on it

**The goal is to share your culture** with someone new. Make the best PLUR package you can and someone will be very happy with it (: 

**SUBMISSIONS:**
Send your first name (or raver name) and your address for the package to be sent to to [secretsantaplurpackage@gmail.com]

I will email each of you a randomly selected submission on December 16th for you to send your PLUR package to. Please keep in mind you will be paying for shipping/handling. Anyone can participate no matter your country. If you're out of the US I'll try to match you with someone close to you! Or if you want you can request to trade with someone from another country! If I can't match you with someone within your country and it's not requested to go international I'll ask who I match you with first to make sure prices of shipping/handling is okay. 

**DEADLINE will be DECEMBER 15th!** 

If you have any questions and are directed to this as a non-redditor ask me through the email

Peace
-Plur Santa
Edit: Please include your full name (mailing purposes) Rave/nickname if you'd like, and any requests (: 

**PLEASE share! Let's see how many people we can get! Just in the first day I've gotten almost 40 submissions! Let's keep 'em coming!!**

**Edit** *Two new pieces of information!* **One!** If you would like to have the chance and possibly meet up with your secret Santa include your town and/or raves coming up that you know you're going to. I can try to match you up within the same town

**My goal is for this to get worldwide

**Edit:** If you want to give your match a chance to choose a cuff/piece out of a few options to really their taste and bring the most satisfaction you can include a picture for me to forward with the address. You don't have to rush to try to get a picture of your kandi for options though. The email puts all conversations together so you can add a picture closer to the deadline. That way you still have plenty of time to make your kandi pieces (:

*Note* I will include email, and other relative details as they are provided

**Edit: YES this is still happening! I'm waiting for all the submissions to come in so I can match those who have requests as best I can! Sorry for the wait! I'm thinking about moving the deadline back a couple days to Wednesday the 12th. What do you guys think? If I get enough responses saying I should move the deadline back I will start matches then

I ended up taking ~350mg of it in a capsule 1 hour before I got to the venue, I was like ""Yay I'm coming up, I sure do love rolling"" but then very quickly turned into ""OH SHIT OH GOD WHAT IS HAPPENING"" and basically all at once it got way too intense, way too fast. It's the only time I can ever recall being uncomfortably high on MDMA. I got delirious, I didn't know where my friends went, where I was in the venue or where I was trying to go, and stumbling over stairs and chairs like I was super drunk. It was really bizarre how quickly it happened

I must have looked as bad as I felt because I got to the bathroom and all the bros interrupted their conversations about ""omg dude, look at this guy!! are you okay man?!"" and I don't know if I really responded or not. One guy came over to me, grabbed the water bottle out of my back pocket, filled it in the sink, and was like ""Bro. BRO!! Drink some fucking water dude, right now. I'm serious"" and he made me chug a couple bottles of water and then sit down on a couch and chill out for a bit until I started coming back down to reality and regain my bearings. I must have been mostly dehydrated because I felt much better pretty soon after that, I told him I felt better and he left

**Table of Contents**
Introduction
- a bit about FB

- A) Outdated method
        
- B) How to Get Floods of invites on FB 

- C) Reading Invites for Clues / Evaluating Potential Raves.

**Introduction**
So there are frequent post asking where the parties are for each city. While I/We don't mind helping

First and foremost....no one

**Facebook**
I hate saying this...but it's true: Facebook is required. The only reason I joined FB is for events. It still makes me feel icky...but you will work 3 times as hard to find 1/3 of the possibilities without it.

You may want to make a fake name or alternate account because you're going to be ""liking"" stuff you may not necessarily truly dig.

**Section A The Outdated Method**
On the extremely unlikely chance your city still has a record store that sells DJ vinyl...Bam! Go check there and the community bulletin should have stuff posted. Related to that, 2nd hand book stores, vintage clothes boutique. Generally you're looking for independent business, particularly clothing or music related that serves a mostly college aged clientele. You may discover a stack of flyers or posted events on cork board. 

BUT

These days I def would NOT make a special trip to do this as it is unlikely to yield much...but if you're nearby or doing some shopping keep your eyes open. That's more how we did it back in the era of dinosaurs. 

**Section B
Now for FB

A good place to start is google. ""DJ DnB [your city]"" I don't care if you're a junglist or not...here's why:

DnB almost always tied to events with no dress code, they will most certainly post gigs they're at. If you have no interest in this genre, check places they are playing  with multi-rooms or diverse line-ups to get the other local DJ names as well. 
""Like"" any that are listed as EDM genres. Also

The reason you don't want to start searching. ""DJ House [your city]"" is house can be booked at very strict dress code clubs

Now this should start opening doors for you. If you find that you ""liked"" a promo crew and they look promising

Furthermore


Do not decline events early in this game
-----------

**Section C Reading Invites for Clues / Evaluating Potential Raves.**

So...now you're getting tons of invites...but how do you know the difference from the Jersey Shore Fan Club-Clubs and decent events?

- Again

- If you see a DJ(s) listed as Top 40 or House/Moombahton/Top 40 9/10 it will be more Frat House than Funky House.

Other red flags : 
- 18 for women/ 21 for men. - Dress to impress.
- Free/discounted with a college ID. 
- Hip-Hop in another room (hip-hop is played at some raves but usually because the DJ is a turntabilist...and will be listed as such or a ""DMC"" winner or finalist etc. ) 
- No mention of ""no weapons no drugs.""--Seems only added to rave flyers/event descriptions
- Any kind of description of ""upscale lounge"" VIP bottle service
- No links to soundcloud/or other music promo pages.

These red flags are by no means perfect. I've been to many great events that broke 1 or 2 of the aforementioned rules. But 3-4 together is usually a strong sign. 

When in doubt...check it out. You can always drive by a venue and scope the line and decor. Usually that will tell you all you need to know. If it looks cool

If you really, what kind of music is playing etc.


Hope this helps. Drink lots of water

One final tip...remember that at every moment you are responsible for your own happiness. You always have a choice to be 100% in charge of your reaction

Happy Raving! 


I'll edit the OP to give credit and add any good advice made in the comments...

I have NO problem with people wearing shirts/tanks/hats/shades with big neon printing that says, but if you do, that's fine, whatever, it's your style, have fun.

But can we please stop wearing shit that says ""Where's Molly?"" or ""HAVE YOU SEEN MOLLY"" or ""R U ROLLIN"".... ""Sex Drugs and Dubstep"" is barely tolerable to me. It's not a direct reference to any specific drug.

Yes, trivial part of EDM music? You don't HAVE to find Molly to enjoy EDM, and when people who are newcomers to the scene see shit like that, they see us as nothing more than pill heads looking for their nightly fix.

We are pushing something like this into public light

 In my opinion it can only hurt our community and It makes me sad to see people wearing that stuff. Because then others think it's okay, and soon enough that's all EDM will be known for. 

Just use your heads

This past weekend

I'm not here to bash alcohol or drug use

But please remember a few things

* The more alcohol you drink
* The more substances you have
* Don't be afraid to ask for help. I know that if I saw someone about to faint
* Please be fucking careful with the drugs you take if you choose to do them. Try to buy from a trusted source... Acquire a test kit and test your drugs
* Designate a driver
* Drink.WATER.


I don't mean to bring down the general happiness of this subreddit

Much love.

Last fall I went to my first big rave on a whim because a friend got me a cheap ticket, and was just caught in this euphoric state the whole time. The following months became me falling in love with all sorts and styles of electronic dance music, and I planned my next rave. Lucky, which was back in march, was stellar. I had an even better time, and met some sick artists. That euphoric state lasted a few days. I began to realize, that my love for music was overcoming my depression bit by bit. As I am in the midst of planning my 3rd big rave, began talking to me about how he was looking for a roomate to produce music with. I instantly threw my name in the hat for him to consider

-We are in the process of getting our first house.
-I am ecstatic to be leaving this horrid town.
-I plan to work on starting fresh in a new town.

1294097758.0,evoir,A more realistic story behind the EDC death,Lysergide25,49,10,13,"I posted this in one of the TAO threads

Over the weekend I was at a small house party with a lot of people who live in LA and were going to TAO. I met a few people there who knew Sasha and they told me the real story behind what had happened. 

As you may know, and a whole slew of accusing statements towards Insomniac. It's all bullshit, though. Insomniac literally played zero part in her death, other than the security guards not checking IDs closely. See, Sasha was one of those really scary raver-kids who go every weekend and roll hard. Her parents let her do pretty much whatever she wanted, and they knew damn well where she was going, too. She was one of those kids who popped 3-4 pills every weekend without thinking about it. Upon entering EDC, drank too much water, and then her friends took her off to the side and tried to revive her for about an hour before some officials saw what was happening and stepped in.

So, but ultimately they are damaging the shaky foundation that massives already stand on. Because of one underage girl acting like an idiot with parents who didn't watch their daughter carefully, and because Go-Ventures/Insomniac completely blew it with TAO this year, there's a good chance that AB-74 isn't going to get tossed out into the shitter like it should be.

Again, but this is what was told directly to me. 

Please, renegades, parties, raves, whatever the hell you want to call them - are on the way out because people aren't being careful and responsible. Massives in LA are pretty much decriminalized massive drug gatherings with good music, despite what anyone wants to try and say, and the fact that they are even allowed to go on is amazing. There is a chance here to shift a paradigm about drug usage, ultimately causing officials to look at events like these as a bad thing.

Please be safe. Please be careful. PLEASE SEEK MEDICAL ATTENTION IF YOU FEEL SICK OR BAD. PLEASE know what you are taking. PLEASE trust your source. PLEASE respect the police and security working events - they aren't there to screw you over. Please respect the venue. Please. PLEASE. Please know how MDMA and other chemicals work before ingesting any of it (nobody needs more than .5 of MDMA in an evening,,False,self,t5_2rev7,False,,True

City Heat Magazine - December 1999 

""It's around midnight on a Saturday night. I'm walking with a friend down a dusty road somewhere in the middle of the desert. The full, heavy base that beats like a racing heart. Tribal and organic in nature, it's as timeless as the universe yet, it is completely synthesized. We stop our conversation briefly and look at each other with a smile. We're about to arrive at a rave.

Raves have been around for many years now. From the abandoned warehouses of London, any time. Some are as small as a private party with only a handful of people, some are as large as a big city. 1998s Love Parade in Berlin brought 3 million people together. My personal favorites are the Arizona desert raves. They get any number of ravers from fifty to five hundred or so and since the choice of music is focused on progressive techno and trance, the people who attend are generally older (by ravers standards) and more responsible and descrete partiers. But as any raver will tell you, it is impossible to categorize what a raver really is. I've met all sorts of people at raves, from underage homeless runaways to retired university professors.

Some say raves are the modern day version of the 60's and 70's hippie movement. That explanation leads one to believe that raves are nothing but a pagan ritual for the none conformist to get high, what is it that truly defines and separates raves from other human rituals? I think it has a lot to do with attitude.

Remember 2001 A Space Odyssey? When a tribe of Neanderthals woke up to the giant monolith planted in their midst? Raves remind me a lot of that scene. When I watch a group of sweaty dancers rest their heads on the metallic grill of a giant, 2 million years ago, touching, sniffing and kissing the unfamiliar and fascinating dark object. Raves are about our future. They inspire us to become aware of ourselves, our surroundings and our humanity. They are about how we will come together as a species and how we will treat each other. They are about how we will communicate and express our thoughts and emotions to oneanother.

The music that is played at raves generally sounds meaningless and repetitive to many people. It might become extremely disturbing and intolerable and could even evoke anger and disgust. But to ravers, eyes water with joy and jaws shiver with ecstasy. Once again, we prove to the world and to the skeptics that we are indeed **ALIVE**! We celebrate life with a vengence. Like I said, it's all about attitude.

We only need to remember that raves are NOT a way of life. They are a ritual. An exercise for the soul as well as the body. We need to realize that the monolith we climbed the night before was only there to inspire us. We cannot take it to work with us for moral support and we cannot hide behind it to avoid life's strict requirements. We also need to accept that not everyone can, we have to be the first to admit that we're no better than anyone else. If we are to promote peace, love, unity and respect we need to accept all others before we expect them to accept us. Did I mention it's all about attitude?""

Coachella last year, when some girl walks up to us, clearly rolling balls as well but looking really stressed. She asks us if we've seen her phone, saying she was just over by these pine cones and thinks she lost it over here. Now, in my current state of mind, I wouldn't have seen her phone if it was duct taped to my forehead, but I lazily reach back behind me and lo and behold it's there. The look of pure happiness and gratitude on this girl's face was amazing, but is special nontheless.

Another one would be a different time that same night, leaving me incredibly flustered and my girlfriend almost dying of laughter. I look over to my left and see another (different) guy with a facial expression that unmistakably says ""what the fuck just happened?"", so naturally I ask if he just got ambushed by the sneak kisser, which he did, and we laughed it off and shared a spliff. A surprise kiss on the cheek lead to a new festival friend.

The general stigma associated with raves and festivals is an effort at shoehorning people into clubs and concerts that exist solely to make money off you. Organizers don't want you smoking weed or rolling on E

Whenever someone who recognizes this has the brilliant idea to put together a concert

This fear is reflected in the recent bannings of certain iconic rave and concert elements, and sitting down (around the perimeter of a venue or in groups getting lightshows). There are 'get up and dance' crews, who are just security guards who wont let you sit down. This has two effects in their eyes past their veiled claim of safety. First, they believe sitting is synonymous with taking or selling drugs. Second, if you are tired and forced to stand, you are more likely to shell out money for a drink or something. It is decisions like these by organizers that are destroying the scene, which I believe will move back underground to preserve the reasons why we go to these shows at all.

The last show i went to was a halloween rave. In actuality, they were taking glow sticks and light toys from everyone, saying that they were 'dangerous'. I met a guy there plastered off his ass with half a fuckin pool cue that could actually kill someone, unlike a 5"" glowstick on a shoelace that couldnt even put an eye out. If theres two things that dont go together in large groups, my vote would be for weapons and alcohol.

This isn't a guide for professional promoters or pretty much anyone that has ever thrown a party with more than 50 people.  I want to foster grass roots growth.  It only takes one person's initiative to spur on a movement of several crews.

Here are the most important things you will need if you want to throw a rave:
-Location/venue
-Sound and lighting
-DJ's/musicians
-Security/staff
-**Party-goer network**
-Little stuff (glowsticks, tables, decorations, themed items, act.)

Rule number 1:  Everything that could ever possibly ever go wrong will go wrong.  And then more things will go wrong.  Have as many contingency plans in place as possible
Rule number 2:  When you go from being a raver to a promoter

The venue will always be your worst problem.  Real concert venues around town are usually not exactly what you want.  Those can be very expensive and charge a load up front.  NETWORK!  Drive around town and call every sketchy-ass looking for lease sign until you find someone willing to let you use their building for a night for a couple hundred dollars.  ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS MAKE THEM SIGN A CONTRACT.  You can Google search contract templates and print them out in a few minutes.  If you don't do that, it will be weak if you don't have the juice.

Outdoor venues can be majorly rewarding.  Field raves are fucking awesome

Sound and lighting is another major hurtle.  Start networking again

DJ's are pretty easy to get, too.  If you don't have to pay them, you don't have to pay them (gas money is nice).  

At the end of the day this is all going to come down to relying on a network of people to do what they agreed to.  Most of this is going to rely on trust and friendship bonds.  You need go keep your friends close, and some other things.  Many people just want to help.  Security is important!  You need to be conscious of who you're letting in without charging.  Sneak 50 people in, and suddenly you're short $750.  Even if you don't have legit security, make absolutely sure that you have at least two or three big guys that you can trust and rely on that can beat the shit out of anyone.  Invite photographers and dancers if possible.

Your network of friends will be the most important variable in this entire process.  It's an attractive idea to market using Facebook, but I've found that that's not very effective at a low level.  What you need is personal networking.  You need to call every single person on your contacts list and tell them about this show and get them hype about it.  Then you need to ask them to tell their friends and show up with a car full of five people.  You then need to text them once a week so they don't forget.  Facebook is a great tool over messaging (Side note:  Everything you ever type on Facebook in private messages can EASILY be made public to the people or to the cops.  Watch yourself.)  A really shitty rule of thumb I like to use is take the number of people RSVP'd as going (ignore maybies) on Facebook and divide by three.  It all comes down to personal networking.  Almost everyone that says they'll show up won't.  You'll have way less people than you hoped for - But the show will still be awesome.

Legal issues:  All raves are somewhere between totally illegal and slightly illegal.  Research the sound pollution laws in your area - Those are how most raves get shut down.  Venue licensing is important.  The bottom line is that if you attract the cops' attention, even if you are ""legit""

You can throw a decent party for $1

This is by no means conclusive or thorough in any way.  I just want to give you guys something to think about and a way to get started.

What I posted has more holes in it than a slice of swiss cheese at the atomic level, phone calls, favors, money, mistakes, and ~~bong hits~~ creativity to get a party to work.  It may be the best and worst night of your life in one.",,self,,

My friends and I all bought tickets for Starscape months ago, drove over an hour, arrived at 10:30 pm and were turned away at the door. Apparently the fire marshall decided that the venue was overcrowded and so they closed the gates completely for the rest of the night. None of us got to go even though we all had tickets. I've never been so disappointed. Having lived in/near Baltimore County all my life, I've been wanting to attend Starscape for years now, and the year I finally have all of my ducks in line so I could go and party with some awesome people, the event is so completely mismanaged that we were turned away even though we had tickets.

So there. Glad to get that off my chest. I'm never trying to go to Starscape again, r/aves. &gt;:[",,False,self,t5_2rev7,False,,

Not for the actual question at hand. I have no problem at all letting lose and just flailing my arms around and dancing like an idiot alone, I pretty much just stood still or sort of leaned back and forth...


So how what do I do in this sort of situation? perform like a humping motion? (lol seems silly thinking about this.) Just sort of sit still? (seems boring). Again I know this is a ridiculous question

That isn't to say that people who don't attend EDM shows live boring lives. But I think something very important and unidentifiable goes on in the midst of everything at an EDM show. Drugs or not, being fed by the music and lights. 

I can think of no other experience in my life that has been as intense as these times. Nothing. Again

* It was a very underground thing where you'd get invites from people at music stores and they never really got bigger than 1000 people.

* It wasn't as much of a ""scene"" as it is in today's sense

* People were supposedly friendlier back in the day.

* They were held in warehouses instead of open lots.

* The music was kinda different.

This is mostly going off of a conversation I had with a guy who was really into the scene back in the early 90's in San Francisco. I can only imagine how crazy and different it might have been
