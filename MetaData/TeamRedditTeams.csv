**APPROXIMATE ELO**
I know it can be embarrassing but if you want people to actually respond they want to know an approximate skill range of yourself. Even if it is low

**SERVER**
NA / EU-W / EU-East (Self explanatory)

**TIME ZONE**
Helps with arranging specific times to play / convenience

**ROLE**
What do you normally play? This is extremely important and you should include 2-3 champions you are *good* within a role. Do not list off 5-7 champions in one role because you probably cannot play that many champions at an acceptable level (this is *not* noob stomping but understanding match-ups

**COMMUNICATION**
Skype

This will drastically improve posts and important information that can be quickly obtained. If you just post ""AD carry LF team/duo"" and you give some text ""cant get out of elo hell"" most people will just think you are not very bright. Think out your post and give **detailed** descriptions about your playstyle and champion range.

1329235904.0,pp86a,Alright so here's what I'm looking for: ,al0newestand,22,2,13,"A ranked team of utter gentlemen.

I was thinkin' we'd go with *League of Legents*.  Get it?  

Preferably but not at all required

**What this entails:**

1. **First and foremost

2. **Proper grammar would really be fuckin'**... It would be the tits

3.  **No ELO required**!  Hey man

4.  **So you're just saying you suck and are trying to pass it off as acceptance
Haha *whaaaat?*  No way... I--Psh.  No, and it's jungler-geared.  I prefer not to jungle, but I've come to learn that runes are *essential* to junglers whereas anyone else can survive pretty much without them.  What does this *really* mean?  I've got a damned nice understanding of large amount of champions.  I've got a huge amount of diversity.  I have my favorite champions, yes, but I'm also capable of playing almost 50 champions with decent knowledge of how they really function.  This also means I understand and can predict enemy tactics more efficiently. 

4.  **Scorpion Wins - Friendship!**  Obviously getting together the sort of group that won't end up biting one another's head off is going to need a common ground.  As you can probably tell by now, and serious about my game.  Yes, I want to win; we all do.  I just like to remember that I'm playing this game because I *enjoy playing it*.  I'm not HotShot, and I'm not playing for cash .  I will do everything I can at all times to try and make sure our team wins.  I almost never surrender unless my team *really really wants us to*.  I'm stubborn and vindictive and fight to the bitter end.

5.  **You typed way too much** - I know.  Nobody even reads this subreddit, etc and I'm ready and willing to voice chat while gaming.  If you're interested, PM me, comment, or do the LoL-y thing: my summoner name is Ninjujitsu.  Let's class up LoL and have fun doing it.

**Edit**:  How foolish of me.  I'm NA.  I'd be happy to play with anyone on my smurf account

**Edit 2**: Interesting factoid: League of Legends has *millions* of users.  Hard to believe?  Well if you think about it, there are people like you and me out there.  Decent human beings who enjoy the game and don't regress into the [Greater Internet Fuckwad Theory.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_disinhibition_effect)  Even if I'm not the teammate you're looking for, don't be discouraged by the assholes in solo queue no more than you are the assholes you bump into in public.

**Edit 3**: I just want to thank the three of you that up-voted this thread.  Scroll down the front page and you'll see mostly straight 1's.  There's a sponsored proposition (ie money involved!!!) that has 7

**Edit 4**: Wow, but hey that works too!  I don't mind playing with ents.  They're a friendly and well-meaning people in my experience.  Double also, I'll be happy to play normal games with people on EU or those under level 30.  I've only played a few ranked games, so it's not like that's all I'm interested in.  Thanks again!",,False,,True,t3_pp86a

Some of you might recognize me from my stream on twitch and/or the fact I was one of those banned Elo boosters a few months back which led to my AMA... or from dota/hon.. Or wherever. ANYWAYS.... Please listen up! 

My team qualified for the Riot S3 Path to Pro and due to some unfortunate circumstances we need to fill our support slot. Seeing as I am our ADC its my job to pick one. I realize this is short notice and nothing close to optimal but it's the best we can do. 

REQUIREMENTS: 

17+ yrs old from NA

Available to duo q as tryout Thurs 

Available to play in qualifier this Friday from 10am PST on; as well as on Sat 

Available to fly down to LOS ANGELES CALIFORNIA USA the 11th (riot will pay for everything) 

Willing to become a riot sponsored player with a salary which means you must practice with us 4+ days per week and take this shit seriously

2k + ELO support main season 2 or 1850+ s3

Willing to speak up with a mic as well as listen 


Also realize that the odds of us actually gaining a slot as a riot team is low

Please respond/message me with your lolking summoner profile link Page thing as well as any pertinent information (I. E. History

Also realize that just because you don't hear back from me doesn't reflect anything besides the lack of time that we have to fill this slot with. No hard feelings. 

I'm sure there's more that I'm missing so check back for edits. 

Also you can contact me directly at my stream @ www.twitch.tv/dye44

Annnd if this doesn't apply to you my team would appreciate an up vote just so this thread gets more exposure. Realize you are helping out a team of 4 dudes who love league and who knows maybe we are the next TPA

Greetings summoners! My name is Q and I will be the director of eSports, I would like to establish that this is my attempt at creating a successful eSports organization. What that means is, we will be seeking sponsors and community recognition through marketing, as well as gameplay. I am looking for dedicated (preferably well rounded, high skilled, knowledgeable) players who are willing not only to give their all to the team and the organization but to also be willing to market themselves, and their organization proudly. It will be taken seriously

This being said, meaning as far as monetarily, in the beginning, players will not be paid a ‘salary’ style of pay. The success, and monetary value of the organization will rely on the dedication of the players as well as any additional support we seek through management and scheduling roles. The players will receive what they put into the organization. To succeed, you must win, it is that simple. It takes a large kind of dedication that not all players are up for. Players on the team who stream, while money/prizes from tournaments will be split between the players as well as the organization. As the organization creates more buzz within the community (primarily through performance) the amount of money made will increase. As we become more successful within the League of Legends community




**What we are looking for:**
	For each role, game knowledge, awareness,an understanding of your job in a teamfight, as well as solid communication (large part). In the champion select screen, you must understand your role within a team composition, as well as be planning out what you are going to do to help win the game, I would like to point out that there are going to be losses; being a part of this organization means you hold a willingness to help others improve



**Why two teams?**
	One thing I notice about the NA scene is, via scheduling. Each team will operate independently, aside from practice scheduling, meaning they will enter tournaments and competitions as separate entities entirely. A good example of this would be Frost and Blaze, from the Korean servers.



**What roles are needed:**
	We are going to need several roles to populate each team. When you try out, what team you are on will be decided by comparison to the other players who also made the cut. (this only applies to the roles that are needed on both teams).

Reflectia (Team A): Top

Reflectia B: (Team B): Top, AD




**How do I try out?**
	If you feel like you would make a great addition to the organization


*The applications shall be formatted as follows:*

Being a sub, so your schedule will be very light and flexible. However, be prepared for maybe 1 tournament a week (which can take up to half a day, depending on how far we get) and 3-4 hours per 1-3 days a week for scrims. 
You will definitely be expected to at least practice with the team a couple of nights a week

Also, etc.

Requirements
We do have certain requirements to qualify for our team

1) Working mic/Skype. We use Skype during practice and tournaments to communicate with each other. Having Skype and a working mic to talk to our team is an absolute must

2) We prefer for you to be at least 1500 elo. However, so if you aren't certain of your support skills, this may not be the team for you.

3) Be a good support player! This is an obvious one. But please be comfortable playing a variety of support champions (playing all of them is a big plus). Know what to build for any situation. Be an avid warder, this may not be the team for you.

4) Be a good team member! This is another obvious one. We would like a team member who is laid back and an overall amiable person who is easy to get along with. Be a vocal person who is comfortable with communicating with the team about what's going on in the game. Don't be a rager or a smack talker. Playful banter with the enemy team is okay, talk with the team about it, and move on; we all try not to rage on this team c:

Random Info

1) We sign up for lots of tournaments

2) We play against 1900+ elo players on a regular basis (and usually do well!), etc. 

3) Once again, but don't want want to commit that much time.. This may be for you!

4) We have 3 1500+ players (one of them almost 1900) and 2 1400+ players on our team. Just to give you an idea of our team's average elo. c: But like I said

Since I chose to leave my team this summer, I've decided to start a team myself. I was 1600 S2 and am currently 1540. I have, however, Platinum, because I used play 3v3 a lot (Was #8 on EUNE ladders at some point). I shifted my focus to 5v5, but occasionally I help friends get a decent rating. I haven't played much ranked due to computer problems (solved now).

I am a 19 y/o Danish man

I already have a friend of mine who plays AD or Support and I main Jungle. So we need a Top
 
 
 
**What I want from you:**

* You have to have been at least 1500 S2

* You should be able to play several games (3-4) for 4-5 days a week. I don't want to recruit anyone just to find out that they can only play 3 games a week.

* Understandable English and mic. I can live with heavy accents

* Communication. Being a team is all about it

* No rage. This is pretty obvious

* Preferably 18 or older. I won't accept anything below 16.

* Share the same goals as me. You have to be willing to put time into this and participate in tourneys. That being said

* You should preferably have a decent champion pool. I personally have every single champion and for the sake of swapping

* You have to have a decent pool of champions for your role. I play a wide variety of conventional and less conventional junglers.

* Team experience is a plus. I have played in a number of teams with members ranging from unranked to 2k and participated in both on- and offline tourneys (Played mid vs Froggen once).

* You should have a sense of humour and be able to relax and just talk. Being comfortable with each other is paramount for a team IMO.

Ideally you will have had experience in the Jungler role in a competitive setting (Ranked 5's, etc.) You should also own all the champions viable to the role. (IE. Support - Sona, Soraka, Alistar, Janna at a minimum)

Time and Scheduling:

We currently play 3-4 days a week. Sundays(go4lols) as well as Tues

Conversely

Attitude:

LoL is a team game and your attitude should reflect as such.  You must be able to learn from mistakes and take steps to not repeat them.  We always try and have a good time so being able to take a joke is pretty necessary. That being said


If anyone is interested please reply here with the following (copy and paste):

We are two guys from Denmark

A) A team to join
B) To start up a team

Either will do. My current Elo (DatLolleren) is at 1336 (NN: WEST DatLolleren) - Though my Elo on the West server is 1028 (A bad Ranked start and the lack of motivation) with a Win/Loss on West of 12/14 and a win/loss on NE of 4/0. I've been maining AD Carry for quite some time, and I felt like I needed to help her get to know the game (Hence why I have a smurf on NE). My champion pool on NE isn't that big (I have Ezreal, Corki, Graves, Ashe and Twitch), but I am looking to expand it over the time I obtain more IP for use.

My friend is sitting at ~1128 Elo at the NE server due to a bad Ranked started along with him being unlucky with his premade friend and missing motivation of playing alone. His top Elo on his smurf on West is, other than AD (Mine) and, as I presume, top lane. He has mained mid for a time and Jungles when he can, but switched to bot lane with me when we are Duo'ing.

Other information would be, then go ahead and add me. In-game name on EUNE is WEST DatLolleren

I am level 15 but not really enjoying blindly pugging for groups. I find that a lot of groups I end up in get sabotaged by really bad play and general asshats in games

I'm not looking for good/pro players necessarily. Just a group of people I can have fun with from time to time. Voice chat is also a big plus due to the nature of the game and the inefficiency of using text chat in-game

For added information, Ryze, Poppy, Cho'gath etc quite well. I am not that accustomed to other champions otherwise. I mainly like playing AD carries, AP carries, gankers, tanks etc. I am willing to try other champions if anybody in this group has suggestions.

As for if I want to be competitive at this game? If I have free time

I used to be a StarCraft II player that wanted to go competitive but the over-competitive die-hard nature of the game was ruining my attitude a tonne and I just got sick of the game. I could go deeply into the reasons why the game frustrated me but the skill gap between Platinum and Diamond alone, I don't plan to buy HotS. Before I went straight off of Sc2, I slithered all the way from Bronze League back in November 2010 to Platinum by about April 2012.

**TL;DR:**

* Former SC2 player ranked Platinum League on EU server.
* Looking for a group of friendly people just to play LoL with because I want to experience this game the way it was intended
* Not asking for the best players
* Voice chat a major plus
* No pressure to go ranked/competitive. May try if I have the time.

I queue up for normal games to practise new champs and/or to have fun. Both of these things are usually hard to achieve, if you do bad. You can't really have fun with ""out-of-the-meta"" -champs either, because again, someone's always going to rage about it.

For that, if someone's doing bad. They should also have a healthy sense of humor and an ability to have fun (VERY IMPORTANT).

**For DuoQ**

I'm currently sitting around 1650 elo, in case I can't get support (I already play a somewhat decent ad, and I'm prolly the worst jungler EU O.o). I prefer to duo with someone, who plays ad, but that's not mandatory. You should be 1600+ and competent enough to climb the ladder all the way to the 1900 mark.

I want to build a new Team and i am searching for 4 people who wants to join my Team. Like you could read in the Title i am not searching for for players with a a certain ELO

I want to build a Team that is not based on high skill

You should have the following mentality:


* Never blaming your Teammates because they are ""noobs""

* Trying to get better by analysing your own mistakes

* Never Rage. Rageing about yourself because you suck hard is kinda ok.

* Buy wards

* You are friendly

* If your Teammate is losing try to motivate them again.

* Never surrender. Fight until its over. 


I also want to want a serious competitive Team but in fact i don't have any Elo conditions this Team will start by just train in normal draft mode until we have some nice synergy. 

Beside that i want to have a Team who like to talk about Team compositions and Team strategies. 

I would play the ad carry of this Team because this is my main Role. So if you are a main ad carry and want to join we maybe could build a second Team if there are enough people who want to join

Age and nationality doesn't matter you just should speak and understand English quit easily. 

If you are interested in this just wright your ingame Name

Hopefully out there are 4 people who would like to join me and my new Team.

In terms of rank

For instance: I believe one of my best traits in LoL would be my ability to read the map and i can tell what people are doing

The main thing that bugs me about solo queue is that teams just plain refuse to communicate/listen if they think they are better than you. Lets be honest

Anyways, and want to play more competitively.

-Solid Play (~1500elo)

-Non-ragers

-Willing to communicate and have fun

-Have headset

I am here today to recruit a couple of positions on our team and hope to find some good fits! If you are interested please read on into this wall of text and find the proper categories for you. Thanks!

Team Vort3x has two teams, however we have had to make a few adjustments and are in need of a Sub Support, Sub ADC and a few external roles such as Team Analyst/Coach to help go over replays, to assist in improving the team as a whole and generally be a pair of eyes on the outside of the team to give that extra edge.

**All Role Rules**



* No raging, but keep flaming and raging to a minimum.
* Must have a strong game sense, etc.
* This is not soloqueue, my apologies.
* You are required to have a microphone
* You must be 18+
* You must correct your atttiude prior to applying. Cockyness, we work together like one. Do not come in here and start an argument because you think you are right. We will discuss problems in games, comps and such in a respectable way and progress like a team.
* All applicants must be Gold V+
* You must be active on our website as we have a team only section
* You must have time! We are a serious,and be on line with the team on mumble all the time.
* Personality

**Sub MID**

* Must have a solid independent playstyle and able to withstand a bit of countering.
* Must be able to attend regular practice
* Must know how to trade and avoid taking much damage
* Must be able to roam
* Must have a deep understanding of a solo lane and have strong mechanics.
* Must be able to handle criticism well and also give input as well.


**Sub Support Position**

Many people think it's easy to support that you can do what ever and just let the Marksman do the job. Unfortunately that is not the case - not for us here at Vort3x anyway. We are looking for a strong support player who understands that the Support practically carries the lane at the beginning of the game. Basically the Support is the important part of the Bot Lane meta as of right now. And with this we are looking for talented supports who can do more than ward


* Communication is key! Talk to your ADC during games
* Strong game mechanics and teamfight mechanics. You must know your job
* You must have a strong champ pool
* Must be able to take criticism

**Team Analyst/Coach**


* Must have a super strong understanding of the game, champions, strategies, professional teams and playstyles.
* Must be willing to dedicate time and join the ranks
* Must have LOLReplay installed so that we may cover replays
* Must have a working microphone and willing to speak their mind without being a ****** about it.
* Must be Gold 1+ as we need someone with experience to fill this role.

Hi

I'm a student with a passion for eSports and League of Legends. I'm dedicated, I'm not looking for a team to play or sub for. What I am looking for is a team that is on their way to do great things, but needs a little more organization to get them there.

**What can I do for you?**

Most teams form

As your team's manager

- Find &amp; sign you up for regular tournaments.
- Match you with teams that are on or above your level for valuable scrims.
- Schedule EVERYTHING and keep you guys on track.
- Need a sub/replacement? I'm on it.
- Help you recognize and work on whatever issues your team might have.
- Want to get the word out about you guys/your streams on social media? Got it.
- Get you sponsorships (provided the team does well enough).

**You are...**

A serious team with big talent and even bigger goals. I love competitive League of Legends and I want to be a more active participant in it. My hopes are to work with a higher tiered team

Looking for a mechanically sound ADC who can at least play the popular ADCs + Vayne/Kog.

We are all over 21 and have been playing league for a considerable amount of time.  We won’t waste time and we will try our damndest to give everyone a try out.  We are not worried about the solo queue ELO that much just as long as you know how to do your job on the team and communicate effectively.  


We use Skype

You can contact Xilijan who may be on throughout the day or sprd who will be on after 5pm est.  You can also add your in game name to this thread with just a hello and I will contact you!  

Have a SUPER AWESOME DAY!!! 

EDIT****************

We have found our Bot LANE!!!

Thanks to all of those who tried out and sorry to those i couldn't get to.  I hope you guys all have the best luck!

If you would like to apply for our team I will have a link to the forums at the end of this post. We will review the applications and approve you for tryouts.

**History of myself**  


I myself have been on a few ranked teams with the mindset that playing in ranked team will improve my play in other parts of the game. It has and I’m glad I’ve had those opportunities. My past teams fell off though because of lack of drive. I want this team instead to have great drive to strive for the highest that we as a team can muster. Accomplishments by myself and past teams are that I placed in quarter finals in a few tournaments (not go4lol we only won a few matches there against plat people

I am not here to set a standard and with that being said anyone can apply. The one thing I can’t stress enough though is that you NEED to have the willingness and desire to reach the goals put in place. If you can’t take constructive criticism, then this isn’t a team for you.

With a couple blunders over the last few months of trying to join failing teams I've decided to try to put one together myself hoping to find a full group of like minded players. A little about myself before I talk about how I would like the group to run in a perfect setting. I've been playing League for nearly a year now, don't rage

Hopefully a few people on this subreddit can relate to my general experiences with league and want to get something started with me. Here are some general expectations/goals I have in mind for players and the team.

* Be self motivated! I want players who genuinely love this game. I want everyone to be passionate about what they do.

* Be passionate about your role! I don't want a support player who is playing support because he can't find a team who will have him playing mid. This goes the same vice versa

* Practice Practice Practice. Looking for players who are already giving up a good chunk of time grinding on their own. I would like to have a SOLID practice schedule once a few members join

* Looking for long term goals. I don't want this team to play a few games over the course of 2 weeks and then call it quits because we lost 3 games in a row. I want to build a long term relationship with a group. You're not signing a contract or anything by joining.... but hopefully you're not looking to hit it and quit it.

* No rage

* Headsets are pretty much a requirement for preforming on a higher level.... Skype/TS/Mumble/Vent I don't care really.

That's all I can think of for now

Pretty much same thing as what i can offer and at least 16 years old members and all gold rated or above in S2 soloq for obvious reasons(I know my elo sucks but as you know it is hard to carry a team as support).
I prefer TS3
And



Last words ... i do not expect to find the team overnight. I am patient. Unless i can fit in 100% i do not think i will be able to enjoy it.

I have started a team after posting [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/TeamRedditTeams/comments/yo09w/euwkagemi_can3lf_teammatesranked_5v5_tournaments/)
The team currently has a player for each position

I want the team to be able to play tournaments at least once a week (Go4LoL and perhaps others), and fit into the type of player I described in my [first thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/TeamRedditTeams/comments/yo09w/euwkagemi_can3lf_teammatesranked_5v5_tournaments/), join us :)

Also

&gt; From my experience it's very, who has issues with his internet, who has found a new girlfriend/boyfriend, who has to study for exams, who got hooked into another game, or who will have a fight with another member of the team and they don't want to play together again, etc etc. 
&gt;
&gt; So I don't want the team to be limited to 5 players. I want to have 5 ""main players"", and be comfortable with each other. That's why I will be bring new people even if we are already 5 and having good games, and I will try to make it that everybody has played enough times with all the others.
&gt;
&gt; Also, go ahead. I won't consider it like you're ""cheating"" on the team or anything. Because the truth is, perhaps after some time it will not work between us, so it's not bad if you have a back up team. Or perhaps there is another team out there better for you, with a better name, a better captain, a better organization, more fun
&gt;
&gt; If somehow I can bring the team to the finals of Season 3
&gt;
&gt; But right now, and I don't know your ambitions, I don't know how much you want to dedicate, nor how much you CAN dedicate to this game. Maybe you don't even know yourself. 
&gt;
&gt; It will take a couple of months before we figure things out. In the meantime
&gt;
&gt; In the end we will see what is the combination of players that has the best synergy
&gt; But whether you'll be main or sub, and have lots of epic games with unforgettable moments. And that if someday, for some reason, you're not in the team anymore, you won't feel it was a waste of your time because you would have actually learned a lot :)

I've been climbing up from 500 playing solo only but I just played a game that made me so horribly upset I'm desperate for any help.

 I played a game where we were winning 58 to 18 and we lost. Our team had a teemo and soraka bot that were duo. Soraka told us that she was paying teemo to help climb elo. At 30 mins when it was clear we would win Teemo and soraka sat at dragon and spammed shrooms and sat in brush. This went on for 40 mins! It was an hour and ten min game! Me and my two other players tried so fucking hard to win 3v5s while teemo and soraka sat in dragon area. They talked in chat to tell them they had all sorts of shrooms so dont go over there. And they didnt. Even tho they were 40~ kills behind they took every baron and eventually beat me and the two others trying to defend our nexus.

I have a lot of games to play before I start plateauing and I'd like to find someone who is better than me to play with.

Some reasons you might want to consider playing with me:

• Fluent English speaker

• Not a moron

• Able to take a loss without raging

• Quick learner

• Great team player

• I have my own vent but am willing to use any other voice chat client

..

Some reasons you might not want to play with me:


• I'm not perfect and I don't try to pretend I am.. not every game will end up with you dominating the lane with your pentakills of awesomeness. I'm all about competitive play but it's a damn game with people who are better than (and worse than) the both of us. Not looking for an endless rager or sore loser.

Truthfully, so I choose to focus on that. I can and do (often) carry the bottom lane from the support role, and I know every little niche and quirk of support play. I'm not so cocky that I think I'm carrying entire games, but I can definitely make the plays during laning and during teamfights, regardless of which support I'm playing.

However, AD carry, and occasionally mid.

Team:

Team GSO has been together and playing competitively for about 6 months

Activity:

We are currently in the Alienware NA battleground Invite Division and Tied for 1st place in our NESL open division. We have also regularly play in smaller tournaments as they become available. Once roster issues are settled we WILL be participating in Go4LoL's on a weekly basis. Our Ranked team Elo sits around 1400. If our elo is a problem please do not post.


Goals:

Simple. We're looking to improve as much and as fast as we can to go as far as we can in the LoL competitive scene.


=====================================

Minimum Requirements:

- We're looking for one more player to fill out the roster. You will need TeamSpeak 3 (free

- MUST MAIN AD CARRY ROLE!!!!

- Ideally you will have had experience in one of or both of these roles in a competitive setting (Ranked 5's, etc.) You should also own all the champions viable to the role. (IE. Support - Sona, Soraka, Alistar, Janna at a minimum)

Time and Scheduling:

- We play weekdays approximately 7PM EST to 10PM EST. Go4LoL tournaments start at 3PM EST every Sunday. Anyone interested MUST be availble these times more often then not. That being said

- We normally do not have any ""scheduled"" play on Saturday nights. However

Attitude:

- This is probably the most important thing. We're looking for people who LISTEN. You must listen and quickly react to in-game calls and instructions without hesitation. We value all of our team members opinions, not in the moment.

- You must be able to learn from mistakes and take steps to not repeat them. This includes accepting constructive criticism and advice on builds

- We always try and have a good time so being able to take a joke is pretty necessary. That being said

The three of us that know each other IRL are 17 and the other guy is 18. We don't really mind how old you are as long as you don't rage and are easy to get along with.

Teamspeak and a working microphone is a necessity because we're pretty much always on there and we use it for comms in games.

You also have to know the basics of playing AD carry, how to harass properly (with auto attacks as well as spells) and you need to be able to get along with our support, as well as the rest of the team obviously, but having a good connection in bot lane is pretty essential but that comes with time so we aren't expecting anything sudden.

In terms of personal skill I'd say we're fairly average

We need a 5th so that we can play ranked 5s and get as much practice as possible for any upcoming tournaments.

1328907955.0,pjvl7,[NA] Support Looking for Compatible Player/s,EmoJarsh,4,1,7,"Hi

I'll blab a bit about myself and then lay out what I am looking for


-About Me-
I've played League off and on (mostly off) for about a year. I started with friends but they had no interest in improving so I got a bit tired of playing with them. I then discovered I loved to play Support but that has the drawback of making solo queue awful. So that is the basis of my looking for some people to play with.

Personally I try very hard to put zero emotion into this game. LoL community is 99% poison so getting involved with in game talks only gets that poison into your system. I just focus on the game and let talkers talk

I also play very passive. Aggression is what sets a great player apart from all others but it also backfires a lot

Personally I am a 23 year old IT Major in Arizona


-Looking For-
I am looking for an AD to duo with or a team to play with. I am not looking for another role to duo with because it doesn't benefit as much  from the increased communication.

If you're an AD

If a team you must have dedicated team play times and understand overall team strategy

In any case I want to play with students of the game. Although I have not played much lately (just AI games for the daily IP) I read and watch a TON of LoL. This means I have good understanding of the game in terms of builds

Ideal person/people to play with would be educated on LoL

Below I will post a little bit about myself, and my current ELO bracket. ***I am up for playing normals first if you want to try me out or to see if we will play well together as a duo que team***.




***What I play***


***AD Carry:*** This is one of my strongest roles. I’m an excellent farmer and almost always win my lane if I have a good support champion in lane with me. In matches I am usually the highest CS. I’ve been accused  of having tunnel vision when it comes to farming, Vayne, MF, Kog’Maw, Graves, Urgot in that order according to experience with them and my comfortable level of skill.


***Jungle:***  I started off LoL as a jungler and still like to Jungle WW to this day. I’ve had great success as jungle Rammus and Lee Sin. I play a good Noctourne. Right now jungle Rammus is my go to jungle pick. I hate jungling fiddle. Strongest champs; Rammus, GP, Noct.


***AP Carry:***  Karthus was one of the first champions I ever picked up and I’m still surprisingly good with him, Akali, Brand, Annie


***Support:*** I don’t like it that much because I hate having to rely on other people to carry me, Janna, GP


***Solo Top:*** Weak point. I haven’t got to practice this much because someone else always seems to be doing it. I am however a very good farmer so I don’t imagine I’d have to much of a problem. Picks: Irelia



***Play Times &amp; Elo***


***Elo 1400:*** I fell into a hardplace already. I think I’m 10-6 at this point from solo queing. 3/3 wins on Cait



***Play times are 8AM EST-9PM EST***. I work a midnight shift for the US Navy so I can play anytime I’m not working. Hit me up in game and lets see if we can get something started.



***Note*** 

I know this set-up isn’t very pretty but I kind of rushed it. I just want to get in there and play and climb this ELO!

**[Pros]** 
. I rarely go negative in KD.

. Even rarer do I feed.

. Knows how to CS

. Values Assists + Team Plays/Winning more than getting fed

. Will never yell at a partner/BM or Rage quit.

. Good with many champions

. Knows when to retreats/push and how to target well in a fight



**Cons** [I'm certainly not perfect :p]


. I may miss out on some possible kills due to trying play safe. Not stupid kill misses but opportunities to gauge tower-diving and such.

. Not exactly extremely good at any 1 champions (Except Nidalee

. I don't really know how to counter pick against the enemy team or what champions have good synergy.


**Wants**

.Just a partner who isn't ragey and plays with decent skills or is willing to learn.

**MANAGERS APPLICATION SECTION**

 I am looking for a manager experienced with working with high level competitive teams. Any manager that can create spread sheets for practice schedules for the team

 1. At some point in the future

 2. You will create a spreadsheet of practice times for everyone as well as personal goals and champ pools of each player. This sheet will serve as a roadmap for the team

 3. For your work you will receive 1/6th of the money of any prize pools we win in any tournaments. If the tournament's prize is riot points you will receive 1/6th of the team's winnings of riot points as well as any skins if there is a 6th skin awarded (otherwise no skin will be given out to the manager in this case)


 **IF YOU ARE MANAGER APPLYING THEN YOU DONT HAVE TO FILL OUT ANY FORMS SIMPLY STATE YOUR EXPERIENCE AS A MANAGER AND WHAT YOU PLAN TO ACCOMPLISH, ETC.**

 Please leave your IGN so I may contact you in game. Do not directly contact me


**TEAM MEMBER TRYOUT SECTION**

**What you can expect from me**

 Hello fellow summoners, I have competed on a numerous amount of teams winning tournaments such as Go4Lol and z33ks. My aspirations have usually been too big for my teammates so I have decided to make a team with Thornsofmisery. I have spent the last half a year focusing on game knowledge (understanding comps, picks and bans, etc...) to help with my shot calling in the game. The account I am currently playing on is Diamond 4 with me reaching as high as Diamond 3 (before I took a 2 month break awhile ago).

**What I expect from you**

 To play on this team and be in consideration you MUST be at least Diamond V, for at least 4ish hours depending on people's schedule, obviously teamspeak/skype/ventrilo/dolby axon and a working mic is a necessity. Summoners applying must have a specific set of champions, and be able to trade with others in a draft pick scenaro. I am a very ambitious person, and I plan on creating a team that slowly will improve together and compete at the top level of League of Legends. There will be no toleration for raging, constant blaming, and put downs. If you can not receive constructive criticism or moments of tension between players this is not the team for you. I am looking for positive attitude players with the will to spend time to focus on getting better

**General Road map for how team will operate once tryouts are over**

 Monday-Friday: 4 hour practices/scrimmages 2-3 days of the week

 Weekends: Go4lol's on sunday as well as a minor tournament on Saturday

 After every game: Review and replay of game to see where we went wrong and what we can do to improve as a team in both communication and skill


**Player Attributes and further expectations**

 The applicant must have these attributes if applying:

 -Time

 -Focus

 -Positive Attitude

 -Sense of humor

 -Student of the game and his/her role

 -Willingness to learn from mistakes 

 -Ward placement and timers (particularly support and jungle)

 -Timers on jungle and objectives

 -Understanding trades i.e towers for objectives and vise versa

 -TEAM FIGHTS

 -Importance of CS/Kills and gold value

 -Reaction time to calls and ganks

 -Probably the most important.... Map Awareness and ward usage


 There will be time set aside for strategies and team comp setups. Please be aware that I am giving up a lot of my personal time for this team
 Before you start this application you must understand one important thing

**Positions filled so far**

 That being said

 Will be updated as roster spots fill:

 Jungle: ThePotatoCannon (Diamond IV)

 Adc: TBA

 Support: TBA

 Top: TBA

 Mid: Thornsofmisery (Diamond V)

 Manager: TBA


**Tryout Date Start**

 Tryouts will begin August 27th or August 28th! If you have any questions please let me (ThePotatoCannon) or Thornsofmisery know through posts via this thread! Do not contact us in game unless we contact you first!

Here is the premise.

I am going to create 2 teams to play with each other and to ranked together I will act as coach and player for MID / TOP.

The way is I will make the 2 teams each with relatively equal players try to find 2 teams that can work together. Pref if you are Gold V+ 

What this means if you sign up.

So I will fill both teams and start playing going max teams and games will be in-house scrims to start Team A vs Team B while doing this I will be evaluating players and seeing if there are any that have synergy together.

This wont be done over night and some time will be needed as I have a hectic schedule i'm sure you guys do as well so we will do our best to get this going.

Role: Top / Mid can sub ADC / Support 

Age: 24

Timezone: EST

Play times: I work in the hotel industry so my schedule varies from morning shifts to night shifts so it is fluctuating. BUT i play this game A LOT when im not at work I'm home playing (LoL saving money since 2011) Competitive gaming experience: None.

Goals on joining a team: I want to not only improve as a player I want to find a group of players who have the same focus as me. To improve themselves to improve together and to advance. I would love to play in Tournies and see how high a cohesive team can move up. I want 4 other plays that are skilled that can help me locate weakness or mistakes I wasn't able to even notice.

What you expect from us: ZERO EGO ALL COMMUNICATION. Team game is bigger then any individual if I tell you that you made a stupid decision I expect you to think logically if the decision was correct or incorrect and to communicate with me why you think your decision was correct and my assessment was incorrect or if you agree agree.

I expect you guys to tell me when I do something stupid or wrong and listen to my rationalizing of the situation and in turn make an open discussion on what would have been the optimal play.

I wanna be part of a team that wont just yell in game about making a stupid mistake which is counter productive to the atmosphere and confidence of the player.

I have a varying champion pool for both lanes and I can pick up champs very easily depending on difficulty of the champion (1-5 games to get a good grasp on the subtle differences) some champions I will NOT play just keep that in mind.. A.K.A Yorick...etc

I'm looking for a group of like minded individuals who want to improve as a unit.

Best of luck.

* Kunna ge och ta konstruktiv kritik. Jag vill gärna ha en kort summering vad som gick galet när man förlorar. Vart det gick galet och hur man skulle kunnat förhindra detta. Samma sak när man vinner

* Ha en schysst hög med champions som gör counterpicks lättare i champion select. 70-80%~ av alla champions

* Inte ge upp

Ik ben de team leader van het team Eternal Overwatch.
Pas geleden is ons internationale team gedisband en ben ik een nieuw team begonnen uit nederlandse spelers. Iedereen is plat of hoger en wij zijn opzoek naar een extra zetje in de rug.

Daarom hierbij het volgende

**Team Manager**

*Wat doe je?*

* Financiele zaken(Zoals bedragen die we moeten hebben voor lan party's)

* Zoekt Nederlandse toernooien op waar we aan mee kunnen doen.

* Zal moralen ondersteuning en eventuele zaken regelen op lan party's.


*Wat moet je zijn?*

* Je zult je professioneel en volwassen moeten kunnen gedragen.

* Goed met mensen op kunnen gaan maar ook assertief zijn tegen bepaalde personen(Dit i.v.m. eventuele lan support contracten etc)

* Veel vrije tijd


**Broadcaster**

*Wat moet je doen?*

* Onze toernooi matches streamen met een co-caster.

* Eventuele feedback geven indien er om gevraagd wordt.

*Wat moet je hebben?*

* Goed engels spreken(Je zult engels moeten stream)

* Kennis over de game en alle spells die elke champion heeft.

* Tijdens chaotische momenten op de been blijven en niet te groten fouten maken.


**Analist:**

*Wat moet je doen?*

* Je moet minimaal 2 dagen per week beschikbaar zijn om onze games te spectaten en constructieve feedback geven.

*Wat moet je hebben?*

*Veel kennis over de game. De feedback die jij geeft moet wel logisch en kloppend zijn.


**Als iemand is geïnteresseerd**

Als er iemand geïnteresseerd is hoor ik graag van je op EternalOverwatch@outlook.com. Als je dit wilt en je stuurt een mail zorg wel dat hij er verzorgd eruit ziet. ik zoek alleen serieuze mensen.

I'm Urf the Mudkip and I'm the captain of Team Deficio Uncinatum and today we parted with our top and ADC players. The reasons were failing to show up at agreed times and unhappiness about that. Therefore

The requirements for joining are:

* 16 y/o+: I prefer 18+ and will accept no younger than 16
* Activity: The training schedule is Monday through Thursday Evenings from 8 pm CEST until whenever we get too tired. If you don't have time in the evenings

Experience with Ranked Teams and online tourneys is preferred

We are Alienation Gaming, as well as playing Ranked5s with an end goal of reaching Challenger.

Right now we're on the lookout for:

* Midlaner
* Jungler
* Support (Maybe top)
 * Also looking for an in-game shotcaller

We're interested in players with a good standing in solo queue (Plat1 and above). As well as having the right mindset as to improve and learn (both personally and as a team). 
We want players with great attitudes, we don't want to be limited, we want to be limitless.

**Right now we're two players who can offer you:**

* Critical thinking
* Meta adaptive but also want to be innovative
* Want to improve as a unit

We're currently:

* D5 ADC - aZies
* P1 Top (Willing to go support if the right top laner comes along) - Artesh

**Team schedule:**

Our team schedule will be planned to around 3-4 days with team practice around 3 hours per session (some days could have multiple sessions). As well as extra days for tournaments (Go4LoL, we will be on the lookout for scrim partners who can offer matches on a similar/greater level.

**Apply:**

I'm looking for an active 5v5 team to play regularly on, though I'll play any role if needed. I want to join a team that will play more than once, since the last few teams I've joined have not played any games since they first day we played.

If you need someone or have any questions message me on here or in-game.
