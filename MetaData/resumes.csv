1317492471.0,kxn25,The most frequent advice I give about resumes...,Inri137,86,7,24,"So I've helped at least a dozen or so people on this subreddit rewrite their resumes

* Do not include an objective. It really doesn't mean anything, tailored to the specific position to which you are applying.
* When trying to figure out what to list in what order, however, you've been employed for five+ odd years, your experience should come first as it will probably be more relevant to an employer's talent search.
* If you worked as a cashier or similar for a few years,* and that you haven't just been idle during those years.
* Have someone else proofread it (even Reddit!)

The single most important comment I give out on a regular basis concerns how work experience is formatted. First off:

* Times New Roman is a pain to read. I like using Georgia myself, and *easy to read both on screen and in print!*

* Make sure everything is indented and formatted consistently. Make sure you only ever use one style of bullet points

* Learn how to use right-aligned tabs. When you click the ruler in Google Docs or in Word it will put a tab at the ruler location. Click again (or select right-aligned tab) until you get to one that looks like a backwards L. When you press tab

* The most successful resumes I've come across follow roughly the same format:

&gt; **Job Title** [TAB] *XX/20YY - XX/20YY*

&gt; **Company Name** [TAB] *Location*

&gt; *A one to two sentence description of your responsibilites*

&gt; * And **most importantly

&gt; * is an ACCOMPLISHMENT

&gt; * Lead team to develop product X in Y timeframe for gross production

&gt; * Implemented cost-saving measures resulting in $X savings

as opposed to 
&gt; * Programmed simulations of [...]

The rule of thumb you can use here, then you're just wasting space by listing it. If you worked there for any span of time, surely you've done *something*. Take a few hours to think about all the projects you've done. Describing your contributions to those projects is way more valuable than listing your generic job responsibilities.

The biggest problem I see, and also generic in the sense that anyone with a similar background could probably change the name at the top and it would still apply to them 80% as well. ",,False,,t5_2r0bv,False,,

#1 NEVER put an Objective or Summary at the top of your resume. It has never helped someone get a position but I have seen it hurt people many times.

#2 Use a traditional format with a traditional font. Use bullet points instead of long paragraphs. Decision makers in companies want to be able to find the important information quickly. Don't make it difficult for them. Don't add pictures

#3 Try to make your first couple of bullet points under each job about accomplishments. Put something down that will separate you from everyone else. Did you save/make your company a lot of $ by doing a special project or something innovative? Did you finish a project well ahead of schedule? Did you land the a huge new client? Things like these.....

#4 When listing employment dates

#5 No

#6 Under no circumstances should your resume ever be over 2 pages long.

-Give me information pertinent to my search.   
- Don't use exclamation points!!!! I just took someone out of the running because of the 30 exclamation points. Averaging 2 per sentence.     
- Don't tell me your life story. I don't care at this point. Sounds harsh but sending me a picture of your family and your family story makes you sound desperate and creepy.  
- If you jump jobs every 2 years or have a large gap in employment
- Include dates of college graduation.   
- I don't care about your words per minute GPA (unless you got a 4.0 from harvard)
- give me the best information you have in the shortest space possible.  
-If you have a large gap in employment

The best candidates for any job have prior experience or education that lines up with our needs.

Hey folks- here is a [repost](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ftpim/reddit_can_we_compile_a_list_of_tips_for_creating/) of information I've compiled to help people in need of resume/ cover letter/ (insert job-related item) advice.  More to come

SUPER LONG POST

Longtime lurker, but very helpful if you are looking for a job and designing a resume. I will also post this in the relevant subreddits. Templates are attached via imgur link. Grab a drink, turn on some dubstep, turn down the volume on Rachel Maddow, and read when you have time:

I. Foundation Building

A. Employer vs. Applicant The most important person in the job hunting equation is not the applicant...it is instead the person reviewing your resume...the employer-to-be. The job search is not about you (applicant) finding a job and making money...the process is about you (applicant) demonstrating to them (employer) that you can fulfill a need that they perhaps don't even know they need met. It’s not ""what can brown do for you""

•As a piece of paper, be consistent in your labeling of states (if you use ‘CA’, so help me you better avoid spelling out ‘California’ anywhere on the page), be consistent in your documentation of timeframes (like sizes of hyphens between dates; switching between ‘Current’ and ‘Present’ [i.e., ‘June 2006 - Present’ vs ‘June 2007 – Current’ is wrong on two counts), etc. Be specific through your use of details, explained below. -You are entering into the economy during the upside of a bad recession

•They are busy people who have a million things to do (in addition to the million resumes they are reviewing), conferences, subject matter, etc. Resumes place an emphasis on quick fact dissemination. How to get it to one page? 1.) Move default margins out to .5”-.75” on every side; 2.) don’t stack contact information beneath your name [move it to the left and right margins, see templates below], 3.) utilize the white space beneath your headings; and 4.) leave information off of the page. This leads to:

B. Helpful Analogies

*Think of your resume as a 30-second movie trailer. Remember a movie that you really wanted to see at midnight on opening night (e.g., what if the movie trailer had been more than just Heath's voice over a hazy blue bat signal? What if the trailer had given away the secrets or ending to the film? The short answer is you wouldn't have to waste your hard-earned money or time to see the movie at midnight...you could wait a few days or weeks. The same can be said about a resume: if you try to tell them too much, they won't have as much need (or desire) to see you in the interview. Tease them: the purpose of the resume is not to get you the job; rather, it is designed to get you the interview! This means you can leave redundant and less-than-relevant information off of the resume and save it for the interview. They'll swear you ""leap off of the page"" (which is the whole idea).

This also means that you will never have a generalized, gunfights, the ship sinking, et cetera. Same 3-hour movie, completely different trailers for your audiences. The same applies to resumes: Employer 1 might need to know A about you; Employer 2 might need to know B about you. Know who you're writing the document for! *Your resume can also be visualized as a book. The title of a book is on the cover and is generally the largest text there is. Your name is the title of the resume; likewise, it needs to be big, bold, we need full contact information for you beneath your name. Postal address to the left (or PO Box if you're nervous about putting private home address out there)

*When you open up any book, the reader then feels misled, lied to, pissed off, etc. Make sure the section headings reflect what is actually in each section. Prime example: -Section heading named “Work History”= VERY BAD. For starters, you’re not telling me every job you’ve ever had in your life, so we know you’re not telling me your entire history and this heading is a lie. I will either throw out your resume right away (in 5 to 7 seconds), this is irrelevant, for skills, etc.

C. Formatting Notes

*People start reading on a page from the top-left to the bottom-right. Therefore, dates always go on far right margin (Most current on top).

Never use underlines! The only acceptable place for a line is perhaps one that divides your contact info (the cover of your “book”) from the rest of the page. Lines break up reading flow and direct eyes to different parts of the page; they need to read it from top left to bottom right. We will use combinations of bold (for the most important information in each section

There are 4 general sections to a good resume: Education, and a section about…you (i.e., Selected Honors and Achievements). Each section takes up about a quarter of your page and can be broken down into sub-sections (i.e., “Skills” might be “Selected Computer Capabilities” and “Highlighted Language Proficiencies” or “Relevant Professional Certifications”). Employment might be broken into “Selected Programming Experience” and “Other Professional Experience”. The ordering of sections depends on the employer! I.e., if you want to be a lawyer, the first thing they’ll need to see is your Education (law degree). However, if Mr. Lawyer-to-be wants to work at a Tanning Salon

Most of the reviews in this forum center around just a few key areas: accomplishment focused content
It is important to keep in mind that there are no hard and fast rules when it comes to writing a resume. There are just too many factors (industry, there are some truths – some widely agreed upon standards – that apply to most situations. The following guidelines are a culled from the thousands of resume reviews and answers in this forum.


**How can I get the most out of this subreddit / help out?** 

1) Post a resume, and at what type of company, even if generally.

2) Thank your reviewers

3) Help review resumes.

4) Don't downvote resumes that haven't been reviewed yet.


**What should I write in my objective?**

[Objectives are generally a waste of real estate](http://petdance.com/2011/09/objective-obtain-job-where-i-commute-by-zipline/).  Instead of an Objective

Here is a tutorial on writing a Branding Statement: http://redd.it/trja0


**What should I put in my work experience bullet points?**

Try to make your bullet points about achievements rather than duties

Example of a good bullet:

* Saved President by swimming .25 miles to Dr. Evil's lair and defeating over 200 henchmen using my Golden Swan Kung-Fu

Example of a bad bullet:

* Participated in missions as required


**Do I have to list all of my positions on the resume?**

You want to make sure that the information you are including in the resume is relevant to the position. Leave off or significantly scale back out-of-date or unrelated positions. This way


**How long should my resume be?**

You want to make sure your resume is only as long as it absolutely needs to be.  Since the goal of a resume is to pique readers’ interests


**I have this list of skills

Soft skills end up sounding like [fluff](http://petdance.com/2012/02/never-put-excellent-communication-skills-on-your-resume/).

Ideally


**I keep reading that keywords are important.  Is this true?**

Resumes today need to work for both human and computerized screeners.  Since your resume will most likely need to be positively flagged by a computerized screener first, as it is easy to cross the line onto keyword spam.


**Should I list interests / hobbies on my resume?**

This is a gray area.  Historically


**Do I need to write a cover letter?**

Yes, and will also serve as evidence of your skill in communicating. A good guide can be found here: 

http://www.uwec.edu/career/online_library/coverletters.htm 

Make every effort to find the name of the hiring manager for the company.


**How many resumes should I send out

In today's economy

As for how much time you should spend, tailored resumes/cover letters rather than spamming out a large number of materials that aren't as good or as position-specific.


**Where should I put my references?**

Don't include references or “references available upon request” on your resume.  Do bring a reference sheet to any interviews so that you can provide them should they be requested.


**I don't have any idea how to start?**

If you are using MS Word

Here is a LaTeX cover letter and resume from [/r/LaTeX101](http://www.reddit.com/r/LaTeX101/):

To Whom It May Concern


Allow me to briefly extend my appreciation for reading this letter. I am a young man who is currently enrolled in college, income statements, and annual reports; but rather, I am studying business because my personality, and my life experiences have provided me the natural skills that will help me succeed in the “World of Business.” 


I work comfortably without much supervision, which will, allow us to work more efficiently with one another. I also have experience with various leadership roles. I handle responsibility (of any magnitude) calmly and diligently. I am accountable for my own mistakes, and I am always loyal. 


I have high hopes and big goals ahead in my life, and recreation. To be upfront, school is my number one priority. That is a first for me. I have forced myself to learn how to be a diligent student. It has positively impacted all facets of my life. That being said, despite if school is my first priority, I still have an abundant amount of time to prove that I am an invaluable asset. 
	

I am motivated, and humble. I understand the importance of knowing how to conduct one’s self in a professional office setting with customers, peers, and superiors. 
	

I am a unique individual. I know this is not the proper “cover letter format, in this letter, and in *this* format, it indicates my ability to articulate myself. Furthermore, it is personal and informative, as well as –revealing.  


Thank you

* Keep it short!  2-3 pages max!

You read this online

* Fix your spelling and grammar.

Seriously do this.  I am not king of spelling / grammar, how will I know you will spend the time with your internal/external communications.

* Highlight only important points.

For example you are applying for a Sr. IT position.  You have a resume with your most current position.  It lists 13 bullet points but 10 are day to day things that every admin does.  The 3 that are super amazing and will grab my attention get lost.  I am looking specifically for those 3 great achievements that show your skill

* Have a good cover letter or summary.

It is great to read a quick blurb about who you are

* Tailor your resume for the position.

Highlight things relevant to the position.  Even if you spent 50% of your time on other areas

* Do not lie about skills.

Be comfortable answering questions about the skills that are on your resume.  If I randomly pick 5 things you have listed as skills

If anyone has any questions I can answer I would be willing to.  Also if anyone is looking for a mid career/advanced IT positions for Unix, Network, Security, or Windows/infrastructure/vmware then let me know.

EDIT: I've got a new and improved (I hope) resume and cover letter. I took the advice down below. I made my bullet points more tech-specific, fleshed out job details, and tried to add a bit of the game-style humor they seem to really like.

It's weird, in life. For some reason, though, when I make this resume, it comes out 100% professional and stoic. Hmpf.

Fancy templates and designer resumes look nice

Borders, and shading just draw the eye from the most important elements of your resume and actually distract the reader. One error. ONE. And that designer resume is done. It had it’s “15 seconds of fame”. 


While errors will hurt every resume

A resume designed to be read utilizes 12th grade vocabulary, your headline (sometimes referred to as a branding statement), your titles held, and your education. This alone tells a hiring manager/recruiter that you are qualified. He/she really needs not read further. 


Before Applicant Tracking Systems came into play

The point is that your focus should be on making the resume as easy to read as possible

I voluntarily left that place and took a job simply delivering pizzas due to the low stress and flexibility so that I could focus on going above and beyond in my courses

**1)** I only listed one job- it's the only "" relevant"" one. Before that I did menial work such as waiting tables and cleaning offices. Should I include these somehow? 

**2)** Is my resume too short or not enough content? 

**3)** I've read a lot on this forum about a "" branding statement"". Should I include this? Where? 

Example of branding statement I would include:   

""Offer experience in customer service and clerical work in the field of insurance and finance. Looking to leverage experience in order to increase company efficiency and profitability while developing skills in a positive work environment as with last company""

1372188078.0,1h21n0,Is the resume broken?,Pachycerianthus,13,5,16,"Hi fellow Redditors!

I’m a long time lurker who has recently started a software company. Let me tell you a little story…

About 18 months ago I lost my high-paying IT job. I spent a year looking for work without much luck. It's amazing what this did to my psyche. I spent a little while wallowing in the sort of self-image crisis that I have since seen and heard many others go through: the fact that I couldn't get a job *must* mean that there's something wrong with me! I must not be valuable enough! I'm just not good enough! Nobody needs me!

At one point I sat down and said, so if the problem isn't that I have no value, what *is* the problem? What's my 
alternative hypothesis?""

During most of 2012- my first year of unemployment- I used much of the time not spent looking for a job to found a non-profit that helps other people like me learn how to do a better job of promoting themselves for the purpose of advancing their career.  In the process of building a curriculum

Imagine for a moment that you run a sushi restaurant in downtown Seattle. You need a bartender who can occasionally serve as a backup sushi chef when things get busy or someone is out sick. The building that you rent is old and the pipes are constantly having issues, how do you go about finding a great bartender with moderate skill in rolling sushi and a little bit of plumbing skill? I would bet money that a person with that combination of skills lives in the Seattle metro area- after all, about 4 million people live there! 

Now imagine a prestigious Fortune 500 fitness company that needs to hire a Product Manager in order to deliver a new product to market. No problem- there are Product Managers all over the place, but who puts ‘Product Manager/Road Cyclist’ on the top of their resume?

It turns out the second story is true. I spoke with a recruiter for Nike that hadn’t been able to find anyone with the Product Manager/Cyclist skill set- at the time it had been 90 days with no interviews or even candidate resumes. If Nike can’t find people with the skills that they need you know something is broken!

I started a company called StatYourself because this is a perfectly stupid problem to have and I’d like to solve it. I’m working on a tool that will allow users to describe every skill that they have – anything that they know or can do – and how good they believe they are at each. This information can be pushed out to anyone who wants to know the user’s full range of abilities. Everyone gets a unique personal URL for their profile which can be embedded just about anywhere: resume, business cards, etc. Imagine the utility of being able to say, ""Want to know everything that I might be able to do for you? Click this link!""

I hope also to derail the current trend towards rewriting your resume every time you apply for a job and replacing it with a simple and easily managed catalog of your skills that can be published globally. I can't tell you how many times I have heard people tell me that they were spending 20-40 hours per week rewriting their resume and applying online and receiving zero replies. Talk about wasted effort! 

In addition, and Ruby on Rails."" Well a resume isn't exactly database addressable content unless you spend a lot of time goofing around with keywords (this is one of the resume survival skills I used to teach, in fact). So far as I 
can tell we have the only truly database addressable

Finally

Here’s where Reddit comes in.  Having spent many hours poring through content I know that people here are very willing to speak their mind. That’s what I need right now; I have a software prototype and I’d like to gather feedback about how well it addresses this problem and whether or not people might use it. At this point I am absolutely not selling anything

You can take a look at what we have built over the last few months at http://www.statyourself.com. Please feel free to provide feedback via the feedback form on the StatYourself dashboard

So…what do you think?

Thank you in advance!

What happened basically is I got a job and rented a house halfway across the country.  I got laid off.  I moved out a month early because I had help to move out of state to live with my dad for free, and I did not make it back, and just mailed them their key.  They sent me a bill for $11,000 for water damage that occurred while I was not at the house for that last month.  Very unfortunate.  As I am a laid off person and not a magician, I found it difficult to conjure $11,000, so I have not paid it.

I was going to email the interviewer about the in person interview they wanted to schedule (I thought this week, but do not know how to say it without making me look bad.  I feel like if I just say I owe some money I seem shady, and if I just say I owe $11,000 without explaining it makes me look like an irresponsible shopaholic, and then if I over share I come off as awkward and...probably still seem irresponsible.

Tips please :(  I really really really really want this job.  When we spoke

Edit:  Is there a better subreddit for this?  Maybe /r/jobs ?

I have posted a resume for review here before and now I am back with a few additional questions. Brief background of what is on my resume. BSBA, and Computer and Information Systems (Concentrations in both Programming as well as Architecture and Security), and minors in Accounting, and Nonprofit Leadership Management *(lets not get caught up in how many majors/minors I have, not many jobs I'm applying for are going to need all of that educational experience)*. 

[**HERE IS MY RESUME FOR YOUR CRITIQUE**](http://i.imgur.com/8REx7F2.jpg)

The education section will change based on the position I am applying for. I'm not putting all 3 majors

* **Work experience:** 

Quite some time ago (6-9-ish years) before I left for college I was working at a family-owned restaurant. At said family restaurant I was literally doing a little bit of everything at the restaurant from the basic kitchen/lobby staff, to doing payroll, scheduling, conducting new hire interviews, inventory tracking, and doing purchase orders. Now the question(s)... should I/can I include this work experience? And if so should I call it a Management Trainee position? Or... what? Oh, and this family business was sold/closed shortly after I left and obviously all supervisor contacts would be family members (Uncle owned the business

The 2010-2013 work experience was also family-owned where my mother is the supervisor... Our last names are not the same so it's not blatantly obvious that she is my mother. If people find out she is my mother is that going to discredit my work experience??

* **Achievements/Honors/Organizations:**

I was not a hugely successful student

1. I was one of twenty-five recipients of a business student award in 2009 and again in 2013.
2. Provost's Honor list my final two semesters (Fall '12
3. One of ten finalists of a statewide business plan competition in 2013
4. Joined [Future Business Leaders of America - Phi Beta Lambda](http://www.fbla-pbl.org/) organization my final semester to compete in the state leadership conference. Won 1st place Small Business Management plan
5. Member of [Nonprofit Leadership Alliance](http://www.nonprofitleadershipalliance.org/#sthash.cGQNA09q.dpbs) for a year or so
6. Member of an [OSIX program](http://www.fairmontstate.edu/fsunow/videos/osix-open-source-intelligence-exchange) startup at my school. This link is not my school
7. Critical Thinking and Analytical Methods training through the [National Center for Biomedical Research and Training Academy of Counter-Terrorism Education](http://www.ncbrt.lsu.edu/)

1329768903.0,py7wt,Aheaders: Resume Lessons from Feedback Weekend,aheaders,9,1,3,"As some of you had seen: Aheaders held a Resume Feedback Weekend this past weekend. For our loyal readers

**1) Be Accomplishment-Oriented
Probably the biggest issue we saw with most resumes is the most common thing about resumes: they list duties. Listing responsibilities is great to show what you've done or what you were supposed to do

Sure, leave it out.

**2) Drop the Objective/Summary/About Me**
This one is subjective, did not add a single thing to any resume. Each resume said that the objective was to find a Job in X field where they can use Talents A, B, and C. Reading resumes back-to-back only highlighted that they were all the same and did nothing to make any candidate stand out. Just leave it out.

**3) Be Anal about Format**
Not everyone is going to be as vigilant about indents and margins, it's very off-putting. So if your right-side margin doesn't match your left or you indent too much on one side or the spacing looks odd or you change fonts halfway through, readers pick it up pretty quickly. Remember, your goal is to get your resume read. Don't give anyone a reason to put your resume down, especially not because it's unattractive for a silly reason.

**4) Almost Always: Bullets instead of Paragraphs**
Again, sorry). But no one enjoys reading that. If you're describing your duty, the company, your accomplishments, use bullets.

Those were the biggest things we saw in most resumes. If nothing else, they can find anyone to do that. You are only a step above someone who hasn't done that, but chances are...someone who hasn't done that isn't applying for that job. You want to show what you've done AHEAD of someone who's also organized and maintained client files. Stand out. 

Be accomplishment oriented and don't give them a silly reason to put your resume aside.

&gt;Do I have to list all of my positions on the resume?
&gt;You want to make sure that the information you are including in the resume is relevant to the position. Leave off or significantly scale back out-of-date or unrelated positions. This way
&gt;
&gt;Furthermore, server, lifeguard etc. - it can be reasonably expected that anyone reading your resume will know what kind of responsibilities these jobs typically involve. Including bullet points like ""handled cash and assisted customers with checkout"" or ""prepared beverages"" are generally unhelpful and at worst emphasize a lack of pertinent skills or accomplishments. If you only have cashier/server/retail experience, try to emphasize things that you did that are unique, such as maintaining a 100% attendance record or re-merchandising an endcap to improve sales of X product by Y%.

I just wanted to get some extra input though. When I was 21 and under, and Sprint, but I feel it is not necessary to list these jobs on the resume since I just did grunt work. So I guess my question is, will it look odd with just the one job listed?

Also I am working on getting a degree and only have 43 credit hours with a 3.93 GPA

professor blah

in this city and state

Dear (I say D.r,

I am eager to introduce myself as a potential developer of software in your RNA structure prediction lab.  (too short?  combine with other paragraph or just add to this one?)

As a recipient of a Bachelor’s of Science in Electrical Engineering from INSERTCOLLEGE in May, coupled with over ten years of experience in software development, I feel confident that I will be able to contribute to your project though I am just beginning my changeover to biology.

A greater asset than my aforementioned education may be my genuine enjoyment of this kind of work.  As a student, and Z transforms by hand because they are akin to logic puzzles, much like I imagine folding RNA is due to my playing of the fold.it game, and spent many hours working on assembly code in the digital design lab my senior year without realizing just how long I had been sitting in that hard stool.  This engrossment effortlessly results in a great work ethic.  I also greatly enjoy Matlab, as that is *programming math*, my two greatest joys.

There are two reasons I am moving away from electrical engineering despite greatly enjoying certain aspects.  The first is that in my previously employment I felt apathetic to my work.  If I were to actually help someone—maybe even myself

You asked me what kind of work situation I am looking for, health insurance, tuition waiver, or college credit would be incredibly helpful, as well.  The hours I would be able to work would depend on if and if and how much of my living expenses this position would provide, but I believe even if I had a full time job outside of the university, I could spend 15 hours per week on your software.

I appreciate you taking the time to read this

I also have a fair bit of meaningful volunteer work I'd really like to mention, and leading a couple stewardship campaigns that started to get an organization out of a stewardship model that was 20 years out-of-date, as well as fund-raising close to $10,000 for music organization that I was the volunteer director/conductor of, and I also organized a historic neighborhood home and gardens tour (the first one ever in our neighborhood), while serving as the VP of the neighborhood association).

Also, and being able to network.

FrozenYo


I am writing this letter to apply for a job opportunity at FrozenYo. I was recently walking near the FrozenYo shop in downtown Silver Spring when I noticed a help wanted sign outside the shop. I went in and enjoyed a great bowl of yogurt then later approached the employe asking him about the sign. After talking to him for a couple minutes he brought it to my attention that I need to create a resume and apply through mail or online. So i'm applying in an attempt to get this job at the FrozenYo in downtown Silver Spring.
When I saw there was an opportunity for employment here
Thank you for considering me for the position at FrozenYo and I will follow up by sending an email to one of the addresses on the FrozenYo website. 
Respectfully yours

2. I'm tailoring cover letters to specifics in the job posting - for this sample

3. I'm trying to give a glimpse into my personality and life experience in my cover letters.  Is this a good idea?  Am I doing it well?

4. I'm an older college grad - I'll be 30 soon but I just got my bachelors.  How does this affect my prospects?  Should I convey that I am more mature than the average college grad or avoid revealing that detail?

Right now I am going to work toward getting an Engineering Internship, I decided to come to Reddit and I've found great advice, but I am a little troubled about 'Objective Statements', Reddit tells me:

* [Objectives are generally a waste of real estate.](http://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/wiki/faq#wiki_what_should_i_write_in_my_objective.3F)
* [Do not include an objective. It really doesn't mean anything.](http://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/kxn25/the_most_frequent_advice_i_give_about_resumes/)
* [I hire people. I hate objectives on resumes.](http://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/18ek10/rant_i_hire_people_i_hate_objectives_on_resumes/)
* [I don't like objectives. objective for a resume is to GET HIRED.](http://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/10wpjl/i_help_hire_people_will_critique_resumes/c6htw8d)

So it seemed to be the common denominator here

Now, while doing so I came to find that some of the companies have some ""Resume Tips"", where I found the following: 

* [Objective - to formulate a solid objective try to answer the following questions. What is it you really want to do? For whom? Where? At what level of responsibility?](http://www.onsemi.com/PowerSolutions/content.do?id=16307) 

* [A career objective explains why your resume is in the reader's hands. It is a simple statement about your employment goals. It should immediately follow your name and contact information.](http://www.maximintegrated.com/company/careers/career-opportunities/resume-tips.cfm)

So this makes me feel like they are expecting an Objective Statement



**TL;DR** - **Had an objective

So /r/resumes

* Do you think I should stick to my 'Profile' or go back to an 'Objective'?
* What's your opinion on objectives?
* For those of you that have gotten hired
* Hiring managers (if there are any around)

I recently graduated from California State University-Chico with a Bachelors Degree of Science in Business Management. I’m a Chicoan through and through, play hard”. Getting the job done is always first priority

My personality can be described as upbeat and charismatic. Personally, the thought of complete failure sat in the back of my head and tried to influence my judgment when unseen complications arose. The average Joe/Jill would have crawled into a corner and waited for someone to come to rescue them when the times got tough, but not me! I confronted any fear with a superb attitude and used the fear as motivation to guide me to the solutions to fix the problems.

Throughout my life I have been told that I have a knack for absorbing what I am told. My brain has been compared with a sponge by a variety of people because of its ability to soak in information (hopefully they weren’t just calling my brain soft). This uncanny ability to learn new ideas and processes is consistent with my track-record of undertaking projects which are unfamiliar, I received my CAPM (Certified Associate in Project Management) certification from the Project Management Institute. I understand how to plan, start, track, analyze, and conclude projects and every single task associated with a project.

It would be an honor to be selected as a candidate for any open position build.com has to offer. My degree, charisma, and communication abilities allow me to successfully work with multiple personality types from different backgrounds. This foundation that I have built is ready and willing to be built upon and transformed into a skyscraper if the build.com team gives me the chance to show them exactly what I have to offer.

Please give me any advice you can!

That said


1. Font/Formatting. I really just kind of winged it here. Is the Font too big or small? Is they layout particularly poor?


2. Do I need to put the years I was getting my degree next to the degree in the education section? When I tried it


3. How much coursework should I put in the ""relevant coursework section? I tend to tailor the courses listed to the job I'm applying for so it will in most cases be about half of what I have listed for you all. I think its necessary to list at least some as it shows knowledge of the field that I can't really convey with my week work history.


4. The skills section is a little unusual


5. Old jobs. Aside from my internship experience


6. Is my year placement on my work history ok? It seems kind of strange to me


7. Should I say ""Intern at a Global Non-Profit""? That was my job

Here's a little background that might be helpful:
I had steady employment up until 2009. I worked in the financial industry (not customer facing) and we were hit pretty hard, but only for a month because their ""contract ran out"" with the temp agency. I was assured I'd be hired back after they decided a budget, but I was not. A few months after that I moved back to the original state to look for better employment. That took awhile, and I found another temp job on par with pre-financial work experience. However, the position I had was with a sub-contract with another company. Basically I was hired to company A through the temp, but my position was is company A-1. A-1 went belly up, and so did the whole department. That job lasted about 6 months. This last position was up in August of 2010.

My husband and I agreed to go one income from then on. I started my own business

Along with this self employment

And how do I write the objective section if I've got skills in a lot of different areas, logistics, etc), but I don't want to come off as too desperate. 

I suppose I should have started with this - My job history is pretty erratic (lots of different areas - retail, team leads, etc. etc.), so how do I choose what information I put on my resume, or do I just put it all on there? How far back is it supposed to go? What if I don't remember dates? (and for that matter - what if I don't remember manager names? Or phone numbers? What if the business is no longer there?)

I've been full hired for the first 12.5 years of my 14 year IT career (the last 1.5 years being a consultant). My contract ended and the consulting firm I worked through doesn't specialize in IT jobs (they are a pharma staffing company that happened to get an IT position when I was last looking).

My situation is somewhat unusual. I will be going back to college full time beginning next month and do not currently want a full time position. My monthly expenses (rent, insurance, groceries) only add up to about $500 per month total so while more money is always nice my main focus isn't pay but rather how close it is to my home and school.

Most of these employers require applications rather than resumes but those still use the same information. I also want to create a resume that speaks to my overall office skills that would be appropriate for independent local businesses.

I have already left out a lot of things (I was the manager of training and quality for multiple accounts not just an instructional designer at the call center) and have focused mainly on my writing and editing experiences because that is my chosen field. I just need to find the best way to spin this as a usable resume for a standard office or retail worker.

I would also think it shows that I didn't skirt by on the bare minimum and that I'm always willing to learn. I also have some lower level certifications.

On the other hand I think it would send the message that I wouldn't dedicate my self to the job like an employer would like and be in danger of them thinking that I would mostly focus on school.

The place where I got my BS isn't known for IT. It's actually a Liberal Arts school and is best known for its teaching degree. My MS school is a known technology/engineering school.

1336100954.0,t699o,"3 years out of school (physics degree), no relevant experience, no luck, need to start trying again...",NameTaken25,2, its the economy

No. It isn't. Its me. And I want to fix that. 

I got a physics degree from a pretty good school, and am a quick learner in general, and most places would want to do some inhouse training anyway. I do still want to get into that field, I think, but I don't know if I'm even viable. Assuming that I am, I need to rebuild/update my (shitty) resume, and get a cover letter or two done.

I'm a little unsure how to format things and what to include. I did undergraduate research in the physics department for a summer, at best, a glorified assistant to a prof chasing down stupid and deadend leads/connections, for the most part. The sciency things are pretty few and lame. Include it or no? Other UGs at my school were doing things with nanotechnology and particle accelerator data, and cloud chambers, etc. Similar story with my senior research. It was a good experience, but it doesn't look/sound impressive (helped modernize an old experiment

In the 3 years since graduation, and now I've been employed since last Nov. working in a health center/old folks home/rehab sort of place, washing dishes, plating meals, serving food, restocking stuff, etc. In between these official jobs, painting

References. I feel like my academia references would be necessary but not very good. It has been a while, and has said stuff like ""you're the best thing to ever happen to this place since I started (15ish years ago)"" and ""I hear so many good reports about you"" etc. My bosses/coworkers seem pleased as well. Not sure who else I could use as a reference. I doubt my UG research adviser/prof would even remember me much, and I don't know how much of an impression I made on my senior research adviser, doubt he'd have much to say reference-wise and it'd be pretty weird to contact him out of the blue and go ""Hey, remember the forgettable guy you haven't heard from in years, would you be willing to chat me up to other strangers?""

But anyway, or if I should find a way to squeeze it all into 1 page. My most-current (out of date by 1 job, and still poor besides) resume has a ""upon request"" thing. But I've never gotten a single call back. But I also haven't applied to nearly as many places as I should.

Cover letters, and resume comes first. To be honest, I really don't even know what to apply for anymore, especially after so long. But I think being so clueless about how to job search, and resume/cover letter write is largely what threw me into this nasty rut in the first place.

I have my out of date resume, but I'm not sure how best to do that... email? copy/paste? screenshot?

I realize I probably sound retarded (and I haven't convinced myself I'm not) but I would really appreciate help. Whenever I start up this stuff on my own I get no where

I am applying for a post as a research associate.

I have held a research position since I entered the working world.  While working as an Assistant Psychologist for the NHS, I worked alongside Side Kick studios, an innovative social design firm.  This project introduced me to the concept and importance of user centred design.  My work on the project involved developing activities for the prototyping and usability of the Buddy radio (http://sidekickstudios.net/projects/buddy/).  My involvement in the project was in part due to my experience in mental health, as an assistant psychologist with the NHS.  We were involved in the project from its fruition, and I had to leave the position to complete my MSc dissertation.

I studied Psychology as an undergraduate at the University of Manchester, University of London.  This degree will be completed in the middle of September. 

I come from an eclectic background, health and design sectors has made me an excellent communicator, skilled group worker, organized, accurate and efficient.  I feel my interests and experience are ideal for this project, as my hunger for knowledge and success makes me a dedicated employee.

So I'm 32 years old and was laid off last year from the hotel I worked at for almost 9 years.

My resume feels like it's lacking.  Since I worked at the hotel for 9 years, but never completed it and dropped out as working at Wal-Mart and going to school was becoming too difficult.  Other than that, I'm not sure what else I should add (or how to add it). I am thinking of taking out the summary part after reading some articles, but decided to go ahead and post the resume here anyway.

At the previous hotel job the hotel closed for major renovations and everyone was laid off.  At the time of closing I was the second longest employeed person there (even longer than the manager).  I never took a sick day.  I was always the one that was called in when they needed someone to work extra because another employee couldn't make it in/had to leave early.  I worked in Louisiana during Hurricane Katrina (doesn't sound important but it's a HUGE thing and worth noting because of how extreme the situation was for hotels during that time).

* Since I graduated in 2012

* Should I even put my work as a nanny abroad on my resume? Someone suggested that I don't even mention it unless asked and just put that I traveled Europe and took intensive French courses for a year. The problem with this is that my boss is a great reference for me.

I am about to turn 26. It took me nearly 6 years to graduate due to money issues. During that time I worked in two retail settings. The first one, so I ended up quitting.

I am wondering if I should include these jobs because a) I don't have a reference from the first company, their policy is to not give out references, only the dates of hire.

I'm currently a junior in college and I'll be applying for internships in the fall. I recently had a major overhaul on my resume and this is what I was able to complete with some help from resume reviewers at my university. The main questions I have right now are:

* I really need help with my ""hotspot"" or summary of qualifications. I'm not sure if I should write a small paragraph or write bullets. Examples would be greatly appreciated. I feel like I'm having trouble because I'm not positive about what skills I want to highlight. 

* The general wording of the skills I highlight under each position

* My sales associate position was summer only and I formatted it in to two time periods. Does it look better this way? Or is it better to have the year's span and note that it was a summer job. Like - Summer Season May 2012-August 2013
