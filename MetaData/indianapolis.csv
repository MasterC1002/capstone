The committee chose to do it this way so that we could have correct numbers for food. Since they are providing meat


Here is the event information that is highlighted on the page to RSVP: 

**2013 Global Reddit Meetup Day is officially booked for June 15th from 3pm-Dusk**

We have a shelter house rented for the day at Paul Ruster Park (11300 E Prospect St, so make sure you attend!

If you are a Reddit meetup seasoned vet you should be here!

If you are a lurker who has never made it out to a meetup event yet...you should be here!

If you are new to the area and want to me like minded people...you should be here!!

If you just heard of Reddit yesterday but think it is awesome...then you should be here!

This is your chance to come and connect with a great group of people who share the same interests as you! Everyone is welcome including kids!

*There is going to be a suggested $5 donation to help cover the costs of renting the shelter house

**Here is what the planning committee is providing:**

-Paper Products (plates, table clothes, forks/spoons)

-Meat (burgers

-Drinks (ice

-Music (Eric will be bringing out his dj gear to spin some tunes)

 

**Here is what we need from all of you to make this successful!**

-Access to outlets


So

**Edits May 20th**
-Took out BYOB. We are going to go ahead and follow the park rules when it comes to drinking alcohol. Details of the after party (which include a pool and private residence) will be made available for those interested the week before the meetup. Those wishing to partake in adult beverages should attend the after party! The reddit meetup group has been known to throw some great house parties! Bottom line is: Better safe than sorry and since this is going to be a kid friendly event the planning committee thought it best to abide by park rules!

Just print out this page and show it to the box office. And they'll give you two free tickets to any show this weekend. Show up early since we better damn well be sold out. And show Jeff Garlin how great Indy can be?

I am an anthropology student. I study human mortuary ritual and see how our reactions to death tell about the way we live our lives. The books that were stolen were necessary for my senior thesis, which was taken from me while I was on vacation with my family. I’m mad as hell and incredibly upset. The thief didn’t touch my stereo, my GPS, or the credit card that I’d accidentally left in the front seat. He or she managed to make off with three bags, a $150 netbook, a disc drive, a wireless mouse, a Cthulhu puppet


Now, but not enough to make the theft worthwhile. Trust me on this. I know.  I know this is a long shot, but if you, or anybody else knows anything about these books, please contact me at cmonesmi@nd.edu. I don’t care about the electronics or the luggage. I just want those books back… even just the two notebooks. Those are worth nothing to you or anybody else who’s not me. I won’t be pressing charges… I won’t even ask for a full name. I will pay for shipping back to me. If you or anybody you know has information about these books, please contact me.

Since there is a super majority of Republicans in the House and Senate

The last time I talked to a staffer

What I found in Senator Brent Waltz was a reasonable, I found this in a Republican. I explained to him several different reasons why I believe it's a bad idea to vote for a constitutional ban on gay marriage for the state of Indiana. He conceded that I made very compelling arguments, but he was elected to represent the people of Indiana's 36th district. He was steadfastly convinced that, outside of his personal feelings on the matter, he would be representing the majority opinion in his district for voting in the affirmative. While I disagree with him that it really is the majority opinion in the district, I can respect the answer that he gave me. 

We talked for a good long while about policy and I asked him what I would have to do to convince him that this was not what his district wanted. I asked him how many people I would need to get in front of him to show that we care about this issue. He told me that in a district with 140, he compromised and promised me that he would put on his district survey the question ""Should there be an amendment to the Indiana constitution that defines marriage as between one man and one woman?"".

This was extremely reasonable and fair. While I assured him that I was still going to work my hardest over the next year to convince him that voting for this again would be a bad move

He told me that he will be having town halls again in the fall

I can honestly tell you that after talking to Senator Brent Waltz for a good long while

I urge everyone in the 36th district to call his office and be persistent until you get a chance to talk with him. I started the conversation expecting him to put up his fists and prepare for a fight

Transportation is not a problem for me. I wouldn't want to let my potential go to waste and work in a fast food restaurant but at this point I'm desperate.

I know this isn't the most terrible injustice in the world, and you're looking to ""make a difference"" but want something a little more rookie-level than [Peace Corps](http://www.peacecorps.gov/index.cfm?shell=learn), maybe do your own exploring, maybe ""downvote"" the suspect reviews (was this review helpful? yes/no), maybe flag them.  I wrote reviews at the Chrysler place and the kid's dentist pointing out the hinkyness of the other posts, but that felt like pissing into the wind so I come here instead.  Maybe you write your own reviews?  Maybe you upvote mine?  Maybe you just go buy your car somewhere else?  Maybe you go buy a pound of ground beef and make a nice spaghetti dinner?  I don't know.

I think this is something worth discussing

I know, and always external factors worth discussing.

But I'm starting to get really concerned about elevating violence in Indianapolis

I know

But this year

Now, etc. -- someone gets killed/shot/severely beaten.  Brawls are breaking out.  Generally, really concerning things are happening.

I don't have any easy questions or answers to ask here

Is this really a problem

Do you feel unsafe downtown now?  During major events?

Is it fair to say this is an ""urban youth"" problem?  What does that imply?  What are we comfortable admitting here, but figuring out the demographic most in need of an action plan here would.

What can be done to curb this violence

Is this a youth problem?  Policing problem?  Parenting problem?  Community problem?  Reminded of recent Indy Star op-eds essentially placing this on black community faith leaders for not being vocal enough

What is the solution to this problem

What must we absolutely avoid?

We were in the lead the first 4 rounds, but other teams of 4-8 people started beating our asses with the added brain power, so I figured why not see if any other redditors wanted to join up and form a giant braintrust? Doesn't have to be a weekly thing, can keep it casual, but I think it'd be a great idea to get r/Indy to mingle amongst ourselves for those of us who can't make it to the Friday night meetups. Anyone interested? We're a group of mid-to-late-twenty-somethings who enjoy beer and have a lot of useless facts stashed away in our heads.

1364785493.0,1beccf,Pedestrians &amp; Cyclists of Indy: Are you visible to drivers at night?,stgnet,18,4,26,"I just had a disturbing experience - while driving home this evening through Broad Ripple, it was dark and had been raining, and I thought better of trying to talk to somebody both upset and likely drunk.

This experience is part of a disturbing trend I have noticed around town: pedestrians and bicyclists out at night, and walking or biking along or across an unlit or dimly lit portion of roadway.  There has been numerous times in the last year that I have been scared out of my wits to come across someone at the last moment - usually but not always out of my direct line of travel, but close enough to be surprising and quite the adrenalin rush.  Jaywalking pedestrians is one thing (almost hit somebody the other day because they stepped out into a lane I was changing into) - but this lack of concern about crossing roads at night is going to get somebody hurt or killed - and I don't want to contribute to such a painful experience.

Please for the love of whatever you hold dear (and your own life) take a moment before stepping or riding onto any pavement and consider:

1) Am I visible?  Do I have light colored clothing on?  Something reflective?  Flashlight in my hand even?

2) When biking, BTW!

3) Do I see any cars on the road?  Note that you may not always HEAR cars anymore, get off the roadway or duck behind a non-moving object (like a parked car).  And: don't presume the car will stay in the same lane!

4) Is there overhead streetlights?  Is the area well lit?  Is there bushes or anything that would obstruct the driver's view of me?

5) How busy is the road I'm about to travel?  How fast do the cars travel on it?  Can I take an alternate road or stay on a sidewalk to avoid higher traffic areas?

We applauded the multiple succinct plays of the Indians. They truly seemed to be firing on all pistons



Of course, large chicken-sandwich-promoting-cows were denounced for their bigoted agenda (Apparently, Chick-Fil-A hates chicks that fill vajays, and by that I mean that they're quite against any non-hetero-stuff), and a guy with $5,000 worth of cameras told a joke that took like 3 solid minutes to pull off. He nailed it though... Kinda. I, for one

----

The place was alive with an interesting crowd, when the Indianapolis Indians decimated the Rochester Red Wings. *(I was too inebriated to know for sure that that's who they played). It really wasn't even close. We reveled in the almost cartoonishly lopsided score, before saying our goodbyes and parting ways.

Reddit Meetup Level: Success.

Stop by next time!  I know I will.

1.  Get a place that has reservations and more accessible parking.
2.  Ask for separate checks ahead of time (although after talking with the waiter after everyone left he said even if I would've asked he would've printed out the ticket the same way)
3.  Someone tell me where you guys are going after I clear the checks if you're going to drink! :)
4.  Walking to my car at midnight with roughly 240 dollars in cash makes one much more paranoid than usual.

Apart from being excited for the move

We have lots to do in preperation

**CARS**:


We need to buy 2 cars pretty soon upon arrival.  Budget is about $20-30k per car.  I'd mused at getting something sporty (350z, but I'm worrying about the weather and managing with a powerful RWD car.

 - Are there any car dealer redditors that would be interested in talking to me?  I'm wagering we can get a good deal from the necessity to buy 2 cars in very close proximity to one another.

 - How often does it snow in Indy?  Does the snow maintain on the ground for the Winter season or does it fully thaw between snow falls? Do I NEED a AWD/FWD car or would a RWD be okay?

 - Any recommendations on good cars to buy in that price bracket?  Most the cars are different from USA to UK


**HOUSING**:

So upon arrival we'll have to rent somewhere until we have settled a bit and seen the area and made sure we're comfortable for the long term. We've done some research and the following areas seemed nice:

- Broad Ripple
- Carmel
- Fisher

Broad Ripple sounded good for socialising and being in a vibrant area. We're 28 &amp; 26, so we're going to be looking to move to somewhere which is furnished initially.  If anybody has any ideas of good areas, developments etc that would be suitable, please let me know!  Also, we have a [small dog](http://winstonken.wordpress.com/) so would have to be suitable to keep him there.



**HOTELS**:

Upon arrival in town, decent quality but not ridiculously expensive. Any suggestions?



**JOBS**:

I need to start looking for a job in Indy

Alternatively, security hardware/software companies in the area that would be good to look into?  /EDIT: I actually work in marketing.  My Last job was Marketing Manager for a tech firm (Surveillance Hardware &amp; Software), so as much as I appreciate the IT tips, they're not 100% relevant).

1319506497.0,lnueg,Haunted House Review - Necropolis,rickscarf,12,0,1,"Just got back from [Necropolis](http://www.darkarmies.com/necropolis-haunted-house/index.html)

Without giving any spoilers away, but I've heard it can be up to a 2 hour wait depending on the night you go. Good atmosphere to make for a tolerable wait, though.

The main event is Necropolis, which is nice. All of the effects and actors were well-done, you can tell they had an eye for detail and made sure there was a twist around every corner. The actors do not touch you (apparently a HUGE concern to the high school girls behind me, they asked like 5 times while the rules were being explained) but they are numerous and pop out to scare you often. Plenty of high-tech effects with lighting, LCD panels, pneumatics etc, as well as good old-fashioned dudes jumping out behind you. This portion of the combo we did lasted approximately 15 minutes.

Next we did the Zombie Inn, but I will say that nothing during the evening especially scared or surprised me but I did smile once I figured out what was going on in this event because I definitely was tricked by the psych out it surely intended to create. They probably wouldn't do it for all groups or couples, but since I was there was my bro there was a divide and conquer involved in the mystique, and I ended up getting through the Zombie Inn quite a bit faster than he did. Luckily for me they planned on this, and I got to be involved in a bit of planned one-on-one time with an actor to make sure I was entertained while waiting on him. This particular actor, a mad scientist, was my favorite actor of the night hands down. Great sense of humor, but I could also tell he was quick-witted and throwing out some of his material on the fly which was awesome. The Zombie Inn takes approx. 7-12 minutes to get through depending on the speed of your group.

Last was the Dark Terrors tour, but overall the gimmick worked pretty well and created a nice eerie feeling to what is otherwise a quality haunted house tour. They could've done a lot more with the effect, maybe a total darkness room with wind machines or strobe effects, but they did a pretty good job and I would recommend checking it out. I think this tour took us about 10 minutes to get through.

Overall I'd say it would be a good value for the price and would recommend it. I went to Hannah House last year and enjoyed that one as well,000 sq feet?). I'd be happy to answer any questions you may have; I'm not sure there are spoiler tags on reddit, but if you have a possible spoiler question feel free to PM me.

Also... WHY IS THE SOCIAL SERVICES DIVISION SO RIDICULOUSLY DIFFICULT TO GET AHOLD OF VIA PHONE?!

I'm also probably going to need help in getting moved to the new apartment... but that'll come once I've narrowed down the search.

My requirements:
Must have high speed internet access... it's the only way I communicate to the world via computer.
Must have at least 2 or more bus lines close or on the streets by apts.

Budget: $200-500. I'd prefer electricity/gas be included in the rent... if at all. 2-bedroom? Small or large is OK... but I intend to have a roommate in to help split the bills in the next few months.

I'm just overwhelmed by all of this as I'd just moved here last year November and have yet to fully get caught up on things around here. I... to be honest... I'm getting really tired of the apparent streak of bad luck I'm rolling on. I need help
