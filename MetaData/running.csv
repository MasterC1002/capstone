1329932602.0,q15p3,You shouldn't be winded!,PKLKickballer,802,148,205,"I've seen a few posts this week from newer runners who are getting winded

First off

The real problem is actually the intensity, the issue is that you're going anaerobic to some degree.  That is, your muscles aren't getting the oxygen that they need at the rate they are using it.  They can operate for a while in a deficit, but pretty soon you'll be gasping for air and unable to continue.

So what to do?  Well, you can expect to breath a bit more heavily, but you should still be able to speak a sentence without too much trouble.

""But my body can run so much faster"", you probably have the leg muscles to move yourself at a nice pace without it feeling too hard.  The problem is that a chain is as strong as its weakest link.  In this case, your muscles are at one end of the chain and your lungs are at the other.  In between are red blood cells that carry oxygen, a heart that moves them and capillaries that deliver those oxygen carrying cells to the muscles.  In a new runner, some or all of those links aren't as well developed as the muscles.  As a result, that oxygen just isn't getting there fast enough.

How do you fix this?  You just have to run more and do it at slower speeds.  With just a little bit of strain on the system

The good news is that this happens no matter what pace you're running!  By running slowly

These adaptions, the best thing you can do as a new runner is to run more at almost an exclusively easy pace.  With each easy run, you are increasing the ability of your body to work harder for a longer duration.  This translates into the potential to run faster for longer when you want to, like in a race.

So what about speed work?  Well, that will yield huge gains.  In fact those gains will be much more substantial and more sustainable than what you'll get from speed work.  As the returns start to diminish and you have a body with the ability to run much better than it once did, you can start doing speed work.  Intervals, tempos, fartleks, etc will allow you to come closer to the great potential you've built up.  The base you've built will help you do speed work much more effectively and with less chance of injury.  For beginners, though

**TL;DR**: Slow down

For the past 8 weeks I've been laid up from running by a heel Achilles insertional tendonosis that just won't improve no matter what I do.  Walking - no problem.  Running - can't do.    
I'm not here to whine, one you don't often appreciate until it's gone.  To be able to lace up your shoes, step out the door, and put 2, 5, 12 miles behind you without stopping - that's a pretty amazing thing.  Only runners know that feeling you can get when everything just clicks, and the strides seem effortless, doing what you were created to do.  Only runners know that good ache to the quads and calves and glutes that you feel each time you move the day after you've nailed a difficult long run.  And runners know that unique feeling of accomplishment when those difficult physical goals you've set for yourself
So for those of you headed out on a run today, really appreciate, how great a thing it is.  This running you're doing, it's a gift that isn't given to everyone.  And while at times it may seem more like a punishment than a reward, believe me, when it's taken away, you'll realize how much a part of you  and your sanity this simple act is.

I had a problem with it to say the least. It wasn't a major life ruining problem that some have

I hated myself for drinking so much. I hated myself for eating so much and just letting my health get out of hand. But I felt stuck. I didn't know what to do or more honestly I just didn't want to do what I knew I had to do.

That changed for me last August. I started a weight loss program at the local gym. I managed to shed the weight. Eating habits were better

That weight loss program had cardio in it which I hated

So after about 3 weeks, that is it soothed me, because I very much, even with the weight loss, good marriage, good job, thought of myself as a failure.

I was disappointed that I seemed to be losing those hard fought miles on the treadmill. I did my paltry 1 mile and felt horrible about it, dear friend waited on top of the refrigerator. It made me forget all my failures. It made me forget myself and I worshiped it for that. 

I then got off the treadmill. I decided it was just too painful of a device for me and looked for something else. I don't know why I passed up the ellipticals

1/7th of a mile indoor track. Ok, my first mile on the track! I promised myself if I got three miles I would enter a 5K. 

I got those 3 miles in about 2 months or so and ran my first 5K and loved it. It was fun and I had a time of 30:38 and a nifty tshirt which, didn't even have a great finishing time, but I did it. I achieved a goal.

It was suggested to me that I take my running outdoors by a friend of mine. Which I did and I loved it even more. Just being out in the world was inspiring to me. So I began to log three miles around the local college here and developed an actual running routine where I would run with some other people a few days and by myself on others. I entered more 5Ks and saw my times increase, 28:06. I started increasing my mileage and adding another run day to my week. 

You might have noticed that in the above paragraphs I haven't mentioned drinking. A funny thing happened about that. I used to crave the drink. It was a crying need in me. I used to run home after work just to open a bottle and get schloshed in 2 hours and ride it out until I passed out later that evening. I noticed in doing all this running

A bottle of whiskey would last me maybe 2-3 days, sometimes not at all for the whole month and never to the excess I once did. I have celebrated a new PR with a few drinks and a rowdy time, but now I would rather have water than anything else. Soda/pop even took a backseat. I have a diet soda/pop every now and then too, but again, I would rather see a big glass of ice cold water in front of me now than soda/pop. 

My long runs are 5 miles now which I will push to 6 miles come July 7th. There is a 10k in September around here that I think I will be running in too. I used to run home for the drink and now I am running home to tie on my running shoes and hit the road. I don't need the alcohol any longer. I have a 10K car magnet to earn now.

tl;dr Was a mess of a person and a functioning alcoholic. Running changed that.

**Why did you start to study the evolution of running and exercise?**


I got interested in how we hold our heads still when we run. It began when my colleagues and I were doing some experiments with pigs as models. It is very uncomfortable to watch a pig run: its head bobs all over the place. But animals that are good at running, because it is important for gaze stabilisation. We started thinking about humans and chimps, and came up with hypotheses about how we evolved head stabilisation to run.


**Why do you think head stabilisation evolved for running


If you watch someone with a ponytail running

Walking does not create such accelerations. And I don't think our ancestors were jumping on trampolines or hitting each other on the head so much. The only explanation we can come up with is running.

**Being able to run is one thing – how did we then go on to become endurance athletes?**


We evolved from very non-active creatures. A typical chimp will walk 2 to 3 kilometres a day, literally from our heads down to our toes, that make us really good at long-distance walking and running.

I and my colleagues at the University of Utah, whereby you run very long distances to chase animals in the heat and run them into heat stroke. We can run for very long distances, marathons in fact, at speeds at which other animals have to gallop. That's not an endurance gait for quadrupeds, because they cool by panting – short shallow breaths. You can't pant and gallop at the same time. If you make an animal gallop in the heat for 15 minutes or so, on a hot day, you'll kill it.

**But we have adaptations for this kind of endurance running?**


Yes. Our bodies are loaded with all kinds of features: short toes that require less energy to stabilise and generate less shock when running; the Achilles tendon that stores and releases energy appropriately as we run; the large gluteus maximus muscles that steady the trunk; and stabilisation of the head. I'm a middle-aged professor

**What's your best marathon time?**


[Laughs] 3 hours and 34 minutes. There are guys who can run almost twice as fast as me.

Still
I'd have dinner.

**Why


It was incredibly recently in history that a large number of humans have been freed from having to do physical activity. My argument, we compare people who are sick with controls. But who are those controls? They are relatively sedentary Westerners. I'd argue that we are comparing people who are sick to people who are abnormal and semi-pathological.


**If being inactive is pathological and abnormal


There was never any evolutionary selection pressure to make us like exercise. If you are a Neanderthal or Homo erectus or an early modern human, I'm going to go for a run so that I'm not going to get depressed"". They had to go long distances every day in order to survive. Not exercising was never an option, so there was never any selection pressure to make people like exercise. On the contrary, there was probably selection to help people avoid needless exercise when they could. Some hunter-gatherers had diets of about 2200 calories a day. When your energy intake is that low, you can't afford to go for a jog just for fun.

So evolution selected for traits that made us relax or be lazy?
Of course. Just like any time you crave sugary

When you walk into a train station and there is a staircase and an escalator, but it's probably a very deeply rooted evolutionary instinct.


**What are the consequences of the modern sedentary lifestyle?**


It's hard to think of one disease that is not affected by physical activity. Take the two major killers: heart disease and cancer. The heart requires exercise to grow properly. Exercise increases the peripheral arteries and decreases your cholesterol levels

Breast cancers and many other reproductive tissue cancers also respond strongly to exercise. Other factors being constant, the list is incredibly long.


**What can we do about our maladaptive traits?**


If we want to practice preventive medicine

If we are going to solve these health problems, we have to somehow agree that it's necessary or face the consequence – which is billions of unfit, overweight people.

Has evolution given us any instincts that promote exercise?
Yes. It's important to recognise that the body isn't adapted only in one way or another. There are multiple competing adaptations. While it's true that many of our instincts are to not like exercise

**What's the evolutionary advantage of the runner's high?**


Imagine you are chasing an animal, which is all about observation. You are looking for clues in the environment. What does a runner's high do? It makes everything more intense. It stimulates your perception and your sensory awareness.

I can give you an example: I ran the London marathon a few years ago, Big Ben is really big."" And then I remember thinking to myself, ""Oh, I must be high.""

What IS slow, running 2 miles, then 5 miles, then 10. When I started, I was a 15 minute miler. Over time, by just running consistently, I got faster. This happens for all of us, muscles get stronger


And say you're sick of that 15 minute mile pace and you do want to become faster. Well


Set your watch/phone to beep every minute and then start running. The first minute is a super easy

Simple and over time you'll start noticing that 15 minute mile is now a 12 minute mile and then a 9 minute mile. You've gotten faster!


Yet, ""I'm slow. 9 minute miles? Mr. Fasty-Pants runs 5 minute miles!"" How soon we forget all the work and dedication we've put into a task once we achieve a certain goal. We want to sell ourselves short and downplay the effort. Start denying yourself this empty comfort, stop putting yourself and your effort down. 


Running is about you and your effort on that day and not Mr. Fasty-Pants


So if you want to be faster, stay consistent and you will be. Lose the negative self-talk, too. Think of what goals you could accomplish by changing 'I can not.' to 'I can.' The omission of that one little word will make a world of difference.

TL;DR - Stop using 'I'm slow' and kill the negative self-talk. Be dedicated

1325631930.0,o1oxu,How the Physical Overcomes the Mental:  Lessons Learned from Running Everyday for a Year,runwell,514,69,81,"**1.	Mind over body**


A body at rest likes to stay at rest, requires a certain degree of mental will power, will power that I knew I would need exactly one year ago when I set out to run 365 consecutive days and to qualify for the Olympic Trials marathon.  What I didn’t know then, however, was that at some point the physical overcomes the mental, and rather than the mind willing the body to get out the door, the body wills the mind.  Here’s how it happened:


**2.	No Excuses**
I am a 39-year-old mother of two, incredibly supportive and well-intentioned, does not grocery shop, do laundry, or give baths.  His cooking, while excellent, is sporadic, a nanny


**3.	Planning – and Flexibility**
I ran into an acquaintance in the grocery store in May shortly after I had run a 2:52 marathon – a stepping-stone to breaking the Olympic Trials qualifying time of 2:46.  She was skeptical of how my schedule could allow for the training I had to do to run a sub 3-hour marathon. “It just requires planning, and book club, running gets put on the calendar.  My husband, also a runner, and I sit down every Sunday night and plan the week, including our runs, and we do everything we can do to stick to the plan.  If I have eight miles planned from 4:00 until 5:00 on Tuesday


Of course, and hold his head while he vomits, it’s tempting to throw in the towel, and believe me, I’ve been tempted many times.  That’s where the momentum of consecutive days running keeps me going.  Whether I’m on day 5 or day 255, it’s a shame to break the streak now, so even if I find myself in my neighbor’s basement treadmill at 10pm banging out 4 miles, I take it


**4.	No Ball Scratching**
Time is precious, I can make the whole transaction happen in less than 85 minutes, including changing, and showering afterwards.  When I run with friends, we don’t stand around for ten minutes tying our shoelaces and pretending to stretch:  we go out and run.  I often bring my running clothes to work and change there.  Because I carpool to work, on the days I don’t drive, I’ll get out of the car 15 minutes from home, which adds another 15 minutes to my day.  Instead of meeting friends for coffee, I thought of time in large chunks.  If I had papers to grade, I can grade two papers; if I’ve got 30 minutes


**5.	Embracing hard because hard is what makes it good**
Running everyday is part of what helped me PR in the marathon, but as Tom Hanks tells the women in A League of Their Own, “Of course it’s hard.  If it wasn’t hard, everyone would do it.  Hard is what makes it good.”  The best way to get through pain – of any kind – is to welcome it, embrace it, and most of all not to fear it.  Of course it doesn’t hurt to have a buddy to help get you through it.  I’m fortunate to live in a town with a large running community, so for most of my hard workouts, which is a huge help; suffering is easier when you’re not alone.  I’ve also had to do a number of workouts on my own


**6.	Except when it doesn’t**
I hate quitting a workout, hard just makes you injured or depleted, and it’s important to know how to read your body accurately.  This takes time and practice.  Shortly before my target marathon, I quit a 12 mile tempo at race pace half-way through.  At six miles, the struggle was too much, but quitting didn’t make me less tough; it probably allowed me to dig down and have something left at mile 24 in the marathon.  My body knew what I needed and I’m thankful that I listened.


**7.	Variety**
While I’ve thrived on the routine of running everyday, and exploring new places.  I like to run alone.  I like to run with people.  I like to run with an Ipod.  I like to run without one.  I like to run trails.  I like to run roads.  In short, I change it up, keep it interesting, and that keeps me interested.


**8.	Joy**
The runner’s high is no myth.  Most of the time (but not every time) I experience joy when I run.  Whether it’s the endorphins, the head-clearing, or something else entirely, I am at my best – my strongest and happiest – when I run.  And for that reason, I will keep doing it as long as I can.  


**9.	Letting go of the outcome**
About two weeks before my big race,” she told me.  “There’s nothing more you can do, so now you need to let it go.”  I did finally let it go, though it wasn’t until half-way through the race.  I was in the lead, had just run a ½ marathon personal record by 2 minutes and was on pace to run 2:41.  I knew I would finish the race, though I didn’t know if I would win (I didn’t) or qualify for the trials (I did), and that is when I was finally able to let go.  I thought of all the miles I had logged, how far I had tested my body, straight into a head wind.  That part was hard.  But hard is what makes it good.


**10.	Body over mind**
On December 31st, but by day 365, getting out the door is no longer requires will-power; getting out the door just happens, and before I knew it, I was at mile five on a familiar route.  At mile 11, I noticed that I was running kind of fast, so I glanced down at my Garmin and saw I had been running 6:30 pace for the last mile, I hit the next one at 6:01.  My body had taken over
In two weeks, Shalane Flanagan, and Kara Goucher.  Who am I to be standing there with them?  But while I’m not entirely sure that I can control the doubts and worries that will creep into my mind, I know it will not matter, because my body is trained and come January 14th, it will know what to do.

Think of it this way: you wouldn't switch to the left lane on the highway and drive 45 miles per hour would you? Well

If there are corrals and timing chips and people all around you with very determined looks in their eyes, and probably haven't eaten a piece of chocolate in weeks just to test themselves in this race. If your level of ability doesn't match the people around you, simply move back until it does. I promise you will get up to the start line in a jiffy, and you'll actually have a better race.

Look

TL;DR: Please line up in the appropriate corral or starting position at a race. It's very rude not to.

I was a chubby teenager who could hardly find comfort in his own skin, and at distances of no more than half a mile. I'd run to my high school, I have gone on to run three marathons.

Eventually I met a girl and fell in love. We dated for almost a year

My world collapsed. I screamed and cried. I didn't eat for 3 days straight. I couldn't listen to music or be left alone. I only felt numb through all of this. For the first week, only to find her ""embracing"" the single life happily, and with full force. I scoured the internet for breakup advice, finding no resolve, but a popular tip: exercise. So one day, I decided to do what I knew how to- even though I'd really put running on the back burner during my relationship.

I went out for a run. I turned my music up and ran through the tears- thank God they blended in well enough with my sweat so I didn't look pathetic. I will admit

But it began to get better. Slowly, yet 10 minutes alone in my room would send me into a dark state of depression. The solitude and peace of mind I desired was restored. It was as though I was meeting myself for the first time in almost a year.

I feel awakened. I signed up for a half marathon to give myself a moderate goal to train for, but with a level of heightened discipline to succeed. I even joined my town's running club, serving as a way to get involved &amp; volunteer, and spend time with people who share some of my passion.

Reread that title. I'm making it clear that I'm running through this breakup-- not away from it. I'm not only rediscovering the man I was before this relationship- I'm shaping myself into the man I've always wanted to be. And seriously, partner, or friends), the stress from high-piled school work, there is always a place to turn. A proverbial shoulder to cry on.

It's always there. It has always been there. And I'm so grateful I'm able to rekindle the relationship we had :).

I neither said nor did anything to provoke those assholes. Instead of saying anything to that fat fuck, I simply picked up the pace and lapped him twice, hitting 12 miles before leaving the park and heading home. 

I haven't be laughed at for running since I was overweight and even then

I have never mocked nor discouraged anyone for working out

One of the runners had to stop running, the marathon staff didn't react. Some runners ran by until finally one stopped to help keep him standing. Then another one stopped to help.

Now, the two runners who had stopped took the hurt guy by his arms and half carried him towards the finish. 

Those runners decided within seconds to abandon their strive for good running times and instead helping a hurt stranger pass the finish line at all. They did this after running 42km and without thinking much. I think that's an outstanding display of kindness and shows how intrinsically good those two people were in their hearts. I stand in awe!

Funny thing is every time I've seen that dude running covered in his shit I was thinking it's impossible for it to happen to myself.

I'm not racing, empty stomach in the morning. I was at around 20th minute when I felt very hard pain in my belly, it bend me over but I somehow kept going, it passed after 10 seconds. At around 25th minute of a run I felt great and sudden urge to take a shit. Thought I can finish at that time but few seconds later it was clear that ain't going to happen, I was maybe 5 minutes walk from my home. The immense power shit was forcing itself through my asshole was something I've never felt before and mind that I kept myself from shitting having diarrhea during 8hr shift, people told me I was green but I held it. I always thought it's impossible to shit myself but that was something different. I was walking and moaning from pain from clinching my asshole, Maybe 20 meters away from the doors of my home I felt that my ass is giving up and shit is coming out, was about to shit my pants and from what I was feeling that already happened, there were clear sings of that and.... went back into the colon. I got to the toilet

So, not my first time and such thing can happen. Scared me enough to not ever even try competing. If my shit was any looser I would look like that dude wearing pants made of his diarrhea.

Long story short

Let me also state that the bay I run around is a known running track

I couldn't believe they sent a police boat and a car to in estivate someone running around a running track! They appologised and ended up saying they were just doing their job, to then see a runner and then have the nerve to call police? It's beyond stupidity.

1326733783.0,ojgnh,Running the Olympic Trials Marathon:  A Day of Paradox,runwell,398,74,41,"**The Starting Line:  Humility and Pride**
I swelled with pride and humility as I stood on the starting line of the 2012 Olympic marathon trials, offer words of encouragement to the 191 women, ages 22-50, about to embark on the next 26.2 miles of a journey to discover what we are capable of as runners and as women.  I was proud of the work I had done to land myself a spot among such an elite group of marathoners, and incredibly humble thinking about what the top tier athletes standing at the front of the pack – who would be running close to a minute faster per mile than I was – had done to make themselves contenders in the strongest field of American women marathoners ever assembled.


**Mile 8:  Cooperation and Competition**
At mile eight, secure in the knowledge that we had no chance to qualify for London, but nevertheless pushing ourselves to do what we knew we were capable of and to enjoy the positive energy of the day.  At one point a spectator yelled out for us “break up the pack” and “compete,” to which one of our pack responded, “we love our pack.”  What the spectator didn’t understand – but what the athletes who will represent us in London do, as we found out when they discussed their race at the awards lunch – is that cooperation and competition can co-exist.  Sure, each one of us wanted to finish ahead of all the others


**Mile 18:  Suffering and Elation**
Just before mile 18, the lead motorcycle whizzed by us.  Meb Keflezighi had just taken a convincing lead over Ryan Hall. It was mile 26 for him (the men started 15 minutes ahead of us and ran the same looped course) and mile 18 for us, we cheered along with the crowds as Meb cruised by us and headed into his final 400 meters.  The crowds were wild and the energy propelled us forward, with the joy of being in that moment making the physical pain barely noticeable.  


**Mile 20:  Alone and Together**
By mile 20, each was alone in her pain.  At this point, we were each relying on the grit that got us to the starting line in the first place to get us to the finish.  I got passed by a few people in those final miles, and passed an equal number myself, and I felt a comforting solidarity, despite knowing that the only way to get to the finish line was through my own power.


**The Final Paradox:  There is no finish line**
While I had been on pace at 20 miles to run 2:44, my second fastest of the 10 marathons I’ve run in the last 15 years.  I’m looking forward to a nice long rest, celebrating my 40th birthday, and then competing once again.  The final paradox is that while I’m satisfied with my performance on Saturday and thrilled that I was part of such an amazing event, I know that I have a faster marathon in me.  40-year-old Sheri Piers ran 2:37:09 on Saturday, and 50-year-old Linda Somers Smith ran 2:37:36.  They are proof that age is not our enemy, and inspiration to continue this fantastic journey.

So the day before the marathon, we passed the Humane Society booth and I jokingly (okay, not that jokingly) told him he could get me a kitten for the finish line. The night before the big 26.2, I told him that I felt like I was preparing to go into the Hunger Games. He told me to think of it as a Quidditch match instead. I did not like his lackadaisical attitude towards what was probably going to be the most difficult thing I had ever done. 

The morning of the race, and I was feeling great. I was running with a friend who I had trained with for the last four months, and we were completely in sync. The first 18 miles flew by, including a few big hills. The crowd was out in full force in every neighborhood, and the spectators truly made it the most enjoyable race I had ever done. At mile 18 or so, the sun was directly on us and even little hills began to feel huge. We began to walk through the fluid stations and took a few minutes to catch our breath. The last 4 miles or so were downhill, and as soon as we hit the last mile, our last mile was by far our fastest. As my running partner and I crossed the finish line

(In the last book, Harry is left the Snitch in Dumbledore’s will and figures out that it “opens at the close” -pretty nerdy and uber cheesy, dont judge). He said it was the close of the marathon, and that I should open it. Inside the locket, the words “Will you marry me?” were written. At that point, I pretty much fell to the ground, and started violently sobbing and ugly crying. Good thing there were loads of cameras there to catch that! After I collected myself to the point where I could stand, we made our way to the finish line festival. Along the way

EDIT: thank you all! I wasnt sure how this would be received on r/running and I wasn't expecting this much love! here is a video my sister recorded of the proposal. warning: lots of tears. I'm sorry I don't know how to make it a pretty link. &lt;3

**Don't be this guy** This was a very small race that ended on a track in a public park.  As racers were seen closing in on the finish line, huh?""

My boyfriend was on the track when the guy said that and he told me about it some time later.  It made me feel sad, he didn't ruin *my* day, but I hope this kind of thing is never said in earshot of a beginner runner who loses drive because of one person's arrogance.

Edit: Thank you (to most of you) for the supportive comments. I really love this community. I would like to clarify a few things

1. When I say this was a very small race, I would have participated in this race. I would have happily participated, even if I had to walk. It's a very special cause and it happened to be a good run, also.

2. This guy didn't phase me, and I hope to get my 5k time down, of course, but not to prove anything to that guy. And when I get to a point where I have finished a race and gotten my bagel and I'm waiting on other folks, I'll cheer them on just as I've seen some of you do!

**1. You will be a different person inside, and you completed that goal. Let yourself enjoy that a bit, because regardless of whatever else you do in life, no one will ever be able to take that away from you. 

**2. Most other people won't care, your juggling of work and running, how your feet hurt, your pasta binges, everything. And you will find out very quickly that the only people who will really listen to you are (1) those who truly love you like family, and (2) other runners. Use them, especially other runners, and they may even turn the other way when you come into the coffee room.  But they are not why you're doing this -- you're doing it for you, and you will get instant validation that you're not crazy. Runners love talking about running. 

**3. It isn't a race.** Not the first time out, if you decide to do it again. I had a two-marathon strategy going into my first -- complete the first one, and then learn from it and improve my time on the second. I did that, by just under 10 minutes. I was delighted with both of my finishes. 

**4. The training changes you more than the marathon itself.** If crossing the finish line seems anti-climactic to you when you do it, 20 mile long runs, everything. The change in you already happened; you're just using the race itself to prove it. 

**5. Remind yourself occasionally of what you did.** It is true that any euphoria you get immediately after will disappear within a day or two, buy the finish line picture, and every once in a while you can take a look at those things and remind yourself how hard it seemed when you first decided to do it, and how good it felt to actually do it. How many times did you almost quit, and yet got up that next morning and kept at it, completely through self-motivation? You did good, so appreciate that.

1345259531.0,yeuf1,10 months ago my wife almost died from pulmonary embolisms... This is her finishing a 5K tonight.,neverwhere616,369,62,47,"End of September last year my wife ran a 5K in 29 minutes and some change.  She had been spending months training, a pulled muscle

By Thursday she could barely breath at all and the pain was unbearable.  She went to her doctor's office that day and the physician's assistant she saw dropped the ball significantly giving her a diagnosis of pleurisy.  The pain and her difficulty breathing were so intense by the next day that I rushed her to the ER and we discovered it wasn't pleurisy but actually blood clots in her lungs after a CT scan was performed.  

We were both pretty shocked since she was so active and had been making so much progress running.  Over the course of the weekend I watched her health continue to decline and I knew she was dying. I had to yell at the resident on her floor in order to get a specialist in to see her.  We discovered that her right lung was literally full of clots and her left not as bad

At the end of it, and lasting side effects due to lung damage.  She'll be on coumadin the rest of her life, her diaphragm has fused to her right lung due to the scar tissue that developed and a heavy workout that would leave a normal person feeling drained for a few hours can potentially wipe her out for a couple days.

Even with all that

I can't really express how proud I am of her for doing this after all the struggles she's been through.  I'm thankful every day that I just get to spend another day with her.  She's an amazing woman

TL;DR - Wife almost died because lungs filled with blood clots

1368778548.0,1ei9k9,So...this is it.,Kendallwithak,374,69,87,"Hello. 
I don't know what all I wanted to write here but just get some things off my chest. 

About me: I'm 24
I am one of those ""unless I'm being chased, work 10-12 hour shifts at a gas station with no lunches or breaks. My pattern has been wake up-work-sleep for as long as I can remember.  I enjoy working out... but in small doses but eventually slack off.  I'm pretty lazy when I wake up or get off work. 

So I met this guy (lets just call him Sam)  shows up in my life. I've only went one one date with him at this time.  Sam is this well traveled, I asked him if he wanted to go to the park with me and just walk the track. First lap is rather slow and steady. Nothing special just a simple pace and chit-chat. Second lap I said ""I wonder how long this track is?"" He turns on his Nike app and this time we speed walk it to find out its either exactly one mile or 1.1 (give or take for GPS). We did it in 17 ish min.  At this point I'm thinking ok let's gtfo and home... 

Sam says ""let's do one more but run the whole time. Everyone should be able to run a mile without stopping"" ... Now in my head I am like ""lol me run without stopping!? "" I explained to him that being a smoker and not active wouldn't work out in our favor. Pretty much giving myself an excuse to not do it

So the run starts! (Mind you this is terrain of inclines and turns.) At first everything was going better than expected

I told him ""I don't think I will make it  with you in front of me

Down to the final stretch of the run I slowed down to a speed walk and I felt like it would be the end for me doing this. I put my hands over my head and sort of run-ish/walk until he says ""you started strong will end strong

And we finish... I feel like laying dead on the floor because I didn't realise how out of shape I really was.  Sam brings me water and sprays it on my head laughing  as a way of saying congratulations for finishing.  So many things ran through my mind...

Did I embarrass myself?
Where Is my life going if I can't even run a mile?
Does he think less of me? 
I am sure I look like a loser....

Well panting on the side walk by the car Sam sits next to me and says ""I'm proud of you.""  I told him ""I'm sorry if I look weak because nothing says date me like sweaty,  he kissed me and said ""nope still think your awesome but now you have to run more so you get use to it and we can do this more"" 

The whole time I was giving excuses to stop and just give up but Sam made sure I saw it through and showed me that I am better than I give myself credit for. 10 min run for a mile made me stoked. 

Moral of the story is that even though I kept telling myself I couldn't do it

Tonight I went back to that park

I will start by relaying a classic story of mine: I used to manage a rock climbing gym at a university, my job was to promote the gym, get people learning, etc, and create a fun, friendly atmosphere. This is hard to do, because of people like Seydar.

What happens is that after a year or two, starts to complain about them. He bitches that they sweat on the holds. He bitches about them not taking turns properly. And so on. You would not *believe* how easily we forget where we came from. I've seen it over, and over, and over again.

And so to read Seydar's rant is to see this exact thing. He states that ""he'll continue to dispense advice"" to the idiots who get hurt... He makes himself feel better

But if you're a beginner

**1)** Everyone was a beginner. Even those D1 track stars started out as dorky kids in short shorts fumbling their way around a high school track. Their daddies bought them their first pair of spikes. Me? I remember emailing *everyone* I know when I ran my first 12 km! Holy shit! 12 km! We all start at the bottom. Most of us will forget it.

**2)** There is no club. There are no ""runners"" and ""non-runners"". There are no special privileges on here for ""runners"". There's no bumper sticker. You are a runner when you are out running

**3)** You are competing against only yourself. Unless you are olympic caliber

**4)** There are thousands of people out there who want to help you to learn as much as you can. They will help you with your goals, and what shoes they liked. They won't answer your questions and curse you anonymously. They will be glad you've decided to *share* running with them.

A couple years ago I started playing roller derby and it changed my attitude toward fitness. I finally found a sport I loved and that was fun enough to motivate me to get stronger, etc. A few months ago I started running to improve my speed and stamina on skates when I couldn't make it to practice. I was *so bad* at it it was unbelievable, but it proved to be a decent anxiety-reliever and the improvements came quickly and steadily which helped me stick with it. Well last night I had my first bout (game) post-running regimen and I ROCKED IT. 40 degrees Celsius plus humidity and I was a fucking warrior out there, my lungs and legs held out so much longer than they had in the past, and when teammates started dropping out of the game with injuries I had plenty of juice left over to pick up the slack. I sweated about a kilolitre but I felt so proud afterwards.

1372086849.0,1gz0bt,Tips for Running in the Heat,tm16scud,326,55,169,"Background: Ran the Franklin Half Marathon in TN this past Saturday.  Highs for the day were supposed to reach the low 90s

*Big* mistake.

Race start ended up being delayed for about a half hour due to a massive backup for parking.  The morning was nice and foggy, the course had very little shade - back country roads with few trees and no breeze.  At this point, I'm kicking myself for not bringing a hand bottle.

Long story short, missing my goal by 10 minutes and having a generally miserable run.  Had I followed my usual hot weather routine, I probably wouldn't have run as poorly.  So anyway, here are some tips for hot weather running (feel free to add):

1. Wear a hat or visor.  Sunglasses help as well if you don't care about goofy tan lines.

2. Light colored and loose fitting clothing.  Wearing a shirt will help better regulate body temperature than running without one.

2b. Cotton kills!  Tech shirts are a lifesaver when you start to sweat.

3. Sunscreen.  Especially if you pop your shirt off.  

4. Water.  Even with water stations at every mile, as is leaving a bottle in a hidden spot on your route.

4b. Take advantage of public water - outdoor fountains

5. Ice.  My personal favorite.  Tossing some ice cubes under your hat helps cool your head as well as lowers your body temp due to all the heat that is lost through your head.

6. Salt tablets.  Probably not necessary during a half unless you plan on being out there for 2+ hours

7. Run early or late.  

8. MOST IMPORTANTLY know the signs of [heatstroke](http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/heat-stroke/DS01025/DSECTION=symptoms).

Its finally summer and its hot.  Run smart.  Feel free to add your own tips.

I finally gave up and went to a sports medicine orthopedic doc a couple of weeks ago, shoes, etc, and give me a solid direction.  I was happy I went, but not too thrilled with the results.  

As background, and a few weeks off.

Swapped the Asics for Brooks Adrenalin GTS-12s.  Felt good, noticed the shin splints becoming more persistent.  Read lots about causes...too much too fast, poor foot strike, etc.  I even spent a couple months transitioning to a mid-foot strike to be sure that wasn't the case.  Forced myself to do it by getting a pair of Saucony Kinvara 3's.  Went through the expected calf soreness, and I believe I came out a much better runner for doing it.

No matter which shoe I used and for how long

He looked at my shins, I said ""yes"", and he said classic posterior shin splints.  Suggested Aleve twice a day, a break from running for a few weeks, stretching, and some additional theraband exercises to target those specific muscles.  I had already tried lots of stretching and time off.  Oddly he never mentioned pronation or the shoes.  So I asked.  He said ""That is possible"" and suggested the Kinvaras were a bad idea and to go back to Asics with good arch support.  Showed me what to look for with rear-to-mid sole rigidity and firm heel cup.

So...do I really invest in another pair of support shoes that aren't much different than the Brooks I already have?  Does anyone have any other suggestions before I blow another $100?  I don't have a lot of confidence that it will do a lot of good.  To make it worse

EDIT: Wow!  Just Wow!  You all rock!  I can't believe how much great advice and ideas you've given me.  Would love to thank each and everyone of you individually, though!

EDIT 2: Some additional background...

* I've used compression sleeves.  While running
* The pain is sometimes there WHEN I run, pain increases.
* I'm currently working on strength training.  Squats, and the theraband exercises the doctor gave me.  I had been doing all but the theraband stuff before, but not often.  I usually skipped lower body work because I didn't want to overdo it while I was running.  But I'm now hitting it every day for about 3 weeks to start building a base.
* I'm definitely not looking for a crutch (control shoes).  I worked hard through the transition to minimalist and better form in hopes that this would be the fix.  I'm now working on strength and stretching.  My preference is to fix my body

EDIT 3: Some of the suggestions paraphrased to the point that they're probably inaccurate or just plain dangerous:

* Gait analysis at a proper running store
* Go to several stores to be sure they aren’t upselling a particular brand
* Strengthen quads
* Squat heavy and deep
* Try custom orthotics
* Green SuperFeet
* Orange SuperFeet
* Strengthen Gluteus Medius
* See a good ATC or PT
* Trail running
* Run barefoot
* Don’t run barefoot
* Vary runs from day to day (concrete, sprints, hills)
* Read “Born to Run”

EDIT 4: Not sure if anyone is still reading this post.  I got some time this weekend to tape myself running.  I was surprised at what I saw.  If I see what I think I see, then front.

* [Old Asics GEL-1140](http://youtu.be/m0NI7FoPMaU) NOT 1170 like the caption says...
* [Brooks Adrenalin GTS 12](http://youtu.be/iHGNIN3g6Rk)
* [Saucony Kinvara 3](http://youtu.be/Hiw_Unsh30k)
* [Barefoot](http://youtu.be/BC3k8c3AFkY) just for fun

As I said...no shin pain with the Asics (lower weekly mileage) but the Brooks and Saucony both cause shin pain with nearly every run.

So I ran the London Marathon on Sunday, however I am still a big guy weighing about 220lbs at the moment. Anyway, I'd been looking forward to it for so long, and I was incredibly excited before the race.

It started well enough

I should say at this point that during my training I'd had a couple of injuries; Achilles tendinitis in my left just before Christmas and then 6 weeks later in my right. So that basically meant that by the time I got round to my final long run 3 weeks before I'd only managed 18 miles.

So that said, my quads started to hurt really quite a lot and my pace slipped to about 11:00s on average which I kind of expected and was ok with so I kept running.

What I wasn't prepared for was the constant sunshine

Then finally at 24 miles my legs just completely failed me, hamstrings, quads, you name it, they all decided they'd had enough. I came to a screeching halt and could barely walk.

Every so often I would fight through it and run a little but I'd only manage about a minute or so before they cramped up again and I would have to walk/limp for a bit.

I don't think I've ever been so angry, it was not a nice feeling.

I just about pulled it together for a ""sprint finish"" for the last few 100 yards. I finished in 04:47:26 and I was a complete physical and emotional wreck (which I had also expected) but this was not the ""Yes I did it!"" finish that I had been hoping for.

Has anyone else ever felt like this? Why am I not proud of myself? Why do I feel like I haven't achieved anything?

I had planned to get my first tattoo after the marathon to mark the occasion and to always remind myself of what I accomplished. Now I don't feel like I deserve it.

After I finished I said to myself that I would never do it again, because on Sunday, I feel like it beat me.

Anyway

P.S for anyone interested

This route is particular. It has clearly marked milestones

Tonight, the hell with it. I locked his pace and came closer. It was tensing. We made eye contact and instantly knew the chase was on. We began to taunt each other, pounding the pavement, our feet going back and forth in the flickering street lights.   

We pushed our legs to defeat. When we reached the end of the road he just looked at me as we both gasped for air and just said: ""mate

I was psyched. I still am. A couple of months ago I decided take my running training more seriously and it's been wonderful even after I have fallen ill a couple of times and have had to work my ass off to get back on track. 

I feel these are exactly the kind of things that make me love this sport. They push you forward and make you want to strive for more. To want to make you light a fire under your feet and go on for miles on end.

then the rain starts harder. it's pretty dusky dark at this point. the lightning comes in, and then GUITAR SOLO and I feel COMPLETELY INDESTRUCTIBLE. more lightning, more thunder, more rain. I can barely see because my glasses are dripping. so I push myself harder. Jim comes on and says it's time to run again. jokes on you Jimbo, I didn't stop the first time. 

so I ran the entire time, in pouring rain and thunder and lightning without stopping, and now I'm pretty sure I can do anything.

The problem with this advice is that it's just wrong. It's probably not harmful

I know a lot of people have strong opinions on this because they have been told their whole lives to believe that stretching is beneficial

**Does stretching prevent injury or help soreness?**

* [British Medical Journal: Effects of stretching before and after exercising on muscle soreness and risk of injury: systematic review](http://www.bmj.com/content/325/7362/468) - a systematic review of five studies concludes:
&gt; Stretching before or after exercising does not confer protection from muscle soreness. Stretching before exercising does not seem to confer a practically useful reduction in the risk of injury

* [Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine: Stretching before exercise does not reduce the risk of local muscle injury: a critical review of the clinical and basic science literature.](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/10593217/reload=0;jsessionid=BYr9LWEKFaul3crc7f8o.6) - a review of the literature concludes
&gt; The basic science literature supports the epidemiologic evidence that stretching before exercise does not reduce the risk of injury.

* [A randomized trial of preexercise stretching for prevention of lower-limb injury](http://andrewvs.blogs.com/files/stretching-to-prevent-injury.pdf) (pdf warning) - a study of stretching in the prevention of lower-limb injury concludes:
&gt; The results of this randomized

...there are many more

**Does stretching improve sports performance

* [Journal of strength and conditioning research: Effects of Static Stretching on Energy Cost and Running Endurance Performance](http://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Abstract/2010/09000/Effects_of_Static_Stretching_on_Energy_Cost_and.2.aspx) - experimental survey of the energy cost of running for stretching and non-stretching participants. From the abstract:
&gt; Our findings suggest that stretching before an endurance event may lower endurance performance and increase the energy cost of running.

* [Does Stretching Improve Performance?: A Systematic and Critical Review of the Literature](http://journals.lww.com/cjsportsmed/Abstract/2004/09000/Does_Stretching_Improve_Performance___A_Systematic.4.aspx) - a systematic review of both acute and regular stretching finds:
&gt; An acute bout of stretching does not improve force or jump height, and speed, although there is no evidence that it improves running economy.

* [Strength and conditioning journal: Stretching: Acute and Chronic? The Potential Consequences](http://journals.lww.com/nsca-scj/Abstract/2006/12000/Stretching__Acute_and_Chronic__The_Potential.10.aspx) - 
&gt; Although acute stretching, it may also reduce performance. Acute stretching can reduce peak force, rate of force production, and power output. Chronic stretching may enhance performance, although the mechanism is unclear. 

* [Journal of strength and conditioning research: Static Stretching Impairs Sprint Performance in Collegiate Track and Field Athletes](http://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Abstract/2008/01000/Static_Stretching_Impairs_Sprint_Performance_in.4.aspx) - 
&gt; The results of this study suggest that performing a [static stretching] protocol following a dynamic warm-up will inhibit sprint performance in collegiate athletes.

There are way more examples. Just do a simple literature search and you'll find that very few studies conclude that stretching is beneficial

Hey Runnit! So it's been a while since my last AMA, and give others a chance to ask some new questions. My name is David Torrence, and I am professional track athlete sponsored by Nike.

My PR's are:

800m - 1:45.14

1500m - 3:34.25

Mile - 3:52.01

3000m - 7:47.80

5000m - 13:16.53

8000m XC - 23:25

I am a 4x US National Champ, and just the 1500m in 2011. I was an All-American while at UC Berkeley (graduated in '08), and briefly held the school record in the mile. 

Although my accomplishments may be a bit more glamorous than the typical redditor, fun, or competitive goals I consider a brother/sister in arms. 

So ask away!

(Fellow recreational pilots will know that there's no better way to enjoy a day off than to go up into a blue sky... but I would advise against this if your legs are not in good-enough shape to reliably operate the rudder pedals!)

EDIT: I guess it's ""Shel"" with just one L. My bad.

 -------------------

I cannot go to work today

I did a marathon yesterday.

My legs feel like two solid logs

my feet are full of bumps and blobs.

 -

My butt is sore

I see food and my stomach churns.

My heart pounds in irregular beats

I've counted sixteen blisters on my feet.

 -

And there's one more - that's seventeen!

Why did I run 26 instead of 13?

My ankles hurt

My inner thighs burn whenever they meet.

 -

I limp and trip

Most 80-year-olds don't look this frail.

My hip hurts when I sit on a chair

My toes are numb and miss their hair.

 -

My back is stiff

My nipples hide under athletic tape.

My brain is tired

It's like I've had too much to drink.

 -

I have a hangnail

Wait. Here's a thought. Let's check the *[METAR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/METAR#Information_contained_in_a_METAR)*.

I check the weather every ten minutes. I push my morning run to the early afternoon hoping for the rain to stop. It doesn't stop. Idon'tgivenofuck. I lace up. He has errands. 

And the rain rain rain came down down down. 

I slide my phone into a ziploc bag and plug my earbuds in. I make a new playlist. I usually don't like surprises in my ears while I run but I'm crazy today. I could do anything. Yalldon'tknowme. 

He pulls over at the trail head. Asks me what the plan is. I say go do errands

I don't even say goodbye as I jump out of the car into the grey wall of rain. No looking back. I take a few steps thinking I'll just walk a few hundred meters before I start running. 

Nope. 

My feet hit black pavement and they fucking *go.* 

Its pouring. I'm running. No screaming kids. No dishes. No laundry. No paperwork. None of that. The trail is empty. The trees are a little melancholy but glad to see me. They hug the trail and divert the puddles. I don't care. I run through the puddles. 

My shoes are soaked. My tights are soaked. My ponytail is heavy down my back and I'm smiling. 

And the rain rain rain came down down down. 

I'm happier than I have ever been. I'm wild and free. I'm alone and in the world. It's just me and my mistress

I see five consecutive steep flights of stairs leading to another trail entrance. I make them my bitch

Then [this song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSt9lK_EPUY) comes on. I'm still alone. Still pouring. Nobody anywhere. Fuck it

I'm screaming and sprinting. *This race is worth the run.*

**You are almost certainly running too fast**

You get the most gains training on slow runs, you are sacrificing gains. Running slower will also keeps injuries down. And ""slow"" is likely slower than you think. Yes, you will need speedwork and tempo runs, but you are likely overestimating their contribution to becoming fast.

**Your injuries are likely less serious and less permanent than you think**

I lived through a good number of them. What felt like a stress-fracture was just tendonitis. What I thought was hip-bursitis was just strained groin and hip muscles. In the end

**Think less shoe=better**

Don’t fall for that whole over-pronation nonsense. Let your feet work like they want to, look good, steer clear. Barefooting, I hear, is awesome. I have tried it but have never given it a full-fledged shot. 

**Think 2 Years**

That’s how long it will take your body to get 80-90% of gains. It takes a while to build additional vasculature, muscle and tendon strength etc. Yes, it only takes a few weeks to get “5k ready”, but it takes longer to get the big gains. Lots of caveats - you have to train etc. 

**You will run races too fast and crash**

There isn’t another way to learn what you are capable of and how to adjust for weather, crash and burn. This stuff cannot be taught.

**You will run too slow and fail to make up time**

Corrollary to previous section. 

**If you commit to running a marathon

Running a marathon is more about commitment and planning than it is about innate ability

**Enjoy the running**

It's the single biggest factor of whether you will be a runner for life. Keep it fun. ",,t5_2qlit,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/jubo2/to_beginners_from_a_recently_graduated_beginner/

I just need to get some thoughts off my chest and vent a little. If you don't want to read my bitching
   
My mindset is pretty shitty right now. I was running the Munich Marathon today, I went through the half marathon checkpoint at 1:35:40, my legs felt fresh and the only incline on the course was already behind me. At mile 16 I started to notice stomach cramps and at mile 18 I had to stop and vomit. It was disgusting. I couldn't control the cramps and they started to get really painful. At mile 20 I had to vomit again and after the 3:30 group passed me I was pissed at myself and dropped out.  
From a health point of view it was probably the better choice
I drank sufficiently, it happened anyway. I also only used a brand of carb gels that I had tested in long runs before and those didn't cause me any problems before.
I'm not asking for sympathy
**EDIT**: Seems I caught gastric flu. I had to get up to puke several times during the night

Nope. It turns out the ""grid system"" for this city had an awful lot of curved streets and dead ends. I quickly started to feel lost, I asked someone what time it was and realized that I had almost no time to get back to my friend's house before he had to leave for his day. Finally, I stopped a runner with a smartphone and asked for directions. She must have sensed my desperation, because she said her car was just down the block and she offered me a ride. At that point, I had no phone, no phone numbers, and no time to get back myself, the same exact thing happened to her


So today, I spotted a bicyclist sitting on the curb trying to fix his bike. Cars were passing by without stopping, and it was a very low pedestrian-traffic area... I'd passed by maybe a half-dozen people in the 4 miles up to that point. He'd scraped up his arm pretty badly and seemed pretty downtrodden, so I told him I'd go home and be right back with some rubbing alcohol and bandages. I went home, picked up supplies, and my mother drove me back to where I'd found him. He had started slowly wheeling his bike down the road and seemed really surprised that I actually showed up again. I helped him clean up and bandaged his arm, and we had a battle over the $20 he tried to offer me before I dropped the bill at his feet and literally ran away yelling

Why? The sign to make the final turn was in the wrong spot. I lead the top 6 guys the wrong way into a dead end parking lot and had to squeeze between a fence and a building to make it to the finish line.

1367848053.0,1dsi7n,One Cycle (16 Weeks) of Jack Daniels' Blue Program: A Review of Sorts.,kenewbie,233,26,49,"Some background: I'm a 37 year old male from Norway (consider this my disclaimer on grammar).  I've been running very cusually for the last couple of years

.

I shopped around for some program to follow and settled on the Blue (Advanced) Program from the  2nd edition of ""Jack Daniels' Running Formula"". To measure my progress I decided on a full out 5k Time Trial before the start and after the completion of the program.

. 

The program is segmented into 4 parts

.

**November 2012 5k Time Trial : 24:46**

.

Desember 2012 : I spent this time ramping up my milage until I could do 40 miles/week without the  need for hospitalization. All of it easy paced running.

.

**Phase 1 (January - February)**

.

The schedule for weeks 1 - 4:

.

* Day 1 : 60 minutes Easy
* Day 2 : 10 minutes Easy + 8 x (400 meters Repetition + 400 meters Easy) + 10 minutes Easy.
* Day 3 : 60 minutes Easy (optional day
* Day 4 : 45 minutes Easy + 8 strides
* Day 5 : 15 minutes Easy + 4 x (1200 meters Interval + 4 minutes Easy) + 15 minutes Easy
* Day 6 : Rest for me ( optional repeat of day 4)
* Day 7 : 90 minutes Easy

.

I should take some time here to explain the terms used by Jack Daniels. 

.

* Easy is a pace you can hold for a long time
* Treshold is a pace which you can hold for about an hour in a race situation. It is ""comfortably hard"".
* Intervals are hard. They should be at the pace you can hold for a couple of miles.
* Repetition pace is fast but not hard (due to more rest between workbouts). It is somewhere in between Interval pace and Sprinting.
* Strides are shorter bursts of speed at about repetition pace with full recovery between.

.

The book goes into great detail about these paces and how to find your exact values based on something he calls a VDOT value. More about this in the random ramblings at the end.

.

I did my quality workouts (Day 2 &amp; 5) on a threadmill due to the whole living-in-norway situation. It is hard to keep a consistent pace when running on varying degrees of snow and ice and beneath a ton of clothes. My easy and long runs (day 7) was all done outside.

.

I had only done relativly easy running prior to this so my first interval session was rough. This got better quickly though

.

I ran most day 1 workouts in the morning before breakfast

.

Most of the easy runs I would go a little faster than the pace set by Daniels

.

All over I think this phase felt ok.

.

**Phase 2 (February - March)**

.

The schedule for weeks 5 - 8:

.

* Day 1 : 60 minutes Easy
* Day 2 : 15 minutes Easy + 4 x (2 x 200 meters Repetition w/ 200 meters Easy + 400 meters Repetition w/ 400 meters easy) + 15 minutes Easy
* Day 3 : 60 minutes Easy
* Day 4 : 45 minutes Easy + 8 strides
* Day 5 : 15 minutes Easy + 20 minutes Threshold + 4 strides + 15 minutes Easy
* Day 6 : Rest
* Day 7 : 90 minutes Easy

.

At the beginning of this phase I felt bloody brilliant. The threshold runs was not taxing at all and I decided it was time to increase my VDOT value (this in turn increases the designated pace for all the different workouts). After adjusting the VDOT things got a lot harder for a couple of weeks and then normalized again to what I felt was ""proper effort"".

.

I kept doing my morning runs on day 1 and every single one of them felt like shit. I started to do an additional morning run each week (most of the time day 4) in an feeble attempt to acclimatize to them but I had no such luck. At the end of this phase I decided that morning running is just not for me. Maybe I'll try again some other time. 

.

As with phase 1 I still did my quality runs on the threadmill. Some particularly nasty weather forced me to move one of the long runs to the threadmill as well.. I never realized how mindnumbingly boring 90 minutes of steady effort on a mill could be! I'll do my very best to avoid that scenario in the future.

.

Overall this phase felt great. I increased my vdot and was pretty sure progress was being made! I kept running my easy days a bit faster than presecribed by Dr Daniels. While I was sure this  affected my quality sessions negativly I just had a hard time jogging as slowly as suggested.

.

**Phase 3 (March - April)**

.

The schedule for weeks 9 - 12:

.

* Day 1 : 60 minutes Easy
* Day 2 : 15 minutes Easy + 6 strides + 6 x (400 meters Repetition w/ 400 meters Easy + 200 meters Repetition w/ 200 meters easy) + 15 minutes Easy
* Day 3 : 30 minutes Easy + 6 strides
* Day 4 : 45 minutes Easy + 8 strides
* Day 5 : 15 minutes Easy + 5 x (1000 meters Interval w/ 3 minutes Easy) + 15 minutes Easy
* Day 6 : Rest sweet rest
* Day 7 : 90 minutes Easy

.

At the start of this phase I felt pretty bad. I had plans to increase my VDOT during week 9 but I postponed it to week 11. I didnt feel particularly well when I did the increase so I made a promise to myself that I would stick to the pace on easy days (yeah right).

.

This was without doubt the hardest phase for me. My legs felt constantly sore and in the mornings when I woke up there would be actual pain assosiated with the first five minutes of walking (or trying to walk as it may be). My main problems were with the soles of my feet and the calves. 

.

Some nights I had trouble sleeping because the muscles in my feet kept ""twitching"". I could see random muscle contractions in my calves even when laying on my back resting. This was kind of weird and I felt pretty sure this was a sign that I had to do something :)

.

I had not done any stretching what-so-ever at this point and decided it might be time to start. I began a small routine which I did after each workout

.

I started running my quality sessions outdoor on a track during this phase. Even though I had the incline on the threadmill set to 1.5% to make it about the same effort as outside I was one hundred percent floored after the first few outdoor sessions. I've been mulling this over a bit and I think I know why; when you're on a threadmill the pace is set for you and all you have to worry about is running as relaxed as possible. Outside however your pace will vary quite a bit which in itself is not was efficient as a steady pace. In addition to that you have to keep track of splits and adjust your pace when you get too fast or fall behind. All these things take some of the focus away from running as smoothly and relaxed as you can.

.

I've gradually become better both at keeping an accurate pace based on my watch and at judging my pace ""manually"". As I get better and better at this I can keep more of a focus on my actual running.

.

Overall this was a hard phase. It is designed by Daniels to be the toughest of the phases and it was probably made worse than it had to be by me moving outdoors for the first time and failing to take adequate measures when I felt my body start to protest a bit.

.

**Phase 4 (March - May)**

.

The schedule for weeks 13 - 16:

.

* Day 1 : 60 minutes Easy
* Day 2 : 15 minutes Easy + 3 x ( 1000 meters Threshold w/ 1 minute rest) + 3 x (800 meters Interval w/ 2 minutes rest) + 15 minutes Easy
* Day 3 : 30 minutes Easy
* Day 4 : 45 minutes Easy + 6 strides
* Day 5 : 15 minutes Easy + 2 x (200 meters Repetition w/ 200 meters Easy) + 3 x (1000 meters Treshold w/ 1 minute rest) + 2 x (200 meters Repetition w/ 200 meters Easy) + 15 minutes Easy
* Day 6 : Rest
* Day 7 : 90 minutes Easy

.

The final phase and a more than welcome decline in overall effort from phase 3. My legs gradually started to feel lighter and at the end of many quality days I felt like I had more energy comming out of the workout than I had going in. True to self I kept running my easy sessions too fast.

.

This was the first time since the beginning of the program where there was actual rest in between workbouts (as opposed to easy running as recovery) which felt pretty strange at first but I came to love. I feel like an actual athlete when I stand around sipping my water on the track between intervals. 

.

I decided that my end of cycle time trial would replace the long run on the very last day of the program. The last week I modified slightly to give myself some rest; I replaced day 4 with 30 minutes easy as well as day 5 with 30 minutes easy + 6 strides. On day 6 I rested as usual and on day 7 I went all out for 5000 meters.

.

For my time trial I decided to use my current Interval pace (4:30 / km) as a starting point and then see how I felt as things progressed. I felt very good during the first 3 km

.

* 1 km : 4:27
* 2 km : 4:29
* 3 km : 4:28
* 4 km : 4:14
* 5 km : 4:05

.

*May 2013 5k Time Trial : 21:43*

.

A new PB with a margin of 3:03! Although I could probably have started out a bit faster and shaved a few seconds off, seeing as it is my second ever all out effort at the distance.

.

Im going to use this week to just run what I feel like as a reward for staying with a strict program for the last months. I'll probably head down to the track on my quality days and try to set some PBs for other distances

.

Overall I am really happy with the program as well as my progress. While I am still quite a bit off from my goal of a sub 20 5k

.

**Some thoughts on the book and and the program**

.

*Cadence*. Daniels talk a lot about how most elite runners take about 180 steps per minute regardless of speed, they never run as slow as I do on my easy runs. I therefor grant myself permission to run with a lower step frequency while running slow, as long as it increases along with my speed.

.

*vdot*. I simply love the vdot system

.

*Time, and designating durations rather than distances fixes this issue.

.

*Heart rate monitors*. The book lacks a bit of information on how to adapt its programs to running with a heart rate monitor. Since all efforts are based on paces you pretty much need a track or some long flat area to do your quality workouts. If the HR zone for the workout was listed in addition to the pace it would be easier to ""bring the workout with you"" when you happen to find yourself somewhere with a lot of hills or heat or wind or other things that make pace a bad metric. I think the info is in there but it is scattered all over the book and takes a lot of effort to extract.

.

*Tapering*. The book gives limited information on tapering. It is certainly mentioned but it is a bit vague on how to do it in practice. I would love if it included specific tapers with each program rather than say general things about it in a random chapter. The whole of phase 4 in the Blue Program is a taper of sorts

.

*Purpose*. The purpose of each workout is explained in great detail

.

*Would I recommend this book?* Yes. It has programs for pretty much anyone from a c25k graduate to someone just barely below the level where you would have your own coach. In fact many coaches at many levels around the world use adaptations of the programs and the principles in this book in their day to day coaching. While one might quibble about a detail here or there

.

So.. Thats it. I have had a blast with this and I hope someone else who is looking around for a program to follow might find this helpfull. 

.

---------------------------

- Who?: You're looking at him.
- What?: Kettle Moraine 100 Miler.
- When?: Saturday June 1st and Sunday June 2nd
- Where?: La Grange
- Why?: Apparently I thought 50 milers weren't terrible enough.

First things first…. I'm still trying to process all that happened this weekend. Without a doubt I'll end up leaving something out but I wanted to get everything I can remember down as soon as possible. Big thanks to all the volunteers and random strangers who made all of us runners feel like super heroes. Your words of encouragement mean the world to us out there on the course.

**INTRODUCTION:** This year i've run two 50 milers and a 50k which all were leading up to my first ever 100 miler. My ultimate buddy/crew man Kevin and I landed at the Milwaukee airport at 9:30 am on Friday morning. After carb loading on a morning beer at the airport we jumped into our rental car and headed west towards La Grange/Whitewater, perform surgery on my feet if necessary and pace 24 of the last 38 miles during the night while Kevin would pace 14 of the last 38 miles. 

**THE SETUP:** The way the course works is that there is a 31 mile out and back section (for a total of 62 miles) that ends at the start/finish for 100K and from there the 100 mile runners go 19 miles out and back (for a total of 38 miles) on another section of trail in the state park. This makes the race extremely difficult as 100 mile runners are allowed to drop out at the 100K mark and still earn a 100K prize.

**INTO THE DARKNESS:** The race kicked off at 6 AM on Saturday morning with both 100K and 100 mile runners taking off together. I was warned ahead of time to take it easy going out. 100 miles is a long time to run but what is deceptive about this course are the small rolling hills that litter all 100 miles. Apparently the locals call them ""silent killers"" and for good reason. These hills would come back to haunt all of us over and over again. 

So much happened in the span of 27 hours 26 minutes and 25 seconds (my finishing time) that I can't even pretend to go step by step through the race. I will however hit the highlights

The big surprise on this course is how varied the different sections of trail/forest were. We ran through open marshlands/fields that were unprotected from the sun, pine needle floor forests littered with trees as far as the eye could see, beautiful views on top of some of the larger climbs. Honestly it felt like I ran through 7 or 8 different trails all together which provide some great variety and kept my mind off the work at hand. The first 35 miles or so I ran with a gentleman who was turning 40 that day and tackling his first 100 miler (unfortunately I believe he dropped at the 100K mark). We did however set a nice pace (timing chip shows a 10:37 per mile pace at the 31 mile turnaround). Through the turnaround you head once again through a 8 mile or so stretch of open prairie/field/marshland with only a few unmanned water aid stations in between. A mix of not hydrating as well as I should due to the temperature being lower but the humidity still being high, not fueling correctly for the same reasons and just the despair of running through this stretch by myself was the perfect setup for my first and deepest darkest low point of the race. Coming out of the field section I immediately entered in the darkest and lowest spot ever in my life. I trudged slowly from mile 47 - 55 knowing that I was only about half way done and would be out on the course the rest of the evening, night and possible part of the morning. I thought about dropping at the 100K point (which I would imagine everyone does), I felt foolish for even being out there but I slowly started reeling everything back in knowing pain is only temporary and suffering is optional. By the 100K point I had my head back on straight, my crew had real dinner for me

Picking up a pacer as well as the afternoon sun setting made all the difference in the world. Kevin would pace me the first 14 miles out. He crewed me at my first ultra ever (Tussey MountainBack 50 Miler last October), on very technical single track trail. I'm proud to call this guy my friend and lucky I have such a great support system for these races. No one finishes these things alone: friends, family, other runners, aid station workers and random strangers send us positive vibes the entire way and without them I'm not sure if anyone would ever finish.

The night is a complete blur to me now: I do know I had hallucinations that included seeing turtles out in the middle of the trail, cooler weather and getting to see the sun come up. Hash browns and coffee at aid stations in the last 10 miles or so were also the best pick me up (race directors take note!). 

Some overuse inflammation starting around mile 62 really slowed me down the last part of the race but never stopped me in my tracks. Slowly and surely I pushed through finally crossing the finish line in 27:26:25 good enough for 69th place out of 113 finishers. 

**THINGS I LEARNED:** 100 miles is hard. really really hard. i am completely inspired by seeing seemingly normal people out there on the course grinding it out for no other reason than to battle their own personal demons and accomplish something everyone else told them was impossible. these are the kind of people you might see in starbucks ordering coffee

1365901407.0,1cauae,Here is correct running form.,ItsAFuckingCrocodile,251,44,73,"I've had a lot of questions on running form and I've noticed that next to no one knows proper running form And why would we? Afterall

 **A fast turnover will always beat a longer stride.** Remember that. It hurts at first and your calves will burn but don't break form. When you're exhausted is when it counts most. I'll take any questions.


**Head Tilt** How you hold your head is key to overall posture, and scan the horizon. This will straighten your neck and back, and bring them into alignment. Don't allow your chin to jut out.

**Shoulders** play an important role in keeping your upper body relaxed while you run, shake them out! Your shoulders also need to remain level and shouldn't dip from side to side with each stride.

**Arms** Even though running is primarily a lower-body activity, with your fingers lightly touching your palms. Imagine yourself trying to carry a potato chip in each hand without crushing it. Your arms should swing mostly forward and back, not across your body, between waist and lower-chest level. Your elbows should be bent at about a 90-degree angle. When you feel your fists clenching or your forearms tensing, drop your arms to your sides and shake them out for a few seconds to release the tension.

**Torso** The position of your torso while running is affected by the position of your head and shoulders. With your head up and looking ahead and your shoulders in the correct position

**Hips** Your hips are your center of gravity, your pelvis will tilt forward as well, which can put pressure on your lower back and throw the rest of your lower body out of alignment. 

**Legs/Stride** While sprinters need to lift their knees high to achieve maximum leg power, a quick leg turnover, and a short stride. During workouts though, exaggerating knee drive will greatly strengthen stride and endurance. Together, these will facilitate fluid forward movement instead of diverting (and wasting) energy. When running with the proper stride length, your feet should land directly underneath your body. As your foot strikes the ground, your knee should be slightly flexed so that it can bend naturally on impact. If your lower leg (below the knee) extends out in front of your body

**Ankles/Feet** To run well, try to spring off the ground. You should feel your calf muscles propelling you forward on each step. Your feet should not slap loudly as they hit the ground. Good running is springy and quiet.

Long story short I go in a motorcycle accident in September (got cut off at an intersection doing ~40 mph). Broke my Tibula, toe, collar bone. Got a metal plate put in along with ~60 stitches.

Had to relearn how to walk in November &amp; December and slowly started exercising again.

**Fast Forward to today:**

Because of summer classes and work I havent been able to run as much

I did a mile warmup  and then proceeded to do a timed mile. With how I was feeling I was expecting an 8:00+ mile. I surprised myself when I clocked it at 6:46.  Afterwards I did a quarter mile barefoot at a very slow pace.

It kind of fueled me to to start running more. I already signed up for a 5k race at the end of August. I would be extremely content if i manage to do a sub 20. I'm excited to get back out there again!

1367886720.0,1dtvjv,"Last weekend, instead of running a race, I photographed one. Now I know why race photos aren't great and are priced the way they are!!",ChiefBromden,242,68, so I decided I'd take advantage of this opportunity and endulge in my other hobby besides running. Photography.  
  
  
I'm an amatuer photographer and I haven't been doing it too long. I'm okay and do produce income on the side from photography


**Summary:**   

The race had a 6:30 AM start and had a 25mi or 50mi option. On trails. (a 25mi loop). I figured I'd get some pics of the start, I figured I'd hang out at the start/finish and maybe hike up a bit and take some photos a bit before the finish, on the trail. This way, I'd be able to get my 50miler friends coming in, then back out again. (after they finished the 25mi loop, they turned around and ran it backward) 

All in all I got some GREAT photos of my wife and friends. As practice, it very quickly dawned on me how people take for granted race photographers. Myself included!   
 
I'll never again complain how race photos are priced, and pricey work.    


**First**, mainly to cover the focal lengths. I needed the 18-200 to get shots from farther away and I needed the 24-70 to get good depth of field shots close-up. Ideally, I could have shot the entire race with just the D800 and a 70-200, but I don't own a 70-200 (yet). This just covers the camera and lens. It doesn't include my pack, straps, batteries, memory cards, equipment insurance
   
What's the point of listing all of that crap? Not sure, is pretty costly when it comes to equipment.       

  
**Second**, battling which way the sun is shining (of course, it's ALWAYS shining the wrong way!), etc. was very stressful! I imagine you get a better with experience, but it's not easy to find a good spot to shoot. In addition, you have to run from place to place where it's feasible. Get there an hour earlier to prepare, etc...

**Third, given my experience with the stress of finding the first spot. I was relieved that the first runner wouldn't be through for ~2.5hrs. Finding this spot was TOUGH. The course just didn't favor the sun at all. But, I finally found a spot. Then had to wait a bit for the first runner to come through. I took some shots of all the front runners, crouched down, etc. Runners came in 1 by 1 or in groups…for the next. 5. hours. Of COURSE you know after the first few guys came through, the sun changed, right? I finally spot my wife again and (ironically) hers were the worst shots of the day as she was bunched with a lot of runners. Did I mention I wasn't prepared with food/water? silly mistake.   

  
After my wife passed I went to head down to the finish line to congratualte her


  
**Lastly**, that only included about 60% of the runners!! Some, I had simply missed, or came in after my wife, etc…   
  
Then
   
  
and then


Now, photos of 'false runners' (runners without bibs who weren't in the race). Then, I took a deep breath and marked the ones of my wife to process. About 20 photos…~5 were what ""I"" consider keepers. Then, I edited them. Now, I really don't photoshop my photos. In fact, I didn't even touch photoshop. Just BASIC color/white balance correction in Lightroom, since I shoot RAW, I started going through my friends. All in all I spent at least another 8 hours processing my friends for a total of about 100 photos!!  At this point I gave up all hope on ever bothering with the other people. I'll keep them on my disk in case a friend of a friend ran and wants photos

  
Some takeaways and some rudementary and lowball number crunching:  

* You get one shot. The runner runs by, you're going to miss a shot. You're going to miss a focus. You're going to forget you weren't on continous focus, you're going to have to take a piss.   
* Unless you really spend the time planning, is going to be tough. At this point, you're sometimes 'just working with what you have' . 
* The equipment needed to do it right
* You have to invest a lot of time. Let's break it down. Driving to the race, The finish, The awards, the drive home. Remember, you have to shoot everyone right? When does that last person finish?! Let's use a half-marathon for example since that's a pretty common race distance. Let's say the last person finishes in what…3.5 hrs? So, say it takes 30 minutes to get there. That's .5+1+3.5+.5+.5 at MINIMUM. 6 hours.    
* Then, at MINIMUM. There is NO way unless you're completely just posting ""shit"" unprocessed photos, that would take 4-6 hours. We're at 12 hours of work. Then there is hosting fees, etc.   
*  How much is your time worth? Let's ballpark at $20 an hour. Let's just assume that this photographer (me) deserves $20hr (even though the expertise and effort it takes
* Let's calculate your equipment. Without getting into symantecs, like a lot) and calculate $15k/yr. This covers gear, insurance, gas, car maintance, memory cards, computer (yes, we know that's not true. Why? Well, etc. So

  
- Already, in selling your photos, JUST to make 20$ an hour for your ""time worked"". That doesn't include continous learning, research, networking, marketing costs, ughhhhhhh       

  
(that make sense? My head is starting to hurt doing the basic maths)   

 
- That doesn't include *SO* so many missed costs like web hosting


**Conclusion: TL:DR** 

- **The reason race photographers photos sometimes aren't ""super awesome"" is because it's hard to make 2000 ""super awesome"" photos without spending a lot of time. And

- **The reason race photographs are expensive

- Get a 'hard' foam roller and look on youtube for how to use it.
- Learn some runner's yoga.
- Have someone that knows sports medicine watch you run and do the exercises they instruct you to do.
- Strengthen your inner and outer thighs (squeeze ball
- Run by yourself at first
- As soon as you are ready
- Don't give up on yourself
- Bring a plastic bag to sit on if you've got to take a taxi home after pissing yourself.

**Training**

As of last fall I had been running for two years and done a number of 5ks and one half marathon.  For whatever reason I decided it was time to up my game and run a full marathon.  At that point I was running 15-20 miles a week.  I clocked in at 18:33 in the 5k and 1:30 in the HM.  After two months of not picking out a race

All told my marathon prep took 7 months (vs the usual 4).  Initially my goal was just to finish a marathon and not poop myself.  However
For the first 5 months I took my usual program:

* 1 fartlek:  4-7 miles at whatever sorts of paces appealed to me that day.  Usually pretty quick.
* 1 track workout: 2-3 miles Intervals.  200's in 0:34, 1000's 3:22. 180-197 bpm. Equal length cool-down jogs.
* 1 tempo at 6:00 - 6:30 pace. 180-185bpm.
* Sometimes drop intervals/temp and do 3-4 miles very close to 5k race pace.  I would try to do strides or play soccer those weeks. 185-190bpm.
* Tried to avoid all easy runs.  Sometimes my girlfriend (28min 5k’er) would want to run with me

And simply added a 90-120 minute long run every weekend. I did the long runs at a pretty zesty pace: 7:00-7:30/mile.  165-175bpm. All told this was about 25 miles a week.

The long runs pretty quickly gave dividends.  I dropped 3 minutes off my HM after 3 months and 50 seconds off my 5k after 4 months. 

After 5 months I finally picked my race.  I decided I was going to do the [North Olympic Discovery Marathon](http://www.nodm.com/) 2 months from then.  I also decided it would be feasible to do it in less than 3 hours.  To facilitate this newer

* Dropped the fartlek.
* Added Race pace short runs.  4-8 miles at race pace. 175-180 bpm.
* Lengthened Long runs 10-15 minutes.

Additionally

1 month out from the race (6 months into my program) I decided to do a half marathon to test the feasibility of my goal pace.  I decided if I could do a half in under 1:25

I didn’t make any more changes to my program until 1 week out.  Given my already low volume I didn’t feel the need to taper miles.  Instead

* Dropped my usual intervals/tempo runs
* Instead did 8 miles at race pace on track and two easy 4 milers.
* Was going to do some strides + moderate mile day before
Additionally

During the course of my training I averaged 29.5 miles per week.  Towards the end most weeks were in the 30-34 range

**The Great Race**

The day before the race I had a fair amount of trepidation.  My left knee hurt, 56 degrees, no rain, and a 5mph tailwind for most the race.  My knee and bowels also calmed down.

My goal was to average 6:50/mi for the race.  Since were some hills towards the end of the race I decided I’d bank some time earlier in the race so I could take them at an appropriate pace.   Accordingly

There were a couple people who started at wildly inappropriate paces and dropped off in the first 1-3 miles and by mile 4 race order mostly decided.  I was right behind some dude named Dave (henceforth my BFF Dave) who was also shooting for sub 3.   I stuck behind him and just took in the sights for the next 12 miles.  

[Here I am trying to look ridiculously photogenic at mile 4](http://i.imgur.com/NJB3P.jpg)

The race was well supported and had aid stations every 3 miles or so.  Most of the aid stations had cool themes.  The coolest one

In addition to the cool aid stations, and the finish.  My dad let me know how far back from the lead I was.  (In years past this was a smaller race and I figured I had a small chance of winning it.  The guy who won was cruising along at about 6:10 though, so I quickly gave up on aspirations of winning.)  It was really nice to have them cheering for me since there were very few spectators anywhere but the aid stations and finish line.

[Here I am enjoying a gel at mile 13](http://i.imgur.com/TL1uy.jpg)  (My BFF dave in the front.)  I ate gels at 7.5 (0:50)

I reached the half way mark in 1:27:47 (6:42/mi).  The first 18 didn't give me any trouble.  Each mile was between 6:35 and 6:56.  

At mile 19 I hit the hills I was worried about and my pace went to shit.  19 through 21 clocked in at 7:17, my BFF Dave left me in the dust.  I knew I had some extra time for this exact issue, but was starting to worry about making my goal.  I also began to understand why people say the half way mark of a marathon is at mile 20.

Fortunately at the end of mile 21 I was saved.  There was a moderate downhill with spectators blasting “Eye of the Tiger” I was able to get my foot speed back up and totally reset.  The next three miles I averaged 6:53 and was able to catch / pass my BFF Dave.  At this point I was blowing by the tail end of the half marathoners.  A lot of them were walking in groups and clogging up the fairly narrow trail.  At the time I was pretty annoyed that I had to yell at them to make way

I was feeling ok until right around mile 24.  My hamstrings and calves starting killing me.  I tried to inspire myself by noting I only had a 5k left and had 22 minutes to do it, but my pace just wouldn’t drop below 7:10.   I ended up averaging 7:15 for those two miles.  

It wasn’t until I was within sight of the finish that my legs finally relented and obeyed my demands to go faster.  About 1/3 mile out I was able to drop down to a 6:07 pace for a [finishing kick](http://i.imgur.com/bFvAe.jpg).  It felt good to look strong at the end even if I didn’t feel it.  After I stopped running

THEY RUN AND THEY RUN...
This is the season of the lonely sport.

It is called cross country.

The glory and the glamour are on the gridiron. The guts are out on the course where the cross country meets are run.

Football players perform in front of thousands of frenzied, rubber, and jersey can provide.

Their every hangnail is ministered to by a battery of trainers, and pour out reams of purple prose, quoting faithfully every belch and grunt, while radio and TV casters describe their every move in breathless decibels.

The football player gets the stats and the ink and the homecoming queen.

The cross country runner gets leg cramps

Most cross country meets are about as well attended as a refrigerator auction in Siberia

Cross country runners have no equipment problems. They put on shorts, you wear a headband to keep the sweat out of your eyes.

Football players hear the swelling crescendo of 70, the crunching rhythm of their own footsteps . . . and a little voice whispering taunts, asking maddening questions: ""Only three more miles, spaghetti legs, only three more miles . . . will you make it? Or are you gonna quit? Come on, lie to your legs some more; tell them just one more hill then you'll sit down and rest.""

They call it the loneliness of the long distance runner. It is an apt phrase. For the runner has only one other companion in each race . . . his name is pain.

They draw elaborate patterns of X's and O's in football, and they draw up game plans more complex and involved then the D-Day invasion of the beaches at Normandy.

But the strategy in cross country is simple and brutal. You go out and run and you run until you think you simply cannot take one more step, you run until all of this happens . . . and then you run some more.

Cross country runners perform in no plush stadium. Their course may be laid out over a golf course. Or through a park. Or over plowed fields. Up the hill, through the trees, around the briar patch, watch out for (ouch!) rocks.

They have no marching bands, startled but curious, watch in head-tilted puzzlement as this strange creature, which walks upright, goes galloping on in his underwear.

Those who coach the lonely sport will tell you a cross country runner needs: (a) endurance

And a cross country runner himself/herself may find it difficult to tell you why he runs

But one put it this way: ""Finishing first is a great feeling

""I guess it's because you get to know yourself . . . the hard way. You run and you get tired and you push yourself and you get a second wind and a third and then you're just going on guts, why it's like you're not part of your body anymore, it's like your up above watching yourself . . . it's almost like everything's stripped away clear down to your soul, and it's all there for you to see"".

""I guess I just like to look. So I keep running . . .""",,t5_2qlit,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1042t0/found_this_on_my_cross_country_website_pretty/

1344963357.0,y7l3f,The Ultimate Guide to Shin Splints,BigGunsLenet,234,46,41,"Shin splints are frustrating, over-pronation, and let's face it

For starters, bruised bone, compartment syndrome, or tibial tendonitis.  

If you've been suffering from shin splints for a while now

-------------------------------------------------------------------

There are several things out there that you can buy to make a tremendous difference when it comes to healing shin splints:

* **New shoes -** This should be a given.  Go to a running store and have someone fit you a pair of shoes (foot mapping, this way you'll have an idea of what shoe category you'll need.  While I'm not going to go into the whole minimalist vs traditional support debate, it is something I'd recommend looking into.

* **Compression socks -** I love these things.  I bought SKINS compression socks and I can't imagine running without them.  It may just be a placebo effect

* **""The Stick"" -** The toothbrush for muscles.  There are a few different versions you can buy.  An old high school track coach ended up giving me one of his, lay flat and have a family member, running partner, or your significant other torture the shit out of you with this thing.

* **Foam roller -** Another fabulous tool for deep tissue massage.  I like this better than the stick simply because I think it's easier to use and to me, like [this](http://www.amazon.com/Black-High-Density-Foam-Rollers/dp/B0040NJOA0/ref=sr_1_1?s=sporting-goods&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1344964138&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=foam+roller).

* **Calcium and Magnesium dietary supplements -** Calcium is essential for building strong bones and magnesium is involved in the function of your nerves and muscles.  Getting your daily value of the two is very important.  A bottle of these is pretty inexpensive.

* **Inserts -** Going with custom fit orthodic inserts is your best bet.  I'm not sure how I feel about inserts



**Now

* To warm up
* I then do [this exercise](http://gizmodo.com/5902699/banish-shin-splints-forever-with-one-magical-exercise).  Also, and write the alphabet with my toes.
* Next is the towel grab.  Lay a small to medium sized towel on the floor in front of you.  While seated
* After that
* Toe walks throughout my house.
* This is where I break out the massage stick and foam roller.  Give your calves a deep tissue massage.  If you don't own one of these
* Calf stretches.  I do [this one](http://www.racewalk.com/Stretching/TraditionalCalfStretch.jpg) and [this one](http://www.racewalk.com/Stretching/IntensiveCalfStretch.jpg).  3x on each side


**Heating::**
Use a heating pad or dip your legs in really hot water for 5-10 minutes and massage lightly before going on a run.  This will help relax the muscles and increase blood flow.

**Icing:**
You also need to be icing at least 2x a day.  Fill a solo cup with water and let it freeze completely.  Wear a glove and let the ice melt by rubbing it all over your legs.  This was easily the worst part for me.  I did about 10 minutes on each leg.  And instead of taking one of those dreadful ice baths after my runs

[**Interesting information about how you should kick the habit of icing.**](http://www.mobilitywod.com/2012/08/people-weve-got-to-stop-icing-we-were-wrong-sooo-wrong.html)  This was actually pointed out in the comments.  I was completely oblivious and had no idea.  Check it out yourself and take what you will from it. 

**Running Form:**
Watch this video: www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSIDRHUWlVo.  Chances are you probably don't have perfect running form and could make some adjustments.  The efficiency gained from adapting to an improved form will reduce injuries and make you faster than ever.  Fundamentals are everything.

**Change your surface!:**
I used to run exclusively on the treadmill.  My personal trainer would constantly tell me to stay off of the thing, ever since I stopped running on the treadmill and switched to concrete, my shin splints have gotten much better.  Coincidence?  Who knows.  Switch it up and see what happens.

**When you start running again:**
Please, dropping back down to just a few miles has been awful, but it really is necessary to start off this light if shin splints are a reoccurring problem for you.  And when you start running again, continue with these stretches and exercises!  Treat your legs like the shin splints never left.  Don't get lazy and let them come back, stop the problem before it starts!  This will ensure that they'll be gone for a long, long time.  Hopefully forever.

Well

**Edit1** - Formatting

**Edit2** - A lot of this stuff is subjective, including myself.  Some have claimed that inserts healed their problem over night, others just needed a pair of compression socks.  Personally, I think it comes down to footwear + running form.  Basically, think of this as a compilation of available options, not a list of essential tips and tricks that *must* be followed.

 25-30% of mileage but not to exceed 2.25-2.5 hours total running time. 

The long runs for different average weekly mileages:

*30 mpw— 10 miles 
   
*40 mpw— 10-12 miles

*50 mpw— 12-15 miles

*60 mpw— 15-18 miles

**What about the 20 milers?**
I can think of only two good reasons to run a 20 Miler

**Good reasons to run 20 Milers**

1. If you are running 70+ miles per week at faster than 7:30 per mile pace.  

In this instance

And 2. If you need the confidence and psychological boost of doing a 20 Miler

Many runners feel that they need the boost in confidence and the piece of mind that come from running a 20 Miler.  If you feel that you will get a big psychological benefit by running a 20 Miler

**Good reason to Not run a 20 Miler**

 It takes too long to recover from a 20 Miler


The stress of running more than 2.5 hours is too great for many positive returns and takes too much time to recover from.

The first thing to do:  Focus on maximizing the number of miles that you run over the course of the entire week.  This is MUCH more important than any one Run  If you are only running 25-35 mpw, make sure that you have maximized the mileage over the whole week— Work up to running 6-7 days per week. Add a mile or two to each of the daily runs- let the Long Run grow in proportion to the weekly mileage.

**How to get the Most from your Long Runs:**
If you are training for a marathon

**Long Run with Fast Finish** (Progression Run) Early in the program

A 10 Week Progression might look like this

*Week 1:		10 miles easy

*Week 2:		10 miles easy

*Week 3:		12 miles easy

*Week 4:		12 miles easy

*Week 5:		14 miles easy

*Week 6:		14 miles easy

*Week 7:		16 miles easy

*Week 8:		16 miles easy

*Week 9:		16 miles easy

*Week 10:	16 miles easy


**Long Steady State Runs** (Sub-Threshold Run)Steady state runs are done at Goal Marathon Pace and should not feel too difficult.  Do not make the mistake of running the Steady State Run too hard.  These workouts are sub-threshold; the runner never goes into oxygen debt.  Steady State Runs should be easy to recover from and not to hard on the body.

Warm-up 2-3 miles, for a total of 10-15+ miles

Week #			Steady State Run

*1				3-4 Miles at Marathon Pace

*2				5-6 Miles at Marathon Pace

*3				7-8 Miles at Marathon Pace

*4				7-8 Miles at Marathon Pace

*5				9-10 Miles at Marathon Pace

*6				9-10 Miles at Marathon Pace

*7				9-10 Miles at Marathon Pace

*8				9-10 Miles at Marathon Pace

4-6 weeks out from the marathon I like to have my runners run a couple of workouts of between 12 and 17 miles at Marathon Pace.  

The Steady State Long Run and the Long Run with Fast Finish are not an either or choice.  If you are just getting started,  etc.  

If you have a decent mileage base and can handle the training load, for example.

This long run strategy is not simply a theory of mine

*16 easy

*18 w last 4 miles at 6:00 pace

*18 easy

*16 with last 8 miles at Marathon Pace (6:06)

*18 miles 2 mile warm-up

*18 mile cut down (1st mile @7:30 pace

Edit:  I will never get the formatting correct.  My apologies to the 90% of the world who uses the metric system-  I am simply to lazy to do the conversions.

I started out running 1 block. I was 217 pounds. That was in January and I've now lost 33 pounds and just finished mt first half marathon. My time was 1 hour and 58mins and I've already signed up for my second one.
http://imgur.com/p9eWJj8

I'm a runner.

Edit: A little more back story. I first started running after I got myself the Nike+ GPS watch for Christmas and got an early start on my new years resolution. My girlfriend and I both decided to be more fit and wanted to lose weight (she doesn't run but goes to the gym more and does cardio there, spreading from my toes all the way up to my shins. I switched to a pair of shoes with arch support (I pronate) and my distance started to go up again. At around 7k, same problem happened with my feet and I had almost reserved myself to being a low distance runner. Around the end of January I started reading up on barefoot running. I currently work at a running store so I had encountered the topic a few times and since my distance wasn't very high it wasn't a big deal dropping down to 1k so my feet could adjust, so I decided to throw my hat in the ring. I bought a pair of the Vibram Seeya's and started running around a bark mulch trail at my house and switched to Garmin for my GPS needs (I started cycling a bit and the Nike doesn't work with biking, great for running though), upping it by 1k a week and then more as I become more comfortable. I finally took them out on the road once I hit 5k and everything was going good. The next week I went to do my first 8k run (longest ever) and when I hit the 7k mark.... nothing. Not one thing was wrong with my feet and I broke out laughing. I bought a second pair of Vibram Komodo's (which I did my half in). I did my first 5k race in March and finished it in 26:11 and was pretty happy about it. Ever since I could run longer distances without having to worry about my feet, I've been hooked. I have an unstoppable hunger to achieve and overcome more and more fitness goals. I have the Spartan Sprint this Saturday, the Whistler Tough Mudder at the end of the month and the Victoria Half in October

I honestly never really considered myself a runner nor did I ever think I would be a runner. It was always just cardio. I did rugby for a long time but running was always a punishment, and Ironman and an Ultramarathon eventually, all barefoot. Its a daunting task but 5 months ago I was running a block and now here I am, sharing my experience with all of you and loving every second of it so I know I can do it.

If anyone is wondering about motivation or how I motivated myself, the rain, the pain all whisper, ""you don't need to run today, its ok,"" but I'm too stubborn to listen. Every time I run I go to battle with the elements and the road, wind, not today and not tomorrow. That's how I keep myself motivated.

Here's a picture of me running my half in the pouring rain!

I decided then I would give the birthday run a go.  I have never been a fast runner but prefer the LSD runs.  My parameters were to complete the run in a 24 hour period

Birthday day arrived and I went out for a 6 mile run at midnight with my best friend.  After I was done I went home and slept until heading out again at 7am.  I started off with intervals of running 3/4 of the time and walking 1/4 of the time.  My girlfriend met me for lunch at 16 miles where I stopped and took about a 90 minute break.  I ate a huge freaking lunch.  It was awesome.i thought maybe I would barf later in the day but was okay.   I took my break time to charge my phone so I was all set.  I headed back the way I came for the  final 15 miles and was much much slower.  I probably walked the last 6 miles.  

At the end of the run was a  birthday party and celebration at my house.  The whole experience was incredible and I recommend it to anyone.  It's rare for me to have a whole day to think about things and not have to worry about the kids or work so it was a great opportunity.  I'm now thinking I might want to look into running a full marathon (ie. run the whole way.). I ended the day around 4:30pm.   Anyways

I never watched my diet, if I wanted ice cream, pizza, cheeseburgers, I would eat them. As I mentioned before, my time would have reflected a bit better.

A few notes about the race. Right after the 10K marker, at the 20 mile marker,  I wanted to die. Every step from 20 to 26.2 was agony. I jogged as often as I could bring myself to do it, but there was sadly at a lot of walking that was involved.

I recently decided to train for a half marathon as a way to motivate myself from my stagnant routine. When I decided this I also thought I'd try running without music to see what all the hype was about. Plus the idea of running for that length of time with music seemed like it would get annoying. 

I will never run with music again. I guess before I relied on the music to pump me up and get me through my run. With just my thoughts and my own motivation my runs are easier and more satisfying than ever before. I guess this also makes me much more open minded to other ideas I was previously unwilling to try. So if anyone else has any successful tips for training for a half I'd love to hear them.

If you depend on music...just give it a try without it and see how you feel.

I'm a 28 year-old guy with [cystic fibrosis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystic_fibrosis). CF is a genetic disease that affects multiple organ systems, this makes respiration more difficult and blood oxygenation less efficient.

It's like magic... I do cough a bunch when I run, but it doesn't bother because I always tell myself that I'm adding a few extra minutes to my life each time I hit the trails and crank out a few miles.

I'm sure that many of you have had plantar fasciitis, shin splints, and all the other stuff that comes along with this great sport. Those injuries can be frustrating, and I think we harp on what doesn't work a lot of the time. But it seems to me that most of the time our bodies work pretty well, allowing us to enjoy the road/trail whenever we want.

[The physiological benefits of running post](http://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/16yu4f/the_physiological_benefits_of_running/) is a sister post to this one that explains the benefits of doing certain types of runs.

**Races**

**Goal Race-** *Peak race*

 A Goal Race is the select targeted race that a runner focuses on for a training period. Because a runner can only “peak”  a limited number of times per year, 10k, 5k, mile, etc, you can run more of them because the take less time to recover from.  Serious runners who focus on races shorter than the marathon generally break their training up into a few seasons and build up to a goal race or two at the end of each season.  

Racing affords runners a concrete goal that they can work towards

e.g. Boston Marathon, or
Turkey Trot, PR!, 4th in age group

**Tune-up Race-**  *Sharpening Race*

During the training period other races can be scheduled. Runners generally do not taper much or alter their training schedule considerably for tune-up races, and provide an opportunity to check on fitness improvements. 

**Training Runs**

**Long Run-** *Distance Run, Over-distance*

Long Runs are often incorporate one or more of the other types of runs and/or intensities listed below as part of the long run; see examples below.

A long run is 20-30% of weekly mileage, beyond that you get well into the point of diminishing returns.  
	
e.g.  Long Easy Run
Long Progression Run
Long Fartlek Run, 1 minute easy running recovery, 4 miles easy


**Tempo Run-** *Threshold, cruise interval, tempo interval, long interval*

A tempo run is a sustained, run for a specified distance or time; usually 2-10 miles. The pace of tempos varies with the distance.  A short 20 minute tempo run will be much faster than a 12 mile tempo at marathon pace. The tempo run helps increase your lactic threshold allowing a runner to run fast, longer. I included long intervals as a tempo run because long intervals help increase lactate threshold. Even though they are not sustained efforts, the rest period is short, giving the same benefit to the lactate threshold.


e.g. 2 miles easy

**Progression Run-** *Fast finish

Progressive runs are continuous runs that start slow and finish fast. Runners begin with an easy pace for a set duration or distance and finish the run at a more intense pace at the end.  How the the runner transitions from the easy initial pace to the faster pace varies from incremental increases in speed over several miles

e.g. 6 miles at base pace + 2 miles hard
8 miles easy, to 10k pace at each mile
4 miles easy last 5 minutes moderate


**Fartlek-** *Surges*

Literal translation is speed play in Swedish (Edit: not Finnish as I put originally. Thanks for the correction)

Intermittent bursts of speed within a continuous run.  The length- measured in either time or distance- and the intensity of the fast portion can vary.  The duration and the intensity of the recovery portion of the fartlek vary as well.  

Fartleks are as a less intense aerobic capacity workout that spit the difference between an interval workout and a tempo.  Fartleks are often used early in the training cycle as an introduction to speed a  and ‘head’s up’ to prep the body for the more intense workouts.  They are also used later in the training cycle as aerobic capacity maintenance workouts.

e.g. 5 miles
2 miles easy
8 miles with 20 minutes of minute on minute off


**Training Run-** *Easy Run
 
  A Training Run is the default workout and pace

The training run is both a description of a type of run and a pace—See Intensities below. The training run is the most common run and the pace. It is done at the runner’s natural pace:  The pace that feels normal and comfortable to the runner
 
A runner should be able to talk in a normal conversational tone while running at his natural pace.  Training runs are of a moderate distance- not as short as an easy run and not as long as a long run.

e.g. 8 miles easy. Or

**Recovery Run-** *Shake-out, super easy run, warm-up, cool down, active rest*

Like Training Runs

Recovery runs allow runners to build endurance while not making any new demands on their bodies 

e.g. 4 mile shake-out.  Or

**Interval Runs-**  *Repetions, ladder, speed intervals, long intervals, sprint intervals, short intervals*

These are just a few of the many names and workouts that fall under the Interval Run category.  At the most basic level

*Name or type of Interval
(# of intervals)  (Length of interval- time or distance)  (Intensity of interval- duration or effort Length of recovery-time or distance)

*Recovery: The rest period

*Sets- if more than one
Length of recovery between sets- time or distance 
Type of recovery- Active: Run or walk specific time or distance

Interval workouts help optimize running economy

e.g. 2 mile warmup, 2 mile cool down. Or, 2 mile warmup, ladder 200m @35, 400m @ 77, 800m @ 2:40, 2x Mile @ 5:20



**Hill Repeats-** 

Repetitions run up a moderate to moderately steep hill- 4-8% grade. If the runner is bounding up the hill rather than running up

Hill Repeats are used most often early in the training cycle but can be very effective tool throughout the training cycle.

Hill repeats build strength

e.g. 2 mile warmup, 2 mile warmup, 2x Arb Hill (3:00), 6x Ridgeway Hill (45 sec), 2 mile cool down

**Drills-**   *Circuits, HIIT, strides, accelerations, hill sprints, sprints, bounding, 50s

Drills are any of several short and fast (&lt; 20 seconds) events that aid in developing form, or increasing running efficiency. Drills are usually not a workout in themselves, and are typically added to the end of a run or workout. Strides and pick-ups are also used directly before intense workouts like intervals or hill repeats (and before races) as a dynamic stretch and to increase the heart rate.

e.g. 10x 8-10 sec hill sprints at the end of training run. 

**Running Intensity-  A Note of Explanation**

*Running by Feel: Sprint, Training and Easy*

The five designations of intensity- Sprint, Base, and Easy- are broad descriptions of pace and not meant to be the definitive descriptions.  These descriptions are meant to be easily understood by runners of all ability levels and runners of varying levels of knowledge and sophistication regarding training.

An experienced runner has her ‘feel’ strongly calibrated to her pace:  she knows what 8:10 per mile feels like

Changes in terrain, or environmental conditions may encourage a runners to designate an intensity (or effort- e.g. Ran 8:20 effort on the snowy trails) instead of a specific pace as well.  If the runner runs on snowy roads, trails, at altitude, when it is extremely hot, cold, or windy, it can be easier to assign a perceived effort to a run than to try and run a specific pace. 

**Sprint-** *Top speed

A runner’s max effort for a short duration- no longer than 300-400m


**Hard Pace-** *Fast

Near a runner’s limit over a distance.  Hard is relative to the distance

**Moderate Pace-** *Intensity-controlled, comfortable, steady, specific pace (e.g. marathon pace, or 20 sec over 1/2 marathon pace)*

Outside a runner’s comfort zone; runner should feel stressed but in control—  feels like about 3/4 effort.  A fast and snappy pace that leaves the runner still feeling like she could do more at the end of the run:  she does not leave it all on the road

The moderate pace is not used too often in training relative to hard

**Easy Pace-** *Training pace, Natural pace, Base Pace, Fair pace, OK pace*

Pay attention here, call the base pace, Easy Pace.  You would think that the recovery pace would be called easy pace, but it is often not. This can lead to confusion, so be aware.

Easy pace is a runner’s natural pace:  The pace that feels normal and comfortable to the runner
 
A runner should be able to talk in a normal conversational tone while running at his natural pace.  


**Recovery Pace-** *Shake-out, Warm-up, Cool-down, Jog, Recovery, Super-easy pace*
 
Recovery pace is typically 45 seconds to 2 minutes per mile slower than Easy Pace. They are also the warm-up and cool-down pace before and after a workout and the pace used for rest between intervals. 

The recovery pace feels slow.  Sometimes a runner is so tired and flat that their only option is to run slowly.  Other times a runner feels ok

1357739551.0,168xr6,The story of my first running commute.,mueslimonster,173,28,37,"I would like to share with you the story of my first ever commute on foot. I live 9.5 km (about 6 miles) away from my workplace

It was not as easy as I expected but I'm glad I did it.

Some background: I have been running on and off since I was 14, my current longest run being a recent 13.5 km, or 15k if you include warming-up and cooling-down. So I figured 2x9.5 km on a day can't be so hard, can it? Last Monday I prepared by bringing clean clothes to my workplace, and yesterday morning I took off, on foot, carrying in a backpack some breakfast and clean underwear.

Lesson 1: I need to get a better backpack if I want to do this more regularly. The backpack was bouncing about very uncomfortably and I decided to take a couple of recovery breaks during the run. But in the end I arrived

Then

Lesson 2: it's hard to run twice on a day. My muscles were clearly not expecting this to happen.

As I did some warming-up, two rowing boats took off. I was running slightly faster than those boats; of course I couldn't slow down now! Stride after stride, I slowly overtook the boats, my face not showing anything of the growing surge of pain in my muscles. I was looking good!

Soon, I started running again and... ouch! The strangest sensation happened. My energy level was fine, and my body was totally ready to go! But my legs were just burning at every stride. My calves felt overstretched and even my joints started complaining a bit. Grudgingly, I started... walking.

After a minute of walking I started to jog very slowly again. Interestingly enough I could do it, but this pace felt slow! Maybe it was 6:00/km, maybe it was 7:00/km - I really don't know. But strangely enough, it felt good! In fact, it felt really good!

I kept running like this until I reached home, no speed at all, not even a high heart rate, but endorfin levels like crazy. Is this how ultramarathoners feel? Did I approach that sensation? I don't know, but if so, I need to run an ultramarathon one day!

Such were my thoughts at that point.

Fortunately, hung around a bit and went to bed early.

This morning my legs felt tired and my left calve feels a bit hurt

Last year I made a bet with my boss that I could beat him in a local 50k. He is a long time ultra runner with experience beyond my years, I'd be sipping champagne waiting for him to finish.


The day of the race comes and I have basically trained for it like I train for most of my marathons with relatively little or no foresight that the extra distance could be my undoing. The race is 6 laps through a rolling set of horse trails that quickly become almost knee high mud in areas, 32 minutes, 35 minutes, 43 minutes, Fin.


This marks my first real DNF, or even marathoners. However I had not yet encountered them and needed to find a method for solving this problem lest the race win the following year. 


Skip ahead 6 months, but necessary alterations to my training plan to properly solve the previous issues I have had. In May I had nearly DNF'd out of a marathon having found myself blown up again and passed out on the side of the road for several minutes, a few times. My fueling had been better this time around, but I seemed to have found a current limit to the distance I could maintain a relatively moderate pace at. As I prepared my training for Jan 2012 I had several issues to solve:


1. fueling
2. cramping from the marathon in May
3. maintaining a consistent effort over the course


Starting in June I began taking weekly trips out to the North Cascades to begin getting used to spending a long time on my legs. The runs started out as 2-3 hours, I would jog easily on the flats, and try to be a smooth and efficient on the descents. I would bring twice the amount of food I figured I would need, all of varied types. Gels, blocks, solid food, sandwiches, I didn't bring it on the next trip, my main focus as I ran these, and if I could keep myself moving for 4 hours going up and down mountain passes for 5 hours


Following the injection of super long runs into my training I started to build my mileage up. In the fall I was running XC, and needed to find a way to simulate that sort of over hill over dale raw XC strength in other manners. What I ended up with was alternating days of 90 minutes of relaxed running on rolling trails, with days of 90 minutes with a sustained effort on rolling trails. Essentially a 90 minute run with 30 minutes of uptempo injected midway. The courses I ran always had hills, but no extended climbs as that was not my focus. My philosophy was: the more time spent on the surface the faster you get at it. My race I was gearing up for was on rolling muddy trails that had some fast sections, and some slower ones as well so those were the types of trails I ran on for months.


XC came and passed and I was left with 2 months to prepare until the race. Despite my unorthodox training, the idea that knowingly increasing my sodium intake may (albeit by placebo) stave off cramping was enough to leave me hopeful.


On race day I had the same plan as the previous year, then followed that up with another evenly paced lap 35:05, and 34:33. At this point I knew I was racing into unknown territory. My lead was massive, and the only person who could keep me from finishing very well was myself. Towards the end of lap 4 my stomach started to rebel as fiercely as my lower intestine had previously. The gels weren't staying down so I swapped to flat coke for lap 5 and continued eating despite the vomit. I hadn't passed all the caffeine from my system yet so again on lap 5 I took a trip to the brush and eased off the gas ever so slightly, 37:52. Lap 6 I went back to water and swore off the gels. I knew I had enough sugar in my body to make the final loop, so I just worried about hydration. On several uphills I began to feel my hamstrings tighten, easing off the gas on them until I got back onto a flats where I ever so slightly lowered my pace back down. Sometimes the flat section wasn't long enough to get back to my comfortable ""top speed"", finish time 3:33.


The biggest lesson learned here is: don't train abstractly. If you're training for a race on roads, try your best to simulate the trails you will be running. Running a trail is one thing, racing it when its muddy is another.


Work on what you have issues with. In the following years I will have to work on speed work if I wish to get much more of my PRs down any farther. Not to say I will need to DO more speed work

1350267638.0,11hpj4,Finished my first 50 miler this morning. Here is a small race report for any of you that are curious.,,163,23,59,"So I ran the Heartland 50 miler in Cassoday

Cost: I signed up in June and I don't remember how much I paid. I know it was $55 or under

Pre-race instructions: Since Cassoday is super small town in the middle of nowhere, and they were on it with updates for us.

Aid Stations: There was an aid station roughly every 4 miles. At 4, they were unmanned with a good selection of food and water to fill up with. At 8, 16, and the 25 mile turnaround, they were manned. I have never seen such dedicated volunteers in my life. Through all the crap weather, they stuck it out and motivated us. The food they were making for us was awesome. I even had one volunteer at mile 33 help me take my shoes off to get the rocks out of them. Simply amazing. 

Course: The course was well planned out and well marked. The whole race is through a prairie

The 100 milers started at 0600 on Saturday

My overall experience was amazing. Some advice to anyone wanting to run a 50 miler: hydrate more than you think you need to. My right calf cramped really bad from mile 12 to mile 22 and I could tell it was from dehydration. Eat. Eat Eat Eat. I was starving and could feel myself being malnourished by the turnaround. Lastly, I'm going to force myself to run unless it's an uphill.

1372538772.0,1hbu2c,So my wife doesn't want me to run my first 50k in September and why I'm going to do it. (kinda long story),medic914,187,45,38,"(Backstory)  I'm 35 years old and have been happily married to my wife for 10 years this October.  We have 3 children and life is pretty much good for us.  I joined the Army in 1996 just out high school and was active until 2001

Fast forward to 2009.  My wife had just gotten a job as a fitness instructor at  local gym, 50 pounds overweight and close to a habitual drinking problem.  

I started wheezing on the treadmill and lifting some weights but I liked how I felt after running more than anything else.  I kept a modest workout schedule, 10ks and halfs and completed my first marathon this last April 7th.  A complete lifehack.  And I was happy.

About 8pm the night before my first marathon, diabetic, and in poor health Im thinking the worst.  I stay with him in the hospital until about midnight.  He in stable condition and being admitted and is apologizing to me about being there, that ""he's sorry that he's there, that he knows how hard Ive worked and he wanted to be there at the finish line for me.""  Gawd, it was sad.

So I get back home around 1am.  I know the race is about 30 min away so I must leave by 7:45 to park and make the 830am start.  At 2am I'm laying wide awake in my bed, 4 hours?

Race day.  My wife and I get to the starting line and surprisingly I don't feel too bad.  It was an out and back course and she wanted to help me so the plan was for her to run the first 6 miles with me

When she saw me after running 20 miles she was probably concerned for my health.  I had slowed way down around mile 18.  I was hitting the wall and I knew it.  My legs didn't feel too bad just the engine inside me was drained of fuel.  But being determined and stubborn there was no way in hell I wasn't going to finish.  She picked me up and we shuffled along until I finished.  We finished together.  My wife is awesome and beautiful and Im not sure if I could have done it without her.  It was tough.  I finished in 4:47:00.

I felt good in the following days and picked up some slow miles the next week.  I started slowly building a base again.  I knew the time of that marathon wasn't great but I wanted to run farther.  I told my wife about a 50k trailrun that just so happened to be taking place on the trail system that is 5 mins from my house and I run them weekly.  She told me that I was crazy..."" you barely finished that marathon and you want to run 5 miles farther on trails with more hills?!!!""

I knew that my stress the night before the race and lack of sleep probably affected the slow time of my marathon more than anything else.  Training went well other than a little Achilles issue near my taper but I learned a lot about myself from that run.. A lot about being determined to finish and even though I was physically drained at the end of that marathon I knew I had the drive to finish. I believe I can complete any distance if I train for it.

I started secretly looking up 50k training plans on the interwebs.  Yes

 I signed up for it and had the confirmation sent to her email address.  She's a good sport.  She'll get over it. 

**EDIT** My dad is doing good.  He had a heart stent and has changed his diet and started walking the dog everyday.  He's lost some weight and promises me that he'll be at the finishline of the 50k.  I know I'll be there too.

~~~~~

Well

I started off excellent. I was able to get to the very front of wave 2 (which started 30 minutes after wave 1), I was able to run basically a new race.

I'd like to protect my identity
I came in with a goal of getting under 2:50, and even running a bit faster than that (averaged around 6:09 pace, hit the half at 1:20). But then, mile 17 came... and it got all uphill from there. I ran a 6:43 mile 17, and mile 18 was a 7:28, and from then on, it was consistent 8:40s until the end

I don't know, thousand-pound legs, feeling your calves straining, feet hurting... wow. I was blown away by how painful all of that was. And I let my ego get in the way of that.

I was still able to qualify for Boston

But honestly, but that feeling of hitting the last corner and crossing that finish line is simply incredible. I highly recommend it to those on the fence about it.

**Training**

I qualified for Boston 2013 at Santa Rosa marathon in August 2012.  This left me with ~7.5 months to recover

Recovery from Santa Rosa included essentially nothing.  I ran once a week for 2 weeks and then 2-3 times a week for another 2 weeks.  No watch

After recovery, 30, 40, 50 and then held 50 until Christmas time.  I tracked my distance, but didn't really track pacing except for weekly tempo runs with a group I run with.  Again, lack of structure was pretty nice that far out from a race.  I hurt my back a little bit playing golf before xmas, and then skiing a bunch on it in the ensuing snow storms (powder!! Worth it!)

The 16 week buildup (now 15), so jumping into the plan 3 weeks after it was designed to start was not a problem.  I say 'loosely followed' because I re-structured to plan to conform to weekly tempo runs with a run group and Saturday long runs.  Everything else fell out of that.

As usual

1. Miles.  I wanted to hit 70 mpw and feel good about it (I think most 50 mpw runners could run a shitty 70 mile week and feel pretty wrecked by the end).  This meant diligent ramp up with multiple weeks in the mid 60s and high 60s through February and early March.

2. Hills.  Boston is known for crushing runners in miles 16-20 through the Newton Hills and Heartbreak Hill.  I wanted to feel pretty strong at the end of these hills because I knew a strong finish would be necessary to make up for the pace drop on the ascent.  To add hill strength, and I added some pure hill workouts with lots of 2-4 minutes hill climb efforts.

Additionally

A typical week would look like this:

* M: Tempo
* T: Recovery 5-6
* W: Moderate 8-12
* Th: Recovery 5-6
* Fr: Moderate 8-12
* Sat: Long 17-24
* Sun: Moderate 5-10

**Taper**

Taper plan was pretty simple: 40, so it ended up being like 38, 28, 15.  Most of the runs consisted of 1 mile warm up, marathon pace running, 1 mile warm down.  Taper started 21 days out, and I had big tempo workouts 19 and 11 days out before I stopped anything faster than marathon pace.  4 days out I did nothing but easy runs to stay loose, but opportunely placed for a decent amount of pain in-race).

**Race**

I got dropped off by my Aunt's family at the State Park in Hopkinton at about 7:45 am on race day to take the shuttle to the starting area.  Much preferable to taking the bus

I sat around for a while, so I only had to spend about 15 minutes in the corral, which was nice.

When the gun for the pro-men went off

The first 3 miles of the race were pretty uneventful.  I was worried that I was caught in the crowd and going too slowly (started at over 7 minute pace)

I ended up finding a dude that I raced with at LA Marathon last year and said what's up.  We cruised together for a while

The rest of the first half was actually pretty uneventful as well.  I was worrying a little about my legs because they felt so heavy, so I was OK with it.  Running through Wellesley was pretty insane, I could barely hear because of all the yelling from the girls, but it was the first of many sections that were amazing from all the crowd support.

Miles 13-15 were a little rough and I'm not sure why.  Perhaps my nutrition was a little lacking through there

Mile 16 is where the Newton Hills start.  I had some family at the Washington Street overpass who handed me some liquid calories (Gu Rocktane Endurance Drink) which I drank over the next 4 miles.  The hills themselves were not too bad.  I slowed my pace for fear of blowing up (hill chops were as-yet untested), 7:05, 7:19, 7:29 through the hills and up Heartbreak Hill.

At the top of Heartbreak Hill, but also relieving, because I knew I could still hold out for sub 3:05 (re-qualifying time).  The other thing that felt great was that my legs felt decently strong and I was able to hold 6:49 averages from there until the mile 25 marker.

EDIT: Clarity.  Thanks Seydar!

At mile 25, so I hammered it out averaging about 7:15/mile for the remainder, crossing at 3:03:47.

**Nutrition**

I tried something new this time around:  2 shot bloks 30 mins before the start, followed by liquid calories at mile 16-20.  I drank water at every water stop and it certainly helped me avoid stomach cramps from the shot bloks.  I also took a SaltStick Tab at mile 5, 10 and 15.

EDIT: I ran with one of [these](http://www.flipbelt.com/the-flipbelt/) and I highly recommend it.  Sat comfortably under my singlet and held the salt tabs and 4 sleeves of shot bloks comfortably and tightly

**Afterwards**

My overall impression of the race was incredible.  The crowd support was insane.  Better than any race I've ever done, a pre-race dinner, and a post-race party (cancelled), all included in the race fee).  The chance to run on such a storied course was also an amazing experience, and I felt lucky every step of the way.

The comraderie at the finish line was completely unexpected.  At a race where there are more than a handful of serious runners finishing at 3:00-ish

I ended up being nowhere near the bombings, so I'll limit my comments to running related topics.  My post race was completely thrown off by the events that occurred.  Normally I process my race over and over again to figure out what to work on for next race, but I'm just now beginning to think about what to work on over the summer.  I hope the other runners who did not get the stellar race experience that I got will get another chance to run the Boston Marathon and receive an official time/finishing experience.",,False,,t5_2qlit,,http://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1cy9o6/race_report_boston_marathon/

Edit: Just did my first sprint workout. Sprint/jog intervals over the course of  3 miles. Wow- by the end it became drag ass/ drag ass with slightly better form.

I would probably do it, every 5km and also some in between. I poured lots of water on my hat, head since it was really really hot and sunny.

1276720980.0,cfr68,How To Run Faster and Longer,BlueThen,148,16,54,"Well

I had the mile run coming up last school year. I really wanted to cut off some time, and healthy eating, I managed to cut off 2 1/2 minutes (from 8:45 to 6:15) in only 2 months for my mile run. I'm not an overweight guy. I'm actually well underweight. The main problem I had was that 95% of the info I could find online was about ""weight loss"", something I'm not concerned with... So, out of all the other information, this is what I've gathered in that time-span:


One of the main things that you should focus on is your form:

* Don't step farther out in front of underneath your body when you run. When you do, and letting yourself just ""fall"" into your next step. 

* Try to step in front or near in front of the other foot. Wide steps while running can put out force to the side

* Keep your back straight

* I've heard that you shouldn't bounce at all when running

* The leg forms a natural spring to avoid shock when you land mid-to-forefoot. Try not to land on your heels when running.

* Deep breaths! Avoid shallow breathing at all costs. You may get side stitches and you'll **really** want to take short breaths, you'll eventually do it naturally and not even have to think about it to do it. Try to use all of your lungs.

* If you're running for distance, whether a certain distance is long or short is up to you. It really depends on the pace you want to take and how much energy you're willing to spend.

* When running



Diet also plays an important role in how you run:

* Eat plenty of complex carbs. Things like bread, and other foods are good sources. The night before any big run, you'll want to load up on these.

* Protein can't hurt either. Abundant in meats and dairy products

* Avoid simple carbs, especially when big races are coming up.

* Drink lots of water. Some herbal teas and juices can also hydrate. Milk, and coffee are weak hydrators, so you shouldn't rely on them for hydration.



Practice!

* Get a running partner. It really helps motivate you to put in more effort.

* Try waking up early and run before school/work. You may not feel like it when you wake up

* Run long distances and short distances. Try to mix it up

* Hills may seem like your worst enemy

* Warm up your muscles before running by doing a steady jog. This can help prevent injuries and get your blood pumping for harder workouts. Stretch after runs

* In cold weather, warm socks. Your body will redirect the heat from your extremities (toes, fingers, penis), to your necessities (heart, lungs), so try to keep them warm.

* Try not to eat immediately before running. You can get sick

* Get some carbs and protein in soon after running. The period of about 45 minutes immediately after running will be your most beneficial time for absorbing nutrients.

* Be careful and watch your step!

* You can build distance by increasing your weekly base mileage.

* You can build speed by interval training. Run fast for a period of time



Some last things:

* Record your distances and times in a log or journal. Try to focus on getting faster and longer times! 

* Get some rest every once in awhile (two or three days a week will be fine). You don't have to not run on your rest days

* Your shins might get sore if you're starting out (shin splints). Getting new insoles for my shoes helped a lot for me. Give more time for your shins to recover

* If you start feeling dizzy or light-headed

* Don't run in brand new shoes on important race days. You'll want to jog a lot in them before hand so you can adjust to them and they can adjust to you.

* Challenge yourself! You can't get a better mile time until you *try* to get a better mile time!



**Don't be afraid to look up info about running on the internet!** Just try to check several sources on each topic, so do some research!

Good luck out there!

1) When beginning to run (zero fitness) always go slow and continue running slow for 2-3 months. Be very careful about mixing in a fast run cause it could set you up for a nagging injury that may not heal. Build a solid base first. Be patient and speed will follow.

2) Stretch IT band or whatever your weakness regularly.

3) Don't assume footwear is good (old or new)- One of my Achilles tendons started acting up - it took me 4 months to realize my new sneakers were the direct cause. Very annoying.

Obviously I'm freaked out- there was a rape in the area a few months ago and I've been strongly advised to not run alone (that's a different post altogether). The thing is, this hill is about three blocks from the police station where there's ALWAYS 1-2 cop cars that I have to run right in front of- I could see a police officer as this whole thing was going down. As he pulls away, I memorize his license plate number and type it into my phone and start power walking towards the nearest police car. 

I get a block closer and the guy comes back AGAIN from the opposite direction, it's fine."" He pulls around into a driveway nearby- this time I'm able to get a vehicle description.

5.	4’
6.	YES! 15 foot wall rope climb NOPE! shut down.  Someone fell and there was no cushion or mud to break the fall.  EMS shut it down before our wave
7.	Mud hole about 6’ x 4’
8.	After running through the woods for a little while
9.	Because the waves are really stacked up by now
10.	Ice pit turned out being a 4’ x 6’ x 3’ foot deep
11.	5 min wait Inflatable run?  I think this was a bungee run inflatable.  You run down it about 30’ and hop over the back wall.  Joke
12.	15 min wait, it was caving in.  Then the wall didn’t have anywhere to grab.  With it slicked down from the previous runners, the footholds don’t work.  10 minutes of my wait was watching some poor girl trying to climb and keep slipping down.  There was no way to go back or around at that point,  because of the people stacked up.  We yelled ahead for the people to help her, and they were finally able to heave her over.  We had people in our team, so we were able to work together to get through it.

Done in about 1.5 hours.  Clean up station was standing in the mud while someone shot you with a fire hose

Time for my well-deserved beer and as advertised at sign up

We wanted to stay for the Jack Ingram concert.   The cow pasture where the stage was had no shade anywhere.  There was no other food to even purchase, but the FAQ had nothing like this on what to bring.  In fact it said no outside food and beverages allowed.

No one there could tell us who was in charge

 I feel sorry for the people signing up for their Mud, and how much went to profit.  Every time I watch that video on their website, I get more pissed off.  They show real obstacles and even state five miles on the video.   If you know of a way to stop these people from doing this again, please do.

tl;dr Rip off. Terrible event and planning.

I don't have any specific reason for posting... I just have lurked on here for a while and I thought this would be something worth posting about. Wish me luck! :),t5_2qlit,True

Over the past 4 months, and much to my surprise, I've found myself enjoying these longer runs. In fact, my runs became the highlight of my days, although that might speak more to the year I'm having than my enjoyment of these runs. But anyway, last Friday I finished a 9 mile run for the first time in my life (in 77 minutes!), and I was absolutely ecstatic. I was a few weeks away from hitting my 13 mile goal; my 2 mile times were plummeting each week (11:55!); and after months of running in snow, wind

But then I felt it. A sharp, and elevated during the past two days in the hopes that it was just a strain or a some minor injury and not those two words every runner dreads hearing. **stress fracture**. But the pain continues to persist to the point where I've set up an appointment with a podiatrist. And although I haven't received an official diagnosis yet, I'm expecting the worst. 

And I'm absolutely crushed. Not because I won't be able to run the tough mudder (there will always be other races), things to help with recovery, etc... 

**tl;dr Training for essentially a half marathon. Suspect that I have a stress fracture in my foot. Devastated by it. Any tips for substitute exercises/recovery are welcome**",,t5_2qlit,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1bxayf/crushed/
