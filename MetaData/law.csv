1) Make business cards for yourself. Vistaprint makes like 1000 for five bucks. 

2) Attend every single event your school has that you have even a slight interest in. Stay after

3) Offer to help set up these events! Two of my job offers came from people I originally met by scheduling them to speak at my school. 

4) Make an excel sheet numbered 1-100. Go to your school, and find some attorneys in the current field you are interested in. Email every single one of them. Every one. Simply ask if you can buy them a cup of coffee and pick their brain. Of the 50 or so times I did this, only 3 said no. 2 never got back. It works. 

At these small interviews, ask them for a referral of others you should speak with. 

Full that excel sheet 1-100. I promise you'll find something promising before 50, I have ZERO money, and I'm not a minority of any kind. I did this on my own. This works. 

Do it. Many here will say

Screw them. This actually DOES create jobs. One of my offers was a new position the CEO had been wanting to add and he felt I'd be good for it. Even if it doesn't for you

Ginsburg writes separately for the liberal wing of the Court. Kennedy dissents. 

Updates coming as I can get them out. 

Decision is ""very complicated."" 

Plain English

&gt;The Affordable Care Act, five Justices agreed that the penalty that someone must pay if he refuses to buy insurance is a kind of tax that Congress can impose using its taxing power. That is all that matters. Because the mandate survives, the Court did not need to decide what other parts of the statute were constitutional, except for a provision that required states to comply with new eligibility requirements for Medicaid or risk losing their funding. On that question, the Court held that the provision is constitutional as long as states would only lose new funds if they didn't comply with the new requirements, rather than all of their funding.

More plain English: 

&gt;Essentially, ""the mandate can be regarded as establishing a condition -- not owning health insurance -- that triggers a tax -- the required payment to IRS."" Actually, this was the Administration's second backup argument: first argument was Commerce Clause, second was Necessary and Proper Clause, and third was as a tax. The third argument won.

The first paragraph from the SCOTUSblog write-up about it (which is still a work in progress; it was copied to the liveblog): 

&gt;Salvaging the idea that Congress did have the power to try to expand health care to virtually all Americans, the Court did not sustain it as a command for Americans to buy insurance, but as a tax if they don’t. That is the way Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr., was willing to vote for it, and his view prevailed. The other Justices split 4-4, with four wanting to uphold it as a mandate

**Roberts joins the liberal wing of the Court in UPHOLDING the mandate as constitutional.** 

&gt;For readers of the opinion

Medicaid provision is limited but not invalidated. 

&gt;***the entire ACA is upheld

According to SCOTUSBlog

&gt;***The money quote from the section on the mandate: Our precedent demonstrates that Congress had the power to impose the exaction in Section 5000A under the taxing power

` `

&gt;The court reinforces that individuals can simply pay the tax and not comply with the mandate.

On Medicaid: 

&gt;On the Medicaid issue

Also on Medicaid: 

&gt;The key comment on salvaging the Medicaid expansion is this (from Roberts): ""Nothing in our opinion precludes Congress from offering funds under the ACA to expand the availability of health care

On severability: 

&gt;The Court does not reach severability issues

**BIG DEAL: COMMERCE CLAUSE!** -- Would have struck the mandate!

&gt;The Court holds that the mandate violates the Commerce Clause

More Commerce Clause: 

&gt;Justice Ginsburg makes clear that the vote is 5-4 on sustaining the mandate as a form of tax. Her opinion, joins the key section of Roberts opinion on that point. She would go further and uphold the mandate under the Commerce Clause, which Roberts wouldn't. Her opinion on Commerce does not control.

Key language re: Commerce Clause: 

&gt;the money quote on the fifth vote to hold that the mandate is not justified under the Commerce Clause (recognizing that doesn't matter because there were five votes under the Tax Power): ""The power to regulate commerce presupposes the existence of commercial activity to be regulated."" That will not affect a lot of statutes going forward.

On the Anti-Injunction Act: 

&gt;The Court holds that the Anti-Injunction Act doesn't apply because the label ""tax"" is not controlling.

Kennedy's dissent: 

&gt;In opening his statement in dissent

**Commentary on Commerce Clause

&gt;The rejection of the Commerce Clause and Nec. and Proper Clause should be understood as a major blow to Congress's authority to pass social welfare laws. Using the tax code -- especially in the current political environment -- to promote social welfare is going to be a very chancy proposition.

At least one SCOTUSblog author disagrees with the above interpretation

&gt;I dissent from Lyle's view that the Commerce Clause ruling is a major blow to social welfare legislation. I think that piece of the decision will be read pretty narrowly.

Footnote 11

&gt;Footnote 11

As to page length: 

&gt;By the way, the four dissenters are 65 pages, followed by a short two-pager from Justice Thomas. You do the math.

As to whether the policy is a good idea: 

&gt;From the beginning of the Chief's opinion: ""We do not consider whether the Act embodies sound policies. That judgment is entrusted to the Nation's elected leaders.

I'm in a niche practice that can be litigation intensive and recently wrapped up a case where opposing counsel was unproductively contentious and just stupid. I asked opposing counsel to settle numerous times

I filed and served my Summary Judgment motion and opposing counsel actually calls my office to argue the merits over the phone.  This is not a back-and-forth intellectual discourse - it's why I was 100% wrong and he was 100% right.  I told him to file an opposition instead of wasting time on the phone.  This moron then tells me ""there's no way you're going to win"" the Summary Judgment motion.

We had oral argument and the judge was tearing apart my adversary's opposition (or lack thereof) and absence of evidence.  My Summary Judgment was continued, this idiot, still on record, begins peppering the judge with how the Court would rule under numerous hypotheticals. This judge, famously patient and nice, explains that each such hypothetical question is inappropriate.  When the judge finally leaves the room, this moron gleefully remarks on how my Summary Judgment Motion was not granted and how he ""creamed"" me. 

A week turns into three months.  Opposing counsel writes numerous 4-page letters (10-pt, (c) conditioning resolution of the discovery issue on something legally irrelevant and out of my control, and (d) babbling on public policy like a law school exam.  The judge grants the first two extensions (defendant did have very sympathetic facts) but denies the third request.  I don't like getting involved with ""correspondence duels"" and I am front of this judge all the time, so I hang back and let my adversary show his lack of experience with these letters.  Of course, he never supplements the record with his ""damning evidence.""

The Motion is for 11:00 AM and the judge comes out on the bench at 11:05 and my adversary isn't there, he would proceed to grant my Summary Judgment motion, which he would have done on the papers but for my adversary's request for oral argument.  Of course, I had no objection and the judge but his findings on the record. In the middle of this, opposing counsel tried entering the court room, but the Sheriff wouldn't let him as the judge was on the bench.  The hearing concludes, the judge leaves, but I just point to the Order. He's livid

**Vance v. Ball State**

* *Facts of the Case:* 
Maetta Vance began working for University Dining Services at Ball State University in 1989 as a substitute server. She was the only African-American working in the department. Vance submitted a complaint to the University when a coworker used a racial epithet directed at her and African-American students at the University. The University issued the coworker a written warning, Vance sued Ball State University in federal district court for lessening her work duties and ability to work overtime, forcing her to work through her breaks, and unjustly disciplining her. After filing the suit, Vance claimed her work environment continued to worsen, but the University’s investigations did not yield enough evidence to discipline anyone. The University moved for summary judgment. The district court granted the motion and held that there was not enough evidence to prove a hostile work environment and that the University was not liable for the actions of individual coworkers. Vance appealed, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the judgment of the lower court

* *Question:* Can a coworker who is vested with the authority to oversee the daily work of another worker be considered a supervisor for the purpose of determining employer liability for harassment?

[Oral Argument](http://www.oyez.org/cases/2010-2019/2012/2012_11_556)


* *Quick Analysis on Oral Argument/Possible Outcome:* A substantial amount of time in oral argument was spent dealing with the subject of the record and the actual facts in the case. This troubled some justices especially Scalia. Substantial time was also spent in oral argument comparing/contrasting Vance to a previous case on employment law. This case was [Faragher v. City of Boca Raton](http://www.oyez.org/cases/1990-1999/1997/1997_97_282). In a very messy and quick summary a supervising lifeguard was using his position of power and authority to hedge and harass a lower employee. In this case threatening/making her clean toilets unless she 'dated' him. the Court held that an employer is vicariously liable under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 for actionable discrimination caused by a supervisor. The Court also held that such liability is subject to an affirmative defense looking to the reasonableness of the employer's conduct as well as that of the plaintiff victim. ""The City had entirely failed to disseminate its policy against sexual harassment among the beach employees and that its officials made no attempt to keep track of the conduct of supervisors like [Faragher's], we hold as a matter of law that the City could not be found to have exercised reasonable care to prevent the supervisors' harassing conduct."" The comparison to this case is a little difficult for Vance. First, because in Faragher the supervisor role was readily explicit. In the case of Vance it was not. The Justices debated the record and even semantic interpretations of what it meant to be supervisor. Is the role of a supervisor dependent on the ability to affect the day to day work of said employee? Here are a couple of hypotheticals that the Justices spent some time on. A messy paraphrasing of CJ Roberts hypothetical in oral arguments: Let's say an employee can control the music in work environment and uses your distain of country in some hegemonic manner? Should the court hold the employer and thus employee supervisor liable in that case? Also is that person a supervisor because he effects the day to day of your work environment? Breyer had an alternative hypothetical.

The court might decide very narrowly. Ball State will not likely not be seen liable for a worker who really had no supervisory role practically or semantically over Vance. 

*After Thoughts*

* At one point Alito uses the same Roberts music reference but adds Wagner as potential music to abuse employees. Not 100% on this but I am fairly confident you can hear Scalia roaring with laughter at the thought in oral argument. 

* Justice Scalia and Thomas dissented in the original Faragher v. City Boca Raton. Justice Kennedy

* Despite Kennedy remaining it seems he might have wavered this time. Alito has not written an opinion in December. He is likely the author in this case. This would not bode well for Vance. My prediction is 5-4 split in favor of the respondent.

**Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl**

* *Facts of the Case:* When the biological mother of Baby Girl became pregnant she did not live with the father and the father did not support the mother financially. The mother sent the father a text message asking if he would rather pay child support or relinquish his parental rights. He sent a text back, but spelled the father’s name wrong and misrepresented his birthday in the request, so the Nation could not locate the father’s registration. The mother listed Baby Girl’s ethnicity as “Hispanic” instead of “Native American” on the birth certificate. The mother decided to put Baby Girl up for adoption because she had two other children that she struggled to support. Adoptive Couple, who resided in South Carolina, began adoption proceedings in that state. The Cherokee Nation finally identified the father as a registered member and filed a notice of intervention, stating that Baby Girl was an “Indian Child” under the Federal Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA). The father stated that he did not consent to the adoption and would seek custody of Baby Girl. After trial, the family court denied Adoptive Couple’s petition for adoption and granted custody to the biological father. The court held that the biological father was a “parent” under the ICWA because of his paternity and pursuit of custody as soon as he learned that Baby Girl was being put up for adoption. Adoptive Couple did not follow the procedural directives in the ICWA to obtain the father’s consent prior to initiating adoption proceedings. The Supreme Court of South Carolina affirmed.

* *Question:* 
Can a non-custodial parent invoke ICWA to block an adoption voluntarily and lawfully initiated by a non-Indian parent under state law? Does ICWA define “parent” to include an unwed biological father who has not complied with state law rules to attain legal status as a parent?

[Oral Argument](http://www.oyez.org/cases/2010-2019/2012/2012_12_399)

* *Quick Analysis on Oral Argument/Possible Outcome*: So this case is definitely more tricky. The Justices spent a lot of time on the ways of interpreting Congress's original intent in the statute. For example, describes how the original law itself is being perverted beyond its original and beneficial intent. Interestingly, some of the Justices went out of their way to discuss if the ICWA was still relevant. It seems a bit out of scope of the case at hand. Another interesting but maybe legally tangential point of contention concerned the Cherokee status of the baby girl and biological father. The Cherokee nation do not require ""Blood Quantums"" (or certain percentages) to be declared Cherokee. Rather, an individual has to prove a single ancestor from an official list to be considered Cherokee. The father in the case is less than 4% Cherokee and the daughter less than 2%. Alito and CJ Roberts had some trouble with the use of ICWA due the blood quantum dilemma. 

*After Thoughts*

* In an an [interview](http://www.bloomberg.com/video/u-s-supreme-court-justice-scalia-on-reading-law-BPCeR1adQeCiaqtvCSLdGA.html) with Charlie Rose

* CJ Roberts has two children

* Lisa Blatt is one of my favorite oral advocates on the Supreme Court. Sometimes there is a lot of rhetorical flourish but her rebuttal in this case cannot be missed: ""And I want you to keep in mind about this case, even though the father is a completely absentee father, you are rendering these women second-class citizens with inferior rights to direct their reproductive rights and their -- who raises their child.
You are relegating adopted parents to go to the back of the bus and wait in line if they can adopt. And you're basically relegating the child, keep off."" ""Do not disturb."" This case is going to affect any interracial adoption of children.

* Radiolab did a [great piece](http://www.radiolab.org/blogs/radiolab-blog/2013/may/30/adoptive-couple-v-baby-girl/) on the case and met the ""Baby Girl.""

* Edit: /u/borkborkbork has some insightful and astute clarifications that were not made perfectly clear before. Also who doesn't love that username? I think every judicial nominee mutters that in their sleep. ""A few clarifications about the facts in the ""Adoptive Couple"" case, and she guessed incorrectly as to which spelling he had used in his tribal registration. (Dustin/Dusten/Dustan). The baby, while within the legal definition of ""Native American"", is 3/256 Cherokee. The father is not much more than that. The mother is Hispanic. It's an interesting case, because the father had no apparent interest in playing any part in the child's life, or of having the child raised by a Native American, until he discovered that the mother was putting the child up for adoption. Had he been any ethnicity other than Native American

**UTSW v. Nassar** 

* *Facts of the Case:* Dr. Naiel Nassar, which specializes in HIV/AIDS treatment. After three years there, he left to pursue additional training and returned in 2001 as an Assistant Professor of Internal Medicine and Infectious Diseases and Associate Medical Director of the Clinic. His immediate supervisor at the Clinic was Dr. Philip Keiser, whose supervisor at UTSW was Dr. Beth Levine. After being hired in 2004, Levine immediately began inquiring into Nassar’s productivity and billing practices. In 2005, after interviewing a candidate who was of Middle Eastern descent, Levine stated in Nassar’s presence, after hiring the candidate, but the Clinic was forced to withdraw its offer after heavy opposition from the UTSW faculty

* *Question:* Does the retaliation provision of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 require a plaintiff to prove that an employer would not have taken an action but for the existence of an improper motive

[Oral Argument.](http://www.oyez.org/cases/2010-2019/2012/2012_12_484)

Due to length constraints I will recommend checking out this [post](http://www.concurringopinions.com/archives/2013/06/sole-motives-and-university-of-texas-southwestern-medical-center-v-nassar.html) on the subject. Eyer believes this might be one of the most important civil rights cases this year along Shelby. What does the role of mixed motives play in employee discrimination? No act has a single motivator and the Court is divided.

I filed a Motion to Disqualify the other attorney (long story).  It was set for hearing today.

Thirty minutes before the hearing

Fuck to the no.

So I mosey on down to court where the attorney reiterates his request for a continuance and asks for attorney fees because of my refusal of his ""reasonable request"" given the ""circumstances.""  I told the judge that I doubted the veracity of his client's statements.  Opposing counsel then pops up that he has proof, with driveway clear.  Opposing makes an argument that the firemen would not let his client drive over the hoses or some bullshit.  I asked for a five-minute recess.

I went into the hallway and called the fire department and asked for dispatch.  I got the dispatcher on the line and asked if there had been a fire at that address today

I returned to the courtroom and relayed this information to the judge

Now, I knew he would be drunk.  He currently has a suspended DL and a 3rd DUI (felony) pending.  So I go ask some of the bailiffs to stand next to the elevator and give them some identifying information, and ask them to tell me if they smell the odor of alcohol on him.

They do.  They relay this to me.

We conduct the hearing (now starting two hours late).  The judge takes it under advisement, but I put my ass on the line and risked getting ripped a new one and said, ""Judge, one more thing.  Upon information and belief of your bailiff based upon the odor of alcohol, Father is currently intoxicated.  I would request that this Court order that he immediately submit to a blood alcohol test.""

Opposing counsel goes apeshit.  ""This is harassment!  Blah! Blah!""

Judge grants my motion and orders Father to appear at a specific drug testing facility in thirty minutes.

Mother goes to the drug testing facility to pre-pay for the test because the order was made upon her request

Father doesn't show up at the drug testing facility.  Mom waits around until it closes at 7.  He's a no show

Instead, calls the police department on suspicion of DUI, they pull him over, and arrest him for DUI and DUS.

You hear people often say the burden of proof rests entirely on the prosecution in our legal system. Yet, we do know for a fact that George Zimmerman shot Trayvon Martin. So, at this point, the defense necessarily *has* to prove that Zimmerman acted in self-defense, does it not? I understand the concept of Affirmative Defense, but people are saying that Florida's bill doesn't consider SYG as such. 

So my question is this:

What, highly conflicting accounts of what happened) from claiming self-defense, and then clamming up in the courtroom, waiting for the prosecution to try and *prove* something in which the only other person who actually witnessed the events is dead? 

As I understand it, nor submit to a psychological evaluation, how is it possible to **prove** that they are not insane?

**1) AMP v. Myriad (Thomas writes

*The Court holds that natural isolated DNA is not patentable. Synthetic DNA is patentable.*

*The synthetic DNA (cDNA) is patent eligible because it is not naturally occurring.*

From the opinion: ""Myriad’s DNA claim falls within the law of nature exception. Myriad’s principal contribution was uncovering the precise location and genetic sequence of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Diamond v.  Chakrabarty,” id., at 310. Myriad did not create or alter either the genetic information encoded in the BCRA1 and BCRA2 genes or the genetic structure of the DNA. It found an important and useful gene, but groundbreaking, innovative, or even brilliant discovery does not by itself satisfy the §101 inquiry.""

**2)  Tarrant Regional Water Dist. V. Herrmann. (Sotomayor writes

(1) Whether Congress’s approval of an interstate water compact that grants the contracting states “equal rights” to certain surface water and – using language present in almost all such compacts— provides that the compact shall not “be deemed . . . to interfere” with each state’s “appropriation,” manifests unmistakably clear congressional consent to state laws that expressly burden interstate commerce in water; and (2) whether a provision of a congressionally approved multi-state compact that is designed to ensure an equal share of water among the contracting states preempts protectionist state laws that obstruct other states from accessing the water to which they are entitled by the compact.

*The Court rules that the compact does not preempt the state water laws of Oklahoma. This involves an interpretation of the Red River Compact.* 

*The Tenth Circuit is affirmed.*

*Under the Federal Rules

*""Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11 prohibits judges from participating in plea agreements

1334434106.0,s9vff,"I spent all morning writing an omnibus post about the Zimmerman case.  The elements of the crime, who bears the burden on affirmative defense, etc.  It included case and statutory citations.  Sigh.  It was 2,200 words.  Word cap is 1,000.  Here is the TL;DR",136,"So
 
1.  The state charged Zimmerman with Murder 2, (3) and while acting in disregard for human life.
 
2.  Zimmerman is pleading justification, that Martin would cause him imminent death or bodily harm.
 
3.  If Zimmerman can produce enough evidence to permit a juror to reasonably find that Zimmerman acted with justification, stated another way, **if there is a reasonable doubt about whether Zimmerman acted in self defense, the jury must acquit.**

* * *
Edit 1:  Here is the snippet from my post specifically addressing the burden of persuasion for justification under Florida law:

* * *

This is the big question that's tripping most of the people up in /r/law:  **who has the burden of persuasion on whether Zimmerman was justified?**

The answer?  There is no answer, the jury must find Zimmerman not guilty if there is a reasonable doubt of whether Zimmerman was actually justified in the killing.  Stated another way, assuming Zimmerman can produce that minimal amount of evidence, the state bears the burden of persuasion to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Zimmerman did not act in self-defense. 

Huh?

Let me explain.  Dealing with affirmative defenses in criminal law is tricky.  Why?  Because, but very profound statement, we could easily go really deep into criminal law and due process and talk about defenses that negate an element of the offense, or simply provide an excuse to the offense.  But, luckily, it's not necessary here because the Florida courts have already ruled on this exact issue:  

**if a defendant on trial for Murder 2 can raise enough evidence that a reasonable juror might believe he acted in justifiable self-defense, _So. 2d_ No. 5D09-3434 (Fla. 5th Dist. Ct. 2011)](http://caselaw.findlaw.com/fl-district-court-of-appeal/1563649.html).

From *Montijo*:  ""When a defendant claims self-defense

And a more thorough explanation from *Mosansky*:  ""[I]n a criminal prosecution the burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt never shifts from the state and, the state effectively has the burden to prove that defendant was not acting in self-defense during the commission of the criminal act.""

For those interested

* * *
Edit 2:  FWIW, very difficult time winning a conviction.  Both as to the ""ill-will"" element of Murder 2, and overcoming justification.

* * *
Edit 3:  I'm perplexed by the downvotes.  This is just a recitation of applicable law . . . .

Details: **Arizona v. Inter Tribal Council of Arizona

As part of an effort to increase voter registration and turnout, whether the would-be voter is a citizen of the United States and over the age of eighteen.  In 2004, Arizona voters approved a law that requires election officials in that state to refuse to register any would-be voter who cannot prove that he is in fact a citizen.  Arizona residents, along with voting and civil rights groups, challenged the state law, arguing that it could not stand because it conflicted with, and was trumped by, and the Supreme Court granted review last fall to consider not only whether the state law can survive

Today the Court held, Congress has the power to dictate when, where, and how elections are held, and state election laws that conflict with federal ones are therefore preempted and without effect. The Court thus held that by requiring states to “accept and use” the federal form, the NVRA effectively required the states to treat the federal form as sufficient evidence of citizenship without any additional proof, so that Arizona’s proof-of-citizenship requirement was contrary to the NVRA, the Court concluded that the requirement to “accept and use” the federal form has the stronger effect of requiring states to treat the federal form as sufficient. On the question of which legal test to apply

Finally, which creates the federal form, to include a requirement of additional proof of citizenship in the form, and to bring different legal challenges if the EAC refuses to do so.

Justice Kennedy drafted a separate opinion concurring in part and in the judgment; Justices Thomas and Alito each filed a dissenting opinion

**Salinas v. Texas.**  

Texas CCA affirmed.  Issue: Whether or under what circumstances the Fifth Amendment’s Self-Incrimination Clause protects a defendant’s refusal to answer law enforcement questioning before he has been arrested or read his Miranda rights.  Alito opinion says the defendant did not expressly invoke his 5th Amendment rights so the prosecutor can comment on this silence to police questioning.

Details: **FTC v. Actavis**
This case is an antitrust challenge to an increasingly common practice in the pharmaceutical industry.  Brand-name companies faced with generic competition pay the would-be competitor an amount of money to stay out of the market.  The payment comes in the form of settling a dispute over the validity or infringement of the brand-name company’s patent.  Because generic entry reduces drug prices

Today, joined by Justices Kennedy, Ginsburg, Sotomayor, and Kagan.  Chief Justice Roberts dissented, joined by Justices Scalia and Thomas.  Justice Alito was recused from the case.

The Court held that the government and private parties may seek to prove that these payments violate the antitrust laws.  It refused

Details: **Maracich v. Spears**
A federal law, lawyers sued South Carolina car dealers on behalf of four individuals who had recently bought cars, alleging that the car dealers had violated a state consumer protection law.  Using contact information from the South Carolina DMV, they then tried to find additional plaintiffs for their lawsuits so that they could form a class action lawsuit.  However, lawyers for the car dealers then filed a lawsuit on behalf of other South Carolinians who had recently bought cars, alleging that the use of the information from the DMV violated the DPPA.  At issue before the Court was whether the original lawsuit against the car dealers was allowed under a provision of the DPPA that creates a “litigation exception” to the law’s general ban on use of driver data; that “exception” allows the use of driver data “in connection with any civil . . . proceeding in any Federal, State

Writing for a five-Justice majority, the Court held.  The reference to an “investigation in anticipation” extends only to activities to decide whether a potential claim has sufficient merit to warrant a lawsuit, or to locate witnesses, but not activities designed to sign up clients for a case.

The Court remanded the case for the lower courts to decide whether

Joining Justice Kennedy’s opinion were the Chief Justice, and Alito.  Justices Ginsburg dissented, joined by Justices Scalia, Sotomayor, and Kagan.

**1) Oxford Health Plan v. Sutter- Kagan writing

The Third Cirucuit is affirmed. The arbitrator's decision in this case survives the limited judicial review allowed by the Federal Arbitration Act. The Court says that it doesn't necessarily agree with this arbitrator's view that class action arbitration was permitted under the contract

[Opinion](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-62_5g68.pdf)

**3) Horne v. Department of Agriculture- Thomas writing

The Ninth Circuit is reversed; the Court rules that the Ninth Circuit HAS jurisdiction to decide the takings claim in this case. The Court does not decide that there was a Taking in the raisins case -- just that the plaintiff can pursue that claim.

For example, this bully takes you aside and tells you he's concerned that your making a pretty big mistake and he just wants to help or ""mentor"" you.

"" In Vance, such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits.' ""

**Mutual v. Bartlett (Alito writes

*Issue*: Whether the First Circuit Court of Appeals erred when it created a circuit split and held – in clear conflict with this Court’s decisions in PLIVA v. Mensing

**U.S. v. Kebodoeux (Breyer writes

*Issue:* (1) Whether the court of appeals erred in conducting its constitutional analysis on the premise that respondent was not under a federal registration obligation until the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA) was enacted

*Opinion Summary*: Registration requirement under SORNA as applied to Kebodeaux falls within the scope of Congress's authority under the Necessary and Proper Clause.

*Opinion Summary Furthered:* Mike Gottlieb: ""United States v. Kebodeaux is a case about the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SONRA), the registration requirements of SONRA merely modified existing legal requirements. 'Congress could reasonably conclude that registration requirements applied to federal sex offenders after their release can help protect the public from those federal sex offenders and alleviate public safety concerns.'

*Opinion Summary*: The Court holds that Title VII retaliation claims must be proved according to traditional principles of ""but for"" causation, so the plaintiff has to meet the higher burden of proving that the employer would not have taken the challenged action (say, termination) if the employee had not filed an EEOC complaint.""

**What is bitcoin?**
For those of you who don't know Bitcoin is: Bitcoin is a decentralized crypto-currency that uses an algorithm to generate bitcoins at a steady rate.  It's basically web-cash.


Banks don't like it because it allows people to send money to each other (bitcoins) without banks.  It's competition to banks


**What did the banks do to bitcoin exchanges?**
Banks, you have to send money from your bank account to an exchange, then once you have the bitcoins you can send them to anyone around the world anytime, without using a bank and trade them for goods and services.


**Proposition: UK banks blocking transfers to Bitcoin exchanges is illegal and in violation of UK Competition Law:**


From Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_competition_law#European_Union_law

""Like all competition law

 - **Prohibiting agreements or practices that restrict free trading and competition between business entities.** This includes in particular the repression of cartels.
 - **Banning abusive behaviour by a firm dominating a market, price gouging, refusal to deal and many others.""


I know very little about the details of the law (specifically UK law) but isn't this exactly what the banks are doing? (And this is not just happening in the UK) They are defending a monopoly that should never have been allowed to exist!


Examples of this happening:
 - Mtgox

 - Today transferwise has just been banned from sending money to Bitstamp: http://transferwise.com/blog/2013-04/notice-to-bitcoin-users-april-2013  Bitstamp is a major bitcoin exchange and transferwise allowed UK citizens to send GBP to Bitstamp at a good rate.  Now they can still do it but with a SEPA transfer

 - Bitfloor

Can someone provide a watertight argument for why the banks refusing transfers to Bitcoin exchanges and closing accounts of bitcoin exchanges is illegal?
Can we take the banks to court over this? (or something that will prevent from doing this)",,t5_2qh9k,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/law/comments/1cypl6/proposition_uk_banks_blocking_transfers_to/

1337260715.0,trlfw,AMA I am now a licensed attorney who was convicted of plagiarism in law school AMA,Crumpledupthrownaway,102,18,94,"Here is the basic story:

**Background:**

To earn my final credit for law school, but I was moving and dealing with many things, and I had been warned that the time between the conviction and application to take the bar was important.  My application for the Bar in my home state was (and is) still pending, but I applied to take the February Bar in my new state.

**Process:**

The application was due in November and I disclosed as much as I possibly could.  There was a 500 word limit so I called the Bar to see if I could/should submit additional attachments.  I was told to wait and any additional requests would be sent later.  Then I waited.  I called my application analyst a number of times and she was really great, that they had forgiven me for my flaws.  I studied for the Bar, took it, and passed.   Only, my name wasn't on the online list of those who had passed. When I received the letter informing me that I had passed the exam, it also stated: ""...our review of your application and supporting documentation has disclosed issues relating to your character and fitness to practice law which will need to be addressed.""

**Results**

Although I had expected it

1. Additional reference letters.  I collected these from prior supervisors, etc.) and people who had participated with me in other organizations.

2. In the intervening year and a half since I graduated

3. When I was tried before the law school's Honor Council, ""asked a friend who had been an attorney for 3 years"".  I asked him to write a letter as the school has not been helpful.  He wrote a letter that helped show my mindset at the time and give a bit more of ""my side"" of the story.

I then had my initial consultation.  By this time, 3) of  the Board of Examiners.  At the panel, I'd be given about 30 minutes to talk about what happened and answer questions.  The panel would decide whether I was approved, denied, needed to provide further information, or they would assign me to a hearing.  If I was denied, I could request a hearing as well.  The hearing would be in front of the entire board, discovery, which he advised would cost me between $10K and $15K.  As  there is NO way that I could have paid for his representation at the hearing

I went to the panel with a sense of calm.  There was nothing more I could do.  I handed them the information I had collected (I had made five sets, I told them everything I could.  I was given five minutes for a ""closing argument."" My attorney had suggested that I use this time to draw their attention to my recommendation letters, but that had already been covered.  So I told them simply that what had happened, happened.  If I could change it, I would, but clearly that wasn't possible.  Instead, I was doing everything I could to make up for what had happened, I am now hyper diligent, if necessary

After I left, the Bar mailed me a letter telling me that I had been approved and that my license was in  the mail.  I had not expected it, but I am so relieved after the entire ordeal.  

The story is quite long

**TL; DR:** I overcame a pretty big ethical issue and figured I'd share the process for the curious.

Leading legal search companies employ armies of attorneys to read judicial opinions and generate written summaries of them. At the same time however, judges will often include a parenthetical that concisely conveys the legal substance of the decision. To date, these judge-generated case summaries tucked away in parentheticals have been grossly underutilized. The wellsettled.com engine seeks to change that by enabling users to run queries against, and only against, these summaries.

Occasionally a court will issue a written opinion containing an unequivocal articulation of a legal principle. If the common law were a biological genome, the most prevalent of which are ”It is well settled that…”  and “It is well established that…”

I don't think offering an opinion or guidance to someone on this forum, but I haven't yet seen a person on /r/law that appears to be soliciting representation from a lawyer.  Instead, what I see is people asking for legal insight, guidance or advice on a given issue separate and apart from a desire to hire an attorney.

What about Rules 4.1 through 4.3?  While those rules deal with making truthful statements to third-parties and unrepresented parties, these rules do not apply if the statements are not made to a third-party on behalf of an actual client (which, we've already established, does not typically exist on /r/law).

**So

Moreover

Lastly

1.  If the reason that an attorney doesn't want to give legal advice is because either (a) the attorney just doesn't want to

2.  I am completely open to changing my mind on this.  If anyone has an advisory opinion, please share for all our benefits.

3.  In re: the unauthorized practice of law -- I'm not sure this applies either given that there is no attorney-client relationship.  But, you could obviously give general legal advice and not be practicing unauthorized law vis-a-vis the out-of-state jurisdiction.  I find posting on /r/law no different.

4.  As a general comment, I'd argue that we have at least a moral duty to share our legal expertise with those who need a little guidance.

Thanks!

* * *

**CONCLUDING EDIT:**  To summarize the thread

(1).  Some posters don't want to offer legal guidance to redditors simply because they don't want that to be the focus of /r/law, though I'd still like to know the answer to the more substantive legal/ethical issue Internet-based advice raises.

(2).  A majority of posters think that offering guidance opens them up to an unacceptable amount of risk for either (a) ethical violations

To quickly respond -- **malpractice** is only an issue if there is an attorney-client relationship.  EncyclopediaBrown has a good citation to the Restatements on point.  An A/C relationship might be established if the redditor **manifests to a lawyer** the person's intent that **the lawyer** provide legal services for the person.  But a redditor who posts a question to a forum (and not via PM to a specific person) is not manifesting an intent to hire any **particular** person.  At least under that definition

Of course, I'd actually be very interested to read a case or two about the radio call-in shows you mentioned.  That sounds very on point.

What about **UPL**?  Again, we have very broad definition of ""legal services.""  To wit:

""(1) holding  oneself  out  as  an  attorney or lawyer authorized to practice law; or (2) rendering legal consultation or advice to a client [or a bunch of more specific stuff].""  So

Absent the malpractice and UPL issues, I'm not impressed.  Confidentiality requires an A/C or Prospective A/C relationship.  I've seen no good arguments on how that relationship might be formed when a pseudonymous person posts to a general forum on the Internet, and there's no follow-up agreement (or appearance of agreement) on representation.  I feel pretty entrenched in this position.  I'll need to see case law to the contrary.

(3).  DownandOutinParis wants everyone to know that he's a French lawyer

(4).  Thanks very much to Mr_Academic for his link to [the ABA compilation of each state's definition of the practice of law.](http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/migrated/cpr/model-def/model_def_statutes.authcheckdam.pdf)  Tres bien!

(5).  I really like the idea of adding a jurisdictional tag and a ""I'm a lawyer"" or ""IANAL"" tag to each user's name (that wants it).  I've been thinking about doing this over in /r/lawfirm for the past month.  (yes,False,,t5_2qh9k,True,,,t3_ss3vg

What am I doing wrong?",attythrowaway,83,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/law/comments/thsgy/out_of_law_school_for_2_years_as_of_today_and_i/, and I did have the opportunity to intern at a law firm one summer and a legal clinic the following fall. However

After the move I continually applied for jobs, I am itching to get into a firm somewhere and start working my way up. 

I'm currently working as a volunteer attorney, both of which were pretty embarrassing. I have no courtroom experience. I know quite a bit about immigration law but don't speak another language fluently. I'm not an expert in any other field of law, but I'm confident that if someone hired me, I would be ""up to speed"" within a week. It's just getting that chance to prove myself hasn't come yet.

There were several reasons I didn't apply myself in school as much as I should have - health reasons (severe IBS), I know that I am somehow to blame for much of this, that I'm ultimately responsible for my actions. I must be doing something incredibly wrong in my career search. I'm writing here in the hopes that someone wiser than me can shed some light on my situation. Am I going about this all wrong? Should I go to a less competitive job market? Did I ""mess up"" law school and am now sitting on several years of wasted time? Should I get my LLM? Feel free to ask or tell me anything.

EDIT: Thanks all for the advice, as it's clear that I'm going to need to make some major life changes in the next few months. As a few other posters have mentioned, my move to New York was also motivated by love, which makes relocation an even more difficult option.

&gt;An officer spotted a car with a broken rear right brake light. The officer pulled over the car, interpreting several archaic sections of the traffic code, it was actually **legal** to have one broken brake light as long as the other brake light functioned properly. The state government saw the opportunity: It accepted this interpretation of the statutes, and it petitioned the North Carolina Supreme Court only on the Fourth Amendment question of whether the stop was constitutionally reasonable even though it turned out that the officer’s belief that a broken tail light was unlawful was not correct.

The Supreme Court of North Carolina [ruled by a vote of 4-3](http://appellate.nccourts.org/opinions/?c=1&amp;pdf=MjAxMi8zODBQQTExLTEucGRm) that the Fourth Amendment permits an officer to execute a seizure based on a reasonable mistake of law.  However

If you're a solo or small-firm attorney, or if you're thinking about going solo, please read over our plan and think about signing-up.  It’s time to make the Solo relevant!",Vogeltanz,76,17, but there's no need to troll our project or our profession in this thread.

* * *

**WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?**

So, the first of which is the ""Referral Network.""  Here's the link (which contains the overal plan, phases of implementation, and how you can join):  http://www.reddit.com/r/LawFirm/comments/t716x/the_great_referral_network_project_please_read/

* * *

**MORE SPECIFICALLY . . .**

The idea is this:  grow a list of Reddit-based SSFers by jurisdiction

The goals are two-fold:  (1) if an SSFer gets a client and the lawyer needs help with either the subject matter or handling the actual litigation/engagement

Why is this important?  A BIG reason that young attorneys fear going solo is (1) cost to hang the shingle, just look up a fellow SSFer on the list and approach them for either some free advice (we're a very giving group of lawyers) or to sign on to the litigation for a fee so you can learn the ropes!  It's just that easy.

Or, maybe you get a PI inquiry?  Refer the case out and *split the fee* and *split the work* with an SSFer who does PI full time.  And, at the same time, you're learning a new field of law.

Right now

* * *

**THE REFERRAL NETWORK IS JUST THE FIRST PROJECT**

Interested in our other projects?  We're doing a start-up guide for creating your own **paperless** law firm -- from nothing to an honest-to-goodness shop, marketing, etc.  And -- FYI -- going paperless means going cheap and lean.  I'm only interested in solo's setting up shop for less than $1,000/mo overhead (malpractice and health-insurance included).

And, broken down by jurisdiction and practice area.

Again, something superior to even that.

* * *

**TL;DR**  /r/LawFirm is creating a referral-network to help Solo/Small-Firm lawyers get paying work, and overal improve their quality of work-life.  Read all about it and sign-up if you're interested here:  http://www.reddit.com/r/LawFirm/comments/t716x/the_great_referral_network_project_please_read/

Thanks for reading.

I worked for five years in a corporate setting

I graduated law school and was sworn in as an attorney in 2009. I'd kept in touch with my would-be employer, until I was able to interview for the job I originally expected to have when I graduated from law school. 

My interview went fine, encouraged me to find work elsewhere about a month after I got my rejection letter from my original job prospect. 

Of course, while I continued to look for full time regular work. My case volume was low, but I did enough work to keep the lights on. I was just treading water, though, and it wasn't really what I wanted to be doing. As such, I've been winding down my book of work while still looking for any full-time opportunity to work as an attorney. I recently wrapped up my last client matter, and am taking my shingle down. 

So far I've been unable to even score an interview anywhere since my interview in 2010. My contact at the old firm moved to a different state

I was in the top quarter of my class, I put my money where my mouth was. 

Despite being in solo-practice

I recently got a rejection letter for a job that was almost identical to the one I expected to have after law school. 

Again, I think it's a sign from God to move on. 

I have not explored contract positions, along with non-lawyer work. But at this point my confidence is basically shot, and I'm sure I'm starting to sound like a drunken guy hitting on a hot bartender to potential employers. In other words, the desperation is obvious at this point. 

I spent a lot of time being optimistic, now I'm ready to say it. Law school was a huge mistake.

* Welcome to the penultimate day for the Court to release opinions. We don't expect Windsor/Perry today but who knows.

* I hear /r/SCOTUS is quite lovely this time of year. 

-----

**Opinions** 

**1) Koontz v. SJRWM (Alito writes

*Issue:* (1) Whether a land-use agency can be held liable for a taking when it refused to issue a land-use permit on the sole basis that the permit applicant did not accede to a permit condition that, services, labor, or any other type of personal property to a public use.

*Holding summary:* The government's demand for property from a land use permit applicant must satisfy the Nolan and Dolan requirements even when it denies the permit.

[Opinion](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/11-1447_6j37.pdf)

* Florida State Court is reversed 

* Justice Kagan dissents, and Sotomayor.

* ""Significant victory for property rights advocates.""

* [Oyez](http://www.oyez.org/cases/2010-2019/2012/2012_11_1447) with the facts of the case and oral argument.  

------

**2) Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl (Alito writes

**This is a victory for the adoptive parents**

*Issue:* (1) Whether a non-custodial parent can invoke the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 (ICWA)

*Held:* ""Assuming for the sake of argument that Biological Father is a “parent” under the ICWA, he argued that his parental rights should not be terminated in the first place. And custody was never sought by Baby Girl’s paternal grandparents, other members of the Cherokee Nation, or other Indian families.""

[Opinion](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-399_8mj8.pdf)

* Justice Scalia dissents

* [Thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/law/comments/1gxfed/while_most_of_the_country_is_awaiting_the_big/) on the case from earlier this week

------

**3) Shelby County v. Holder (Roberts writes

**Section 4 is unconstitutional**

**""Section 5 is now dormant""**

*Issue:* Issue: Whether Congress’ decision in 2006 to reauthorize Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act under the pre-existing coverage formula of Section 4(b) of the Voting Rights Act exceeded its authority under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments and thus violated the Tenth Amendment and Article IV of the United States Constitution.

*Summary holding:* Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act is unconstitutional. Its formula can no longer be used as a basis for subjecting jurisdictions to preclearance. The Court emphasizes that: ""There is also a “fundamental principle of equal sovereignty” among the States, at 203. The Voting Rights Act sharply departs from these basic principles. It requires States to beseech the Federal Government for permission to implement laws that they would otherwise have the right to enact and execute on their own...Our decision in no way affects the permanent, nationwide ban on racial discrimination in voting found in [Section] 2. We issue no holding on [Section] 5 itself, only on the coverage formula. Congress may draft another formula based on current conditions.""

[Opinion](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-96_6k47.pdf )

* Ginsburg dissents, and Kagan 

* [Oyez](http://www.oyez.org/cases/2010-2019/2012/2012_12_96) page with case facts and oral argument. 

* [Voting Rights Act](http://library.clerk.house.gov/reference-files/PPL_VotingRightsAct_1965.pdf)

* [Statement](http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/06/25/statement-president-supreme-court-ruling-shelby-county-v-holder) by the President on Shelby. For those of you who do not know

* Amy Howe: ""Today’s holding in Shelby County v. Holder, no matter how small. In an opinion by Chief Justice John Roberts that was joined by Justices Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, and Alito, the Court did not invalidate the principle that preclearance can be required. But much more importantly, it held that Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act, is unconstitutional and can no longer be used. Thus

I desperately need a fresh perspective on my situation.  I gave up a highly respected public interest job to join a small firm as partner.  I liked the prestige that came with my old position, and after a couple of years I'm still barely covering basic living expenses with my current practice, which consists primarily of transactional and small business startup work.  My clients have to scrape to come up with retainers of only a few hundred dollars, and they're constantly haggling or looking to cut corners, which means a lot of time editing documents they found on the Internet and then struggling to get them to pay for it.  Because I don't have money to live on, I can't afford to take contingency work.

I love the practice of law, and each one leads to one or two new, low-dollar clients, but I can't understand how any solo or small firm practitioner makes ends meet this way.  We have a small advertising budget, but none of our efforts have borne fruit.

The more accomplished attorneys I've sought out have all basically said

Has anyone out there been in this position and come through the other side?  In my ideal world I'd be focused mostly on contract negotiation and drafting for institutional clients

1344522225.0,xxuir,Want to Be a Contributor for Reddit's First Law Review Article?,Gee10,69,21,79,"EDIT:  BREAKOUT THREADS ARE NOW UP ON /r/redditlawreview

SUMMARY:

 
We, editing and publishing of it.  It would be, as far as we can tell, the first ever crowd-sourced law review article.  
 
Our questions: Should we do it?  If so
 

THE BACKGROUND:
 
We have been working together for a few years.  H. was T.'s research assistant and, we enjoyed sending each other interesting articles, most of which were directly relevant to law, but not always.  
 
One piece was this one [http://www.wired.com/medtech/health/magazine/16-05/ff_wozniak?currentPage=all] from Wired.  It discusses the inventor of ""Super Memo, as things happen, he got waylaid and the idea was pushed aside.  
 
Fast forward to May 2012.  H. graduated
 
H. liked the spaced repetition method so much that Anki became his main mode of outside-of-bar-class-preparation.  Indeed, and confidently, awaits his bar results.  His enthusiasm got T. thinking that maybe it's time to finish that article to share the usefulness of spaced repetition for law with the world.
 
WHY WRITE A LAW REVIEW ARTICLE WITH REDDITORS?
 
For a few reasons.  First, uninteresting, and disconnected from reality.  We think Reddit is full of folks who would help us do something different than that.  Third, it's cool to be the first one to plant the flag on the moon.  No one's ever done anything like this, so why not us?  Finally, because we think it will be fun, challenging and valuable to participants and readers alike.
 
WHO CAN CONTRIBUTE?
 
Well, if you're smart, work hard and are enthusiastic, there's almost definitely a place for you.
 
WHAT'S IN IT FOR CONTRIBUTORS?
 
On the concrete level, your name will be in Lexis and Westlaw forever as part of a fun and new project and you'll get a resume line out of it.
 
But that's not really what it's about.  More broadly, and also play an important role in passing along information that should be useful to others.
 
WHAT NOW?
 
We'd like your input.  Are you interested?  Should we do it?  If there's some enthusiasm

We've created a subreddit for this topic

Considering law school just for the sake of learning. I love to read and analyze things. Honestly didn't consider becoming a lawyer however, scored a 165 (top 10%) with time left. Pretty high undergrad GPA.

I'd like to go into a top 20 law school and see where that takes me. Advice on applying or doing anything in the meanwhile?

I majored in bio/chem and minored in math/psych/scihonorsprogram/biochem while working full time as an education director


I immensely enjoy studying for the LSAT and I find it highly stimulating and personally rewarding. Studying a few hours and run a few miles a day makes me feel fulfilled.


Not sure if this matters but my father's side were all lawyers and judges in his native country. My dad is a math professor and my mother is a nurse.

I'm a strong introvert but can master things rather quickly including adapting to social situations and climbing tall hierarchical ladders and perform very well when needed (gave some great speeches at school [managed my SGO parties campaign and ran for senate] and scientific conferences). [INTJ] with INTP INFP tendencies in necessary situations.


**People with law degrees

TL;DR - I think I'm smart enough to do well in law school. Willing to work my butt off but wondering if people can give me guidance to the tools to be able to figure out what I can do with my life. Maybe internships before/during/after law school? Clerk-ships? Tips for what I can do right now before possible matriculation in 2 years? Anything?

I then resold the books in August for $275. I probably could have gotten more if I wanted to. 

Your BarBri course is basically going to be a series of lectures going over the outlines in the BarBri books. I know because my girlfriend took the course and failed her bar exam. You are not getting one bit of additional information from going to the lectures.

**3) AID v. AFOSI (CJ Roberts writes

Issue: Whether the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, 22 U.S.C. § 7631(f), which requires an organization to have a policy explicitly opposing prostitution and sex trafficking in order to receive federal funding to provide HIV and AIDS programs overseas, violates the First Amendment.

Decision Summary: *The Court holds that the policy violates the First Amendment by compelling affirmation of a belief outside the scope of the program. The Policy Requirement violates the First Amendment by compelling as a condition of federal funding the affirmation of a belief that by its nature cannot be confined within the scope of the Government program.*

[Opinion](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-10_21p3.pdf)

2nd Circuit affirmed. 

Scalia and Thomas dissent. 

Kagan recused.

**Informed Speculation**:

- We can now confidently speculate that Shelby County v. Holder will be written by Roberts. This is due to Scalia writing the AmEx decision today. This favors the plaintiffs in Shelby County. 

- We can now confidently speculate that Koontz v. St. Johns River will be written by Alito. This is due to Kagan writing the Descamps decision today. No consensus on what this means for the decision. 

- We can confidently speculate that Alito will write the opinion in Vance v. Ball State. This favors the respondent Ball State. 

- We can confidently speculate that Kennedy will write the opinion in Fisher v. UT-Austin. No consensus on what this means for the decision. 

- We can confidently speculate that Roberts and Kennedy will be writing Perry/Windsor. No consensus on what this means for the decision. 

*Speculation is based upon the monthly distribution of opinions.*

I've got a sticky case involving a claim against an estate, the new A5 coupe, the two-page spread in the yellow pages, the professional website, the works.  A purportedly nice guy, but I'm beginning to wonder about how he's treating me.

We went to mediate this case last month, who conveyed it to opposing counsel, who accepted it.  Mediator and clients left, and I asked opposing counsel to sit down and put it into writing.  Here's where it goes south.

He claims that a piece of property which I and the mediator thought was going to my client would instead remain with opposing counsel's client.  He repeatedly asserts that his interpretation of the deal is right (it's not, surrendering that property is off the table.

I don't know if he was honestly confused.  I highly doubt that's the case, and then once the mediator left, he said a different thing to me, thinking he could just steamroll me into giving up $130,000 that everyone had agreed was going to my client, and I'd have to just take it, because I'm the new guy in the county.

Also, I get the feeling that he doesn't really care much about what I have to say.

I'm not asking for a pick-me-up, where you felt condescended to, because of your age or status as the new person in town.  What did you do to get opposing counsel back in line without being a jerk about it?  I'd be happy to just write it off as a personality clash and avoid working with him in the future, but in the here and now, I've got a lot of my client's money to get back.

Thanks for any thoughts

1331329569.0,qpg72,any lawyers out there have internet addiction problems that interfere with work? I need motivation strategies,law_throwaway123,56,11,44,"I feel like I'm losing motivation. I can surf reddit for hours even though I have work to do. I haven't been too busy this month and maybe I feel like I'm underutilized at work, I have had this one freaking agreement to review sitting on my desk for *weeks*.


Part of it is that I'm not familiar with the type of agreement it is, and then in my final draft, my client pointed out glaring typo in the freaking table of contents. I'm making a very bad impression. I feel like a slow motion train wrecking dumbass, seriously. Perhaps I haven't been using my brain to its fullest capacity and I am getting dull. Perhaps my reddit/internet addiction is slowly destroying my professional aptitude. It's hard for me to read bs on the internet for four hours and then jump straight into sharp, discerning, legal brilliance that most of us are completely capable of when we are focused and put our minds to it. 


I call up one of my closest lawyer buddies and confess to him. He admits that he does that kind of thing all the time. He will have to review a document and is completely unfamiliar with the area of the law and just let it get buried for weeks. That only makes me feel a little better because I have the impression that he's super productive and I'm still surfing reddit. 

I don't work in an environment where I have to bill hours or meet production quotas or perhaps those types of things might help me stay away from time wasting on the internet. I'm just supposed to be a subject matter expert more or less on call for 2-3 major clients. I answer their emails, and occasionally draft what they need. 


So any other lawyers here have internet addiction problems that interfere with their work? What are your strategies for fighting it and staying motivated?

1302631089.0,godo0,"A law student in need of wiser, more learned perspectives on the law school, the legal culture, and lawyering in general.  ",OliveDiPace,7, this post is more related to my concerns than my impressions.  I'm just wondering if these concerns and observations translate outside of school into the actual legal industry

**[1]** For one, but sheltered and naive, do well in law school?  I can think of a lot of people in my class who work hard, earn good grades, but have no common sense or understanding about the practicalities of the real world.  What happens to these people?  Do they do well in the real world of practicing law?  In your experience, do street smarts, intuition, and practical knowledge of the real world help you more than good grades will (given your performance in legal analysis and writing is satisfactory)?  

**[2]** Second, a District Judge advised everyone to never drink at these events.  She told us that she ""would never hire anyone that was having a drink or eating at receptions because it looks sloppy.""  Was this just one uptight bitch I ran into, or is the culture of this industry really this stringent and prudent? 

**[3]** Third, we as future attorneys have a duty to be informed about the current events in our country and the political process.  No joke, some of my peers make fun of me because I like to read the news and talk about politics;  before law school, I thought law students would be all about this.  I get called a liberal hippy for some of my beliefs that remain unacknowledged by my peers.  I'm actually still shocked at the number of students that actively chose to remain ignorant and not have an informed opinion on issues, or avert themselves from having these kind of discussions.  Sure there are students who get into public interest law and the school requires us to do community service hours, but I've had difficulty finding those that take a genuine interest in social and political justice outside their career.  Maybe its just my generation, but are practicing attorney's equally detached from issues of social and political justice in the real world?  In the practicing world

**[4]** Lastly, there are many students who cannot look beyond their own side.  I think my observation is best illustrated, in an extreme, by that racist email that leaked from a 3L at Harvard Law.  What is especially scary about that e-mail is that the racist belief is written in such an eloquent way but we disbelieve it because its undisputed that the argument of it is fundamentally wrong.  This makes me think of how often law students argue minor ideas that are fundamentally wrong, but remain unquestioned because their words sound ""reasonable"" (whatever that means anymore) and bolstered by confidence.  In the past year, the law has humbled me and made me always second guess my thoughts, but it seems to have had the opposite effect on a lot of my peers.  Thus, or does a taste of the real world shut them down?  Of course as an attorney you have to have confidence is your speaking and communication

I guess what I'm really getting at here is what parts of the culture of law school remain in law school, but all perspectives and input are sincerely welcome.  These are all questions that I've wanted to ask, but never really mustered up the confidence to ask because I don't want to hurt my reputation as a negative nancy or insolent.  And if you got this far in reading this, thank you for time and interest.  Have a wonderful day.

The US is a constitutional republic, so long as what they’re voting on is legal within the confines of our constitution at that time.  The US Constitution is, of course, democratically designed – first by our founding fathers and then continually via our amendment process.  We can legally strip a particular class of citizens of certain rights that others might enjoy by (not so) simply amending the Constitution pursuant to its Article V.  

The courts didn’t free the slaves; the Thirteenth Amendment did. The courts didn’t legalize abortion so much as they interpreted it as part of the Right of Privacy that is implicit in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The courts didn’t give citizens a personal right to firearms within reasonable limits so much as they interpreted the Second Amendment as granting such a right…and that was only really solidified in DC v. Heller in 2010.

Consequently

In other words: are Prop 8 and/or DOMA violating the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and

I have a few questions and would very much like to get some understandable answers. I got in a heated debate about the legality of some of the stuff reddit is so upset about atm. One of the arguments was that something illegal happened regarding the publication of the private info of some redditors but I really didn't get the point exactly *what* was illegal about this whole doxxing thing.

So

1.) Is it illegal for a normal person to ""doxx"" someone (compile his publicly available information - including the stuff on reddit - without hacking his private accounts) and release this information on a blog (not including telephone numbers afaik but picture and name)?

2.) Is it illegal for a journalist to do the something similar and publish it as part of a newspaper article / a news website? Does public interest play a role if he can do so? Are there instances where this has been forbidden?

3.) What is a newspaper allowed to publish about a private citizen (picture, last name, shortened last name) and in what instances?

4.) Does tortius behaviour have anything do with this?
