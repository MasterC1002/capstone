Naked &amp; Famous's [32 oz. jeans](http://www.nakedandfamousdenim.com/blog/32oz-heaviest-jeans-in-the-world/).  If you felt like dropping half a grand on something ridiculous, wincing at your bruised, blistered hips.  They are labelled ""[guaranteed uncomfortable](http://i.imgur.com/MkMp5Mc.jpg),"" and they're not kidding.

They're incredibly warm, though](http://i.imgur.com/Wxe4GkR.jpg).  I wear a belt with them because I like the way belts look, not out of necessity.  These will not fall off of you.  They *can't*.

I didn't measure them before or right after I soaked them, inseam 32"", thigh about 23"", maybe 23.25"", and rise 9.75"".  At a guess I'd say the postsoak measurement on the waist was probably about 30.5"", so these have some give.  I ordinarily like a 29 in the WG cut, which is numerically one below what I buy in most other jeans

The reason that I hadn't bothered posting anything about them to date is that there wasn't much to show.  I'm a desklord.  A good chunk of my day is spent in front of a computer doing computer things in the office.  I walk a few miles a day and two or three times a month hop around at a show.  I've been wearing them since September 14, though...I'll be doing quite a bit of yardwork helping my dad out, doing some home improvement stuff, and so on.  Also the summers in this area are fucking miserable so even if I weren't *doing* much 100° humid weather will likely cause some more change.

Where are they at now

Their current appearance is the end result of near-daily wear from 9/14/12 to now.  They got rained on a bit once but otherwise have stayed away from much moisture.  I'm planning on taking them to the one-calendar-year mark and washing them then.  There aren't any signs of weakening fabric yet so I think they'll probably be okay.

1369232309.0,1eu2bt,A guide to buying Japanese clothes through Rakuten,melbat0ast,80,4,42,"###Rakuten jeans buying guide

I’ve seen some interest in buying jeans and other items direct from Japan, Rakuten makes it a hell of a lot easier and you don't have to pay any proxy fees, so that’s what I’ll write about.

###Why buy from Japan?
  
* The Yen is weak relative to the dollar right now. For example
 
* As many of you know, you should know that this isn’t always the case- do your research!*

* Some Japanese brands aren’t sold in the US. If you want something more obscure

###Why not buy from Japan?

  * The savings may be illusionary. For one, buying direct is a gamble. You *might* get slapped with import duties, which can eat up most of the $$ you saved. I went back and forth with another Redditor while making this purchase, and he indicated that he got hit with a bill for ~$70 for his jeans. Suddenly, between shipping and duties, you save nothing.

  * You should support the awesome community of retailers who bring quality Japanese shit to us. Self Edge and Blue in Green are awesome stores with very helpful owners. Although I doubt that many of the cult brands will ever really become popular enough to be “common” in the US

###What is Rakuten?
Rakuten is Japan’s largest e-commerce site, is exactly the same as Buy.com used to be. 

So

  * [Japanese Rakuten](http://Rakuten.co.jp) This is not what you want

  * [Buy.com Rakuten](http://www.Rakuten.com) This is also not what you want; you won’t find any Japanese clothes on here

  * [Global Rakuten](http://global.rakuten.com/en) This is the site you are looking for. All the Japanese is (poorly) translated into English, etc.

Rakuten offers a “points reward” system

###Merchants to look for
For buying Japanese raw denim, and [Kaizoku Pirates] (http://global.rakuten.com/en/store/pirates/). As far as I know, nobody at 2nd speaks English, the people at Kaizoku do, and I have no idea about And. There are plenty of other retailers selling raw denim, I'm just not familiar with them. I'm sure they are legit.

###Buying from Rakuten

Buying from Rakuten is just like buying from any other e-commerce site, followed by communication with the specific retailer you purchased from. From that point on, you communicate directly with the retailer until the item is paid for and shipped, at which point you will again hear from Rakuten. So, it is a bit different than, say, Amazon

  * Rakuten does not include shipping at the time of checkout: once you’ve completed the checkout process, if you don't agree with the cost, you can cancel the purchase.

  * If buying from 2nd, they will send you a Paypal link to complete the payment. Don’t worry, you won’t be charged double.

  * Although the return policy probably varies from store to store, so if you don’t like your purchase, I’d throw it on eBay.

Also

  * Pre-wash or no wash. I know that Kaizoku will do the first wash for your jeans before sending (2nd does not)

  * Hemming

  * Ask them if they will mark your package as a gift

###Communicating with sellers

If the seller speaks English, I wasn’t able to figure out what the hell was going on, but over time I got the hang of it. Just try to get the general idea of the email, and don’t worry about the details. If you can’t figure it out, members on this board (shout out to u/jawnzer for the advice) and [Superdenim](http://supertalk.superfuture.com/index.php?/forum/22-superdenim/) are helpful. Superdenim will have Japanese speakers willing to translate for you if you ask. 

This is an example of an email you might get:

&gt;こんにちは！
&gt;いつもお世話になっております。2ND(セカンド)です。
&gt;お振込みをありがとうございました！
&gt;入金確認をさせていただきましたので
&gt;ご連絡をさせていただきます。
&gt;それでは準備が出来次第、発送させていただきます。
&gt;ご到着を今しばらくお待ち下さい(^^
&gt;これからも親切、迅速、丁寧をモットーとして
&gt;努力をさせていただきますので、
&gt;今後とも2ND(セカンド)をどうぞよろしくお願いします。
&gt;失礼します。

And the translation is:

&gt;Hi there!
&gt;I have always taken care of. 2ND is the (second).
&gt;Thank you for your payment!
&gt;Since we have a confirmation of payment
&gt;I will contact you.
&gt;So as soon as it is ready
&gt;Please wait for a while now (the arrival ^ ^
&gt;The motto as kindness
&gt;I am allowed to do the effort
&gt;Thank you very much 2ND the (second) in the future.
&gt;I beg your pardon. 


So
Reply to them using very simple English


&gt;Please do not wash. Please mark as gift with low value.

&gt;洗わないで下さい。低い価値のギフトとして送ってください

###Final words

That’s really all there is to it. I ordered [my jeans](http://i.imgur.com/FO7g5nU.jpg) on Thursday, May 21. That’s faster than most U.S. retailers. However, I have heard horror stories about items being stuck in customs for 10 days-2 weeks. So, some of it is luck, I guess. 

Hope the guide is useful to some of you. You can get some really neat stuff from Japan for a pretty good price, and the possibility to return things is pretty limited. Overall, I will continue to look at US retailers first, but for things I can’t find locally, shopping through Japan is a great alternative. If there is anything else you'd like to see in this guide, please reply or PM me.

Unfortunately the last few months have been incredible busy and challenging for me, I propose the following actions to be taken:

1. I have extended an offer for MightyDerek and gravyfish to join me as mods

2. Establish who else can be added as moderators. There was a post a while back from someone who offered an incredible design and layout for the page

3. Start assembling a sidebar, and some weekly or daily posts (fadefridays, WAYWT, etc). If you guys have any ideas please chime in. One of the favorite things i saw happen on SuFu was a jeans tour in which Naked&amp;Famous supplied a free pair of jeans to be sent around to a select few members of the community and they were all able to wear them for a few months and sign them. The owner of the company is a friend of a friend, so if this is something that interests you guys i will see what can be done.

I bought these in early February. I remember getting a package at my door in the morning. I was on my way to school and I was late so I decided to take the package with me rather than take it back inside. I stuffed the package into my backpack and opened it during 5th period. They were my jeans. They felt heavy and very nice. It was a dark indigo color that i fell in love with. Maybe it was because the pants i was wearing at the time were too tight or because i was in love with my new jeans (or even both) that I skipped lunch to put on my jeans. I [changed in the bathroom](http://distilleryimage8.s3.amazonaws.com/57d5602e810c11e2aacd22000a1f932c_7.jpg) and it was really uncomfortable. I spent a couple minutes trying to pull the waistband up so it would fit. I couldn't even button any buttons. I walked to class in the most uncomfortable jeans i've ever worn. My thighs hurt a lot. 

Mom picked me up that day and we went to a festival. Lots more walking. By the end of the day

I really love these jeans. I'm gonna wear em til they fall apart.",,t5_2scl9,1371688395.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/1gowjk/unbranded_21oz_skinny_fit_100_wears_one_wash/

For those who are unfamiliar with a World Tour, he'll post updates on the jeans and what and he's experiencing in them. At the end of his period, he'll give them a cold wash, sign the pocketbag, and mail them to the next participant. This can go on for a year ideally, but if we have more willing participants we can look at extending it further. At the end, we'll have a very nicely worn-in pair of 3sixteen jeans that each of the participants will have contributed to.

The /r/rawdenim mods want to take this opportunity to solicit feedback from you guys.  What's been done well?  What hasn't?  What needs to change? How does /u/lobstertainment fade his jeans when he's on this sub 24/7?  These are all questions that need answers. 

Some quick updates on what we've been doing– (other than finals. Fuck finals.)

- We decided as a mod team to take a firmly anti-adspam position.  As such, I'll personally post fit pics of my new 23 oz raw denim briefs. 

- We've had some great ideas spring up from you guys about new info you want in the FAQ/sidebar, and even making your own jeans.  A belts guide is up, we'll work on the fade pics, but the other one will require some assistance from you guys, as we don't know anything about it.

- Jumping off that– want something added to the sub?  Write it!  We can't know everything.  We'd love to include it.

- There's now a weekly General Discussion thread

Since I work in a business casual setting, I *love* raw denim. I truly appreciate the aspect of having denim that you wear with you on life’s journey and they ultimately acquire their own unique markings and fades.

###[3sixteen ST-100x](http://imgur.com/a/9yW8X)
---

##Pros
As with nearly all 3sixteen denim, they started to become more and more comfortable. The one thing that I think is a benefit of 3sixteens is that they stretch, but NOT too much. They’ve stretched just enough to be comfortable but not enough that they lose their shape and no longer fit.

You can tell the construction on these is done with the intent on having them last for a long time. Although I’ve never owned a pair of APCs

The hardware and all the “little” things on the 3sixteen are fantastic. The buttons are all custom branded and the leather patch on the back (which is from Tanner) looks great. Everything about these denim feels substantial and solid.

Since I’m 6’10”

Overall

##Cons
I’ve experienced a little bit of fraying in a few areas but it isn’t anything I didn’t expect for something that is crafted individually and not mass produced. I’m not worried about the fraying leading to anything more serious. To me

---
###[Taylor Stitch Tailored Denim](http://imgur.com/a/5JiuP)
---

##Pros
Taylor Stitch offers a fairly decent pair of denim at a reasonable price. I won’t say that they are even *close* to being a favorite for any of my denim

I really like the red selvedge accents. I know communities are pretty split over the colored accents depending on your style

Taylor Stitch is getting into a little bit of everything. They have a lot of shorts, tees, and they all seem *pretty* good overall for their quality. I wouldn't put it nearly on par with Rogue Territory or 3sixteen. They have been releasing new products every week which is pretty cool -- and they're involved in a lot of collaborations.

##Cons
As mentioned before

Although this is a con for me, “democratic” fit. They’re a little bigger in the legs and seat which is one of the reasons they began creating denim, for bigger guys. I wouldn't purchase from Taylor Stitch in the future, but I think they offer decent denim for the ""bigger guy"" demographic and wouldn't hesitate to recommend them for that group.

###[Rogue Territory RK Grey Caste](http://imgur.com/a/BJ4WU)
---

##Pros
The craftsmanship is definitely evident in these jeans. Rogue Territory takes some pretty standard cuts and adds their own subtle but appreciated additions or changes. Unlike most raw denim

The fit on these is fantastic -- the RK have the right amount of taper without being too aggressive. These will remain in my arsenal for a long time because I consider the cut to be a little more timeless. They aren’t so skinny that I’ll look odd in a few years if that “trend” goes away but they still actually show the contour of my legs.

They utilize a split cut selvedge (which was one of the signature additions on the [Lee 101Z](https://www.google.com/search?q=lee+101z&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi&amp;authuser=0&amp;ei=s1i_UcisJMTYyQHY64CoBg&amp;biw=1680&amp;bih=935&amp;sei=5Fi_UZqUNJD_rAGzrIGgDQ)). The reasoning behind this is that

The details and hardware on these denim is fantastic. I’m pretty partial to the Rogue Territory logo so I fully appreciate the custom button hardware and the branded leather patch on the back. The loops feel solidly sewn in which is helpful if you plan to be a little more active with these.

Since this is a 10 oz denim

I like the subtle sewn accents on the back pocket since I'm not a fan of big, they'll be in my arsenal for a long time. I would definitely like to explore some of Rogue Territory's more recent additions. Over the last year or so, they've been releasing a lot of new products (awesome shorts, jackets, denim, pants).

##Cons
They are *slightly* loose fitting in the seat, there really isn't anything I don't like about these jeans.

The answer is wash your denim. yes back in the day cowboys and such went many days before their denim washed and as a result their denim  faded extremely well yet fell apart too. in the 50's in levis prime households across america washed their denim every week and hung them up to dry. and yes their denim developed beautiful fade patters. now it seems some people have a misunderstanding of why it is necessary to wash your jeans. On one hand people crave sick fades but cry when they develop a hole in the crotch. the solution is simple wash your denim. it really just bothers me that people avoid all but the simplest solution for most denim problems. this wasnt intended to be a rant but maybe next time you think about posting about a hole or smell or stain consider what people have done for ages and throw those puppies in the washing machine,t5_2scl9,True

1371734430.0,1gq46l,31oz worth of questions about raw denim,GordonRamsayRawDenim,36,2,51,"* How is weight determined? Is it a measure of thickness or is it weight per square inch?

* Why do people want such heavy jeans? Such as [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/1gowjk/unbranded_21oz_skinny_fit_100_wears_one_wash/)

* How exactly does the selvedge make it on to the jeans? According to [this](http://www.rawrdenim.com/2012/08/raw-denim-myths-the-truth-about-selvedge-denim/) site, most is obviously going to come from the center where no selvedge was woven. So when the denim is cut, a new edge is formed, do makers have another loom which re-adds the selvedge?

* Why is unsanforized in such demand? Such as [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/1gf5vb/potential_for_reddit_exclusive_gustin_order/cajtuzv) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/1gf5vb/potential_for_reddit_exclusive_gustin_order/cajoyxp).

* Why is tapered in such demand? Such as [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/1gf5vb/potential_for_reddit_exclusive_gustin_order/cajm0v5) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/1gf5vb/potential_for_reddit_exclusive_gustin_order/cajp77i)

* Why is slubbiness in such demand? Such as [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/1gf5vb/potential_for_reddit_exclusive_gustin_order/cajp77i) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/1616d2/what_brands_are_known_for_their_slubby_denim/).

* What do you wear when it rains/snows?

* How tight is the crotch on ""properly"" fitted jeans? My new gustins fit exactly to my waist size, way too long), but are giving me a bit of a camel toe with my balls. I feel like I could post on /r/datgap

* Does anyone have any empirical evidence on what causes crotch blowouts? Is it because of lack of washings or rubbing? I've worn ""mainstream"" jeans for upwards of five years and I've washed them almost after every wear and never experienced a crotch blowout. 

* Why are strange wefts in demand? Such as [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/12eg3v/red_weft/) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/1692q5/thinking_about_getting_a_pair_with_indigo_warp/).

Long time lurker

I didn't get to wear them as much as I would've liked. Pretty much rarely ever worn during the work week

I didn't do anything special or crazy. Broke them in by just wearing them around and being a little uncomfortable for a little while. Any stains or spills I just wiped up with a little water if necessary. They never smelled or got gross which was nice.

They are a little heavy for wearing in the summer when it gets hot. Luckily it doesn't get to hot in western Washington so that wasn't too much of a problem. Its great for fall/winter and the general cool climate. 

Fit deets if you care; these are a 31 and my actual waist is 31"".

Here's the deal though: through a manufacturing defect a seam next to the button fly came lose. It looks like weird / weak stitching


And [HERE](http://i.imgur.com/ZCptvpK.jpg) is another shot. The lose stitching goes all the way down the small buttons...it'll cost me about €8 to get it fixed at the tailor. Since I have to drop off some dry cleaning later anyway I'll have him fix the N&amp;F's as well.

I just gave away a pair of Nudie's on here about a week and a half ago, but I know he got them, so I hope he's happy.

These ones are great for the summer as they're only 10oz I believe.

Wearers are often seen as having failed

*****

I think about this a lot when I see comments on here, too washed out, too contrasty, not contrasty enough, too damaged or dirty, or for any other reason. But often there are people saying they're terrible and disappointing. 

I appreciate comments that focus on the aesthetic of the fades simply not appealing to that individual. But some seem to have the attitude that the wearer of the jeans failed because they didn't get good results or washed too much or washed to little

If you wear a pair of jeans every day for two years and at the end of the two years everyone on the internet says a range of ""terrible"", etc. how do you reconcile that? You can not care, obviously, and I'm sure most don't, but it seems like there's pressure for people to get good fades or else they ""didn't do it right"". There are people who make concerted efforts to fade their jeans less or differently and they're usually respected, but someone who just wears their jeans and maintains them basically could end up with something that the entire hobby's community doesn't even like. 

It's not about getting the internet's approval or anything. Plenty of raw denim wearers don't care or even know about online denim communities. But the mindset within the people who talk about the hobby that wearing jeans is inherently a contest where results are judged and picked apart seems odd to me. It would be boring if every fade was praised no matter what

A common one on Rawr Denim is that a pair looks no better than a cheap, it's that I think people are too results-centric and view results on a scale of good to bad when, for the wearer's sake and the community's, I don't know if they should be viewed like that.

I hope this leads to some good discussion since I'm not sure how I feel about it. I don't intend to criticize the community because I really do love this sub. Cheers.",,t5_2scl9,1364718758.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/1bcmlf/mixed_feelings_on_fades_being_scrutinized_how_do/

* ''ok beacon i've got some money for my first raws but dont you have to size down for stretch? what about vanity sizing too idk what i should do""

/u/Size_tts is a guy you'll want to talk to. Generally, *check the sizing charts*. It may say that it's size 30, but that doesn't automatically mean you'll get a 30 waist. A good example of this is [N&amp;F Weird guys. ](
http://tateandyoko.com/Naked-Famous-Weird-Guy-Left-Hand-Twill-Selvedge.html). See how the TAG SIZE says *28* but the WAIST is *30*? You've got to read the sizing charts to see what you're gonna get.

That was just one example. If you can't get to a sizing chart


* ok i paid for my jeans and i got em what do i do?

this is where raw denim is kinda different. some people say to just wear the jeans. others say to soak em so they fit. Personally

**How long should I go before washing?**

&gt;The general consensus here is about 1 year to get some solid fades. The general 'minimum' is 6 months. This was originally decreed by Nudie jeans

**But what about the smell?!**

&gt;Generally, right? Your legs typically don't sweat *that* much. Should you start developing any funk, there are a couple options: First, freezing. Fold up your jeans and throw them in the freezer overnight. The cold will inhibit the growth of the bacteria and reduce the smell. They should be fine in the morning. You can also put in a pack of baking soda (much like in a fridge) to help, but it shouldn't be necessary. The second option is to try [Mr. Black's Denim Refresh](http://www.mr-blacks.com/). I've used it myself and it certainly does remove smell (and restore that fresh smell).

**Anything else I can do to stop smell?**

&gt;Rather than leaving your jeans crumpled up on the floor, so they can air out between wears. Some people (such as myself) say this will yield a year of daily wear with little-to-no smell.

**Okay

&gt;A popular resource is to link to [this](http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/2011/01/20/consumer-jeans-study.html) article which shows that wearing jeans for even as long as 15 months shows no noticeable increase in bacteria when compared to as little as 1 week's wear. It is, it's not a hugely scientific study, but it should quell your concerns.

**I spilled X on my jeans

&gt; Two words: Spot cleaning. Tide to go is a personal favourite, so apply whatever cleaner from the inside. The best way to do this is to put a folded, clean paper towel down (to absorb the mess), then press the spot of dirtyness onto it, then from the inside of the jeans, apply your spot cleaner. You can use your finger or something similar to apply pressure and transfer the mess from your jeans into the paper towel. Once the paper towel gets sufficiently dirty, move to a clean spot and repeat. Do this until the spot is gone.

**Okay but it was a BIG mess of X... NOW what?!**

&gt;After it has dried, and then let them hang for a week or so. (Helpfully submitted by [Unhelpful_Scientist](http://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/12ekva/rrawdenim_answers_cleanliness_and_smell/c6uextz) )

I live in San Francisco. Early in April while reading the Sunday paper
http://www.sfchronicle.com/style/article/Gustin-offers-custom-men-s-jeans-under-100-4413003.php
At this point I had never heard the term ""raw denim"", so I was intrigued by the prospect of higher quality denim.

I liked the idea of heavyweight denim, so I thought they would be a good fit. I only considered Gustin's straight fit, because I was nervous about the lower rise of their slim fit.

I looked at the many interesting fabrics that Gustin continued to offer, and tried on both size 30 and 29. I thought the 30 fit well; it was tight in the waist and hips with room to stretch, but I didn't need to perform any unnatural acts to button up the fly. I found the 29 to be much too tight.

This gave me confidence to order another pair in 30 straight. I am partial to darker denim

In early June, which was a good thing for me. The fit was a bit snugger everywhere than my 501s. They were very comfortable after a couple of days of break-in. After 2 weeks of wear, the waist has stretched 1"" from 30.5 to 31.5.

The Heavy American denim felt really soft and supple to the touch in spite of the heavy weight. I was debating if I should pre-soak them or not, but it did eliminate most of the starch odor. When dry, the jeans had lost their soft feel and were very rigid. Some of the softness has returned with wear.

I didn't like the look of cuffs with the heavy denim so I got them hemmed to 30"". Gustin has a deal with A-B Fits to chain-stitch hem their jeans for $10, the red bar-tack on the outer hem was gone. A-B Fits told me they didn't have the equipment to recreate a new bar-tack. I complained about this on Gustin's message board, and Stephen volunteered to put a new bar-tack on my jeans if I dropped them off at the office. 

While back at Gustin's office, and my Super Light2's weren't due to arrive for a while, so I was looking for a medium-weight jean. They had #11 Standard (from Kickstarter) and #2 Japan Standard. 

I loved the look and feel of the #11 Standard, which makes me wonder if the fit guide has an error, or if I am measuring wrong. After 2 weeks of wear, the waist has stretched 1"" from 30 to 31.

I didn't pre-soak the Standards, and a desire to not eliminate their soft feel.

I had never worn jeans cuffed before, or stack them. I had A-B Fits do the hemming again, but this time I gave up on the red bar tack, since it doesn't show when the jeans are cuffed.

The break-in for the Standard took longer than the Heavy American due to the smaller size. It took about 2 weeks for them to feel comfortable in the crotch. But the fit of the 29 Standard is noticeably slimmer than the 30 Heavy American

So right now I have 2 pairs of Gustin jeans that I love, and (for comparison) my 30 501 STF. The 2nd pic of each jean shows me pinching the material at my thigh, to show how much slack material is there. I have about 2"" slack with the 30 Heavy Americans, 1.5"" with the 29 Standard, and 3"" with the 501 STF.

Although I probably have enough jeans to last me a few years now, I would appreciate it.

I hope my experience helps those considering making the move from 501 STF to Gustin.",,t5_2scl9,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/1ife9v/my_gustin_story/

They are very loose on the thigh, and has a strong taper(the taper isn't as strong as the Shearers though). They are also starchless, so it feels amazing putting these on.

*Rakuten*:

Was pretty straightforward and easy.  I ordered from 2ND shop and I rather quickly got an email from the company.  I ran it through translate to figure out they wanted me to pay via PayPal instead of credit card.  I responded back saying that's fine so he went me a link for PayPal that had the funding all filled in.  Once I payed him it was shipped out the next day.

It went from Japan to Chicago overnight where it stayed in customs fro the next two days.  From reading online that seems pretty common.  Then USPS tried to deliver it once

Here is a screen shot of the delivery process: http://i.imgur.com/RPNeDq7.jpg

*Shirt*:

The sizes for the various colors were somewhat sparse.  This is the last season's fall collection of TFH so pretty much just left over stock.  I really wanted the red color (it comes in a variety: blue, red) and the closest in my size was 36.  I knew it ran a bit small and I'm more a natural size 37.  But figured what the hell it's close enough.  If I had my way I'd get a 38 I think.  It is a bit tight when closed but I think looks pretty nice open.  So if you are between sizes I'd error on the size of the larger end.  I will note I'm a bit muscular throughout the chest and arms so this may not be gospel for everyone.  My forearms are a bit too big to comfortably snap the cuffs.

Basically it is like wearing a blanket.  The flannel is *thick*.  Really thick.  The interior fabric is soft as a bunny.  Overall the garment just screams build and fabric quality.  I see it being a fall staple for me since I like to wear vests instead of full on jackets.  The hardware is all nice with inlay of mother of pearl.  My wife is already trying to steal it referring to it as my ""$250 Snuggie.""

Here they are

[Button Detail](http://i.imgur.com/5q2E6uO.jpg)

**First observations:** The material feels much different from the denim I've traditionally worn. The texture when I first pulled them out of the bag was unlike I had ever felt. It was to be expected of course but the ""raw"" really came through. They didn't feel rough

[Leather Patch](http://i.imgur.com/fciPCHR.jpg)

**Choosing my size:** I've been a peasant bootcut jean wearer for the past few years and was looking to kick the habit so I decided what better way to be able to drop/sell all my old jeans than to have a pair of jeans I can wear everyday. Needless to say the fit of straight jeans is a bit foreign to me

[Selvedge cuff](http://i.imgur.com/oa4z60y.jpg)

**Initial Fit:** They are understandably stiff upon the initial wear. I am now about an hour in. The question are starting to arise just from general lack of knowledge on the subject. Getting to top button buttoned was a little tight but its not uncomfortable when I have the pair on or when I'm moving around in them. Thighs feel good, at first I felt like I didn't want to bend my knees. (*defiantly becomes looser and more relaxed with wear*) It seemed stiff and tight when sitting at first but feels a bit more relaxed after only an hour of wear. Is this normal to expect? If I had chosen a size 29 I would only gain .25"" in the knee area so I figure its just an area that needs to wear in. Sizing up would only make everything else looser. The length obvious these need to be cuffed to wear right now. Karl being the small manufacturer he is is able to produce more denim if the inseam is left at 36"" lucky me that I live 30 minutes outside of NYC and I can hop on the train to chain(-stiching that is). 

[Interior detail](http://i.imgur.com/1RtFYTd.jpg)

This is currently how my jeans fit. I worked out a lot in the summer and haven't done much of that since going to school this year. The only place I accumulate any flab is the bottom of my stomach and my lower back. I've been working out again to reduce this so I'm not so worried about the waist fit being just a little snug. My only concern at the moment is the knee being tight. If anyone has experienced this and can tell me that I should be sizing up or that its just part of the new pair break in that'd be great.

Prompted by a thread about black denim a couple of days ago I figure we might as well start here. The plan is to do a brief rundown on what makes this kind of denim different

**Black Denim**

Black denim, causing black dyed denim to fade slower and more evenly than equivalent indigo dyed denim. As a result, high contrast fades will be generally harder to produce on black denim. All black dye, however, is not created evenly. As I'll talk about more later, certain denim producers have gone out of their way to develop and/or use black dyes that have more indigo-like fade characteristics or even permanent/no-fade characteristics. 

There are two main types of black denim; a more traditional black warp/white weft (BW/WW) or black warp/black weft (BW/BW). 

BW/WW denim often has, /u/apotheque for showing us [these completely abused Nudies](http://media.tumblr.com/6a44512c6ac97ae54f01a7768dffcd64/tumblr_inline_mjhr8l5PKE1qz4rgp.jpg), and 3Sixteen's /u/AJChen for this pair of [gorgeous ST-200X's](http://i.imgur.com/PoLR1LG.jpg).

a)  Free

b)  Only claim these if you're truly going to wear them!  What I would love to see is somebody take them, and really solidify them.  However, if you choose to keep them as is, that's your call, just fix them.

Just got back from a trip involving a Tokyo stop where one of my main goals was to pick up an interesting pair of Japanese denim. Stumbled across this pair in a thrift store (Komehyo

Denin: Feels raw

Fit: Waist was listed in store as a ""medium"". Probably a 32 as it fits my true 33 waist a bit tight. Cut looks to be tapered and slim; they fit somewhat like my weird guys with a higher rise and shorter inseam. 

Details: The first thing when I noticed when I put these on in the store was what I thought was reinforcements running down the legs. Turns out these are raw denim bone cutouts of your femur/tibia glued on the inside of the jeans in the appropriate position on both the front and back inside of the legs. GHxRN branding abounds, and GHxRN patch on the back pocket. Most of the stitching on the jean is half contrast, half indigo which looks awesome in my opinion (one stitch line is orange, one indigo). Button fly buttons are white powder coated metal of some type with the top button bearing some GHxRN branding. Leather patch is thick and embossed with some GHxRN graphics. Back most belt loop is diagonal for no apparent reason. Pictures don't do the color justice, but they've got a different hue than my N&amp;F LHT Indigo's.


Regardless of rarity or true value I think these are a really cool pair of raw denim with many interesting but fairly subtle touches. What do you guys think? Sorry about the lighting/picture quality,False,,t5_2scl9,1360623473.0,,,t3_17jkcf

I was lucky enough to have him select me as his winner thus becoming the owner of my very first pair of selvedge pants! I was ecstatic. After about 6 months of being a frequent lurker on /r/denim and learning so much about raw denim and selvedge pants I had been wanting my own for months. I could never come up with the extra cash to get my own because I'm a broke college student that is many thousands in debt and my job just barely covers my bills. I cannot thank FearAndSickness and his wonderful girlfriend enough for this. They even included a goody pack with stickers and candy from Paris! I have been wearing the pants almost every day since and it is the most fun to tell the story about them.


FearAndSickness is an outstanding guy and deserves an upvote from everyone. This is the second giveaway he has done. Thanks for everything FearAndSickness+GF!

They are 31 waist, but feel great. Only worn 4 times. The cuff is way too much, but that's bc they were not hemmed enough and the pants came too long, even after they measured me out. Going to have to hem them again. Bit upset about that. Wonder if Self Edge will do it again for free. Doubtful. 

Couldn't speak highly enough about the service though. Well worth the money! See you guys in a few months to a year after a wash.

I'm currently working on a java application to help find what brand and cut of denim is right for you. It's just a fun thing because I wanted a project for the summer. I took a programming class last year and I want something to do over the summer to practice and build upon what I learned. I am also using this as a chance to better understand XML.

How it works currently: 

You enter your preferred (either measured from a current pair or estimated) measurements of the waist, knee, and leg opening. The program then runs through a large data file compiled with measurements from many models of jeans in all sizes. It then outputs a set of jeans that fit fairly close to the inputted parameters. 

I have a request for the help of the community:

1367445921.0,1didsu,Thought I'd share my experience with my Size 30 APC Petite Standards - 1 Month old,RichardKim,21,4,25,"http://imgur.com/a/hkIWZ

Bought on March 30th. No washes, Worn cuffed, Worn every single day for one month. Size 30 and stayed true to size or maybe sized down 1 not exactly too sure. The fit pics (only pics I had with my jeans) were taken April 28. The stand alone flat pics were taken May 1st.

I got these APC's exactly a month ago after a friend recommended buying some raw denim jeans for work. When I first got em it took me about 10 minutes of dancing in the dressing room to button the top button and my leg could barely bend (I got some big thighs). But after 2 nights of sleeping in them they are probably the most comfortable jeans I have worn. They are a little loose in the waist, I put my wallet and cellphone in my back pockets and a zippo in the coin pocket. I noticed the crotch area is fading as well, but oh well. 

Sorry about the lack of the fit pics. My house is too dark to get a decent fit picture

Just thought I'd share my first experience with raw denim. I freakin love these jeans and the fit.

My current favorite pair of jeans are some [uniqlo skinny fit tapered in indigo](http://i.imgur.com/WPOGULi.jpg) (that's me in the pic. I'm 5'11 145lbs

However, which creates bunching and stuff. 

I think that means the waist is too big

Another concern I have based on my current jeans is the crotch height (the purple line in the picture). Another reason why I wear them lower is because it feels a bit roomier in the crotch region. I'm worried that if I get a smaller waist and wear my jeans higher

**Options:**

I have done some preliminary research

[Rogue Territory SK](http://www.rogueterritory.com/store/sk-12-5oz/). The smallest these go is 28, but I'm not sure if it will account for stretch. I may need more of a 27.

[3sixteen ST-100X](http://www.3sixteen.com/collections/denim/products/st100x-slim-leg-raw-indigo-denim). These also only go down to 28

There is also the [UB101](http://www.theunbrandedbrand.com/denim/ub101/). It's much cheaper than my other options

So that's the research I have done so far. Let me know if there is any info I can add

Here is a picture of the tracking of the package. I received the package at 12:00 August 16th
http://imgur.com/AXLsYwo

Everyone asks the question of import duties and 2nd was very helpful with marking as low value 15 000 yen and as a gift. If the price had been over 20 000 yen I would be subject to 16% import duties 


The jeans arrived in a shipping envelope and bag and with a beautiful hand made fan and of course my flat head 3002

I HIGHLY recommend this process. The   Chances of getting hit with duties are present and exchanges can be tough but if you do your research you could save quite a bit of cash ( I saved over $100) and have a beautiful pair of new denim!

On the fifth wear of my st-200x I was sitting down on my couch and leaned forward to put my shoes on and the top button cracked off.  The metal split in a way that the back of the button is still attached but the front fell completely off. Anyone have any idea what I can do to have then repaired or had a similar experience?  I don't think I'll be able to do a straight return as I've had the jeans hemmed.

* Original Purchase was 1 size down

* Now I am wearing a 31 and the waist is about perfect but the stretch on the thighs and seat made them flair.

* Unfortunately I cannot find my original fit pics that I took the day they arrived.

* They are about 4.5 months old.

* I wear them 2 or 3 days a week and wore them every day for around 1 month.

* Total wear is probably around 1.5 months.

Tailoring

* This was a pretty awesome experience.  I brought them in last week along with 3 Uniqlo OCBDs that I needed hemmed. (I am wearing one in the new fit pics).

* He pinned them up so I could see how they would look and we went with it. We took off about 1"" at the thigh to about 1.5""-2"" at the cuff

* Total price for 3 shirts and slimming 1 pair of pants... $31!

* I was expecting just the pants to be $40 so I think I made out like a bandit.

Pros:

* The fit is MUCH better now

* Most of the fading that was already happening is still looking normal. Will have to wait and see what they look like with a few more months of wear.

Cons:

* He did not keep the same kind of seam on the inside so if I cuff there is no longer a selvage line. Fortunately I never cuff my jeans. [PIC](http://i.imgur.com/OZwwaYk.jpeg)

* The knee bulge/fade moved over by about 1 inch. It is now clearly not centered and some of the fading is slightly cut off by the seam.  This is pretty noticeable to me but I think with a month or so of wear it should all even out since the knees were not super faded to begin with. Not sure if anyone else would notice.

http://www.rawrdenim.com/2011/09/fade-friday-naked-famous-x-blue-in-green-weird-guy-9-5-months-0-washes/

After seeing those pictures I knew I needed a pair, calling every raw denim dealer I could find and N&amp;F directly, I finally found a pair. Tate &amp; Yoko had one pair, they aren't the exact same pair in that Fade Friday, but they are the same fabric and cut (the only difference being that there is no BiG branding and they are not chainstitched). 

The only problem was that they were a size smaller than I would normall wear in a WG (I would size down 2 to a 29, I ordered them immediately. When I got them they were everything I dreamed they would be and I started wearing them immediately, however the size was a problem, they were just too small for me and that paired with the stiffness of the fabric made them a nightmare to squeeze into every day. I finally stopped wearing them after the top button popped off. I considered them a lost cause and moved onto a pair of APCs. However after completely destroying that pair I have come back to my grail N&amp;Fs. I got the button put back on, they have stretched out a bit and softened up, so they aren't such a trial to wear every day, they are still very small

I'm not sure exactly how long I have been wearing them because I took a long break, I honestly don't know. However they are starting to show some great fades, so I figured I would post them here.",,False,,t5_2scl9,,http://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/1dz0p6/nf_21oz_wg_evo_pics/

I recently gave away two pairs of denim on here; I messaged a lot of people stating that if I came across anything else I'd let them know.

Now, most of us like the same brands here (from what I could tell), so I was wondering how you guys (and especially the mods) would feel about me posting non-denim related clothing on here. I earn enough and I live comfortably, so I wouldn't post anything for sale, I'd just give everything away again. I know there are subreddits like /r/assistance, but I love the feeling of the small community and lack of shit talking on here. Newbies are always treated with respect, no one is being bashed (unless they're begging for it) and I'd like to keep this within ""the family"" if you know what I mean.

If you sign up for a new gustin account using this link

 &gt; [https://www.weargustin.com/invite_from/2018](https://www.weargustin.com/invite_from/2018)

You will get $25 off your first purchase of $80 or more [[source](http://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/1gai7k/40_credit_for_gustin_jeans/caitll1?context=3)] and **I will get a $10 credit**. Your credit card will not be charged instantly



The credit will not expire quickly [[source](http://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/1gai7k/40_credit_for_gustin_jeans/caigl0n?context=3)] but no firm date is set on when it will expire. It is not permanent though and they will send you an email before it expires.



If you do not want me to get $10 then you can use this link

 &gt; [https://weargustin.com/invite_from/3](https://weargustin.com/invite_from/3) 

Which is straight from gustin [[source](http://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/1gai7k/40_credit_for_gustin_jeans/caigl0n?context=3)]. That will give you $20 off and no one gets a kick back (because it is from gustin).

To explain the socks and sandals.. I had on wool socks and waterproof boots since it was cold and rainy out - took off the boots - had to take my dog outside - Chacos were much easier to slip on = socks and sandals.  Plus it's a pretty awesome look.  By the way

Got both on sale last month

This is my first plunge into raw and I have a limited budget so this seemed like the way to go.

I wear a 33/32 in normal jeans or pants. 


**Levis 501 Shrink-To-Fit Selvedge**


I took others advice and ordered the Levis slightly large, but I really liked the fact that they are not low-rise.

When they arrived, and the waist fit quite well. The legs, however, were pretty baggy still, and they were still too long for me.

I wore them for a couple weeks and then soaked them again to see if I could get them to shrink some more. They did, but still are baggier and longer than I'd like.

The quality of the jeans are better than I'm used to with cheap jeans

Overall I'm happy with them


**Gap 1969 Straight Selvedge**


I bought these after the Levis

I soaked them immediately, much more than the Levis did. Maybe I need to soak again?

They fit a lot better than my Levis, and more comfortable as well. Unlike the Levis which I bought long, these are the right length without rolling. I can get away with a small roll if I want to.

I feel like the quality of the denim is not quite as good as the Levis

I'll try to check back in a few months if they start to develop fades

**EDIT1**
Will post pictures later!

Levis only had even numbered sizes, that's not my experience.

Sorry for the low quality self shots.  I was in a hurry to get out the door to work.  I also apparently forgot how to tie my shoes in the one picture to not look homeless.

My latest two buys.  Thanks to /u/raisin_bran_in for the heads up on the sale from Need Supply Co. where I got these Momos for $180.

Thoughts on jeans:

* Fantastic construction and great denim

* Still really tight and hopefully will loosen up

* Worst indigo bleed of any pair of denim I've owned


I performed a warm soak on the jeans yesterday hoping to soften up to denim to let it expand quicker.  Already they're feeling much better after about 1h of wear.  However after soaking for about an hour last night I noticed even the water splash on my walls from taking them out of the tub and hanging them was leaving indigo all over my walls.

Wallet:

* Great quality leather.  Very soft.

* Construction appears stellar

* Still unsure if it popping out of my pocket is a good look

* Still unsure on the leather chain

Basically what I'm trying to figure out is the hype over Japanese manufactured jeans over American-manufactured jeans made with japanese denim? Is there any reason to to pay an additional $100 - $150 for brands like Iron Heart or Flathead over brands like 3sixteen and Rogue Territory? Is the quality of stitching or details better than the American brands?

My thoughts/review. ,FartSnob,12,0,7,"I'm pretty new to the raw/selvedge jeans and the pricing of the Unbranded denim seemed very appealing.  I have a pair of grey levi's that have seen better days so I decided to replace them with [this](http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/catalog/productdetail.jsp?id=19141134&amp;parentid=M_BOTTOMS) pair of Unbranded jeans from Urban Outfitters.

The UO site lists these jeans as the UB101 model but the tag on the inside of the jeans says UB106.  I'm pretty sure it's the same skinny cut

Fit pics:  [Front](http://imgur.com/a1Zjc) [Side](http://imgur.com/mUPm1) -Bonus laser cat!

I haven't seen any pictures, almost silver.  Almost makes the jeans look a little dressy.  I think the color will only get better as they fade out.

My thoughts:  I normally wear 511's and my size is 30x32.  All of the info I saw online said that these run small so I ordered them in a 31"" waist.  At 31 the Unbranded definitely fit tighter than my 511's.  The advice to size up 1-2 sizes is spot on.  I'm hoping mine stretch out 0.5"".  A lot of people said the pockets are shallow and this was also accurate. They are a little shallow, fabric quality all seem to be top notch and comparable to what I've seen in the N&amp;F Skinny Guy.  Fit also seems to be the same as the N&amp;F Skinny Guy.

Overall I'm very happy with the jeans.  I don't think the grey is going to give me super high contrast fades but I'm eager to see how these wear.  I'm for sure going to cop a pair of the 20+ oz UB101's when they come out this fall.  

I had trouble finding info on these jeans so I thought I would share my experiences for the next guy.  ",,t5_2scl9,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/11il88/picked_up_a_pair_of_unbranded_ub106_skinny_raw/

Excuse the awkward poses... no idea how to get the jeans to look normal. I don't normally tuck my shirt in but I wanted to show the jeans in how they would naturally sit.

I've been wearing these 3 pairs of jeans for a while. Basically I've always had a huge ass and big thighs. Recent leg gainz has only made it worse so I think it's time to retire these beasts and find one or two new pairs. 


Does anyone have any suggestions? Can you tell from the pictures where I need to increase in size? For me it feels like the thighs/crotch are really tight. The indigo ones have shrunk and not stretched back out (probably due to a ton of crotch repairs) and don't have much mobility anymore. I haven't worn them out in a long time.

All three are Naked and Famous size 32 Weird Guy. The indigo pair have maybe a year's worth of wear on them

Would a sized up pair of weird guys fit better? Maybe a slim guy? I have also been thinking of trying a pair of SL-100x or SL-120x to see if they would fit in the thighs. FWIW I'm in Edmonton

**TL;DR** Looking for a fit check/suggestions for a new pair or two. Took a bunch of awkward pictures with an iphone.

* I expected them to be rigid and painful for a while.  They are rigid, because they felt great on right away.  The slack weave really helps too,  they are really pretty airy for 21oz denim and I see no issues with them being a year-round jean.  They also have sort of a stretchy quality thanks to the slack weave.  I really love the material, best denim I've worn, and I look forward to it softening further over time.

* The fit is great.  I'm 5'10 170, but even on my average frame with developed, but not ridiculously huge, legs and glutes they are plenty slim for me.

* If there is a complaint for me, really big back and front pockets, triple-stitched inseam and seat...  They are built like a tank.  I would hope for interior selvage detail on the fly and triple stitching on such a premium jean.  If they made a triple stitched, lined variant with big pockets in this denim it would be the PERFECT jean for someone like me, who buys stuff to last.  I don't know that the back pockets need lining given the weight of the denim though.

Having perused the FAQ and the basic guide to raw denim I’ll (hopefully avoid) asking truly basic questions. I mostly wanted to post because I’m leaving for a 2 and a half week trip to Japan in two days and I plan to hit up (at least) Hinoya (any/all of the 3?) and Americaya in Ameyoko (Ueno) and also the Pure Blue store in Harajuku while I’m in Tokyo to try to pick up my first 2 − 4 pairs of raw selvedge denim jeans. My goal is to pick up a few pairs (a couple indigo

Questions:

Should I take a little tape measure with me to measure jeans in the stores? I’m worried about the language barrier here

Is it worth going to more than one of the Hinoya stores? Is the selection different enough between the stores? Are there other stores not on my list that would be good picks?

Should I go for sanforized/one-wash jeans since it’ll probably be a little difficult to do an initial soak on several pairs of jeans while I’m traveling? I guess the benefit would be that I could instantly start wearing a pair (or two?) while I’m traveling without having to worry about serious shrinking whenever I do get around to actually washing them the first time.

I promise to keep detailed photo album cataloging my experience from week 1 forward.  I'll post updates every so often (but not too often

I'm ~5'7.5'', as I'm sure it is for many other people on this fringe of the weight/size spectrum (I've seen a few posts about this in MFA).  So I searched long and hard to find good raw denim that fit my measurements.

I didn't really want to order APC after seeing some horror stories about the side seams coming undone.  I didn't want to order unbranded because it felt too common- if anything

I was so excited when I finally found [a pair of jeans](http://www.gilt.com/brand/scotch-soda/product/175029292-scotch-soda-dean-raw-denim) I could get down with on Gilt.  They were marked down from $246 to $119 and I used a 20% off coupon to make the cost even better (you can try gilt20 or 20gilt to see if it still works...).

It doesn't say on Gilt, so I'm not sure if they're just cut wrong and that's why they're on Gilt or if I just didn't expect them to taper that much.  I usually like to wear Express 28 fitted, and I'd say that they're quite a bit tighter toward the bottom of the legs than I am used to.  The crotch is very spacious, which is great, because I hate having my balls crushed by pants (curse you Dockers 28 slim!).

**Fit:** My best fitting pair is no longer made, ""chuckin slim"" converse by varvatos. It's very lightweight and feels a bit stretchy. My only complaint is that the rise is a tad short and I'd like the opening to be smaller.

Here are the measurements of the best fitting pair with some notes on fit:

* Label Waist = **31.0""** (also what I wear in Levi's true-to-size) 

* True Waist = 34.5"" (hard to measure due to age / stretchiness)

* Front rise = 10.5"" but should go up to **10.75""**

* Thighs = 22.0"" but they stretch.

* Actual Body's Thighs = **24.25""** with jeans on

* Knee **8.25""**

* Opening = 15.0"" but want to come down to **14.5""**

* Inseam **32.5""**

I have just recently gotten into raw denim. And while, the break-in can be a bit of a pain in the ass. And biking with raw denim is not a lot of fun. For instance, my first pair are UB201s, and while they fit great when I am just walking, sitting can be uncomfortable and biking is downright impossible right now. I found a [blogpost on rawrdenim](http://www.rawrdenim.com/2012/09/5-more-raw-jeans-for-cyclists/), but they are (a) oldish and (b) none of the jeans are available in Germany (which is where I am from). Plus my thighs are fairly big (no Greipel but I don't skip leg day), so finding jeans that fit is a bit of challenge anyways.

So, the Weird Guy Stretch Denim be a good choice for me?

So I have been really getting into this raw denim thing lately. I started with a pair of STF 501s and moved on to a pair of UB101s. 

I just got the 101s back from a tailor because I needed to have them slimmed for a better fit

My next step is a pair of shadows or indigo/indigo because I really love the color of the ones I have seen.

I understand why someone would pay $200+ for a handmade item similar to the ones in [this post](http://imgur.com/a/jkxBu#0)

But for the major brands that everyone talks about

Aren't they all just dark wash jeans in cuts that are basically the same as what you can get for much less in a box store like H&amp;M or Gap?

Does a $200 pair last twice as long as a $100 pair or will I get twice as many people asking where I got those amazingly well fitting and obviously expensive pants?

Don't get me wrong, will a $300 pair look better than a $80-$100 pair?

*Fit #1: APC Petit Standard

*Fit #2: Baldwin Henley

*Fit #3: Levi's 501 STF

**ABOUT EACH PAIR**  

Being a Minnesota native, and again when it was made known that they sold [Justin Vernon the suit he wore at the 2012 Grammy's](https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/2/13/1329115004145/Justin-Vernon-aka-Bon-Ive-007.jpg).  

I had an entire afternoon to myself, are both very cool dudes. I was mostly helped by Satchel, and we shot the figurative denim shit for a few hours while I fitted everything from Tellason to Japan Blue.  

I debated over APC, while I know they get scrutinized for quality and durability, produce some amazing fades (Satchel has a pair of 18-month APCs on display in the store. They're insane). Baldwin because I have family ties in Kansas City, and it's always been an unsung home for me.  

If you're anywhere near BlackBlue for any amount of time

The Levi's 501s were a birthday gift from December. I've worn many pairs of 501s and thought I could shrink down a 30x36 to fit more like how a 29x36 might. Nope. So I took matters into my own hands and modeled them after my 29x34 pair. I ended up taking them in a lot more than I anticipated

Overall I'm really excited to start wearing these jeans. I'll probably cycle them so it could be a while before I see any real noticeable fades.

One thing I am having trouble adjusting to is the size of the leg opening. I don't mind the relaxed feel of the straight cut leg (it's actually what I wanted) but what I do mind is the way these stack with basically anything but boots. Because the leg opening is wide they drape over any sneakers and look more like a boot cut rather than stacking.

I'm hoping that as the denim relaxes this will become less apparent but must say I'm considering having them taken in .25 to .5 of an inch at the hem / leg opening.

1. talk me out of it
2. has anyone done this?
3. do you think they will stack better as the denim relaxes?

The craftsmanship on these jeans is amazing. The inside stitching just looks perfect and I know no tailor in Australia will be able to match that factory quality so I may be compromising the construction. However as it's inside stitching in a low wear part of the jean chances are not much.

*****

I thought this was fun to make (did it about a month ago, doesn't stretch or warp the belt-loops, doesn't rub off anywhere, and it's easy to hang my jeans up and take them down. All that said, I can't recommend a similar design unless you're cool with the... Unpolished... Appearance. I'm just hanging them in my closet, not to display, so I don't mind it. Sharing just for fun and who knows, but it's not the most complicated of DIY projects.)

[**Final Product**](http://i.imgur.com/Hgdg3y6.jpg)

I couldn't sleep one night and decided I needed a hanger for my soon-to-arrive denim (jeans are the [3sixteen ST-211](http://www.3sixteen.com/products/st-211-slim-tapered-overdyed-black-denim) by the way). I'd seen the [Self Edge hangers](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yLvrYuQy2oE/TkRtH6UTh1I/AAAAAAAARVw/FQNUVclWu5w/s1600/Selfedge-1.jpg) as well as other people's interpretations and creations and knew I wanted to make something similar. I considered just cutting and bending a single wire hanger

I began with three hangers like [this](http://i.imgur.com/QSouzrF.jpg), I used pliers with a shorter and wider end, similar to [these](http://www.wholesalelighting.co.uk/images/thumbs/0006510_256.jpeg). The wire bent easily. I felt the additional surface area helped and made it require much less muscle. It took awhile to get the curves somewhat symmetrical, and you can tell they're still a bit off. As long as they were close enough to not affect how the jeans sat I didn't mind.

At this point, less pretty, baby Self Edge hangers. Keeping them all lined up was already annoying and I knew I needed to set them somehow, at least a bit, before binding them. (Otherwise I'd end up with a misaligned, bumpy hanger.) The solution? [These](http://i.imgur.com/UbegciI.jpg?1). If you've ever had braces (or you're an orthodontist, who knows), it would keep that single spot on the hangers together but

I still wanted to cover it though. The bands aren't the strongest and were meant more as a guide than a final binding. I have some extra-strength masking tape (it really is quite strong) at my house

Masking tape makes for a poor surface on anything, multiple layers everywhere (the parts that don't look wrapped - the left arm, mainly - are just still smooth and stuck down). At first it looked nice-ish, like a poorly done lacquer job. Eventually, as the static of the wrap wore off and general wear from the jeans being pulled off, it grew a lot messier. 

I also made [a hook](http://i.imgur.com/ggISwAr.jpg) that was really... Resourceful..? I wanted some clearance from the wall so the jeans could breathe and wouldn't get dusty, thin nail inside the thick cylindrical piece visible, after I'd hammered that piece through the top hole in my ""hook"" and added elastics to keep it in place (visible in [this](http://i.imgur.com/KrEgSU6.jpg) side view, along with overflowed rubber cement). Bending that thing into a hook with pliers (one in each hand; didn't have access to a clamp) did a number on my hands but it now fits my fat hanger well. After the piece was put together it was easy to tap it into the wall, since the nail itself is pretty thin. Plenty strong for a load of a pound or two though. [This](http://i.imgur.com/CHGB0HL.jpg?1) side view shows the slight dip caused by the jeans. Still enough clearance that, facing the wall, only the knees graze it

Finally

All in all, probably better, in about 20 minutes, and you could probably do it with stuff you already have lying around, like I did. Most people don't have tiny elastics available, but you could use another method to keep them lined up before binding.

I know this isn't directly denim related and it's kind of silly

About 6 months ago I noticed the stitching along the fly start to come undone. I did my own hack job of repairing the seam and carried on. [Picture of the repaired seam](http://i.imgur.com/YmjyNwo.jpg?1).

Since then several other issues have popped up:

Is this kind of wear and tear to be expected? How common is it for stitching to come undone? Could this be caused by a bad fit and/or too much dirt buildup in the fibers?

I am about 5'6, football, and run a lot, so finding the right fit for my fluctuating thighs has always been a #1 concern for me. My waist is about a 30-31, but I find that irrelevant if my thighs/ass don't fit. 

I picked these up at the Dutil Vancouver location and asked them for help in sizing regarding my larger thighs. I first tried on the A.P.C. Petit Standards, but with a more tapered leg, which was perfect! She then ended up giving me a collaboration pair with IDC (International Design Collaborative, a brand from Toronto), which I thought was pretty cool considering it's signed by both Brandon Svarc and IDC, has a unique patch, and is limited to 50 pairs worldwide.

[Here's a link for more info on the collaboration

I managed to fit my thighs into a size 32 and they fit me like a glove. I know the waist will stretch out quite a bit more, which I am totally fine with seeing as muscular legs in tight denim isn't a good luck! So far it's been 2 months of daily wear and no washes, and I am loving the fit and the way these are turning out, which makes documenting them even more fun.

I've noticed significant wear in my left front pocket where I keep my Samsung Galaxy SIII, honeycombs, and crotch region show quite a bit of contrast in the sun which I like. Another cool thing is that I found that my jeans had dyed my phone case green!

So I just bought my first pair of high quality jeans from SelfEdge 2 and half weeks ago. Thought people would like to know how I thought about them. One thing I should mention is that I'm a really tough critic. A good article about my views can be found here: http://dcurt.is/the-best

The first thing which I'd like to mention is the stitching. There are two places where I can pinpoint problems
http://i.imgur.com/Q3cnX.jpg
Maybe this isn't a big deal
Another stitching problem which I couldn't take a picture with is in the back pockets. The stitching in the back pocket sticks out real rough to the touch. Every time I'm reaching for my wallet my knuckles get a sharp nick reaching in and out of my back pocket. Lately I've been finding myself using my thumb and mid finger to claw my wallet from the sides in order to not sink my hands in the jeans. Maybe it will loosen up after more wears but for now

Weird crease: http://i.imgur.com/RXay0.jpg
Not sure why this is happening to my pair

r/rawdenim

I added the Tellason's because my APCs were pretty worn in with &gt;1 year of wear with no wash and a crotch blowout repaired by me. The Baldwin's are great but are a much slimmer cut so get much less wear because they're not as versatile as the straighter cuts of the APCs or the Tellasons.

My question has to deal with something I've only experienced with the Tellasons: dye bleeding into my clothes. Most notably bleeding onto my shoes (very noticable on sneakers)

I want to keep the Tellasons dark and wear them much

Thanks for your advice!

Which gets to the stitching. Chain stitched details on the bib, so they may be hopeless in that regard. 

Some nice detailing, tool pocket, two deep waist pockets, hammer loop, butt pockets, and chest pockets. The left chest pocket has an interesting access, and the logo buttons on the chest are snaps. Lots of red bar tacks at stress points. White contrast stitches look nice.

Detailing issues: Would be nice if the Round House buttons were properly aligned (some are riveted in upside down). The stitches usually have barely finished ends. Lock stitched hem.

All in all, especially if you are willing to taper the legs a little bit. For a pair of work horse overalls, with a raw touch, these are pretty damn good.

1351962483.0,12kjem,New to raw denim; a question about sizing,,10,2,6,"I'm completely new to this whole Raw Denim thing

I'm a very skinny guy, if not all, raw denim brands size linearly, if that makes sense, with one waist size corresponding to one and only one length. This presents a problem for me, since my waist is as skinny as my legs are long, if that makes any sense.

Specifically, or [these ""petite"" jeans](http://uscheckout.apc.fr/browse.cfm/4,1678.html?nav=denim). I understand one is supposed to size down when buying raw denim, due to the jeans stretching with wear.

I guess I have two questions

1. My best fitting pair of jeans is a pair of Levi's 511 (skinny)
2. What size should I go for

Thanks so much! Let me know if there's any more information I should provide to help with these questions.",,t5_2scl9,1351982644.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/12kjem/new_to_raw_denim_a_question_about_sizing/
