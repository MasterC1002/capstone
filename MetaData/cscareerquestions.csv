1375639655.0,1jov24,Here's How to Prepare for Tech Interviews,RunninADorito,307,32,51,"Almost all of the questions posted in this sub are some form of ""what do I have to know/do to pass a tech interview/get a job.""  Here's some distilled advice I can offer from having conducted over 1000 tech interviews.  This doesn't cover everything


Setting expectations:  If this is your first time looking for a job, but some college students do as well.  You're essentially studying for a test, don't slack off - it's going to be work.  All of those things that you've been telling yourself don't matter (maybe you're a bit fuzzy on how exactly the internet works - do you really know what happens after you hit enter on the URL bar?) that you don't know - now it's time to address those gaps head on.  So, what matter.


For the sake of space




**Data Structures**

Go to wikipedia and read the whole page of each of these a few times

* Array
* Linked List
* Stack/Queue
* Trees (Tree, Red-Black Tree, etc.  Learn as many as you can)
* Heap
* Hash Table (this is really important - understand all of the different collision mitigation mechanisms
* Directed/Undirected/Weighted Graphs
* Trie (pronounced ""tree"")
* Linked Hash Map (this is very specific

You should know the Big-O for insert, etc. for each of these.  Know how the mechanics work.  It isn't a good interview questions, but you should be able to code every single one of these.  Then, prepare real-world examples of when you'd want to use each of these and explain why it's the best choice.  Data Structures come up in technical interviews in two way.  The first is in coding questions where you're expected to use the right one at the right time.  The second is on a comparison question - not connected to code - ""why would you use X over Y in situation Z.""




**Algorithms**

Again

You don't have to go crazy here

* Sorting algorithms (both comparison sorting and non-comparison sorting)
* Tree traversals (just memorize all of these inorder, level order)
* Traversals - Dijkstra's, DFS (know the difference between DFS and BFS when would you use one over the other and why - hint, is usually matters when you don't have to search the whole space.  Also make sure that you can code recursively and using your own stack/queue)
* All the prefix-tree searches




Great, cracking the coding interview, etc.)  Code answers to those questions.  I strongly recommend forcing yourself to pretend you're in an interview setting.  Most of these questions should be solvable in ~10-15 minutes, some will be more like 20-25.  Time yourself.  Before you write a single line of code, organize your thoughts and figure out the entire solution, then start coding.  The coding part should be boring and straightforward.  In the actual interview, do the same thing.  Before you write a single line of code




**Fill Gaps**

This is where you get to be honest with yourself.  That long list of things you don't know that you keep telling yourself is ok because the stuff you don't know isn't actually important....well

* Writing code - (I put this here half as a joke.  I can't tell you how many people with 15+ years of experience lose their mind when I ask them tow write some code with me.  These ""architects"" do not end up getting jobs.  Same goes for managers and other support positions.  I know that you're not going to write production code
* Bits and Bytes - Yes
* How the internet works.  This applies more to companies....yeah....it applies to everything these days.  You should know how sockets work, it should only take a couple of hours.
* Databases.  Learn some basic SQL and data modeling if the job you're applying for uses databases.
* Learn a bit about testing.  Write some code and test it.  What's TDD
* If you've only ever used Windows....consider using linux for a bit.
* Whatever else you can think of.  A good mental exercise is to imagine yourself in an interview...""man


The good news is



**Behavioral**

Alright, be energetic, be excited about the company, know what they do, have ideas about what they could be doing.  You're almost certainly going to encounter some behavioral interview questions.  You can prepare for these.  I suggest coming up with 3 situations where you were working on a tech project and things went well, and 3 stories for when things didn't go well.  Then practice telling the stories, make sure to include some setup information, what was the project, save the company money



**Parting Words**

Get a good nights sleep and do the best you can.  Expect to fail at some of these interviews, but interviewing is a game.  Don't try and fight the rules or think it's stupid.  It is what it is and that's what's standing between you and the job you want.  Learn to play the game and win by practicing :-)


Best of luck, we all know how little fresh college grads know, we factor that in to the ramp-up process.  Be prepared to work hard.


**Edit:**
I'm just going to put some more things as I think of them down here.  I didn't think people would find this information so useful. 


**Don't Sell Past the Close**
To all you extroverts out there, your performance is best reflected when you're relaxed.  Freaking people out is expensive because some awesome engineers just freeze up when overly stressed in interviews (I've also found little correlation between interviewing-stress-paralysis and real-world-fire-drill-paralysis).  I'm nice because I don't want to exclude certain types of introverts from the hiring pool.  The other reason I'm nice is because extroverted people think we're friends.  We aren't friends, I'm interviewing you.


I don't care how much you think you're clicking with your interviewer.  He's invited you on his boat already


It's human nature to want to form bonds with people and one way we make friends with people is by doing this elaborate dance of sharing secrets with people.  Early on there's a tendency to share some extra truths


""Yeah, I only really had to work 5-6 hours a day to get it done.""


""I know I'm not supposed to say this in an interview


Don't over-share.  If you think something is going to make you look bad


Exceptions to this rule:  There are a few things that people think are bad which are perfectly fine:
* Admitting you don't know something (better than making stuff up)
* Asking questions to make sure you understand the problem
* Saying that you're a bit nervous and want to take a couple seconds to compose yourself (totally fine


You can be friends with the interviewers you like after you get hired.  Don't give people reasons not to hire you for free.",,t5_2sdpm,1375657542.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1jov24/heres_how_to_prepare_for_tech_interviews/

1364572063.0,1b8wa3,Why You Make Less Money,fecak,152,15,19,"[Original here](http://jobtipsforgeeks.com/2013/03/29/less/)

Have you ever had a conversation with a fellow technologist that you felt wasn’t quite at your skill level,000?  As someone who has had a great deal of access to the salary and compensation details for thousands of software engineers over many years, I can report that there can be significant variation in salary between technologists with almost indistinguishable skills and qualifications.  This may not be news to some, but some of the reasons might not be obvious to professionals in the field, particularly if someone has only been exposed to a small subset of industries or companies.  Many of the explanations are somewhat unique to this industry or at the very least more prevalent in the software world.  Regardless of whether or not money is a primary motivator in your career, it is still useful to understand why others may be earning more (and what you can do to earn more).

***What are some possible explanations as to why someone equally or less-qualified makes more money?***

* **Public image and intangibles** - An average technologist may be compensated above more productive co-workers if there is some advantage that the company sees in that person’s employment.  Community influencers such as open source project leads, speakers, and authors may all fall into this category.  In business this is the concept of goodwill, where an asset has a higher value due to an intangible.  Google’s high profile hires of  James Gosling and Ray Kurzweil and Dropbox’s hiring of Guido van Rossum came with a certain level of goodwill bundled.  On a local level, a company may believe that hiring the local Python group leader could make hiring Python pros easier and less expensive, which may justify a higher salary independent of the developer’s quality or production.  Regulars on the conference speaker circuit can ask for a premium simply based on the PR provided every time their bio is published on an event website.
* **Negotiations and raises** - Software professionals are often stereotyped as unskilled or uncomfortable in situations where they are negotiating or asking for raises and perks.  This first requires the courage to ask for more (as a raise or starting as a new hire), raises, and most importantly it has some bearing on salary at your next job.  Think of starting salary as the principal level for compound interest.
* **Market knowledge** - Remember that conversation alluded to in the first line of this article?  If you had three or four similar interactions within a year
* **Self-promotion** - Even if the high skill level is there
* **Consulting differential** (both independent and staff) - Developers that are independent consultants charge clients a premium to account for expected frictional unemployment and to address the fact that a temporary employer typically will not make any real investment in the career of a temporary employee.  It is rare to see independent consultants sent to conferences or trainings by their clients, etc.  Salaried employees of consulting firms are also often paid above other similarly qualified professionals, as it is easy to measure a consultant’s contribution to the firm’s net revenues based on bill rates, billable hours, and their compensation package.  There may also be regular travel or variable commute that tends to inflate salaries.  Salaried consultants who know their bill rate, utilization, and total compensation package have a distinct advantage when trying to justify their value (and salary) to an organization.
* **Profit vs Cost Centers** - Similar to consulting
* **Rare skill** - The premium paid for even one single rare skill among many common skills can be substantial.  When a new language, or platform is hyped as the ‘next big thing’ and adoption begins, even junior level talent with that skill can earn above more generally qualified individuals.  This is simple supply and demand for a scarce resource.  In years past the premium was greater for rare skills, as companies today seem more confident in their ability to train an existing resource than to hire someone new and much more expensive.
* **Time expectations** – Some employers pay a premium because of the high expectations they place on hires.  Unless you have some vested interest in the success of the company (stock, and some are willing to sell.
* **Long tenures at big companies** – Many large organizations have systems of pre-determined fixed raises and regular bonus or vacation increases for certain milestones.  The hire’s value to the company increases over time as they become highly specialized in a certain environment, the result is brutal.
* Location – No explanation needed

***Conversely

* **Startups** – Startups often exchange equity for cash compensation.  These employees are often earning less for the opportunity to receive a big payout.  Candidates negotiating with startups must place their own figures on the value of the equity
* **Benefits, tuition reimbursement, and childcare can be major expenses that are covered by some employers and often not included in discussions. 
* **Experience value** – The opportunity to work for certain companies, and shops that provide that ability may leverage that during negotiations.  Many developers are entirely comfortable with accepting compensation below market as a trade-off for the positive effect on their career and marketability.

**Conclusion:**

If the topic of compensation comes up with other technologists, the numbers become even more skewed.

How does a technology professional go from being consistently and happily employed for a number of years

**How do certain people get job offers without having to even interview?**

It isn’t simply about skill

In my experience, I see this first hand on a daily basis.  Let’s start with the habits that are the least obvious and progress to some that are more widely practiced.

* **Interview** - How often do you interview when you are not actively looking for a job?  For most the answer is never, with the added benefit that these same interviewers may be working at new companies in a year or two.  One interview could lead to an ‘in’ with four or five companies down the road.  Second, it is the only way to keep interview skills sharp.  Interview practice is best done live without a net, and failing the audition for a job you truly wanted is often attributed to rusty interview chops.  Even a simple informational interview request (made by you) is an effective and creative way to make first contact with a potential employer.

* **Know when to leave your job** – Without question, as older technologists that have made smart moves do not typically have this issue.  I would add that older engineers who possess the habits outlined here are the group being hired without interviews.  There are always exceptions, but tech pros can stagnate quicker than those in other industries due to the speed of change in technology.
The definition of job hopping has morphed over the past fifteen years, someone who has remained at a company for many years may be viewed by employers as loyal to a fault and potentially unambitious.  If this person has solid skills, why has no company picked him/her up yet?  Changing jobs before stagnating is critical to overall employability, and how quickly you stagnate will vary based primarily on your employer’s choices, your own ability to recognize that stagnation is happening, and your desire to not let it happen.

* **Make ‘future marketability’ a primary criterion when choosing jobs or projects** – Carefully consider how a new position will impact your ability to find work later in your career and use that as one of your key incentives when evaluating opportunities.  Details about your roles and responsibilities as well as the company’s technology choices and reputation in the industry are all potential factors.  Does the company tend to use proprietary languages and frameworks that will not be useful later in your career?  How will this look on my résumé?  Many candidates today are choosing jobs or projects based on an opportunity to learn a new skill

* **Reach out to others in the community (not coworkers)** – How many times have you sent an unsolicited email to someone in your field that you don’t know?  “Congrats on your new release, and the character limit can actually be advantageous (no babbling).  If you stumble on an article about a local company doing something interesting, there is much to be gained by a 140 character pat on the back. This is essentially networking without the investment of time.

* **Lunch with others (again, which leads to honest discussions about the experience of working at a company that you may consider in the future.  It’s also an opportunity to learn about what technologies and tools are being used by other local shops.

* **Public speaking** – This is an effective way to get attention as an authority in a subject matter

* **Attend a conference or group meeting** – This isn’t to be confused with going to every single meeting for every group in your area.  Even getting to an event quarterly keeps you on the radar of others.  Make an appearance just to show your face and say hi to a few people.

* **Reading and writing about technology** – One could debate whether reading or writing has more value, LinkedIn or Google+, and make a point to read at least a few hours a week.  As for writing, even just making comments and discussing articles has some value, with perhaps more value (for job hunting purposes) in places like Stack Overflow or Hacker News where your comments are scored and can be quantified.  Creating your own body of written work should improve your understanding of a topic, demonstrate your ability to articulate that topic, and heighten your standing within the community.

* **Build a personal code repo** – Many in the industry balk at this due to the time required

**Conclusion**
At first glance, but at least a few require very little commitment.  Employ a few of these tactics and hopefully you will never suffer through a prolonged job search again.

In January, speakers and a career fair.  At this career fair, I met recruiters from various companies (Microsoft, Morgan Stanley,..etc).  After briefly speaking with the Amazon recruiter, I was referred to one of the Amazon engineers also standing at the booth.  I spoke with the engineer for a few minutes, at the conclusion of which, he took down my information and told me that Amazon would be in touch.

I didn't think much of it at the time.  The recruiters were seeing hundreds of people per day and, to my surprise, I received an email from another Amazon recruiter requesting that I attend an interview at their Seattle office.

I was pretty stunned.  After my brief encounter at the career fair

The interview itself was very coding heavy.  I can't really go into specifics but, I honestly did not think very much of my performance.

Two days after returning home (on my birthday, I was stunned.  I have been rejected by a few other companies after having performed (in my opinion) much stronger interviews.  Long story short, I accepted the offer.

Over the course of my career I have scheduled thousands of software engineering interviews with hundreds of hiring managers at a wide array of companies and organizations.  I have learned that although no two managers look for the exact same set of technical skills or behaviors

Obviously, anything else that happens during an interview is irrelevant.  For that technical skills assessment, you are generally on your own, as recruiters should not provide candidates with specific technical questions that they will be asked in an interview.

It should be helpful for job seekers to know where others have stumbled in interviews where technical skill was not the sole or even primary reason provided for the candidate’s rejection.  The examples of feedback below are things I have heard repeatedly over the years

**Candidate has wide technical breadth but little depth** – The ‘jack of all trades’ response is not uncommon

**Candidate displayed a superiority complex or sense of entitlement** - This seems most common when a candidate will subtly (or perhaps not so subtly) express that they may be unwilling to do any tasks aside from new development, but will also be careful to acknowledge their willingness to perform any relevant tasks that need to be done.

**Candidate showed a lack of passion** – The lack of passion comment has various applications.  Sometimes the candidate is perceived as apathetic about an opportunity or uninterested in the hiring company, the technology, or the people, chances are the interview is a waste of time.

**Candidate talked more about the accomplishments of co-workers** – This piece of feedback seems to be going viral lately.  Candidates apparently ramble on about other groups that built pieces of their software product, and everyone else in the company, yet they fail to dig deep into what their own contribution was.  This signifies to interviewers that perhaps this candidate is either the least productive member of the team or is simply unable to describe their own duties.  Give credit where it is due to your peers, but be sure to focus on your own accomplishments first.

**Candidate seems completely unaware of anything that happens beyond his/her desk** – Repeatedly using answers such as “I don’t know who built that” or “I’m not sure how that worked” can be an indicator that the candidate is insulated in his/her role

**Candidate more focused on the tools/technology than on the profession** – Although rare, and many candidates only wanted to work for companies that were using EJB. When a technologist is more focused on becoming great at a specific tool than becoming a great overall engineer, companies may show some reluctance.  This is a trend that I expect could grow as the number of language/platform choices expands, and as fanatical response and the overall level of polarization of the tech community around certain technologies increases.

**Candidate’s claimed/résumé experience ≠ candidate’s actual experience** – Embellishing the résumé is nothing new.  A blatant lie on a résumé is obviously a serious no-no

**Candidate’s experience is not ‘transferable’** – If your company is only using homegrown frameworks and proprietary software, but when given a different set of tools, methodologies, and team members, the candidate may encounter too steep a learning curve.  This is often a response on candidates that have worked within development groups at very large companies for many years.

Give some thought to these before your next interview.  I’m always interested in comments if you have some other feedback that you have seen regularly.

**1. I have an offer for employment at $X
For 99% of you: **NO** absolutely not. Your degree will be more valuable in the long run
**2. I have an offer from company X and am still waiting to hear from company Y
If you like both companies
**3. My offer is $X
First do research on median salaries in your area, *typically* it seems about 10% more is ok, more than that may be pushing it. Use your best judgement.   
**4. Tips for handling recruiters:**   
Try not to tell them what you are looking for in a salary or what your previous salary was, and they may conduct a short interview with you, if they ask for more than that it is probably sketchy! Use common sense and go with your gut.    
**5. Should I do this unpaid internship?**   
Almost always: **NO**, or perhaps if your school has some sort of arrangement with local industry and unpaid internships have been normalized in your area **and** you can't find a better way of getting experience and getting paid for it!   
**6. I didn't find a summer internship
Find other avenues to keep practicing and building your skills. Open source projects, so start early in contacting recruiters for semester internship opportunities instead. But your world is not over if you don't get a summer internship. You just have to work harder to get that great summer experience. (thanks /u/catiebug)   
Many colleges have something going on during the summer you can help with. For example
**7. My offer expires soon and I haven't heard back about negotiations
This is a tough situation. I would email the Recruiter to make sure it is documented. You want to make it clear that you're planning on taking the job, it would not be right for the company to hold you to their deadline. (thanks again /u/catiebug !)

Thanks for all of your encouragement. After being axed in March, inclusive management style. I'm going to pay it forward by offering my thoughts on the incident.

Before:

* I ignored red flags. Lots of people left while I was there. One person had to leave because the company allegedly missed a deadline for filing his visa paperwork, punishment and gossip seemed to be their main tools of leadership.

* Disliking my job made me reluctant to leave. Like an abusive relationship

* The company was performing poorly overall. The company's valuation slid 30% in the week after I was let go. Three months afterwards, were replaced. 

After:

* I set my alarm every morning and got fully dressed as if I was going to work.*

* I spent as little money as possible and looked for ways to make money under the table.

* I kept busy and studied upon new technologies. I made a flash game and an iOS game

* I applied for new jobs steadily but not frantically. I looked for things that seemed like great fits

* When my interviewer asked about why I was fired, even though I don't think I was at fault and was just working for a shitty, poisonous company, I can't control other people's actions.",,False,,False,t3_ymo17

Had one phone interview with their client and they loved me


So, and I have two interns until the 16th, so I told them I'd like to stay here until the 16th, which would have been three weeks. Absolutely not. ""The client doesn't want to push the project back another week"". I end up having this back and forth three times with three different people at the recruiting firm. So, I'm in a moral quandary; do I not accept this position and just stay at the current employer until I can find something else or do I screw my current employer (which honestly has been GREAT, close to perfect) and just take the job with the new place on the date they insist on?

I actually choose option C: get on the phone with a buddy of mine and get hired at a THIRD job the same day.

So, told them ""hey thanks, but I can't start on that day, and I don't want to work anywhere where they won't allow me to gracefully leave a current employer. Good luck with the search.""

My phone instantly started ringing off the hook.

Long and the short of it: talked to some director this morning, they would have made it happen. I told them that I don't like being lied to, and I'm not coming to work there.

He lays into me: you're lazy, you'll never work again.

The interview was held over Skype

programmers only do so after some draft of the code has been created - not
line-by-line using the fail-fix-fail workflow recommended - I know it’s bad
we just don’t do it). We would write a bit of code
quickly ask, and in the heat of the moment I just had no
fricking clue what to do next. Deer in the headlights. What is perhaps most
frightening is that I left the interview thinking I did well. I knew I stumbled
in parts

The recruiter was kind enough to gather feedback and follow-up with me the
following week. They said I was “smart

enterprise level organization (like where I am currently employed) rather than a
start-up that will likely only have two or three devs (they are not really a

I come from a poor background. In my home town, or gas station attendant) without a high school diploma. I left high school at 16 to work concrete. College just doesn't entire into these people's minds as a possibility. The culture is very anti-intellectual as well. 

I've always liked math and science a lot. I was always described by teachers as a ""gifted"" student in these areas

I had no idea how a computer worked, etc. to find books on electricity, circuits, and anything else remotely related to computers. I learned a lot about capacitors, transistors, cathodes, etc. but never really figured out the operating system part.

Eventually, was I ever fascinated by that. Every spare moment I'd be trying to learn something new on there. I figured out that I was an intelligent person and felt my mind was being wasted stripping roofs and digging holes in the ground. I started to come across the term ""computer programmer"", but I had no idea what that meant, but I very badly wanted to find out. The colors on the screen, the mouse movements, the start-up/shut-down functions, I knew it was all simply the very rapid interaction of hardware, and something else...which turned out to be code. I read books on C

I ended up getting my GED in 2005. I was 22 years old. I applied to the local state college and to my astonishment I was accepted. This is not a very good school at all, which I did not have.

Going to college meant moving into the ""city"" part of the county, and I explained that division is easy for those numbers and you can just follow a step-by-step process (which I learned later was an ""algorithm"") for arriving at the answer or best approximation. 

The nice ladies of HR recommended me for this other job, and some other stuff. The computer were all green-screen IBM terminals and the computer system was a mainframe. I'd never heard of one. I just knew I liked Windows better. This job paid like $10 an hour though so I was practically rich. 

I worked overnights and went to school during the day. I was even doing over-time and pulling 60+ hours per week. My life revolved around a series of naps, but I would read the entire book for a class in the first couple weeks, do all the practice problems, and do well.

I love the programming stuff the most. This was the answer I'd been looking for for a while. You take a language a person can read and create a basic set of instructions that the computer can compile, my job got moved to a new office because we got a new data center for the warehouse. Now we had Windows XP PCs to work from and everything. They also expanded the responsibilities of the job as the company updated it's technology. I became a helpdesk, network ops, Unix, and mainframe operator all rolled into one, still working full-time and going to school full-time.

As school went on, because without the job I couldn't pay for school, and they would throw me out and it would have all just been a waste. As I learned more about the company, I switched majors to Business. 

After three years, pretty, and very mean girls. They came from schools like Cornell, and the company paid them top dollar to recruit from top schools in order to bolster the companies profits with top-tier graduates and their Ivy-League intellects. I was told that they don't hire low-tier scum like me and to get back to my till or leave. 

I felt awful. Before, realizing the caste system I was up against. I stuck around that job for another year or so but ultimately went back to my old habits of studying computer science and mathematics. I signed up at the college again to finish the degree I originally stated.

By that time, to which they said they would need two years. I said I've given my required two-week notice (I actually gave them three) and I would happily work out my final time training someone else as best I could. They fired me on the spot. 

Unemployed, number theory, self-balancing search trees, and cryptography. I started to like Java a lot and made that my main language. I learned everything I could about Java and the VM; whenever something presented itself that seemed like hocus pocus I just learned how it was working, like concurrent threading or how the VM does garbage collection, and what exactly happens to methods on the stack and objects on the memory heap at run time. 

Finally

I feel like I'm in no better of a position to get a job other than gas pump monkey. Like I said before, and I'm still in that lower caste no matter how I rationalize it. I spent approx. $100,000 of my own hard-earned money earning those pieces of paper but I realize they are practically worthless. 

Every day, and let me tell you, those people aren't smarter than me, and they don't do anything that I can't do. 

I see a lot of questions on here about the interview. I know I could impress people given the chance. I know CLRS by heart and have seen every video CS lecture Stanford

I typed out that long story because I feel like there are more people out there like me

Is there anything else I can do besides randomly apply to jobs on Dice? I already know the advice some of you are going to give, and there's no projects a person could possibly create that are going to impress people who work on multi-million dollar software projects with millions of SLOC.

At least a handful of readers told me that they didn’t get the job because they didn’t even get the interview.

With a down economy, perhaps 300 résumés without getting even one response.  These anecdotes are often received by sympathetic ears who commiserate and then share their personal stories of a failed job search.  To anyone who has sent out large quantities of résumés without any response or interviews, I offer this advice:

    The complete lack of response is not due to the economy.  The lack of response is based on your résumé

My intent here is to help and certainly not to offend, “the manager wasn’t a good judge of talent“, etc.), but now it’s time to take a look inward on how you can maximize your success.  I spoke to a person recently who had sent out over 100 résumés without getting more than two interviews, and I quickly discovered that the reasons for the failure were quite obvious to the trained eye (mine).  The economy isn’t great, but there are candidates being interviewed for the jobs you are applying for (most of them anyway), and it’s time to figure out why that interview isn’t being given to you.

If you apply for a job and don’t receive a response

    a mistake made during the résumé submission itself
    problems with the résumé
    your experience.

Qualified candidates that pay attention to these tips will see better results from their search efforts.
Your Résumé Submission

Résumés to jobs@blackholeofdeath – The problem here isn’t that your résumé or application was flawed, presence and frequency of these words.  HRbot apocalypse…
Solution – Do some research to see if you know anyone who works/worked at the company, as recruiters are typically sending your information directly to internal HR or hiring managers.

Follow instructions – If the job posting asks that you send a cover letter, this request serves two purposes.  First and most obviously, they actually want to see how well you write (cover letter), your experience (résumé), and the price tag (salary requirements).  Second, they want to see if you are able and willing to follow instructions.  Perhaps that is why the ad requested the documents in a specific format?  Some companies are now consciously making the application process even a bit more complicated, which serves as both a test of your attention to detail and to gauge whether applicants are interested enough to take an extra step.  Making it more difficult for candidates to apply should yield a qualified and engaged candidate pool
Solution – Carefully read what the manager/recruiter is seeking and be sure to follow the directions exactly.  Have a friend review your application before hitting send.

Spelling and grammar – Spelling errors are inexcusable on a résumé today.  Grammar is given much more leeway
Solution – Have a friend or colleague read it for you

Price tag – As you would expect, if you provide a salary requirement that is well below the range, you will also not get a response.  Huh?

Suppose you want to hire someone to put in a new kitchen, and the third is 2K.  Which one are you going to choose?  It’s hard to tell, but I’m pretty sure you aren’t going to use the one that quoted you 2K.  Companies want to hire candidates that are aware of market value and priced accordingly, and anyone asking for amounts well above market will not get any attention.
Solution – Research the going rate for the job and be sure to manage your expectations based on market conditions.  Another strategy is trying to delay providing salary information until mutual interest is established.  If the company falls in love

Canned application – By ‘canned’ I am referring to job seekers that are obviously cutting and pasting content from previous cover letters instead of taking the time to try and personalize the content.
Solution – Go to the hiring firm’s website and find something specific and unique that makes you want to work for that company.  Include that information in your submission.  If you are using a template and just filling in the blanks (“I read your job posting on _____ and I am really excited to learn that your company _____ is hiring a ______”)

Too eager – If I receive a résumé submission for a job posting and then get a second email from that candidate within 24 hours asking about the submission, there will probably be lots of hand-holding and coaching required to get this person hired.  Reasonably qualified candidates with realistic expectations and an understanding of business acumen don’t make this mistake.
Solution – Have patience while waiting for a response to your résumé
Your Résumé

Your objective – If your objective states “Seeking a position as a Python developer in a stable corporate environment“
Solution - You may choose to have multiple copies of your résumé with multiple objectives

Spelling and grammar (again) – see above

tl;dr – To any non-geek readers, but I still get seven page résumés from candidates.  I have witnessed hiring managers respond to long-winded résumés with such gems as ‘if her résumé is this long, imagine how verbose her code will be‘. (Even for non-Java candidates!  #rimshot)  Hiring managers for jobs that require writing skills or even verbal communication can be extremely critical of tl;dr résumés.
Solution – Keep it to two or three pages maximum.  If you can’t handle that

Buzzword bingo – This is a term that industry insiders use to refer to résumés that include a laundry list of acronyms and buzzwords.  The goal is to either catch the eye of an automated search robot (or human) designed to rate résumés based on certain words, you can be sure the recruiter or manager will pass based on credibility concerns.
Solution – I advise candidates to limit the buzzwords on your résumé to technologies, leave it off.
Your Experience

Gaping holes – If you have had one or more extended period of unemployment, or left on maternity leave.  Don’t assume that managers are going to play detective and figure out that the years associated with your Master’s degree correspond to the two year gap in employment.
Solution – Explain and justify any periods of unemployment on your résumé with as much clarity as possible without going into too many personal details.  Mentioning family leave is appropriate

Job hopping – Some managers are very wary of candidates that have multiple employers over short periods of time.  In the software world it tends to be common to make moves a bit more frequently than in some other professions, or that you may get bored after a short time and seek a new challenge.  Companies are unwilling to invest in hires that appear to be temporary.
Solution – If the moves were the result of mergers, or a change in company direction, be sure to note these conditions somewhere in the résumé.  Never use what could be viewed as potential derogatory information in the explanation.  Clearly list if certain jobs were project/contract.

Listed experience is irrelevant/unrelated – This could be a symptom of simply being unqualified for the position, and are willing to open up their hiring standards a bit when the playing field starts to level.
Solution – Be sure to elaborate on all elements of your job that closely resemble the responsibilities listed in the posting.  Instead of wasting time filling out applications for jobs that are clearly well out of reach

You are overqualified – The term ‘overqualified’ seems to be overused by rejected applicants today, they want the intermediate level engineer because that is what their budget dictates or they expect that senior engineers would not be challenged by the role (and therefore would leave).  There are also situations where companies will not want to hire you because your experience is indicative that you will only be taking this job until something better comes along.  A CEO applying for a job as a toll collector will not be taken seriously.
Solution – Be sure that your résumé accurately represents your level of skill and experience.  Inflating your credentials or job titles will always work against you.
Conclusion

The time you spend on your job search is valuable, you want to be sure that whoever receives your résumé will get it into the hands of someone who has a similar job to the one you want, not just someone trained to look for buzzwords.  Employees that have similar experience will be the best judges of your fit.  If you aren’t getting the response you want, do not keep using the same methods and expecting a different result.",,False,,False,t3_xrkpv

I graduated from the university with a B.S degree in computer science in December of last year.

My school couldn't offer me any financial aid for the last year and I looked for a job to make up for that. I finally found one with the county

I've been working there for nearly a year an a half now and it's been nearly six months since I graduated. I was expecting a big pay bump when I came out of school with the degree

Here's the major problem. I've politely complained about this a few times and in February

Prior to this, not just waited, I've also applied to every job that I seem suited for. Unfortunately, this seems to have completely backfired on me. I go some weeks getting a call every other day and then other weeks not getting any calls at all. The problem is that almost everyone who calls fits into three camps:

1. Has insane expectations and offers ""senior"" positions that I don't qualify for (I feel recruiters don't even read you resume before calling).
2. Are scammy companies with terrible reviews
3. Only want me to work on contract for 3 - 6 months. These seem scary because your benefits don't start until a certain time and they don't give you enough information on the company.

A lot of time

On top of this, it bothers me that my team is full ""business analysts"" that get paid a lot more than I do and all they do is give me work to do and then take credit for it. I feel completely unmotivated because of this, though I never show it.

Finally. I went back to school and started getting an M.S in computer science. Again, I don't really have time to do any side projects (or much of anything, for that matter) that might get me more exposure.

So anyway


1. What company can I come to get an entry level developer job? Is there any particular company that is a good launching point?
2. What do I have to do to get company to notice me? Should I focus on the M.S or side projects?
3. Will my resume be judged more harshly because I work for the county? I personally feel like everyone who works here is just here because they have seniority and because it's safe
4. What's the best plan of attack to get out of my current situation?
5. Should I take contracting/contract to hire jobs?

**TL;DR**
1. I am a recent computer science graduate.

2. I have 1.5 years of web development experience working terrible and incredibly low paying job for my county/local government.

3. I can't find a decent job on my own (I have been applying to everything I can) and I feel recruiters are really bad at matching me to other positions. I feel like they don't even read my resume at all.

4. I'm not sure if finishing my M.S in CS or doing side projects is the better option for getting attention from companies.

A recent Hacker News post by a man named Andrew was voted to the front page and received over 50 comments (as of my post).  The post was called [Ask HN:  Would you hire me?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5704127)

He provided the following details about himself:

* 28 years old with a Finance Degree from a non-Ivy league school
* Spent the last two years living overseas teaching English and learning to code
* Fairly well versed in html, and PHP
He also included links to his:

* GitHub – handful of repos
* Stack Overflow profile – 521 reputation
* Blog – Attractive UI

Andrew received a fair amount of positive feedback, yet a highly technical audience were either mostly positive and at worst neutral on hiring (considering is more accurate) this potential applicant.  Only a couple responders mentioned looking at the one project he listed, and none referenced the quality of his code samples on his blog or GitHub, so we might assume that no one even bothered to look at his code.  Interesting.

Part of the explanation for the positive response is undoubtedly the makeup of the Hacker News crowd

I admit, which are mostly startup and early stage software companies, are more representative of the HN crowd (at least in terms of evaluating engineers) than most larger companies.  And even if I did not have a great opportunity for him today, I would think that a few years down the road he will be someone that I’d want to represent.

What is it about this candidate with no experience and no highly relevant education that gets our attention?  Of the details we have about Andrew

When evaluating talent and the decision whether or not to interview a candidate for a software job

*Let’s break it down.*

* **28 years old with a Finance Degree from a non-Ivy league school** - Most readers, and if he had listed his specific school that would have had an impact.  Although most might be reluctant to mention it, the age demographic is probably a positive based on the industry, as he obviously has some life experience and maturity but will not fall prey to any old dog/new tricks bias.

* **Spent the last two years living overseas teaching English and learning to code** – Teaching any subject to any students is valuable experience for almost any profession

* **Fairly well versed in html, and PHP.  Just getting started with Ruby** - His claim of being ‘well versed’ is only a self-assessment, but that could be at least somewhat validated (or invalidated) by anyone taking a look at his blog’s source or GitHub account.  This at least indicates that he is learning technologies that will give him some marketability based on demand for these skills.  We may question Andrew’s choices if he were learning a less popular skill.

* **GitHub, the fact that Andrew has both a GitHub and Stack Overflow account is probably more of an indicator of possible talent than what is actually in the accounts.  Most candidates in my experience don’t have a GitHub/Bitbucket or SO account, but those who do have accounts are historically more successful with my clients than those who don’t.  The attractive blog and few technical posts are yet another indicator, showing some passion as well as the ability to articulate his ideas in writing.

**What other details may have led to the decision of HN readers or people like me who would at least want to speak to Andrew?**

* **He reads Hacker News** – Even if he isn’t a senior developer

* **He comes across as modest and doesn’t appear to feel entitled** - You don’t see anywhere in Andrew’s post a reference to how awesome he is or how he is ‘kicking CSS’s ass on a daily basis’.  His responses to feedback are very positive, and on the contrary he comes across as someone who knows he has to earn it.  Perhaps that is a function of his lack of a CS degree, but either way he appears to be taking the right approach.

* **He’s already creating product** – Although he is only early on in his tech studies, but the desire to produce and distribute a tool is something that perhaps can’t be taught.

**Note:**  Other indicators I use regularly include:

* Past employers – Some companies frankly have a higher standard of hiring
* Technical hobbies – Arduino
* Speaking or writing – Presentations and publications are usually strong indicators
* Tool choice – What blogging platform or operating system you run at home
* User group and meetup – Shows interest and passion

**Conclusion**:  Hiring managers and recruiters are making quick decisions to interview and consider candidates, and highlight details such as independent product development.

Of course, have a GitHub and Stack Overflow account and a blog that covers technology (and I even run one of the best Java Users’ Groups in the world) – but I don’t write code.  Readers of HN should not hire me.

1360872269.0,18j8vn,A look back at my nine years as a professional web developer,your_perception,45,5,27,"This is part rant and warning for those who are new in the web dev industry. I made (what I think are) a lot career mistakes and want to share some of them. There are obviously many finer details left out. The point of this is to share and maybe someone out there can get some benefit from reading. This is NOT a career guide

And some context: I'm a 28 year old male in NYC.

Year 0

I started doing web programming for pay before I graduated college as a part time freelancer. Since I was still green it involved mostly simple layouts/css/php with visual design work. Pay averaged around $12-15 an hour. It was ok but hours were very limited.

Once I graduated I gave a shot at full time freelancing. I grossly underestimated projects. Wasted a lot of time travelling, but I stayed up to date with the world of web dev. I barely had any decent portfolio to show either.


Year 3

My first full time job after college was with a graphic design studio. Originally scoped to be WordPress/Drupal. I thought working in a graphic design studio would be great since that was my other competency. Nope. I was essentially producing sites based on spec with little say in technical decisions. To be fair the small size of most of the clients didn’t have much room for hosting and ops in their budget. I started at a paltry $45k with some benefits.

At this time I started picking up Python and learned more of the other aspects in web development. I feel this was the beginning of my transition from developer to engineer. I wanted to solve technical problems, mongo, heck... ANYTHING else. It was LAMP because dreamhost is cheap and so easily available. If the Principal of the company didn’t know of the other solutions, it didn’t exist! I have tried multiple times to objectively promote other platforms and approached to no avail.

The positive is this did give me much better exposure to working in a structured project: deadlines, proposals, etc. The end results were of high quality, and a few rare projects allowed me to make e-commerce sites and use popular APIs.

I stayed there for five years. I ended the job making around $57k. This is probably my biggest mistake in my career advancement. I just got complacent and lazy. I should’ve stayed about three years tops.

Year 8

WOO! Startup! Making $75k and living the stereotypical startup lifestyle. Not as much as I would have hoped to make but I was so sour of the previous job. If I had taken the time to improve my own technical skills I would have landed a higher paying job

Strangely enough the main product I was working on is still on the LAMP stack (ugh) but I get much more say in technical decisions and any and every prototype in any platform is welcome. Other perks included working any hours as long as the work gets done, and telecommuting.

Everything was pretty sweet but I’ll admit working in LAMP still sucked. I saw ads of Node, etc. And I’m still here constantly going back to php.net because I can never remember the needle/haystack parameter ordering.


Year 9 (today)

I left the startup on good terms and I knew my next job would make me more money. I was getting interest from companies offering $90k minimum (20% increase).

But it’s still LAMP.

One thing I’m starting to notice is if money is what you want to go for, and Java and go for the companies with deep pockets.

This next paragraph is just a guess based on my observation: if you want to go for the startups with deep pockets (due to huge venture investments) start and keep up with the trends. If I picked up RoR and accepted a junior level job three years into my first full time job, 2. the next big thing can more or less be combined with the existing product nicely.

As for me right now I passed on the 20% (minimum) wage increase to try at my own PaaS company.",,t5_2sdpm,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/18j8vn/a_look_back_at_my_nine_years_as_a_professional/

I’m 35, and it evolved into a “senior” position where I now make a modest living still building web apps.  

They trusted me to be the lead on pretty much every project, when someone left, their responsibilities were doled out to those who stayed, or taught to new hire fresh faced, right out of school.    They don’t like to pay the big bucks for “real” talent.  My boss?  He’s a basically a tech savvy salesman with no programming knowledge.  That’s great for my job security but not my career.

They ride us.  Hard.   Especially as deadlines get closer.  Long days

At the beginning, etc.).  But eventually that shiny new car became just a car.  Driving became less about fun and more about sitting in traffic and dealing with idiots.   I stopped learning new things because I didn’t need to.  The younger programmers took my old job of improving existing code.  I got to do “new” things, which I thought would be great, but it’s all in the same languages I’ve been using, so I got nothing out of it -- other than my  paycheck at the end of the week.   I tried to pick up new things outside of work, but I just couldn’t do it well.   Part of it is from being burnt out mentally from the day job, and the other part from not having anything to grow towards.

So the last few years have been a cycle of being silently disgruntled, I’ve been more adamant about leaving -- if I can find a job.

I look around and see brilliant websites, etc and the new technologies that drive them.  And here I am using .NET 3.5 and SQL 2008 to build yet another business tool or report.  I miss having my work under the public eye.  (more on that later)  I want to leave.

But my job experience is so fragmented -- bouncing from project to project, say,  .NET for much of these 10  years, but I feel like I got max 3 years of real experience out of it and learned nothing the other 7.    So, I feel like I’m not equipped to take jobs that ask for 5+ years, and in the few job interviews I’ve taken lately, my feelings have been justified even if they don’t say it to my face.

Many places ask for “team leaders” but despite being a “senior” programmer

I should also mention that I have a mortgage (barely above water, and hopefully a kid or two in the near future.  I recognize that I’m just digging myself deeper, if I stay where I am.  So I interview where I can, with hope that I can land another  job that where I can grow again.  But the pay offered is consistently less (up to $15K less) than what I’m earning now.

Freelancing would be my dream job.  In fact, and I have little to show for my last decade of work (thanks NDA’s).  Besides, I feel like I’m well behind the curve in this era of “responsive design,” mobile browsing, and cloud programming, since I spent  the better part of a decade writing web apps for offices not the general public.

So my current thinking is to just take the first offer that makes me happy even if it pays less.  Take the rejuvenation I get from that job to fuel a freelancing gig on the side to cover the difference.  Forget about buying a new car (current car is 10 years

It’s financially risky

I guess what I am searching for from this /r/ is some validation or advice to my career path.

I need some advice

I have a wife, a full-time job, and go to school full-time. On top of all that, the wife is also going back to school, but while working part-time. We are still in the process of figuring out if this is even feasible. We both want to pull ourselves up by our bootstraps, but it's not easy to say the least.

I'm currently going to TCCD (in the DFW area in Texas) and doing their Associates of Arts transfer degree.

One question would be

Internships have been on my mind a lot lately because of how important people say they are to finding a job. The thing is, I have been working for my current company over 5 years now (yay more vacation); so I rather not have to quit just to pursue internship experience. However, I'm definitely willing to do it if it's worth it. I should note though, I have done some technical writing for this company and it looks like there is going to be more opportunities to get more experience doing just that. Seems like there are plenty of little programming/scripting projects I can do on the side (that I dreamed up) to help the company out. I don't really know how good that would look on a resume because in the end it is very unlikely my job title or main duty is going to change.

I am aware of how important it is to get involved in an open source project on github or wherever. And this is another main thing I worry about all the time is not having enough time to really do stuff on the side. For example

Any kind of general advice that you guys have is greatly appreciated.

1355324139.0,14q69z,Am I an unreasonable interviewer?,dev91throwaway,45,7,137,"Apparently I've become labeled as the code bigot or algorithms curmudgeon at my office because of my desire to see candidates display a modicum of basic skills in their interviews. I don't think what I'm asking for is unreasonable


The other day, who was seeking a leadership position in the company. This candidate said they were used to mentoring other devs and usually being in a leadership position. I explained that while that's all good and fine, we do expect to get our hands dirty; we're quite a small company, and was told that they'd have no problems doing so. I decided to lead off with (what I thought was) a simple algorithms question:


Given an arbitrary string, and that once bested we could go on to other, more interesting questions. Boy was I wrong. Candidate spent 10 minutes getting pretty much nowhere. Their first tack was to use LINQ to get the answer, which already raised a red flag with me. I kept dropping hints left and right, and they kept looking for some API function in the string class that would find them the answer (which I wouldn't accept anyways; not the point of the exercise). 10 minutes in and I haven't even heard the naive O(n^2) solution yet (which would have at least given me an indication of some basic problem solving skills), and my time was up and I had to leave. EDIT: To be fair, this candidate was quite enthusiastic about development and new technologies, but not enough IMHO.


Fast forward to the post-mortem, but when I interview someone, I interview what they're representing. If you're seeking a leadership position where you mentor developers (on what? How to ""feel good"" about your user stories?) I will call you out on it. I've phone screened 3 javascript devs in the past week who have rated themselves a 7 out of 10 or higher in their knowledge of Javascript, but couldn't explain to me the difference between == and ===. Actually, let me rephrase that: they would give me the textbook answer of ""one checks value and one checks value and type,"" but when questioned on what that means they couldn't come up with an explanation of how the runtime coerces values, and when asked what '1' == 1 and '1' === 1 would evaluate to, one candidate said they evaluate to the same thing (?!) and another said ""nobody writes such things in real life."" Am I too harsh or critical for thinking that a self proclaimed ""7"" could produce a simple answer showcasing their understanding of a symbol they probably use every day? Is it foolish for me to assume that someone who claims such familiarity with a language and works with it everyday should actually understand what they're doing with it?


To top it off, and at least for the front end side of things, engineering is not something that's high on the priority list. He points to a sister site that was coded up in such a way, and how we haven't needed to make updates to it in 2 years, as a gleaming example of this logic. I wonder, how many updates weren't made because nobody wanted to touch that site? It's easy to point to something that's not oft-updated and use that as an argument for ""quick 'n dirty dev,"" but I feel it's fallacious because most products a company develops will be touched/updated regularly.


IMHO, is only the first step in programming. Step 2 is to make it efficient. And step 3 is to make it maintainable. The CEO, although an extremely intelligent individual, doesn't seem to realize just how much the technical debt that's accrued in the system slows down the development team, and how that happens on a daily basis. He seems to maintain the viewpoint that ""if it works, it's good,"" and I think this is the type of thinking that pervades people who are not in our line of business


I did finally get him to concede that we need strong engineers on the backend and server side, the codebase has remained alive and the site has been up 24/7 since then. What he fails to mention are the numerous bugs reports that appear on almost a daily basis, how the rest of the dev team finds incorrect and convoluted logic on a daily basis, and how this slows down development of features, quite often dramatically. Throwing more bodies at the problem seems like a seductive argument, but according to Brooks (Mythical Man Month) it's not a reality, and at some point having too many cooks in the kitchen makes things even messier.

How to get a job in the IT industry

	Resume
		Make your resume look really sharp. Put all relevant experience
		Do NOT use the same resume for every job; tailer your resume to each job. Cover sheets help too.
		It is -OKAY- to put things you've only touched a little bit. Don't lie
		is okay to stretch the truth a little bit. You can always 'fake it til you make it'.
		
	LinkedIn
		Create a LinkedIn account if you haven't and put all relevant information on it.
		Connect with everyone you've worked with on LinkedIn. Connect with any current co-workers
		and actively connect with recruiters.
		
	Recruiters
		Me: ""Believe it or not
		you have to do is give them your resume
		actively hunt for a job for you.""
		
		You: ""Yeah Scott
		
		Me: ""The catch is that the company that recruited you gets a cut. If you make $50/hr at your new job
		your employer will be billed at something around $85/hr
		This doesn't affect what you make
		
		Also,
		but the plans are usually reasonable.""

		I've personally worked with these two:
			Signature				http://www.sigconsult.com/
			Apex					http://apexsystemsinc.com/
		
		I've had friends use these three:

			Robert Half				http://roberthalf.com/
			Volt					http://www.volt.com/
			
			
		Different Types of Contracting:
			
			Full-Time/Direct Hire:
				You start off full-time at the company and the recruiter gets a large sum of money
				from the company up-front. This is very rare
				
			Short-Term Contract (1m-6m):
				You're a contractor
				contracts
				positions. Raise your normal rate 15%+.
				
			Contract (6m-18m):
				You're a contractor for an extended time. There is usually a decent chance to go full-time
				at these positions
				stability.
				
			Contract-to-hire (c2hire):
				You're a contractor who is on the fast-track to get hired at the company. The company wants
				to 'try you out' for a while (usually 90 days or so) to see if you're worth hiring. Beware
				of some recruiters who will lie about the job being c2hire when it is only a regular contract.
				Once you go full-time
				benefits.
				
			Independent Contractor:
				You're an independent contractor who doesn't use a recruiting company. This is very hard to
				do as most large companies only want to use reputable recruiting companies.
				
		Random Advice:
			Beware burning bridges with a recruiting company. There are a handful of really large recruiting
			companies

I arrived onsite and parked in the first spot I saw because I was so nervous despite it not being a visitors spot. I then presented myself at the front desk and waited for my recruiter

Interview 1
-----------
Very positive experience asked an interesting question which I got through pretty quickly and then was asked to improve performance on one piece of it. This took me a while but I eventually figured it out. Interview told me he was ""very impressed"" so naturally I felt great about this one. Most personable interviewer of the day.


Interview 2
-----------
Second guy was very much in line with the kind of person you probably envision when you think of a Google software engineer

Lunch Break
------------
Brought to lunch by a nice guy who was an industry vet but relatively new to Google. He contrasted his ex-employeer with Google and I learned a ton about how the company works. He also made me feel that

Interview 3
-------------
After lunch I have to admit I was starting to get pretty exhausted. The interview asked me a question that wasn't too hard but for some reason I started coding in C and then switched to Java so that was a bit strange. He then asked me some sublties about my solution, for whatever reason I was pretty much stumped on this one I think I did a good job of coming up with a naive solution and talking through the various factors as I attempted to solve the problem. Whenever I came up with an idea I would point out the flaws and try to improve. Eventually I came up with the general idea of the ""good"" solution on my own but we ran out of time before I could develop it further or implement it in code. This was definitely my most difficult interview I think that the guy was either impressed of how I worked through the problem and tried to solve it or else thought I was way too slow and not even close to Google caliber. Complete question mark here.

Interview 4
------------
Nice guy,testing and complexity and he was pretty happy and had plenty of time to spare. Instead of asking another we just had a conversation that continued into the parking lot as he walked me out. 

I left feeling really like I have a chance but have since been analyzing it and go back and forth. Did I impress people or did I merely show that I am somewhat competent but slow and maybe a little all over the place? At least I am pretty sure I didn't bomb and think there is a slight slight chance I could get an offer.

1368032462.0,1dxwd5,Why the Recruiter Didn't Call You Back,fecak,41,9,16,"Original [here](http://jobtipsforgeeks.com/2013/05/08/call/)

Technology pros often express their venom for both the overly-aggressive spamming recruiter and the recruiter that doesn’t call back.  However

Whether it is a lack of response to an application to a job posting or the absence of feedback after an interview, and often rightfully voice their displeasure about being left in the dark.  It seems like a fairly minor expectation to assume that a recruiter will have both the decency and the 30 seconds required to at least send a quick email to let an applicant know that the resume doesn’t show the desired skills, or to inform an interviewee that he/she was not selected for hire.  Candidates who take the time to interview have a right to know if they were not chosen, and hopefully will be given at least some explanation.  Yet, based on the volume of complaints, it seems few recruiters extend this minimal courtesy.

After 15 years in the business, or post-interview performance tips.  Delivering the bad news about a potentially life-changing job offer is not an enviable task, and I can understand why junior level recruiters might be less comfortable in those calls.  Once a recruiter makes several notifications, he/she should hopefully learn that it is best to try and extract at least one lesson for the candidate to take away for next time.  Being a recruiter can require equal parts salesman, psychologist, and career coach on any given day.

Keep in mind that the only true benefit a recruiter receives by making these notifications is goodwill and reputation points with candidates

**So why are recruiters not responding to your applications or resume

**No response for an application or resume submission**

* **Your approach made you seem like an arrogant jerk** - Most applicants are professional and mention their qualifications or skills with some level of humility and maturity.  Confidence is a rare asset in the software business

* **You were grossly unqualified** - Sadly, but there must be a few.  Although I always try to contact all partially qualified applicants, anyone with no relevant professional or academic background will not get a reply.

* **You appeared qualified, is all about playing the odds.  If there are a number of candidates for a position, some will stand out as the most likely to be hired while other applications may contain strong indicators of a much lower hiring possibility.  Any perceived obstacles to hire or details that would make a hire less likely, such as unreasonable salary expectations, unclear work authorization or employment history, or a candidate’s mention of multiple current job offers could prevent a recruiter from responding.  Unfortunately, the most qualified candidate can also be the least likely hire based on these external forces.   I suspect many of those that criticize recruiters fall into this category

* **Location** –   If the recruiter’s client is in the middle of nowhere and an applicant claims to be open to opportunities worldwide, as the likelihood of a candidate’s move is typically low if any local employment options are available.  Likewise, if the candidate’s address indicates a long commute, recruiters may be less apt to respond.  Candidates are usually very willing to relocate for very unique once-in-a-lifetime opportunities, but most jobs don’t fall into that category.

* **The volume of applicants made notification impossible** –  Internal corporate recruiters are probably more likely to get an overwhelming response than their agency counterparts

* **Your application contained a sloppy introduction or résumé** - When an applicant cuts and pastes their introduction (today’s cover letter) and neglects to include the proper company name

* **The job has been filled** – One would hope a recruiter could quickly inform a job seeker that a position is no longer available

**No response after an interview**

* **The recruiter has no news to give you** – Just as recruiters may feel they have little to gain by further contact with rejected candidates, or management shakeups that could negatively impact their ability to get new hires on board.  If the post-interview decision is a definite ‘no’, recruiters should find out quickly and be willing to share that news with candidates, but based on anecdotes it seems many recruiters completely ignore requests for feedback from rejected candidates.

* **The recruiter is waiting for the right moment (that may never come)** - If an agency recruiter has multiple candidates interviewing for one position, you are actually my client’s third choice for the role, but our first choice is dragging her feet on accepting the offer, so just hang tight.”  Hopefully your recruiter will provide at least some degree of transparency and insight, but don’t expect that from most.

* **Your poor interview performance damaged the recruiter’s relationship with the client company** - This is thankfully quite rare

* **You didn’t follow-up or ask for feedback** – Do not expect that a recruiter will contact you independently and unsolicited with interview feedback.  Recruiters with a booming business may be relying on either your request for feedback or the incoming call/email from the client as a  workflow prompt to notify you (I rely on this prompt often)

**Short history:** In the process of getting my Master's degree in CS, .NET 2.0, MSSQL, jQuery, etc...). I still think coding in C# is a wondrous experience and it's IDE Visual Studio is a dream to work with, but I can't shake the feeling that Microsoft can't make up its mind about what it wants to do. The image I associate with them at the moment is a parent-like figure trying to fit in with the circle of friends of their sons and daughters, making a fool out of themselves in the process. It's gotten me conflicted about what career path to pursue. More specific: I don't want to end up with the programming language equivalent of a steam-engine in a year or two when the new shiny Relearn-Everything-Again-Language (now for real!) surfaces.

**The situation:** This only started some months ago, I've also stumbled upon quite a lot of critics and articles that paint a more gloomy picture of the future of said language concept/framework. 

To add insult to injury

* **Windows Phone 7**:  I haven't even seen one in the wild (in my daily life) and I don't want to use hyperbole here, but I do see Androids and IPhones all over the place. DOA?

* **Silverlight**: In my opinion, but provided an answer to a problem that didn't exist in the first place. It failed, but Microsoft anounced that HTML5 will save the day. I can only wonder about what circle of hell these rather comfy programmers awaits, coming from a strong-typed, debugger-friendly language into the boiling pit of lava that is browser incompatibilities and hunting for AJAX/JS bugs through Firebug, spending your day hacking CSS until your fingers bleed and finding new and innovative ways to crash the server. Statements like that make me wonder whether the PR department is in charge of taking the decisions in Redmond or whether they're so dense and so far removed from reality that they believe their own marketing ploys, using doublespeak and ambiguity to not underline the way they've not beaten the best in the industry on a whole range of subjects.

* **Surface**: While still an emerging technology, except for being an eye-catcher at some fancy event. At this point, I don't see it replace any regular counters/bar tables/office equipment anytime soon. Touch and multi-touch certainly have their uses, but to expect everyone to just buy a Surface and ... do what? UX certainly is important, but why point your arrows at such a niche market?

Last thing I heard was that their event called MIX is cancelled for 2012, I'd rather not learn it, but rather spend my time on something I can truly specialize in instead. I just hope I didn't wast my time with WPF. Perhaps I should go back to C++/Java?

Mobile development seems nice, I have no idea of the demand in that sector and don't see myself come up with a new app every week, furthermore I don't know how long it would take me before it becomes profitable.

I'd like to share a response to a similar question I posed to my professor

&gt;I would say that the most important thing to be one of the top tier developers would be flexibility. See the techniques used in different area of Computer Science - Operating Systems, AI, Programming Languages, Web Development - and even from other disciplines - Mathematics, Analysis, Physics, any Engineering discipline

&gt;Let's say you have the opportunity to help develop a control system for a telescope. Don't think about what you don't know about controlling telescopes. Remember that you do know things about developing software that the telescope people don't. After the control system is done, scientists, business people, etc - are generally lousy developers, but that can muddle through and get things that work, eventually. They love it when you give them good tools.]

&gt;Learn to communicate. The most important language you'll use is English. I'm sure you heard me say that many times. Volunteer to work on proposals and business development activities. It sounds boring

1365778387.0,1c7ip4,27 yo computer scientist hating his career - Lost,UnknownToThee,38,8,43,"I am posting this here also from needadvice

I have had a few jobs since graduating in 2011 with a CS degree and haven't ever been able to find any happiness in my career choice. It might be premature because I am so young

My last job gave me $55k starting out, or work that I had no idea how to do since I was new and everyone else was too busy to try and work with me on it. It was 90% of the work was with 10% of the people because, you guessed it, horrible management. I now work with a couple of old friends who I have known for over a decade and, when described, sounds like the best job a programmer could ever get.
I basically get no emails or phone calls. There are 3 of us down here, along with a few other clients. I come in and basically am given work as the day goes by. Sometimes I get something that takes a while to complete, sometimes there are 4 or 5 tasks that take about 5 mins each to complete. A lot of times I sit around pondering why I hate what I do or waste time on this website and others. The thing that made this all come down yesterday was that he asked me to get a new project started using MVC and set it up with twitter bootstrap. I have tried to learn MVC in the past but didn't really have much success and sort of took a hit to my pride. Well, trying again just to play around with it, I realized that I still had no idea what I was looking at or what I needed to do to get going, and I just felt no motivation to even try to learn it (probably because I have been depressed the past 2 weeks).

I thought just a couple of weeks ago this all was stemming from my girlfriend's job because she works odd hours and I don't see her very much
I get into these cycles of hating my job, but I don't have a clue what I would change to. I feel that if I didn't do programming, got a job somewhere else, I would make a lot less money and not be able to afford it. I feel like if I went back to school, I definitely wouldn't be able to afford it and, anyways, I don't even want to go back to school right now. I have too much debt from the first go around and what if I paid for another degree that I wouldn't like any more than what I have. I feel like I want to move, I don't sleep real well

So I am asking for some guidance since I don't know where else to turn really. However, and honestly am not sure if any of those things that I said I feel like I need are the answers. But something has to give and I don't know what that is.

I have heard that maybe reading [this book](http://www.amazon.com/Do-What-You-Are-Personality/dp/0316167266) is a good starting point. I might go get it today.
I am sure I am not the only one that has these issues ( I have been scouring the CS subs and this sub and see it as well). Am I just burnt out? How could that be if I only have been doing this legitimately for just over a year?

tl;dr: 27 yo who hates his career currently. no idea on where to turn or what to change. looking for someone or people to relate to who have had this bump in their life.

It has been a long and bumpy road. I started my career working as a Java developer back in the early 2000s after I got my BSCS in the Bay Area. Got laid off after working there for 2 years during the dot com boom and couldn't find another job. Ended up working as an IT guy for the Army for 7 years. I knew I wanted to go back to the software field after the Army so I busted my ass and studied for a MSCS while I was working for the Army and was deployed all over the world. 

I just came back to the bay area a little over a year ago and was trying to get back to the software field but the gap in my career history didn't help at all. I had interviews from companies of all sizes (including Google

I kept updating my resume and posted it on Dice, and a few other job sites. I also kept up with my Java skills by doing coding challenges. A few weeks ago I got a call from a recruiter about a Java developer opportunity. She set me up for a phone interview and 2 face-to-face interviews and I got an offer today. The only down side is, because I have such a huge gap in software job experience, I am getting paid as an entry level engineer. I didn't mind.

1345835373.0,yrooc,'Overqualified' is overdiagnosed,fecak,36,5,2,"I’ve been inspired by comments on prior articles to discuss the sensitive topics of ‘overqualification’ and ageism.  My [Why You Didn’t Get The Job](http://jobtipsforgeeks.com/2012/06/20/why-you-didnt-get-the-job/) and [Why You Didn’t Get The Interview](http://jobtipsforgeeks.com/2012/08/06/why-you-didnt-get-the-interview/) posts were republished on a few sites, and  claims of alleged ageism are often something else entirely.
Before we begin, I’m over 40.

By saying you are overqualified for jobs

SPOUSE:  How did the interview go?
JOB SEEKER:  I didn’t get the job.
SPOUSE 1:  Oh
JOB SEEKER:  Unfortunately

Of course rejection hurts

Think about this scenario for a second.  You are trying to hire a software developer and you estimate that someone with say five years of experience should be able to handle the duties effectively.  A candidate is presented with fifteen years of experience that has all the attributes you are seeking.  This person should theoretically perform the tasks quicker and even take on some additional workload.  Do you really think a company would not hire this person simply because he/she has those additional years of experience?  I would argue that is rarely the case.

Question:  Is ‘overqualified’ a code word used by managers/HR to mean other things?
Answer:  ALMOST ALWAYS

What can overqualified actually mean?
listed in order from most likely to least likely

* Overpaid/over budget – If your experience &gt; what is required, then hire that same person because of a lack of less experienced quality talent.
* Stagnant – Candidates who have worked for many years as a developer in a technically stagnant and regulated environment will often not thrive in less regulated, is that you can’t release the zoo lions back into the jungle once they’ve been tamed.
* ‘Overskilled’ - If your skills &gt; what is necessary for the job
* Threatening – If your experience &gt; those conducting the interviews, but I genuinely believe it is prevalent enough to mention.
* Too old – Ageism is a real problem, it is relevance.

Some of the best and most accomplished/successful software engineering professionals that I know are over 50

If you are an active job seeker that is continuously hearing that you are overqualified

* Rethink – Try to investigate which of the meanings of overqualified you are hearing most often.  Is your compensation in line with what companies are paying for your set of qualifications?  Do you present yourself in interviews as someone who may become easily bored when your work is less challenging?  Are you making it clear in interviews that you want the job
* Retool – Make sure your skills are relevant and being sought by companies.  Invest time to learn an emerging technology or developing some niche specialty that isn’t already flooded.
* Remarket – Write down the top reasons you think a company should hire you, cover letters).  Find out what was effective for your peers in their job search and try to implement new self-promotion tactics.
* Reboot and refresh – Take a new look at your options beyond the traditional career paths.  Have you considered consulting or contracting roles where your guidance and mentoring skills could be justified and valued for temporary periods?  Are there emerging markets that interest you?

Terms like ‘overqualified’ and ‘not a fit’ are unfortunately the laziest, and they almost always mean something else.   Discovering the real reason you were passed up is necessary to make the proper adjustments so you can get less rejections and more offers.",,False,,t5_2sdpm,False,,

Do I just need to write more free/open software that I can share with the world?  Am I overthinking or overestimating the amount that people care about an active GitHub repository?

I don't have any sort of programming blog either.  Is that somewhere that I could show off my projects without releasing the code?  Would potential employers like to see something like that if I can't or would prefer not to share the source code publicly?

The posted question brings up a few topics for thought, as well as what is wrong with the answers provided.  Then we will dig a bit deeper into the “I don’t know” problem and reveal the motivations behind technical interview questions and why a simple “I don’t know” (which was recommended by one respondent) is almost never appropriate.

**Recovery From A Botched Interview Question

The answer in the forum accepted as the best suggested that it was not recommended to send a correct response as it may make the candidate appear ‘obsessive’

If the candidate sends a note resembling “I just HAD to get this off my chest, if the correct answer is provided tactfully using some careful language, the result should be more indicative of tangible interest in the job than an obsession to be correct.

The mention that the candidate could have researched the answer afterwards is probably irrelevant unless the question was a complete softball that any industry professional must know.  If the question was difficult or perhaps a complex programming exercise in an environment approximate to what the engineer would encounter in the real world

**How To Make The Recovery**

* Email the interviewer and lead with a standard thank you sentiment.
* If there were any legitimate mitigating circumstances that negatively affected your performance
* Write out the question as best you remember with a synopsis of the answer you provided.
* Provide the correct answer and dive a little deeper into your knowledge of the subject.  Be careful not to go too deep (which could risk the obsessive tag mentioned earlier).
* Close by reiterating your interest in the position and your willingness to be tested again with either another interview or some exercise (programming task

If code is appropriate as part of the answer

**Plain “I Dunno” Answers**

One of the participants in the thread added

&gt; “…’I don’t know’ is a safe answer as many places use negative marking for wrong answers.”

Partial credit for that

**Category 1**- Questions you find difficult
**Category 2** - Questions regarding incredibly minute and trivial details that you could possibly know
**Category 3** - Questions about a subject that you have absolutely no exposure to and couldn’t possibly be expected to know outright.

**Motivations Behind The Three Types of Questions**

Category 1 questions are fair and the only motivation is to discover what you know and what you don’t.  Nothing to see here

Category 2 questions are probably a mix of items that could conceivably fall into Category 1 or Category 3

Category 3 questions along with some Category 2 crossovers are the ones that almost always have a hidden agenda

Category 2 and 3 questions typically are asked for one or more of three reasons.

* To measure your brainpower and memory (mostly Category 2) – Some employers do expect their staff to have an abundance of knowledge readily available without using outside materials.  With the vast amount of resources used by technologists today
* To observe you under duress (both Category 2 and 3) – It can be difficult to simulate various scenarios that happen on a day-to-day basis inside of any particular company.  By asking a difficult or even an impossible question
* To understand your resourcefulness and how you diagnose problems (mostly Category 3) – Questions with no widely known answer are a somewhat effective way to see how a candidate might approach and break down a future real-world problem

^Aside:  A fourth motivation increasingly cited by interviewees is to measure your subservience or your tolerance for and willingness to even try to answer such questions.  There is a large population that feel Fermi problems are useless in evaluating talent

**Better Alternatives to “I dunno”**

A simple “I don’t know” is rarely appropriate.  Try one of these instead.

* “I don’t know x, implying that any learning curve will be less severe.
* “I don’t know x

I had a few requests for follow up to see whether I took the interview

I did decide to take the interview, and we actually do have a couple of friends in CA, so we wouldn't be totally isolated. That being said, I would have had to get a really great offer to want to go, since cost of living would be much higher, plus the general uprooting of a family.

I got passed around to 3 different recruiters before the interview. If anyone from Google is reading this: seriously, they kept switching what team I was to be working with; I understand Google has lots of teams, but it would be nice to have an idea of what I would be working on.

So, and proceeded to drive around. Unfortunately, whether from stress, something I ate, or just bad luck, I got sick. Like, unable to keep anything down, although I don't think it affected too much of my performance.

Monday morning, but I kinda wish I had brought it with me. 

Anyway, don't send the guy that has been bounced around 3 teams in 18 months. It kinda sends the wrong message. He also liked to tell me how I could ask anything and it would never get back to the hiring committee. I mean, he told me this at least a dozen times. It made me suspicious but it's not like I had any particularly weird questions.

In the afternoon I had three more technical interviews. One was late, but at least I did see it.). 

The last interviewer was honestly kind of a jerk. Everyone else was affable and polite - he wasn't even polite to the other Googlers. It really stood out in my mind. Also, and he immediately asked ""what, are you making excuses?"" I mean, come on guy, I can barely talk and you're accusing me of trying to get off the hook?) Last, although I think only 1 of the 6 Googlers that interviewed me was American, this guy was very difficult to understand and I had to ask him to repeat himself several times. 

This interview was much less algorithm based and much more nitpicky. Like ""what does this keyword mean in Java?"" nitpicky. I know you should know language features if you're interviewing, I never run into that situation anyway, it's pretty useless to use the keyword there"". He finished up by asking how I would implement a certain property on a data structure, and then concluded by saying there's a method in the API I could have used anyway. Which strikes me as language trivia that is really not relevant. I figured if I didn't get the offer, it was going to be because of this guy, and I was going to have to work with this guy, I would be happy to not get an offer. Alright

Anyway, and flew home. 

Later, I figured I should double-check since the opportunity presented itself.

Kids, and they would not be references on the basis of those accusations (the accusations were ludicrous btw. My buddy that still works there thinks the team lead believed them because he was jealous I was doing better career-wise than my old team. I didn't think he was that petty, but whatever).

Anyway, and waited.

And Waited.

For two weeks. This is another notoriously annoying part of Google hiring - they take forever to plan things and get back to you. Microsoft

Anyway, when they told me I wasn't getting an offer, it was as if a weight was off my shoulders. I gave Google by best shot, they said it wasn't good enough, and I am quite happy about it. I am sure they will continue to be successful, and I will continue my career in my current company.

Here's what happened:

(wall of text and bitter ranting ahead)

* Worked in scrappy startups for 3 years. Had a lot of solid business ideas and a lot of contacts. Really aspired to strike out on my own
* So got a job with the ""company"", and it was worth it. They noticed the amount of hard work you put in and you got credit for what you did and more than that, financially rewarded for it. I was single at that time, was quite good at what I did. After a while they gave me a lot of responsibilities and rewarded me with promotions. Meanwhile the ""company"" was killing it. I learned a great deal about ""soft"" skills and the industry, while making bank. Everything was great.
* While this was happening, smart beyond my age(or so they said). Pride comes before the fall and what not. 
* After a while I see pencil pushers all around, ought to be replaced with enterprisey stuff(read: bloated J2EE stack), so that they can hire cheap drones off the market. And BTW, this is happening in 2011 when the industry is becoming mobile, html5/nodejs/mongodb are changing the game. The company I loved was becoming something else.
* So I stopped worrying about it, so I opted to work from there. New management was also very keen to get rid of me, as I didn't always agree with them(like we should focus on mobile/html5/node not on J2EE crap), so they readily agreed. At this point I was a team architect(for a 20+ team) and leading a major project/initiative which was in incubation.
* After getting married, maintain the server farm which runs the build etc. Things which really fall under devops category. Now we are not talking about a lean bootstrapped startup, where developers are expected to do such things. This is now a big-ass company with 15 devops guys sitting in just my location. But our management couldn't book any of them in time, because they can't execute for shit.
* While this is dragging on, because things are just settling down with my marriage and also I bought a new home now. So I decided to mellow out, keep quite for an year and look for other opportunities within my company. So, the annual performance ratings come around and I got royally screwed. It is so bad that an inter-company transfer is now out of the question, according to company policy.
* Meanwhile, it was not released to the customers. Also the new tech stack didn't support mobile devices(not a J2EE/JSP deficiency, it was a management decision). This was in 2012. So the management promptly spread the blame to the developers and gave themselves a round of promotions.
* I got absorbed/grabbed in to a new team, so I was asked to work as a developer initially. After spending months with this team, I was quite happy, because now I can work with code after a long break and my teammates were nice people. I just had to deal with the pointy-haired boss and shitty management like everyone else does in the company now. 
* But it's becoming increasingly clear that they really don't need an architect role(which I was supposed to fulfill), not a money-making product). 90% of the work is just for the sake of it, and it's a really terrible codebase. Piss poor test coverage, zero code reviews and just hacks piled on hacks. Refactoring is a dirty word and this management would have none of it. You can't spend time writing unit tests, you need to develop ""features"" that you will throw away in the next iteration. So in some ways, this management is even worse than the previous one.

Am I exaggerating much?

If I have to quit this job

* If I want to stay in my current city
* I took an interview in one of those companies recently. And ""discovered"" this raging hard-on our industry has for data structures/algorithms. Yep, so I really don't understand the need for asking the candidate to write code for rotating a red-black tree. I think the real purpose of these questions is to just set a bar, so that only candidates who actually spend a significant amount of time preparing for the interview can pass. Kind of like, testing if the candidate ""really wants it"". So it scares me to take up a job like that, because I am afraid I will end up in the same old situation -- where you end up washed out and working yourself to the bones.
* It increasingly looks like now or never, partly because of my recent migration. 
* I will be happy to take a pay cut and work for a lesser salary, meaningful work and management which gets technology. Does that even exist? Most recruiters don't even call me after they see my current pay scale. How do I overcome that?

My core skills are Java, I can pay off the house mortgage and can go on jobless for 6 months or so, thanks to the stock options. After that, I am fucked.

1332884940.0,rghrs,Can you get an internship as a freshman in college: A Guide,LockeWatts,31,6,25,"**Introduction:**  

Hi, to /r/cscareerquestions over the last 6 months or so. As I have just gone through the entire process, I’m here to guide you along the way and answer questions about your wonderful exciting summer of sitting inside for 40 hours a week.  

**The answer (If you just want to know):**  

Possibly

**The Story (My journey towards a summer internship):**  
If you don’t actually want to read about me

I am a freshman at the University of Georgia, GA. Our primary research is in binge drinking, but we’re also known for our biology and medical research, and occasionally something fun in our very small CS department (~200 students). I’m in the Honors program, pursuing a Bachelor’s\Master’s crossover, to get both degrees in four years. (Hooray for 37 hours of AP credit!)  

 I started my search early, Google, Apple, etc. etc.) and found a few promising gems. First, is the [Google Freshman Engineering Practicum]( http://www.google.com/jobs/engpracticum/fep/), which is exactly what it sounds like. A 10 week internship out in Mountain View, CA. Next was  the [Explore Microsoft](http://careers.microsoft.com/careers/en/us/internships-explore-microsoft.aspx) program, WA. Well now I was all excited, we’ll see.  

From there, and uncles to possibly find me internships at their companies, or with the companies of friends. I sat down and crawled through hundreds of job postings on sites like [Dice](http://www.dice.com) and [Monster](http://www.monster.com) looking for internship postings in my area. Don’t look outside your area, unless they’re a big tech company (See above), they won’t pay for you to relocate for the summer.  

I found some decent success through these sites, complete props to a post a few months ago that I shamelessly stole this resume format from.  

From there, and your University’s job website. I checked my career fair, and looked for CS companies. Well, we don’t have any. Shit. What about large companies that have big IT departments? Well, there are a fair number of those. So I got in my suit (You MUST wear a suit to a career fair) and went and talked to one or two of them.  

And finally

So first thing, you’ll have to do it again. As a general rule, I checked the University job site once every few days, from October until now. That’s important, because new jobs get submitted as time goes on. I had personally thought the recruiting process started in the fall, but from what I’ve seen it actually picks up in the spring.  

Oh! I just remembered. Here’s something unscrupulous I’ve done. If around where you live has a big tech school that you don’t go to

Okay

- Google  
- Microsoft  
- IBM  
- AT&amp;T  
- HP  
- Chick-Fil-A  
- Home Depot  
- Lockheed Martin  
- ThyssenKrupp IT Services
- Verizon Wireless  
- McKesson Provider Technologies  
- ADP (Automatic Data Processing)  
- Sybase  
- Windham Brannon  
- Macy’s  
- MedAssets  

Don’t be surprised if you don’t recognize every name on the list

- Google: No  
- Microsoft: No  
- IBM: No  
- AT&amp;T: Originally no
- *HP: Phone interview*  
- Chick-Fil-A: No  
- *Home Depot: Phone interview*  
- Lockheed Martin: No  
- *ThyssenKrupp IT Services: Phone interview
- Verizon Wireless: No  
- McKesson: No  
- ADP: No  
- *Sybase: Phone interview*  
- Windham Brannon: No  
- Macy’s: No  
- *MedAssets: Phone interview

So, the rest didn’t even bother), most said that they weren’t interested in a freshman intern. Doesn’t matter my skill set or programming ability, they simply aren’t interested.  

The reason the companies gave me for this is that most companies use their internships as recruitment programs. Nobody is thinking four years down the road as far as hiring new recruits. They want new developers after the summer you work for them. This fucking sucks

Now

As a general note of things that were covered in every interview so I don’t repeat myself:  

*General questions:*  

- Tell me about yourself. – This question sucks. I’m sorry, programmatically, personally…? I’m not really sure what you’re looking for.” Until I realized that they always meant programmatically. Tell them about your programming background. Mine went something like this:  

“Okay, I know that the C stands for “chat”. They generally don’t.), and then from there branched out into basic JavaScript and began being interested in computer security. From there beginning just before high school I branched out into Java and C++ to learn more object oriented programming, and began working on larger projects. Since then I’ve been working on becoming familiar with Python, C#, and Ruby.""  
 
Invariably

- Tell me about a project you’ve worked on in the past that you were particularly excited about doing.  

I’ll be honest right here. I have past projects to draw on. If you don’t, even if it never got out of the design stages, it still shows the level of interest they’re looking for.  

Anyway

This is an important question. Not only will they gauge your programming ability by the depth of the project you worked on

Technical Questions:  

- The definition of inheritance - Every, and then giving an example.  
- The definition of polymorphism – See above  
- Some keyword question (For HP it was C#’s “protected”
- Some kind of database question (How do you sanitize SQL inputs
- Some kind of data structure question. Not the same as above. This would be like

In interviews in general, a grad student, a senior who's about to work at Google or whatever. Find someone, and just talk to them about code. The interview will more or less be no different.  

Surprisingly, but I have to do it for tests too. It’s best to just memorize your basic syntax. The questions I had to do by hand were the following:  

- Here is a 12X12 multiplication table. Write a program to output this table.  
- Modify the program above to work with any size table.  
- Modify the problem above so that if the number is divisible by three, output “buzz”. (This is the classic fizzbuzz problem).  
- Write a program to take in a string and reverse it.  
- Let’s say I have an arbitrarily large linked list. What would you do to check if someone had looped the list back on itself (Pointed one of the pointers to an earlier node).    

All of these except the last one shouldn’t be particularly challenging to a second semester CS student. I was honestly very surprised with how easy the programming challenges were.  

From there, but I’m very pleased with it.  

**Miscellaneous information you might want to know:**

- In my research into internships, and another one I tried to get was $18/hour. So, definitely good money, and scales based on where you live.  

- The big tech companies are the only ones who pay for relocation

- Internships are generally between eight and twelve weeks, due to when their internship block of the summer is. Oh well.

- Creating SSRS reports for scheduling

- Sitting down with Accounts Receivable to figure out a way to streamline the ridiculous amount of data entry they do.

- Going on a witch hunt for a cause for low revenue figures for last month under management's orders.

- Ad hoc data pulls for someone who needs to tell a customer why deadline x isn't going to be met.

- Discussing the details of a ""new"" report which is really just a summary of 3 other reports.

- Explaining to Bob

So I graduated this year from a pretty good public university and had been trying to interview with plenty of big name companies (Goog, FB, Salesforce) currently and in the past (for internships) and I've always come up short on the last interview before they make a decision.

Granted that

This year however, thinking before I code. I spend hours at a time just thinking about **how to think about a problem correctly**.

So I figured I had learned from all my mistakes...in the past, my skills. THIS TIME IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT.

I came up with a method and I practiced this process in my head that seemed perfect to what the interviewers want (in this order):

1) Get clarity!! Don't solve the wrong problem and get rid of any ambiguity!!

2) Write test cases; positive scenarios

3) Make the appropriate sanity checks; **N.E.S.S.** (nulls, size/length check).

4) Will a data structure help? Try a: HashMap, Queue, PriorityQueue, List, array[], Tree, Recursion.

5) Write out the pseudo-code in comments first and then code it. BUT make sure to tell them that you will write code after!!

Whenever I hear feedback like this from clients

INTERVIEWER:  Have you worked with Ruby on Rails before?

CANDIDATE:  Yes

INTERVIEWER:  Could you elaborate on that a little bit?

CANDIDATE:  Yes

INTERVIEWER:  (VISIBLY ANNOYED)


It brings to mind the old joke (which of course reinforces gender and programmer stereotypes):

&gt; A wife asks her computer programmer husband, “Why did you get twelve gallons of milk?” and he responds, “They had eggs.”

In the short two question interview scenario above, this candidate may not feel he/she is being dodgy at all.  Just as the programmer in the joke did what his wife asked (by his literal interpretation).

Let’s now look at a brief example of a police interrogation:

INTERROGATOR:  Where were you on the night of the 8th?

SUSPECT:  At home.

INTERROGATOR:  Were you by yourself?

SUSPECT:  No

INTERROGATOR:  Who was with you?

SUSPECT:  My husband.

INTERROGATOR:  WHO WAS WITH YOU??!!

SUSPECT:  My lover!  (CUE SCARY MUSIC)


These answers provide the minimum amount of information the interrogator requested

**A job interview is not an interrogation**

Keep in mind that interviews, a decision which could greatly impact the life of at least one party (the candidate) or even both parties (if the hire is made).  If an interviewer gives even a small consideration that this stranger may have a family that depends on the income that the job would provide, the potential for an awkward exchange is even more likely.

Most interviewers want to get a dialogue flowing, “Would I want to work next to this person every day for several years?”  If the candidate answered their questions in a fashion resembling the Candidate or the Suspect in the samples above, the answer is always “No”.

Some candidates may argue that they have answered the questions as asked, and it is one reason that chatbots with artificial intelligence may give answers like our Candidate did in the example.

*So, and in the case of software engineers you may hear, “Being that chatty, I can’t imagine what his/her code (comments) looks like!‘

**How do I appear to be open


* Don’t take every question literally – Remember that a good interviewer is trying to engage you in a dialogue and an exchange of ideas.
* Pause before answering – Some candidates seem programmed to immediately start talking after a question is asked
* Pause after answering -  If the interviewer does not respond with a follow-up after a few seconds
*Ask questions to clarify what type of answer is expected – If you are asked a question where there could be both an acceptable short answer (yes/no) or a longer answer (details)
* At the end of the interview

Go into the interview with the goal of having a conversation which should put the interviewer at ease.  Be willing to follow the interviewer into any direction the discussion may take

At first when I received the offer I was really excited to start working at a place like Amazon but after reading through all of the reviews on glassdoor it seems like it might not be the best place to work as far as work life balance

I really enjoyed those two jobs aside from this.

Fast forward to now. I started at a new company about a month and a half ago, and reviews all of our code. He has ZERO tolerance for any of us. We get paid well, but it really feels like emotional abuse sometimes. I've already gotten into verbal fights with him, in which our boss has to act as a peace keeper. He's basically said that I ask too many questions, and I should ""go read a fucking manual"" instead of coming to him for every little problem I have. He often links me to that ""go google it yourself"" site as a response when I ask him stuff over chat. The thing is, I don't come to him *that* often, and when I do it's for stuff that I feel I can't just Google. Its for software he either wrote or production configurations I want to pick his brain about. Or sometimes I want him to just get his opinion on a matter--like do you think it would make sense to use this pattern here? Is there a better way to do this? I ask him this after I've written code.

Now, then returned the value when the last node was examined. This was just to get a sense of what kind of answer he was looking for. He then said that the solution wouldn't scale if the stack was large enough, and to come up with a faster approach.

Now

Here is the problem. I think most employers prefer a guy who is an expert in X if they need a guy for X. They ignore his experience and interest in Y and Z. 

So, I won't be able to compete with a guy who has been doing web development for couple of years. 

On the other hand

I am divided. One of my colleagues that I consulted says it's better to explore new vistas. This will help you adept quickly to new frameworks and languages. This makes sense to me, I will apply at my next job as a Mac developer not as a web developer.

--------------
I will be graduating next year from a CS program from one of the top 5 universities in Canada. Its depressing for me to say that despite having a really good cumulative average in my program, I don't think I'm worth anything and so will not be able to find a job after I graduate.

Let me clarify what I've said above: 
1) While its one of the top 5 universities in the country
2) Yes, does well, and parties the time he's left with. I realize that this habit of mine is possibly one of the bigger reasons or probably THE reason, why I think I'll be a failure after I graduate.
3) The 16 month internship experience I've had with the software firm has been that of a Test Associate intern. This is one of the decisions I regret most in my life until now (I know there are many more to come). I was offered 4 developer position internships and 2 test associate internships. I chose the internship of the testing position because of the money and the name of the software firm. And believe me when I say this, I knew I should go with the developing positions, but should I have gone with them, I wouldn't have been able to finish school.

I believe that internships are the best way to start off your career and a great opportunity for those who can get these. I faltered here big time. 

Now
--------------------------------------------
I'll be graduating in slightly over a year. And I believe that 1 year can be a relatively long period of time to set things right if one really wants to.

But here's my problem

I'm not great with any particular technology. I have had some experience with a few of them. Nothing that would dazzle anyone. I know people without CS degrees have better experiences and work than I do.

Under web development, JS, PHP, SQL. My experience here limited to creating a simple website I made.
Under core development, C++. But my experience here is limited to school assignments extending up to a writing a few classes.
Under app development
Under testing practices

I haven't ever worked with Open Source. Never had experience with GIT and open source projects on github. This, I know. But that's why I need your help..

I have heard and read a lot about TopCoder. Apparently, which obviously isn't guaranteed before hand, will do it for you.

I don't know if I should go about making some kind of web app or a phone app myself and bank on that.

TL;DR
-------
I don't know how I should spend the last year before I graduate to make myself sellable to firms, that doesn't seem to be enough.

Please tell me whether putting all my time in Top Coder can be worth it. Why? 

Or please tell me if I should start contributing to Open Source projects. If so

&gt;**Common Misconceptions**

&gt;That computer science majors make tons of money.  The lesson to be learned here is that compensation is equivalent to work.  Ideally

&gt;Unfortunately, the programming skillset is not the most difficult kind of knowledge, and the market values the true gems of the skillset (documentation, proper style, process specification, etc) far less than the programmer does — out of proportion with the effort required to acquire the skillset.  I hate to say it, but in many ways

&gt;A final misconception I can think of is the “job lifetime”.  Many people thing that computer science majors are worth a lot and always employable.  This is not the case.  More so than other majors, the computer science major's specific programming knowledge is outmoded, and he/she is generally fired for the new hot-shot college CS grad who knows the new languages and technology well, and does *not* know how much he/she is worth.  i.e.  They can be paid less for more.  CS is a really dangerous major to take out large loans on.  You can almost guarantee a few years employment though — maybe not job security, but a good few years in general.

1344883397.0,y5o63,Blind Dating for Geeks:  Questions Candidates Should Ask (and when to ask them) During Interviews,fecak,26,4,0,"After a few ‘Questions Candidates Ask In Interviews’ themed articles appeared in my Twitter stream, there are some nuances that do not apply to other industries.

Why is the timing of when the questions are asked important?  An interview is nothing more than a blind date, say, a serial killer – but leading off with the ‘Are you a serial killer?’ question would seem rude, and we probably wouldn’t get an honest answer anyway.

Below is a list of the best questions to ask in chronological order.  Please keep in mind that you would need to restart from the beginning for every new person that you meet in situations where you meet with multiple participants individually.  You may not be afforded the opportunity to ask all the questions based on time constraints
Setting a positive interview tone
OR
Cocktails and light conversation

Question: “What is your background and how did you come to work for COMPANY?”
Reason to ask it:  Most people genuinely like to talk about themselves (those that do not share this trait will probably not be in the interview)

Question: “What do you like best about your job and about working for COMPANY?”
Reason to ask it: This question serves two purposes. First, what the employee chooses to say they like best can be quite telling. If their answer is ‘environment’, ‘work/life balance’ or ‘the people’, that is a universal positive. If the response is ‘the money’ or ‘vacation time’, you may want to dig deeper to find out why.

BONUS Question:  (If possible
Reason to ask it:  This shows that you have done your homework before the interview and that you want to be taken seriously as a candidate.  This is something that you want to fully research to prevent making a huge mistake that would make recovery impossible.
Discovery
OR
Gentle interrogation of your date during dinner

Question: What are the biggest challenges you face?
Reason to ask it: The reason for using the word ‘challenges’ is that it does not have a negative connotation, limited resources and a fast pace.  Some industries are known for heavy regulation getting in the way of progress.  This is all valuable information.

Question: What would the typical day be like for me at COMPANY?
Reason to ask it: You may get an answer that gives you tangible insight into work/life balance (‘I usually get home in time to watch Jimmy Fallon’), etc.

Question: What was your career path here and what is a typical career path for my role at COMPANY?
Reason to ask it: Find out if they promote from within and if there are separate technical and non-technical/pure management tracks.  Will you be forced into a management role?

Question: How would you describe the environment?
Reason to ask it:  Asking an open-ended question like this could lead in several directions.  You should be able to ascertain if it is cut-throat or cooperative

Question: Management styles? Development processes and methodologies in place?
Reason to ask it:  Engineers preferences for structure vary greatly.  Be sure to drill down to get the best understanding of whether their practices are aligned with your views.

Question: Tech stack?
Reason to ask it: If their answer is a list of products and technologies that are severely dated, perhaps they are making tech decisions based on cool factor more than quality.  Be sure to listen for what can be telling patterns, such as an abundance of tools from a particular vendor or a wide variety of open source tools.  This question also gives you an opening to discuss your experience (and preferences) relevant to their stack.

Question: Why is this position open?
Reason to ask it: Growth or promotion are the two most desirable answers. Perhaps this position is a launching board into higher level positions
Closing the deal
OR
Last call and the drive home)…

Question: What qualities/background do you think would be key to making someone successful in this position?
Reason to ask it: During that last set of questions

Question: What projects are just getting ramped up or are on the horizon?
Reason to ask it: Interviewers will enjoy discussing new endeavors that they think you will find most interesting. If they talk about fixing bugs and maintenance

Question: Where do you see yourself in five years here at COMPANY?
Reason to ask it: This question is generally asked of candidates, and if the interviewer has a sense of humor expect an attempt to use it on this question.
The Conclusion
OR
Goodnight

Question:  Is there anything else I can answer for you or any more information I can provide to help you in your decision?
Reason to ask it:  It shows you are forthcoming and trying to be helpful.

Question:  I am very interested in this opportunity (or similar sentiment).  When do you expect COMPANY might be making a decision?
Reason to ask it:  Showing interest is vital

1374190974.0,1ilh7o,What to do? Technical interview where interviewer stubbornly gets Big-O wrong,TechThrowaway42,23,4,58,"Have you ever been turned down because the interviewer got a Big-O concept wrong but thought *you* were the idiot?

So I was interviewing onsite at an impressive-seeming startup in San Francisco.  I was to be interviewed by five people.  The first two went pretty well.  On the third I was given a word count problem (count all occurrences of each word) and soon came up with this:

    def word_count_time(s):
        words = s.split()  # ""Don't worry about efficiency here""
        out_dict = {}
        for word in words:
            # is_letter(c) assumed to be implemented; filters out punctuation
            cl_word = """".join([c.lower() for c in word if is_letter(c)])
            if cl_word in out_dict:
                out_dict[cl_word] += 1
            else:
                out_dict[cl_word] = 1
        return out_dict

 So far, n being the length of the input string.

That's where it got messy.  He insisted that it must be O( n^2 ) because I have a nested for-loop.  I then asked what he was taking to mean ""n"" here, even if it's iterating within an iteration.  He was adamant, however, that a nested for-loop is necessarily O( n^2 ).  I tried to give reasons why this isn't like typical cases of nested loops, and diagrammed why it only does one (or a constant number of) pass(es) through the string.

After a little more back-and-forth, so I suggested we run the problem with increasing problem size and look at how it scales.  He preferred debate.

Just to verify my sanity, a 10x increase in problem size means a 10x increase in a run time -- not 100x.

    string length    run time (sec)
    4000                    0.01396
    40000                   0.15149
    400000                  1.28775
    4000000                13.00573
    40000000              134.23498

Try it out for yourself: generate random strings of increasing parameter length s to feed to the function below

    LETTERS = ""abcdefghijklmnoprstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ""
    def word_count_time(s):
        words = s.split()
        out_dict = {}
        for word in words:
            cl_word = """".join([c.lower() for c in word if c in LETTERS])
            if cl_word in out_dict:
                out_dict[cl_word] += 1
            else:
                out_dict[cl_word] = 1
        return out_dict

I've been following this thread for a while now and have learned a ton. Thanks so much to everyone who takes the time to answer questions. I really appreciate it.

I recently graduated with a very fulfilling yet very useless bachelors in film. I've realized that film is not the place for me

I was accepted into Oregon State's online post-bacc CS degree. It fits my needs very well because it is intended for people such as myself who have already completed a bachelors (thus no need to re-take GEs that don't transfer), 60 credit) year. I'll come out on the other end with a B.S. in CS.

My family, the masters degree is the golden standard for getting a job. From the research I've done and from what I've seen on this thread, it seems getting a masters in CS is not always a great idea, especially if one didn't get a bachelors in CS. One might miss out on some of the foundational CS courses offered in a BS and be a worse programmer for it. A masters also might be too specialized. It seems from what I've read that, contrary to fields in the humanities, a bachelors in CS is usually the standard in this field.

I've also considered self-teaching instead of a bachelors, although not all, only hire people who have a bachelors in CS, and the bachelors should help open doors for the career search.

One potential downside to the program I'm entering is that because it is completed in 1 intensive year (4 quarters, and even while I'm studying, I'll be living in a smaller town that doesn't have CS internship opportunities. I've read that completing a side project independently, putting my code on github, and possibly working for open source projects is a good way to offset the disadvantage of not having completed an internship, although maybe that's not a feasible alternative in some people's eyes. I do have to say that I am a very hard worker who is used to putting in many more hours than is necessary for class into side projects, which is what I did during my bachelors. Another potential downside to my program is that it is an online program

So, would a post-bacc second bachelors or a masters be preferable for my situation? Would the online and internship-less nature of my degree be too much of a disadvantage?

I obviously want to ensure my future success by laying the foundations of my education properly. And I also want to be able to argue cogently to my family why I am making the best possible choice for my future, they are footing the bill!

*This blog post was inspired by a reader in this sub who asked me this morning for a referral to recruiters in his geographic area.*

You would need to be blind not to notice that tech recruiting firms are now tending to hire young and attractive female rookie recruiters, which is probably best described as smug.


Since I started blogging I have been regularly approached by readers living hundreds of miles away asking if I know a recruiter in their geography that might be able to help them find new work.  For every ten people that hate on recruiters

*How much solid career advice can you get from a new liberal arts or PE grad who was waiting tables until a couple months ago?*  Very little

I deal with internal recruiters that work at my client companies, I don’t really know anyone in your area”, I thought I’d provide some thoughts on methods to find someone you will want to work with in your job search.

Actually finding a recruiter should be quite easy

**How To Find Your Recruiter**

***Referrals from other technologists***

The most obvious way to find a recruiter is to ask around.  Who to ask?  Start with former (and current if you trust them) co-workers or friends in the industry.  Another source may be local user group and meetup leaders, should have a wider recruiter network than most.

***Referrals from HR/internal recruiters/hiring managers***

If you are lucky enough to have some contacts in HR or internal recruiting, will have some historical anecdotal data on their success rates with certain firms or individuals.

***LinkedIn***

Recruiters use LinkedIn to find you, PRETTY PICTURES!  Here’s how you do it:

1 – Click on Advanced at the top of the main LinkedIn screen (just to the right of the search bar) 


2 – On the upper left side of your screen you will see several fields.  Make sure you are doing a People search (and not a Jobs search).


3 – Type ‘Recruiter’ and something else that you feel is specific to you in the Keywords field.  Try ‘developer’ and the name of a technology that a recruiter might lazily use to brand you


4 – Enter the zip code of the area where you wish to find work and consider setting a parameter.  Some recruiters work nationally, you may want to select 25 or 50 miles (probably good for northeast or mid-Atlantic US), or up to 100 miles (for midwest).


5 – On the right


6 – Click Search


7 – Repeat


**How to Evaluate Your Recruiter**

We’ve found some LinkedIn profiles and viewed recruiter pics (some pretty

Just like recruiters do to find out more about you

As recruiters today rely heavily on LinkedIn

**Here are a few things to consider**

***Industry experience***

This will indicate quite a bit.  For one, loyal clients, and insight into the local market.  The job market turbulence of the first dot com boom/bust and the more recent recession have served to cull the recruiting herd, so those that survived through must have been successful.

Keep in mind that recruiting is highly competitive, some of the successful recruiters might just be the best at selling snake oil.

***Consistency***

There are a few different items to consider when we evaluate consistency.

Has this recruiter remained in the industry throughout their career or did he/she have some unrelated experience somewhere along the line?  For someone who leaves the industry and returns

Has the recruiter moved between agencies on a consistent basis?  The recruiting industry has job hoppers too

Has the recruiter bounced back and forth between the agency side and internal recruiting?  This one is important, a top agency recruiter can make two to three times (or more) as much as the typical salaried internal company recruiter at most firms (exceptions, of course), and agency recruiters often earn significantly more than the tech pros they represent.

So why would a recruiter leave a lucrative agency job to go work as an internal recruiter for a hiring company?  Stability is one factor

Some agency recruiters jump to the internal side because they couldn’t survive on the outside

***Credibility***

Does this recruiter have any details that stand out above the others?  A list of LinkedIn endorsements is a bit of a joke

A professional blog or writings can provide insight into the recruiter’s attitudes towards industry trends.  Is the recruiter involved with any industry organizations?  Has the recruiter actually worked in the technology industry

There are a few certifications that recruiters can achieve

***Conversation***

The best way to evaluate a recruiter is to talk to him/her.  Your career is important

Find a recruiter who shows curiosity in your goals before trying to push every job on you.  Is the recruiter even paying attention to what you are saying?

Recruiters are pretty.  Be selective in how you find one for yourself.",,t5_2sdpm,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1k1cwd/recruiters_are_pretty_and_how_to_find_one/

**Background:**

I remember reading this chart in my first and second year of CS course and being happy about seeing progress from 2^n to n^2 and in some areas even n. But I feel that I haven't progressed much since I finished my second year of the course. I have focused on AI, and theoretical CS subjects in my third year. The focus was not on good programming practices and improving those, but getting the damn things to work as they should and as well as they could in short deadlines. I am currently doing a masters completely focused on NLP and very research heavy, so there is little programming at all. I have done internships every summer and continued working throughout the year in my second and third year of my undergraduate degree. The final internship in the third year of the course was at a research focused group at university, and focus again was not on good practices but prototyping stuff and getting it to work as well as it could.

I am currently deciding between doing a PhD or going into industry. I recently had a phone interview with a big-4 company for a software engineering position. Since it went okay I might be invited to an interview. However, scoring lower in some areas than I used to because I forgot some things as well.

Overall

* 3 level 2^n
* 15 level n^2

Even with medicine and an interesting project, a url pattern, and an empty page.  I know the theory required for backend work.  I love crafting database schemas and that sort of thing.  I just flat out can't stay focused on it.

Front-end work gets done, especially for a ship-now-fix-later startup.

Often times I get stuck looping, churning CSS trying to figure out if line-height or padding or vertical-align is the way to style this navbar.

I have a terrible project history.  I was fired swiftly from the last company I was at, and academic projects, I quickly fall behind as I struggle to pull my weight in code.  I do fine telling other people exactly how to code and designing the overall idea, but I'm physically incapable of burning the midnight oil.  This leads to ruined friendships with my partners.  I watch them do all the heavy lifting, and my body tells me it's better to sleep or relax instead of getting in the trenches with them.  For my own work, I lose interest after the first hour of code and the prototype has been written.  I spend several days deciding on frameworks, copy-paste a block

The first company I worked with hired a new project manager fresh out of school

Everything was well, because of the high employee churn rate. 

Our softwares framework had been undergoing an upgrade, and the exceptions was high (so high that we were blinded about serious issues, because of all the exceptions).

On top of that

I was tasked with cleaning up the platform, and I gave a rough list on what needed to be done, and estimated it to take around a month to do. 

Our project manager refused, we could deliver in pieces, he refused. I later found out why he wanted me to spend two weeks, it was because projects that run longer than 2 weeks should be accepted by his superiors, so by his logic this meant: No projects longer than 2 weeks. 

We couldn't explain to him why fixing our platform was better than building new features on top of a broken fundament. We told him that these systems might break in the future

He always assigned frontend tasks to backend developers, and user satisfaction wasn't part of this report, so he was doing just fine!

I decided that my life was too short to argue with people that didn't understand what I was doing

After 1 month of being here

But he was an software-engineer

He is constantly sitting on our backs to get our sprint out. If we miss our sprint, making notes and interrupting our flow. 

From time to time a person from another department asks us about a technical issue, to learn how they use our software, and what their issues are.

Every time he is helping out in other departments and meets a question he can't answer, and he would go down to the person delivering our answer word-for-word. This can continue for 5 or six questions back and forth. 

People now know this, and here they can get an actual answer.

One time one of our developers was playing a game on his phone for something like 10 minutes, so it was just a show of power, but it killed the mood in the department.

I feel like he is short-circuiting our process

Talking with other departments is forbidden, and can't understand the technical consequences of his decisions.

1371573332.0,1glcst,Alternative Jobs for Bored Web/App Developers,fecak,23,4,5,"Original [here](http://jobtipsforgeeks.com/2013/06/18/alternatives/)

I’ve recently seen a spate of engineers declaring boredom and/or dissatisfaction with their current roles and responsibilities, but whenever a professional invests years of their life getting an education and honing their skills, it can be daunting to think that the time was somewhat wasted.

Thankfully, without considering the fact that these other alternatives exist.  If the source of discontentment is tied to the role of app or web dev work (and not the overall tech industry), there are some relatively new roles that have become more in demand that may satisfy the itch you have.

This information may also be useful to new entrants into the market and grads that are wondering what they can do with their computer science degree other than just stereotypical development roles.

Here are some examples (some have crossover and similarity):

* **Performance Engineer** - This role isn’t about building a product

* **QA Automation Engineer** – QA is one discipline that seems to have gone through some significant changes over the course of my career (15 years).  In the late 90′s, there seems to be some resurgence of demand for QA to be performed domestically, and hires typically will be expected to have some automation and scripting experience.

* **DevOps Engineer** – This  is another role that has been growing due to the number of shops that like to deploy frequently.  As the trend in delivery will not be changing anytime soon

* **Configuration, combined with the popularity of cloud-based computing, the concept of configuration management is changing.  Demand for talent in these areas is relatively steady.
Embedded Systems and Firmware Engineer – Although the transition from your typical app or web developer position may be a bit more complex

* **Project Manager, and your appreciation for development should maximize your shot at being successful.

1371136910.0,1g9sze,How To (Partially) Control Your Technical Interview -Job Tips For Geeks book excerpt,fecak,26,9,21,"Generally speaking

As was stated before, it is quite likely that you will be asked questions pertaining to subjects that are not within your areas of expertise.  Trying to fully eliminate the exposure of certain vulnerabilities is an exercise in futility, but there is one rather effective method to at least attempt to mitigate the risks.

There is an increasing trend in the technical hiring world for employers to request firm evidence of a candidate’s abilities that go beyond what a traditional résumé includes.  For programmers, and are routinely asked “Do you have any apps available?” as part of the vetting process.

One way to partially control the content and direction of your interview is to provide interviewers a work sample that will presumably become a point of discussion.  This will turn what could be a technical interrogation into a version of show and tell.  Even if the exchange about your sample only takes fifteen minutes

To employ this tactic, or a link to sites that you developed are much more graceful than large file attachments.  You can choose to extend an invitation to view these projects as early as your résumé submission, and when scheduling the interview you can express your willingness to discuss the projects in more detail and offer to bring a laptop with samples.

Independently volunteering to show representations of what you have produced will give an employer the impression that you are both willing and able to demonstrate the quality of your work.  That act makes the applicant appear more open and trustworthy than someone who hesitates when asked for some samples.  Recruiters and hiring managers alike will welcome résumé submissions that are accompanied by additional supporting evidence of a candidate’s abilities.

When you enter the interview

--Soon-to-be CS grad (December).

--3.5+ GPA from a nationally recognizable (but not elite) school.

--Interned at a large

--Two other internships in addition to the above.

--Very strong soft skills (e.g. writing/public speaking/presenting).

--Proven skills in desirable areas (mobile and web development).

--Proven ability to think differently (through innovative projects I've created or taken on).

For a variety of reasons that I'll only bother to expound upon if asked

These are some of the tangible reasons for my concern:

--I accepted a mediocre starting salary (it's actually quite poor with respect to the upper echelons of the tech industry), I feel like I severely undersold myself.

--The job involves travel. This sounded exciting to me until I actually started traveling regularly for interviews. While traveling, but it actually amplifies it tremendously.

--I have a strong suspicion that my skills will be underutilized

I quickly got up to speed and became a productive little software engineer. Every so often I'd experience what I now call a corporate-hiccup: restricted access to a seemingly random selection of websites (along with the usual social sites), somewhat expected and acceptable, but the benefits still far outweighed the annoyances, especially now that I'd discovered the perks of being salaried (lax hours) as well as realizing that I had a great boss and some fun coworkers. The workload wasn't that bad, and I'd yet to feel pressured in the work I was doing. I even scored a promotion due to the work I was doing.

A few months ago we moved to a new building and even though the screen-peeping potential of the cubes went down, and we had a new dedicated project manager reporting directly to upper management. This project manager began hiring business analysts to write out specification documents, so in theory our time could be better used developing instead of writing the specifications prior to development.

A month after our move our direct boss told our group that project and upper management wanted daily time sheets with detailed explanations of all development being done. This in and of itself was fine and understandable; having an idea of what's going on could conceivably make it easier for the powers that be to better allocate time for projects. The morale kicker from that same meeting was that some of us liked to take breaks walking around the building to clear our heads

Last week our direct boss again took us all aside and told us that one of the departments our team works with will not be able to hit an extremely high priority goal and despite our team being able to hit it no problem we're taking the hit for it. He then explained how our Exec. VP has perceived our group to be leaving early due to his late-afternoon meeting where a number of us are gone after 4pm and thus not at our desks that are outside of the conference room. Even through explanations that some developers come in early and thus leave a bit early

Various conversations have brought to light the fact that management feels we're not working hard enough to bring about goals they feel must be met. They want innovation and new features in their product while simultaneously weighing us down with development maintenance and customer contractual obligations. Feature lists get bottlenecked in meetings meant to prioritize development, and we get the heat for not working hard enough throughout their entire process. Some developers seem to think management is trying to push my boss out, and now the best thing we can do is just work as fast and hard as possible to try and score ""big wins"" for our group.

The internship will last for the summer


I am working on a surprisingly large codebase which was built by one developer. It is an almost-complete app


The problem is that the app is horribly written. I know that clean objective c is hard to write, and is organized bizarrely. A good example of the bizarre organization is that interface elements perform logic, and therefore changing them is non-trivial. The source code is also very very fragmented - each class has many subclasses, and most classes have only a few lines of code. The code is further complicated by the lack of ARC (a sort of pre-memory management, which automates releasing memory blocks).


When I inquired from the previous developer about the lack of comments and unit tests, which ARC will not allow', and also mentioned that 'some level of memory leaks is normal'.


My 'mentor' for the project, so it is hard to explain to him the issues with the code. I'm trying to write well-documented and tested code, but that takes time, and he usually wants things done quickly.

Quick background:  I am 34 and this is actually my second time changing career paths - I worked as a repair jeweler (family trade) for several years before heading back to school (prompted by the '08 recession) for a Finance degree (math was always my best subject).  I took a job in corporate accounting, I have a Finance degree and I needed to pay the bills.  After learning a little SQL on the job, I started studying other languages in my off-time and realized that I really enjoyed programming.  I cancelled classes for an MBA program and decided to take a few CS night courses just to be sure.  I loved it!  After recently moving to SoCal for my wife's career, I am now in a position to go back to school full time to pursue a masters in Computer Science - starting this summer.

I guess I am just hoping for some thoughts and general advice anyone might have for someone in my position.  Thoughts about emerging sectors, areas of CS concentrations (mobile, database, biotech, robotics, etc.), grad school, or other programming resources.  

I realize I may be starting out a bit late (at 34), advice, guidance, or direction would be really appreciated!  Thanks for reading!

I have been into computers since I was about 10, and worked as a web developer for a few years in the late 90's. I didn't have a computer-related degree or certification and ended up leaving the field, and getting an Associates in an unrelated field.

Skip ahead to the present: I've been managing a small retail store for the past 6-7 years. I am good at my job, but there is no path to promotion for me there and there are other assorted factors making me want a career change.

I have made the decision to do what I probably should have done from the beginning, my interests are in web development and mobile apps, but would be flexible in my job search.

If I continue school part time, trying to get into the field while I finish the B.S. Either way, I will be looking to get into a field I haven't been in for a while, at an older age.

So, competing with younger workers, etc? Or will there be a demand for well-qualified new programmers regardless?

I plan on working on some personal projects, and am working on some classes on Udacity. I've been lurking on /r/cscareerquestions, /r/learnprogramming, etc, and soaking up info. I've been reading tech news, articles, learning about new tech and so forth.

Just became aware of this subreddit and would have posted here before.  The other thread helped me feel better about myself

I'm rather frustrated at this point in my career. I have a B.S in CIS (so not a real computer scientist - hard maths are not my strength) and ended up doing web dev for my internship and my current job (using PHP almost entirely, holidays or paid time off either, and to make matters worse, I'm the only developer (two html/css/design devs) - so I'm a JR Dev, but also the lead...

I like to consider myself a decent programmer, and work at writing only secure code (As best I know how - and try and constantly learn more about security). However, lately, my boss has been getting on to me about several things, a general trend of not being accurate at my time estimates (I suck at this) and bugs that pop up in my code regularly.

We have implemented a QA procedure, especially when a feature requires a bit of a rewrite of code.

I'm feeling pretty incompetant at this point. I've been with this job for about 2.5 years now

Added to this stress is the whole interviewing process of which I am not good with. While working here I've been applying and interviewing elsewhere (only a few interviews in 2.5 years of being here and looking - my low experience contributes to that I'm sure)

Should I re-think my career path here? I love to program

The Informatics program at my school requires you to specialize in an area (like business or CS). English is not one of those areas, the BS requires one more math course, more science electives, and CS electives in a specific area (A.I., languages, systems, robotics

Today’s software professional is under constant pressure to maintain a high skill level with an ever-changing palette of languages and tools, which to ignore, and what methods to use in the pursuit.

The first instinct to learn something new would naturally be to find some good resources online and perhaps acquire a couple books.  You can find presentation slides and videos, many of which they may never even get to use professionally.  Some even read with the goal of some certification, which they feel will demonstrate mastery of a new skill.

I have also come to know another group of technologists who are inclined to learning in a different manner.  This group starts off with some amount of reading as well, they actually try to build something.

As a recruiter, and then demo the app live.  The offer to present could be *“I think X looks pretty cool.  I’ve read about it but haven’t used it yet, but I’ll build something and present on my experience with X.  I can be ready in a month.”*

It appears that many technologists are very comfortable with the reading portion of learning, your creation has value.  Learning by doing is not a new concept, so the educational value is obvious.  What other value is there?

**Marketability and interview advantage**
I was prompted to write this post about book learning when I was reviewing my recruiting placements for the past year.  The developers I’ve helped into new jobs over the past year have (with few exceptions) had one thing in common – a portfolio of products and code.  This was rarely the case ten or even five years go

The biggest example of the value of ‘learning by doing’ and a portfolio is probably exemplified by the mobile app space.  It’s hard to sell yourself as a mobile developer if you don’t have any mobile app to show

Programmers who work in more secure environments, these candidates are much more liable to be subjected to a language interrogation and the game show style of interviews that many job seekers dread.  Marketability may be more tied to experience and somewhat arbitrary measurements of skill instead of demonstrable accomplishment for these candidates.

**Interview advantage**
Having a portfolio gives an interviewee a distinct advantage, it will almost certainly be included in the discussion, and one would hope that the code’s author should fare better on questions regarding that sample than on questions on random topics.  Even average developers should see performance improvement in interviews when the topic is their own code.

**tl;dr**
Read enough to get going, and practice talking about your creations.

During my last year there I got on w/ an internship as an application engineer for a company

I figured I'd just keep the job and try to move more toward a development job which is more of what I was looking for at the time.  Well as time went on I got more and more responsiblities at the job, and supporting more and more applications.

The problem was is I lost sight of the goal of becoming a developer because the company never really supported my requests to try and move over into a development role.  On top of that

I can't tell you how many god damn nights I've stayed from the morning all the way through 2 AM or so either working on critical issues or performing code releases.  I can't tell you how many god damn weekends I've spent working when I should be out enjoying my life.

Just this week I was woken up 2 hours before I'm normally supposed to come in and work because of the 24/7 page outs

It'd be different if I was rewarded for any of the tireless work I've put in at this company - everyone I work with says they love working with me and that I do a great job.  Yet I've been here coming up on 6 years now and I've never been given a substantial raise or promotion.  I get new projects and responsibilities put on my plate

One thing that really fucking got to me was a few months back it was the first time I had ever not answered a page-out.  And the reason was because for some reason in my own house my fucking phone wasn't getting service

The depression and shitty nights of sleep due to page-outs and the anxiety/stress placed on me by being on-call has made my life a living hell and I can't take it anymore.  This isn't how I ever wanted to live my life.   I'm making shit salary anyway so it's not even remotely worth it to go through this.

My question is if you guys were in my shoes would you quit without lining up another job first?  I ask this because I have had a hell of a time trying to find another job, not a software developer or software engineer.  And all those application engineer jobs require 24/7 on-call duties, which I don't want ever again.  It's a waste of your fucking life to be on these type of things.  

I can't seem to get anyone interested in me for software development jobs though


I don't really know where to go from here.  I mean I guess I could go back to school... and get a masters?  Seems kinda pointless in this field.  Is this what I'm going to have to do though given my situation?  Or do I need to start my own side project so I have something to show people on my resume?

I guess I am just a bit confused as to what is really required for a ""hire"" recommendation? For example

So my question is for those of you in the big leagues:

how well did you do in your interviews to get there?

Did you answer every question perfectly with elegant modular code and the most optimal solutions? 

Did you hack together workable solutions in a few cases and then discuss some engineer trade offs that might lead to discovering a better algorithm? 

Did you do really well in a few interviews and then just do okay in the rest?

Is the bar for the phone interview lower for than for the final hire?(I can't imagine why this would be)

How much is creativity worth? Or are you just expected to recite the solution that might be found in ""Cracking the coding interview""?

I think it would really be useful to get some truth as to the reality of the process as opposed to some kind of ""ideal"" of what it is meant to be and are what resources like ""Cracking the Coding Interview"" tend to portray.

About three weeks ago I received a internship offer from a very small company (Company A) for the summer.

Right here (cscareerquestions) I also read that March is getting late for getting internships. Furthermore, I've received a offer that is double in pay. Furthermore, Company B is bigger, much closer (15 minutes), and growing quickly.

Some background:

I'm a Junior in a CS program, and I've been working through a good Book and well-received online tutorial for OpenGL and Graphics Programming.  I also tutor Math/CS courses as one of my jobs (the other is working at a retail store).

My problem:

I lack experience.  My first time ever writing code was a Fundamentals of CS course, but the former is just in dicking around with UX stuff in Android and the latter was because I was bored for a week visiting family.  I'm keeping busy enough to spend most of my days off working on stuff, but there's really only so much I can cram into my brain in under two years.

I'm concerned that two to three years from now, he only knows how to program in three languages"" and proceed to throw it in the trash.  I'm positive that until that point I'll be very strong in C and C++ (possibly Java, if I feel like being a glutton for punishment), and my knowledge of modern OpenGL and math should be strong enough to warrant some kind of attention ... but still, I feel as though I'm going to be in limbo after I get out of the school universe and thrown in the real world.

I'm also concerned that wanting to further my math education will be a wasted endeavor.  It's one of my strengths and my school offers a lot of cool classes at the undergrad level.  I'm just afraid that if I learn stuff like Topology, etc it'll just be seen as fluff to a future employer because it may not be used.  There is a set of scientific modeling courses, but it's at the master's level and inaccessible to me.

What kind of stuff can I work towards in the next couple of years to ensure this doesn't happen?  Are there any Graphics/Simulation/Modeling programmers here that could perhaps lend some insight?  General insight as to what's happening in the ""real world"" in that area?

I have just recieved a job offer as an ""SEO/dot com marketing director"". The person who offered it didn't tell me much about what the job entails.  His description was as follows:

""... the requirements are intelligence, pay your dues before making a lot of money. If you are good then you can expect to make $200,000 a year. Understanding technology is a big plus. If you are interested in the job then I think you should come and talk to me immediately and I will show you what the job entails and see if it is something that you would like to make a career of.""

This is a teacher at the college I attend, but I'm not sure exactly what this job would entail. I've given him a call, but he has yet to get back to me.  I'd like some information from some other sources as well. Do any of you have experience with this? If I do take this job, what should I expect?

Thanks!

I am a software developer for a small company whose primary business is not software development.  I have been a development manager previously for a large company and managed a team of 11 developers. My current employer started out as a business without IT but found the need as the business grew.  Now the IT shop is 11 employees consisting of 1 IT manager, 1 hardware manager, 4 help desk / hardware technicians.
The IT shop started as 2 people doing every task thrown at them and trying to justify their jobs by improving everything with technology.
Now we have requests coming in from every direction and nothing is really prioritized as every one is working on their own thing.  The development manager is more of a lead programmer than a manager at this point.  At one point a prioritization process was put into place but our user community soon found out that by dropping the name of the president or department head, workarounds and other non standard practices are becoming the norm.  If this company were to ever go public there is no way that we would be close to SOx compliant.
I would like to present a solution for reorganizing the team and processes so that IT and the company as a whole will benefit.  I know what has worked for me in the past and what has worked at other companies.  At the same time I do not want to come across as a know it all and that my way is the only way.

Formerly I was a lawyer, I started a QA internship with the twist, that they expect me to continue working after doing a two month long internship. Just like any new employee, I am encouraged to order a PC to work on, paid by the company.

However, that there are no projects where they need a dedicated tester and they really don't seem to have time to bring me in projects for the sake of just letting me do something. 

I am told, I did read literature provided by the company and kind of got the idea, what testing is all about. Now, I just want to get my hands dirty.

So when today an administrative worker asked me, that I feel lonely and abandoned. She asks me what do I expect from third day at the office. I'm like... umm, if I were at home, I'd be coding hobby projects and this kind of internship is not fulfilling any of my personal goals.

I would love to get an internship this summer but most places require that you have your sophomore year finished and have a 3.0 (which I will have by the end of this semester), when I'll only be halfway through. Would I have any chances at landing an internship based on my history of past projects and taking a few CS classes early and high major GPA (even though my cumulative is less than stellar? Also, being in Ohio, what could an intern be expected to have thrown their way in terms of compensation?

2) I currently work as a TA for my university's intro programming lab. Someone in the lab asked me to tutor them on the side and offered to pay. A) How do I charge? By the hour? By the session? B) How much do I charge? I know if I was a tutor through my school I'd be getting paid at least $9/hr (pay is dependent on the total and level of classes you can tutor for).

3) Now that I've been doing C++ for a short while (and Java for 5 years), check if a string is a palindrome, etc.) but I feel that's over-simplistic and once I passed that I'd be overwhelmed once I started working.

**TL;DR - After 12 hours of interviews a company wants one more.  To find out where I stand and if they are serious I'm thinking of asking them to pay me $100 cash to come back in.**

The details:

Applying for IT/programmer job with 5 years experience.  Here's what I've done over the past few weeks:

-2-3 hours of assorted phone interviews

-3 1-hour online tests.  Some of it skills based

-8 hours on site interview where I did a 3 hour technical test and one on one interviews with 4 other people

It sounded good initially

Here's where I need advice:  As I was leaving the day long interview the recruiter mentioned that one of the people who was supposed to interview me was sick and that they might ask me to come back in for one last interview.  It's an hour drive each way to their office (I would be moving if I accepted the job) and I'm currently working so I have to take PTO to go there.  I'm beginning to feel like they are using too much of my time.  I can't imagine what more information they would need after all the input they've received and frankly I don't know where I stand in their process.  They are only hiring one person so they could be using my time when I'm only a contingency for a preferred candidate.

Here's the idea I'm floating:  If they ask me to come in for another interview I will agree on the condition that they pay me $100 cash for showing up.

My reasoning is if they are serious about paying me ~$100k then $100 is inconsequential.  However if $100 is too big of a risk for them then I save myself the cost and inconvenience of showing up.  If they are serious and pay me and it doesn't end up working out then I'm at least compensated a token amount for the 12 hours of time invested.

What are the most beneficial steps I can take to convince an employer that I'm employable?  Should I focus my time and effort on solidifying my knowledge on data structures and algorithms?

1331016017.0,qjukd,I am a QA engineer and I hate my job :( Help,mad_max_,15,1,12,"Dear Reddit

Just to give some history, Operating Systems and Computer Networks. 

When I graduated, I was finally offered a role with one of the biggest software companies out there. The catch was that it was a QA and not a dev job but I was desperate for anything and I had student loans to pay off. In retrospect, that might have been the worst decision I've made in my life. 

It was exciting initially - I had my first real job and the pay (to me) seemed fantastic. Flexible hours, then the excitement wore off and I started hating my job. The only times that I felt good about my work was when I was developing test automation but that was a really small part of my job. For the most part, I was running tests manually and filing bugs. I also realized that QA people are looked down upon by most developers in the industry. I started feeling that I wasn't utilizing anything that I learned in school and that I had wasted all those years of education. I also found out that I was woefully underpaid in comparison to the industry average. So I started looking for a new job.

So after one and a half years of working for my first employer, writing device drivers and operating system kernels. However, with the kind of experience that I have on my resume, the only kind of job offers that I get are QA related.

What advice does reddit have for me? Here is what I've thought of:

1) Writing open source code: I've actually been trying to contribute for a long time but its so freaking hard to get started. How do I find a project I like? How do I contribute to that project?
2) Working on side projects outside of work: Again
3) Apply for programming internships. Is this even an option given that I'm not a fresh college graduate any more?

TL;DR I am a QA engineer who hates this line of work after working two years in this industry. I'm desperately looking to move on to full time development roles but I'm getting typecasted into QA positions because of my prior work experience.

Please forgive any grammatical and spelling errors; English isn't my first language :) I'd sincerely appreciate any advice that Reddit has to give.",,t5_2sdpm,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qjukd/i_am_a_qa_engineer_and_i_hate_my_job_help/

I am an SDE with Amazon in a not-first-world location and am looking to transfer to Western Europe or, but haven't had the guts to ask them how they did it, for fear of having it known that I shop around.

This being said

- Did you talk to your boss first or did you first secure a position with the other team? My boss has been pretty supportive of me while on my current team, but by no means a rockstar.

- Best way to get in touch with other teams? Emailing their manager and taking it from there would do? I have aimed a couple of teams from both Retail and AWS and could do a good job learning about them and being able to handle myself in a discussion with the hiring manager. Just want to make sure he won't go straight to my boss after talking to me.

- How to reply to the question: ""Why do you want to move?"" I assume extra salary, nor do I know anyone in the places where I want to go. My own team does have people in seattle I could go to, but how can I go to my manager, ask for a transfer (which would involve the company giving me way more money) for me to do the exact same work, only over there? I have thought about ""Better opportunities to grow while at company hq in seattle"" but I'm still a (relatively) young engineer and could still grow right here for a few more years. Can't really complain of my team here, my workload, visibility, and if it were in seattle or london I could see myself remaining here for another 3-4 years

But there are certain projects that I had submitted few patches and then stopped contributing. Those forked repositories are still present but I do not pull changes from upstream to them.

Should I keep them lying there? 

I think it is better to remove because I do not even merge upstream to them anymore. A dead repo might leave a bad impression on the prospective employer. Secondly I hate seeing fluff when I go through my Github repositories. There is no way to ""archive"" a Github repo.

But then

What should I do in this case?

Chicago:  Mainly C#, the salary is lower and I'm unsure how a lesser known company will look vs. a bigger, well known company in terms of the future.  Ability to potentially wear more hats, but I don't see as much potential to advance within the company.  One last thing:  more vacation than anyone else (except Madison, if I got that).

Minneapolis:  PHP, other random things possibly.  Big Company, but more formal environment.  Liked the people, Minneapolis is still cool, also about ******* after sign-on bonuses + profit sharing for the first year.  Minneapolis and the company doesn't seem as exciting to me, but I still enjoyed meeting them a lot.

Rochester, low cost of living, high bonuses...essentially, the best overall offer money wise.  I really liked the people and company, but Rochester, MN just isn't a very exciting place (feel free to change my mind!).  Lots of potential here to move to other things like embedded systems development (I have a computer engineering degree plus a CS degree).

One of the locations has two similar offers

There are also two offers I may get in this coming week (I have to make a decision by the end of this week):
~~Madison, and may put me on a interesting career path starting out.  My chances of getting this seem high right now.  I also really like Madison.~~

San Fransisco, seems like a really cool company.  Unsure if they'll be able to extend an offer before the deadline, but they are aware of it.

So
* Small company (little salary) vs. big company (bigger salary) vs. Management Position in Madison (likely less salary
* Location
* Future Career (Advancement

Please, do share!

It's healthy for all of these high-school kids looking for direction to make realistic approaches to their future.  What kind of odds do they have of graduating with a CS degree?  What are the odds for a typical person who doesn't attend college to get a CS job?

Now to bring it to a full circle.  I think it's possible to do anything without college.  Especially computer science.  What say you CSCareerQuestions?


**EDIT**

One Particularly good response is networking.  I would answer this by saying voluntary local meetups are more valuable because you'll meet only people who love CS and not people who are there because they heard they could make money.  On top of that there is open source projects to actually work with others and learn good coding habits.

Another good point is pertaining to career fairs

**EDIT2**

Some data I find interesting and mentioned in the comments is opportunity cost.  You're easily spending 100k to go to college.  That's probably a low estimate too.

Average graduating student loan debt is 27k.
Min wage for 4 years @ 40 hour work week is ~48k
total using minimum wage = 70k opportunity cost

now factor in most people take more than 4 years and most people pursuing CS will be making probably closer to 20k/yr within a year.

1 year at 12k four years at 20k = 92k
stick with student loan since it was an average not based on time = 27k

opportunity cost = 119k",,t5_2sdpm,1355291985.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/14pe3i/can_someone_give_me_an_example_of_anything_you/

Every few months I usually have a personal project I work on. Often it turns out that they don't get completed because either I lose interest

My question is that is it worthwhile mentioning these projects in interviews or even resumes. I could see on one hand that it's good because it shows I'm doing something but on the other hand it could show that I don't have the ""drive"" to finish what I started.


For example:
I was getting frustrated because I had to deal with each college's calendar and how it was difficult to add events from them to my own calendar. So I used Java to parse webpages from many different sources and compile that into a local SQL database. I needed the local database to sort events and take out duplicates (if an event was listed across multiple calendars). Then all of the events would be uploaded to a Google Calendar account. The web interface (was in progress) was going to be a nice interface that allowed students to tag events (e.g #freefood), work, etc.

This was meant to be a simple

So this used basic Java, jQuery, and web languages.


I definitely learned a lot from the project but there wasn't an end product. This project definitely wasn't ground breaking or gonna-be-the-next-Google but it was definitely fun for me and addressed a need I had.

I'm a recent comp sci graduate with a little bit of personal experience that includes an iOS game and a few functional websites.  Now I'm pretty junior and went to one of those colleges where they taught very little about real world programming.  So confidence going into the job market during the 09 economy clusterf*ck was low at best.  And right now

* The first one (a small company) was a bust as the owner/manager was an a**hole and wanted me to work 80 hours a week on some non-stop multi-threaded application that three other junior level programmers couldn't even complete.  Heck this was a place that had a horrible reputation on job listings as being one of the worst places to work.  Long story short

* The next job was a big change as I was now working on a contract for a small business.  The difference is that I was trained and they taught me a hell of a lot more about programming then school ever did.  I did a great job and got along great with my co-workers (fellow geeks with same interests, and I had enough experience and knowledge where I was pretty confident to do most tasks.  My lead even gave me a reference to help me out.  I mean, I basically knew enough to implement most complex web apps.

* My last job was working for another small business (this time 3 developers), this changed as my lead started to push me to get my small project 1 done.  That was fine, and I tried getting it done that week.  He then gave me another small project 2 which I started working on.  A few weeks in they were bringing the small project 1 into production as one of the sales guys needed it to sell to a customer.  So they brought me in to help install it.  Ignoring a few installation hiccups on my part it installed fine.  I did that and then gasped as the damn thing stopped working.  Considering my lead was implementing a new clustering environment for the production servers, I wasn't too surprised.  But my lead and the sales guy where.  They were freaking out and basically had me sit there all with them as I tried to help debug the problems (they were all server clustering issues BTW, none my fault).  While I did get the project 1 to work eventually on production, this started a long long road of awkwardness in the office.  Every day there appeared to be less work for me to do.  I would ask for new work and they would awkwardly tell me to continue testing.  And eventually for a few weeks, I had nothing to do but test my old projects and try to find any kinks with em.  I knew this meant the end of my days there, but a few emails requests later revealed they were full of shit.  They claimed I was let go because I was too *junior* and would have trouble doing later work, but they let me go all the same.

My question is this, a personal ajax website (which will never take off lol), and some android apps, work is were everything counts and I'm starting to get worried.  I'm interviewing like crazy right now, but I'm thinking that one more bad slip up like this, and no one's going to want me to do their work.

Thing is, but it'd be amazing to study at a top school like Stanford or CMU for grad school.

I currently have a 3.8 GPA (3.95+ if you exclude my first semester) and study on a full-ride scholarship (which is why I came here).

I work part time at a software dev. place on campus, but it pays and its good experience. 

I do have some research experience

My GRE scores are decent (162 verbal, all of which are in the 90%+, except my quant score, which is in the low 80th percentile, so I'm a bit worried about that. 

I'm really passionate about CS and enjoy programming a lot. Would any of you know what my chances are at getting into a top CS grad school?

While I hope I'll improve my grade tomorrow it is possible that I will be left with an E on whatever report card you have when you finish a bachelor.

1. **How much would that affect you hiring me if you were looking at candidates?**

2. **Will my code/open source projects matter when it comes to getting a job?**

For my own sake I really do not care if I have an E on my card. Do I wish I had a better grade? Sure, and while having classes at school has taught me a lot, for example my algorithms and datastructures class, most of my knowledge comes from being interested in a topic for my personal projects.

Other than this class and two others (basically one class of two other semesters) my grades are usually A or B's.

The only reason I accepted so soon was because the interviews were so far apart and I knew I wasn't going to be hearing back from any of the other companies any time soon (plus the fact that I really liked the culture/freedom of company A). Otherwise I would have waited a while until getting other offers and using those as leverage for negotiations.

I graduated from a state school with a BA in Language and Applied Economics (I studied French and Arabic specifically). Well the job market for International Trade dried up before I graduated [ThanksObama.gif] so I worked retail and then got into political work. I then got into social media management for political candidates.

A couple moves later, focus on my studies, even learn new skills and change course without working, so I'm doing just that. I've decided that I want to get into development.

I figure that learning computer language/code is like learning any other language. It sucks and is incredibly hard at first but you eventually get the hang of it

So I'm teaching myself basic HTML and CSS and should be done within the week. I'm also learning C++, Asp.net, and probably PHP. I don't know what I'd study after that.

I'm also going back and studying Calculus and all the necessary maths on Khan Academy and other sites.

So far my career plan is this:

* Learn and practice languages
* Build projects and work on opensource stuff as much as possible to create a portfolio.

* Perform an internship(s)

Here's my scenario. 

I'm graduating in about a week. Long story short, but it turned out nicely and was well worth it. So now I'm getting my diploma in December.

Anyhow, 40 hours a week, $20/hour. Not so bad for an internship, I guess. But technically, since I'll no longer be a student, I'll be hired as a 1099, an independent contractor.

My question is this: Would taking this internship now be detrimental at all to my long term career? Should I turn down this offer and spend these next few months on a full time job hunt?

Or should I take the ""no experience is bad experience"" mentality, and more time to prepare and apply for permanent positions. There's also the possibility that this company may offer me a full time position when my time as an intern comes to a end.

I'm graduating in December of this year with a degree in Computer Science (B.S) and have been working as a paid intern for a government agency. My contract has been extended to continue working for them

I have a couple of questions regarding the search for job opportunities.  

It seems the area I live in doesn't have very many opportunities in the field of software development. Recently

For instance, then I read further and see that they want two years worth of related experience, which I don't have. On top of that they post things like ""the ideal candidate will have 5 years experience in..."", basically invalidating even their two year requirement.

Anyway

Recently though

The most drastic changes lately have come in the form of job responsibilites and unqualified management. I currently am the only ""computer guy"" in our small office, why the University wont increase our exchange server storage quota, or to organize all photos on our server. 

This morning I arrived to find an email in my inbox marked ""EXTREMELY URGENT"" asking me to come solve a computer issue with one of our 'researchers'... which turned out to be that they couldn't remember how to change their desktop background in Windows 7 and needed to change it before giving a lecture.

I can't help but feel like I'm being turned into our IT support person now. I absolutely **LOATHE** doing IT ... i don't enjoy helping other people with computers and getting yelled at for their mistakes (I did 2 years in a IT/help desk call center when i was younger.... i know the drill) ... and part of the reason I got into web-dev was be able to keep working with computers while I finished school without completely losing all hope &amp; dignity.

I'm half way to my 8th year as ""The IT department"" for a small travel marketing company. It's my first job straight out of college and there's no growth. My position is the only position there is (well there was an IT manager, development, desktop support, project planning, server maintenance, liaising with 3rd parties for outsourced projects on technical level etc. Being that it's a fairly small company, there weren't any major projects to work on

I don't have 7 years .NET experience, I'd get a call from someone saying ""my emails are not working, please fix it"" and then when I was done sorting that out, something else would pop up. By the time I'd get back to my desk I'd have completely lost where I was or would have just lost my train of thought. By the time I got back into things, it would be a rinse-repeat of what happened before.

At the beginning it was all well and good, not so much. Since there's no ladder to climb there's also no promise of a substantial pay increase. I now feel unchallenged and since I've recently gotten married, a pay increase is somewhat needed.    
    
As far as qualifications go, I haven't used in all my time here (Java, Oracle, C++), and I've forgotten most of it (especially the complicated, advanced things) and all that I do work with, has been self taught (VB, SQL 2000/2005
    
What I know I'm good at is solving problems. Any problems, since I've been breaking and building PCs since I was a kid, but since this is a hobby, I wouldn't like it to be my defining skill. Dev is pretty quick to pick up (when I have time) but my problem here is that in my 7 years here, I've picked up bad habits since I was a 1 man dev team and had to develop ad hoc. All I would get pushed for was for things to work rather than to get things to work efficiently and well designed. So I really have no idea if my shit is good or bad.         

I am dev, ""have you completed this?"", ""this doesn't work, you need to fix this"", ""hey this works pretty well""). Though I would be a bit bold and say that my bug finding skills are pretty decent.

I need to know what type of job I can look for if I intend to move from a situation and environment such as mine. 

If there's anything that I need to clarify let me know.

TL;DR: 7 years exp as 1 man IT department. Various skills. Nonspecialist. Need help finding a better

1337621696.0,txs1v,1 year after graduation and I'm in quite the unhappy bind.,Awesumness,16,5,12,"Summaries have been bolded for your pleasure.

I graduated in Spring 2011 with a dual major in Computer Science and Computer Engineering from University of South Florida at a 3.77 GPA. I've worked in Java,jQuery,CSS,HTML) and some basic Python. **Essentially, I love exploring, learning, and exercising all the technologies I touch.**

I already had a job lined up for late June as an Integration Specialist which is categorized as Software Developer here (flight simulator company). I soon found out there was very little development and the job was mostly high level testing (flipping switches and illuminating lights powered by very basic in-house scripts), much less one outside of the simulation industry (it's a lot of special purpose hardware and software).The pay is good (maybe? 54K for a new grad in Tampa) and offers quite a bit of fun travel (per diem, flights, hotels, rental cars and I get to keep the hotel/airline points for personal use... a year in Hawaii starting fall 2013 if I'm still here...), but the work is simply not what I want to be doing in the slightest. **I've spent more time with a screw driver in my hand than production level developing.**

In August 2011, real-time Google Maps location, history using SQLite) but it looks pretty bland. I haven't put it on the Market or github since development stalled while I was traveling (Jan-April) and using my company's laptop. The past few weeks I've been experimenting in C#, .NET, Javascript+jQuery, CSS and HTML on Elastic Beanstalk for fun. I know all of the client side stuff from years on userscripts and userstyles, and the C# and .NET from university. **I enjoy developing in pretty much everything I've looked at.**

This is where it gets good! I've been trying to apply to jobs in Seattle and San Francisco on and off since August and it's been pretty grim. At first I had my Dice profile with my real Tampa address and genertaed hits from all over the US *except* the West Coast. After talking to dozens of recruiters, my resume address was still Tampa). So lately I've been getting Seattle hits but every time my location comes up, they other side goes cold. A ""Director of Development"" from a startup-ish company contacted me over email and we really hit it off until he reread my location. I offered to fly myself out and stay a week on my own money (points accumulated from my current job) for the interview process and he STILL turned me down. I made the same offer to a consulting company who was greatly interested but they were said no, too. There have been plenty more but these two were reallythe most recent and most promising (like ""can you come in for an interview tomorrow?""). **Seattle has been impregnable from Tampa so far. Need more tactics.**

I interviewed for two separate Amazon positions and got denied after the second phone interview on both occasions. For the second process I was caught with my pants down during travel and no computer of my own... I froze up and botched coding over the phone while sitting in my car at my work's parking lot. **Botched Amazon interviews. I think I'm out of their ""new grad"" classification now. Still trying.**

I'm pretty sure my resume can't handle another year at my current job and still appeal to development roles... So worst case is I pick up and move to Seattle close to the end of August. I'm about to completely pay of my new car

So yeah

My likes in the field are Software Engineering

The only true reason I am even considering getting a Doctorate is because most of my family and professors consider me extremely smart, Higher level Maths have been a struggle for me [mainly trigonometric Calculus]) and a cousin of mine whose ""smartness"" I am on par with is finishing her her Doctorate thesis (I believe it's kinesiology, or sports medicine, something like that. She's REALLY into exercising and stuff like that) in I think 6 years (from graduating HS). I would have been finished with my undergrad already, and probably half-way through my Masters, but living in Texas and having gone to two higher-education schools that have screwed me I've been delayed into graduating on a ""normal"" schedule.

On Monday I started a new job. I'm working on a product that has a lot of social networking integration, manage your social media accounts, and stuff like that. All very interesting stuff and that's what got me excited about it. 

Now, that's what it's like. Full of spaghetti code, and code is coupled so tightly that when you make a change here, something breaks over there. Tests? Well, they're there, but not really being used. Case in point: when I run ""rake spec"" I get about 122 failing cases. When I brought this up, the lead developer just shrugged his shoulders and said they're all old anyways and a lot of things have changed.

Other things I've learned - this project is about four months old, things started getting more serious and more people were put on. The lead guy got a full time position. Now, there is a hard deadline in the room of April 1st. This is when this thing is supposed to be done. For this purpose, they've been hiring a couple more developers (all full time), including me. However, there is not project management to speak of and nobody seems to have the skills. We're doing useless meetings that feel more like discussions about problems we're facing but no real decisions are made. No commitment, no ownership

Now, I did at least learn a lot of good project management skills. We did a pretty stringent agile process with daily scrums and for all the flaws I still saw in it, at least we got stuff done, on time, almost every time. 

So

I'd especially appreciate to hear from people who have been in a similar situation. 

**TL;DR: After starting a new job

EDIT: Just got out of another meeting. Depressed faces all around, ""I don't know"", ""maybe"", and even ""we're fucked (if)"". At this point it looks like I'm humping a dead horse.

What gives me the biggest pause in making a jump back to a programming role I think is my age relative to my programming abilities.

I am going to be 40 this year and have been in the IT field for about 10 years (about 6 programming).
From everything I have read 40 is considered ""old"" for programmers.
Many companies will hire the young college grad (or just young in general) knowing they will be able to pay them less and get more effort out of them.
Someone who is 40 and aging will have a family and expect to leave at 5 or 6 in order to spend time at home. Which

Also
I still have trouble cobbling together basic Grails apps. Not to mention I can't recall the last time I even developed a web application from scratch. 
Although
For someone with my years of experience I should be able to understand good application design and know when to use certain patterns in a program.
If I were to spend another 5 years trying to obtain this knowledge I would be 45!! (wow I am getting old). I worry what is going to happen if I have to look for another job.
I will likely not have the experience necessary and on top of that be the ""old"" guy.

Now
With some type of managing I feel I could move out of tech if it were necessary. If I were to go back to programming I would be just another developer not even a senior developer at that.

The biggest thing I think is I am worried about age and ability. At my age shouldn't I be leaving programming to the younger ones who WANT to pull late nights and study all weekend?
On second hand moving into a managerial role and sitting in meetings all day is just NOT appealing at all.

Experiences I've enjoyed:

* Finding unique solutions to technical problems. Example: writing an update trigger to automatically populate data.
* Deploying a new application across the organization
* Creating scripts to compare information in databases
* Talking with the higher-ups to streamline operations way outside of IT's scope

However

* Phrasing a document just right
* Anytime the phone rings
* Users getting irate that things 'aren't done right' even though 10m ago I was getting complimented for the changes I've made
* Perpetually trying to put new policies in place so that users don't hit their head against the wall

I realize some of those issues are going to be with me no matter where I go in IT

I've noticed that I enjoy programming. I like writing the SQL triggers

Basic info:

- CS degree from New Mexico Tech.
- C+/B- GPA with a few terrible semesters (F's, C+ is 2.33 by how they calculate it).
- Basically 0 web-dev experience, and CSS modification of CMS/Forums.
- Great grades in weird/hard topics like compiler writing, embedded systems design.
- TA'd/taught some of compiler writing (with great reviews).
- Did some basic Java programming and real-time linux kernel modification at a part-time job for an observatory.
- Partially completed some grad school (this feels like a last resort and not really what I want at the moment).
- I live in a tiny town in a rather unpopulated state.  There's a whopping 2 jobs listed for my entire state on stackoverflow.  Thus I'm almost guaranteed to need to move somewhere else for work.

Every job I've found seems to be web development with a bunch of technologies I've never used (or even heard of, as well, is web-dev.  I'd even love to have a portfolio that extends beyond what I made in college.

I am a student living in San Francisco. Two days ago it was announced that following this school year the college I am attending, so you can see where the problem begins. 

Currently my school is the only option within San Francisco

I am somewhat hesitant to transfer to another two year institution and lose my current progress

My current school still has the option to appeal the loss of accreditation and I will be working hard with everyone at my school to make sure that we stay open and I can avoid all of this. However

If my school were to close, to begin working internships in San Francisco instead of transferring to an out-of-city school? I'm willing and eager to self-teach programming and would prefer to not have to restart my college education. The problems that I've heard on this subreddit, concerning no degree, is that it will probably bite me in the ass somewhere down the line. 

Working internships while transitioning into a job at any of the companies would be a dream
