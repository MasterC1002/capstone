&gt; Just to quickly confirm

&gt; Shifting audio is also something that can become more prominent when the cars transmission is upgraded.

In Forza 4 your exhaust sounds are always the same, they gave you the ""best"" noise in FM4. I like the idea of your exhaust sounding better when you upgrade it in Horizon not only changing but increasing volume. 

This should be comforting for those of you who think the Evo is too quiet,,False,self,t5_2rzao,False,horizon,True

The guidelines I'm posting of course are a generalization. There are exceptions to every rule and every car is going to be somewhat unique to others. You will have to make adjustments here and there and some cars are just not going to be good in your desired class no matter what you do. 

As far as getting the right car. Light cars with mid engines are almost always going to be a successful car to build. If you are just starting out try picking one of those. The Fiero is an excellent example of how effective a light mid-engine

Tertiary to the car and the driver's skill level

I'm going to give a simple guide on upgrading and why I choose those particular upgrades. I'm not a mechanic or a scientist or a sandwich artist

I'm going to assume that most people race in the C to S range of classes so I'll base my guidelines off of that. You should try racing the GT and LMP classes though

-----

**Priority: Always**

Race Brakes: The cheapest and most effective upgrade for any class. Braking is half of racing and this gets you the biggest bang for the buck.

Race Suspension and ARB (rollbars): You need to get the most out of whatever tires your are using and this is how you do it. Without the adjustable suspension and ARB you are going to lose tire contact all over the place. You obviously want to keep your tires as parallel to the road as much as possible. You will need to adjust your spring and roll bar settings later but without these upgrades you can't.

RWD Swap (if available): Aside from driver skill needed

Race Differential: (credit spooncow) For a drop in one even two PI you get the ability to some pretty amazing things tuning out over and understeer. This should always be put on.

-----

**Priority: Very High**

Race Weight reduction: The only reason this isn't an always upgrade is because the PI changes are so drastic that you can't always do it without jumping into to high of a class. In that case take the highest possible weight reduction. This is a one for all upgrade that increases

Rear Adjustable Spoiler: If you want to get around turn 1 on Road America or the Mobil 1 turn on Hockenheim with doing involuntary cookies or staying anywhere close to on track on Nordschleife you will need this. You will take a little hit on acceleration and a bigger hit on top speed but that is great because unless you are setting up a car for Old Mulsanne you won't need it. The added benefit of being able to stay on the track on fast curves is a necessity. Exceptions to this rule might be an AWD setup.


*different viewpoint per Knowltey - Don't quite agree with the rear adjustable spoiler being that high. It's very situational

-----

##Begin Loop

**Priority: High**

Tires: This is where shit starts to get cloudy. Compound and width. This is all going to be dependent on what you're working with and what class you are building for. Below I'm listing what I believe is a good starting point for tire upgrades for each classes. Of course this is all subjective and use common sense. The important thing to remember is don't upgrade to too much tire! You don't need race tires in C class nor do you always want to upgrade tire width. 

* S Class - Race compound
* A Class - race compound with minimal width upgrades
* B Class - sport compound and width upgrades
* C Class - street and width or sport compound at highest. Sometimes you can even get away with stock compound. You should start with the lower end of tire upgrades.

Ok

The first thing I look at is if the intake is N/A

You should start with the lower end of tire upgrades.

Now that you have the car close to the max PI for the class you need to take it out on the track. Preferably a Grand Prix circuit that is a good mix of straights and corners. Pick one you are consistent at. You should turn off any TCS or STM for testing and tuning even if you plan on using it while racing.

You should know pretty quickly which direction you need to go with engine/tire upgrades. 

If the car is sluggish through corners and slippery on throttle then you will need to upgrade the tires and reduce the engine upgrades and retest. Start with tire width upgrades before moving to compound upgrade.

If the car go through corners like a slot car and seems impossible to get it to lose grip on corner exit then you likely have too much grip. Yes

Your goal during testing is to get the car nice and loose and fast. You can tune out any extra oversteer later. It’s better to start with too much than too little.

If you are still unhappy try swapping out engines and or supercharger and turbos and repeat the process.

##End Loop

Now that you have found the sweet spot between grip and power its time to do some finer builing to maximize your build.

-----

**Priority: Medium**

Front Adjustable Aero: If your RWD car is turning in really well and has plenty of oversteer then chances are you won’t need it. You still might consider adding this as it might not affect the PI and will help with shorter tracks. This is higher priority for FWD cars to make sure your power is getting transferred though and high priority for AWD to get some extra oversteer.

Roll Cage: This is going to affect the rigidity of your car and you will get more out of it with older and bigger cars. Add this if you feel you need to get rid of some body roll. If your car is already quite rigid you might opt out of adding the roll cage.

-----

**Priority: Low or Optional**

Coolers: These exist in real life mostly to protect your engine from going kaboom and have virtually no effect in game

Race/Sport Transmissions: I’m sure I will get people who will disagree with me here, Nebraska, I can adjust my gear ratios”. Yes, you can, but adjusting gear ratios doesn’t lower PI and the acceleration vs speed seems to me to be negligible in this game from doing so. **If you have the PI room, by all means go ahead, and on some cars it may make little PI difference. Look and see what the effect is on the top speed before making the choice.**

-----

**Priority: Useless**

Clutch and Drive: Yes, then upgrading these will basically do nothing for you. Go ahead and upgrade them if you need the extra couple of PI, but for no other reason.

*Edit:  If you are an automatic user

-----

I think that covers just about all the upgrades. By no means is this a magic bullet. But it should help those in need to get started.

We ALL KNOW Forza has a two(-ish) year release cycle. It's been that way from the beginning. You will get Forza 5 come November 2013

But, what Microsoft (I'm sure most of you know this, but T10 is owned by Microsoft) does, is create a smaller sub-studio (made of of people that worked on Grid, Dirt and PGR) and have them release an arcady racer, using the previous Forza game's engine) that is (hopefully) better than NFS, Burnout or whatever else comes out.

This will allow them to recoup more of their investment

**TL;DR** Forza as you love it isn't going anywhere and is still on an odd-year release cycle. Horizon is for people who like casual racers and will be on an even-year release cycle assuming it does well.",self,t5_2rzao,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/forza/comments/ur3gu/i_feel_like_you_guys_dont_understand_horizon/

1367887086.0,1dtw1d,Spirit's Drift School: Part One - Introduction,Spirit612,47,13,38,"Okay guys, strictly reddit based considering there is a few on the forza forums already. This ""school"" will be run completely by me. It will be very forum-based as I can only really commit to a lobby Saturday nights. It will have a curriculum as follows:

**The Basics**

*Choosing your car - We will be running RWD

*Building your car - We will be learning about the different parts and how they will effect the car's weight and overall driftability. 

*Tuning - I'll be going over the drift aspect of each tuning option

*Technique - I'll be teaching you the basics of the various techniques used in drifting. 

*Track Time - This will be on most Saturday nights or anyday that I am on Forza I'm more than happy to hop in a lobby with you and give you some 1 on 1 time.

*Exercises - Here I'll share my ways to make you a better drifter. One of my favorites and most effective is using a simple tuned AE86 (generally in a very low class) and drifting down Fujimi (a rarely used track by tandemers)


**Phase Two**

*Tracks - I'll be showing you some of the drift sections, tends to be the racing line.

*Judging Criteria - In this section, angle and overall impression. Also some common courtesies like a 50 roll start and the no passing rule. 

*Advanced Techniques - These will just be some ways to drift that you shouldn't attempt until you're comfortable in your car. 

*Major Things to Make Sure Of - This will just be stuff like: Don't switch cars every session. I cannot stress this enough. I've known too many potential greats that fail to excel due to them changing cars all the time. You'll see me in many cars but I've been doing this long enough to know how to drive them. When you're first learning it's a must to at least learn in a single car

*More Track Time - Here we'll be seshing on tandem tracks. 


**The Finale** 

*Final Techniques - More techniques with tuning or driving that would only work for drivers who have mastered the others.

*Last Words of Advice - I'll share any final tips or tricks that I feel would benefit you. 

*Release - Congratulations

Let me know what you guys think. If you want to partake in this,False,self,t5_2rzao,1367956184.0,forza4,,t3_1dtw1d

This plan was made with a few things in mind. We want tuners

**Although it will be a bit more difficult organization wise

Based on previous discussion


**RDTR**: The best we have! Invite or recommendation only. Top drivers and tuners go here.

**RDT2:** Competitive. Above average drivers

**RDT3:** Social/training group. Casual drivers or drivers wanting to improve. Uses more assists in lower classes. May be not so familiar with tuning. No or very few high ranking times. 

**RDTD:** Since drifting is a a whole different ball game for tuners and drivers it makes the most sense to leave the existing group intact as the official drifting club. 


**This has not yet been finalized but we have found people ready and willing to manage the individual groups so it may be happening before the weekend. I will continue to manage RDTR. We ask that at least initially you really do a self assessment and decide which group best suits your skills and abilities.** This means that RDTT, self assess to avoid a later awkward convo) we will certainly need the help. 

Club leaders will play a big roll in moving people around. After a ""Settling down"" period of about a week RDTR will set some qualifying criteria that has yet TBD. This will likely mean naming a track and class

Once the clubs are established we'll make threads that will be linked in the sidebar to post your gamertag for verification. My suggestion so far is that club leaders turn invite requests OFF and invite on an individual basis but that may change/I'll let you guys decide. 

So far the club leaders are:

RTDR: Me

RDT2: Chonody

RDT3: Aik2124

RDTD: Zerrrro




Any questions, critiques, suggestions are greatly appreciated and of course will be considered. Pending any major issues I plan to move forward in creating the clubs as early as **tonight**. 

Slow is smooth


**tldr: STOP MAKING NEW CLUBS**

**Edit**: It already looks like RDT3 will be taking a lions share of the members. It's important to be accessible and that means not having a capped lower tier. Don't underestimate your ability. There is absolutely no shame in getting dropped down later if you are REALLY don't belong there but I would hate to see RDTR have 20 people

I'm glad this plan seems well received. I'll start the process and update the sidebar tonight and make threads for gamertag verification. ",self,t5_2rzao,True,,RDT2,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/forza/comments/lc69n/so_heres_the_plan_to_expand_the_clubs/

1367961871.0,1dvzhq,Spirit's Drift School Part Two: The Basics - Section One,Spirit612,40,11,20,"Alright guys here it is

**The Basics**
* Choosing your car - Okay
    * RWD or RWD convertable
    * Under 3400lbs
    * NOT supercars or exotics
    * Front engine
    * Low powered
Now I know a lot of you might say ""Hey, you're wrong"". Well, no. Sorry, I'm strictly basing my build tendencies on real life aspects. Yes Ken Block might ""drift"" in his AWD Fiesta, but it's not exactly considered proper drifting. In the professional drift leagues (Formula Drift, D1GP, British Drift Championship, I can not stress this enough
  A drift car should be decently lightweight otherwise you will need more horsepower to push it around and keep the tires from catching traction. Lighter cars tend to stay loose easier
  Okay, so let's pick our School Car shall we?
  For the typical learner, in America, the 240SX. In Europe I believe they are called 180SX and come with a different engine and all kinds of other things that I don't care to get into right now. So, in Forza, anything under the Nissan manufacturer that has ""**S**ilvia"" in it's name is an S-chasis along with, of course, the 240SX hatchback. I own a hatchback in real life but, I recommend the S14 or ""the black Silvia K's"" for those who don't know the Silvia models. This is an excellent starting car as it meets the criteria nicely

* Building your car - Okay
    * Race Everything in Drivetrain will make your life a lot easier
    * Race Everything in Platform and Handling will allow fine tuning in suspension
Having those parts will make drifting a lot nicer. Other parts you can add are simple performance parts to up the horsepower and torque of your car. For this lesson

* Tuning - This is generally the hardest part of drifting. Because it involves time and effort
    * Tire Pressure - Simple rule here: Higher = less grip, also want to be around that number. Since the rear tires, while drifting, are constantly spinning thus constantly being heated up, you want their cold psi (what you tune) to be about 2psi lower than the front. However, since we will be using a nearly stock car with low horsepower, we'll be bumping the rear up in psi. Remember
    * Camber - the best way to understand camber is to visualize a car with the wheel all the way turned in one direction. The wheels will look like this from a sky view / /------/ /   Now, since they guide you to where you want to go, you want a lot of grip up front. Since half your tire isn't even on the ground at full lock when drifting you don't have a lot of tire on the ground, meaning you don't have a lot of grip. This can be corrected using camber. Not too much though, you don't want to have negative camber at full lock because then you'll have an equal but opposite effect on your grip where the other side of the tire will be off the ground. 
    * Toe - Another important adjustment in drifting. This is generally left alone by some drifters and can be a major factor to others. It's all personal preference. Toe has to do with your traction going straight and traction while turning. You want a stable car, to start off, running 1.2 positive (to the right) in the front and .3 negative (to the left) in the rear. This is a base setting for a generic tune. I recommend you go into test drive and mess with this yourself once you learn how to drift. 
    * Caster - this has to do with how the tire leans at full lock. Kind of like a motorcycle front wheel. It allows you to run extra camber if you absolutely need it but I tend to leave it alone as I find camber being a small part of my drifting tunes.
    *Gear Ratios - This is vital and can only be done by you. Your final drive, you shouldn't be spinning still. The midpoint of your third gear should be crossing the center line on the graph. Your second will be in the middle and your fourth and fifth gears should be a little past each other. You will really only use 2nd, 3rd, and 4th while drifting so 5th and 6th really don't matter. 
    *Anti Roll Bars - These will change the stiffness of your car just like springs. What I've noticed is that the softer your rear roll bar the further you swing out when drifting. Good numbers for this in cars that meet the basic criteria are usually around 21 in the front and 18 in the back.
    *Springs - This tightens or loosens the car. If your car experiences major body roll while drifting, you may need to loosen them. Stock settings are decent on drift cars with Race Springs. For cars with low horsepower, you may want to tighten them about 60. For cars running more horsepower in the 300-400 you could loosen them about 60. Anymore than that I suggest loosening them 150-200. 
    * Dampening - This effects turn in response. No matter what kind of car I generally soften them up to about 5.5 and 5.2 in the top bars and about half of each number in the top to the bottom in their respective front/back order. 
    * Braking - For drifting
    * Differential - By far the most important piece to drifting. In real life, put them to 100% 100% and do another donut. See what I mean? For drifting remember this simple rule: 100-100 is the best. It's simple, it works.

And then he said the line that I have been dwelling over:

""I could have spent $130+ on this game on release day and still would have had to choose between the Mercedes SLS or Ferrari 458 Italia. That is absurd.""

It is absurd. Those cars are staple cars for a racing game. I'm fine with cars like the Mine's Skylines being unicorns or pre-order bonus cars. I was even ok with the 1M

Developers keep pushing the envelop of what we as consumers are willing to pay. I've bought every single DLC for Forza to this point

Developers and publishers will continue to nickle and dime us until we stop buying, they will simply blame it on piracy and the used game market, and try to charge more. They'll drive themselves out of business and pretend to be on the moral high ground with a whoa is me attitude about the whole thing. It makes me sick to see it transpiring before my eyes and not being able to do a thing about it.
