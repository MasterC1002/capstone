We need to talk. Lately, on subjects unrelated to their modifications. Comments about the size or shape of body parts, weight, body hair, etc.

**This will not be tolerated.**

People judge us for our modifications often enough. We are denied jobs, and being mean to each other is absurd.

**Effective immediately

One strike

To be clear, but ""Damn girl, your nose is all fucked up, don't draw attention to that,"" is not. We're not saying you have to be all kittens and rainbows and afraid to disagree with people, but we *are* saying you have to be constructive with your criticisms. 

If you see such a comment, but unfortunately, we can't be everywhere. Making this subreddit a better place requires you to help us out a little.

WHY WOULD YOU EVER DO SUCH AN AWFUL THING TO YOUR BODY? etc."" Then proceeds to tell me how I'm going to hell and that I should be ashamed of myself. She then storms off to find a manager who finishes her order because she refuses to let me get anywhere near her without screaming that I'm going to hell.

Me: Yeah

Guy: Well you got a stud in your tongue too?!

Me: Nope.

Guy: I bet I know where else you got a stud. (He raises his eyebrows at me)

Me: HAHAHAHAHAHAHA. That's quite an assumption. (I walk to the back

SIGH. 
Sorry guys.

As you may have noticed

Since removing the global NSFW tag means we also have to remove the 18+ restriction (and since there were so many people who voted not to remove the tag)

**Henceforth

* Any sexually suggestive images.

* All images of suspensions.

* Images of genital modifications

* Images of blood

* Images of fresh or healing scarification. 

* Images of modifications in progress. 

* Images of tattoos that depict violence or sexual material.

* Self posts discussing genital modifications

There will be situations where an image of a SFW piercing becomes NSFW. For instance

**What happens when you don't tag your post appropriately:**

* First offenders will get a warning

* On second offense

* If a user routinely neglects to tag their posts appropriately

Handling rule breakers in this way will be a trial run. If it becomes too much trouble for us to keep track of who's been warned how many times

Err on the side of safety with your tagging. If you're not sure whether or not something you want to post is NSFW

**As always, in order to ensure maximum visibility to all members of the community.**

**Edit:** I have turned off image thumbnails. Let me know how you feel about that.",,t5_2qj5t,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/bodymods/comments/pgsg9/nsfw_survey_results_and_new_rules/

First and foremost, and the tiny bit of extra space you get can do wonders, believe me.

Second, with a gnarly blowout on each one). Just take your time and listen to your body. The only part of having stretched ears that is supposed to hurt is when you get it pierced. The rest of the time, no pain whatsoever should be experienced. At the very most, it will be SLIGHTLY uncomfortable for a couple minutes when you put another layer of tape on your plugs. It is very important to listen to your body when stretching. If your ears feel sore at all, or if there are visible cuts on your ears, you need to stop immediately and wait a few days. Downsizing is your best friend. It might not seem like it because sometimes it can be unbearable to undo the progress you've made, but downsizing works magic on your ears. Not only do your ears get to relax, but your ear lobes will also get thicker if you downsize frequently. If you're always stretching up and don't take your plugs out or anything, you wouldn't go out for a run. So why would you keep stretching your ear lobes if they felt like shit? Just give them some time to recuperate. Trust me

Don't use sketchy shit as plugs/to stretch with. Anything that isn't made out of surgical grade stainless steal, or Teflon should not be going in your ears. That includes basically every kind of plastic in existence. Know how you can go in Hot Topic and buy a pair of 00g acrylic plugs for like, $14? DON'T DO IT. You would not believe how bad that shit is for your ear lobes! If you wear acrylic plugs for long enough, they will break down inside your ears. When the plugs do this, not only are poisonous fumes released into your skin, but the plugs themselves start to become porous, which in turn sucks the flesh of your ear into through a vacuum (on a microscopic level

When you're stretching at first it's ok to use tapers (simply to stretch with, but a lot of places don't recognize it as a necessity. The jump from 0g to 00g is even worse. So once you get around there, you'll want to start using PTFE Teflon tape to stretch. Simply put a layer of tape on the plugs every couple days and before you know it your ears will fit right on the next size plugs. I would stick with Teflon tape until you get to around 3/4"", then go to your local adult toy store or a Spencer's Gifts or something and get some non-adhesive bondage tape (also known as sex tape). The reason is because Teflon tape pretty much just comes in one size, and eventually the wearable surface on your plugs will start to become wider than the tape. Bondage tape is a little bit thicker than Teflon tape so you don't need to use as much of it, and it comes in a big fat roll that you can cut strips of to your liking. Teflon tape and bondage tape are pretty much the only things you should be using to tape your plugs with. You shouldn't use other kinds of tape because the adhesive is often toxic, and will irritate your ears a lot. Also, but the adhesive on the tape is just too much to risk. Plus, but with practice you'll get used to it. I always put 2 layers on initially to solidify the roll.

Get into the habit early on of letting your ears relax for a few hours a day. Take your plugs out in the shower, etc etc. As time goes on you'll be able to take your plugs out for longer intervals without them closing up too much, once they get used to it and their elasticity is improved. By the time you get to 1"" you should be able to leave your plugs out overnight with little consequence. Always keep backup pairs of plugs in the sizes just below where you're at because when you wake up, your ears will feel groggy and temperamental and won't want to go back to the size they're at. I always keep the next size lower just to throw in for the first few minutes of every day, pull on them a little, get my lobes ready and stretched enough to fit my actual size in. I like to use Jojoba oil to massage them with whenever I wake up or get out of a shower. Jojoba oil is chock full of vitamin E and other nutrients that moisturize, nourish and replenish your skin cells, and it also works as a great lubricant for putting your plugs in. You should be wary of the moisture of your ear lobes, but that bottle will last you for like, my ears actually got a little bit thinner. I might be wrong

That's mostly it. Maybe if I think of any other good stuff I'll edit this

Oh, but none of them are ""gauge"". End of discussion!

EDIT: a little more info on massaging with oils

I'm planning to keep my penis

Friday I'm getting an Apadravya. Its something I've wanted for the last few years and never got up the nerve to get it done. 

I've recently become good friends with a peircer in town and she has done all of my piercings the last few times I've gone in for them. And I used getting my nipples done as a judge of the pain I might feel with getting a body piercing down there. 

I'm just kinda trying to psych myself up to be ready. Pain really isn't the issue. I know I can handle the pain

I'm also getting my nipple piercings stretched up to 12g from 14g. Which will be interesting on its own.

I went last and decided on doing a swan dive/superman type position. I've recently become obsessed with skydiving and it made the most sense. Kaspa suggested doing an 8 point (upper back, but a willing sacrifice to the bodymod gods. We were a bit pressed for time so I was double teamed by both Kaspa and his lady/apprentice so Kaspa could start rigging. We moved the piercing table over to underneath the rig, I laid back down and they set to work. Got the tension adjusted nicely after setting up the shackles and clasps and away we went. 

I had expected a great outpouring of emotion and release but it was almost the exact opposite. Everything fell away and all that mattered was the hooks and the swinging and the bliss. I'm was up for about 20 minutes

The rush when I came back down was one of the best parts. That was the overwhelming flood of emotion that I had expected

Everything was healing normally until a few weeks ago when I noticed a crack where the ring went into my left nipple. At first I went back to my salt soak and cleaning ritual and put an end to any oral or physical contact. The crack was gross looking and the area around it was hard. It didn’t hurt at all though. Nothing I seemed to do helped though

I have no clue why I put it off so long now that it’s all over and done with. The piercer took a look and told me what she thought the problem was. She offered to put barbells in for me and gave me instructions on what to do. 48 hours later the crack is healing great. She didn’t even charge for the barbell (I gave her a nice tip though). She said it was a good thing I went in though because all sorts of problems could have occurred if I hadn’t (losing the piercing being the least of them). 

Please if you have any questions about a piercing be it about healing or anything else talk to a piercer. Piercers don’t mind answering questions as mine told me “I’m not just paid to do the piercing; I’m paid to answer questions and stand by my work too.” I see a lot of questions posted with a picture asking if something is healing right or if the redness/crustiness/whatever is normal.

So, but the actual procedure itself wasn't as hideous as I expected.  It was an extremely intense experience, but I wouldn't call it pain as such -- it was the sort of full-body feeling you get upon jumping into freezing water, but with the shock of first immersion somehow stretched to about 20 minutes in length.  About half-way through, I started to shake and twitch, and by the end I'd experienced a full-on endorphin rush.  There was little to no pain after the brand was complete.  I could drive quite happily with my seatbelt actually pressing on the wound site.  The smell, on the other hand... well.  The electrocautery device vapourises flesh, to say the least.  I met a few friends for a pint after the process

Healing it... yeah, and.. well, having to peel a dreadlock off the brand where it had gummed itself during the night was not a pleasant experience.  Because the area sees a **lot** of movement, it hurt mostly continuously for at least 10 days.  I've got a fairly high pain threshold, but I was chewing co-codamol like sweets.  It formed a huge, crusty scab in just under a week, which has finally almost completely flaked off now... with more than a little help from myself.  ([This](http://img40.imageshack.us/img40/9114/30415420494055290667710.jpg) is the scab in all its glory.  Sorry for picture's poor quality.) It's been approximately 3 days since the last of the pain from the area has receded.  I'd describe the healing process as considerably worse than my chest scarification (but you don't get the excruciating pain of the first shower with a brand!) and **much** more painful than any of my tattoos.  It has looked extremely unpleasant throughout its healing so far, as the redness seemed to be spreading for a few days -- but no

The skin around the brand is flaky and red at the moment -- makes me look rather like a mediaeval flagellant or leper.  Aftercare was minimal -- I was scrupulously careful about wound hygiene

So, it's healed brilliantly, and I've got great hopes for its appearance further down the road.  Because the electrocautery machine has variable settings + attachments, different parts of the scar are healing with different textures -- which is exactly what I wanted, so I'm quite happy!  The procedure itself was intense but bearable -- but the first two weeks of healing were an absolute sod.  Irritating pain was pretty much a constant, sleep involved positioning myself **just so** and trying to move as little as possible and the wound was producing a horrid-looking discharge for roughly a week that crusted to the nearest surface (so yeah, clean shirt before bed!).

Yeah.  Enough rambling from me.  Thanks for reading,,False,,t5_2qj5t,False,,True

Long story short, so when I went in to do groceries this evening he was leaving. I took it upon myself (being the friendly chatty cathy I am) to say hello and introduce myself as he was walking out for the day.


Well, didn’t that hurt?” I laughed it off and kept talking about how I only do very little casual jobs so I thought I would say hello while I have him free. He then asked “do you take your jewellery out when you come to work?” I feel I should say I do have a septum piercing (which I tuck up) and my lobes are at 36mm.  I tell him How I tuck the septum up and my ears would look funny without the jewellery to unsuspecting customers. 


Now here’s the kicker. He then asks me “Do you think if you didn’t have those piercings you would get more shifts?” Yeah, and even though it’s a slightly shit job, I am good at it! The only reason I don’t get many shifts is because I choose to as my new job is amazing (which I proceeded to let him know).

Hey body modditors!

I'm writing an essay for my Cyborg Society course about the connection between body modification and elective cyborgization. Essentially

My primary question is: **Why do you modify?** 

Other questions to consider

* Are you interested in the way new technologies allow for different body modifications (e.g. digital ink tattoos, etc.)? 
* Are you waiting for certain technologies to become safe in order to achieve a specific modification?
* Are your body mods integral to your personal sense of identity? 
* Do you see your body mods as an *improvement* upon yourself
* Would you consider getting a body mod that goes beyond human capabilities for non-health reasons (e.g. bionic eyes even though your eyes are perfectly healthy)? 
* Do you identify as a cyborg†

*not to imply that body mods are ""merely"" aesthetic

† technical definition of cyborg as an integration of organic and inorganic systems notwithstanding

Thanks for any input! I'm excited to hear some of your responses and see if they match up to my hypothesis.

http://www.reddit.com/r/bodymods/comments/utupj/tongue_splitbifurcation_after_2_weeks/

Saturday: Day 0

Appointment day.  Whilst wandering through the streets of an unfamiliar area of Brooklyn looking for the shop

Waited around

Told him I wanted it split back further than the 4g tongue ring I had in. But apparently I have absolutely no tongue webbing
He ended up numbing my tongue, but I would’ve wanted to kill myself during the suturing. And I’m a wuss when it comes to pain, so I guess I just liked not feeling anything while it was being done. 

So he cut, and sent me on my way.  

Walking back we stopped at a bunch of places asking for ice. If they gave us any trouble I just stuck my tongue out at them and they were like “JESUS

Sunday: Day 1

Not bad at all. I was surprised at how not-bad it was. A little bit of swelling
Went to a friends birthday party that night and spent the whole time sticking out my tongue to show people. Was a sad panda because I couldn’t drink. 

Monday: Day 2 

Holy mother of god. Woke up in wanting-to-kill-something pain. Upped the ibuprofen doses to 5 pills (instead of 4) at a time [disclaimer: don’t take this many ibuprofen at once]. 

Didn’t eat til like 7pm, then all was well. More ibuprofen, woohoo!!

Tuesday: Day 3 

	To go down in history as the tongue-split-healing-day-from-hell. Didn’t eat, which was even worse. So I was hot, hungry, in mortal danger, and my stomach was on fire from all the ibuprofen on an empty stomach. 

When I finally stumbled my ass into my house I used my mouthwash (biotine) and passed the fuck out.

Wednesday: Day 4

	Didn’t wake up til 11

Tried eating a microwaveable omelet  (cooled before eating, and did a longass saltwater rinse. 
Took out the 1 suture right at the tip of my tongue on the left side

Thursday: Day 5

Swelling went down

Took the frontmost pair of sutures out. 

Ate solid food for the first time! Just a few ham cubes &amp; cooked veggie mix

Friday: Day 6

Tried eating during the day

Conquered two, cut up in very small bites. But still, SUCCESS.

Took out all sutures except the back 4 (which are really close together). At this point I’d gotten pretty good at taking them out. Thursdays were a bit of a bitch

Saturday: Day 7

Felt pretty normal today

There were 4 sutures left in the very back of the split. I noticed one of them was on the top of my tongue somehow, I could see the loop. It was hardly in my tongue) I figured it might have migrated. Felt weird whenever I closed my mouth, because the loose bit of thread attached to the top of my tongue would tickle the roof of my mouth =P. Odd sensation, to say the least. Took that one out when I got home.

Later noticed there was a really loose one right at the bottom of my tongue too. That one hurt more
More solid fooddssss  =D. Everything still in really small bites

Was going to wait til Sunday to take out the last 2 back sutures. Partly because I’m lazy and didn’t want to do it that night, right side was completely out of my tongue &amp; just chillin back there somehow. 


Random words of advice: 
-Salt water rinses are fucking amazing 
-Sleep with your head propped up. I legit had all my pillows under me at all times
-The tips of my tongue were kind of numb because of the swelling. And taste was pretty non-existent til at least day 5-6; probably also due to the swelling.
-Food will be your biggest obstacle. Or at least it was for me.  
-Pain meds/anti-inflammatory meds were really easy to overdue. Watch for that

It was placed to sit fully on the pad but during healing it slipped lower toward the joint and slightly off to the side. I would definately recommend the lower aspect to anyone going for one in the future. It leaves the pad free of any problems when you pick things up normally  - like heavy boxes etc which otherwise would be quite tender.
The procedure was performed with a local so there was no pain but the first two weeks were like Hell. I havent had an injury before that managed to wake me from sleep when the pain meds ran out !!
It is now three months on and every thing is pretty cool. As many have said before the whole 'fields' thing is a little overblown but you can definately get a buzz every now and then.

1344358403.0,xtwy4,Idea for partial lobe reconstruction,AsgardGoddess,17,3,12,"www.i.imgur.com/a5iYl.jpg

I'd like to start off by saying the condition of my earlobe was not down to poor stretching or anything as such.

One winter, I know. But it worked. After they’d healed, I’d been left with this huge lump of scar tissue, but it was all healthy. I also managed to shrink the scar tissue to about 1/5 of the original size with daily oil massages and chamomile tea soaks. Later on I continued to stretch slowly with bondage tape, but usually it loosened so much each time, I could just place about 2-4mm bigger sizes straight in with no effort whatsoever. I got up to 2” and I also have bad blood circulation; but I massaged my lobes and has practically no problems with that. But then this winter is when the real problem happened. The cold makes your skin contract and it was pulling over my scar tissue and the skin was a tad thin because it was being pulled. Obviously the bigger the plugs, the heavier they are so with the cold, I then developed a split down the fistula about 1” long and 8mm wide. Naturally I took my plugs out and let it heal and have been downsizing since. It healed fine and the split shrunk from being 1” by 8mm to about 5mm by 5mm. Downsizing increases your blood flow (obviously) which made the bigger lump of scar tissue puff back out near to it’s original size. 

I’ve tried practically everything to thicken it

I've talked to a few artists about what should be done and what has been decided is that the thin part should be removed and have the two ends sewn together then have the fistula scalpelled to make it even again and maximizing comfort while wearing jewellery in the future. I'd be leaving my lobe at least a year after the procedure before I start stretching again; this time with a goal of 3"". It's all been arranged apart from the date as I have to travel miles and miles to a different city...country too.

I'll post about when I actually get it done as well.",,t5_2qj5t,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/bodymods/comments/xtwy4/idea_for_partial_lobe_reconstruction/

**Don't do what I did

I had first heard about magnetic implants in 2006

Recently

EDIT:I removed specifics for magnet supplier, and are coated in biocompatible parylene, the same stuff that goes on pacemakers and other medical implants.

I ordered #10 scalpels

I numbed my gloved finger by submersing it in a bag containing ice cubes, my finger was numb to a point midway up the first (closest to hand) digit. 

I made an incision 1/4"" long along the ""thumb side"" of my left middle finger

I attempted to place a suture

As blood flow was returning, and allowed a clot to form.

I wrapped my finger in gauze with tape. I drank some scotch and took some ibuprofen for pain management

**Don't do what I did

As my finger thawed, daily,along my finger, and I expect it to return in full within a few months (stupid, I know).Probing with external magnets was inconclusive.

Over the next few days, and further probing showed that the implant had migrated to a spot close to the incision. Attempts to re-position the implant with external magnets were unsuccessful.

Last night, and no further bleeding was evident.

Magnet is in position

I know I should have gone to a professional body mod artist in order to complete this procedure. However

I was extremely careful with preventing contamination during the whole process

I got my first cartilage piercings last July. Upper and middle in my left ear, but I still find them lovely. I am not a huge fan of how long the barbells are, either, as they seem to increase agitation by bumping into things behind my ear. I was more scared than I had been my first time and the pain was more intense but after about an hour things settled down to the typical dull ache. I did opt out of the tragus piercing I was planning to get on the same ear, but I have enough to heal as it is and I am content to wait a couple of months for that step. I had had enough pain for one day xD So in December or January I will have that done. Then I'll be looking at getting a daith in my left ear and a forward helix in my right ear to top things off. This is the vision I've been sketching out; I don't know if I will end up completing it yet, I'm just giving you guys the full picture of my plans.

I have always wanted a big back piece, after learning more about scarification I'm wondering if it would be possible to get a slightly raised portion underneath. I'm still very unfamiliar with the terminology of body modification so here goes nothing.

The next paragraph is the ideas behind the scarification/tattoo combo

What I'm looking for is a scarification that would best create a light raising of the skin (keloid?) to add some subtle definition to the tattoo. The scarification would be two lines about an inch or two away from my spine on either side with small cross lines through each of them (not crossing the spine). A sort of angel wings that have been amputated look. I'm very attached to fallen angel symbology and this would be a perfect undertone to my tattoo which is conglomeration of magical/occult symbols that are important to me and create a collage of my beliefs and life philosophies.

So on to the questions! (I hope I haven't bored or scared anyone off!)

1. First and foremost

2. Assuming it is indeed possible

3. What would be the best technique of scarification to use to create the slightly raised lines that I am looking for? It would be straight, hence the straight lines. I've done a little reading of techniques, I think a laser would work?

4. With these pieces being on my back and not a less flexible area of skin such as a forearm or calf

1) There's some scar tissue (or something) on the underside causing a little volcano-like protrusion. The offending tissue is a happy pink color. Oddly, pushing the piercing off-center. Not sure if it is blowout or migration or other. It will grow a little bit if agitated, and when I remove the jewelry for cleaning/salt soak/etc, it feels like the whole piercing wants to swell shut. There is no liquid coming from it aside from minor buildup of crusties. Any idea what this is? and is there any chance of getting rid of it or reducing it over time with massages, etc?

2) Sometimes, as if it were tearing tissue apart, but there is no blood or evidence of any damage. The piercing grips the jewelry rather tightly, so I not sure if it is drying out and losing lubrication, or if the small amount of dried crusty material that gathers is sharp enough to cause that kind of pain. In my most paranoid moments, I worry that there might be a metal splinter or something from the jewelry. Any thoughts on this?

No one where I live has a reputation, they workout of their garages for the most part. I do not mind having to travel for this procedure, but I do have a distance preferred. I'm willing to travel 6-10 hours from where I live in the Adirondack Mtns. Which means I am willing to go to the city, Canada

Any information at all is much appreciated and please, it wont change my decision, so don't waist your time trying to sway or insult me.

Thank in advance to anyone that responds.

I have a retainer in and my piercer said it is safe to flip it up and down as long as it's not a long. I keep it up around my house but sometimes feel like it is pushed too far up...Is this possible? It's still fresh and not healed so i can expect it's normal for it to feel tender. I am just wondering how i should go about maintaining this piercing other than trying sea salt soaks which seem to be very difficult.

i am also considering a tongue piercing a month down the line when i am healed and want personal experiences from people who have tongue piercings. I heard the swelling makes it difficult to speak..in what way? I don't expect it to be to bad. I am planning it a month before i start classes again so i should be able to talk but what is the average time for the swelling and how long should i expect to talk with a swollen funny tongue?

 What was the first thing that turned you on to body modification? 

Here is my story;

When I was.. I dunno, even though my ears were pierced, but I thought ""How could I commemorate him, and the way he died?"" And I thought for a while, slept on it and then looked at my mother. She had tattoos. One of them said ""In loving memory, Jared Paul."" (My stillborn would-be older brother.) And I thought that that was a very permanent way to remember something, or someone, and I wanted to relate also to my grandfathers suffering,' but means freedom in death.

Now I currently have several readily visible tattoos, sort of, helped me to get the job.  But they are an elderly couple and I have a sneaking suspicion that having a split tongue would be on the list of things that could cost me said job.  So my question is, after you get the process done, how obvious is it that you've had your tongue split while just having a conversation with someone?  During the healing process and after it is full healed.  Is it blatantly obvious without you actually making an effort to show someone that you have had your tongue split, or does it look fairly normal?

I typically fancy myself as someone who doesn't care what people think about me at first glance, ever so slightly, irresponsible for me not to look into the matter before really researching local (Or not so local) shops and such.

I can't find anything about double offset PAs, which would complete the theme, except one (expensive) wand and one random picture, and that gives me pause...  A regular PA is better than nothing, though.  A regular I'd prefer two dydoes at the top of the ridge, but I'm not quite sure it's high enough.  I'll have to talk to a piercer about that.  

Deep dydoes ain' happenin'.  I'm not doing any sort of zany double apadravya either.  Those both actually sound pretty rad, it's just a personal hangup.

The one that bothers me substantially is the hole left from my 10g triangle piercing. It was pierced at 10g right to start, all the time. I have tried lubing up the area with coconut-oil-based-salve, or plain jojoba oil, because i think friction itself might be part of the issue (i ride a bike almost every day and my labia is generally on the dryer side), but it's not curing it. Since it was pierced at 10g, i imagine there's some goo in there that would be nice to clean out. Do you have any suggestions for how to resolve this issue? It's just uncomfortable and distracting. I'm entertaining the idea of seeing if any jewelry will fit in there and maybe keeping a barbell in (i only ever tried various shapes of rings before) so at least it would be easier clean. Or perhaps just getting some tiny tapers to get in there and push out any buildup. I assume the hole is still open, or mostly open, but i have no idea.

I have a similar problem with my navel piercings, the skin part is white and stinks. Do you have any tricks for how to clean these up? I'm not as motivated to put jewelry in them or spend a lot of time/money cleaning them, because it's not as big of a problem as the triangle.

Ideally I want to just slide in the jewellery. Want to stay away from basically forcing it (tapers etc). I'm hoping the fistula has loosened over the year. When I get the jewellery gonna have a hot bath and see. Won't have the jewellery until maybe late January.
