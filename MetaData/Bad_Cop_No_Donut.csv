In the military we conduct what are called safety stand down days. Essentially all work stops and we conduct safety related classes. On one of these several months ago

This didn't sit well with me

Mind you, Non-Commissioned Officers (NCOs) and Commissioned Officers.
Me:""Sir, which set a precedence for the nation in free speech and vulgar language, one of the justices said ""the state may not, consistently with the first and fourteenth amendments, make the simple public display of this single four letter (the ""F"" one if you were wondering) expletive a criminal case."" He also said ""...states cannot censor their citizens in order to make a ""civil"" society."" Also, the Constitution is at the federal level and trumps state laws, including this one. How does texas think it can violate this, what law does Texas have that says this?"" 

At this point all I heard was a waft of ""OOOOhhhhh....daaamn."" And other laments of disbelief and ownage. 

The cop's only response was ""you can try it (to swear in public)...but don't mess with Texas.""

I was flabbergasted. My jaw dropped open. All of that for a "" don't mess with Texas"" response. The look on his face was fantastic and well worth it. The sheer surprise and shock of someone standing up to him. 

As he left I bushwhacked him some more

This wen't on and on and on. Everything he said I was able to shoot down with a quickness. I finally got sick of arguing with this sorry, ""When injustice becomes law, resistance becomes duty."" You remember that."" And I walked off.

I publicly embarrassed a state pig who had been with the force for 20 years in front of my entire, battalion. I found out later my Battalion Commander (A Lieutenant Colonel) and my Brigade Commander (a Colonel) were in the audience at the back. I had everyone from Privates to Captains come up to me during the rest of the day and give me a pat on the back, agreeing with me 100%.

He's not done fighting and what he's doing with the money could cost Seattle millions.",FritzMuffknuckle,379,114,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut/comments/osywn/eric_rachner_wins_another_battle_in_the_war_he_is/

Eric has a strong interest in civil rights and is well versed in law.  Officer Michele Letizia and the SPD not so much. I've posted a relatively brief summary of how this all began in the comments below and here's a [good article from 2010](http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/Local-computer-security-expert-investigates-887914.php#page-1) if you enjoy a long read. Seriously

Seattle PD has created a catch-22 system under their interpretation of a Washington *privacy law* they claim forbids the release of dashcam video until the statute of limitations has expired for cases of police misconduct. They continue to withhold video

Eric has taken the transaction logs of videos on the police system he received in his case against the SPD dating from July 2008 through August 2011 and [created a web site searchable by anyone](http://seattlepolicevideo.com/) to find out if they have been denied videos. Even without the actual video

As Eric's attorney Cleveland Stockmeyer put it, I don't know. But I tell you we're going to freaking find out."" 

Keep in mind that the [US DOJ started their investigation of the SPD](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2017026414_doj16m.html) after Eric's arrest. I don't know how much he worked with the DOJ

Eric works with news reporters to uncover video that might support cases they are investigating and is assisting one news station in their [lawsuit against the SPD for breaking state public records law](http://www.komonews.com/news/local/130138973.html) and denying public access to the videos.

Here's the strange thing though, SPD [Chief John Diaz hired an outside attorney to oversee an investigation](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2017052223_spdinvestigator20m.html) into confidential information leaked to the news media. The SPD eventually turned over one video of this incident to the DOJ though Eric determined there were several more they didn't.

Dashcam videos that have recently surfaced:

*  [Teen tazed and arrested for ""lipping off"" when he told police they had no legal authority to demand his ID](http://www.komonews.com/news/local/Attorneys-SPD-dash-cam-video-shows-unnecessary-use-of-force-137328443.html?tab=video&amp;c=y). This type of case will easily hit a large settlement amount.

* [Officers mock Seattle jogger nearly killed by a truck](http://grist.org/list/2011-12-21-cops-mock-seattle-jogger-nearly-killed-by-a-truck/).

* [Officer Ian Birk shoots and kills homeless woodcarver just seconds after getting out of his car](http://www.komonews.com/news/local/120993149.html?tab=video&amp;c=y).

* [Two undercover officers yank an innocent man from his car and beat him](http://www.kirotv.com/news/news/seattle-officers-just-yank-em-comment-raises-quest/nFjdq/).

* [Officer Kevin Oshikawa-Clay slams a compliant man's head into the hood of his patrol car](http://www.komonews.com/news/local/120521724.html).

* [Officer Garth Haynes kicks the face of cuffed man laying on the ground](http://www.komonews.com/news/local/115682874.html?tab=video&amp;c=y).

Three of the videos claim to have been obtained exclusively by the news station while the others do not disclose how the video was made available. I have read that Eric helped determine what video was available in two cases and suspect his hand in more. My guess is reporters ask him to identify which videos they need and then use their own sources inside the SPD to get a copy.

It's a sad state of affairs when people have to rely on Eric and news reporters to get evidence they have a right to. These cases will continue to rack up big settlements until Seattle

Police Overkill

By ROBERT KAHN 

Wednesday

Courthouse News Service 


BALTIMORE (CN) - When an architect crashed his car while suffering a diabetic reaction on the way home from Bible study class

Linda Johnson sued the Maryland State Police, 2010.

Johnson suffered a diabetic attack sometime after 8:15 p.m. that night

He suffered a diabetic attack

According to the complaint, Parker pepper sprayed him in the face.

Johnson then got out of his car and Parker clubbed him at least once in the knee. Defendant Officer Loss (fnu) then arrived and whacked Johnson at least twice with his club

Baltimore County Police Officer Nicholas Wolferman then arrived,"" Johnson's widow says.

She claims the very first officer on the scene knew or should have known that her husband was suffering from a medical problem.

Nonetheless, she says. Three more cops arrived, including Baltimore County Officer Andrew O'Neill, who Tasered Johnson twice. Officer Loss then punched him in the face and the six officers managed to handcuff him, the widow says.

Eight more cops arrived, the cops forcibly held him down, though he was not resisting, and was handcuffed, his wife says.

""Upon information and belief

The widow claims Johnson was Tasered at least three times, surrounded by police. He became ""motionless and speechless"" and was pronounced dead within an hour of cardiac arrest.

He was the 10th person to die since 2004 after being subjected to police electroshock in Maryland

Linda Johnson seeks more than $10 million in punitive damages for wrongful death, false arrest, battery, gross negligence and other charges. She is represented by Mark Millstein and David Silbiger, both of Baltimore. ",,False,t5_2qqdb,True

*****

Yesterday (5.26.2012), WA PD officer W. B. Corson (Badge number 0575, Cruiser number 1529) pulled me over while riding my bicycle. I immediately got out my phone and attempted to record the traffic stop using [Qik](http://www.qik.com). The officer asked what I was doing, and when I explained that I was recording him, he threatened me with illegal arrest under the state recording law. I presume he was referring to [RCW 9.73.030](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9.73.030), but that does not apply because RCW 9.73.030 only restricts recording *private* communication where the parties have not given consent. There is no expectation of privacy in public. Furthermore, Courts of Appeals in multiple circuits and the Department of Justice have said that recording the police in public is a first amendment right.

[**Here is a link to the video.**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71abF8uzW7Q) After I stopped recording, and gave me a warning for breaking two laws that did not apply (more below). In fact, the officer originally wasn't going to tell me what laws I had allegedly violated and I had to press him for him to even write it on my warning citation. My drivers license was also demanded (again after I protested), even though I was not operating a motor vehicle.

~~My question is: **How do I find a lawyer?** Would I be better off contacting the ACLU? I plan to file an official complaint with Redmond PD

**edit** I have been in contact with Redmond PD and am hopeful that the internal affairs process can resolve this case to my satisfaction.

*****

(If you're not interested in why I was pulled over

Circumstances of the traffic stop: I was riding my bicycle with 2 friends on Cleveland Street, and my other two friends on the right side of the same lane, one in front of the other (all of this is legal). The officer warned me for ""impeding traffic,"" under [RCW 41.61.425](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=46.61.425) (which doesn't apply because Cleveland Street isn't a single lane per direction, there is another lane to pass), and [RCW 41.61.427](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=46.61.427) (which doesn't apply because a bicycle is not a motor vehicle). I was also cited for not riding on the right side of the lane, but [that RCW](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=46.61.770) has a safety exception. Riding to the far right side of the lane is not safe because cars can and will attempt to pass in the same lane. That RCW also explicitly allows people to ride two-abreast in the lane
