I decided to rely heavily on what I know about current political unions


In Asia, and Japan regained some of its former Empire. Earlier in the century, Mongolia discovered a treasure trove of mineral resources which jump started its economy. A South East Asian Union (ASEAN) emerges in response to China's territoriality. After a brief nuclear exchange in the 2030's, India claims Pakistan as part of its territory. Bangladesh unionizes with India after it receives heavy aid as a result of dramatic climate change ravaging the country.


In the Middle East, and partly in response to a dramatically more powerful Turkish Union, a Caliphate is created to run a Pan-Arabic Union. It started with the countries of the Arabic Peninsula, and slowly spreads through North Africa, and the rest of the Levant.

The EU has finally federalized after adding a few more countries and sorting out the financial crisis earlier in the century. The Scandinavian  Union forms purely due to their unique liberal social policies.

The East African Federation is formed in 2018. In the rest of Africa, and Greater South Africa.

In the Americas, the Caribbean States of America are formed out of Central America and the Caribbean. Mexico, over the years has seriously developed economically; even rivaling the United States and Canada. As a gesture of goodwill, and due to changing ethnic backgrounds of the American Southwest, Southern California (south of LA), Arizona, New Mexico

- The Arab peoples are tired of war, MB, Nationalism &amp; Soviet Socialism
- Israel has continued further domination of the region through economic growth
- The federation includes Israel as a continued Jewish state
- Oil has mostly run out or is obsolete with modern technology needs

Some things to answer: 
- How would this come about?
- When is this breakthrough made?
- Does the Federation have an official religion per state? 
- How strong is the Federal Govt versus the local 'state'?
- Is there a 'capitol' similar to Washington DC? 
- Is freedom of movement/living between the states allowed?
- What does the military look like?
- What country(s) would be the primary opposition/rivals? 

Discuss! I want some good stories!

**I'm asking what this could imply - how this data could be used etc. What do you think ?** (&lt;- tl;dr)

----

**Further explanation**: computer games/virtual realities are getting enhanced day after day. Just look at the development of games in 10years and now think further (maybe 50years) and the rather exponentional rate of this development. We will have virtual realities that are close to actual reality without a doubt. Now what if people could monitor all your psychological reactions there ? There are many ways how this could be done but I'm more speaking of the game just coming with that inbuilt. It could forward every input from the user that it gets; and virtual realities get more and more input. By now for some inputs games have is where you look with the mouse etc.  
As written I actually thought about this when playing Far Cry 3 and there was a mission in which there was a guy (whose business you plan to infiltrate) explaining his global product (could be seen as Far Cry 3 the game) and that there is a camera in the characters' eyes (you the player

And as writing I thought about one implication: what if virtual realities become so used and so complex&amp;detailed [eventually even merging with reality ingame much like in [""Surrogates""](https://youtube.com/watch?v=UGwQ74cH5O0)] that people spend most of their time in them and the analysation of the data is done by AI.

Question: Say Great Britain or Honshu (the islands of the UK/Japan with the vast majority of the population) were to have their populations suddenly reduced to percentage points of their present amount or completely wiped out (without affecting anything else) how would this affect:

•	Sovereignty

Would the smaller islands (by population) that also form the countries be able to retain their right to the govern that area / how would the international community react to the smaller government of these countries

•	Assets

what would happen to the countries vast assets? everything from vehicles to high end electronics would be easy to come by in these countries, etc.)

•	Production capability

would things like oil refineries and any other examples of internationally important facilities come under temporary management (importing workers / resources) until other countries can build to fill the demand left by the loss of their production capabilities

•	Militarily

how would the assets of their respective military s be handled especially navies (and especially in regards to the UK) I'm assuming navies would be largely unaffected by the disaster as they are ships and therefore weren't infected

•	please note: I know that a biological reason for wiping out the population would lead to quarantine / rotting bodies etc. so can we try to work around that in order to give us an essentially abandoned Island civilisation

**2014** – Scottish Independence is defeat at the polls.


**2020's** – United Kingdom hold referendum about staying in the EU. Euro-sceptic Conservatives along with UKIP MP's manage to sway the vote against and UK leaves the EU.


**2030's** – British Government establish better trade within the Commonwealth of Nations.


**2045** – Argus Industries based in London unveil a new product. A small scale Thorium Nuclear Reactor. About the size of a semi-truck it can power whole cities. London suddenly becomes awash with money. They have clean


**2045 to 2046** – Over the next 18 months oil prices plummet as hundreds of Thorium Reactors roll off the assembly lines into India, but the fact that all oil was traded in US dollars let her expand like no other nation in history. What the British did though just about destroyed the USA. Within 18 months the price of oil had dropped to a shadow of its former self. That was when the problems began... for everyone. Massive lay off began in the oil sector and went through to the automotive, coal and other sectors of the economy like wildfire. 


**Oct 16 2046** – The US dollar drops 50% in one day causing the US to fall into a depression.


**2046 to 2047** – With the US in a depression the rest of the world economy begins to collapse. Riots, freight, railways and even cities begin to shut down. People can't get paid, pensions or savings. World trade grinds to a halt.


**2047** – China goes into a full revolution. Few news breaches the Silk Curtain as the Politburo try to suppress the revolution and show the world everything is fine. In reality dark and horrific rumours come out from behind the Silk Curtain. Things like human meat being cheaper than pork. Russia is facing the same problems as their economy was propped up on oil and gas exports. 


**2046 – 2050** Many other countries are suffering riots


**2051** – The US enters a Second Civil War as the states west of the Rocky Mountains secede from the Federal Government and establish their own country of Pacifica. The southern “Confederate” states secede later in the year forming the Confederate States of America. Britain is sending some aid along with some other countries but it will be years before the US is whole again. Britain is offering citizenship to the rich


**2052** – The Commonwealth of Nations holds a trade summit in Ottawa, Australia, India, New Zealand, South Africa, UK, Singapore form the core nations. They form a single currency union unsurprisingly called the Pound and remove trade barriers between countries of the Commonwealth. 


**2053 to 2057** – The Commonwealth of Nations hold originally seemed to be tenuous as there was political and cultural differences between the core nations. After a transition period it begins to settle and the Commonwealth Parliament decides to impose order on other member states of the Commonwealth who haven't officially signed up to the new Parliament. Bolstered by recruits from the Indian sub continent, against the European Union. Lead by France and Germany the European Union weathered the “Dark Years” better than most other powers eventually became the political bloc it was long expected to become.

""Greetings fellow architects, and scallywags. I’ve long since joining this sub considered when the right time would be to submit my creation for the ogling eyes of the community to critique and consider, but have since come to the conclusion that well, fuck it all, the time is now you little bitch. So posthaste, I submit to you a world so hot off the iron presses, it could very well sear your fingertips right off.

I’ll preface her with a bit of background. Earth: 2043. The planet’s oil supply has essentially been run dry. The once great nations of man have been brought to their knees by a societal collapse, while fending off the ruthless nature of their new world. As in any state of crisis, there are those who take advantage of the misfortunes of collapsing regulation. Inhabiting the crumbling metropolic forests once home to the bustling traffic and towering corporations of a doomed society, the lawless are those very individuals who bask in the plight of their fellow man, seizing and claiming both property and life as they see fit. But that’s not the only threat to safety here in the naughty 40’s, Ace. It may be marginally difficult, but totally possible, however, in a wild galactic game of whack-a-mole

Raining meteorites have become a highly common danger among the slew of threats around the globe. Having been dispatched from their motherly orbit in large quantity, and the like. As ominous as the possibility of being squashed by a boulder may be, even more so is meeting eyes with its mother in the night’s sky, watching as it slides gently around the planet, both leading and following a trail of its children in parade. This was no act of God, though. No. This was a plague brought about by the greed and desperation of man. Seeking to extract a heaven-sent source of limitless power from within, a mining operation was begun and the behemoth engaged, however

This caused widespread panic and disorder, townships, and community alliances. Others who prefer to live alone have taken to forests, bayous, hotels, and all sorts of other imaginative retreats to make living a bit more manageable. This sort of variation may just be the only way to outlive the bind long enough to have a chance at rebuilding what was once taken for granted. But this is life. This is the New Earth. ""

September 30, they sucsessfully intercept five ICBMs launched from Kwajelin Atoll in the Pacific Ocean. The test system is named SHILD, or Super High Intercontinental Laser Defense.

2031: Further tests of SHILD continue. A SHILD rapid-fire laser cannon mounted on a nuclear submarine sucsessfully intercepts another ICBM fired from Kwaj, but cannot discover the sources of the intercepts. Rumors fly around the world of a new American superweapon. The US government denies all existence of the program, although evidence starts to mount of SHILD's existence.

June 16, Alaska, Hawaii, and American bases abroad.

July 22, finally reaching their breaking point, go to war over the Senkaku/Dioyu Islands, kicking off a major war. The situation quickly escalates. USAF satellite recon indicates that the Chinese nuclear force is mobilizing, and intercepted transmissions indicate that they are preparing to attack Japan, South Korea, the Phillipines, and American casualties would be minimal. The reality sets in: The US would be able to attack China with a full blown nuclear strike without fear of retaliation.

July 22, and the American nuclear force is out on DEFCON 1.
