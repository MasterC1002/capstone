My father couldn't get over the quality of the ""studio sound"" I like to say. As someone who used to go to Studio 54 in its heyday

He instantly got into the great licks from Nile Rodgers

My mother was a little tougher to get into it for some songs. But I loved seeing her start to sing ""Lose Yourself To Dance"" over and over as I saw it get stuck into her head like it already has in mine. 

Finally

First, but turn the music louder and start dancing all over the room. He said it made him feel like he was back in the old dance clubs again. I really wish I had gotten a chance to record it. 

Secondly, much like my father had earlier.

edit 2: I was a periwinkle

edit 3: I leave to write a 3 hour exam and I come back to this. I am now kind of nervous to be the spokesperson of team ""fake, just to test the waters to see if anyone would leak it outright. It would both help still the waters that the hype has created by allowing some people to lower their expectations, and give good cover for premiering the real deal. I just can't ignore the extra guitar parts in collaborators vid's, the lack of any real nile's groovin, the poorly produced nature of it all, poor transitions, and that 6 seconds of weird synth at the end.

The Daft Punk marketing team thus far has gone above and beyond any album campaign in a decade with the key aspect being a locked down album, but as a periwinkle, and as a daft punk fan, I say the robots are up to something glorious. My dream might be shattered tonight at 10 pm my time, but half the fun of this whole journey has been speculation and debate! Let's hope for the best, and even worst case scenario the robots will have 68 more minutes to get the rest of us dancin, hell I might even listen to this fake if I find myself staring out at a beach in my car

See you all tonight!

It's been an incredible journey since the rumors, scanning the internet for the small piece of information, staying up all night listening to radios, sometimes disappointment...

The past year of my life has been dreadful. I've failed multiple classes in college. I've lost all of my drive. I was rejected by the only girl I ever had any feelings for. I lost some good friends and don't even talk to them anymore. I broke my humerus and lost 7 months of hard work in the gym. I have an undiagnosed issue with my spleen and lower intestines. I've scrambled for cash for much of the year. All of my friends graduated and moved away


I've been so

**The Game of Love**  
*(Intro)*  
There is a game of love  (x2)  
This is a game of love (x2)  
And it was you  (x2)  
The one that would be breaking my heart  
When you decided to walk away (x2)  
*(Bridge)*  
The one that would be breaking my heart  
When you decided to walk away (x2)  
*(Bridge)*  
There is a game of love  (x2)  
This is a game of love (x2)  
And it was you  (x2)  
The one that would be breaking my heart  
When you decided to walk away  
When I wanted you to stay  
(Ooooooo....)  
And it was you  
I just wanted you to stay  
Me

**Giorgio by Moroder**  
*(Narration by Giorgio)*  
""When I was 15, I definitely wanted to become a musician. It was almost impossible, because it was-- the dream was so big, that I didn't see any chance, because I was living in a little town-- I was studying. And when I finally broke away from school and became a musician, I thought 'Well, now I may have a little bit of a chance.' Because all I really wanted to do is music, but compose music.""

""At that time in Germany, they had already discotheques. So I would take my car, would go to a discotheque, sing maybe 30 minutes, I think I had about 7-8 songs. I would partially sleep in the car, because I didn't want to drive home. And that helped me for about almost 2 years to survive, in the beginning.""

""I wanted to do an album with the sounds of the 50s, and then have **a** sound of the future. And I said 'Wait, a second-- I know the synthesizer, why don't I use the synthesizer, which IS the sound of the future.' And I didn't have any idea what to do, but I knew I needed a click, so we put the click on the 24 track

""My name is Giovanni Giorgio
*(Epic stuff for awhile)*  
""Once you free your mind about a concept of harmony and of music being 'correct', and there was no preconception of what to do.""  
*(More epic stuff til song end)*  

**Within**  
*(Intro)*  
*(Verse 1)*  
There are so many things that I don't understand  
There a world within me that I cannot explain  
Many rooms to explore
I am lost
*(Chorus x2)*  
I've been for some time  
Looking for some one  
I need to know now  
please tell me who I am?  
*(Verse 2)*  
There are so many things that I don't understand  
There's a world within me that I cannot explain  
Many rooms to explore
I am lost
*(Chorus x4)*  
I've been for some time  
Looking for some one  
I need to know now  
please tell me who I am?  

**Instant Crush (feat. Julian Casablancas)**  
EDIT: This one is HARD. Suggestions are welcome. Anything with a (?) I am unsure about.

*(Intro)*  
*(Verse 1)*  
I didn't want to be the one to forget  
I thought of everything I'd never regret  
A little time with you is all that I get  
That's all we need because it's all we can take  

One thing I never see the same when you're 'round
I don't believe in him - his lips on the ground
I want to take you to that place in the ""Roche""  
But nobody gives us any time any more  

He asked me once if I'd look in on his dog  
You made an offer for it
I got this picture of us kids in my head  
And all I hear is the last thing that you said:  

*(Bridge)*  
'I listened to your problems
I didn't want to anymore (Oh...)

*(Chorus)*  
And we will never be alone again  
Cause it doesn't happen every day  
Kinda counted on you being a friend  
Can I give it up or give it away 

Now I thought about what I want to say   
But I never really know where to go  
So I chained myself to a friend  
Cause I know it unlocks like a door  

And we will never be alone again  
Cause it doesn't happen every day  
Kinda counted on you being a friend  
Can I give it up or give it away 

Now I thought about what I want to say   
But I never really know where to go  
So I chained myself to a friend
Some more again...

*(Verse 2)*  
It didn't matter what they wanted to see  
He thought he saw someone that looked just like me  
The summer memory that just never dies  
We worked too long and hard to give it no time  

He sees right through me
Cracks in the road that I would try and disguise  
He runs his scissor at the seam in the wall  
He cannot break it down or else he would fall  

*(Bridge)*  
One thousand lonely stars  
hiding in the cold  

Take it

*(Guitar Break)*  
*(Bridge)*  
'I listened to your problems
I didn't want to anymore (Oh...)

*(Chorus)*  
And we will never be alone again  
Cause it doesn't happen every day  
Kinda counted on you being a friend  
Can I give it up or give it away 

Now I thought about what I want to say   
But I never really know where to go  
So I chained myself to a friend  
Cause I know it unlocks like a door  

And we will never be alone again  
Cause it doesn't happen every day  
Kinda counted on you being a friend  
Can I give it up or give it away 

Now I thought about what I want to say   
But I never really know where to go  
So I chained myself to a friend  
Cause I know it unlocks like a-

I don't understand
I'm not with you  
We're swimming around

*(Chorus x2)*  
And we will never be alone again  
Cause it doesn't happen every day  
Kinda counted on you being a friend  
Can I give it up or give it away 

Now I thought about what I want to say   
But I never really know where to go  
So I chained myself to a friend  
Cause I know it unlocks like a door

**Touch (feat. Paul Williams)**  
*(Spacey Intro with Robot Voice)*  
Touch. Touch-- I remember touch.  
Touch. Touch-- I remember touch.  
Where do I belong?  
Touch. I need something more.  
I remember touch. I need something more in my mind.  

*(Paul Williams Verse)*  
Touch. I remember touch.  
Pictures came with touch
A tourist in a dream
a half-forgotten song
Tell me what you see

*(beat drops)*  
Kiss suddenly alive
hunger like a storm
A room within room
Touch
Tell me what you see

*(Strings
*(Spacey slow-down)*  
Home

*(Spacey break, choral)*  
Home

*(Outro)*  
Touch
you've give me too much to feel  
Sweet touch

Like the legend of the phoenix (ha)
What keeps the planet spinning (ah)
*(Bridge)*  
We've come too far to give up who we are  
So let's raise the bar
*(Chorus)*  
She's up all night til the sun  
I'm up all night to get some

*(Bridge)*  
We've come too far to give up who we are  
So let's raise the bar
*(Chorus x3)*  
She's up all night til the sun

**Beyond**  
*(Epic String Intro)*  
*(Verse)*  
Dream
beyond life
Before sound
close your eyes and rise.  
Higher still
to the land of love.  
Beyond love
angel eye
You are the night
You are the light behind a cloud  
You are the end and the beginning  
A world where time is not allowed  
There's no such thing as competition  
To find our way
Remember
This is a journey of the soul  
The perfect song is framed with silence  
It speaks of places never seen  
Your home's a promise long forgotten  
It is the birthplace of your dreams  
*(Outro)*

**Motherboard**  
(Instrumental

**Fragments of Time (feat. Todd Edwards)**  
*(Intro)*  
*(Verse)*  
Driving this road down to paradise  
Letting the sunlight into my eyes
Our only plan is to improvise  
And it's crystal clear that I don't ever want it to end  
If I had my way I would never leave  
keep building these random memories  
turning our days into melodies  
but since I can't stay...
*(Chorus x2)*  
I'll just keep playing back  
these fragments of time  
everywhere I go
*(Verse)*
Familiar faces I've never seen  
living the gold and the silver dream  
making me feel like i'm seventeen  
And it's crystal clear that I don't ever want it to end  
If I had my way I would never leave  
keep building these random memories  
turning our days into melodies  
but since I can't stay...  
*(Chorus x2)*  
I'll just keep playing back  
these fragments of time  
everywhere I go
*(Guitar &amp; Disco Break)*  
*(Chorus)*  
I'll just keep playing back  
these fragments of time  
everywhere I go
I'll just keep playing back  
these fragments of time  
these moments will shine 


**Doin' it Right (feat. Panda Bear)**  
*(Vocoder Repeated Throughout
Doin' it right  
Everybody will be dancing and we'll be feeling it right  
Everybody will be dancing and be doin' it right
Everybody will be dancing and we're feeling alright  
Everybody will be dancing tonight  
*(Verse x2)*  
If you do it right
shadows on you break out into the light  
*(Chorus)*  
If you lose your way tonight  
that's how you know the magic's right  
*(Vocoder 1x before Panda Bear
Doin' it right  
Everybody will be dancing and we'll be feeling it right  
Everybody will be dancing and be doin' it right
Everybody will be dancing and we're feeling alright  
Everybody will be dancing tonight  
*(Verse x2)*  
If you do it right
shadows on you break out into the light  
*(Chorus x2)*  
If you lose your way tonight  
that's how you know the magic's right  
*(Synth Break)*  
*(Verse x4)*  
If you do it right
shadows on you break out into the light  
*(Chorus x4)*  
If you lose your way tonight  
that's how you know the magic's right

Just turn on the music
Let the music of your life
Give life back to music

**THE GAME OF LOVE**

There is a game of love
There is a game of love
This is a game of love
This is a game of love

And it was you
And it was you
The one that would be breaking my heart
When you decided to walk away
When you decided to walk away

There is a game of love
There is a game of love
This is a game of love
This is a game of love

And it was you
And it was you
The one that would be breaking my heart
When you decided to walk away
When I wanted you to stay

And it was you
I just wanted you to stay
Me I just wanted you to stay
Me I just wanted you to stay
Me I just wanted you to stay

**WITHIN**

There are so many things
that I don't understand
There's a world within me
that I cannot explain
Many rooms to explore
but the doors look the same
I am lost I can't even remember my name

I've been for sometime
Looking for someone
I need to know now
Please tell me who I am

There are so many things
that I don't understand
There's a world within me
that I cannot explain
Many rooms to explore
but the doors look the same
(where are the locks to try the key)
I am lost I can't even remember my name
(and I wonder why)

I've been for sometime
Looking for someone
I need to know now
Please tell me who I am

I've been for sometime
Looking for someone
I need to know now
Please tell me who I am

**INSTANT CRUSH**

I didn't want to be the one to forget
I thought of everything I'd never regret
A little time with you is all that I got
That's all we need because its all we can take

One thing I never see the same when your 'round
I don't believe in him - his lips on the ground
I wanna take you to that place on the ""Roche""
But no one gives us any time anymore

He ask me once if I'd look in on his dog
You made an offer for it then you ran off
I got this picture of us kids in my head
And all I hear is the last thing that you said

'I listened to your problems
Now listen to mine'
I didn't want to anymore

And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away

Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
'Cause I know it unlocks like a door

It didn't matter what they wanted to see
He thought he saw someone that looked just like me
The summer memory that just never dies
We worked too long and hard to give it no time

He sees right through me it's so easy with lies
Cracks in the road that I would try and disguise
He runs his scissor at the seem in the wall
He cannot break it down or else he would fall

1000 lonely stars
Take it

'I listened to your problems
Now listen to mine'
I didn't want to anymore

And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away

Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
'Cause I know it unlocks like a door...

I don't understand
We're swimming around
when I'm with you

**LOSE YOURSELF TO DANCE**

I know you don't get a chance to take a break this often
I know your life is speeding and it isn't stopping
Here take my shirt and just go ahead
and wipe up all the
Sweat! Sweat! Sweat!

Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance

Come on, come on
Come on, come on

Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance

Everybody's dancing on the floor
Getting ready for more

Everybody on the floor
Everybody on the floor

Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance

**TOUCH**

Touch
I remember touch
Pictures came with touch
A painter in my mind
Tell me what you see

A tourist in a dream
A visitor it seems
A half forgotten song
Where do I belong
Tell me what you see
I need something more

Kiss
Suddenly alive
Happiness arrive
Hungry like a storm
How do I begin
A room within a room
A door behind a door
Touch
I need something more
Tell me what you see
I need something more

If love is the answer you're home
Hold on
If love is the answer you're home
Hold on
If love is the answer you're home

Touch
Sweet touch
You've given me too much to feel
Sweet touch
You've almost convinced me I'm real

I need something more
I need something more

**GET LUCKY**

Like the legend of the Phoenix
All ends with beginnings
What keeps the planet spinning
The force from the beginning

We've come too far
To give up who we are
So let's raise the bar
And our cups to the stars

She's up all night to the sun
I'm up all night to get some
She's up all night for good fun
I'm up all night to get lucky

We're up all night to the sun
We're up all night to get some
We're up all night for good fun
We're up all night to get lucky

We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky

The present has not ribbon
Your gift keeps on giving
What is this I'm feeling
If you want to leave I'm with it

We've come too far
To give up who we are
So let's raise the bar
And our cups to the stars

She's up all night to the sun
I'm up all night to get some
She's up all night for good fun
I'm up all night to get lucky

We're up all night to the sun
We're up all night to get some
We're up all night for good fun
We're up all night to get lucky

We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky

**BEYOND**

Dream
Beyond dream
Beyond life
You will find
Your

Song
Before sound
To be found
Close your eyes
And

Rise
Higher still
Endless thrill
To the land
Of

Love
Beyond love
Come alive
Angel Eye
Forever watching you and I

You are the night
You are the ocean
You are the light behind a cloud
You are the end and the beginning
A world where time is not allowed

There's no such thing as a competition
To find our way we lose control
Remember love's our only mission
This is a journey of the soul

The perfect song is framed with silence
It speaks of places never seen
Your home's a promise long forgotten
It is the birthplace of your dreams

**FRAGMENTS OF TIME**

Driving this road down to paradise
Letting the sunlight into my eyes
Our only plan is to improvise
And it's crystal clear
That I don't ever want it to end

If I had my way
Keep holding these random memories
Turning our days into melodies
But since I can't stay

I'll just keep playing back
These fragments of time
Everywhere I go
These moments will shine

I'll just keep playing back
These fragments of time
Everywhere I go
These moments will shine

Familiar faces I've never seen
Living the gold and the silver dream
Making me feel like I'm seventeen
And it's crystal clear
That I don't ever want it to end

If I had my way
Keep holding these random memories
Turning our days into melodies
But since I can't stay

I'll just keep playing back
These fragments of time
Everywhere I go
These moments will shine

I'll just keep playing back
These fragments of time
Everywhere I go
These moments will shine

**DOIN' IT RIGHT**

Doin' it right
Everybody will be dancing
And we'll be feeling it right
Everybody will be dancing
And be doin' it right
Everybody will be dancing
When we're feeling all right
Everybody will be dancing tonight

If you do it right
Let it go all night
Shadows on you break
Out into the light

If you lose your way tonight
That's how you know the magic's right
If you lose your way tonight
That's how you know the magic's right",self,t5_2qtn5,1368726050.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/DaftPunk/comments/1efv04/official_ram_lyrics/

Hey! I'm Jake

Last year I started a project called Alive 2012. I was gonna mash up every DP track from their studio albums into an ""ideal"" DP live show. I got pretty well into it

Now that RAM is out

Alive 2013 will feature **every** Daft Punk Album track from Homework to RAM, Tron tracks, etc. It's not just a playlist of DP songs, though, I have logged the key and tempo of all these songs to provide mashups of each, I do a tiny bit of remixing/editing myself too. I use some of the mashup ideas used from Alive 2007, but I've discovered some magical combinations of my own too.

The tracklisting (with RAM tracks highlighted):

1. End Of Line (Boys Noize Remix) / **Giorgio By Moroder** / The Grid (9:45)

2. **Give Life Back To Music** / **Fragments Of Time** / Rollin' &amp; Scratchin' (6:24)

3. Technologic / Television Rules The Nation / **Motherboard** (7:39)

4. Revolution 909 / Aerodynamic / High Life / **Lose Yourself To Dance** (3:56)

5. Superheroes / **Get Lucky** / Human After All / Musique

6. Burnin' / Harder Better Faster Stronger

7. Around The World / Harder Better Faster Stronger Remixes

8. Phoenix / Emotion

9. One More Time / So Much Love To Give

10. Digital Love / High Fidelity / **Touch**

11. Around The World (Halftime)

12. Fresh / Indo Silver Club / Make Love / Voyager

13. Derezzed / Mothership Reconnection / Teachers

14. **Instant Crush** / **Lose Yourself To Dance** / **Beyond** / **Get Lucky**

15. **The Game Of Love** / Veridis Quo / Something About Us / **Within**

16. Crescendolls / Too Long / Around The World / Aura Rock

17. The Son Of Flynn / Encom (Com Truise Remix)

18. Da Funk / Daftendirekt / Oh Yeah

19. Face To Face / Short Circuit 

20. Together / Music Sounds Better With You / Aerodynamite / Drive

21. Robot Rock / Daft Punk Is Playing At My House / **Doin' It Right**

22. ENCORE: Human After All Remixes / **Beyond** / **Contact** / Steam Machine

You can find a ""full"" tracklisting

Note that some of this is subject to change, I have everything worked out in my head and on paper pretty well.

I have specific lengths for the first three because I've basically finished them (besides some minor mixing changes that I keep tweaking)

**You can listen to a little demo/teaser of the transition between tracks 1 and 2 here:** https://soundcloud.com/needlessnoise/alive-2013-demo

If I work at the current rate, in between projects of my own, work, family, etc.

1365968843.0,1ccbhr,Why Daft Punk Are Going Forward into the Past,impboy,114,10,15,"Something to keep in mind about the stated goals of this LP:

First off, right around the time Madonna signed the Prodigy for $5 million, and the Chemical Brothers made everyone scrounge around for a Big Beat act. Daft Punk at that point were seen as these super-precocious prodigies with an amazing LP and a few hit singles to their credit. There was buzz and hype surrounding them from the very beginning of their come-up, but nothing like you see it now.

I was lucky enough to do an in-person interview with them in '97 before their Alive '97 show in NYC, those guys were pretty much old-schoolers, rifling through past inspiration for guidance. One question I asked them in particular that didn't get published speaks to this: I was a raver at the time in Baltimore, and I asked them who would play at the party fo their dreams. And Thomas said that it wasn't so much about what party they would throw as it was about having a time machine where they could go back and listen to all of the bands they loved that are no longer together. Straight from the jump, they've been interested in everything and anything that was pop-music oriented. I mean, listen to ""Teachers."" Daft Punk has always been about doing their homework. If you'll allow me to extend the metaphor, they've just added on to their courseload as time has progressed and their skills have sharpened.

So a lot of what they said in that RS interview makes real sense to me, it's usually other DJs/producers in the same genre. It's almost always never other musicians. This makes for an extremely insular musical style that as they mention in the article, doesn't budge an inch, since no one can see a means of integrating other musical ideas into the mix. (except for that Re:Generation project, but that was by and large a corporate branding exercise that really doesn't have EDM's best interests at heart, ultimately. But that's another story.)

If change is gonna come, it will have to start reaching across the aisle and seeing all the lessons of musical innovation as part of their toolkit: session musicians, pro studios that have been abandoned for newer gear, etc. The logic here is that if you make your music differently than other producers, then it can't help but possess something those tracks just can't, even if it's a decidedly retro approach familiar to any Black Keys-style revivalist. The fact is it's new to EDM kids who think this music can only be made one way, and can only sound like every other track on the Beatport Top 10. Marshall McLuhan once said we always drive into the future using our rear-view mirrors. I think that makes a lot of sense for Daft Punk.

People like Moby have been crying out for years for the old-school producers to abandon the formulas that DJs rely upon to do their job. I'm hoping that we're on the verge of seeing this finally happen. If Daft Punk can do this

When shopping for musical equipment, speakers, subs, and more based entirely off of what the assholes at Best Buy told him, but he has no idea how any of it works and he has it set up so that the sound quality is of speakers one-tenth the price. 

Your listening experience is what should really determine how much you splurge. Switching from listening to mp3s with Beats/iPod earphones to vinyls and hi-fi speakers/headphones is a massive audio transition that your ears will have a long and hard time transitioning to. **Don't jump straight in to the deep side of the pool, an inexperienced listener won't have the ability to tell the difference between an entry-level turntable and a thousand-dollar feat of engineering. If you don't want to get overwhelmed and you don't want to waste your money, you need to start with entry-level equipment.

**Note that by ""entry-level"" I don't mean cheap or gimmicky**. I mean the first tier of the high-quality pyramid. The first step in a new world. Entry-level equipment can still be relatively expensive

For supporting equipment, and speakers/headphones. A turntable will be a serious upgrade to your audio experience, but what are you going to hook it up to? If you jam to an iHome or Skullcandy headphones that you bought at Walgreens, you would probably get more value physically eating the money you plan on buying a turntable with. You will not be getting vinyl-quality sound, so again, I say look into entry-level speakers or headphones if you don't have some already. A good pair of headphones will be cheaper than a full surround sound speaker set and subwoofer.As for amplifiers you essentially have two choices : solid-state and tube. I will talk more about this later.

I became an aspiring audiophile only a year ago

* [**Audio-Technica ATH-M30 headphones**](http://www.amazon.com/Audio-Technica-ATH-M30-Professional-Closed-back-Headphones/dp/B00007E7C8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368462526&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=ath+m30). They were $40 when I got them and they were the biggest single improvement in sound I ever made. I listened to them primarily through my laptop

* [**Onkyo TX-SR503**](http://www.amazon.com/Onkyo-TX-SR503-receiver-7-1-channel/dp/B0009MX4RA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368463037&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=onkyo+tx-sr503). This was my first amplifier and also doubled as the receiver for my home sound system. I found it cleared the sound slightly and at high volume keeps the sound clear, or built-in amplifier can when you just want to drown out your world in a bravado of highs and lows. Amplifiers are the most technical-heavy with a wide array of statistics which allow you to judge their quality, but the numbers side is my weakest side, so I encourage you to research on your own the stats like Ohms, Watts, etc.

* [**Audio-Technica ATH-M50**](http://www.amazon.com/Audio-Technica-ATH-M50-Professional-Monitor-Headphones/dp/B000ULAP4U/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368462653&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=ath+m50). These are the workhorse of the Audiophile world. The most popular and most trusted headphone model, these are the cans I recommend starting off with. After six months with them I'm still learning to fully appreciate their depth of sound.


* [**Polk Audio RM 6750 5.1 Speaker Set + Subwoofer**](http://www.amazon.com/Polk-Audio-Channel-Theater-Speaker/dp/B0002WTK4S/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368812867&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=polk+audio+rm6750). For the price, these speakers are tuned to carry heavy bass by default, as will most speakers on the market today. To compensate for this, I had to tune the treble on my Onkyo receiver to the highest possible setting. I was concerned the speakers would struggle at this setting, but the sound is beautiful and as close to studio-recording recreation as my ears can detect. As for the bass, it goes without saying the speakers and the subwoofer more than deliver. What many don’t understand and what I need to emphasize, however, bass shouldn’t only manifest itself in the form of air being pumped through your body with no recognizable sound attached. The subwoofer delivers

* [**Audio-Technica AT-LP60 Turntable**](http://www.amazon.com/Technica-AT-LP60USB-Automatic-Driven-Turntable/dp/B002GYTPB8/ref=sr_1_2?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368462884&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=at-lp60). Buying a record player was the best choice I ever made in improving my listening experience. Of course I'm biased, I say upgrade to the [AT-LP120](http://www.amazon.com/Audio-Technica-AT-LP120-USB-Direct-Drive-Professional-Turntable/dp/B002S1CJ2Q/ref=sr_1_11?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368814459) or [Pro-Ject Debut Carbon](http://www.amazon.com/Pro-Ject-Debut-Carbon-Belt-drive-turntable/dp/B00856L1J0/ref=sr_1_2?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368814821&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=pro-ject+debut+iii). Starting with anything more expensive than that is overkill.

* [**Denon AVR-989**](http://www.amazon.com/Denon-AVR-989-805-Watt-Channel-Receiver/dp/B001CSBEKE/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368463786&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=denon+avr-989). Just like the Onkyo, so I wasn't turning down that opportunity. 

In addition to this, [this]( http://www.amazon.com/Polk-Audio-12-Inch-Powered-Subwoofer/dp/B000092TT0/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368813706&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=polk+audio+subwoofer), and two of [these]( http://www.amazon.com/Polk-Audio-TSi400-Floorstanding-Speaker/dp/B0018QROHC/ref=sr_1_5?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368813669&amp;sr=1-5&amp;keywords=polk+audio+ts10). I listen to them every time I come home, but to be honest I don’t think I have enough experience to fully appreciate them yet – and they’re not even correctly set up.  All I can say is those speakers don't discriminate - just like the ATH-M50's every little nuance in a song is picked up. You hear everything.

Now back to amplifiers, tube amplifiers are more expensive. So if you are looking at a tube amplifier and a solid-state amplifier that cost the same, the solid-state amplifier will have a much louder threshold. However, this can also depend on a headphone's impedance.  I find tube amps provide a more distinctive sound, particularly with singer's voices. Solid-state amplifiers run entirely off of circuits and motherboards, and cannot capture voice in the same way.  What I find to be a strong argument for tube amplifiers is that those who use them are 110% sure that they are better than solid state, but those who use solid state amps are always struggling to prove their case. In addition

After this there are all sorts of other improvements you can make to your listening experience such as purchasing custom styluses and cables, and speakers/headphones. My personal recommendation is the ATP-L60 or 120, ATH-M50 and/or Polk Audio RM 6750 set, and a solid tube amp or receiver. This is my recommendation mostly because I haven't tried a wide range of other equipment, except for headphones. I've tried a lot of those. If you are curious about other headphone options, here is a [beginner's guide to buying headphones](http://www.head-fi.org/a/headphone-buying-guide), and here is a [ridiculously in-depth review of 107 different headphone models](http://www.head-fi.org/t/433318/shootout-107-portable-headphones-reviewed-astrotec-as-100hd-as-200hd-added-12-02-12)

You can find out more about audiophile-quality equipment on blogs and forums such as [The Audiophiliac](http://news.cnet.com/audiophiliac/), [Innerfidelity](http://www.innerfidelity.com/). Also, check out /r/vinyl for advice on turntables and how to care for your vinyl records. I want you to remember though that all these sites are frequented by experienced audiophiles, so make sure to emphasize you only need entry-level equipment or they will direct you to some crazy shit.

I think this is enough to get you started and hopefully I've spawned the quest of an aspiring audiophile! High-fidelity sound can change your life. It can heighten your senses and reshape the way you view the world - I know it definitely has for me. If you have any other questions you can of course message me

[Listen Live](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/player/bbc_radio_one) 

[Alternative Live](http://tunein.com/radio/BBC-Radio-1-England-988-s24939/) thanks to /u/theeaglesfan005

I'll try to transcribe the interview or at least some main points when its aired to try and find a link once its finished that will work around the world.

**10.16 GMT** Its over - Zane Lowe will be playing some tracks and chatting to them more later in the week. Extended interview to be posted on R1 youtube page.

**10.13 GMT** They seem to be hinting at a new style of music video. Moving away from traditional visuals towards shorter 1min style pieces. **They are also working on DP mixes of DP. Possibly what was playing in the background.** [~~Possibly heard at 6.51?~~](https://soundcloud.com/notpt/daft-punk-interviewed-by-pete) (Direct Radio Rip thanks to /u/aru3d) Actually a TC bootleg remix

**10.10 GMT:** They had get lucky created before Nile came along - Nile was added after. Its been created over the past 2.5 years and they have been slowly been added and edit over the years.

**10.09 GMT:** As quite a few [people](http://www.reddit.com/r/DaftPunk/comments/1e37h7/daft_punk_pete_tong_interview_thread/c9wdq7t) have noticed

**10.06 GMT:** Pete Tong (PT) has heard the album - gave him goosebumps. Says its sounds like a homage to their childhood in the 70s. Talking about how house came out of the collapse of disco. 

**10.05 GMT:** DP say they fell RAM is their first studio album in some sense... they wanted to see where they could go next and experiment - this takes time.

**10.03 GMT:** ITS STARTING!

**9.57 GMT:** Time for the interview is now **10.05pm** [Tweet Link](https://twitter.com/petetong/status/332962455867232257)

**9.43pm GMT:** Few daft punk related shout outs

**9.06pm GMT:** Interview just been announced to be played just after 10pm GMT



**Some previous Info Pete mentioned whilst on Annie Mac's show:** 

* Daft Punk actually contacted him to organise the interview rather than the other way round.

* He went out and met Daft Punk at Coachella then went back to guy-man's house(?) to do the interview. He also noted that he didn't recognise guy-manuel under his bushy beard. 

* Also mentioned that he was originally only allotted 40 mins (?) for the interview but they ended up talking for over an hour and a half. He also said that a longer interview will be online with possibly more be released next week.

I was wrong.

Some of you who browse the big rumor thread of The Daft Club Forums may already know about this.

A music promo guy who is running a promo campaign in Estonia has posted to the forums about a HUGE promotional thing happening this weekend.

He said it is happening in a certain country

That is all I know.

EDIT!!!!

This video has been linked to me in the comments below: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRenyEX09zQ&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player

I also forgot to mention that my source said that the event would happen in front of the world's eyes. 

Could it really be Monaco or the Indy 500?? :D

EDIT 2!!

Another video showed up on Youtube titled ""#4"" that showed Thomas and Guy on security cam footage walking across an empty room. The video was very quickly made private.

EDIT 3 

MORE VIDEO!!
