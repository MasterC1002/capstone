This year we have released a big new addition to redditgifts that we call the **[redditgifts marketplace](http://redditgifts.com/marketplace/)**.

I noticed some of them wrote that they plan on giving their gift to someone else because they already have too many of a particular items or a ""better quality"" product. 

Example: 'Oh I love these tennis balls that you sent me because I am an avid tennis player but I already have tennis balls that are more high end and have enough of them to last me until the zombies take over. So i'm going to give these to someone else who isn't as into tennis but a novice who doesn't need the higher quality'

I'm not sure why but it bothered me. I mean yah it's good to give something to someone else when you know you aren't going to use it instead of it sitting and gathering dust. But is it really necessary to post it for your SS to read. Maybe they put a lot of thought into your gift or maybe not. I don't know it just bothered me and I wasn't even the SS.

I'm sure everyone on the entirety of Reddit has now seen the letter DoctorYuyi received from their original Secret Santa and I just wanted to post a message to everyone in regards to it.

As you're all aware of the situation that occurred, we do not take this sort of thing lightly.

But in relation to the exchange itself, but more as a sort of reminder to everyone generally:

This exchange is comprised of around 39, beliefs and lifestyles. And it is entirely wrong for anyone involved to judge people based on these things. It doesn't matter what your own beliefs about their lifestyle is, that's not what you're there to judge. What you signed up for was to give a gift to a random stranger related to something they liked, not to judge them for who they are. So who cares maybe if they're an atheist and you're religious, or if they maybe aren't fond of something and you are or whatever; it is in no way anyone's place to say that their match is right or wrong and it is on a whole new level of wrong to actually send a letter like the one received earlier. 

The user who wrote the letter has been banned and removed from the exchange and DoctorYuyi has been rematched. Hopefully their new match is awesome! So I think what we should all do now

Thanks everyone,False,self,t5_2rc6h,True,,elfhat,t3_myviq

In our matching process from now on

In order to qualify as a shafted participant, when you report your gift not received, we ask the sender for proof, so if you lie ... we will research.*

So

We are going to make our best effort to match you to a known good gifter.  What is a known good gifter?  That is someone who in their last completed exchange

We will also let your gifter know that you were shafted previously.

The idea for the site came to me last year when a friend of mine was participating in the Reddit Secret Santa 2011. I remember her saying that it was so difficult figuring out something to buy because it involved really digging deep into a Redditor's profile. One year later I decided to do something about it. [Redective](http://www.redective.com/) is the result! :)

-------------------

**EDIT**

Many changes have been made including the ability to search the frontpage or specific subreddits! Enjoy :)

-------------------

**What does it do?**

It scours Reddit and tabulates the data it can find about your Reddit Secret Santa and displays them to you in a simple form. You can sort every single column and use the filter system (the ""Filter Results"" link at the top once you've performed a search) to only find what you really want.

**What else does it do?**

As well as Redective doing its examining thing

**How does it work?**

Head on over to http://www.redective.com/ and you will see a box to enter a username. Type in the username of your Reddit Secret Santa then click the Search button. That's it. Redective will take care of the rest. The more active a Redditor is

* *Subreddits*: Want to know where your user generally posts? As an example, play games and I'm a PHP web developer. From that I can see exactly what I should get myself this year :)

* *Word Frequencies*: Perhaps it's best to figure out what your Secret Santa likes by looking at the words they most frequently use? All common words that I could think of are automatically excluded (such as 'the','yes',etc) so only those that are relevant should be displayed. What are my most common words? 'never', 'always', 'movie'. erm. Never and Always cancel each other out, so let's go with movies.

* *Hours Active*: Find out what hours (according to your computer's timezone) your user is generally active. This is a novelty feature that probably isn't very useful

* *Overview*: An overview of every comment and submission that Redective could find. It's helpful to see exactly what the user gets karma for so you have more of an idea of their specific interests.

**Does it work?**

It seems to work. I've tested it on a Windows machine using [Opera](http://www.opera.com/), and both work fine.

I don't see why it wouldn't work for anyone, supporting Internet Explorer is one of the most frustrating parts of my job. Help de-stress me by switching :)

**What are those options?**

The options allow you to customize how Redective works. Generally you won't need to change any of these

-------------------

I **really** hope people find it useful and above all

I was skeptical but I went to mattress firm and found a bed I liked and sent him the link. The bed got [here](http://i.imgur.com/poTJB.jpg) yesterday.

Back in March my bed got stolen along with pretty much everything I owned so I have been sleeping on my little brother's bed for a while.
Not only did he finally get his bed back so he won't have to sleep on the uncomfortable couch anymore

I'm still trying to accept the fact that the only gifts I got for Christmas this year were from two random strangers on the internet. I got re matched and my new Secret [santa](http://www.reddit.com/user/p00ndawg/) sent me a beautiful painting almost immediately. 

You are both awesome and really made the last week of 2010 awesome. Thank You :)

So we held the shoot yesterday and it was a total blast. The model, Redditor sounds_like_yon, was a great teacher. At first I was really uncomfortable telling Meliza what to do, but by the end of the two hours everyone was really working well together. 

We took tones of pictures of course

http://samuel006.imgur.com/secret_santa_studio_shoot

This was definitely one of my best Christmas presents ever. Thanks Reddit!

Edit: [Here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/28289918@N06/sets/72157625862176113/) is a Flickr gallery in case anyone can't follow the original link.

What I learned:

1. A gray background (even a white one) can come out white or black depending on the set-up.

2. In studio photography

3. There are a hell of a lot of ways to light a subject. I won't go into all of them here

4. It's important to have some clear ideas of what you want to accomplish well before you start. 

5. Sometimes the best looking poses involve exaggerated postures and are the most unnatural/uncomfortable for the model. 

Interesting side notes:

1. The gas mask and the knife were supplied by the SS's friend who also came to help out.

2. The bubble gun quit at the start of the shoot. The one we got was a random shot during set up when Meliza was just playing around.

3. We only got 3 candy shots and none of them was perfect. There was one where Meliza came out great but the candy wasn't in frame,False,self,t5_2rc6h,True,,,t3_fg9k8

First I began receiving some mysteriously amusing Christmas cards - attached were paperclips, cause they're hilarious - a dog humping santa's leg is my favourite. 

This house decor would've sufficed, but he worried that I would have to pay the tax on international shipping. So what did he do? He drove to Montreal from New Jersey to ship it using the Canadian postal service. I thought that was ridiculously kind of him, but turns out his kindness gets EVEN MORE RIDICULOUS. 

I missed the package yesterday, and didn't think I could carry it home. Well, she was right, so I came back to pick it up by car.  

I opened it up having NO idea what could be inside. Turns out the box was filled with individually wrapped smaller items. It was like opening a treasure chest of awesome. One by one I took out:

* 5 posters
* 3 bags of starbucks coffee (MUCH NEEDED.)
* 8 CDs (including a No Doubt greatest hits CD
* A No Doubt videos DVD (how did he knowww)
* A 25 piece set of kitchen utensils (yesss)
* 4 sets of Ralph Lauren perfume/body lotion
* A where's waldo t-shirt!!
* The Onion's ""Our Front Pages""
* Stickers!
* Star Wars USB key
* An antistatic Wrist Strap (thanks for reading my previous comments =)) 
* and a Christmas Story Nightlight

The picture doesn't do these gifts justice - this is incredible. There's no way I can keep all of this - my friends are getting some stuff so this is like a donation to your Poor n' Stressed Canadian Students Society.

For those of you who have this fear

* Remember that we are girls *on reddit!* That means there is a decent chance that we are into some of the same stuff as you. I've only met a few girls on reddit who are super duper girly types and aren't into things like LEGO and gaming and science and nerd-tivities

* Shopping for a girl is not all that different than shopping for a guy. Get us something cool and interesting that will make us yell ""SCORE"" when we open it. The chances of you being paired with a girl who spends all her time on reddit talking about pantyhose and nail polish and PMS and chocolate is probably not too likely. Even a girl who *does* talk about those things over in 2X probably spends time in /r/books or /r/gaming, say Bath and Body Works. **DON'T PANIC.**

* Stalk us just like you would stalk any other redditor. Don't read every comment and attach ""said she"" at the end of it. Better yet, and remove any pronouns from your thinking. Instead of thinking, ""Hey, *she* really loved Harry Potter..... I guess I could buy her Harry Potter underwear or something..."" think, ""Hey, my match really loved all the Harry Potter books - I'll buy them this sweet handmade book cover from Etsy to keep their favourite one safe!"" (OK granted a book cover is probably a wee bit more feminine thing to buy than masculine, but you get my drift). **DON'T PANIC.**

In conclusion: we like cool shit. We like toys. We like games. We like things that are fun and different that will make us squeal with delight when we get to call it our own. And

*edit:* I had no idea this post would get any amount of response comparable in volume to what I am seeing going on! That was way wordier than it needed to be, which is an epic win! It always makes me happy when I say something that tends to speak on behalf of all ____________________, so it's nice when it's actually seen as pretty accurate. 

**P.S.** While I wouldn't say that this is a *problem*, an active concern in the mind of the occasional male redditor. At least a third of the comments on here consist of ""Really!? That's a problem!?"" and my answer is always, ""Yes, really, that's why I posted this!"" ",,False,t5_2rc6h,True

A few quick points I want to get out of the way:

1. If you’ve emailed support and we haven’t gotten back to you yet
2. The site **will be** under heavy load on Monday. We will do everything in our power to keep the site up, and not you. Give it a couple hours and try again.
3. Matching should be done mid-morning Mountain time. We’ll start sending out emails when it’s done.

**The Redditgifts Marketplace:**

With this year’s Secret Santa, you’ll see a drop down in the top right hand corner with your exchange matches. Then, when you pick the desired giftee, we’ll pre-fill in the shipping info, and finally, when the business marks your items as shipped, we’ll even mark your exchange gift as shipped


Common questions that will come up over the next few days:

- **When do I need to ship by?** December 14th. If you can’t ship by then, that’s ok.
- **Can I change the likes and dislikes I put in when I signed up?** Yep
- **Can I ask my giftee questions?** Absolutely! To the right of their address on the ‘retrieve match’ page
- **How much do I need to spend?** We [recommend](http://redditgifts.com/faq/#how-much-am-i-expected-to-spend) spending 20$ USD
- **Is the person I'm sending to the person who's sending me a gift in return?** No
- **What was the name of that site I could use to look up someone’s reddit activity?** Because redditors are awesome
- **Something’s come up and I can’t participate any more

[Church Volunteer Accused Of Abusing Boys - NewsChannel 5.com ...](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CAkQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.newschannel5.com%2FGlobal%2Fstory.asp%3FS%3D10141550&amp;ei=mfAaS8OFGsGXtgfY9YX3CQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNEoZ6eY1V8OdCXs8JtP1pzRUpCjyQ&amp;sig2=spy_TY2G-Rm3wNBV_SsMiQ) and [Church volunteer accused of raping boys - WKRN

instantly, she added ""you'll never get a job!"" which didn't concern me nearly as much as my secretsanta thinking i raped little kids. i rushed to reddit to try and clear this up. 

please upvote this so hopefully my secretsanta will read it and not send me a bomb in the mail.

she's still laughing. maybe i'll start going by william (my first name).

Well

Now, photodocumented it and did the layout. The recipes themselves are recipes that you find all over Sweden with different variations. 

Swedish Plain Fare is every day cuisine and is normally known as **Husmanskost**

So please, toss it, share it, cook from it... it's yours. It's not huge, and I'm sure it has plenty of flaws but I've made it with love.

TLDR: My giftie's mom turned over his/her gift to the police.





&gt;Okay
I found it on the way out of the house. I was going to an appointment today so I got in the car with my mom (can't drive yet) and opened it up. First thing I took out was the Walking Dead. Whoa, but my mother starts freaking out. ""WHAT IS THAT DID THEY SEND YOU A GUN OH NO OH MY GOD"" I tell her to relax, and pull out the next thing, a heavy unidentified...metal thing? Keep in mind that I had no idea where this came from. So seeing a big heavy unidentified metal thing in thick bubble wrap made me a bit nervous. My insanely paranoid mother, of course, starts flipping her shit. I don't know what to tell her (still too occupied with the surprise of getting a huge box to ponder over where it came from) so I say ""Alright, relax! We can tell the police
I don't know what the hell it is
We were going right by the fire station anyway, I don't know anyone in Georgia, it's pretty heavy, could you take a look just to be safe. I'm sure it's nothing."" They empty the box and set aside the two bubble-wrapped things. We walk away a few meters from the car; the firemen are asking me ""Are you SURE you didn't order anything online?"" I think for a second. FUCK, FUCK, FUCK it's my reddit gift. FUCK.
So I spend ten minutes trying to convince the firemen that really, and I myself had sent a package to a stranger a couple months ago, and it's not a bomb, and we can just open it and be on our merry way. But no, we wait for them to send a local cop, who opens it and confirms that it's just a nerf gun and a bottle. My mother, who has been panicking and crying over no doubt dozens of imagined disaster scenarios
They throw out both the gun and the bottle, honestly, it's just a gift and that you are being nice, really. One of the firemen starts telling me never to do this again, never to trust anyone on the internet, it's too much of a risk.
They leave everything in the garbage
So we leave and I am finally able to convince my mother that the package was perfectly fine

In order to do this we have added a new page for you to [manage your exchanges](http://redditgifts.com/exchanges/manage/).  To get to this page you just click your exchanges link at the top of the page on redditgifts.  From this page you can see all the exchanges you're participating in and any upcoming exchanges (none yet).  You can also see how many **exchange credits** you have.  

WTF is an exchange credit you might ask?  It's pretty simple

To complete an exchange you must have satisfied all of these requirements:

1. retrieved your match
2. shipped your gift
3. had the gift you shipped received and posted to redditgifts **or** proven shipping via a receipt or something nice like that to an admin.
4. posted the gift you received **or** confirm that you didn't receive a gift.

This year, you can see other redditors on the map around the world!

Here are the issues we know about and are dealing with right now:

1. We only have one server that we run redditgifts on.  We had a ton of traffic yesterday and the majority of it was not passive read traffic, there are only so many processes one machine can handle.  We just have to deal with this, we dont make any money on redditgifts and getting more servers really just isnt an option.  Sorry.

2. Emails - We send a lot of emails ... like a ton! Since yesterday we have sent more than 21, comcast won't even receive our emails.  Do you work for comcast? please fix that!

3. Verification - Since yesterday we have had over 7400 people sign up on redditgifts as new users.  For each one of these

This year we decided to open up signups earlier than ever and we also decided to promote more than before.  I think these were good decisions to make for a number of reasons

**For the old-timers**

Remember last year when this whole thing happened? It all happened in a few weeks, people were astounded at how many redditors lived right next to them, people asking many, many questions about how shit is going to work, and the answers were few and far between because we didn't know yet, but we figured it all out together.

Well, they make repetitive posts ... basically they just found out that santa claus exists and it is blowing their mind, just like it probably blew your mind when you were 4 years old or whatever.

The idea for the reddit secret santa program came up on november 10th and a lot of redditors have shown interest.  I have read just about every comment and put as much thought into all of them as humanly possible and come to some decisions for how this is going to run.  Here is what is going to happen, please direct them to this post.

* **Step 1.** If all goes according to plan, continue to step 2.

* **Step 2** On December 1st you will receive an email indicating who you need to send a super-fucking-awesome package to.  The email will contain: reddit username

* **Step 3** You will have 10 days to ship your item.  PLEASE ship by the 10th and before if at all possible.  The hope is that everybody will get their packages by December 24th.

First of all, when it snows in Scotland it *snows*. I haven't ventured outside since it started, it's sort of went a bit [like this](http://imgur.com/AxreO) any time I've considered venturing outside.

But anyway! Moving on!

There are just a few points I wanted to address as shipping day approaches.

1. If your Santa has not retrieved you in x amount of days

2. If your Santa hasn't messaged you

3. See the gift you got your giftee? *It's awesome*. So stop worrying that because people have got crusies and kindles and all sorts that your gift won't match up. Your giftee will love your gift because you put effort into thinking of something they would like; that's the whole point of it! So stop thinking they'll be disappointed or something because you know they really won't be. (Unless they're a douche

4. If you've sent a message to your giftee and it wasn't through the anonymous option on the retrieval page then I'm sorry

5. Those of you who are desperate for a message from your Santa

6. DON'T under any circumstances, so please be considerate to any and every circumstance.

7. If you receive a gift, if you get a gift then at the very least you should be sending a quick message to say you did get it if you don't have the time for a big detailed post at that time.

8. If you can, just remember to ask for a receipt. This makes it easier for the team to keep your account alive and kicking if your package gets all late and muddled somewhere or if your giftee says they never got it. 

Wow

Other than that

No worries

FIRST of all

There were [two water bottles and a notebook on top of the pens](http://i.imgur.com/17aDM.jpg) and as I pulled out the pens I discovered many useful items; [sets of highlighters](http://i.imgur.com/bferb.jpg), gum, a flash drive, chapstick, a tiny hp mouse (my mouse died out on me a few months ago and haven't gotten around to replacing it, now I don't have to, works great!), [a witch ring](http://i.imgur.com/AazS0.jpg)  (wearing it right now! haha) mints and a small black box. Now, take pictures

As I took the little box out, looked at it.. wondered what is it? a phone? flipped it to the back, ""Mobile HD Snap Camera"". Oh. Em. Gee. I put it back down, not wanting to get my hopes up (long story short, my siblings and I.. we always try to trick eachother by putting gifts in boxes of other things.. like shoes in a toaster box or candy in a jewelry box, etc) and proceeded to take out the rest of the pens and sort them out as I glanced furtively over at the box thinking NO. WAY... 

I finally finished unpacking the box, built in 4gb memory, and very easy to use. I didn't know such a thing existed, a camcorder this small? (I'm a bit behind on the advanced gizmos, this is my very first 'touch' piece of equipment, woohoo :) 


So to continue my too long story, others have highlighters on the ends or come with built in sticky post-it dispenser, cool logos, etc. All I know is I am set for life on pens! And as for the [Bloggie](http://i.imgur.com/MuJo5.jpg), well, I don't think I mentioned in any of my comments that I lost my point and shoot in January :( and I am putting my DSLR up for sale due to an unexpectedly long term of unemployment and very untimely medical bills. So this is... just perfect and so incredibly generous, [I can't thank you enough!](http://i.imgur.com/1J6e5.jpg)

The standard response seems to be that any gift with a little thought is appreciated. That's exactly how I hoped most people would see it

Thanks for the replies.

It's comforting to know that the majority of people have signed up with the right intention - to give a gift rather than receive one.

1324155423.0,ngnds,My SS deserves an award for most heartfelt Secret Santa,jesspest,192,23,26,"Just a little background about myself: 
I am a 22-year-old mother of an 18 month old, and anything else is based on commission. I was working full-time until I got laid off in October. I tried to find another job, but despite it being illegal to discriminate against pregnant woman when hiring people, no one is willing to hire me because I will have to take time off when the baby comes. Therefore, everything has been an enormous struggle for us since then, and getting ready for the baby to come has been basically impossible.  

I was only introduced to reddit about 6 months ago, and I have enjoyed becoming part of this amazing community. This was my first year participating in the redditgifts Secret Santa Exchange, and I my experience has been nothing short of amazing. 

My Secret Santa sent me the first part of my gift a few weeks ago. I was surprised to receive two items from my baby registry, and that the 2nd part would be arriving on December 14.  

Well on December 14th


Season’s Greetings jesspest

This is the third redditgifts Gift Exchange in a row in which I have participated.
Ordinarily, I am known for being attentive to people when it comes to gift giving. And I, for the very most part, end up giving people what they really like.
However, in some strange way, knew about how generous I am during the holidays because as I read your reddit history, I realized that you are in a position in which you really need things. And in thinking about what to get you, I also realized that there are people in your family who could need and use a lot of things as well. Therefore, I quickly snapped into action.
Now
And as for you, and one who would pay little attention to what she herself needs and wants. This was what really put me in a bind because normally, as I said, I am pretty good at figuring out what my giftees would like. But in your case, I thought to myself, “If this woman leaves me absolutely no clue as to what I should give her as a gift, she must be an amazing mother.” So, which I have absolutely no doubt is true
As you and I both know, is based on karma. And when I read your reddit history, I also realized that you and your new family could use all the good karma you can get, especially at this time of year. I charge you to take all of this good karma that you received when you opened this package (and the “package” before this one), and do good for others around you. The smallest of things that anyone does for his or her fellow man is what makes this world go ‘round.
And with this


I was very touched by the letter, our baby girl who isn’t even born yet. Guess he really is an amazing stalker to have known her name, lol. He also sent a few items for everyone in the family. And then there was only one gift left in the box, which was labeled for myself. It said, “For when your kids are napping or you get a few spare quiet moments to yourself.” I opened it to find a KINDLE! And an Amazon gift card! 

I just want to say thank you to my Secret Santa

I'd actually forgotten this memory for a while because it happened when I was 15 (31 now

I grew up being a huge Superman fan and ever since I can remember I always wanted to be the next Lois Lane. While I loved Superman

As a kid I would document my mom's moves in the kitchen minute by minute or report on which bird feeder was favored by our winged guests that day. I always had a pad of paper in hand and a pen tucked behind my ambitious ear. I was addicted to writing - news especially. It made sense to me. 

When my parents finally told me the Easter Bunny and Tooth Fairy were a lie, I'd had heard about it long before my parents made this report to a me. I just figured it was old news and certainly not worth reporting. Not on my memo pad at least. 

(Sorry

Fast forward to high school. I grew up and never lost my Lois Lane ambition. I bounded into high school ready to write up a storm because this was the first time I would have an opportunity to write for a *real* paper. The High School had its own paper and I couldn't wait to run into the newsroom and write. 

Turns out only Sophomores were eligible to be in the Newspaper class, but I digress...

I said YES YES YES in so many ways. I remember jumping up and down because I was so damn happy. I told my mom when I got home from school that day that I had made it! 

I waltzed into that room during 8th period the next day thinking I'd be asked to write a BIG story. I had my pens and paper ready to go. 

Not one single person looked at me. Oh they looked

Days and weeks went by. I was able to sit in on editor meetings and watch the writers turn facts into stories

I was ok with that

I thought this is my chance. This is how I will show everyone that I can give a good gift and maybe then, so i spent a week's worth of my paycheck and bought my giftee lotions and body scrubs and lip balm - the whole nine yards. I was so excited to have her open it. 

And she LOVED it. She really did and I was so happy.

Then came the other gifts.

One after another and not one of them had my name. Again and again people opened their gifts and a knot welled up in my stomach. 

OH MY GOD... they are not going to call my name. There wasn't going to be a gift for me...

My Secret Santa had skipped class that day... 

I wanted to run and hide. ""You can't hide under the desk

 I had no idea what to do. 

When the Newspaper Adviser realized what had happened

I held out my hands and took it while holding back 9th grade tears. My teacher was the only person who gave me a gift. Why on earth did nobody in this class understand how hard I've been trying to become a part of them and now

Why does it hurt so much just to be me?

I guess there's a reason I blocked this out - it was the saddest gift I've ever received in my entire life.

So I end this story here. If you're a giftee please give your person something. If you don't have any money send them a card - it might mean the world to them. 

*EDIT:* I should note that I became the Editor and Chief of that school newspaper and made sure that no one ever was meant to feel the way I did. Freshmen and Sophomores were welcome to submit stories and feel a part of the experience.

It was a great paper up until I left and I left it in great hands. That Advisor became Principal of the school - no joke. He's a great guy. 

I'll provide proof if needed. Oh and I became an Art Director... if you care :)

I hope you're all getting prepared for shipping day! Currently, it [ripped our goddamn fence down](http://i.imgur.com/Gp3rb.jpg) but I've been sitting at the computer in my pyjamas eating apples all day so I'm fiiiiine.

Moving on!

A quick few points as shipping day approaches:

1. If you cannot ship by the 12th

2. When you receive a gift

3. Make sure you've checked all the customs regulations if you're shipping abroad; you don't want to get you or your giftee in trouble by sending something contraband. 

4. If you're sending food and haven't asked your giftee their allergies

5. Consider your giftee's living situation. If they have children or live with their parents and your gift is maybe a little NSFW

Okay, you know where to find us.

Happy Holidays!

First of all

1. *Matching will be done randomly **later on today** so please don't make posts asking why matching hasn't happened yet!*

2. *You will be able to retrieve your match at around **9am Pacific Standard Time.** If you want to check what time it is there in relation to where you are


Okay

Secondly, problems are pretty much guaranteed!) So if you have any of these, please get in contact with us; ***problems with the site, questions about your account or how to work RedditGifts and general moans do not add to subreddit discussion so please do not post these on the subreddit.*** Also keep in mind that we all have real lives as much as you do and sometimes can't dedicate all our time to this. We are very dedicated though! I mean I'm currently hurrying to finish a 2500 word essay so I can give you all focussed attention later!

Also

At this current time of writing

**Important point!**
READ ALL THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO YOU!!

We've had posts in the spam filter and also questions asked to us where the answers are very easily available and obvious as to where they are located. Like where to sign up; it's linked in the sidebar!! You should be reading the sidebar and going to the links relevant to you.

*Information about dates:* In the Secret Santa 2011 menu on RedditGifts

I want as many people as possible with questions or in need of tips to read the [RedditGifts Big Ass Guide Book](http://www.scribd.com/doc/69018698/The-Big-Ass-Guide-Book); it's there for a reason and can answer some general questions you may have.

Part of doing secret santa is the happiness that the gift giver receives by seeing their gift in the gallery ... I failed on this front.

Here are my instructions:

**1) Have a picture of the gift you received.**

I got what I deserved:  http://i.imgur.com/Of0oD.jpg

**2) Have the text of this message**
*""There is a package on the way to you.

You are to look at the gift and read the message on the packing slip. 

You are going think about what the message says. If you are unclear what it means

You can either report it as a received gift and slink off into the night.. or you can do things my way for greater reward. 

In that case

The post will: 
1) Have a picture of the gift you received. 
2) Have the text of this message and
3) post the text (in full!) of message on the packing slip. 
4) Have an explanation from yourself and a bit about why you do certain things in certain ways. 

You'll know what I mean when you read the message. 

All 4 elements of the post must be met. You will have exactly 48 hours from the time stamp of when the package is delivered to do this. If you do not post, you get after this. Like I said, it's completely up to you. 
""*

**3) post the text (in full!) of message on the packing slip.** 
The packing slip said: ""A gift note from T.B.
Andy, or even a picture.  BAH, HUMBUG!""

**4) Have an explanation from yourself and a bit about why you do certain things in certain ways.**
Now is my turn for a TOSH.0 web redemption.  I agree.  I have not fulfilled the reciprocal nature of SS.  I would first like to explain that I have been very active in my part of the SS of gift giving.  I have signed up for the international shipping option, she got stiffed and got no gift.  So I bought her a gift and mailed it to our house so that she would not loose faith in Reddit.  (She still does not know)  So I have been an active and faithful participant for 3 years of gift giving.  But I have failed in gift receiving.  

Until pointed out by this years Reddit SS

Now a video representation of how I made the other SS people feel:

I do want to warn everyone about this scam

This happened to me in my second exchange. Several days after the deadline for shipping I got a message from my Santa telling me that he had sent my gift but that he had lost his tracking information. He asked me if I would mark my gift as received b/c he was worried he might get banned or whatever if I didn't do so right away. I trusted him so I marked the gift as received. Guess what? I never received a gift.

Flash forward to today. My Santa for this exchange sent me a long sob-story about how his car broke down so he had to spend a bunch of money to get it fixed. He has my gift

Happiness is all that matters, so never waste your time on things and people you hate, live your life for the happiness of yourself and those you love. Smile, every day."" There is a girl living on my street who would stand at my bus stop every morning with me who I'm fairly certain goes to the same school as me, she didn't wear gloves and pulled her sleeves up over her hands. I gave her the present. 

That was all. She smiled

Hey guys

So I'm a reporter at CBC and get to funnel great stories from here into a different medium

I told them about the Secret Santa and they want to make a story about it for tomorrow.

Here's the catch:

They need to speak with a Montrealer for the story. Everything has to be viewed from a local perspective first. And the interview would take place tomorrow on CBC Radio One (cbc.ca/montreal; listen live!)

Send me a message if you are a Montrealer who took part.

EDIT: Thanks everybody! So far I'm in contact with 4 different people and this is going to be a great story to air on Christmas Eve. I'm so glad we're able to share such an amazing story with our listeners.

You guys rock!

EDIT 2:

It looks like my producers has booked two people already.

It will air during the morning show tomorrow between 6-830am. I'll try and get a more precise time later today.

Thanks for you help guys. It would of been nice to have as many people as possible on

You can listen live [here](http://www.cbc.ca/listen/streams/r1_montreal.html)

Merry Christmas!

----------  

**PREAMBLE**: As per [the rules](http://redditgifts.com/exchanges/secret-santa-2011/rules/):  
&gt; 9- Rematching will occur based on the generosity of redditors. If people do not sign up to give

----------  
----------  

Now that shipping day has come and gone

- **My Santa never pulled my information or they never shipped
Nowhere. You don't need to do a thing

- **My Santa claimed they sent something
Patience young grasshopper. Twenty-Five (25) days after your Santa marked the gift shipped

- **Do I need to sign up to be a rematch Santa to be put in the rematch giftee pool?**  
No

- **How will I know if I've been rematched?**  
You'll see *two* giftboxes instead of one on the exchange status page.  

- **When will rematching happen?**  
Round 1 will be *about* a week after the shipping deadline.  
Round 2 will be *about* a week after round 1 and is done in waves.  
Round 3 will be *about* two weeks after round 2 completes (roughly late January).  

- **Rounds? What are the rounds?**  
Round 1 = People you were never retrieved.  
Round 2 = People whose information was retrieved
Round 3 = People who had a gift shipped

- **I want to be a rematch Santa
Head over to http://redditgifts.com/exchanges/secret-santa-2011/rematch/ and sign up.  

- **I signed up to be a rematch Santa
You are signed up to give again only. You will not receive anything except thanks. 

- **How will I know if I'm a rematch Santa?**  
Much like on matching day

- **When do I need to ship by?**  
There is no hard rule on when you should ship by

- **I signed up for more than one rematch
Potentially not. You may get some new giftees in the first round

- **Can I still sign up to be a rematch Santa or change the number I'm willing to give after round 1 is done?**   
Absolutely!  

- **I see there are more people potentially needing rematching then there are people who signed up to be rematch Santas. What happens then?**  
We will try to rematch as many people as possible
*NOTE*: The number of ""rematch signups"" of the stats page is the total number of gifts people have signed up to give.

- **I'm still confused... Help?**

The change to matching so far is showing great results (more on this in a few weeks when we have more data) and today I've released our next change - **rating the gifts you've received**!

First I'll say that these ratings are not for public consumption.  The person who sent you a gift will never know what you've rated the gift they sent.  This is something that will help us identify bad participants and take possible action to disallow future participation.

From now on, it would be *extremely* helpful to us if you would go through the old gifts you've received and rate them.  To make this easier, we've added a new message on old exchanges you've done that need ratings.  Please go to your [exchange management page](http://redditgifts.com/exchanges/manage/) and follow the links to rate your gifts!

1292089921.0,ek54t,A generous gift for a tiny rat!,jangleberry112,145,13,30,"r/Secret Santa

Since graduating with my music education degree in May of 2009, never had enough money to pay all the bills and live comfortably. Like many others my age I am scraping by with what I have.

About 4 months ago I noticed my rats Pipsqueak and Mama Delilah developing mammary tumors, and when I noticed that the tumors were continuing to grow I called a bunch of vets in the city to get an estimate on what the surgery would cost to have done.

The cheapest vet I found quoted me a price of $150 per rat plus an $80 consultation fee, but actually places me on a career path that may lead somewhere really good, and makes me considerably happier. So the finances got tighter, but still I saved.

I participated in the 2010 Arbitrary day and loved it. For Secret Santa I sent my giftee this year a gift of homemade beer, EVER, expected such a generous gift on my own doorstep.

My Secret Santa sent me a plethora of gifts for my rats and my kitty cat Alice

This $300 is by far the most generous thing I have ever received and it more than covers the cost of Pipsqueak's consultation and surgery. I am planning on donating the remainder of the money to a local shelter called Austin Pets Alive! Which is a non-profit volunteer-run shelter which strives to make the city of Austin a no-kill city.

My Secret Santa has so far stayed anonymous, but I'd like to say this:

The last year of my life has been, and it was made worse by feeling so helpless in terms of making my rats better. I had all but lost all of my faith in humanity, but you renewed it. Every time I get frustrated by Reddit, by the political squabbling and petty disagreements, by the trolls and the misogynists, I have to stop and remind myself that there really are truly wonderful and generous people on this site, who are willing to do something as generous as to donate $300 in cash to a complete stranger so her pet rat can get surgery. My heart is truly filled with an overabundance of love and gratefulness right now, for giving me faith in people again

Thank you. Thank you

I work with Dog Rescue groups so I know all about emergency vet bills.

I will match every dollar you guys donate up to $1000 between now and New Years Day.

Here is the website with details: http://anamazingtail.synthasite.com/

And a link to the page where you can donate (Paypal link on the bottom) http://anamazingtail.synthasite.com/you-can-help.php

Edit: Currently at $5449. I am working off that number as $0. Anything above that I will match up to $1000

I log in to redditgifts.com and check out the message.   Here it is in it's entirety:


&gt;From: your secret santa 2011 match to you

&gt;So as someone who is also going through the joys of divorce and single fatherhood I know what you are probably going through. I ended up with a restraining order and full custody of my son. Single fatherhood can be rough at times


After reading this message I teared up big time - here at work - sitting at my desk.  Just amazed at the kindness my SS displayed and wow'ed by the crates of sliced onions somewhere in the corner over there behind my desk.  

This isn't a post trying to score karma points or kudos for being a single dad or any such nonsense.  This is a post meant to thank my anonymous Secret Santa here on Reddit.   While I've already thanked him on redditgifts

Thank you again Secret Santa.  Thank you Reddit.  And thank you to an awesome community of kind

[Edit 3]

Since I've received this gift my Secret Santa has informed me that the above was the 1st of a 2 part gift. The first part being for my son

Now my Secret Santa is sending me clues from the Reddit username holliscallnumber. In each post he adds in a numerical clue (Hollis call numbers) that I would be privy to know due to my job. I've deciphered them with some help and then just a few days ago my Secret Santa sent me an alphabetical clue that I had to decipher using a cypher wheel. 

With that all in hand

I'll keep this post updated as I learn more about the 2nd part of my Secret Santa gift!

1291803571.0,ei7ns,I don't feel like being a Secret Santa anymore,evilsanta2010,177,48,176,"I signed up for Secret Santa because it seemed like a really great idea, there are a few things that really make me feel just forgetting about the whole thing:

1. My giftee is annoying as fuck. And I don't say this lightly; please don't get the idea that I'm just looking for an excuse to bail out because I'm too cheap to buy a gift. I was really into this whole thing. Anyway, not a troll, and most certainly sending him a gift.

2. He was a complete douche about it, apologized, made an effort to be-friend him.

3. Checked his comment history: he is annoying at best, I know how judgemental I sound right now, I don't really know how to put my exact dislike in words. It's just that now the whole Secret Santa thing has lost it's joy for me because it isn't heartfelt.

4. Also: All his messages to me begin with 'Oh hai' or some variation, perhaps), he asked me for money. Or an iPhone (lolwut). Goddamn I don't know if I'm just having a crap day which is why I'm so irate, but just re-hashing this is irritating the fuck out of me.

Before I get abused by people who think I'm the one being douchey, get along with, and perhaps be a friend in real life.
