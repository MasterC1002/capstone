&gt;PALS!

&gt;I have a mass inside my right testicle and according to the Doctor there is a 90% chance that this mass is cancer.

&gt;CANCER!!!

&gt;It's a lot more frightening than it sounds and as someone currently strapped into this weird ride through cancer land I can tell you that though the experience is not one I would necessarily buy tickets for I've certainly experienced far more dreadful things. For e
xample the time I got crabs from a Mcdonald's cashier or the time my dog died when I was 12.

&gt;OK that's bullshit. It actually is one of the most intense and bizarre things I have ever experienced and my mind is still in the process of making sense of the fact that next Wednesday one of my testicles will be sliced into pieces

&gt;The truth is that I've never paid much attention to my balls. outside of occasionally horrifying myself by holding a hand mirror near them they've been something that I've intentionally ignored for most of my life. Last month when I noticed that one of them was bigger than the other I ignored it because I figured it would get through whatever it was going through and return to it's regular size.

&gt;It didn't.

&gt;So two days ago I went to a physician to get a physical and upon feeling my swollen testicle he immediately sent me to a urologist who gave me an ultrasound and immediately scheduled a ball snipping for this upcoming Tuesday morning. The procedure takes one hour and they put you into some kind of sedated state called ""twilight"" I'm quite looking forward to this and I'm going to see if they'll let me take a recorder in to document the experience. I'm pretty sure they won't.

&gt;The good news is that this particular form of cancer

&gt;There are three certainties in life: old age

&gt;So please don't stress out about this. I will gladly receive your prayers

&gt;Outside of losing a testicle the real tragedy here is that I've had to cancel my nashville shows and my End Of The World show in Atlanta. For those of you who were planning to come out I am truly sorry and as soon as I get an idea of the specifics of my meat bodies untimely malfunction I will reschedule.

Well

He now runs his own website

&gt;After writing and podcasting for about eight months

&gt;I worked for the company for over a year and had a lot of fun. But over time

&gt;After a while, and in some cases — downright dishonest.

&gt;When I started, or critical thinking. Sure, I knew about how to form a hypothesis, what independent and dependent variables were, and everything else you need to make a science fair. Hell, my dad’s been a science teacher for almost three decades. Frankly, that’s about as much as most people know about critical thinking

&gt;I was writing articles about how “calories didn’t count, and nutrient deficiencies, and how exercise really makes people weak and fat. The answer was, of course, mostly to take the supplements and follow the extremely rigid and unscientific guidelines on the site. I disagreed with a lot of this stuff from the beginning, but I figured the work was still doing more good than harm. Eventually, I realized I was wrong.

&gt;“Research” in this job meant digging up Pubmed abstracts that seemed semi-relevant to the topic and citing them to make the information look halfway credible. At first that seemed scientific enough to me. I was still only sixteen

&gt;At first this lazy approach to research was easy. But then something happened — I became good at research. I’m an obsessive person

&gt;In this case

&gt;I wanted to actually help people — and myself — not just say stuff because it was cool or because it helped sell supplements. Despite the fact that my job only paid me to find the abstracts of studies

&gt;This caused major problems for my job. I started asking questions, I wasn’t going to last long after that point.

&gt;I became even more concerned and frustrated when more and more emails came in from people who were desperate for help

&gt;Like every other pseudoscientific alternative health website

&gt;I’ve always been obsessive about doing the right thing. I haven’t aways done a great job

&gt;I resigned. I gave up what probably would have been a comfortable living for my credibility. I resigned so I could sleep at night without feeling like I was lying to myself and others.

&gt;I actually sold the rights to an entire book I had written (I believe around 100

&gt;When it was time for the book to be published, hyped, modified, and misrepresented.

1368701561.0,1efzoh,"Ok seriously, before you hit me with the obligatory ""well you don't have to listen to it"", can we just discuss honestly: Does anyone else feel like the JRE has been declining in quality for some time now?",,269,422, ""don't be a cunt"". And yes I know that I don't have to listen to it.

But the reason I ask is I see that many here are echoing things that I have thought to myself. You could dismiss all of that as ""they're just being cunts""

However it seems to me that it has become more and more of a circlejerk. The same old stories and guests, and having fascinating guests on. Over time it seems that it has become about ""mentoring"" the audience on how to be ""better people"" and it just comes across to me as condescending. 

I also think that Rogan has become hypocritical in many ways. His support for pedophile gang rapist Lloyd Irvin

For example his recent appearance on the DVDASA podcast. He seemed to act like a complete jerk to them and often tried to alpha David Choi and get one over on him. The next podcast David and Asa talked about how they weren't going to have as many guests on

Now here a lot of people will say ""why are you watching it if you don't like it"". It's because, from cover, with a precision rifle and specialist hunting gear. 

Also the selling of onnit equipment. Onnit do have some decent products, is on the show, the ads mysteriously disappear. 

You'd have to believe A LOT to claim that that and the other occurances of it are just a complete coincidence.

Personally I think they should move to one show per week

Even though Steven Greer was a bullshit artist, Kevin Smith, Chael Sonnen, etc.

Compare that to when he has Bryan Callen on and they mentor the audience with life advice for a solid 3 hours. It just doesn't hold up. 

As I said

1351155762.0,122340,My Joe Rogan Story.....,xxx711,158,18,63,"So I knew Rogan was from News Radio and always wondered how he went from that to being a UFC announcer.

I originally started listening to the podcast because I thought it wo0uld be almost entirely focused on the UFC

So the first Podcast I listened to was 164 with Shane Smith

The podcast has had such a dramatic impact on my life in such a short amount of time.  I have changed in the following ways:

1. It has helped the redefine masculinity for me.  Often masculinity is defined in a st range way in Western Culture.  It illuminated the fact that you can be caring and kind and still be considered macho.

2.  It has made me an incredibly positive person. ""Treat people as if they are you living another life.""  A simple lesson I apply from the JRE is to smile at strangers.  If you don't do it

3. It has made more socially aware.  I was into politics and world affairs before JRE

4.  Health/Fitness-  The JRE has really opened my eyes to nutrition and the importance of nutrition and exercise for living a balanced life.  This is another thing about Western Culture insofar as it relates to me.  We are conditioned to be consumption machines.  Eat more food

5. Compassion for Others....""It is possible people are just a victim of their environment and if you lived their lives you might be the same way.""  Basically the JRE has taught me to not expect people to be how you want the

6. Calmness- For some reason the JRE has taught me about being calm and how you don't have to be an aggro alpha male 24/7.  it might be a martial arts thing (I train BJJ) but I feel like the podcast puts things into perspective and helps me be humble.

The JRE has really helped me to see the good in people and maintain a positive outlook on life.  I am just stunned the dynamic impact this podcast has had on my life on a daily basis.  It might be that Joe and I have similar personalities and had similar personal things to deal with, but I feel like since starting I have evolved into such a better version of myself its scary.

 If Joe or Redban see this- Thanks.  You really are building an army and it really gives me hope for the future knowing about all the listeners that share similar views as me. 

TLDR; The podcast has really had a positive impact on my life to the point its almost shocking.",self,t5_2s4tv,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/JoeRogan/comments/122340/my_joe_rogan_story/

A lot of the stuff he's brought up over the, has been really inspirational to me. He has a definitely opened my mind to a lot of things and I still think he's really good at social commentary and comedy but most of the other topics he touches on makes me cringe these days. There doesn't seem to be as much critical thinking as he claims. Perhaps I shouldn't be so critical and appreciate what he's actually done, his greatest accomplishment - inspiring people to improve their lives, including me. I think it might just be the fact that because he's said so many great things, I've started to hold him to a really high standard and I get dissapointed with a lot of recent developments. 

No idea what this post is even supposed to accomplish. Maybe I've had my share of this. That many hours of a person's point of view might just be enough and maybe I just lost interest or matured or whatever. Without sounding like a fucking huge cunt

Does anyone have any ideas on how to contact Neil Tyson?  Reddit, Ari, Diaz or Redban's attention too?  It really can't be that hard to do.

Full disclosure:  the odds of this happening are near zero but I think we should give it a whirl. Don't be a bunch of pussies and do nothing.  I need your help.  Tweet the shit out of all of them....including NDT.  Someone out there must have Joe and/or NDT following them and in that case you can PM this link.  Hook us up.

I think because I'm actually meeting the needs of my nutrition I now have better control over what I shove in my face. Most days for lunch I have an 800 calorie salad and in the afternoon a 600 calorie TV dinner.

Kale Shake:

* Half a full sized Cucumber
* 3 Large Dino Kale Leaves
* 3 Largish Stalks of Celery
* 1/2 ish cup of Mixed frozen berries
* Chunk of Ginger
* 1 Scoop of ""Garden of Life"" Raw Protien

Also

My breakfast comes to a grand total of 298 calories and I feel good until lunch.

Here's the kicker

I feel like Joe has given me the golden ticket.

2. Make it lengthy

3. Subtle spelling/grammar errors. 'dont tipe lik dis' cause then it will be too obvious.

4. Bonus points if you write about your situation where it starts out as you being a perfect guy and wondering why you are in the mess you're in

I know nobody else probably gives a shit about this but this made my damn month. Seeing people act cool on tv/computer is one thing, comedians, entertainers in general, their job is to make you like them. Their job is to act cool. Actually being that person you portray is another level all together. I used to live in L.A. so I know first hand, some of these ""pretend"" cool mudda fuckas are damn good at it.

In the blog post from 2004 Joe mentions he just hired a ""new guy"" (Redban) to film/document his crazy life.  Joe also has some insight about women's attitude of other women; he conveys his viewpoint by explaining his experience hiring and working with *The Man Show*'s ""juggies"".

I thought this was a very monumental post (in context of the podcast) that needs some recognition.  I had a great time reading it.

But does it bother anyone else that Rogan pretty much suspends all his rules for Dice? I mean the guy blasted Kilstein for challenging someone to a fight.  But yet all Dice talks about is how much of a tough guy he is and how he knocks people out and kicks them out of his shows.  Dice pretty much self promotes him and his son and goes on and on about how much of a hard ass he is.

As a person who promotes:

1. Being Humble
2. Being Nice
3. Non Violence as a Martial Artist
4. Being Positive

Doesn't Dice embody everything that Joe is not and everything Rogan preaches against.  I mean Dice enrages me, let alone another grown man.

He just seems like such a bully and it enrages me.  But I guess Joe could look up to Dice b/c of comedy the way I look up to Joe.  Maybe if I met Rogan and he was saying a bunch of shit I generally don't agree with I would just cheer him on b/c of who he is.

But god Dice sounds like such a horribly intolerable prick and its odd to me Joe doesn't talk some sense into him

Does this bother anyone else?

1345058338.0,y9ynd,Anyone else think Joe has been a little on edge lately?,zambonijonez,63,20,94,"I mean, Adam Kokesh

I was especially disappointed in the Immortal Tech episode because thats a guy that people on his website rallied for forever to get on the show.  I'm not a big fan of IT these days but I grew up listening to him in high school- now that i'm older i find him a bit silly and extreme but i was surprised at how knowledgeable he was on the podcast only to have Joe kinda steamroll him in the interview. ESPECIALLY the rap battle conversation ""why dont they just fight?!""

The Kokesh podcast wasn't as bad as I anticipated after the comments I read but he was acting more as a devils advocate than i've ever seen- asking lots of tough questions without proposing any kind of alternate solution, than overarching themes such as the ones Kokesh brought to the table.  

I haven't listened to the killstein episode but I DID see his Tweet clarifying that they are in fact 'cool' or whatever

Also in the most recent Ice House Chronicles, but it was both random and admitedly ignorant (dont see much of that from joe usually) attitude of just ""fuck that guy"".  

All of this...and then you look at episodes with the sasquach dude and the ancient alien dude and Joe wasn't nearly as skeptical/critical/aggressive towards their ideas

Perhaps its a respect thing- he knows the former guests are more serious about their shit and able to fight harder to solidify their ideas

Maybe with the Duncan/Redban fiasco things are finally reaching a boiling point with Redbans childishness/unlikability? Maybe these kettlebells have been a headache and a half? Maybe his special that he filmed almost 4 months ago isn't moving forward as efficiently as planned?  Maybe it's just that i've listened to about 150 of these shows and I'm getting tired of it...
