1337126764.0,tp3ej,radio reddit is at risk of shutting down. We need your help. ,HarryMuffin,166,16,43,"So here’s the scoop. I apologize that it will be long winded

As you probably know, and operated project. We allow independent reddit musicians to upload their music, and we play it on our streams while users vote on the songs. All for free. More popular songs are played more and vice versa. We also have [talk radio](http://radioreddit.com/listen/#talk) for non music lovers. On the operational side of things, we have for the most part two people. Octatone, and myself (we still get tons of help from everyone).  We do what we do 100% as volunteers and have never received any financial compensation (in fact we started with our own money).  

That being said we are currently hurting very badly right now as far as project funding goes.  At first it was easy and we just covered it out of pocket for the fun of it.  Over the past few years our project has grown exponentially in size causing of course, as lovers of independent music and musicians, asking for help.  

It seems only fair to give a rundown of our current costs. We’ve always been transparent about our operations.  

Per month we currently pay between $100 - $150 USD per month for our main server that runs our transcoding and website. The fluctuation is because sometimes we have overages.  As it stands this is our only monthly recurring cost

This includes: 

* $100 for DMCA compliance
* $350 or so to make us a legal entity
* $100 or so for business registrations
* $46 quarterly for a PO Box
* $99 yearly for an apple dev account to sell the iphone apps (of which we are currently lapsed)
* Various nickel and diming throughout the year

This comes to roughly $2

Our income comes in the form of:

* Ad revenue (you’d be surprised how little we make from this. I think last month we did about 15 bucks. Some months we do only a few dollars
* [Sponsorships from listeners](http://radioreddit.com/sponsor)
* Revenue from iphone apps (of which we still owe a percentage of to the awesome developer

I’m trying really hard to keep this from being a begging post

Here is how you can help:  

* You can put a dollar or two towards a radio reddit sponsorship
* You can help us get the word out there. We need to let people outside of reddit know what we are doing for independent musicians. 
* You can come up with a way to volunteer. We need help with various things
* Ideas. We love ideas. Have a good one? Join with us and let's make it happen.   

If you’ve made it this far, we encourage you to begin voting on what you don't like to build the ultimate stream that is a reflection of what everyone as a whole likes hearing.

1324780081.0,npqq6,radioreddit will be moving its domain names from GoDaddy as well. Here's why. ,HarryMuffin,53,7,5,"I'm sure you've all noticed by now the big buzz on reddit regarding Go Daddy's support of SOPA.  For those of you who don't know about SOPA please [read up on the basics of it](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act).  In a nutshell

We have a small voice but we want to start by joining to movement to transfer our domain from SOPA supporter Go Daddy.  While they have changed their point of view after everything hit the fan

Let me lay out what radio reddit is. radio reddit is a free music service made by musicians that wanted like minded individuals' music to be heard. The few of us that run and develop things are unpaid volunteers that are not especially thrilled with the way the music industry is being run and where it is headed.  We feel that the listeners should be able to decide what should be heard by themselves and others. And we feel that musicians should in turn, no sniffing coke on the mixing board while making a backroom deal (well for most of us). ** All music uploaded by radio reddit goes through a strict upload process that guarantees that the music is owned by the individual uploading it.** 

**Now let me explain where SOPA would be bad for radio reddit**  

Let me show an example that explains things in the most simplistic terms.  Say we have a user that uploads music to our [upload page](http://radioreddit.com/uploading). This user agrees to our terms of service that they are the copyright holder of this song and that they exclusively own the rights to broadcasting and give us permission to replay said song(s), we volunteers that run the website are now subject to a maximum of 5 years of prison for each 10 violations within six months. In essence we risk being heavily punished as well as our families, for having an opportunity for struggling musicians.  

This is only a small example of the harm that this bill can do. Not only independent projects like radio reddit, etc etc... The damage would be widespread. I'm sorry if I sound like I'm on a soap box (sopa box?) and what I'm saying here doesn't necessarily fall under radio reddit's official stand, but I think that our side of the story needs to be heard.

We are a small group of volunteers that run and operate the Radio Reddit platform.  

Radio Reddit was founded in 2009 by users of /r/wearethemusicmakers.  We operate the website http://radioreddit.com which allows reddit based artists and bands to upload their music to be heard by the masses in the forms of radio streams, and on demand plays for free. In other words, we are not reddit, though we are officially recognized.  We do this for the love of music. 

We give artists and bands a fair chance to be heard and recognized.  For example, we do not profit personally from this. We do this in our spare time despite families and full time jobs.  We pride ourselves on getting deserving artists heard as much as possible.  In addition to our base services, we offer Radio Reddit Live.  This allows bands to stream live using our system.  This also gives the ability for Live DJ’s to broadcast curated content, such as what we broadcast on Friday nights on our main stream. 

**How we work on the inside**

We used the reddit API's and available code to develop a system that tracks songs using [/r/radioreddit](/r/radioreddit) as well as matching entries in our own database that tracks reddit urls, scores, tags, rr username, reddit username, plays, and on and on and on.  

Using these scores (i.e. upvotes that we track on reddit AND our database) we build a custom playlist for each of our music streams on the hour.  Higher voted songs have more of a chance of being played

Artists also have the ability to see how many times their songs have been listened to, along with timestamps.  

**Humble beginnings**  

When we started we literally had an ftp site and a computer in my living room broadcasting a single stream of randomized songs.  Now we have 3 servers in high end data centers across the world.  The first Radio Reddt broadcast literally involved me kicking off the event from a computer hooked to my TV while I was drinking beer.  We hit the max limit of listeners 10 minutes before the stream even started

Talented individuals flocked towards the project and help build a workable prototype pretty quick, despite us fearing a shut down message or scolding. Truly, reddit staff are awesome people. 

**Where is Radio Reddit headed?**  

An excellent question! I am glad you asked.  We are currently working on version 2.0.  It is going to take into account all of the things we’ve learned along the way.  We’ve gotten many critiques and praises and we’ve listened to every single one along the way.  

We plan on delivering a personalized user experience for each listener that allows them to have the option of a Pandora type experience

We are currently rebuilding from scratch in Python over Pyramid.  We have some pretty solid mockups that I will post shortly.  Also

In addition to the website changes we plan on releasing more “Best Of Radio Reddit” CDs and downloadable albums.  Our goal is to have a Radio Reddit Records where talented artists and musicians can publish albums on the cheap and distribute to a widespread audience.

* There is a spot on our website where typing in the Konami Code will make nutzoid things happen.
* We should be ashamed of what goes on in our chatroom. It really livens up on Friday nights during the live DJ shows.
* Even though we have minimal subscribers

Once they are links in our subreddit, less popular songs are lowered and eventually phased out.

* The first radio reddit t-shirt is coming to help fund our growing server requirements.  It is  designed by the awesome [licenseplate](http://www.reddit.com/user/licenseplate) (the person that made the RedditGifts and Reddit meme poster) and will be available VERY soon.  

* Our playlist is almost up to 3

* Our new relay servers are up that were generously donated by [Radixcloud](http://www.radixcloud.com) and [Exoware](http://www.exoware.net).  Now we can support tons of listeners world-wide. (not to be confused with our main server

* The stream is quite self-sufficient now.  Songs that get x amounts of downvotes are ranked lower and thus receive less time in the streams. Songs that get higher amounts of upvotes are given higher playing priorities.  All songs remain available for voting regardless of status.  

* A second stream is happening for Talk radio reddit.  We have a few reddit users lined up to do hour long talk shows for the stream.  If you are interested

Please understand this project is just a few of us that are reddit users and all of our funding comes from donations.  If we are to keep this going we all need to work together. If you enjoy it let us know. If you don't, the reddit admins are aware of all of this and we clear everything by them first.

With this we've had a large increase in bandwidth usage which has resulted in large overages in our bill for FOUR out of the last four months.  Here is a breakdown of our dedicated server costs plus overages for the past four months:  

&gt;05/12 - 119.60  
&gt;06/12 - 141.00  
&gt;07/12 - 159.60  
&gt;08/12 - 178.00  

It is easy to see where this is headed. 

***[We have come up with a way to offset these rising costs

reddit Inc has recently partnered with Crowdtilt.com and we will be using them to raise funds for our new ""Best of Radio Reddit"" monthly releases. The releases will feature all of the top voted songs of the month from [our charts](http://radioreddit.com/charts). Here's the plan:

We will be trying to raise a total of $250.00 for the Best of Radio Reddit August Edition. This will cover the increased cost to host these downloads.  Those who make a $10.00 (or more) contribution will receive a lossless audio version of the release, and once the project meets its goal, it ""tilts"" and the contributors are charged.  If the project does not tilt, then nothing is charged.

If this all works out we will try something similar with a long-term goal and more perks for contributors.  

**Here is the important part for all RR musicians.**  On your ""My Songs"" page you will now see an ""OPT-IN"" button. This is you giving us consent to release all of your songs as part of the Best Ofs.  You will also see a button on each song's edit page allowing the same

Congratulations radio redditor!  
   

The users have spoken by voting at http://radioreddit.com/charts . One of your tracks has been selected to be part of ""Radio Reddit'sBest Of"" release for the year 2012.  We would like to include you in this first annual release in a series of many. 

If you would like to participate
* Please log into your account at http://radioreddit.com/?q=user/login  
* Go to your ""My Songs"" page at http://radioreddit.com/?q=my_songs  
* Edit your songs and mark them as ""Releasable""  

Respond to this e-mail if you want to participate and we will e-mail you a place to upload the track. We will need a lossless audio track in FLAC
 
Our main goal is to have your music heard by listeners. This ""Best Of"" release will help distribute your track to our fan base, and trademarks. We do plan on distributing this in hard copy CD for hard copy release to help us with operational costs, and to give a portion of the proceeds to Vh1's Save The Music Campaign, which is fighting to put musical education back in the classroom. We also plan on distributing this in high quality downloadable formats.  We want to be up front with that so you're aware that the individuals that run Radio Reddit aren't profiting off of your music (we are volunteers), and that we cannot offer monetary compensation for artists (yet!).  

Please note that we are contacting the artists from the top 25 tracks as we know that not everyone will respond or want to be included. We will be including roughly 20 artists

If you have any questions

Here is a spreadsheet of the tracks that we'd like to include in our release so that you know which song we are referring to:  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AhzqX9HP7mvtdFZxYkFLOUhoSEdtbFA2ak5RTndiVVE

Last week we put a few posts around reddit and on Google+ looking for people to volunteer for some positions that would help offload some work from octatone and I's workload (just to clarify we are also volunteers that have our own specialties that we'd like to focus on).  We received quite a few applications and every single one of them were by great people who were obviously highly motivated.  We had two guys whose submissions stood out and we'd like to introduce them:  

**Andrew**: radio reddit's new Social Networking Coordinator.  Andrew will be taking care of getting radio reddit's news around outside of reddit

**Aaron**: radio reddit's new Video Coordinator.  Aaron will be coordinating with reddit artists and bands to get their music videos and live performances onto our various video outlets (coming soon).  This will allow you to watch radio reddit as well as listen to it.  

So please welcome them aboard!  Also

This is a preview of an iPhone app for radio reddit that I've been working on for some weeks now.
After many hours it's finally nearing version 1.0 and will soon be sent to Apple for approval. 
There are some minor things to fix before that

In version 1.0 you can:

- listen to the different streams
- log in with your reddit account and upvote/downvote/submit songs
- bookmark songs (1)
- view the 20 latest songs you've heard on the radio (2)
- view the top 10 charts of all time/month/week and day (3)
- replay/play/vote on songs in 1
- use the remote on the headphones to play/pause/change stream
- on iOS4 there's multitasking and you can use the ""iPod controls"" in the multitask bar to play/pause/change stream.

The plan right now is to release two versions
The paid one is the one you saw in the video and the differences between that and the free version are the bookmarking/chart/recently played -features.
The paid version will also help support radio reddits costs for broadcasting.

I started programming this some weeks ago when I first discovered radio reddit. 
I wanted an iPhone app and it was only meant for my own pocket at first
I'm quite thrilled and really

What do you think?

 All uploads must be the property of the contributor. If you didn't create it, we won't approve it for play or entry into our database.

 Because we are receiving hundreds of uploads a week now we do not have the resources/manpower to scrutinize and research every single track. We are all volunteers here and have lives outside of this project. So if there is a sample in your track that we have any doubts about, please bring it to our attention so we can straighten it out for you.

 We are also noticing that at some point in the past a few tracks got past our upload standards. We ask that if you happen across any of these tracks please bring it to the attention of the mods so we can delete it from the database. Please include as much information about the track as possible

1279568982.0,crc1z,Announcing the new Radio Reddit playlist algorithm,octatone,19,4,3,"Last week we quietly switched over from our completely randomly generated genre show playlists over to a weighted algorithm that inserts popular songs (most upvotes) within the genre at a given frequency.
  

This *does not* mean you will hear the same up voted song many times during an hour.  What it means is that we are defining probabilities so that a highly upvoted song will be next in the queue.


Currently we have it set that 1 out of every 4 songs is an above average song for the genre.  The average is calculated at playlist generation from all the songs that match the genre.  We do not set what constitutes a good song


The other thing we are doing is setting a lower limit for what constitutes a ""bad"" song as defined by your down votes.  We have it set pretty low and currently only one song is being excluded at playlist generation.


In case none of what you just read makes any sense

(If all goes as planned) [radioreddit](http://radioreddit.com/) will host a dedicated ""holiday music"" stream, but that's only speculation at this point, and your ideas are welcome.  

You still own your tunes

So, of course).  Parody songs are fine too.

Thanks for reading!  ",self,t5_2rb6n,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/radioreddit/comments/12kl3q/a_very_reddit_holiday_album/

**The new order is as follows:**

Best and new are the same as before.  Rising is song score &gt; 1/2 the playlist's average score.  Normal is now any song with a score from -5 to 1/2 the playlists average score.

This change makes it so that there are always at least two good songs before a potential less than stellar song is played.  It also promotes songs with scores that are rising towards greatness.

First I'd like to thank Johncub for his spectacular work on the database back end.  Thanks to him We have the ability to connect users to tracks/genres/reddit username/album name/making track available for download

* The ability for users to upload their tracks and mark them as ""downloadable"".  
* Scheduled playlists.  We can now pre-program playlists to play certain genres of music at certain times.  Example. If at 8pm on a Wednesday we want a show that plays folk/banjo metal/polka country... we can do that. It pulls all the genre information from the database.
* A Calendar that shows playlists and shows.  You will see what playlists and shows are going to play ahead of time. Eventually this will tie into DJ shows as well so you know what is going to happen ahead of time.
* Podcast.  We will be tying the genre based/show based playlists into podcasts so that you can download the shows automatically as the show ends.

As you may or may not know we are a project made up solely of volunteer reddit users.  After the reddit.com staff became aware of us

This is important for many reasons. Most importantly

Also, etc...  

In other words, and collectively OUR voice is being heard.  

Here is the obligatory ""uh-oh"": As we are a community run project, etc.. but we fund ourselves for servers, licenses, etc. What this means is if we don't make enough in a month to cover , two of us do it out of pocket.  So if you'd like to help you can:

____________________________________________________________  
 
 ============================================================
:: 1. Editors note:
============================================================  
 
Here it is
happening with radio reddit and we hope that this will be the first of many..the
beginning of an era..the force that pushed...well
way since our humble beginnings in December of '09 and are confident that we have 
put down a solid foundation for which to grow.  
 
We've gone from an idea
to a three server wide internet radio station that allows users to create the stream
by voting up what they like
project has the blessing of reddit.com and its admins
project that is run and funded by its own users.  
 
It is important to note everyone that has allowed this idea to get to where it is now
as they have all put invaluable work into the project:  
 
octatone: programmer / wizard / admin  
 
johncub: donated great code and programming time to the website's functionality  
 
licenseplate: artist with the speed and accuracy of a robot  
 
eogprod: overseer of the upload track approval que  
 
#radioreddit irc channel people: (pie_mage,psyingo,omnishadowtopia..trust me 
it is worth joining in the chat just to see this guy in action.. he is one of a kind
 
RadixCloud and Exoware for donating VPS's to lighten the load.   
 
Everyone else that knows how much they are appreciated.   
 
                                     -harrymuffin (pextris@radioreddit.com)
============================================================
:: 2. Rock Meme fundraising T-shirt
============================================================  
 
The Rock Meme fundraising T-shirt is now available for purchase. The shirt was 
designed by licenseplate and is available at http://radioreddit.com/rock_meme_tshirt
The shirt can be shipped anywhere in the U.S. as well as internationally.  The shirt
is meant to help us pay for our ever-growing server needs so please buy one if you 
can. It is VERY important to understand that the T-shirts are currently on a pre-order
basis. Once   
 
 ============================================================
:: 3. Separate electronic music stream
============================================================  
 
Due to the huge amount of electronic/techno/DnB uploads
secondary stream for just electronic music.  This will also be a test run to see how
multiple streams for different genres are received by listeners.  To check out the 
""Beats and Turnips"" electronic music stream you can tune in at:
http://www.radioreddit.com/listen/electronic .  
 
 ============================================================
:: 4. Current server costs
============================================================  
 
As it stands our current server bill is 90 dollars per month. This gives us a server in 
a very reliable facility with root access,
160GB HD with total redundancy and backups
and 2TB of bandwidth per month.  This is very much necessary to handle all of our 
stream transcoding/stream output/web server
 
As mentioned before
by the community. If you are interested in helping the cause so that we can 
sustain and grow
http://www.radioreddit.com/donate or by buying a Rock Meme fundraiser shirt at
http://www.radioreddit.com/rock_meme_tshirt    
 
 ============================================================
:: 5. Advertising
 ============================================================  

We  are now offering low cost advertising space on radioreddit.com . If you 
are a reddit artist or band that is interested in promoting your band/project/show
please e-mail admin@radioreddit.com . We can put you in the ad loop for a very
minimal donation.  After all
