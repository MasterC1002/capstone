&gt;I am part of an advertising company. My team has manufactured numerous front page posts over the past 2 years. Already, or a submission that starts with ""Look who I found when I went to see the DKR this weekend!"". We are also allowed to screen the film early to pick out plot points that would be ripe for a ""Scumbag Batman"" or ""Scumbag Bane"" type meme, so we can plop those up immediately following the films release.

&gt;In order to do this, gaining karma steadily, so it's not rejected by the community when ""they"" submit their advertising. Sometimes I think this contributes to the banality of this website.

I have been lurking on reddit for over a year now and I have noticed that these Conan joke reposts are FREQUENTLY and CONSISTENTLY hitting the front page capping out at around 2100 upvotes per post. This is not a recent occurrence.

These posts are very quick to amass a bunch of upvotes

On [THIS POST](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1icfb0/well_definitely_he_is/) by user /u/romz7 it has currently gotten 2237 upvotes. I posted a comment when it was at 1200 upvotes and within 20 minuites it had broken the 2000 mark. 

[Another Conan Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1i9hnm/conan_explains_the_obvious/) hit the front page yesterday and has 2037 upvotes with only 160 comments.

so within two days two Conan posts have made the front page with minimal comments.

[heres one from 4 days ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1i1sjs/conan_is_excellent/) 2772 upvotes but comments are at 700 here. 

Those are just recent ones

A commenter has told me that these images all look similar as they are posted by the Conan social media team and are then being posted and reposted here. 

I am not alone in this as another redditor by the name of /u/AltRedditAcc replied to my comment saying  

&gt;""I've seen countless of other submissions reaching frontpage with ~2k upvotes and near no comments
Definitly bought upvotes. There's no way thousand people upvote without commenting and then suddenly everyone stops lurking.
I'm actually surprised noone brings that up ever... until now.""

As I finish typing this post the first post by /u/romz7 is now at 2600 in this very short time. 

I am afraid I might need more concrete proof but this issue should be brought to reddits attention. /r/adviceanimals did not tolerate quickmeme gaming them and /r/funny should not tolerate Conan's either.


 

**UPDATE:17th July**

Hello everyone. Thanks for all all the views and comments

* Firstly a few Conan fans are saying it doesn't matter because he is funny. I am british so I am unbiased in my opinion of him as I do not watch his show

* From what I can tell the posts are not being by bots but rather regular redditors. This means that the posters are not associated to the PR team and usually have no idea about it. A possible scenario could be that bots scan and find these Conan joke images and give them a shot of upvotes to increase their visibility and have other normal redditors do the rest. These bots probably bugged out which is why you sometimes see mass upvotes or downvotes on random posts/comments.

* /u/romz7 replied telling us what happened regarding his post. 
&gt;I have no idea about the bots voting or anything but yes it was the first time any of my posts got up voted in such a short period of time. I was at about 100 up votes in the first hour and then by two and half hours I was almost on the front page. After that

* Redditor /u/Wylye claims this sort of thing is happening on other sites too. Heres his quote.
&gt;I've seen it happening on other sites as well. Fark.com always seems to have at least active TeamCoco branded link in their video tab per week

* Another redditor claims that Ellen posts are also being botted

* I was told to present my evidence in /r/KarmaCourt 

Finally

In 2011 YouTube was getting played by various gaming commentators who ran game giveaways in exchange for likes and favs. This caused the site's homepage to be plagued by terrible videos as the influx of likes/faves pushed it to the front page for a week

I despise advertising but am also intrigued by the psychology of it at the same time. The Reddit model is ingenious because it creates very specialized pools of target markets, although pizza/soda is incredibly bad for you, when a subscriber sees Pizza Hut and Mountain Dew in /r/gaming it helps move the consumer to see past the negative effects as 'it's part of gaming culture' and I subscribe to that.

So what CAN reddit do in light of the ""any press is good press"" marketers in the post-Oreo-superbowl world?

Here is one idea: counter-posting. Photoshopping. Evolving the Streisand effect to include attempted corporate messages

HOW?  Much like the popular [FIXED] posts that pop up all over reddit

Example: take the suspiciously good-looking [pretzel bun](http://www.reddit.com/r/HailCorporate/comments/1hwhqp/i_know_this_isnt_instagram_but_god_damn_wendys/) image and photoshop some maggots in it. Post it with a story about you were REALLY hungry for some Wendy's&amp;trade Brand Food... UNTIL THE HORROR!

I'd still like to research those that I've marked with italics. What I'd especially want to do is to find legitimate accounts that aren't very active and compare them against the less active accounts that are suspected shills. Also things like verified e-mail adresses and such among shills and non-shills would be interesting

I think we should do more digging into these accusations

Here is why HailCorporant fails to accomplish what it aims to do.

1.  HailCorporate by its very nature can only focus on larger companies
 
2.  Larger companies have no motivation to advertise covertly on places like reddit.  Large companies have established products, which redditors were more than happy to embrace and [create endless memes to promote the product](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/isaiah-mustafa-old-spice)

3.  Because of the first two

4.  Hailcorporate has a political blind-spot, climate change, creationist, gay marriage, and ""birther"" conspiracies, the same is true for left leaning websites.  Author and skeptic [Michael Shermer noted in Scientific American](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-liberals-war-on-science), that the left also has its anti-rational bias'.   

5.  Finally

What this means in practice is that advocacy for left-leaning causes are given a pass

How to fix the problem:

*  The focus should be who posts threads

*  Separating out business advocacy vs science advocacy/debunking.   Nobody is paid to debunk pseudoscience on the internet

*  Recognize that debunking false claims isn't advocacy.  For example

*  Focus on evidence instead of emotional appeals.  Nobody really cares if people are using social media to advertise because it comes with the territory.  The real issues is: are the claims true. 

***

A good rule of thumb:  ""You should be most skeptical of those claims you like because you are sufficiently skeptical of those you don't.


***

Edit 1:  It looks like hurt feelings are dominating the downvote buttons in the comments

***

Edit 2:  As someone noted.  Why is the issue PAID advocacy?  Shouldn't the focus be on the validity of claims?  Teachers are paid to promote facts and evidence

It is the same with contentions issues on reddit.  You have activists who make false claims and you have people debunking them

***

Edit 3:  It is amazing how quickly dissent is downvoted no matter how mild.  It is validation of my claim that this is just a variation of /r/conspiracy (or more like a religious cult)",,t5_2t1sc,1373259723.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/HailCorporate/comments/1hrvwa/why_hailcorporate_is_failing_in_it_mission_and/

I agree that many of the increasingly frequent ads on Reddit's front page are probably not by advertising companies.  

However

A user dedicating their attention, reflects either paid work or a disgusting lack of creativity, both of which should be called out.

This subreddit has been under attack lately. A few blatant ads have fallen flat in the past

Critics are often popular because they appear to be battling the ""status quo

In this subreddit there have been quite a few of the tired ""This subreddit sucks I'm unsubbing because you people have no PROOF that these ads are being made by advertisers!"" posts.
This is a great example of a damage control tactic to discredit your detractors.  They've accused this subreddit of being guilty of something that it never claimed to be.    

Even in the sidebar of this subreddit it states:
&gt;""This...reddit is in large part about documenting the fact that reddit really is used for viral and native marketing. Yet also to highlight the fact that regular people are doing the work of advertisers.""

There is no need for any kind of proof that an Advertisement has been paid for! An advertisement is an advertisement, Calling out a front page post as an advertisement is the purpose of this subreddit.

The comments in [this recent post](http://www.reddit.com/r/HailCorporate/comments/1dqp9g/robinsons_fruit_drink_ad_hits_front_page_of/) in particular made me sick.  It appears that the detractors have reached criticial mass.  The dimwitted

As for being a ""downvote brigade"" I'm all for it. Get that product-worship bullshit off my front page! Why shouldn't we be downvoting advertisements which take up our time and attention?

I propose that the moderators in this sub start battling the effort to undermine this subreddit. Delete the comments which marginalize or detract from the post. Delete the whining ""I'm unsubbing! someone pay attention to me!"" posts.  Tell people, or whether the advertisement is any ""good"" or not.  

Also
""What? You didn't like that ad! It had a great concept! Put away your pitchforks! This is just a witch hunt subredditt!!!!11!""

Since when was this subreddit only allowed to criticize poorly done

Edit: Many people have taken issue with my ""downvote brigade"" comment

If reddit wants to discourage organized downvoting then they will have to shut down the meta subreddits, but that's another topic.  

Comment AND downvote, just be redditors and downvote crummy ad posts.  If reddit admins start scolding us for that then I'm finding another website.

I know this subreddit has grown hugely but also taken a lot of crap due to so-called ""witch-hunts"".  Seems to me we're doing the right thing

**So the problem isn't that companies are here

**Solution?  Companies pay for ads.**  They go in the ad space.  Minions, put them up in the ad space.  

If companies are clever, the companies, pay something to reddit to help support the site.  Then its more out in the open, less insidious, and actually means they're helping rather than hurting the community.

I think this might give us something to propose as a solution rather than just trying to chase these no-good-nicks outta town.  I think instead of saying ""get the fuck off reddit

The next one...http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1fshi9/concerning_that_mcdonalds_sign_your_friend_saw/

Now the commenters are *thrilled* to talk about McDonald's food. OP seems maybe genuine but his replies sound like marketing.

&gt;As an employee at Mcdonald's I can say that in my time there (about 9 months) I have made 5 Mcgangbangs

......
&gt;I introduced the McGangbang to my kids and they love it, we call it the McBarnyard. Extra points if you add the fillings of the $1 sausage McMuffin into it, with the egg under the chicken patty of course. You you have bread, beef, pork(?) sausage, cheese, bread, bread

**tl;dr; harassing people you think are marketers is not ok**

------------------------------------------------

**Boring Pedantic Introduction**

When I was a kid my grandfather brought me some textbooks he had found in his building's lending library. One of them was about marketing, which is the definition of marketing:

&gt;[**Marketing** is the process of communicating the value of a product or service to customers... From a societal point of view

(The cynical among you might point out that that's just how marketers choose to market marketing. Humor me.)

Marketing is about getting information to people about things they don't yet know could help them. We're all marketers, but nevertheless it could well be that there's someone out there for which it just clicked that a red tam tam stool would perfectly fill the void they have between their recliner and television. That's marketing.

Another example: sex-ed is marketing for condoms. Teenagers don't know why they need condoms, hopefully, kids come to understand why condoms are like totally cool man.
We need marketing, both on reddit and off reddit.

**Hate. Hate.**

Then why do we [hate marketers?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDW_Hj2K0wo) Is it just if they're getting paid for it? We don't hate the editors of [Rock Paper Shotgun](http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/) or [Cigar Aficionado

Really

Why?

Advertisers have little incentive to give accurate information. They don't care whether we actually need shit, how the fuck? Because they bought a ton of ad space at a time when it was cheap to do so. [And that's probably the least harmful example I could come up with.](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lvcj8mpC4M1r48zyio1_400.jpg) They create needs to fit products rather than vice-versa.

Normally you'd think, you just gotta pump in more dosh and you get [the Rosetta Stone effect](http://www.caseycheshire.com/the-rosetta-stone-effect/) Advertising makes everything harder to trust, even non-advertisers. Especially on reddit, where my two friends could have just sold their accounts to an advertiser and there'd be no way to know.

They have a much bigger voice than you or me. On TV this is a given. It didn't used to be true on the internet but now it obviously is. And on reddit this used to be ridiculous

And they're getting a free ride. I won't be sending a bill to RPS or CA for their previous mentions, you don't just grab a handful. That's what advertisers are doing when try to use ""social media"" or ""seo"" or ""word of mouth"". They're saying, instead of whatever you would normally talk about at lunch, you could make us money if you were talking about our product. Instead of what you'd normally see on the front page, we'd make money if you saw an [Oreo ad.](http://www.shopify.com/blog/7589919-the-secret-behind-oreos-social-media-marketing) So we'll put one there. And you'll like it. And it'll be cheaper than buying one of those stupid ads on the sidebar that nobody looks at.

These are [not](http://betabeat.com/2013/02/hail-corporate-the-increasingly-insufferable-fakery-of-brands-on-reddit/) [unreasonable](http://www.dailydot.com/society/reddit-hire-spam-ian-miles-cheong-sollnvictus/) [concerns.](http://www.slideshare.net/viralseeding/viral-seeding-creds-2011)

**Not so bad?**

But sometimes we are unreasonable about them. If you google ""reddit marketing""
Check it out:

[""create engagement through content creation... provide something of obvious and proven value to the community you are marketing to on reddit... the only marketing that the content should do is give credit to the creator of the content.""](http://www.blueglass.com/blog/how-to-market-on-reddit/)

[""Be a redditor first

[""Gnip pulling public posts from Instagram

[""Have respect, provide value""](http://tristanbarnum.com/pitfalls-of-marketing-on-reddit/)

All in all, these are also the small fry. What we have been seeing lately is not infographics or 10 greatest x listblog spam like plagued digg, but just weird, honestly just very weird amounts of praise for corporations from a website that used to have to world's hugest hate-on for them. Maybe these are not the marketers we're looking for.

**No conclusions

[What have we learned from this?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQQdSwFgSec)

Everyone's a marketer.

1365289601.0,1btllo,This sub has gotten out of hand [petition to moderators for some reform],spevak,265,110,80,"If you agree that this subreddit needs a change


So at this point I think a lot of you will agree with me that the content on this subreddit has become very low quality.  Almost every single post's comments contain some argument over whether the post should be here


In my opinion, but there is a huge difference between a post meant solely to glorify a product, and a picture where there happens to be a logo visible somewhere that isn't even the focus of the post.  For me, the part of the sidebar description that most accurately and concisely sums up what I expect from this subreddit is the very last bit:
&gt;rampant consumerism as companies harness the persuasive power of social media

In particular, people think it's such  a big deal.  If you would take it in step in real life, I don't think it belongs here.  I'm not *disagreeing* with the claim that these things are cases of consumerism, but they're completely unremarkable.  Yes, we live in a consumerist society.  Yes, we know, people drop brand names all the time in casual conversation.  But that's not the point of this subreddit. I'm here to see how ""compaines harness the persuasive power of social media.""  It's no surprise that people are going to use brand names on the internet just like they do in real life; what's worth documenting here is how the internet is opening up NEW ways of advertising.  What belongs here is when marketers abuse the viral nature of Reddit content to promote a product


Another thing that doesn't belong here is comical posts.  If a brand is mentioned satirically or as part of a joke, it hurts them.  I've seen several posts here that were clearly cases of companies being made fun of.  Comical posts don't belong here. 


Ok, please propose them in the comments.  As for me, I think the best solution would be an approved submitter list.  To get on the list, you would have to have your first post approved by a moderator.  Furthermore, people should be able to flag posts they don't think belong here, and if an approved submitter has too many bad posts, they'll be removed from the list.  This will essentially prevent people from coming here on a whim and contributing to the logo-spotting circlejerk.  The sub will still be visible to everyone, but only people who understand what this sub is about and are committed to maintaining a high quality of content will be able to post.  


Lastly, and if things remain the way they are I won't be here for much longer.  I think a lot of people here share this sentiment.  ",,False,,t5_2t1sc,False,,

Bear with me here

Created a throwaway for this cause I don't want this mixed in on my regular account. I use that for my daily Redditing. Reddit is my main source of entertainment on the internet and I love it. I come here for fun and to learn things like the day-to-day use of the English language. So I rarely visit subreddits about things that are likely to annoy me like news

You've probably noticed these brands that have been advertising on Reddit A LOT in the past few months:

Doritos &lt; Frito-Lay &lt; **PepsiCo**

Tostitos &lt; Frito-Lay &lt; **PepsiCo**

Mountain Dew &lt; Pepsi-Cola &lt; **PepsiCo**

Pizza Hut &lt; **Yum! Brands**

Taco Bell &lt; **Yum! Brands**

Yum! Brands is a spin-off company from PepsiCo. It is an independed company now

I don't think all of these posts are separate ads. Some of them are

Ever wonder why Reddit, Reddit is one of those media companies that sells ad campaigns.**

**Reddit sells businesses frontpage posts that are guaranteed to get thousands

And I ain't even mad. I have worked in media for a few years. I've sold ad space that people came across while reading magazines and by seeing billboards. **Ads are annoying

**A lot of people in this sub have been asking what the goal of /r/HailCorporate is.** I think that should be it. To get Reddit to be honest about posts clearly being paid advertisements. So we know Reddit needs them to pay the bills and to exist. And we know we just have to accept them for that. 

Or if they are *not* ads, we can enjoy Reddits great content that is put there by its users, and *not* see brand names everywhere.",,False,,t5_2t1sc,,http://www.reddit.com/r/HailCorporate/comments/16cmuj/pepsico_yum_brands_and_reddits_frontpage/

Much of the time it is easy to see when a user is an astroturfer by the details of their account and their posting history. Often in advertisement posts brands will be very clearly and prominently displayed; they will be large and conspicuous

I’m a media communications associate for a small Columbus- based business. We’ve never interacted with reddit before but we're considering it now; specifically to reply to people that talk about us or are interested in what we do (in the subreddits that relate to our industry).

I already posed a question like this on 'ASKREDDIT' but then thought I'd get more passionate and knowledgeable responses here.
I reddit outside of work so know how things generally work but I've never really thought about companies on reddit.

""Is there ever an appropriate way for businesses to honestly get involved with reddit"" i.e. not astroturfing

Does anyone know of any other companies already doing this (outside of all the obvious astro-turfers?

I did a search for links submitted with neurope.eu as the URL and came up with plenty of results http://www.reddit.com/domain/neurope.eu/ Now the interesting thing is how many of those links were submitted by brand new users with no previous posting history

http://www.reddit.com/user/YoWix

http://www.reddit.com/user/Ninja_Jam

http://www.reddit.com/user/JarHeadDude

http://www.reddit.com/user/JackZipLi

http://www.reddit.com/user/EuroDingo

And those are just out of the first 15 results on the search by domain. There are 5+ spam brand new account submissions to every regular poster linking to neurope. I am sure if you keep going down you will see more of the same. New accounts with only one post link to neurope,ciciazqm and so on. In RES you can hold your mouse over the usernames on the domain search results page and see how many of them linking to neurope had never posted before or again after submitting that one link. 

So is it neurope trying to get hits, but as we can see today every so often one of their submitters with a brand new account makes the front page and drives to them tons of traffic.

For a longer read on the same subject see the recent [mod post bu joke-away](http://www.reddit.com/r/HailCorporate/comments/1cabtn/mod_post_my_two_cents/) or read this:



&gt;There are a few things we need to go over. 

#####[](//.) We get a lot of confusion over people who don't read the sidebar or who think we are about something different than we are. We are about showing posts that act as ads.####

   The world around us is filled with advertisements: radio, digital media, billboards, et cetera. The internet is no exception and it is well known that ads already have present on the internet. The president of the USA interacted with this website, so you have to know is not unknown. When you get something to the front page of reddit that can get hundreds of thousands of views or more, why would someone who is trying to market something not want to utilize this for their benefit?

   There are many types of advertising that happen at all times, [Guerrilla marketing ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrilla_marketing), and many other concepts and ideas to build brand awareness. Whether you like it or not, just seeing things is enough for them to be processed by your brain, and as you see things repeatedly you become more aware of that thing.  

  Long ago reddit really was different, before Imgur, before the Digg exodus, when reddit was more about science and technology and less about pictures. Since then, as the user base grew reddit has come to be manipulated by and attempted to be manipulated by many people, yet  reddit.com has still held quite strong had still strives to keep a vigilant watch and to not let the spammers take foot. But the fact is that ads do get through, no matter how you interpret them as there are many examples of people successfully working the reddit system to get their content on the front page. And in the origin of this subreddit I just wanted to document it, but until we come up with something better we will continue with the same path. 

 **For these reasons things that mention, or talk about companies, corporations, products, logos, merchandise, entertainment shows/movies, for a number of reasons. **This does not mean that everyone who posts something that mentions anything that is sellable is an astroturfing corporate paid shill who farms karma and manipulates their IP address.** In fact it is a sad reality that this corporate culture is so ingrained into our society that many people post things that act as ad with no idea they are doing so; so pelase don't get out your pitchforks or be rude to others ^(We don't want to have to ban anyone but we will if it comes to it).

For example this thread: http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1b3obw/one_of_the_most_awesome_ideas_ever_hello_europe/

Okay

These people are not asking for the people's money. These people are not asking for funding through governments of the countries in question. They reject the idea of crowdfunding. They don't respond to questions why they don't use crowdfunding. (They even simply remove such suggestions wherever they can.)

These people are explicitly asking for a private sponsor. They are explicitly asking for corporate support.


Why not use crowdsourcing? Well

I want to make this absolutely clear: They reject public funding of their project while at the same time trying to raise awareness and support among the population. They ask for a corporate sponsor to finance their project who will definitely be rewarded by *at least* having his name on that screen. And it will be legitimized by people being indoctrinated into loving that idea and then the corporate sponsor will get a huge PR boost for being so generous and amazing for investing into such a social project by that small independent group of people.

I just want this post to be seen in this subreddit so that I can eventually tell everyone ""I fucking told you so"" when these things 'accidentally' happen to turn into screens playing adverts for their chosen corporate sponsor. 


tl;dr: I predict this is gonna be a giant ad screen playing ads in public in major cities with the ""corporate sponsor"" not having to pay advertising costs because they erected this public ""social"" monument for intercultural communication.

You're on the internet.  Part of the brilliance of a site like reddit is that it has reached an critical mass of tens of millions of daily active users.  There are going to be lots of idiots who

There will also be people who created an account who did nothing with it but defend some company/product three times in a week and then quit.  That's pretty normal behavior.  One of the main things that prompts people to create an account is when, accounts like that are common because you can have as many accounts as you want.  Because you don't have to use a real name on reddit, people will make an account (which takes less than 30 seconds) when they don't want to use their main one to take an unpopular or odd position.

I think its part of the sickness that we all care about that the very mention of the name of a product induces its effect.  You and I can't talk specifics without using the exact magical word 'they' spend so long to craft full of special meaning.  This I believe is the nature of the culture of hailcorporate

What I know and mean is that the other day I read the words 'Taco Bell' and though oh hey I have money and they are pretty close and I want to be lazy and...

My suggestion is that we remove the capitol letters from the products we discuss here.  Such a thing seems to have less psychological power.  What do you see as being more attention grabbing?  'Reddit' or 'reddit' ?  Capitalization is a form of respect granting and its in your and my best interest to remove respect from these products that flood the rest of our culture and lives.

Upon visiting /r/cost I noticed it was laced with Amazon Affiliate links to all sorts of junk, while others not doing so. Diving into one moderator's or commenter's comment history lead me down a rabbit hole of even more subreddits that they had name-dropped. This process repeated ad nauseum.

Most of these moderators, even if the amazon stuff floats to /top. From what I can tell, this is a relatively new strategy, as some of the older subreddits at the bottom of the table don't appear to have any imgur content. As well, the moderators (and other commenters that reference these subs) will often have comments that blend in with the conversation, while dropping a random /r/subredditlink such as one of those above. A big part of the problem to me is that **even if the mods are hellbanned** --I'm assuming that's why some of those mod's user pages are 404'ing-- the subreddit itself **is still there** and constantly getting name-dropped by other spammy users, ensuring that the affiliate links **still get plenty of hits**.

Judging by the relative ages of some of these subreddits and users, mods, subreddits, and comment/link characteristics and apply some heuristics to come up with a dynamic blacklist for this garbage. I really don't care if the subreddit mentions the Amazon Affiliate program in the sidebar or not. As far as I'm concerned, this sort of thing deserves a blanket ban-hammer.

Looking at their history they likely find some old posts that have done well and repost them.  They collect some amount of 'legitimacy' or  least plausible deniability through that karma.  They likely do this with thousands of accounts automated as much as possible.  Then they use one of those accounts to post some paid content and the other puppets vote up.  That is how they end up with lots of votes with very few comments since comments are harder to fake.  

Sound about right?

I am wondering:  do these voting patterns have a signature compared to organic posts?  Would there be a big upvote spike or an unnaturally steady uptick?  If so

I'd love it if we could get data on who votes up what....then we could probably find the incestuous cells.  As things now stand

This seems like it is probably a hit-piece advertisment by a competitor of Breyers trying to hurt their brand.

I base this off: http://www.statista.com/statistics/190426/top-ice-cream-brands-in-the-united-states/ as you can see Breyers is the largest ice cream brand in the US

It makes perfect sense that competitors would do hit-pieces on reddit if they are already doing promotions for their own products it is quite natural to extend that by doing anti-promotions against competitors.  In fact it is probably easier for a hit-piece to work than for regular advertisement to work

EDIT: saw this comment: [apparently the main flavors are still ice cream](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/137eg2/til_breyers_has_cheapened_up_on_the_ingredients/c71kc3v) so this is clearly a hit-piece.  Who the fuck would link to some wikipedia article to tell other people that an ice cream brand was bad

EDIT 2: The plot thickens.  I checked the [history of the Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Breyers&amp;action=history).  As you can see there has been a rash of edits in the past couple days
