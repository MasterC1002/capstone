I was getting dressed two days ago and I sat there holding my clothes

I felt...better.  For the first time in what might be a decade I felt like things were going to be OK

I let the feeling push me along that afternoon.  It just didn't seem right to be wearing ""such pretty panties"" (they were actually more underwear than panties, getting it smooth and nice as best I could.  I was clumsy about it in some places, one leg has some cuts that still sting a bit, but I was even cheerful about that.  I tried on the contact lenses that my wife had pushed me to try months and months ago, and the inconvenience of putting them in that had so annoyed me - I'd only worn them for a couple of days at first - seemed silly, they made me look good and I could see my eyes.  I put my black metal hard-edged glasses away, hoping I wouldn't have to wear them much again.

My wife noticed her underwear sticking out of my clothes a little bit that evening when I was leaning over to load the washing machine, I told her that I was in a silly mood...she accepted it, but was wondering if I was OK - and she was a little put off at me taking her things without asking.

Yesterday was a Monday.  A dark, my sharp-edged glasses sitting at home, and everything was beautiful.  The slippery sidewalks were like a game, the wintry breeze was invigorating, the black birds against the white snow were poetic...I laughed out loud at nothing in particular while walking to work...and that nagging, whispering negative voice, for the first time since I could remember

All through the day and into the evening I was cheerful.  The computer games and endless Internet scanning that I'd been numbingly retreating into for years didn't attract my interest - I cleaned things up instead, it all just felt right.

That night, and I told her about the existence of the negative voice and how it had gone suddenly, wonderfully silent.  She was happy for me, happy I'd shared it with her, felt sad for me that I'd been facing it so long.  We laughed together about it, I can love how this experiment is affecting me and still know feel that there's a silliness to it.  She's worried about what I'm going through, and still doesn't quite know how to process her man wearing her underwear.

I'm in my second full day in women's underwear.  The happiness is still bubbling along inside, but ""my body"" - to feel healthier and look better.  I look at myself in the mirror and smile...and a different voice, not a whisper but full of life, told me that people love me, that what I do is important, and that I'm worth caring about.

The new voice is a funny mix of encouragement to make things better and happiness with how I am.  I don't have to change, or because of how I'll look to others, it's because it would be fun and make me feel good to do things for myself like that.

I tossed aside my regular deodorant this morning, get away from the boring old mannish cut, try something 'unisex'?

I should look for a therapist

The very first thing I want you to notice is that this is titled *My* Genderqueer Manifesto. It's not *The* Genderqueer Manifesto nor even *A* Genderqueer Manifesto. This one is mine and no one else's. Just like my gender(s). And like my gender, and for it to be completely nonsensical to those outside of my head. Modifications, updates, and other changes may (and likely will) be made without this document ever being updated.

I am genderqueer.

In that big [QUILTBAG](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=QUILTBAG) in which so many of us hang out, my practices are a big fucking question mark, and I love it that way.

**So what's it mean when I say I'm genderqueer?**

* It means sure
* It means sometimes I'm a girl too.  
* It means sometimes I'm neither
* It means I'm rarely a man
* It means that when I fix a car or build something that I don't feel manly or like I'm living up to the gender that is assigned to me. It means I'm really more of a tomboy in those moments.  
* It means that I'm not crossdressing when you see me in skirts and makeup. I'm not wearing women's clothes. I'm wearing *my* clothes
* It means you can refer to me as ""he."" Or ""she."" Or ""ze."" Or any other personal pronoun you prefer. They'll all be right enough
* It means that my beard is pretty and girly

**So what does it not mean when I say that I'm genderqueer?**

* It does not mean that I want to start taking hormones or have my body surgically modified. Some genderqueer people do. That's cool. It's not for me.  
* It does not mean that I'm under any obligation to make my identity apparent to others. Most days I'll be in slacks or jeans and a button down. You'll likely not actively notice anything about my gender.  
* It does not have any bearing on my sexual orientation. I'm mostly attracted to women
* It does not mean that I feel I was born in the wrong body. I fit my body perfectly. I am my body. My gender and my body are inseparable

I notice that my expression of gender varies along with where I am on the extraversion/introversion spectrum. The more extraverted I am

Usually.

But no matter my expression

Even when you can't see my queerness

&gt; Queer is a territory of tension, otherized and oppressed. Queer is the abnormal, the strange, the dangerous. Queer involves our sexuality and our gender, but so much more. It is our desire and fantasies and more still. Queer is the cohesion of everything in conflict with the heterosexual capitalist world. Queer is a total rejection of the regime of the Normal.

&gt; *[Toward The Queerest Insurrection](http://zinelibrary.info/toward-queerest-insurrection-0)* 

I refuse to let myself be managed and policed and limited by narrow,"" ""Yes, sir,"" and ""I don't know what to call you.""

I am a walking, breathing question mark exploding every binary that tries to catch me.

Well, but I hadn't exactly planned it beforehand.  I was in training with a handful of coworkers and my manager, and the topic was political correctness under a ""communicating with respect"" theme.  

Essentially the argument came up over unisex toilets.  Two people in the room commented that they felt confronted and uncomfortable in unisex toilets that had been installed at a local attraction


They commented that so few people fell into that category that it didn't really matter.  I said that more people did than they knew; and that in fact *I* did.  I said straight up that I don't identify as my birth-assigned gender.  I challenged them and asked whether I had the right to have the option of using a bathroom where *I* felt comfortable.


One of the two thought about what I'd said, but allowed that he couldn't hold it against me personally, and since we were in a training that was all about communicating with respect he couldn't really say any more (thankfully).


Through all this, I was still worried about what he would think on a personal level.

Immediately after the discussion concluded, new workplace and all), but he's always said he values diversity very highly and is something of a champion for a few minority groups' recognition and rights in our business.


After the training concluded, for my own sake as much as anyone else's!


Best.  Manager.  EVER.  I'm not even out to my family; how many people can say that their workplace is their Safe Place?

The thing is, friends, and strangers feel the need to reinforce and coerce my masculinity to keep me in line. I think before I would just go along with what people said and act like they wanted. I feel more rebellious now, but I'm still insecure and depressed about it. I think it has a little to do with recently discovering I'm 'bicurious.' I don't really know what label to use - I feel like there's more to it than that - but I don't want to go on a big tangent. The point is, it was like taking the red pill, so to speak. Before I went through life being a straight guy, and now I'm finding out I'm not as straight as I thought, as other people would like me to be. So even though I haven't come out or anything

I wonder if maybe I acted more obviously effeminate or androgynous, but I'm guessing they perceive me as mainly straight or dudely so they find it jarring when I do something inconsistent with that image.

I cried because I wish I could go outside and interact with other humans without being sexualized and expected to look or act a certain way based on my femaleness. I cried because I hate how I am treated a certain way just because of my genetics. I cried because no one could see the beauty that I saw in myself as a naked human being

I have to constantly remind myself

I am a human that just happens to be female. I am not defined by my sex. My sex does not define my role in life, and I must live my life as such. 

You are all beautiful as well. Regardless of your identity, dysphoria, acceptance, or expression, you are all beautiful human beings, capable of many wonderful things, and you all deserve to be happy with yourselves and with your lives.

Clothing is a strong form of self-expression. As a MAAB

Every male has a (mostly black/gray/brown/blue) T-shirt and denim pants on and that's all. There are a very few designs to choose from, rainbow-striped long socks, or loosy sheer dress on a warm day. But wearing any of these things draws way too much attention from the surrounding (and I still have some social anxiety about that).

I don't want to dress as a woman. I want that these forms of cloting not to be considered female-only. I want the same freedom for men what every woman have. (And the same rights for the woman

It seems to me

I never felt being masculine the way the society showed me. I like my own male body

Luckily, partly came out to even closer friends of mine. I enjoy the support of ~~my~~ an amazing girlfriend, who understands and supports me. I began to feel, what looks good (or at least: okay) on me.

It was a great feeling.

I've never felt so comfortable or had so much fun at a party.  I'm usually totally awkward in big social situations

Of course

With every new step I take in feeling more and more like a woman I am reminded that my body is not where I want it to be and feeling sad for how much of my life I feel like I've missed out on because I've spent so long struggling with this subconciously.  But

Good Ol' Riker.  Always falling in love with everyone.  The episode does an alright job, if not obvious, commentary.

A quote from the episode:
""Soren: I am female. I was born that way. I have had those feelings, and what all of those who are like me need, is your understanding. And your compassion. We have not injured you in any way. And yet we are scorned and attacked. And all because we are different. What we do is no different from what you do. We talk, and laugh. We complain about work. And we wonder about growing old. We talk about our families, and we worry about the future. And we cry with each other when things seem hopeless. All of the loving things that you do with each other, that is what we do. And for that, we are called misfits, and criminals. What right do you have to punish us? What right do you have to change us? What makes you think you can dictate how people love each other?

So I went to get fast food before and I could tell the girl helping me wasn't sure what to think. I tried not to say much cuz my voice isn't very manly either.

Once at target I grabbed some pants and shirts and went towards the fitting rooms hoping no employees were out front
Anyway I tried on things like 5 times and decided on two jeans and a flanel. Now mind you I wasn't in guy mode but I was dressed so just for convenience's sake because I had time to shop tonight and I've been anxious to get clothes.

When I get the the checkout there's a women with two little girls in line in front of me. I set the clothes down and the girls immediately start telling me all about the toys they just got. The mom is flustered finding her money or something but she comes back and her daughter says something about ""I'm telling that guy about my toys"" and the mom says ""you mean that person"" and she starts having this long conversation with me about she doesn't want them to be rude and all that and she was very nice. Obviously I was in girl mode and not really passing any way so I don't blame her for realizing I'm a girl, like the mom needs to explain stuff like that, and I just kinda wanted to get out of there at this point. Anyway it was interesting and now I have cool pants, maybe I'll be able to wear them out sometime soon.

My friends have always joked about how they expected me to be gay. Except replace friends with fucking everyone and replace joke with constant verbal and physical harassment throughout the entity of my childhood. You see

Being forced into that box had me CONSTANTLY doubting my sexuality. Gods forbid I prove any of those abusive bastards right and be attracted to a boy, I'd probably hop on one, but I have a hard enough time not being bored to death or reviled by my own parts. Again, a story for another day, but HEY I'M TRYING TO BUILD A FRAMEWORK HERE, BE PATIENT, okay?

*cough* So, I came to find out, wasn't because I was ""jealous"" or ""wanted what I couldn't have"" or ""programmed"" by my parents. I've genuinely been attracted to lesbians, like, full throttle ""OMG I WANT TO GET TO KNOW HER AND SNUGGLE"" kind of attraction. For years I've fought with that until a kind, queer-minded individual told me ""No, seriously. It's okay. You're a lesbian with a penis.""

It blew my mind. Homosexuality is A sexual orientation in a myriad. I might be physically a male

Then, either. I've always felt somewhere in the middle. ""Queer but not gay is."" how I used to say it (especially every time a boy wanted in my pants). Genderqueer not only SOUNDS better, but it feels RIGHT. 

The few that understood more or less reacted: ""Duh."" The few that didn't asked me to enlighten them. Some of my friends (gay/bi/straight) decided that I was just looking for attention and ""The whole genderqueer thing is just a fad."" I was crushed

My mom

""So

No, mom identifies as bi. She was with a woman for the first 23ish years of my life. I've only known her as a lesbian. When I was a kid, we went to pride fest every year. Eventually, tho, their participation in the LGBT community stopped. So, apart from having almost zero support for being ""gay by proxy"" and all of the discrimination that brought, my mom is also VERY behind the times on the minutia of sexuality and gender identity. I tried to explain to her more or less everything I've described above, I just don't understand.""

We haven't talked about it since.

See

So

Well, I'm trying to find ME. Since mom seems to see things so black and white, I feel like it's going to be a hard sell and I might not get the love and support I was expecting. It's one thing to tell your mom you're gender non-conformist, it's another thing entirely to have to explain starting HRT without the intent of going ""tranny"".

My biggest fear is having to come out AGAIN. To everyone. Especially my partner who is biologically female, but everything else is... scary. I've always been afraid to identify as a lesbian because I was afraid that the ""real"" lesbian community wouldn't take me seriously. I've felt for a long time like I'm just crazy, or have no place in the world, but it seems I might not be as alone or batshit as I thought I was.

As open minded

The first thing I did was affirm him that we love him because he is ours, kind, intelligent and so much more. His gender identity, his sexual orientation are non-issues for us. He's been a part of many conversations in our home where we have expressed our feelings about this topic. People are people. Sexuality is complicated. We understand that...even if both of us are cisgender and hetero. Intellectually, and emotionally, we understand that for many, many people it's just not this simple. 

He wants to take the summer to experiment a bit. Grow out his hair etc. Which we are totally okay with. Even if we don't know how to guide him...how to support him.

I've been a lurker on reddit for months. Finally registered recently. And this is one of my only posts. Having read through this sub all day today...I feel safe asking for your advice and perspective. 

I would love to hear your experiences coming out to your parents...what they did right

I want to do right by my child. Several months back, accepted, cherished, and safe to be exactly who they are.' 

Fast forward a few months...and here I am. So far, dress that might fit him...if he wanted to try it out. His response was 'Cool. I might do that.' 

How can I help him figure this out? How can I support him? Where can I take him dressed as a girl

And how the hell do I find the strength to not fucking care what people think about my child? How do I let it go when someone judges him a freak? When someone I consider a friend or loved one says something asinine? How in the world do I handle that? I know I can be strong and walk away...but I don't ever want him to know that it hurts me when people hurt him. He's sensitive enough that he might revert to not exploring

Hi!

My name is Jaybird and I am genderqueer.  Gender is really interesting to me and my partner and I enjoy making a social experiment out of it.  When we decided to have a baby

	I started telling my friends, not really knowing what it meant.  I don’t think I did either. 
There’s a venue in a not-so-safe part of town that my friends and I frequent.  Once, and I had to pop it back into place.  I didn’t know what had happened until I saw S.’s girlfriend, Co.,  with tears streaming down her face.  C., with a bit of blood on his cheek, told me that we had to leave, immediately.  We snuck back to his car and sped out of that neighborhood.  Everyone was frightened, and towards the hospital, and it seemed that they had only barely gotten away.  
	As we approach our own neighborhood, and I needed some painkillers and rest.  I told him that he needed the hospital more, and that my knee could wait a few hours.  He insisted that he would be fine, and I was driven home first.  
	After that incident, and get stronger.  He asked me if I could sew thin metal sheets to the inside of his leather jacket, for armor.  He needed to prove himself like a child who had fallen off of their first bike.  He had to prove that he was a man, not a failure.  
	S., who used to hand me all of his valuables and run towards a fight with a lighter in his fist, shrink away from confrontation for the first time in my memory.  He said that he knew he had been wrong before- being able to punch someone says nothing about your real strength, and no petty argument was worth paying for with your health or life. Three weeks later, he and his girlfriend went back to the venue, with no problems.  
	Months ago, but having a hard time choking the words out.  My friend had died a few days earlier, and I was taking it hard.  I had tried to see S. before that night, but he had been busy.   As I told him, he drove silently, dragging on a cigarette and looking straight ahead.  He asked me why I had waited to tell him if it had been bothering me for so long.  I brushed it off, joking that he had had better things to do, the distress
S. told me about the last time he had cried since childhood.  It was a couple years ago, and no way is the wrong way.  That it was okay to be sad about something, and it was okay to cry. 

A few nights ago, I had sent him an article on masculinity, and how men are pressured to disguise their emotions. 
 I should preface this by saying that Nate has lots of feelings. On average, just talking, a switch flipped, and out came the tears.  That particular night, he started disparaging himself, saying “Look at me.  Fuckin’ cry baby.” I smiled, and wiped his cheek.  “Well, anyways.  Gender roles
While discussing the article, no really, it didn’t.  He said that being manly, in his mind, was being in control of your emotions, and being responsible- a leader.  It seems to me that he just described an adult, not a man,  a song came up on the mixed CD I had made him almost half a year ago.  It was “Boys Don’t Cry”;  I turned it up
	Today,  “I feel like staying in, drinking a bottle of wine, and crying all night.  I haven’t had a good night like that in a while.”  We laughed, and I said “I don’t think I’ve ever seen you cry.”  He told me, once again, that he hadn’t in a very long time.  But, “I don’t really feel the need to weep.  It doesn’t change anything or make me feel any better.”  I paused for a minute

I'm 21 years old.

When I was about seven or eight

This wasn't the first time this happened.  

One of my earliest memories is playing with my mom's wedding bouquet and pretending to be the bride at the wedding.  

And when I played with a cousin of mine, wanted to be a princess.  
I had these adventure games with a friend
I made my mom buy me a barbie when I was six.  

But what I wanted more than anything, I always played a girl if I could. I loved it when NPC would call me ""she"" or ""miss"" or ""milady"".  
I never liked conflict

I started crossdressing when I was fourteen or so. It started out just with bras and panties

I loved it.

I always wanted to be a girl. But I always found myself attracted to girls. I mean, I only want to do boys.  
I was always really submissive in my dreams as a lady.  
In my imagination, I would be a good girl.  
I've been attracted to men, I like girls. But not really in a sexual way that I like guys. I feel, however, that a guy could ask me out, and I would say yes even if I didn't think too much of him, so long as I thought he'd be a decent man.  

When I imagine myself with a man

My interests are a little boyish. I like sports and video games and computer stuff

I do my best to be androgynous in most of the things I do. I hate having to identify myself as a guy. I wish I could at least have no gender. Maybe that would feel fair.  
  
I keep day dreaming of being 'his' girlfriend.  

But I want to be a girl.  

I just ordered a set of bras and a wig off of ebay.  
I still live with my parents
I'm nervous about these desires.  
Am I too late to become a girl?
Should I? I mean
I mean... I'm not horribly depressed or anything. I'm not overtly dissatisfied with my life.  
I fear hurting my parents and the people who know me.

That said, with others calling me a girl, dressing feminine, etc. But really, I don't identify with the concept of ""being a woman"" because, in my mind, I'm just a *person*; the core of what I am is in my brain, but that's because that's what suits me aesthetically, I'd probably be fine calling myself a dude and dressing masculine and enjoy doing that,' and just see them as.. well

If I could switch gender at will, and the other body's handy for others; I guess I just like the idea of experimenting with different perspectives. I don't feel attached to any one particular way of being.

Does anyone else feel like this? What is this? Is this what it is to be agender? Or am I bigender? Or androgynous? Do I have some kind of dissociation thing going on? Or am I just a girl? Is this how most (cis) people feel? Like a brain controlling some kind of biomecha? 

..Sounds a little weird now that I've written it down. I don't normally really think about it.

EDIT: And while I'm at it, we all had the same body, voice, and expressed body language (but the same internal gender/memories/etc.)? Sometimes I think people get so distracted by the exterior and attach themselves to it, when if you really listen to the message, each gender is basically saying and/or feeling the same thing, and it's the fact that we're so easily put off by external perception we end up with some pretty bizarre assumptions about what gender is.

After a long pause, I added that I wasn't exactly the most masculine guy in the world anyway, and that was more at home taking care of kids, baking things, the sort of roles that society deems as stereotypically feminine.

So that brings me back to where I am now.  I'm not sure that I technically qualify as genderqueer.

I'm curious if the feeling is different in a space like this. **My question:** for feminine-expressing MAABs, what has your experience been with dating people who are attracted to your being genderqueer? Is it validating? Is it frustrating if their ideal partner and your ideal expression don't quite match, and they try to change you? I'm interested in anything you have to say.

tl;dr version:

*Recently came to accept that I am genderqueer. I am bio-male but am currently in a female phase

*just bought my first set of women's clothes which feel amazing

*struggling with trying to leave the house because I'm too scared to leave the house in drag but I feel like I'm not myself without them.

*Don't have a lot of people I can talk to about this stuff so I thought I'd introduce myself.

I'm biologically male but throughout my life I've never quite fit in anywhere with respect to gender. I have a number of masculine traits and characteristics but also a strong set of feminine traits. They've always shifted around periodically. I've always had a hard time socially too. I (wanted) to fit in with both boys and girls. Whenever I'd play 'house' I always wanted to be the mommy. My entire life I've had much stronger friendships with girls than with guys. I often consider myself ""one of the girls.""

Throughout my life I'd have periods where I directly questioned my gender (had a brief period at 15 when I thought I might be trans) and sexuality

Actually

Maybe a week later I started to think about my gender a lot more. For the last 1-2 weeks all day every day I keep thinking things like ""I wish I were a woman"" or simply ""I am a woman."" and other things of the sort. When watching porn I started to identify more and more with the female instead of the male actors. I've had moments before and there are have plenty of times when I was more effeminate than others

A couple days ago I was in therapy when it finally dawned on me that I am not a man that has feminine traits

I went out dancing with a guy on Friday and for the first time in my life I got to dance how I wanted to. I got to dance in a way that gave me the stylistic freedom to more genuinely express myself and that made me feel sexy. I got to be a girl. When I was out on the floor I was just so... elated. It was this deep

I hate dancing as a guy. Partly because I want to be girly and roll my hips but mostly because I'm so scared of how people will treat me. On an individual level, I'm scared that people won't understand and they'll be scared of me. Being pansexual, I have to even worry about my reputation. I constantly fight against my tendency towards femininity because if I want to sleep with a woman then I have to be the kind of person they'd be attracted to (ie. mostly likely I'd need to present as male/masculine).

So, and bought some clothes. For days when I've thought about going I was so scared but once I made up my mind to go there was just some powerful spiritual energy carrying me through. It was just so clear that this is what I needed that nothing else mattered.

As I was getting my makeup done and I as I started trying on clothes, but I don't want to leave because it means I'll have to leave myself behind. I want to wear my new clothes out but I'm scared. It's a weird tension between wanting to be seen in these clothes but also not wanting to be seen.

It just makes me so sad that I (or anyone else) should have to go through this much angst over a fundamental part of my personality that doesn't hurt anyone. It makes me sad that I feel like I have to choose between being happy and being accepted.

I have a hard time telling people. A couple people have responded positively, I don't know think I'll ever tell my parents. hey don't disapprove of being queer in general, but I don't think they'd understand what my experience is or really believe that it's not just a phase or whatever.

Anyway

&gt; People were inquisitive

If you're here

Yes, as a result of my sudden preference for my ""more masculine"" name.

Just let me set straight now that I'm not transsexual, however, is Genderqueer. This is a completely different kind of beast to transsexualism. Where a transsexual is someone who's gender identity is opposite to their physical sex, causing a dysphoria, Genderqueer is an umbrella term that encompasses those who's gender sits outside the commonly accepted binary.

What does that all mean? I like to walk a line that's in between what people choose to define as male or female, just I'm choosing to live more closely to the genetic quirks I feel have helped define me as a person. It's not something I'm trying to hide, and I don't want to be treated any differently for it, especially since it's taken so long for me to redefine myself as something I can be proud of.

So I guess what I'm saying is, just a happier individual looking to be proud of what she is. What I am is a genetically quirky genderqueer, not looking to make excuses for the things that make me happy. If people want to ask questions you can do so here, or on facebook, or email me at [POPULAR EMAIL SERVICE]. Honestly ask me anything, because I'm the kind of person who thinks that curiosity should be rewarded. If I can help you to better understand things, then it's a good outcome for both of us.

I guess I should make it my new years resolution to be more open about all of this. Unfortunately the misinformation can be quite damaging

I hope 2010 finds you as well as it has me.

Now I'm just trying to come to terms if this is more of a gender thing or if it's just my imagination. See I believe that some men have repressed feminine traits and the only way they feel comfortable letting them out is to crossdress or identify with being more female

So right now I feel like a girl, which just caused a lot of trouble. So I feel like a lot of it is just repressed feelings coming to the surface and right now it's overpowering. I have a feeling it's going to normalize or shift. Or maybe it won't and this is really my true self. 

But like I said this could have nothing to do with gender. It's possible I confused masculine for cold, friendly, and socialble. So there was a split in my personality almost. A lot of these changes are more internal, with a slight desire to crossdress and see myself as female. 

Right now I feel like I get it

I'm FAAB, after learning about real transgender people on the internet, stuff has come flooding back. I've always been fascinated by transgender people, and where is my beard and what are *these*? 

I actually remember the *moment* I realized I was going to grow boobs. My (male

Horror. In my mind: ""Oh. My. God. I'm going to grow *boobs*. I mean--of course I am, please no. I don't want to. I can't. This isn't right. Am I going to have to call them breasts, too? Of course I will. And I'll have to be a *mom*. Please, God, anybody, no.""

I hate my body. Why am I so narrow and dainty? Why is my voice like this? This isn't what it's like in my head. My voice surprises me when I speak out loud. And where the heck is my beard? Aren't I supposed to be shaving by now? I want to shave. (Puberty was horrible. All the wrong things. Why did those people get to have the right things

And of course the sexual stuff: I can't bear to imagine being the ""woman"" in these situations, is unimaginable relief, like wiggling out of a rope that has been cutting off circulation to my body for years. 

But I don't just want to be a *man*. I've cosied up to the idea of being a lesbian, and people like me (gay people, trans people, people who haven't had the standard straight, cisgender experience of sexuality) see me and recognize me. I know (if I recognize them) what it feels like, in part, to be them, while I might not lose being in the queer community

I don't need to be read as a man, cannot be my body. (But this is what everybody sees when they look at me.) Ugh. 

I mean, and other sex-related prejudices--but those things aren't about me being male or female in itself but about society's hangups. I could do without those. Without those, I might not not mind being read as female. However, I might not mind being read as male--might like being read as male--if I could also be read as gay or queer. (Also, how boring would it be to appear to the world to be a straight guy? That thought has me reeling. Just me leaving what I'm used to, though.)

Finding you people (not just the genderqueer people

So, and I do like the queer community. But I'm wondering if I'm basing my genderqueer identity not on my *gender* but on my desire to be more male than I am (from genuine instinct and dysphoria) minus my fear of actually transitioning, stemming from my reluctance to pull myself out of the queer community (which is less gender and more just lifestyle). I wonder if I should just be identifying as trans (like, binary trans). I don't know.

So I'm biologically male and have been wildly dissatisfied with it since I entered high school. There were signs of it all down the line; I've always been more interested in technology, I was railroaded into being a good, straight, cis-gendered, God-fearing white Christian boy. Well, until I wasn't.

At 15, by extension), I just decided to write it off as a shameful bit of curiosity and hope she never brought it up again. ""At least I'm still straight, right? God shouldn't hold this against me if I repent.""

Finding out I was at least bi came in a way I wasn't expecting. I was 17, the gender-bending deuteragonist of Ocarina of Time, crossed my mind. Before long, I realized I was having my first gay sexual fantasy--and I liked it. Since I was still very much a True Believer (I'm talkin' bout young-earth creationist and denominational Christians are going to Hell for polluting the Gospel), I descended into a shame spiral that led me to believe, for about four years, that I could literally die at any moment by some tragedy or the Second Coming

At 19, which caused me a great deal of stress and emotional pain--to say nothing of how my faith began to erode as I witnessed the fear, loathing, and hypocrisy among the ranks there.

A little over a year later (20-21), got into my first serious (read: abusive) relationship with a girl (who manipulated me out of my virginity), and finally quit going to church for good. I actually worked up the courage to tell my evil ex that I was bisexual, wanted to try pegging--in other words, everything I was aware of at the time. She took it well, but she couldn't resist the occasional disparaging remark about ""One day you're gonna leave me for the personal trainer,"" which I resented.

After almost two years together (22-23), with limited social skills and few friends, and I decided to throw myself at the craigslist meat grinder--which had the unintended consequences of making me feel like a cheap, worthless whore. Those awful two-night stands made me realize I really was kind of a girl when it came to sex--for better (fantastic lover) and for worse (getting attached).

24 was a rollercoaster. I dated a straight girl who wanted me to be more masculine, moved to yet another town, fell into depression and started drinking a big bottle of cheap wine every night. I finally started getting professional help for everything that was going on at this point in my life, and it was an immense help.

25 was a kick in my love life's teeth. I have a lesbian soul sister whose newly-minted ex threw herself at me to make her jealous, I started to feel the creep-up of old age and regret. After the second one, I had a really bad flashback to the abusive relationship and once again threw myself up on CL--this time, with a guy. It was, as I joke, the most disappointing four inches and four minutes of my entire life. I didn't doubt I was bisexual under more ideal circumstances--but this wasn't it. On a positive note, I found out I was really attracted to trans girls

26 was going great for a really long time. I came out as queer/questioning/fuckifino to my dad and stepmom, and was learning about other permutations within the QUILTBAG spectrum that seemed to fit better than any explanation I had going at the time. And it was on that high note that I started dating my most recent ex, who was smart, kinky, and loved the fact that I was her little girlfriend or something like that (at least at the outset). Although she gave me a lot of room to explore who I was, the relationship itself was doomed. I finally pulled the plug at the end of May, after seven and a half months.

During that time up to basically now
(1) The aforementioned relationship
(2) One of my best friends, and was firing off this seven-course meal of copypasta about the dread Homosexual Agenda. I composed a long, thought-out reply to it, which he promptly deleted from his Facebook wall. Our other best friend, the aforementioned roommate of mine, asked him why he was calling people out for repressing his freedom of speech while doing the same to others, and we both got defriended.
(3) I'm staying with my folks between leases right now, but he told me ""You're almost 28 and I'm cleaning up after you. Do your part and quit being such a God damn girl about it,"" which made me angry enough to involuntarily react--slamming my hands down on the sink, making an awful racket because of the fork I was holding. For all the years I had to put up with my asshole stepdad telling me to ""man up"" or ""be a man,"" and considering my apple didn't roll far from his tree, the old man's sudden burst of anger and insensitivity sent me reeling. On the other hand, I'm now much more conscious of using any kind of bigoted slur

I have a question concerning gender identity.

I have read in several places, and I know that this is very important to many people, but I’m confused about it.

I just can’t find that in myself. To me, I do not conform all too well to how men are traditionally “supposed” to be. So I certainly have an opinion on being a man based on that. But as I understand it, for most people, that is not all. They know that, for example, they are a man, even if they don’t agree with the traditional male gender role

Saying “I am a man” feels weird to me. “I am a woman” feels even weirder, but if I understand correctly that’s not really the criterion, either. Can you explain to me how, apart from external social attitudes, one can feel like a specific gender?

Three and a half years ago I started medically transitioning. My body identity had always been primarily female, and didn't mind that I wasn't a ""hardline"" trans woman, or that I dressed like a tomboy who didn't give a fuck. However, I was lost, and didn't know anything about anything, so she recommended me to a couple of trans groups. From there, I fell into a crowd of hardline trans women.

Big mistake.

At first they accepted me, though, the questions started coming out and they started asking me when I was going to get the surgery, why I wasn't dressing more femininely or wearing makeup, and so on. They warned me that my doctor may even strip my HRT away from me if I didn't ""smarten up"" and start being hardline right then and there. They told me being ""genderqueer"" is just what those 18 year old first-year college students taking Women's Studies do, and that it's just a fad/trend for them, and they'll NEVER understand what being a REAL transperson was. Hell,"" because ""trans"" is a bad word that should be erased. 

They were extremely catty, they betrayed me and hung me out to dry, but not before instilling a metric ton of internalized transphobia and queerphobia. For a while I was miserable. I wanted to present however I wanted, but I was TERRIFIED of my doctor revoking my HRT, or never qualifying for SRS since dressing like a tomboy wouldn't be considered ""full time,"" even though SRS was, originally, I was feeling a lot of anxieties that weren't even mine. 

At Burning Man 2011, some people came up to them and said their bravery was inspiring, knowing full well how society at large treats gender-variant people. Eventually, I went topless there, and stopped giving a fuck myself, and two and half years of emotional conditioning just kinda unravelled all at once.

So, so fuck it. Is it even a trend anymore when it lasts a lifetime? I'm going to present however I like, dye my hair, not wear makeup, and use whatever pitch of voice feels comfortable for me at the time. I have more important things to do than constantly re-evaluate my gender presentation.

I have a boyfriend who I met online; who knows about my genderqueer status and loves me for who I am. I know he cares deeply for me

* Most days I am okay with my appearance but other days I am not. My boyfriend and I went to the grocery store recently - I was dressed in a casual sundress and platform sandals - we temporarily separated to tackle the grocery list. I headed down an isle and passed a little boy who I noticed out of the corner of my eye staring at me. I later met up with my boyfriend and I heard the little boy - who was behind me - reach his mother and say ""That's a man."" As I went down another aisle, I went to the RedBox DVD rental kiosk and searched for a movie. A black lady and her daughter were behind me and the daughter (about 4 years old) proclaimed loudly, ""Mommy, why is that Man wearing a Dress?"" The woman appropriately told her daughter to be quiet and I went about my way. As my boyfriend and I headed to the car the same mother and daughter duo headed out as well. Apparently we had parked near one another, as I helped put groceries into the car I noticed the mother watching me carefully as she helped her child into the car. I glanced over at her and she stiffened. Her face was a combination of mortification, embarrassment, and fear. I had done nothing to her and I felt that my appearance alone had terrorized her. I was upset on the way home but I couldn't bear to answer my boyfriend's questions as to why, ""People are jerks.""

*I felt beautiful in the outfit that I wore to the grocery store but the three separate incidents made me feel awful. It's times like those that make me want to go speak to a plastic surgeon. I would rather look like an ugly woman than a man wearing a dress. I'm considering talking to a surgeon about FFS (facial feminization surgery).*

I had always known I was a little bi-curious, she didn't hesitate to ask me out. Our first date was incredibly intimate; we instantly connected on a level that surpassed anything I had experienced before.

By far the most memorable moment of the night occurred half-way through dinner

We've been together for seven months now. I came out to my family as gay for her (even though I'm pan... they are fairly black and white). My daughter calls her Myma (Mee-mah, and about the LGBTQI community in general.

The one thing I value most about our relationship is our communication. We trust each other so deeply

It hurts. It's the feeling of being stifled. Of wanting to peel your flesh off and step out as your chosen sex. It's constant depression and anxiety. In some it's feeling suicidal because they feel mismatched. It's desperately wanting to ""pass"" as your current gender

Another good way to describe dysphoria is the sensation of feeling like you're wearing too many layers. You've got socks on, you just feel uncomfortable and suffocated and you want to take some of the clothes off. Now imagine you can't, or if you do, the clothes you put on instead are physically uncomfortable, but on such a smaller degree that you put up with it, or they look odd on you because they weren't made for your body shape - but you feel at least marginally better.",,,genderqueer-pan,

I've been getting a huge boost lately from exploring outside the gender box I and everyone else assumed for me since birth based on what was between my legs.  There didn't seem to much of a downside to it

Last night I was at a meeting in an old mansion, and realized that the whole entry area was crazy with mirrors - every wall, not floor to ceiling but randomly placed everywhere you turned.  With every turn away from a mirror I turned right into another one, and it got worse and worse, the reflection just seemed to get more grotesque with each image.  I finally found a spot away from the reflections and stood there until I could leave, feeling very freaked out.

All that evening at home I found myself turning my eyes away from mirrors.  When I woke up and had to put in my contact lenses I was OK with my eye right against my reflection

Sudden, and there's this howling nastiness from the emotional pit I recently dragged myself out of that's calling to me and telling me that I've waited far too long and nothing I do will change it enough to matter.

**~ Back Story ~**

I was always having trouble identifying who I was as a person. I have had issues with my identity since I was 14 and began high school and possibly even before then as well when I was 11 (that's when the thoughts started to appear). I had always worn boy's clothes up until I was 14 (my parents were awesome and had no issues buying them for me). I had been made fun of a lot when I had turned 13

Ever since the beginning of high school, and I had really enjoyed it, but was so confused. I had been called a lesbian throughout my entire high school career (even though I had a boyfriend for the first half of it), it was just a mess. 

Now



**~ Getting to the Point ~**

I just had some questions as to how to, but now that I feel comfortable with myself, I wanted to figure out ways in order to be more masculine since I have been hindering myself on the days that I do and it really sucks. I have longer, past-the-shoulders blonde hair (that I absolutely LOVE and would hate cutting) but I have seen suggestions like putting it under a hat or something to that effect. I rarely wear make up as it is. In terms of men's clothing, I would just wear shirts and then women's pants since I couldn't fit in the men's pants because I am too skinny.

My wife and I (m) are both a bit alternative, Burners, etc.  Just stating that to give a brief background, however we are also both mature, stable, responsible adults, we own our own home, I am an artist and a stay at home parent.  So we recently had our first and only kid (getting a vasectomy so it's for sure)

My wife knows about my CD and is very supportive, etc.   I don't do CD 24/7, I consider myself gender queer and not trans, thus I don't want to be a woman or even look like a woman all the time, I am a person that likes having fun with his look, usually more on the effeminate, gay boy look or of course full CD or sissy look.  If anything, girly boy look.

We both want to raise our child to be free thinking, gender stereotypes and clothing.  So if he wants to wear all blue and only overalls and jeans that is fine but if he wants to wear pink tutus and fairy wings with a tiara that is fine too, I won't push him either way or put my CD issues or beliefs on him, I just want him to know that he can dress and look however he wants and his parents will defend and support him in his choices.  Just as he can play rugby or dance ballet, it is up to him.

Now, accessorize, wear jewelry and have girly or gay boy fashion sense, just so I can appear to be a""normal"" parent and so he won't be teased that his dad is a fag or whatever.  I hope that I can bring him up as an artist/costumer/burner/sculptor/etc, who will appreciate deviation from the norm and defend his dad's eccentricity and life choices.  In short, like most all parents, I hope to instill in him with what I see as the right values and morals.

Anyhow, assuming I don't decide to give up CD when around him and keep it to just private outings and parties, then he is going to see dad dressed up.  Thus I would love to know how other parents handle or plan to handle this situation.  How do you or did you intend to explain it, how did your child react, etc.  

Btw, as to me it makes a difference in respect to this situation, that I don't usually do the full CD with a wig and make up.  I do enjoy those things, but keep them more for parties.  My view on clothing actually is that all clothing is gender neutral and anyone should be able to wear anything they want.  Thus, when hanging around the house, I might slip into a tshirt and sweat pants or a skirt with leggings and a tshirt or jeans and a blouse, or jeans and a tshirt with pink panties underneath or any combination of anything.  Personally this is what I want my child to become used to and cool with

Right now, we grow a little more every day and the workload isn't very heavy, so I figure I'll open applications for another mod when we hit a milestone like 1000 readers. I am, of course, open to feedback on this idea.

Rules! Yes, hurtful comments. Even so, I'm tempted to message them and strive to *teach* rather than to dismiss. More to the point, however, about rules. What should our rules be? These are rules that would cover everyone, so as readers you would be able to call me on it if I should happen to goof up somewhere, too. Personally, just in case, but we're got an awesome community here

Also, and I've been working on how to figure out image-based flair for a little while. I do very much like [/r/ainbow](/r/ainbow)'s flag flair; it seems very sensible and professional. To be honest, though, I'm not exactly a fan of the genderqueer flag; I'll rally beneath it, but I just don't like the lavender and green combination. I need to ask the mods of [/r/ainbow](/r/ainbow) how they got image-based flair up and running... and also, [/r/mylittlepony](/r/mylittlepony) had a utility running that would allow users to assign their own, custom flair at one point. All you needed was a tiny image to upload... I think that would be useful, even though it would mean more work for me. Personally

In summation:

1. Rules and guidelines: Let's work out some sensible rules together.

Around February of this year, ""Fuck it, Imma do what I want.""  I'm a biological male, 6'6"" and with a very masculine form, but I decided to start openly wearing makeup, nail polish and whatever clothes I wanted to.  For a solid three months I had a terrific experience expanding my own horizons and getting comfortable in my own skin and in my own ambiguous gender identity.  I learned in those months that there are such things as comfort, acceptance and love for people like us.  There is peace and community and normalcy, when you just decide to do it and let yourself be yourself.

It culminated in going to my spring formal in a dress and patterned stockings.  All of my friends were supportive, and on the whole the night was glorious.  A week later I wore makeup and nail polish at graduation, and later when I went out to dinner I kept the makeup and nail polish and wore capris with the same patterned stockings I wore to formal.  It felt great.  Here I was, out in public, looking genuinely good in a gender-ambiguous way, comfortable with myself.

(by the way, where I attended, was a loving, accepting community.  Somewhat surprising for its conservative theological base, but worth stating and commending here)

Anyway, so I can't move out onto my own yet.

I've tried even wearing makeup around them, but it seems like I can't do anything outside of accepted gender binary without her reminding me that my gender-ambiguous behavior is harmful to my employment prospects and my lifelong success potential.  I want to say that she's wrong, but living in Mississippi she's probably right.

I feel like I've gone from living life in an open field to living in a small room.  I already have the shock that I'm not in college anymore (I'm working on getting into ""normal"" grad school to become a teacher now) and on top of that I have to find a way to deal with the fact that I can't dress myself and present myself how I want to if I'm to expect any measure of normal employment and fulfillment

I know how to ""just do it""

I don't know how to stare down the person who loves me the most and tell her that she's wrong when I know she isn't.

I don't know how to stare down the harsh realities of employment in the deep south and still manage to be myself.

Staying in the closet, but at the same time I feel like the expression I crave is similarly no longer a viable option for pursuing the path of life that I want.

I'm a male and for the past few days I've been wearing my wife's underwear.  It's made me feel radically better about myself and my life, make it easier for her.

I let my wife sleep in - she'd had a rough night

I went back in the bedroom to get dressed, satiny, pretty underthings.  Then I looked at my top drawer in front of me, filled with fresh clean menswear like I'd been wearing, except this week, every day of my life for decades.  I picked up a pair of men's underwear, put it down again.  I looked over at my sleeping, probably a little freaked-out-at-me wife.

I didn't feel right taking her things without asking, and you really should find out if you *want* to do this or if you *need* to.'

I pulled on a pair of men's briefs, you're just getting yourself worked up.'  I stood there, leaning on my dresser, taking deep breaths...then I pulled myself out of the room, like I was grabbing each muscle of my legs with a puppet string.

I made it two steps out the bedroom door before my knees went out from under me.  I was at the top of the stairs

The voice came up again, pushing me forward.

I pulled myself up the wall and held on

That negative voice, told me that no one would care if I died, the voice that had gone miraculously silent the day I slipped on a pair of women's underwear...it had always called me 'you'.  *You* made mistakes, *you* wouldn't be missed, *you* could just step in front of that truck and it would be over.  The positive voice, the one that only started up yesterday, it always said ""I"" and ""Me"".  ""I"" am doing work that is important.  People love *me*.  *I* am going to be OK.

I grabbed yesterday's 'pretty panties' off the top of the laundry hamper in front of me - they were still nice enough, buried the men's underwear in the bottom of a downstairs laundry bin.

I tried to eat some breakfast, I didn't want to scare her.

As I walked to work I was apprehensive at first, and I'm still a bit unnerved from the experience.

I'm hoping for some useful recommendations from the local physician I know of

I just wanted to ask you all what you thought.  I feel pretty much like I'm both, I always feel a little bummed that I don't have real breasts or a vagina, but I also always love my penis.

Is there a different term than bigender that I should look into?  I know that I'm just who I am at the end of the day, but I enjoy the community of knowing the ""right"" label.

Additionally, moody and can't concentrate on anything (I was like this for most of my teenage years before they did a blood test) but I still have these urges to cross dress.

I've always wondered how I'd change if I stopped this TRT completely and go on female hormones but I do like my male body

I'm a genderqueer person who was assigned female at birth.  About a week ago I had my second visit to Planned Parenthood to renew my birth control prescription.  We'll come to that later.  

The first visit happened a few months ago, the doctor needed to ask me plenty of questions, and I had to give lots of answers.  Some of those were about my sex life, my gender, the medications I'm already on...everything went smoothly.  The doctor who had me was curious about my genderqueer identity, so we ended up having a long discussion on what exactly that meant for me and how I came to recognize and embrace my gender identity.  It was great!  They were eager to learn, and I was eager to share.  They thanked me for broadening their horizons

Fast forward three months.  Since I'm on so many medications

That didn't happen.

After waiting for my name to be called, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, the works.  They brought up my psychiatric history as well as my most recent hospitilizations.  I wasn't expecting to talk about my history of suicidal ideation when I just wanted to get BC pills!  I felt vulnerable and uncomfortable; the topic seemed absolutely inappropriate for what I was there for.

Finally, but that is not one of those things.  If there's anything I'm proud and certain of about myself, it's my sexual orientation and gender identity.  I tried telling them as such, but they kept pressing me, explicitly suggesting that my depression, anxiety, and suicidal feelings were due to gender confusion.  

It hurt so much to be told that my problems were due to being genderqueer.  I'm plenty aware that I'm mentally ill, but I do expect to be respected.  I don't think that's too much to ask.

I don't know what I'm looking for in posting this.  Sympathy? Commiseration? Insight from other genderqueer people who also happen to struggle with mental illness?  All I know is that it feels good to tell my story.  Thanks for listening.

K and I are both 23, but her identity is a bit more complicated than that. She strongly considered transitioning to male when she started college but eventually decided she is not a man. She's admitted to me that she also does not identify as a woman. Tentatively, she's used the term genderqueer, even though she hates how political that word sounds. My best way to describe her would probably be ""effeminate transmasculine queer person"" (not exactly a catchy title, but at least a combination of the ways she's described herself). Regardless of the way you put it, though, her gender ambiguity has caused her a lot of pain and angst that she's still struggling with.

We joke about K being stone butch. It's not totally accurate, but I want to give her pleasure as well. When I'm focusing on her, she says something stops her from feeling it and it suddenly seems like she's floating above herself. Sometimes she thinks she might have orgasmed, but she can't say for sure since she feels so disconnected from her body. It's difficult for her to give me feedback about what feels good because of this. I've asked her to show or tell me what she does when she masturbates, but she told me she has this trouble even more when she's riding solo.

The other night, if at all, but she always replies that she really doesn't know what she wants.

I guess I'm just at a loss. I don't want to pressure her, I'll go down on her for 20 minutes and she just begs to fuck me instead. It's not like she hasn't tried masturbating, or vibrators, or the usual bag of tricks. And while I want her to feel good and comfortable and horny in the body she has now, I also know that her dysphoria is very real and can't be fixed by run of the mill body acceptance spiels.

I guess I'm just asking for any suggestions you might have. I love K so much and just want to help her carve out a niche she feels alive in. Have you overcome similar problems? How would you like your cisgendered partners to approach a topic like this? What questions do you wish they'd ask?

Hey everyone

I'm Dogenwolf

I was born male but growing up always felt most comfortable alternating my dress between both genders and sometimes blending the two. I always felt a bit alienated even from my gay friends who were certain about their gender; even the guys who wear makeup when they go out to the club always identified as being very much male. I never knew what it meant to have a fixed perception of your own gender and now that I have a rudimentary understand of the term genderqueer

I feel liberated

Two weeks ago I felt my identity shift towards the feminine and I followed the tide out. A week ago I felt a shift towards the masculine and I followed the tide back in. I no longer fight it

I also find that it's given me more security when it comes to my sexuality as well and I feel more inclined to investigate those parts of my sexuality that I felt were improper. I feel more secure with myself, am proud and excited to be who I am, whoever that may be at any given time. It's fitting that I'm a Pisces (mutable water sign), too. The most notorious unstable sign, but I've found that in embracing my unstable identity I have found something incredibly stable and predictable. Yes, it shifts constantly like the moon, but now I *understand*.

I feel that gender is a construct, I don't mind the rest of the world not hearing the 'genderqueer' qualifier and just seeing me as a man when I'm out and about interacting with them (and I can be a pretty lady on my own

The one person who's an exception... is my girlfriend. She knows that I crossdress. She's fine with it, she asked me to describe my sexuality to her in as much detail as possible, so she could really understand where I am on that spectrum. (To be honest, since I don't really believe in gender as a fixed thing, you probably won't be surprised to hear that I don't really have a fixed sexuality :p but the closest is bisexual). My girlfriend is asexual, so we are both in not-so-straightforward sexuality categories. She was really good about getting to understand my perspective on that, and early in the relationship we talked about sexuality a lot. (We don't talk about it much any more since we are comfortable with each other after being together for over a year now).

But she never has asked me 'please tell me about your gender in as much detail as possible'. So although she *knows* about my 'woman' side, and she laughed and said ""you're not a girl!"". In this situations I usually shrug it off and say ""hah, well..."" and trail off without saying anything.

To be honest, that doesn't change who I am. She has never been mean about it. I don't feel that it impedes my quality of life much or at all. It's just that at those moments, I guess the girl inside of me feels like she's being silenced, and the man (who gets most of the control of my mouth!) never stands up for her.

I don't know what to do. Is it worth bringing this up with her? Has anyone had to have a conversation like that? How did it go? What would be a good way to bring it up? I don't want to make her feel bad or overstate the situation... but I don't want to trivialise and ignore my identity around the most important person in my life

Another complication is that my girlfriend is very interested in feminist issues. I consider myself a feminist as well, who is not straight but has a girlfriend, so is not obviously LGBT+ to the outside world. My girlfriend is not white, nor a man. I don't want to come across as sort of 'bandwagoning' myself into being a minority, or like I'm pretending the issues that minorities can suffer from are a big problem for me as well. This is especially relevant in that geek girl conversation - I'm sure every redditor knows that geeks who come across as women can have a pretty hard time sometimes. I'm in no danger of being seen as a woman by most people, so I don't have those problems. But I do consider myself *in some ways* a girl, and certainly a geek. So I don't want to be included in the group of 'people who suffer as a result of being both a geek and a girl', however atypical my experience of that is.

&gt;Because you'd make the best most caring and intelligent boyfriend ever. You pretty much have it all.

It was so incredibly flattering. Lately I've come to accept that


When I joined reddit, wanting to educate myself so I would never have to inadvertently stick my foot in my mouth and upset someone else. I only knew trans* individuals from a chat I belonged to online, so I figured hey, I want to know more, so I especially digged into trans* issues. Found a ftm (though not very friendly) chat, and wanted to learn more. The chat didn't last long for me, and I didn't find it helpful.


All while this was happening, I decided – even if I was happy with my body, I would lose weight to be healthier.


As it went on, it just felt like he had no interest for my body anymore, so between trying to lose weight, it being a frustratingly slow process, and finding myself ugly, I really began to hate my body. Before all of this, I accepted that I was a woman. I never questioned myself or thought of myself as genderqueer. It never was on my mind – even if I've been quite the tomboy as a kid and even as an adult.


Of the past few days, it's a lot to swallow. My mind doesn't feel 100% femme and I realized that some (not all) of my unhappiness comes with me feeling awkward in my body. I'm at an age where I'm supposed to dress quite feminine (especially as a professional) and I really just want to say “fuck you” to the system.


As I slowly lose more weight I think I will be happier with my body. I am hoping to feel at one with myself again, I find dicks pretty damn ugly and I would hate to get bottom or top surgery. I'm at a body type where I would NEVER look good as a man, but I do look nice dressed somewhat masculine (I have described it to others as quite preppy or athletic). And definitely exciting, I will only look better as I lose more weight.


So those texts were absolutely amazing to read. I've thought about male names I would want if I were born male, it was extremely flattering and just rubbed me all the right ways. I have not come out to anyone. I mentioned it to my partner before he left for basic military training but he has no idea to the extent that I feel. I am afraid that he will not accept me and will not want to be with me. But then another part of me finds that silly, as I'm not changing, I'm merely putting a label to how I've been my entire life.

I'm sure many of you are familiar with the [Kinsey Scale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinsey_Scale), but I still feel it's lacking in a number of ways. 

Namely, it fails to differentiate between sex and gender with regards to attraction.  Maybe a person's self-identity is important to if you find them attractive, but their physical sex isn't, or visa versa.  Or possibly it's how masculine/feminine they are, regardless of either of the above factors.

I'd like to create a new scale/system for describing sexual orientation in a more inclusive/full way



Here's my ideas so far: basically, is best described by a matrix.  At it's most basic, it would be a 2x2 matrix like this:

    [A1 A2]
    [B1 B2]

You could have one of the axes (let's say the horizontal one) refer to sex while the other one refers to gender.  For example, and everything in the bottom row refers to someone who identifies as female.    So, if you're following me, A1 would be someone whose sex is female and gender identity is male.  A2 would be someone whose sex and gender identity are male.  B1 would be someone whose sex and Gender identity are female, and B2 would be someone whose sex is male and gender identity is female.  

Given this information, and can go either way on sex, your gender identity might go like this:

    [0 0]
    [8 8]


Conversely

    [8 0]
    [7 0]

Both these people would describe themselves as liking women (based on the Kinsey scale), two very different sexual orientations.  Someone who's asexual, but romantically interested in everyone might have something like this:

    [2  2]
    [2  2]

Where-as someone who is only interested in people whose sex and gender are male

    [0  9]
    [0  0]

I'm thinking the scale should range from ""people in this group interest me about as much as your average rock"" to ""I would basically have sex with every single person in this group


Of course, people who identify as feminine men, masculine women, etc.  For sex, you would want to make a space for intersex people as well as various points ways of transitioning for trans people.  Here's what a larger matrix might look like:

    [ A1  A2  A3  A4 ]  
    [ B1  B2  B3  B4 ]  
    [ C1  C2  C3  C4 ]

I like my male body. If I was female, with the acceptance that this is my personal preference and that there is nothing *inherently* worse about being female-bodied.

However, the patriarchy, etc. The thought that the gender I identify with is responsible for such oppression of women and sexual minorities fills me with shame and frustration. Even more so than how I dislike the pressures associated with the social construction of masculinity, I feel guilt about the social pressures and discrimination I avoided by being born male instead of female. 

It bothers me that I am so opposed to the social connotations, and say that although I am physically male, I reject the social gender identity that goes with it. Is it wrong to want this? Is achieving this impossible?

What I didn't tell her at first was that I spent most of my early life looking into gender studies and always felt myself as being trans(f2m) I remember reading an article about a woman who got a sex change to male in her 40s - after she was married with children. It struck such a cord with me when I was a kid. I even went so far as to do a lot of research and think about reconsigment surgery. It wasn't until I was talking to a trans friend of mine about it, I kept my hair short, my friends were boys, and in high school I even adapted a boy's name as a nickname. So I did.. I lived life as a female from age 19 onward. Fast foward to now - I'm married, with 2 kids. My husband knows of my past and my feelings - he's been with me since I was a teen - but admits he loves the female side of me. 

And with my friend talking to me about her husband, and that I'm doing a disservice to the trans world because even though I feel inherently male, I still live in a female body, but I don't want to live a half life. I don't want to have to feel like I need to justify myself in why I feel like this and why I don't think I can change. Not because I'm worried about my husband, or my kids, but because in some weird way I'm so adapted now to life as a female I don't know if I can ever be just ONE gender. I'm not really feeling anymore like I am just male, or just female

Let me first state that I am not gender dysphoric; for me to have the confidence to let myself cross-dress I had to first really look at my body and realize that I really do like my male-body and I enjoy being male

What's got me thinking I am bigender is that when I am *en femme* there are subtle changes in the way I behave and think. I fold my underwear before putting it away, and I prefer music by female musicians. What's really got me freaked out is that when I am *en femme* I love wearing a bra, and what I love even more is being able to fill out the bra (artificially of course, using rice in tied-off pantyhose feet). Wearing a stuffed bra feels so natural to me, and I often find myself forgetting I am wearing a bra or have fake boobs, reminding myself only when they get in the way of my arms or vision. Yesterday I found myself wrapping my arms around my bust and enjoying the look and feel of my chest and wishing they were real and I could always have breasts. However, when I'm not *en femme*...this weirds me out, and have no desire to permanently stop being male.

So, and I switch between expressing my personality through my male identity and female identity.

I want to keep trying because he's not being purposefully hateful


""For me you are just UnicornPower420, and please dont say i dont because i am truthfull to my word but why should we dwell on such a difference of perception. I see you as a girl, you don't see it that way and i respect you for that but don't force me to do things which i don't believe in. I mean, I could bullshit you and say that I am totally comfortable with calling you they but i'm just not. I don't understand why you lose your respect for me when i am trying to be honest towards you. Having respect for each other doesn't mean you should totally understand each other but you let the other live his life like he wants too without inteference or at least it does for me.""


I told him to imagine he was saying those things about my orientation instead of my gender, but it didn't seem to work. I even conceded that he didn't have to use my pronouns or be a decent ally or anything, just try to be understanding. I also told him that he's trying to put me in a closet to make himself more comfortable and that's shitty. That seems to have made him defensive.


""What I understand from your message is that you don't feel comfortable being around me while knowing that I think of you as a girl. I am not uncomfortable about your mixed feeling about your gender and i acknowledge it. I never said that you should act as a girl because i want you to. I only said that i perceive you as a girl and for me you are one.""


I don't even with this last part though:
""But having hurt feelings doesn't give you the moral high ground. I feel you are making no effort at all to see my point of view, not against it in any way but you won't see me standing on the barricades waving the rainbow flag. That is just the way it is, there are probably things i feel strongly about and you don't. But I'll give you all the room you need to give outing to your gender but don't expect from me that i become just as passionate about it as you. In a way you are doing the same thing as the anti-transgender people. You are like the believer who doesn't want to hear anything else then what appeals to his believes. You get shocked and upset when you find out that not all people share the same opinions on things. Well that is life, there are probably tons of people who don't like me or my opinions but it is there right to do so. Difference is what makes the world go around. This doesn't mean that transgenders should be beat up because there different but it also doesn't mean that everyone should agree with them. I always had a great time hanging out with you so why should we get stuck on this subject. I understand that being transgender is a major part of you and again i respect that side of you but also leave room for me to have my own opinions. Why are you setting all these rules and boundaries for us to hang out. You are not to weird for me or anything but please don't become like those zealots who can't stand a slight difference of opinion and want everyone to walk the same path, wear the same clothes and think alike because that is one of the few things i can't stand. I tried my best to describe my feelings, I hope you'll understand what i am trying to say.""

How can I explain that our opinions on this matter are absolutely not equally valid? Like it's so obviously bullshit to me but I don't know what to say about it that will make sense to him. I really don't want to give up yet since I have an opportunity to educate

I think in the city, however, the restrictive ideals of the small town I'm is has forced me to either conform to their ideals about gender, or be treated like I'm less than human. At first I conformed, I'm not even sure I was aware I was doing it.

Over time gender conforming felt more and more like a prison

In the city I felt that people, however, it feels like everybody's view of everybody else is colored by what gender they're perceived to be. There are very strong stereotypes here about the differences between males and females, men and women. I've found that it only gets worse if you try to present as something outside the gender binary. I've noticed a gradual increase in disapproval from my bosses at work, though my co-workers and friends have been great.

Ever since I was a young teenager

I had tried minor crossdressing, but perhaps I was just finding some way of acting out within the abusive household I was in.  After a while this lost it's appeal, and I never did understand quite why. Though this did roughly coincide with the time I got out of that abusive situation.

I've since kept going, I would see a pretty girl and I would get feelings I really didn't understand.  I would be attracted to them, but I would also have some negative feeling alongside it. 

About a year ago, of the way they moved. I began to think maybe I was transexual, maybe I was exhibiting a mild bit of gender dysphoria or something, which considering I would occasionally fantasize about being a woman could make some sense.  However I had no desire to go through any of surgeries or that type of thing.  But as I started to spend more time considering it, I started coming to more realizations.  

I like being a guy.  But I wouldn't mind being a girl, it'd be status quo from the other side of the isle.  However, the more time I spent thinking about this, the more I realized that even that wasn't quite true.  As I've said, I like being a guy, and being overwieght like I am, I've always had a bit of a body image issue. 

Recently I began to notice that despite my excessive weight, in my thighs, in my arms, and my face.  But I'm not ashamed of the chest.  There's something there, something that pushes out.  Regardless of how unnatural it would seem I was happy with my fat chest.  But even up until week ago I still had gone nowhere with this.

However

[Then I saw this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/12u481/1_year_and_hormones_later_i_have_never_felt_as/) and while there wasn't anything specific in that thread, all the sidebar stuff.  The lists of resources, the faqs, the posts in the subreddits.

/r/genderqueer really resonated with me, I was coming up with answers.  Not to everything, but these were answers to questions I had never even known where to start, so I've really started getting a new understanding of myself.

Suddenly my life started making more sense than it ever had before.  I had answers to old questions and I had new questions which were getting some answers too.  And that brings me to today.

I've had a lot of time over the last couple of days to be introspective.

I'm starting to learn who I am.  Sure

Sure, I'm content to just know that there's both a place where people are asking the questions and finding the answers I'm starting to consider, or even questions I haven't thought of yet. And that there is a place where I can talk to others when I really don't know how to interpret something myself.

The point of all of this is... **Thank you.**  Thank you for being here for others.  Thank you for being here for youself.  Even if I'm new here thank you preemptively for being here for me.  Just... thank you to the entire community.

I identify as non binary, etc to bring myself closer to the gender I feel.

I would also like to try low dose HRT (M to F)

1. What dosage constitutes low dose HRT ?
2. I have heard people say that taking a little Estrogen might get the body to produce more Testosterone. However
3. Does Dutesteride effect mental cognition (I have read this on a few hair loss forums) ?
4. Is it possible to go all natural if low dose HRT is all I want ? What is your opinion of the following regimen (Licorice + Spearmint Tea + Tofu + Soy Milk)
5. What kind of physical and psychological changes can I expect from low dose HRT ?
6. Are the risks of blood clotting also low when taking low dose HRT
7. If you are already in low dose HRT

I've found myself questioning my gender identity.  I know for sure that I am not cisgender.  After that

Since coming out I've had a number of moments in which I thought I was absolutely sure that I was a transwoman.  I've had some moments when I thought I might be bi/tri/3rd gender or gender fluid.  I'm still pretty confused on the matter.

At this very moment, internally.  I've had thoughts like ""you just have to play with equipment you're given"" and I'm questioning whether the whole thing was just some kind of dream.

One reason that I didn't come to the conclusion that I'm trans* earlier was because I looked at my friend J (ftm; hormones + top surgery only) who was so clear about his gender identity and thought, I know that there's a lot more to trans* than simply wanting to be on the opposite end of the binary.

Whenever I'm out and I see women, I don't hate my body.  I mean, it's a nice enough body.  It just feels foreign.  And yet not foreign at the same time.  Familiar perhaps?

Not that it's actually based in science, like they don't belong.

**tl;dr** I often feel like I want to be a woman.  Right now I'm depressed and also questioning my gender identity.

When I first came to college, and just about everybody I was friends with was somehow aligned with the LGBTQ community in some way, so this didn't come across as strange. I was just filled with questions about what it was. When they explained to me exactly what that was, I quietly accepted it and began to think about myself. I had come out as gay when I was 13 but that never seemed to quite capture how I felt. I had questioned my gender heavily when I was 14 and told a friend about it. She was overwhelmingly supportive, and helped me get through some of what I now know is dysphoria. I had kind of played with the idea of telling my parents about it in hopes of maybe getting hormones to kind of delay some of puberty, but never acted on it. (By the way, I'm fairly ignorant in terms of hormones and have a few basic questions that I'll ask later.) 

Once I finally figured out what genderqueer was, I didn't *hate* being male, I just wasn't a huge fan of it. I figured that there had already been 18 years as only being male, why not switch it up with a few female pronouns every now and then? Recently I saw the subreddit that was dedicated to timelines throughout peoples' transitions, and instantly saw how the happy the people in the after pictures were. I thought about all of those times I would break down crying when I looked in the mirror when I was a scared 14 year old and wanted to give myself a hug and explain that I wasn't broken, but that it was something that I should embrace and cherish and love. I knew after seeing the first person that had the same body type and facial structure at me transition from a handsome man to a beautiful woman and knew that I could be the one having the best time of my life.

Hi. I'm Al.

So! I identify as androgynous, because Murphy's Law. I've never really found my neutral tendencies to be bothersome, though I have to admit there are times when I am acutely aware of not being female (which is my sex).

I took a gender neutral name

Have breasts the size of cantaloupes... 

And therein lies my discomfort. I can look on a mirror and be perfectly happy... As long as I don't look below my shoulders. Tried a binder once, and thank gods I've lost some there, too... Not a lot, but enough that I notice. Thought about trying a binder again, but I'm too poor to buy one right now. Not sure I'm prepared to drop the cash on it with such a risk of failure is at hand... But I really, really hate my breasts. Always have.

Hnn...

The other bane of my existence is that no one seems to get it. I have a penchant for cute things... Also, and thus have been used as evidence against me and my gender identity. ""You like X-girlie thing, so you're a woman."" What about the X-boy things I like, or the gender neuter things? Or the fact that my likes and dislikes don't actually dictate my gender identity? I have a hard time trying to explain it to people... I get frustrated, especially when they try to get out of it by way of, ""whatever you say (even though I still think you're mental).""

And I have no idea how to explain it to my mother

They call me by my given name, and it doesn't suit me. I figure if I could make them understand the need for my neutral name, perhaps I could get them to call me by it, but... They're old fashioned folk, and, as I said, I have no idea of how to explain it to them.

I work in a grocery store. A couple of months ago I got my hair cut in a very short, because I think the kids can get it much more easily. I like my job, though, so I kept my happiness quietly...

I dunno... Maybe I'm having more trouble getting used to this than I thought I was? I have no issues with myself, because to them I'm being ""that girl.""

So far my suggested options are:

1. Don't go. This is my usual choice. It feels wrong that I should have to be excluded from this event because of being bad at gendernorms

2. Wear a dress. NO. NO. This will not happen

3. Wear a tux, but I don't think I could handle strangers staring at me. Apart from being terrified of this attention though, I would be comfortable with the clothing itself.

I like being strong and athletic, doing hard labor and being a man in bed. But... I don't feel overly attached to the label.

This has only been my experience, not necessarily as a gender identity unto itself. Those who assert an identity have tended to have a more specific term they prefer when giving a name to their gender identity. 

Those I meet who use genderqueer as their primary identity have tended to be CAFAB. CAMAB (specifically non-transsexual) people who ""fit"" the common understanding of genderqueer have been quick to label themselves in other ways: sissy, prettyboy, and some even have taken on metrosexual as a sepcific gender identity. I have my suspicions on why CAMAB people and CAFAB people have such different representation, but I wanted to hear from you all.

I still don't often make friends with girls. I prefer boys

I really do think that I am not the identity I currently use. I am not a girl. I'm not a boy

Sorry for the rambling nature of this post. I get really nervous when I post online about this sort of thing. 

I really need help with identifying myself. First off

I would say when I was about 14 years old I began to fantasize about being turned into a woman. I researched and was under the belief I was a transsexual for years and years. However

I met my SO 3 years ago. She is wonderful and dating her pretty much made my desire to be female disappear. She doesn't know about any of this nor do I plan on telling her. 

I get in these moods where all I can think about is being female. Then I get into moods where I don't think about being female for weeks.  I try to battle that by playing games online exclusively as female and posting on sports and gaming forums as female. It helps... sometimes. 

Anyway, fluidgender. Can anyone highlight what you believe I described?  It really has opened up my life since I discovered this stuff a few weeks ago. Because I always thought I was just pushing the feminine desires away because it would be too hard or difficult. 

But if I can learn how to embrace both genders than I believe I could live a lot happier life.

Thanks for reading.

About a year ago I met a girl that was gender-queer. I learned this once I got over the awkwardness and had to ask her what gender she is. She laughed and explained that she likes androgyne (and finds it funny when people are confused) And I thought it was cool but didn't start to seriously consider it until very recently. I think noticed a page about the ""COGIATI"" which I know doesn't need to be taken super seriously

So the thought has been there to start to more accurately reflect this, but I also don't want it to be so obvious I'm male.

This is just an alt account that I'm posting from because I'm still a bit embarrassed about this.  I'm a 27 year old biologically male homosexual.  I'm generally happy being a man.  I guess by that I mean I wouldn't trade my penis for anything.

But at the same time, and is still never any sexual attraction to ladies.  Also, as far a sexual matters go, I'm exclusively passive when it comes to sex.  I'd generally say I like the more feminine roles I guess.  

When I hit puberty, I grew breasts.  They ended up being large As/small Bs.  After getting checked by a doctor, mainly because of being embarrassed and confused about being a guy with boobs, they were definitely breast tissue and not a product of being overweight (which I never was).  Another thing is that I never really grew any body hair.  I have some very sparce hair on my arms and legs, but that's it aside from pubic hair.  Suffice to say, this has been a source embarassment and confusion at times.

All of this has recently come to a head for me since I've come out as gay a year and a half ago.  Since I've come to terms with my sexual orientation

I dunno, but it really bothers me when I think about getting into a relationship that whoever I'm with will feel decieved if they meet me as more masculine and discover that I have a really huge feminine side.  Or if they meet me when I'm more feminine, they won't be interested in me because I'm not masculine enough.  I'd really like to know how other people deal with problems like this.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Part One: The Road Less Travelled By

If I could go back nothing would change. It’s funny how the thorns that has dug into my emotional state for so long could be attached to flowers so precious, no matter how great the feeling of a smooth life of it would be. But perhaps troubles create preciousness? If abnormal were normal, and normal is the worst punishment of all, should I ever really want my “abnormal” to conform to something I’ve so often thought of as a shallow disguise to fit in with an ever changing flow because “difference is scary” in the “everyone else is doing it” generation.

But it’s not a generation is it? Thousands of years of an ever changing cut and paste. Everything’s changing except what we want, and the majority calls for oppression. Hiding behind a veil of “progressiveness” just because you treat one group slightly less like the dirt you wiped off your shoe. Equal rights are oppression of the majority, but excusing their faults cause ours are more grave. Love isn’t love anymore, love is a conditional response, and I haven’t fulfilled the requirements.

I tried to fill these conditions once. I submitted my claim, I can’t follow it because our lights don’t “complement” each other. Because no one cares if it leads to the destination because my path isn’t the “right one.” I think Robert Frost had the right idea in that road less travelled by.

The path is rough, but I knew as soon as I went through the arch I knew what I was going to leave behind. And so we’ve come full circle, because I tried my best to love, but did those I love do it back of their own accord or another condition? And once the door closed, the fear set in, that I broke the contract and lost it all, because my conditions were no longer met. So enough of the allegories, this is my reality. A reality where there’s no conditions

Part 2: A Monster Called Gender

Who could’ve forseen the irony of where it’d all begin? Under the watchful eye of those that would condemn me, it was the only thing at the moment that felt right. All I was taught was fear and pain and unquestioning obedience, but the moment with him was an oasis, no different than any moment I felt with a she. And the only thing that had felt so right in so long, brought forth the terrible realization of a world that’s so wrong.

Now let me make it clear, or were they ever really close? Could I ever truly be close to those that would be the first to condemn the feelings of intuition. It was a fear, a fear so great that it clawed at the edges of my mind, screaming to be let out, yet it screamed in silence as I droned about school life. Being a “good Christian boy” during the day time, keeping the monster in quiet submission as I was taught to lead unquestioningly, because questioning was only a fast-track to damnation. And yet at night I could drop the façade, feeling a sincere and innocent embrace that felt as though the monster of my fear were not just silence

But the transformation was just a temporary solution, as would ruin its justice. For this was the most ineloquent and destructive, yet powerful and saving moment of my life. 

The breeze was cool, but there was no comfort in any part of this moment. The ledge I sat on quickly began to feel like a lifting slope, threatening to slide me into the depths of the concrete below. But I was my own catalyst, and what I had grown to believe was the biggest threat of all. But could this be it? I stared down 5 stories and realized that the end I so bitterly sought, wasn’t what I sought at all. What I sought was an end, an end to gender. And the trip began slowly, painfully, but I’ve learned so much

Part 3: Genderqueer?

It’s amazing how long something can hide. Feelings so ingrained from the beginning that I could remember, workouts, and sports, as though there were a mold to fit everyone. And yet I was told there was only black and white, two opposites, the boy and girl. But with only two hemispheres, why did I feel like I didn’t fit on the map? It was as though black and white were all the same shade of grey. 

Is this why I couldn’t belong? Who could I tell? All my feelings cast aside in the name of redemption? And yet mind and body in a mismatch by the coercion of everything I had been taught. A match for positive and negative, harder by the minute, rewarding by the second.

Years have passed reversing through the window that almost closed the book. So much has changed, the ability to come close to the inherent preciousness of every color. And yet one has caught my eye, no not one color, but one person so precious, every color shines through. A love that colors could intertwine, a mixture of pure joy and innocence. And yet there was a color missing. In a world so full of color, could I still only see my shade of grey?

And yet I could never have forseen the liberator of my own colorless feelings. The kindness of a stranger, but it had exactly what was needed to get a glimpse of the color hiding underneath the façade forced upon me from an assigned birth. 

Sizes too small, dropping the forced idea of masculinity, and yet feeling no femininity, but only me. Knowing full well I could be called “fag” “drag queen” and other useless empty words from the closed mind of indoctrination. But for those brief moments, full of laughter and blushing, skirts and v-necks, tops and capris

Everything felt as though it fit. The pieces matched, no circular language for these individuals. And so it is with the ending of an ineloquent rant about the ineloquent past of genderblind genderqueer being shown true colors, I thank the ones that I have led me here. I thank Zach, though we speak little now, and though our encounter was rough around the edges, it pushed me to think, despite everything around us saying no. I thank all of those that have helped and supported me throughout my development, but to close to forget. I thank you Colleen for giving a stranger such kindness to feel alright with myself, and given me the most vibrant of colors in the purest of love, and nothing can pull them away as we journey together to keep our colors

I just don't consider it a deciding factor for the way any other aspect of my life is. I dress the way I want. I dress in clothes that fit and look good on my body. I have a fairly androgynous style

I'm going through pictures of myself on Facebook from this past weekend and I think

I look fat. Plain and simple. Women's clothing is typically designed to show off our curves. Some clothing is designed to flatter them. 

I am pretty fit (not to be confused with skinny), because when I look in the mirror, I like my body. I'm not too curvy (or so I think), so I imagine I can get away with looking androgynous while wearing skinny jeans. I guess not. Pictures tell a different story than the mirror. I have big hips. And I'm fat. And when I wear women's clothing, I look ridiculous because I don't have a particularly feminine body, even though I'm a healthy, fit female.

I got these black skinny jeans that fit me like a glove. I thought they showed off my super muscular thighs. I thought no other pants fit me as well as these. No. They just just accentuate my fat thighs and big hips. 

Today I put on boy's jeans and a wife-beater (is there another word for those tank tops? what a terrible word..). I felt good about the way I look today. 

I'm just feeling really down. I don't know what I am anymore. I guess this is more of a body acceptance issue than a genderqueer one? Maybe both? I'm confused about myself. I can't distinguish my feminine curves from fat. 

I don't really know what I'm asking. Maybe somebody could help shed some light or relate or give me some perspective? Or an opinion? What ever.

I'm a 23-year-old male-bodied person. I've always identified as a man even while being aware of the Transgender and Genderqueer communities

I've grown my hair long my whole life, otherwise I don't have any strong feelings about my body hair or other feelings of body or gender dysphoria. I sometimes shave my legs and always shave under my arms, but I don't feel strongly about having them shaved or not. In fact I don't feel really strongly in any way about appearing fairly masculine or appearing feminine. I'm pretty comfortable with either form of dress and don't really think of it as being super comfortable or uncomfortable. I feel fully at home if I'm presenting androgynously and it makes me extra comfortable to do so. I used to marker my nails black for a while in grade school until I felt uncomfortable about people mentioning it and only started painting them regularly (still only black) a year ago. Occasionally I'll wear eye-liner and I would do so more if I was better at applying it. I also wear concealer, mostly to try to cover up my 5 o'clock shadow. I have never considered myself to be crossdressing regardless of which sex my clothing was designed for. 

The most time I've ever spent questioning my gender identity was when I was dating a wonderful Trans woman that wasn't entirely sure whether I was Cis based on some of the things I expressed. The questioning went kind of like this: ""Hmm.. how do I feel about my body? This is a pretty okay shape. Penis? That's cool. How would I feel about breasts? Eh

I was writing a blog post tonight about being a ""Political Man"" in that I do all of these things but still feel that I should strongly assert my manhood because I think that being a man should include the possibility of skirts and makeup and it's better for society to do away with a lot of masculine tropes. I was also talking about the fact that I don't really have a problem with being misgendered because I have Cis privilege

Now I'm feeling really lost. I don't feel like I fit anything I've heard about genderqueer people. I've always been comfortable in my binary, and I'm not even sure why I feel like crying.

These last three weeks have been awful. I am fighting depression, interacting with family. My best friend, who knows about my gender problems, told me last night that it seems like I haven't been comfortable in my own skin. 

I'm not sure what else I can do. I am wearing almost entirely men's clothing. I bind, but it would be really nice to get misgendered and not have people falling all over themselves to correct it. I got sir'd the other day and the guy apologized like twelve times and I said ""it's okay, you're mostly right"" and he said ""Why, that's an awful thing to say!"" :/

My body just feels wrong. My hips are too wide. My shoulders are too narrow. I have a classic hourglass figure. I can kinda hide it

I have been thinking a lot about where this all comes from, but I just wonder if this is something to focus on since I'm largely unhappy anyhow. I wonder if I feel like I need to make changes because I am angry about what social things being a woman means. How much of this is social, and how much of it is who I really am? For some reason it seems okay to me if it's organic, but not if it's social. I don't know why.

I was thinking a lot about my childhood yesterday, I started having panic attacks. There were a lot of other things going on - my mother was very controlling about other things too, but it hadn't occurred to me that the anxiety I had all through childhood might have been related to my gender. 

I'm wondering if it's time to start considering some more biological changes

Questions:
1) What exactly is someone who is gender queer? I'm guessing that it goes beyond being ""tomboy"" or ""girly"". However

2) Is gender queer coupled with homosexuality? For example

3) Is it possible for someone so young to be gender queer? I've heard (and this may be completely wrong) that homosexuality tends to come to light

For a while in high school and early college I wanted to go by Samantha because to me it flowed better and went better with my last name. But before realizing I'm genderqueer I already was going by Sam (my work name tag even says Sam instead of Samantha, I've been thinking about the possibility of going by a different one. For one thing, when I go by Sam, people still assume the right to call me Samantha. Also, most Sams I know are girls so it's more often associated with Samantha anyways. 

A reason this jumped in my head lately is because the name ""Caleb"" appeared. I hadn't even really been thinking about changing my name, it's considered a male name. I'm not the least bit binary identified, I don't even consider myself trans-masculine or in-between male and female. I'm just not a woman. My gender has no relation or connection to binary genders at all. So, that's in a way a drawback. But it also sort of fits because it challenges gendered names and also separates me more from being a woman than I otherwise would be. But it doesn't sound really masculine either, so it's nice. And I really like it. Another drawback is that I don't know how it sounds with my last name (alliteration, lol). But on the other hand it'll be a few years before I use it more officially because I'm not ready to be completely out. Another name I thought of was Morgan, because I always really liked the name, think it's more a girl's name. Which isn't a great fix for people thinking my name is feminine

What do you guys think? 

*edit*: I feel like at this point the only thing keeping me from going with Caleb is how it fits with my last name. I mentioned these names to a friend and we both voted off Morgan.

Anyways, kinky and a switch. Been fairly open about most of these and I'm surrounded by open and accepting friends at college right now which is great. So why not add another label to confuse people with right? 

For years my sister and closest friend have bugged me to dress up in drag for Halloween and for some reason this idea always made me really really embarrassed. I couldn't tell it then, the whole drag idea fell through when I didn't have enough time to get an outfit together, s.o instead I went as a lumberjack from Monty Python, complete with padded bra. 

The party was fun, I'm a behemoth of a man with hair that is just starting to grow out.) Instead of making me feel embarrassed or peeved, I felt pleased. I distinctly remember thinking, ""Yes! It's working!"" and for the rest of my shift it was if I was walking on sunshine. That night, in an effort to be a bit more feminine I decided to shave a bunch of my body hair in the shower, something I've kept up to this day I enjoy the feeling so much. 

So I'm either genderqueer, or just have a giant fetish for crossdressing. One of those, not sure which yet. Still need to explore a bit, which brings me to my second and not as happy point.

I'm not in a good place to explore this at all currently. It's not my financial situation, ain't that a shame? 

It still leaves me with my hair

For the last few days, my life, and where I'm going, and specifically I've been trying to think about gender identity and expression, and I just wrote this journal entry and wanted to share it.


**Monday

Last night I couldn't help but think about gender, or whatever way to describe that I don't feel strictly one way or another.  I have many times in the past found myself wishing I was female, more androgynous, that I was a lesbian trapped in a male body.  Sometimes I really wish I could change my sex at the push of a button.  I texted &lt;my friend&gt; to get her input.  Sometimes I feel like I'd like to see what hormone replacement was like, so I could understand how it affects my personality or if it would make me feel better or worse.  I've been thinking for some time now of some way I can express my femme, like painting my nails or shaving my legs or wearing a skirt.

**Monday

I'm so gripped right now with trying to understand my own identity, I want to be the punk butch, the strong alpha female, the innocent naive girl, I want my image to reflect the way I want to express myself that day.  I've never defined myself as a male.  I think the world imprinted on me an image of what I should be, and I strove to become that image, but I've never felt that feeling come from somewhere inside me.  Of course I want things that might be considered masculine, I want to be a good parent to my children.  Sometimes I do appreciate my male form, I want to be small, and I felt a little surge of excitement - my personality can be perceived as female.  I just wish my body could.  Past couple days have been very emotional for me.  I cried the other day just to do it.  I was watching something or listening to some music

As the title suggests

I first came across the term gender queer when a friend (who I have since lost contact with) described herself as such. I tried to get a better understanding of what she meant, sometimes I feel feminine"" with her continuing on saying sometimes she likes wearing dresses, and sometimes she likes wearing pants. 

I am still very much confused as to what exactly being gender queer is like. If I describe myself in terms of 'typically' masculine and feminine things, myself, feel 'male' or 'female' that day, and I even feel that sometimes my personality changes slightly to exhibit features of the gender I am that day (it's not intentional, however, it feels like a natural change when I'm being myself). Growing up, I was often considered a tomboy. I wore male clothing most of the time, but I honestly don't think that I would mind. Even when presenting as female I sometimes wish people wouldn't think of me in terms of gender

My boyfriend knows all about me and how I feel, it applies to me. 

During masturbation I sometimes think about having my own penis, as in trying to get surgery, but I really don't care about having a vagina either. If I woke up male tomorrow, I wouldn't really be phased, and I don't really care either way.

I feel like I fit the description of gender queer (if I'm wrong feel free to correct me). At the same time I don't see the point of it. I'm female, and I don't care if I'm female... and because of that why WOULDN'T I just call myself female, since that at least applies to something physical. I feel like the idea that I may be gender queer irrelevant.

Hi there

It all started when I was about 12 (now 19) when I started to get envious of girls over, playing in the football (soccer) team, Rugby team and water polo team as well as doing a little fencing at the school. I was ok with being a guy, but every so often would wonder what if I were a girl.

At 15 I started hanging around some girls from an all girl school close by and it started making me feel dysphoric again. I questioned a lot about myself

It was at this time that I started truly writing music that I felt had any meaning and substance to it. I started to feel as though the fluidity and interplay of counter melodies I created symbolised how I felt about my gender, which at first I was aimed at myself, but later became aimed at the world for making me think I couldn't express myself.

Fast forward to now and I suddenly go on reddit, being both and niether at the same time. I love being a guy at times, but at others I hate it... It's hard to verbalise how I actually feel, like there aren't the words in the English language to describe it (or that I just lack the eloquence to find the correct words). So I'm going to use a word coined by my younger brother - Omniflage, to mean when that all encompassing feeling when you feel odd or weird, like something is wrong but don't know why or when something isn't wrong.

The main issue I have is, with religious Jewish family (not my immediate family, but grandparents, uncles and aunts etc. who I see regularly) as well as my friends being wholly ignorant when it comes to this kind of thing, it's hard to do something without being scared or freaked out that something bad will happen.

I guess I don't really know why I wrote this, which may contribute to why I have yet to express this externally. I'm aware this is entirely incoherent and probably not worth any kind of read, but for me this has already helped in terms of being highly therapeutic.

I'm biologically female, as long as it's just a short mention and then on to another topic. It also doesn't bother me as much when I'm called cute without being compared to any archetype of cute, where the subtext is left up to interpretation. That way, I can at least pretend it's a more gender-neutral or even masculine form of cute.

The thing that really gets to me is when conversation focuses on my cuteness for too long, etc. etc. Anyway, after a point it starts sounding less like compliments and more like mean-spirited teasing. Worse yet, these comparisons remind me of all of the things I like least about my body, all of the things I desperately wish I could change.

Last night I actually ended up leaving a gathering of friend--all but in a huff--because I felt so insulted and humiliated. At the time, or, at worst, participating in some light-hearted teasing.

Seriously? That's kickass! Where could I read more about that?

Since your question involved genderqueer spiritual and shamanic practices

Start by looking up ""[two spirits](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-Spirit)""... people who were formerly known as *berdaches*, allowing them to walk in many different social roles with ease, which in turn makes them very powerful shamans. 

There are several different varieties of two spirit traditions, have a creation myth that features four genders: male, female, *alyha*, and *hwame*. The Lakota have the *winkte*, and the Navaho have the *nadleeh*. The Navaho actually recognize five genders, similar to the Bugis

If you're interested in two spirits

* [Two-Spirit People: Native American Gender Identity

* [Becoming Two-Spirit: Gay Identity and Social Acceptance in Indian Country](http://www.amazon.com/Becoming-Two-Spirit-Identity-Acceptance-Country/dp/0803271263/ref=pd_sim_b_5)

* [Changing Ones: Third and Fourth Genders in Native North America](http://www.amazon.com/Changing-Ones-Fourth-Genders-America/dp/0312224796/ref=pd_bxgy_b_text_y)

(I own the first two

Even though ""Two Spirits"" are something of a Native American phenomenon, the *sekrata* are considered to have significant spiritual protection. In Siberia, many Chuckchi shamans are what we would call genderqueer.

In southern Indonesia, *calabai*, *calalai*, and *bissu*. *Calabai* and *calalai* are what we would recognize as MTF or FTM transgender people, respectively. Meanwhile *bissu* exhibit all five genders as a single, harmonious unit, what we'd call genderqueer or bi gender. The advice of a *bissu* is usually sought when a Bugi has deep spiritual questions or is about to undertake a pilgrimage. 

In Bugi society, the clothing, the makeup, the catering, preparing the venue, and running the reception.

[Here's the wiki article about Bugis and gender.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bissu#Bissu)

Similarly, the term *mashoga* has also become accepted as the Swahili word for ""gay.""

In the Dominican Republic, coming to accept them as a third gender entirely. [Here's another link about guevedoces, though it's NSFW.](http://www.usrf.org/news/010308-guevedoces.html ""NSFW, link provided as an anthropological resource."")

A little further south, the *quariwarmi* were genderqueer shamans of the dual-gendered Incan deity, *chuqui chinchay*. 

Perhaps the most well-known modern group would likely be the [hijra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijra_(South_Asia)) of India or the [kathoeys](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathoey) of Thailand. To my knowledge

My wife is trying to be understanding, because this men's underwear, to her, felt and fitted the same as what I'd been wearing - I think she thought I could wear it and be happy, and all this would be over.

I thanked her and picked it up, but no crushing feelings either.  We even made some jokes about her getting some just like it in her size if she thought it was so nice to wear.  Then she invited me to finish getting dressed and come downstairs to watch TV with the family.  She cheerily led the way, so pleased with herself for coming up with this clever fix for what was wrong.  I lagged behind, as the moment I thought of leaving the room wearing these I felt my legs go weak and I had to lean on the bed to keep from falling down.

I didn't collapse on the upstairs landing like the last time I tried to wear men's underwear, even to something on the TV show where I was supposed to laugh, with a stomach twisting in knots and every muscle in my body so tight she could feel me shaking.

I excused myself, trying to make my breathing work properly again.

After a little while she came up and held me - worried about me, at the moment, I felt like she would rather I was 'normal' than happy.  The feeling passed as she held me, and things felt much better that night.

That was two days ago.  Yesterday she was distant, she was almost surly.  When I got her to talk, she said she didn't want to talk about this, she just wanted it to go away.  She told me about how when she was a little girl her mother got mad at her and ripped apart a pretty dress she just got that she really liked to wear, ripped it apart in front of her and splattered it with bacon grease - and how my wife wanted to do that to my new underwear, and hated feeling that way.

I passed her in the front room a few minutes later, ""You're wearing them, aren't you?""

I shouted at her ""NO I'M WEARING THE GODDAMN UNDERWEAR I'M SUPPOSED TO!!"" - pulled open my pants and showed her the white men's cotton briefs I'd worn all my life except for the past week and a half.  I was shaking so bad I could barely stand

It felt like it was going to be a fight, I'm not doing anything wrong - she even tells me how much she loves the other changes I've been motivated to make, the way I care about my appearance at work, that I'm wearing my contacts so she can see my eyes, that I'm trying so much harder to connect with her.

She tells me she's not used to seeing me as a ""shriveled, since she won't have to see it...so it's OK as long as I hide it from her so she doesn't have to think about it.  She tells me that she thinks that part of what's hurting me is shame about what I'm doing, but I don't have to worry as she won't tell anyone.

I went upstairs to change

She was distant and short with me on the drive - it's only a minute or two, or mad that I can have something besides her make me happy - and frustrated that she hasn't made me happy in the first place.

I'm seeing my doctor to get counseling for me the day after tomorrow.  I'm going to keep encouraging her to get counseling for herself

Basically I've been having tons and tons of mixed feelings about who I really am. When I was very young

I've spent long long nights thinking about it specifically and now I just really don't know what I actually want. On one hand I find everything to do with being female interesting and feeling as if that's what I want, and I make up a different past to explain my own side of things like some sort of compulsive liar, though I just really don't want to be a guy. I'm not trying to get ANYTHING from them besides them believing I am really a cisgendered woman.

And then on the other I hand I pulled myself out of depression from ""not being"" a female and was completely fine with being a male.

But I still can't help but thinking

It's all very confusing to me and I feel like there's two me's. One that's female and one that's male.

The only thing I am absolutely certain about my sexuality and gender identity though is that I'm pansexual

If anything I GUESS I would choose to identify as genderqueer or possibly bi-gender

It's probably easiest to just say the definite facts. I'm a bisexual male

But mentally

I'm starting to come to terms with the fact that I *have* such thing as a personality.

I could say that it's starting to become clear to me that I have kind of a division between what I physically am

People probably say that I'm roleplaying or something. I think that's incorrect.

I am a *narrator figure.*

The biggest revelations I've had lately have all had to do with the fact that I'm a writer

And authors are supposed to distance themselves from the works. Good stories stand on their own. Solid facts stand on their own. But that is not how tales are told. People, even when that's completely irrelevant as far as the story goes.

Which is why I become a narrator of some description.

This is so deeply ingrained in my personality that I can't shake it. I take the garbs of a narrator to make my way through a situation in life. I *become* the narrator. I find it easier to tell some kinds of tales by being a guy. I find it easier to tell some kinds of tales by being a gals. And people may have their expectations of some tales being told by men or women

And mind you

And I feel comfort *being* these narrator figures. I feel comfort in building these storyteller agents. And yes, much the same way I put my soul in my characters and narrator figures. These fictional folks *are* me. They're my lenses for seeing the world in thousands of ways.

I now realise what exactly I meant when I realised, but *something* little that may remind people who wrote this crud.

The key word here is ""comfort""

This is all becoming clearer now. I was once thinking that it was just my online identity having a bit of gender confusion going on

I used to think it's completely irrelevant who I am

Anyways.. until recently I never really questioned anything. But then the landslide started. I'm 28, conventional gender roles and everything that comes with that were strictly enforced throughout my childhood.. and yet, ironically, I think he secretly wanted a son (but instead got two girls).. it was a very confusing upbringing, to say the least.

Anywhoo.. I continued to live in denial-land for the sake of my own sanity at the time. But I've always felt weird.. or, stuff like that. But I tried to be 'one of the girls' since that was expected of me.. but it never really worked out. It always weirded me out trying to be ‘feminine’, and overly girly clothes made me uncomfortable, and just wound up making me feel “hyper-sexualized” in a way. 

Whenever I showed any curiosity about sexuality and gender it was also swiftly and harshly dealt with, both at home and at school. I didn’t fit anywhere.. 

Fast forward a few years, or that I might be trans gender? I honestly have no idea.. this is all new and unexplored territory, and I've been spending a lot of time reading pretty much anything I can come across about these things. If they apply to me, how I feel about it (how I feel at all). 

And ofc whenever I start to think seriously about these things, and just *knowing* more certainly. And I keep thinking about the girly things I actually do like.. but do I have girly-sides to me because I’m gender fluid, or simply because I am physically a girl. Hormones and shit.. Why should it bother me that I have girly sides? Aren’t I a girl after all? 

I don’t know.. I don’t really have any gender dysphoria going on either.. much.. I think.. I might have a bit of an issue with my boobs. And strangely I’ve been feeling so much better after I shaved parts of my head. I now have a sort of dreads-sidecuts thing going on.. it doesn’t look very feminine tho
I don’t think I have any desire for a gender change, and I’ve found it reassuring to hear).

For example, it just means you were born with two X chromosome and a vagina, and thus, your sex is female. A manly, manly female.

Furthermore, an intersex man is a man, and so on.

Basically, for ease of communication, especially with doctors and nurses who need to check a box on a clipboard for your care, or perhaps if you're sexually interested in someone but only attracted to one sex, rather than gender, so they want to know what's going on down there before things get serious.

The obvious fact that your genitals and chromosomes aren't the business of people who have no business knowing about them is still true. I've heard a lot of people strongly disagree against this idea of female and male being words for sex rather than gender.

I am 21, I have become more and more uncomfortable with a strictly male identity, and have gone back and forth about it a lot. Last year I took a more gender neutral name with my friends and was open to them about being genderqueer. Having an awesome and diverse social circle, they were more than supportive. However, after 6 months or so I reverted back to my birth name, partially because of criticism from various family's members (who don't know anything about my gender identity, but had heard about the name change and expressed their dislike of it). The other reason was that I was starting to feel more secure about a male identity (though I qualified it by adding ""gender variant"" in front of it) and thought I could be okay with it again. 

Things don't magically work like that though. I've been through a lot lately, it's nothing that people don't just attribute to me being gay. I dont want to change how I dress just to conform to social ideas of ""feminine"", and I guess its more of a body thing for me. I'm fairly tall and deep voiced, both if which I dislike, and more than that I simply don't have a feminine body type at all. I struggle a lot with my body image, and while I would never get gender reassignment survey (I'm happy with what is between my legs) I sometimes have such strong body dysphoria I feel suicidal. Though my parents are very accepting of my presented orientation, they seem much more ambivalent about when it comes to atypical gender presentation/identity

So there's the long word dump I apologized for, does anyone have any advice on how to embrace/express a more androgynous identity besides changing how I dress? Third, how can I address this when it comes to relationships?  I am afraid of getting into relationships because I don't want someone to fall for for me only identifying me as male. I want them to understand and accept my non-binary identity and feel attracted to it - I don't want to just have a gay boyfriend who sees me as an effeminate male. Am I over-thinking that, or am I justified feeling like it really matters?

Recently, as well as to more form-fitting clothing. I'm also wearing basic makeup almost daily, which is sort of new and daunting to me. Nobody at school or home seems to care or react much, although I've been getting more people saying ""you look nice/pretty today!"", which I honestly have no idea how to react to other than a quick thanks and an uncomfortable smile.

I'm not sure *why* exactly I've felt inclined to present myself this way, and so dresses and skirts come with tights and sleeves. I'm not comfortable with my legs or pits shaved, but I'm also not confident enough to have two ""clashing"" aspects of my gender identity expressed together in public (*someday, fuzzy legs and a summer dress!*). I honestly wish I could shapeshift my body whenever I felt a special inclination to whatever part of me I wanted to express the most on the outside. I could have shoulder length hair and lovely curves one day, and then the next just cut it all off and have a flat chest and be five inches taller. Alas, that isn't how it works.

Granted, so thanks for reading :)

So I'm genderqueer, and some teachers and staff are starting to do so as well.
What can I do to make my boyfriend more comfortable with this aspect of transitioning?

So I am a 26 year old female.  I have been interested in girls since I was about 7
As I went through puberty I knew I liked guys too.  I was certain I liked males but I wasn't positive about females although I could not stop fantasizing about them, and realized I was most certainly bi-sexual, but I am still nervous as hell around women I am attracted to and it has greatly impeded my self confidence in even beginning to try out a real relationship with one.  Until the last two years, being in a heterosexual relationship with someone whos sex drive is MUCH lower than mine, I have spent a lot of time experimenting with myself, him, and my feelings about sexuality.  I remember being very attracted to cross dressers and (edited) transsexuals when I used to go to gay bars back in Canada (I live in the USA now), I still fantasize about being with women as a man with a penis, but I feel so flexible now.  I have always been the submissive one, and did boy things.  99% of my friends are still all guys

This morning I imagined another person's voice coming out of my mouth and almost started crying. It wasn't anyone that I knew. I just invented the sound.

I thought it would be interesting to imagine a feminine twist to my words.

Last night

I was Moosejaw

And it was right.

I traded the bass off, after explaining how the controller worked, (and selecting Easy without him noticing until afterwards). I came back after a few songs and asked if anyone was getting bored.

""Not really

Not right then

I said

When I was a child, even if it was based off of faulty premises. ""I think I'm probably actually a girl. But I like girls. I think I like girls [I like being normal] more than I'd like being a girl. But I think you can have both? I think that's called being a lesbian. I guess I'm a lesbian, then.""

I never thought you could like both, or neither, or either, or another. It never occurred to me that sometimes I didn't feel that way - that I was normal, at times. I thought the gender binary and your preferences were set in stone. I didn't always think much of it, and I didn't often think much of myself after that afternoon. I knew what people though of lesbians. I wasn't able to speak my mind of the issue. There would be problems.

It never even occurred to me that people wouldn't believe me when I say I am what I'm not. Perfect childhood reasoning

I always loved things that were split in half. A childhood, half in the other's - both piecemeal and [not](http://i.imgur.com/75P1Q.jpg). Drag queens, when I learned about them.

And the people that had more courage than I did.

I like all clothes. I know I'm missing a couple important parts and have a bit of a disproportionate body to be able to use most of the options

Once, at the cost of most anything. Then I learned eunuchs aren't ambiguous, they're just eunuchs. And I was poor anyway.

And my parents would disagree

Recovery through therapy is more important than completion. And I wouldn't even get that

Some days I wonder what I am

**The Growing Use of Mx as a Gender-inclusive Title in the UK** - Version 1.8 - 2013-08-16

Mx was created as a standard title without convey gender connotations, Mx. It doesn't require a qualification or career as Dr and Rev do. The x represents a wildcard character that removes gender. The title is pronounced Mux or Mix.

Example: Mx Sam Smith.

The following pages provide evidence of well-known companies and organisations accepting and offering Mx as a gender-inclusive title at the time of writing. The earliest example of a major company accepting Mx in this document is by the Post Office in October 2009.

Yesterday I got out of bed before dawn because I couldn't stay there any more and listen to the roiling chatter in my head, and I had to try something.  The rest of the day was grey emotional turmoil, but it was at least bearable, if scary.  The monsters were there, but a little farther away.

I love long hair. I recently cut it off

I always thought that once I moved out and got into college, and the money from the casinos go to my people). I'm thinking about asking my mother if we can buy guy clothes for me this time around. Then I can switch between girl and guy clothing whenever I feel like it without any issues. 

I don't know if this is a wise decision, but I don't know how they'd feel about a whole wardrobe or if they'd even permit it. They also are not aware that I am any sort of GSM, they are under the impression that I am simply a very strong ally. I'm not sure I want them to know, and I'm afraid that if I tell them I want to buy male clothing they'll think I'm simply trying to upset this conservative town rather than trying to be comfortable with myself and my gender identity. 

Also, and I'm not sure how everyone else in my world would take it. And my extended family would probably be disgusted with me.

I am MAAB in my mid-twenties. I have an invisible physical disability that affects my motor control on my right side. It limits me in certain ways, but it’s gotten worse in recent months. I know what my hobbies are. I know what my skills are, and I know what my personality is like. Everything else is negotiable. 

I have a disconnect with my body. I’m not sure what term can describe it. I have trouble recognizing or reconciling myself in images and videos of me. When I go to the bathroom mirror, I’ve thought about why I can’t just change my shape with just a snap of my fingers. The only times that I feel less awkward in that sense is when I have some sort of face covering: mostly masks and helmets.

I don’t like the feeling of being limited in the physical aspect of who I am. I don’t get tattoos for that reason. While I enjoy seeing them on others, and still feel that alienation.

I’m a costumer/cosplayer.  I’m part of a charity group that raises money or helps others through costuming, and a few times in the papers. Becoming someone else is old hat to me. I mentioned helmets and masks before: when I can’t recognize my usual self in the mirror or photos, I’m happier.

The onset of actual self-exploration came rather late to me – I was so busy with high school and university

One thing that kind of shocked me (and I’m still getting over) is that I’m probably asexual. The absence of any sexual desire at all meant that I had no ‘what I want’ axis to counterpoint the ‘who I am’ in some sort of human graph. Made it harder to steer

About eight months ago I was introduced to the concept of genderqueer and fluid identity. At the time

I should have taken to the signals of having no expectation for my body. Three months ago (which gives you an idea of how long I’ve been lurking) I came across [this thread]( http://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/108alt/gender_roles_vs_gender_identity/) and the commenters (Ray in particular) made something resonate so loudly I could swear that I heard a tuning fork. I’ve done a great deal of pondering since then.

A little list of events that have poked at me about all this in the past couple years:


* In early 2011, to the chagrin of relatives. At its longest, the back and back/sides could touch the collar of a t-shirt.

* I’m happier in the mirror with long hair

* While having long hair

* Being underemployed, though, as long as it’s tied back. I seriously questioned the logic in the distinction.

* I got my hair cut by a new person this fall, I realized that it looked more feminine to me than my long hair. Seriously questioned myself on why it mattered.

* More and more

* I live in a very LGBT friendly city. One local geek hangout I like had two ladies’ nights that appealed to me

* For Christmas 2012, perfectly wrapped so that none of it was showing but the paper was a second skin. My family got a kick out of it, and brought it to the dinner table for Christmas dinner and put it next to me, calling it by the female version of my name. You have no idea how strange it felt, considering they are rather conservative.

A bit of my verdict from these events and thought: I don’t think I have a gender identity. I don’t really have an urge to strive for androgyny, depending on my mood, like it were a red or blue shirt. 

Being a costumer/improvisation person, voices, you name it. But we all know costumes and cosplay isn’t real. I know they aren’t. The problem with experimenting with gender expression in the everyday for me is that as a (possible?) agender, is that it’s ‘fake’ – even to me. My current expression, as close as it is to my birth gender already, still feels like it’s put on. I think I lack the confidence to present the way I want because I don’t see it as being ‘me’, just ‘me today.’ 

I don’t want others to see this gender apathy as me playing games, and employers would think about me, but I definitely don’t want others to think I’m a fraud for wanting to do whatever I feel like – even if it’s nothing out of the ordinary and call myself genderqueer. My family would definitely be the biggest hurdle, of course.

There are several LGBTQ locations (and a gay village) in my city, all eyes are going to be on me and even if I cut things off it could all come back to bite me. I’m financially vulnerable and a misstep could hurt me hard.

EDIT: Just wanted to add, either.

Does anyone have advice for this rambler? I have no idea how to proceed. ‘Coming out’ – if that’s what I should call it – would be hard even to my LGBTQ friends. Just pressing this submit button is a huge deal for me.

So, I like my dick, I like everything about being a man. I don't have any desire to transition permanently, and I don't feel at all like I'm trapped in my own body - it's not really to do with visual identity, it feels more sexual.

I do like to cross dress - it started out with shoes, girly is the term I use, where I want to act like a girl, dress like a girl, be seen as sexy. I have a girlfriend, who I love a hell of a lot, and she knows I like to dress up. I've found myself wanted to be fucked, but not with a man - just with her, but it's lessening every day.

When I was little, from wanting to be a princess to wanting to be the prince that saved her.  I remember asking my mom what happened when two boys or two girls married each other.  I remember wanting to have a penis and boobs, I remember fantasizing about it.

It went to the wayside as I got older. I gained weight, cargo pants and shirts and cuffs and chains, then I got too big to wear cargo pants comfortably and gave in and started wearing women's jeans.  

I started writing gay characters, I think about what it would be like to be in a gay relationship, and two summers ago I discovered the term girlfag.  A girl that identifies as a gay male.  That made so much sense to me.  I'd only ever had one boyfriend, and he lasted all of three weeks.  It was probably a good thing it didn't last longer, really.  

Last summer I broke down and went to the doc for anxiety meds, lips, and tongue), and the skin around my nails.  I got medicine, but refused to get a therapist, then I stopped taking the meds altogether because if I keep taking them then I would have to go to a therapist, which scares the hell out of me for some reason I can't quite define.  

I found genderqueer a few months ago and realized that defines me pretty well.  I like my long hair and sometimes my boobs

Then a couple weeks ago I got a new toy and decided to try it out and pulled up a video from r/gayporn.  Then I started crying, and I'm telling myself to wait until I've lost the weight I want to lose before making any decisions, and now here I am rambling on to you guys.

I am a 29 year old guy

Quick back story, but thinking about it more I clearly remember wanting to always wear womens underwear, always wanted to go to sleep in them and wake up in the morning wearing them instead of boxers, but was terrified that my Mum or Dad would pop their head in at night to check on me and see, if the covers had fallen off or something. 

I joined the army when I was 19 and didnt really crossdress at all for years, then when I was 26 I left the forces, met my wife and got married, had kids etc, I told my wife all about this, and she encouraged it, still does, not INSPITE of who I am, we go out shopping together for clothes, grown my hair long and started going to work in a ponytail

Not related to my gender confusedness, talking to them on good ol' AOL chat when I was younger and arranging to meet up but then bottling it, I joined the army when I was 19 and spent much of my early 20's in the following cycle on nights out every weekend, go out with friends and get drunk, slink off to a nearby gay bar and hang around outside scared to go in in-case I knew anyone in there, go back home and immediately get on webcams for guys, arrange to meet up, rinse and repeat.

I've always been painfully shy, with a lot of help from my wife, I recently went for a day out to a farm with my little girl, wearing some skinny jeans, a long, blatantly womens, cardigan and my hair tied back and put in some plaits, i really feel like I'm finding myself

In a perfect world I'd have a smooth stubble free face, and for a while I thought I was (going on depression meds after imagining killing myself on the commute most mornings, and getting lost staring into a mirror thinking about stabbing my adams apple with some tweezers!), but I don't think I feel like a woman! :( and transition is also something I don't know if I could ever go through with, unless I was holding a gun to my head every night, but that won't happen as I am not desperately unhappy as a guy, and I get butterflies in my stomach just thinking about coming out into the open with all that and being out there for friends and family to disown and the world to laugh and stare at as I pass in the street.

I kinda wish there was a button that I could press where I wake up as a woman tomorrow

For a long time I wondered if I wanted to be a man, but don't want to try and become one, even though there are some things about being female that distress me. So, I don't know, am I genderqueer? Am I in the right place? (sorry if not!) If I don't identify as some non-binary gender, will I never be able to do anything about my dysphoria?

Anyway

I do, if you do, how you work that out theologically, philosophically, scripturally, and in practice.

As for myself, and I know that I always arrive at a few key issues in trying to intersect my gender identity with my faith.

Of course, and thereby not a necessary part of the new covenant in Christ.  There are some exegetical problems with writing things like that off, but that's one I can let slide.

Nonetheless

Furthermore, that the writers of the new testament would have thrown intentional cross-gender or non-gender expression into the general lump of ""sexual immorality"" that they are more or less always declaring as belonging only to the realm of behaviors which are sinful.

Thus, especially those which are aesthetic, in a high regard.

On the other hand, Paul states that ""now that all are in Christ"" there are no distinctions of race, class, or gender.  So maybe gender-neutral or cross gender expression is ""permissible, but not beneficial""?

Furthermore

It seems to me that one can evaluate cross-gender or gender neutral desires as 1) fundamentally a part of how God has created certain beings like myself (as more liberal theologians would be likely to say) 2) a ""natural"", in iniquity I was brought forth"" or 3) a psychological distortion which is the result of perhaps some abberant behavior at a point in my life, which is as such sinful and to be eradicated.

Somewhat obviously, ties, nail-polish, cologne and makeup that come with it.  Nonetheless, I feel like I'm always holding these ideas in tension as a gender neutral person and a Christian.

Are there any others of you who hold to the faith and similarly try to express a state of gender-ambiguity?  What is your perspective on these matters?",,t5_2r1c3,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/1dj5bp/just_out_of_curiousity/
1367030210.0,1d71u1,Can anyone relate?,purplelirpa,8,1,9,"I guess I'm not really sure where to start

Before puberty, and was fairly hypersexual at a young age. I do remember wanting to be able to ""pee standing up, because the ninja turtles did,"" and tried many times to try to be like a boy. But I don't remember wanting a penis or anything like that. Even still, I'm not all that concerned with removing my genitalia, they bring me a lot of pleasure.

Now that I am an adult, it makes me upset. When someone says about me that I'm ""being just like a girl,"" I get upset. I feel like I am more proud when someone says something I am doing is masculine, but I don't really go out of my way to try to be masculine, I just feel that typical feminine traits like wearing make up and dressing up are stupid and a waste of my time. 

There have been times when I have wanted to not have boobs, but I don't want to change them for fear of losing sensitivity.

I feel really mixed up, I just want people to see me for my mind and personality, and value that. Some days I don't even feel human. I feel a lot of disgust when people are attracted to my figure.
