It all looked great, when they came across the Public Event, and joined it with other players... that just blew me away.

Now, but I think this will be a great game dynamic. It hit me with a sense of nostalgia, thinking about how I met those I'm closest to on Xbox Live, in Halo 2/3 matchmaking. Imagine traversing the vast landscapes with your friends, in (what seemed to be) such a ""natural"" environment - for lack of a better term - then all of a sudden, *something* happens out of the blue. You and your friends decide to engage in battle/investigation, and just like in the footage

This is going to be such a good way of meeting people, there's that chance that *something* will happen, and you might meet some great people.

Think of how much skills and experience you could amass on one single character in a decade

I also like the idea that bringing my past character forward to the next Destiny game will also bring my customised armour and weapons with me, then 4 and so on. 

I really hope you get some in-depth character interactions I.E. if you have had a character since Destiny and then in 'Destiny 3' NPC's will react saying how helpful you've been over the years and how much you've done for the race (or even make a nice reference to total recall if you are a Titan).

If I plant a seed on that first day, through weak weapons and sucky magic in our lower levels, can we conquer and become the largest guild; with your help brothers and sisters I believe so. 

Let us spread through the galaxy and retake what should rightfully be humanities

Tl;dr: Do you think Bungie will give us a really in-depth experience to make running the same character extremely appealing? Like in Mass Effect when you pull a character through.

1371656504.0,1gnsnd,Vanguard is not a class.,MightyFifi,56,8,50,"To begin my case I would like to start by sharing the current definition of the word *vanguard*. This will be the foundation of my argument.

Noun

1. A group of people leading the way in new developments or ideas.
2. A position at the forefront of new developments or ideas: ""in the vanguard of technical development"".

IMO, this simply isn't the case. In fact, the word vanguard is closer to something of a scout. 

Bungie has never alluded to *The Vanguard* being a class. Every time they have used the term it has been where there is missing information using this line:

""Awaiting reports from the Vanguard""

The Vanguard is much more likely a group, the group of people who are in the outskirts of the current human domain. Finding information on the lost planets of humanity and perhaps reaching further outside of our solar system. 

I would make the argument that *The Vanguard* are something of the converse of *The Guardians*.

We as *Guardians* are charged with the task of defending the final city of human kind. Comprised of Hunters

The *Vanguard* are charged with the task of finding out what happened with the rest of humanity. Likely also comprised of Hunters

There are three classes. There will likely continue to be three classes. Not saying that Bungie will not ever release any other classes

4 is a poor number when compared to the [power of the number 3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3_\(number\)).

I know that this question will not be put to rest until we hear something official from Bungie or when Destiny is released. I'm just under the allusion that believing *The Vanguard* is another class is simply wishful thinking.

**Which is perfectly fine!** Particularly because all I really want is a sword for my Warlock. ",self,t5_2vq0w,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1gnsnd/vanguard_is_not_a_class/

FAQ

What is Destiny?

* Destiny is an open world first-person shooter set 700 years in the future in a post-apocalyptic world after an event known as the Collapse, as they try to protect the last city on Earth. Above the city hovers the Traveler, a white, spherical, celestial body that saved humanity from the Collapse, and grants the Guardians unknown powers as they venture out into the solar system once more. But hostile alien races have occupied mankind's former colonies, and so the player is tasked with finding and destroying these threats before humanity is wiped out...for good.

What kind of game is Destiny?

* A new genre Bungie calls a ""shared-world shooter."" Expect a co-operative first person shooter that automatically matchmakes a few players in the area into your game so a small party will be assembled seamlessly into the fight.

* At least three: [Titan

Will there be character customization?

Who are the enemies?

* Yes. The [Pike](http://www.bungie.net/pubassets/615/pike_desktop.jpg) and the [Spider Tank](http://www.bungie.net/pubassets/615/fallen_desktop.jpg) are in released concept art.

What are the game environments?

* Environments scattered across our former colonies on Venus

* Optional expanded text: We know of the Black Garden, the swamps of Old Chicago, the Tower, the Reef, giant obsidian pyramid ships, the Hellmouth on the Moon, the Exclusion Zone of Mars, the Shores of Time and the Citadel on Venus.

        Am I missing any? Is the Moon known as ""Luna"" or simply ""the Moon"" in the Destiny universe? Also would the community like an expanded answer about all known locations

Do I get to actually fly to other planets

* Unknown.

Will there be competitive multiplayer?

Who is working on the soundtrack for the game?

We all know that Bungie has acknowledged the existence of the Vanguards, that the Vanguard is not a class).

We also have a solid understanding of the factions that will be available to us.

So, did we instantly assume it was related to one of the subjects we already knew about?  The odds of that, in the enormous, largely unrevealed Destiny universe, are quite small.

So who are the Vanguards?  

They could be you.  They could be me.  They're the beta testers.

I'm curious to know what everyone thinks about Bungie shooting for a Teen rating on Destiny. I know that this has been neither confirmed nor denied by Bungie

Let's look at Halo 1: Bungie was shooting for a T rating from the MSRB

One obvious concern of mine is that the Teen rating (assuming that the rumors are true) means that things will have to be dumbed down. I have noticed (speaking generally, I realize that this is not true of all games. Look at KOTOR - Garnered a Teen rating and it's been hailed as one of the best games of all time. The Uncharted franchise - Also Teen, and it's bloody fantastic. The bar for good Teen games has been set pretty high, so my expectations are high. 

I will be buying this game day one, set in a persistent ten year world.

If there is some actual new info out there go ahead and post it but the amount of repost seen here is crazy and just plain ol outlandish.

The speculation and ideas in this sub are great but some of the speculation questions just seem to make little to no sense 70% of the time because it'll be a question like ""what made the vex and why do they do what they do?""

Now I don't want to sound negative all through this post so I would like to mention that some of the people in this sub are finally starting to point out to others about reposted info as well as pointing out old info mistaken as new info and that's great! Also

TL:DR: repost are getting pretty crazy for such a small sub. Don't ask things that cannot be currently answered. Seeing original and creative post are amazing compared to old news.

edit 2: Ok

1.  The original Halo MMO that was being designed by Ensemble Studios was code named ‘Titan.’  Also

2.  In February 2007, Halo was featured in the show!  So Blizzard was advertising for Halo in 2007?  This was right before word got out that Blizzard was working on a brand new MMO and they started hiring “Science-Fiction Texture Artists.”  Coincidence? Maybe.

3.  As we know Bungie and Activision (now Activision-Blizzard) are in a 10 year partnership and some terms of the agreement were not disclosed.  Coincidence? Maybe.

4.  Jeff Kaplan, post-apocalyptic, or historical?”  Now, all of the above would definitely apply to Halo.  Coincidence? Maybe

1367801407.0,1drh3p,Focus on Osiris,NinjaMaticDIPC,25,1,13,"Osiris is many things to many people, was the catalyst) . For the sake of this article I’ll just go ahead and focus on the first two. There is, or a feel for what is coming down the pipes. Look at it this way; if I’m way off on this we’ll all have learned some random facts that will invariably resurface in 20 years when we’re all old and watching reruns of Jeopardy.

For starters I’ll go to the beginning of where this all started for me. We had only just learned that there were five factions, and Osiris looked unfinished. It just looked coarse compared to the stylized logos of the other four. While I stared I wondered if the eye had anything to do with Osiris and punched it in on Wikipedia, that’s where I got interested. There is an eye glyph in hieroglyph that represents Osiris, it can be used in relation to vision, or “to do”, or “to make”. That didn't really jump out at me but the image of Osiris cried out. 

His skin color was similar to that of the Awoken. If you Google images of Osiris you’ll find a whole host of pictures which depict him in a whole variety of greens, was betrayed by his brother (Set) who killed him. Isis brought Osiris back to life long enough to conceive his child, the magic wore off and he turned into a pumpk... died again. There are a couple of different accounts that describe when Osiris was dismembered and strewn about the desert, but it’s universally told that he got hacked up, and his “phallus” was lost or eaten by a fish... then eventually replaced by a golden one when he was reassembled (if you've got it, flaunt it!). So now Isis has gone and put together a Franken-deity, and all of the other gods figure she’s put in the effort the least they could do is resurrect Osiris one more time. They went one step further this time, and the after life... and resurrection (I guess they figured that it would be easier if he could just do it himself from now on). Osiris’ son was Horus. Horus and Isis avenged Osiris and killed Set.

Okay, as god of resurrection, was very much an agricultural god and was linked to the growing cycles, as well as the burial rights that would assure a Pharaoh’s passage into the underworld (which was thought to be in the west). When he was depicted in paintings associated with rebirth or resurrection he was green, and black for death (and fertility referring to the nutrient rich, dark soil along the Nile). My first thought was that the Awoken must be somehow associated with Osiris (the faction). Originally because of the similarity in color, and then as I thought about it I thought there was also a similarity in implications between the terms Awoken and Resurrected.

The next piece of the puzzle that caught my eye was in the mail sac titled “When You Wish Upon A Mail Sac”. About a quarter of the way down the page I read a question that grabbed my attention.

""Player3Thomas: Would you please name a NPC after me?

DeeJ: Only if you change your name to Osiris. Or

I don’t know about you

There’s one more thing I’d like to look at before I wrap this all up. It doesn't necessarily have to do with Osiris, and it’s everything I want out of a science-fantasy world. Something that looks cool, magical, and high tech all at the same time. 

It’s the image of Onyx Pyramid ships rising through what look to be clouds that are floating in space around a planet. In that same mail sac I mentioned before there had been a question about what was their favorite sky box in the game. A couple of the locations had been [redacted], while I was looking at the concept art I finally made the connection. Egypt. There is a faction and an NPC named after and Egyptian god, and there are giant Pyramid space ships. I thought the connection was good enough to look a little deeper, and began to look into any connections Osiris may have with a planet. And you'll never guess what I found.

This is where Egyptian mythology gets a bit disjointed. There are different accounts of the Osiris Myth. I won’t get into all of them but one source I found mentioned two opinions. One considered “Typhon to be the solar world and Osiris to be the lunar world”, has physical union with Isis, as the moon”. Okay, okay, who the hell is Typhon? I’ll quote a block from Wikipedia... it’s just easier that way.

""Diodorus Siculus gives another version of the myth in which Osiris was described as an ancient king who taught the Egyptians the arts of civilization, the satyrs, and the nine muses, before finally returning to Egypt. Osiris was then murdered by his evil brother Typhon, who was identified with Set. Typhon divided the body into twenty six pieces, which he distributed amongst his fellow conspirators in order to implicate them in the murder. Isis and Horus avenged the death of Osiris and slew Typhon. Isis recovered all the parts of Osiris’ body, except the phallus, which then became centres of Osiris worship”

That’s who Typhon is

The other connection I found was planet HD 209458, 2.5 times larger than Jupiter, and it’s a gas giant as well... sort of. It was the first of a new kind of planet discovered. It is losing its atmosphere, it’s literally evaporating off. From my understanding it is currently shedding hydrogen, and has an atmosphere that consists of Oxygen, Carbon, and water vapor. I geeked out on this pretty hard, but that picture of the planet surrounded by clouds in space resonates with me. Maybe they just put the clouds there because they look cool

So what do we get out of all of this? Perhaps a faint outline of what is being created. Osiris, watches over the dead, and the lands of the west. There’s a lot of good material to play with there... and that’s just one person, one faction, one race. As I've said, this is just speculation, but unless Bungie simply chose the name because it sounded good they don’t exactly have an abundance of Osiris’ to choose from.

I've been a long time fan of Bungie and their games. I remember playing Pathways Into Darkness on the Mac when I was a kid. Playing the Marathon games took up countless hours as I got older. I'm 29 now and I've watched Bungie go from small time to one of the biggest game studios. In high school I marveled at Halo when I heard Bungie was making it. I bought the Xbox just for that game. It turned out my passion for their games was well placed as the Halo franchise is now one of Microsoft's flagship titles. 

I created this account just for the opportunity to throw some of my work at the new Destiny IP which has captured my imagination and taken up my free time. I've been pegging away at different concept art for armors and weapons. I'd like to share them with you.

So I really really hope that Bungie implements a robust and highly specific player preference system to filter who and who doesn't get to jump into your campaign missions.


Here are some options I'd like to see:

- **Age**.  I'm an adult.  I do NOT want to play with children.  Let me filter out anyone under 18 please.

- **Experience**.  I have a full time job

- **Behavior**.  Has someone been reported for racist remarks

- **Play Style**.  If I want to be a nerd, and then have some stranger start asking me about who I think is going to the playoffs.

- **Connection**.  I will not tolerate lag during the campaign.  If someone has a crap connection, or if they drop from the game, don't just poof them out of my game - have AI take over their avatar until I'm done with my mission!

- **Timezone**.  If you're going to force me to hook up with random people.  Send me people from my own Timezone.  That way,,False,self,t5_2vq0w,False,,True

Personally:

Given what we know, but on a greater scale, and with greater depth and variety and customization. 

The question is, there's a few ways it might stand out. 

Firstly: by having a story and lore that's actually interesting. 

Secondly: by integrating a single player experience... maybe we'll get a single player campaign

Thirdly: by really embracing space battles

Fourthly: by embracing user-created content in some big way. Bungie have always been major advocates.

So, the response is very positive.  The people who have been praising the game are keeping in mind that the demo we saw was in fact that, a demo.  Nothing more.  Plus, supposedly the demo was built specifically for E3.

The people who have been on the more negative side of the game seem to think that what we saw at E3 is going to represent the entire game, is crazy.

What we saw at E3 is exactly what I expected to see, max level PvP or raids with all the crazy guns, you were out of your mind.  Destiny is still, I'm going to guess, a year away from release, the game is in pre-alpha still.  For all we know, that kind of stuff isn't even done yet.

So to anyone who might still be on edge about Destiny, in a starter zone.  If you really think the rest of the game is going to be like that, I think you're crazy.

Now what I'm trying to do is reconcile unique armor and weapons with baseline competitiveness.  For armor this is pretty easy to speculate on: my first and only guess so far is that each piece of armor will have:

A) A model    
B) A color    
C) A visual effect (optional)    

Or 2 of the 3, but have it in a completely non-matching color.  But I imagine armor effects could be something like the flaming helmets in Reach and whatnot.

What I can't really wrap my head around is weapons.  If weapons are indeed like Borderlands, perhaps weapon color?

So with that being said we will most likely be getting a influx of people to this sub-reddit soon and having guidelines for posting (images

Also flair.

Because bitches love flair.

So lets use this thread as a way to get suggestions together for this sub-reddit to help the mods out!

List so far:

* Posting guidelines

* Flair

* add the IGN FAQ as a link to the side of this page or create a thread with in this sub-reddit that is a FAQ (Help make it so we don't see the same threads popping up everywhere)

* Try to keep it Meme free (some images are nice but try to keep it discussion based )

* Something like r/Halo

* my body is ready is an acceptable here as a meme

*  spot reserved on the sidebar for information

Slowly Updating this thread as more pop up guys!

**Here are some of the stand-out quotes:**

&gt; Activision Publishing boss Eric Hirshberg says it's not an MMO. No, ""we realised it belonged to a genre we couldn't quite pin down.""

&gt; ""We realised to refer to Destiny as any one of these pre-existing genres would almost be to undersell or under-promise what we think it could deliver to gamers

&gt; Hirshberg has coined a different phrase. He calls Destiny the ""world's first shared-world shooter"".

&gt; ""There's been a lot of rumours that we're working on an MMOFPS,"" Jason Jones, Bungie co-founder and Destiny project director, says. ""The truth is, if you enjoy first-person shooters and you play them on console, Destiny's going to be the best one you've ever played. That's our goal.

&gt; ""We've learned our lessons from MMOs. We've learned our lessons from Facebook games. But Destiny is a console first-person shooter. It's the kind of game we love to play and it's the game our fans love to play.""

&gt; This is a setting Bungie calls ""mythic science fiction""

What is Destiny?

* Destiny is an open world first-person shooter set 700 years in the future in a post-apocalyptic world after an event known as the Collapse, as they try to protect the last city on Earth. Above the city hovers the Traveler, a white, spherical, celestial body that saved humanity from the Collapse, and grants the Guardians unknown powers as they venture out into the solar system once more. But hostile alien races have occupied mankind's former colonies, and so the player is tasked with finding and destroying these threats before humanity is wiped out...for good.

What kind of game is Destiny?

* A new genre Bungie calls a ""shared-world shooter."" Expect a co-operative first person shooter that automatically matchmakes a few players in the area into your game so a small party will be assembled seamlessly into the fight. 

Is it an MMO?

* No. Mostly no anyways. For most of the gameplay there will only be a small party playing together–up to six as far as we know. However, and partying up. While this is very similar to aspects of MMOs, Bungie has been very explicit in defining it as the new genre of a 'share-world shooter,' not an MMO.

Who is the developer?

* [Bungie](http://www.bungie.net/)

Who is the publisher?

1372751772.0,1hhh4p,My Thoughts on the Leveling System,TheophilusOmega,11,1,9,"
**TL;DR: I theorize that Destiny will feature a raking system that represents player skill instead of experience.**

I'm not quite convinced that the leveling system in Destiny is going to follow the typical RPG system where you gather experience, repeat. This formula has been done in a thousand games, and specifically in shooters such as Borderlands, which is great fun but, Bungie is claiming to have something brand new. What if levels represent your skill level as opposed to your experience level as in Reach's Arena or ranked playlists in Halo 3. Bungie keeps pointing out that they will have a matchmaking system, which is something that measures skill and tries to make a fair fight between opponents, why waste such a system if levels only reflect your XP level? 

What I am thinking is that Bungie will say have a level 10 boss in a public event, another is level 10, one is 8, and the last 12, so the average is 10 versus 10. What is important to note is that the level 3 does just as much damage as the 17 and has an equal shot at killing the boss, but that 17 is simply a far more skilled player, so in all likelihood he will do the most for the team. 

If you notice at the Sony reveal the player is a level 7, but this does not seem to be the case. ",,False,self,t5_2vq0w,False,,

The darn things are nearly unreadable. There's just something about the typeface, column width, and color that makes it REALLY difficult to read. Does anyone else get this? Don't get me wrong, the content is always fantastic, but the way it's presented is VERY difficult to digest. I've included some examples to help demonstrate my point. 

First

- [Halo Era Breaking In - Readable](http://halo.bungie.net/News/content.aspx?type=topnews&amp;cid=16261)

- [Halo Era Weekly Update - Readable](http://halo.bungie.net/News/content.aspx?type=topnews&amp;link=BWU_121809)

Now

- [Destiny Era Breaking In - Unreadable](http://www.bungie.net/7_Breaking-In---Rajeev-Nattam/en-us/News/News?aid=10485)


- [Destiny Era Update - Less readable](http://www.bungie.net/7_New-Beginnings/en-us/News/News?aid=10308)

- [Destiny Era Mail Sack Update - Unreadable](http://www.bungie.net/7_Mail-Sack-Break/en-us/News/News?aid=10432)

Does anyone else see this, I like that the Q's and A's are well defined. In the Destiny updates, it's difficult to tell Q's from A's at a glance. In the Destiny era updates, the white font on gray background is the worst part. That, and the typeface. I have difficulty telling bold from standard.

&gt;""Now we’re saying, to the Destiny universe?” That meant a big exploration of mobile. I think they showed you the user-testing lab next door. The very first thing that was tested in that lab was mobile. We’ve made some big investments there, because we think that, as awesome as stats and groups and messaging and all those things are, we just think there is so much more there. When we’re building a universe that has so many more stories and so much more depth, there are too many stories to tell just inside of that.""

**Some questions:**

-  Do these ""Faction Wars"" involve humans killing humans?  And if so

-  What happens if one faction becomes too powerful?  Won't it ruin the game for the other factions?

-  Do ""Faction Wars"" pit guilds/clans against each other?  Or are there bigger factions that individual guilds/clans are part of?

-  Do these ""Faction Wars"" effect the single player campaign?

Are there areas in the game that players will return to after their adventures that aren't combat zones where trade or just general hanging out and interacting will occur? Is that expressly what the city formed around the Traveler is for? 

Bungie has discussed personalized ships and they seem to represent a player's ""home base"" from which to launch off into new places to find trouble. But what about those players that just want to feel connected to the world but aren't itching for combat for a few minutes?

""There is not one development studio that I can recall that has the heart, devotion, spirit and determination quite like yours, Bungie. You are the sole developer that I will buy just about any game from. When I plunge myself into the vast universes forged by your holy hands, I feel like I'm at home.

Ever since I first heard the iconic, cherished every waking day within the depths of my very soul and well being. I have even met the best friend I have ever had in my existence online through Halo 2, and to top it all off, he lived only minutes from my residence. Halo 3 and Halo: Reach brought so many new and wondrous opportunity with the Forge, Theater Mode and wide variety of custom game options that our friends and I would go for several hours, or even days, relishing in the staggering sensations enveloping around us. Halo ushered a glorious ten years of my life that I would never trade for anything in this realm we call our universe, 343 Industries

So what does all of this mean for Destiny? Why am I constantly dreaming of this new world in my sleep?

Destiny is driven by the interaction of people and the choices we all make that shape the way our experiences unfold before our very eyes. We will be traveling through the stars, determination and vigor in our hearts. If we can stop seven Halos from wiping out all life in the Milky Way galaxy, who knows what we can accomplish in Destiny?

I want to play Destiny because I wish to form new relationships with other players in this vast universe that I will soon, making countless new ones along the way and strengthening the community that shaped us from the very beginning.

It is my Destiny to play this game.""",self,t5_2vq0w,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1htcwt/if_you_guys_are_interested_in_hearing_my/

1. Characters. So From what I understand, or ninja (forgot what that one was called.) are there any other races and/or character types coming? Or are these the only options?
2. Weapon system. Is it like Borderlands? Borderlands system is *ok* because it works for Borderlands. But I don't see it working that well from what I've seen from Destiny. Like. In Borderlands. If you find a weapon at level 6. That gun is useless by level 12. You have to continually replace weapons. Personally I'm not a fan of that because some weapons I want to continue using through my levels. So could someone explain the system to me? 
3. Competitive. Is there a competitive mode? Like PvP/ 4v4 great competitive multiplayer like what we saw from Halo 2/3? Will it be ""Halo Style"" (Set weapons and maps. Balanced)? And would it work for MLG?
4. Is the game an MMO? This is a vague question. But one that should be answered. From what I understand the story evolves by what players do. But are we constantly playing with others in an open world environment?
I understand not all these questions can be answered yet. But I would appreciate answers to what you guys know. Thanks!

1. Can you customize your characters face/body shape, eye/skin color, etc? Or is it a default avatar with just customized armor?
2. What does he mean when he says we'll have choices and it's all about choices? Does he mean that when i first start the game that i can automatically head to mars? Or maybe find a derelict ship? Or head to a remote base on pluto?
3. Related to the above question and yes it's definitely mass effect related. Do we have a say in the story whatsoever? Do we have any dialogue choices that affect the main story or just maybe your characters story? Be a roguish hunter with a shady past or be a titan with a number of honorable deeds. That kinda thing.
4. When it comes to your spaceship. Will there be space combat? How much customizing will it have? Can you take it anywhere(related to 1st question)?
5. This is my last question right now. How big are the public areas? Could i just sit around from a mile off and watch another fire team get decimated by a boss. Woah that brings up another question.
6. Will there be treasure chests of sorts randomly on the map? Or will it just be random drops from enemies? and if it has a chest system

1375112269.0,1ja4xi,A Humble List of Requests,captainofallthings,1,1,1,"1. Sticky Sessions

Wouldn't it just suck if you absentmindedly walk out of a public space and when you run back in the guy you were talking to is gone because you were matched with a different session? My point is, 10-15 minutes, you are automatically matched into the same session.

2. Alt gestures

The title says it all- alternate gestures swapped out for the 4 default ones. These could include

- ""I'm watching you"" http://media.photobucket.com/user/Minimanolo/media/2zhqzw2.gif.html?filters[term]=watching%20you%20gif&amp;filters[primary]=images&amp;filters[secondary]=videos&amp;sort=1&amp;o=0

- A high five- hold the gesture to stand in a high five pose

- fist pump http://media.photobucket.com/user/Bigsteve87/media/Gifs/tumblr_l2ng8v6kkj1qzfrzw-1.gif.html?filters[term]=fist%20pump%20gif&amp;filters[primary]=images&amp;filters[secondary]=videos&amp;sort=1&amp;o=11

- for lack of a better name, with a shotgun you would cock it, and with just about anything else you shoulder it and nod a little bit.

- different dances

For the record

3. A duel system.
As much as i hate to bring up other games

4. A firing range.
A place to test your weapons. It would also be cool if you could lend your weapons to other players so they can feel you shiny new lmg for themselves- the catch being that the couldn't leave the range  until they gave it back

These are all serious requests.

So sure, you can only do this from your phone for X reason. That's not cricket you say! (If you've read Douglas Adams, it is krikit :D). Of course it isn't. Yes some kids/adolescents have them, due to them petitioning their parents.

How many and what other classes do you think there will be? What would you like to see?

I for one think that there will be a straight combat spec (if it isn't already the Titan) possibly a Commando of sorts.  Lets say Hunters and Warlocks are light armor

I also think that there would be a support class, throws down med kits (Battlefield 3) to speed up the regen healing that we are already speculating about.  Possibly also Medium or Heavy armor?

I would love to hear you guys thoughts!
