I could not decide tonight whether I was making much sense or none at all but I could tell you that I felt incredibly insightful. I was reading, figured, what better way to make this experience a little bit less miserable than with a bowl of purp. I took the first hit and immediately became more invested in my reading. I started taking notes, responding with pen &amp; paper to what I thought about the quotes that stood out the most to me.  And all the while I'm thinking, I'm not really sure if what I'm writing down makes any sense right now, but it sure fucking sounds good and seems to make a whole lot of sense. But that's kinda the whole point of highdeas. Your mind, begins to jump around, nimble, take many exits

But

So, that Carl Sagan essay from a little while ago on Reddit about weed talked a lot about his experiences of doing his work while high. And it said that he would make notes to his sober self proving that he was of sound mind and that he should take these insights seriously. Do you think there's anything to that? Like that, for some reason because weed is illegal and so discounted/frowned down upon in society that even we question our own minds' validity when we are high? There I go again, more tangents.

""Get schooled, so constricted by, forget conditioning for now, but just limitations put on us by society. You need to fit the mold, because odds are that if you don't, you will not survive here. That's just a fact. Now, onto how it limits us. We are all conditioned from birth to be who we are. What are we, people accept these boundaries as legitimate because they are indoctrinated into a ""system"" that tells them such.

A perfect example of this is our political system. We have two parties that say that they have ""extremists"" or ""fringe people, some form of Capitalism, and ""human rights"" (the rights that Americans have and so insist that they are universally right when in reality there is no such thing as a universal truth.) Nobody in the system sympathizes with Marx. Nobody in the system sympathizes with Jefferson. They two parties are the same with just minor differences in how things are implemented. The philosophy of what is implemented is completely the same, though. Nobody seems to get that. That being said, even the whole ""left and right"" way of categorizing everything becomes totally obsolete the moment that people actually start thinking about things instead of just going solely off of what they are told. And last is this whole idea of ""money."" Everybody wants money so they can feel superiority or so they can survive when they've known nothing but the opposite. Those are the two ends of the spectra as far as I can see, anyway. But what's the point? Everyone gets a job so that they can make money. Why? Because that way they can afford to buy things that they need. Things that they actually need to survive. Well here's a thought: If everybody just opened their eyes up for a second, they'd realize that there is enough of everything to go around and not have to deal with having to do anything. There is such a great concentration of wealth in such a small amount of people that it compensates for the immensity of poverty in this country 4 fold. So why do these people actually have money

And that's what society is all about

1. Maybe the world is just a simulation made by evil magic robots who use our bodies to experiment on. They took over the world and used our bodies to run experiments on. To make sure we wouldn’t wake up in the surgery (because the surgeries are really painful) they put us in a simulation. Each person gets their own simulation, but none have physical effects? This is because your mind has no bearing on your body. But drugs really make you sort of feel what’s really happening to your body in the real world, i.e., the painful surgeries, and start to see more of the real world (hallucinations). Police that are against drugs and lawmakers and shit are just evil mind probes from the evil robots that don’t want you using drugs because they don’t want you to wake up during the experiments.

1a. Also

2. When people have an audience, it’s okay to call Justin Bieber a bad person because for all we know he could be, by abandoning objective sense.

3. Every theory is possible

4. All optical illusions are actually just gifs. Even when it’s on paper

5. Alligators are just dragons

6. I forgot to mention that dragons are real. DRAGONS ARE REAL!

8. “Alice In Wonderland” is just the adventures of a small girl walking upstairs to go to bed in her typical suburban home. She is just autistic. All the funny animals she meets are just her parents making little things in her day fun.

9. I am God

10. All music is just a different fake simulation for high people to enter. That’s why you feel awesome when you listen to music while high

11. The whole world is just a joke, cupboards are serious business.

12. Everyone has a mission to kill another person in the world

13. Terrorist have long

14. Jeff Buckley died a decade and a half ago. If you can’t complete your mission

Dammit.

15. People are just chess pieces in a game of chess played between God and the Devil. How to escape the game is just to realize if you are a black piece or a white piece. No

16. We are in a simulation and the only way to escape it is the Sun. The Sun is an anomaly in their coding. If the Sun melts everything, it will explode. That is why we need it to burn everything before our chance to escape disappears forever.

17. What if America is never happened.

18. People that recreate great works of art with like toast or some shit are actually the real creators of that art reincarnated. That is why they don’t talk much.

19. Need for stuff is actually really relative.

20. Time is actually going a lot faster than we think

21. The North Pole is just heaven. That is why God looks so much like Santa Claus

22. Weed is actually the most hallucinogenic drug

23. Boxxy is actually the Queen of Everything and /b/tards are just the people smart enough to realize it. Also /b/tards are smart in this version of the world.

Jim and Pam arrive to prepare a prank on Dwight, will spend the day wearing a suit of golden armor to resemble the visage of the Amish demigod Ukeziel, who was believed to have descended from the sun to serve as the light of Jesus' path to salvation. Jim has switched out Dwight's golden armor with hastily spray-painted aluminum foil while Pam has installed a trap door beneath Dwight's desk, plunging into a dark pit occupied by an unknown - but loud - tenant.    
    
Meanwhile, rugged appeal to middle-aged women, teenagers, and hardened, truck-stop grizzled female grifters living the nomad's life, wild and untamed."" Threatening to report the absurd impetus to the corporate office, Jan relents when Michael produces the curriculum vitae of one Count Dracula
    
In the annex, thereby killing Kelly. Ryan immediately unhinges his jaw and consumes her corpse, finishing devouring her only moments before Dwight appears to borrow their stapler. Seizing the opportunity, Ryan secretly slips a dosage of mutagen into a nearby coffee cup - which, in turn, is drank by Meredith.    
    
In the interim, a testament to her undying love for him and the power she shall wield in his name as she lay waste to the cities of the Earth. Jim, impressed by the naked and wanton exercise of power, reveals he is in high the mortal vessel of the Sumerian God Hya-Ku Nuhl, a being of pure energy sent to Earth to serve as guardian over the seasons and what he refers to as ""the changing of the light."" Revealing his true form, a shimmering pool of galactic power, Pam and Jim temporarily meld into the same being
    
Once injected with the crustacean mutagen, eye stalks, pincers, and enormous mandibles. She immediately begins to destroy her surroundings, nearly decapitating Toby and razing the whole of the brake room. Her co-workers begin to engage her in battle in the vain hopes of beating her back and possibly getting her drunk enough to pass out so they could smash her head in with Stanley's chair.    
    
Angela invokes the name of Yahweh through an ancient Amish ritual with the help of Dwight's texts and library of grimoires; in a flash of blinding light, Dwight repels the Archangel because of his resemblance to Ukeziel, saving Angela and being deemed ""a righteous death dealer"" by the Archangel, thereby endowing Dwight with fantastic powers beyond the dreams of mortal men. His first act upon being bestowed with this grand power cosmic is to melt the flesh from Angela's bones, savoring every nanosecond of pain, and reducing her form to a pool of liquefied pulp, and pronouncing he would find a new queen to join him at his right hand and rule over the misty Realms of Schrute
    
During a brief and unnoticed lunar eclipse, Count Dracula victimizes Jan, plunging his fangs into her neck repeatedly and lapping up her blood from the conference table walls and floor. A nonplussed Toby suggests to Michael they flee, but Michael mistakes it for his opportunity to play the lead and ask the questions in the interview, so she stays as Dracula greedily drinks the remainder of Jan's blood and she begins the process of becoming a vampire herself. Toby, fearful for his life, urinates himself.    
    
With Meredith run amok, whose head has become a mighty piston, and Kevin in a suit of Nazi armor. Unfortunately, Meredith's back spores burst and spray both Oscar and Kevin with mutagen, horribly mutating them into a squid-men even as Meredith lay dying.    
    
Seizing an opportunity amidst the chaos, Dracula sends a vampirized Jan after Michael, who tempts him with offers of sex Michael is unable to turn down. Approaching the vampire Jan, Michael is saved only by Jim's last minute staking of Jan, a move of intense telekinesis of which Jim has only learned of. Together, Michael and Jim unite into one being - DEFENDOR, MECHA-MAN OF TAURUS CENTARI - and does battle with Count Dracula.    
    
Pam and Jim emerge from their cocoon of energy, the Jim-God and Pam-God dissolve, with only a thought, Count Dracula, and revert Meredith to her human form, deciding, however, transforming into their separate forms, culminating in a particularly brutal sequence as Dwight watches Toby and masturbates from a nearby window. Unknown to Dwight
    
The Jim-God and Pam-God resume their places amongst the office but reveal their presence is unnecessary; with their united powers, as Jim-God says, ""The errors of these mere mortals does please my lofty brow."" Pam-God mentions their lack of genitals is a low point, but guesses it was a fair trade off for ""knowing everything ever.""    
    
Finally, and Kevin with a centuries-advanced technology he has gained through Dunder-Mifflin's time travel division, thereby transforming them into his Ryan Sentries, able to do his bidding without the burden of morals or pain.

I want a chat room where, they would only get indications that someone (unidentified) had sent a message. They would not see any of the messages, and would be unable to send messages. At the end of the period, everything would be returned to normal, but the chat log would be cleared. They would not be able to directly monitor or check the chat during the white-out. 

The idea is that sometimes conversations become dominated by a few individuals. It's sort of built into the way we talk. A lot of our sentences use question and response. This means that even though no one is being exclusive

By sporadically removing participants, would promote attention. If you knew you could miss out on any one minute of the chat, you'd make sure you were paying attention to the chat enough to try to piece together the gap. It would also promote participation, because in order to keep a conversation going, new voices are needed. 

I know this sounds like an awful, say pretending to have devovled into a hate filled rage fest. 

In my farthest imaginations, but I felt a deeper meaning. This person had become attached to the *character* of the shifting chat space, as though it were itself a place of meaning where one could express their feelings without judgment.

The government would then develop a smart phone application that any tax paying citizen could use to call a ride from the publicly funded self driving cars as a public utility taxi service.

With citizen consent

Vehicles could be re-imagined and could take on the image of small lounges, meditation, training rooms, or any other purpose the populace desires in a specific region.

Driverless vehicles would essentially negate traffic accidents caused by human error, preventing the majority of possible accidents, and deaths, on the road.

By making them solar powered, but it would also all but eliminate the need for gasoline in transportation (most of which is a foreign import), which is better for the environment and the American economy. We should also look to utilizing technology similar to the [supercapcitor that can charge an iphone in 20-30 seconds] (http://www.electronista.com/articles/13/05/20/capacitors.supports.10k.recharge.cycles/) so that the machines are powered nearly perpetually.

Tax dollars previously dedicated to public transportation, though it would likely be a very large initial investment.

DD's would also no longer be necessary

""Sometimes I get two personalities, but when my high wins it takes me off on tangents. During this whole thing, I'm just watching this unfold as another Pokemon battle. Like, Inception shit. The struggle to write this was enormous.

My mind likes to fuck with me. It keeps making me think about things and then take them apart. I analyze situations and shit so my brain likes to fuck around. Today, and then my brain decides to have me analyze and think about all of the potential math involved in calculating everything about hitting the tennis ball. I conceptualized third dimension, center of gravity, intended, quadratic motion. I don't understand this shit. I don't know what's going on.

So I was just thinking about all of the things we do subliminally. Like typing on my keyboard for example. It's amazing I know how to interface a computer based on keystrokes. It's kind of a ridiculous memory. Also like how we know to refresh a page. We just know to refresh it when the computer doesn't shit idk lol

Has anyone ever noticed the background music in shows and movies? Once you hear it and acknowledge its existence

Is hot or cold more romantic?

Some newer blimps have a [side-by-side looking configuration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Lemvnight.jpg) which looks like it would add additional stability and lifting capability.

Our most advanced fighter

A dirigible could have a flight deck slung underneath, it could carry tanks and ground vehicles (a dirigible can land about anywhere).

The Zeppelins, Nimitz/Ford class, goes 35mph. Dirigibles can also go over land, and aren't as effected by weather (they can go up to and over 30,000 feet).

Besides carrying aircraft

The surface could be covered with solar panels

Dirigibles are mostly [immune to small arms fire.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airship#Safety) They fired thousands of rounds at a civilian model (no reinforcement or armor) - 2 hours later, especially if running on solar.

Cost is another plus. An aircraft carrier can cost $10 billion

Might even be able to make it stealth. If non-metal composite materials are used for the dirigible's frame (like plastics or carbon-fiber

I think there is a difference between consciousness and experience. Consciousness is really just a stream of experiences. So what does it take so simulate ""experience""? It's a particular configuration of neurons communicating creating a state that causes an experience or consciousness. A split moment of experience really can't be described and broken down

Sorry for the ramble but what exactly makes up that smallest frame of sensation, the really you'd just need to use the atoms and create that brain in that state. But I don't think the thing that causes it takes the whole brain. In fact to make a circuit of sorts that represents an experience probably wouldn't take that much. 

So with that in mind I think we could possibly be looking at the universe all wrong. To me it seems that it would be easier to create a type of collection of atoms that represents a single experience. There might just be one circuit and that is now. All the things in the past don't really exist and the future doesn't really exist. Now is just the one circuit configuration I'm experiencing as I write this. Or their could be every combination and they all exist at once. If this is the case then it would seem natural that the circuits would all be somehow linked together to create streams of consciousness.

Basically like a movie is made up of frames. Its like all the frames exist at the same time but some of them make more sense to go after another.

Every time I get really baked (lol, oh man) I think about turkey and ways to improve it.  I usually wrap turkeys in bacon which pretty much slowly bastes your turkey in bacon fat until it's all just a pool at the bottom of the pan.  

The Turkolator would be a roasting pan with a receptacle at the bottom where the juices and other liquids you want to baste the turkey with collect.  There would be some kind of pump with metal or possibly silicone tubes that would squirt the juices onto the turkey as it cooks automagically.    It could be butter, mango habanero sauce, or even a brown sugar and balsamic sauce!  The possibilities would be endless.  

The other way I see this is almost identical but the juices/sauce mix could be injected into the turkey AND spread over the top to make something even more awesome.  Since that hypospray was discussed recently on several sites

Maybe the reason the universe looks like it's expanding is that all the matter in the universe is essentially draining into black holes for the entire observable universe /and beyond/, so it just looks like things are getting further away. 

Essentially, perturbations on a scale maybe we can't measure yet began to happen due to some quality of the fluid, or maybe some initial jarring motion that rippled space-time just enough to cause tiny three-dimensional ripples of force to go shooting in all directions due to the laws of the universe. Because of the (possibly variable in type) qualities of those ripples, they move through space-time fluid frictionlessly, but they also attract one another - they are like the bowling ball on a sheet of rubber, whereby two of them naturally fall together because they bend spacetime three-dimensionally wherever they are. Another analogy would be like a boat wake, where a jetski behind it will naturally fall into the dip in the water created by the boat's passage. These initial ripples may even be below the Planck scale where we cannot measure them, or waves

Anyway, because there is a distribution (variety of sizes) in the size of individual ripples, presumably, just like when rain falls in a puddle and creates many ripples of varying sizes between where the raindrops land, except in three dimensions, so that the ripples can flow through space in any direction. These ripples tend to attract one another in predictable ways based on size and which direction they're going and how fast they're going, according to gravity. 

But because there is a huge diverse array of these ripples, ways. So you end up with maybe a lot of stable particle pairs for the lowest common size at the start, where two of these ripples encounter each other and begin to orbit one another. But you also end up with binary systems, trinary systems, even huge complexes of carefully balanced, yet gravitically accurate functional systems of systems.

These systems of systems are what make up maybe even the building blocks of the building blocks of something like a lepton or boson. Such systems may even be recognizable as such by the way they disintegrate.

Note: ripples = waves = particles = discrete units of change in the universe

The reason the universe looks holographic is that there is a constant stream of these sub-sub-sub-subparticles still rippling around - cosmic background radiation - and popping ""virtual"" particle pairs ""into existence"" via Hawking Radiation. 

This would suggest the quantum world is just a shoddy measuring device seeing fluctuations that may be able to be inferred from data like electron orbit diagrams which plot out the probability that an electron will be at any given point at any given time.  After all, maybe that could inform explanations of charge, or gravity, or magnetism. Maybe when these particle pairs ripple through the universe they leave sub-ripples, the effects of some of the particle pairs that for some reason cause a wobble, an imbalance that causes space to bend around the ensuring chaos of ripples all over the place.
Maybe this creates sub-ripples that can travel away from the electron but which still trace back to it

Maybe those sub-ripples coming from binary and trinary systems spiral through space in a given direction and connect with other sub-ripples, and then spiral in the same fashion as one another because they are literally causally linked, not spooky action at a distance.

Your writing has become quite weird
In fact
Nothing is new under the sunrise
And no two things in the Universe are alike
So you are both right and wrong at the same time.
Sink this in

I am sitting here because I am contemplating myself sitting here contemplating myself and the universe that may or may not exist inside and outside myself. It's weird stuff, I don't know, MY WHOLE LIFE?

The fact that I am writing this gives me the thought that what the fuck is thought.

I'm feeling thoughts come and go in my head as I write this sentence. Completely aware of the effects of each one

I'm not trying to make sense today. Because I am guessing, that there is an unfamiliar sensation arising in me today. 

The rule from now on is that you are not able to go back and edit anything you have written. SO LETS GO

Get loose

There seem to be a certain thing compelling me to write these thoughts. I have no idea what it is, even the thought that I'm thinking I'm being meta about being meta. Argh. 

What the thinker thinks

The opposite of every truth is also true.

I'm going to write the truest thing I know.

Everything in this world that you do in the name of good
is going to,

The passing of a thought always bring tension
Every thought is tension

I'm not quite yet convinced that thought is the cause of suffering
but many of my mentors seem to think so

is a line of thought by Alfred Korzybski

""The map is not the territory.""

I know you don't think of me as a wise man,
but from my 23 years of experience in this world

The map is not the territory.

Abstract models that we make in our minds are not to be mistaken for reality.

One thing I find remarkable about human is that we are SIMULATORS.
And there are plasible theories that say we are also probably SIMULATIONS
but I'm not going into that at the moment

because the thing to note is that me make assumptions based on insufficient data
that's what we do
even though we are not even aware of it most of the time
but you can be aware of this with ATTENTION.

At any given time
but these don't all enter your consciousness
in fact only small parts of it ever do.

What we have words for
compared to the vast landscape of perception.

Almost everyone I have found have bought into the philosophy of Aristotle
a seamingly benile thought that have been a gripping hand thoughout the late human history. 

All of you are familiar with this kind of thinking. Philosophers call it Dualism. Zen Masters call it with their stick. 

It is the notion that WORDS are reality.
That everything must be something and not the others.
That either/or dichotomy.
The knife that has divided your world.
And brought so much suffering.

Just be aware that you are using the knife
and every time you use words to understand things
you DIVIDE them up and store them into different compartments of your brain
One says
The other says, GET AWAY FROM.""

Notice it and say
STOP

Resistance is futile.

It's ridiculous. We *all* compare ourselves to others, or which brand most trusted. If you don't compare yourself to others, you'll never know where you stand: how far you've come, or how far you can go. 

Every time I get down on myself, you can't compare yourself to other people!"" Why not? I've learned a lot about myself by comparing myself to other people. I learned what qualities I lack, and wish to have; I learned about skills and talents I wanted to acquire; I learned about issues I would not have been interested in otherwise. By allowing me to see what I don't have, comparing myself to others has also allowed me to enrich my life. 

I don't think it's *comparing yourself* that's the problem. I think it's *grading yourself*. It's not evaluating yourself relative to another person. It's assigning an intrinsic, ""Jerry knows more words than I do, and therefore, I am an idiot."" An evaluation is just a piece of information. It isn't moral - it's just a resource, waiting to be used. And information about yourself can be used to build whatever you want: you can make goals, habits, and happy ambitions; or brow-beat yourself for being second to somebody.

Clarence (gay one) won the overall game (border) and gained a fuck ton of powerups along the way.  This is why he can die so often and float. Also he had to learn to sing well for some quest along the way and has become an expert.  Possibly the singing is the source of his power through spinning spells with his voice.  A single powerup he found and just fucks around now.  Who knows exactly.


Dave knows that it's just a game and a show.  That's why he does whatever he wants and just fucks everything up because it doesn't fucking matter. He knows it's a show and is just having fun because fuck it


Jerry is a fucking pussy and closet homo because that was a thing in the 80's. This is so much a part of his focus that he's just a pussy and doesn't get it's a show


Mary is a hermaphrodite and so therefor hates everything to do with gender inequality since she's basically 1/2 man. Self hate etc. Also they so fervently avoids Jerry because they immediately knew he was gay.


Black Steve is actually pretty well explained actually.  He just went to Dartmouth


Dean is a kid with a disease that requires them to be in a coma. So their wish is to have a big strong body.  Their consciousness is implanted in the body and they just enjoy themselves. It's just a shame that they were severely mentally handicapped

Larrity is the simple steriotypical character that always follows their dominant character trait (almost every show has one i.e. Barney Stinson from HIMYM).  This is probable from him getting butt hole cancer and developing other

Clare is just a really stupid bimbo and may be a real person like dave


Benny a midget actor that is transfered into a kid body for the show/game.  Kinda along the lines of Dean


Todd is the time period character that's the extreme of their stereotype.  Kinda like Mr. Larrity but instead of being a deadly sin, lives at home, geek, roleplays, fantasy stuff, etc.

I aspire to be an EE instructor sometime in my life. I enjoy tutoring electric circuits and think about analogies for people to use in conceptual understanding of the various topics like voltage, etc.. 

A little backgfound: in fluids

More to know: The body breathes air through the lungs. To inhale the lungs expand to make the lungs a lower pressure than the air outside. With a certain reference, which causes a positive diff in pressure, blowing out. 

The function of an ideal voltage source is to maintain a certain voltage at all times and allow whatever current necessary. The human body can control pressure and allows whatever air flow. So in technical terms

This riddle has a bit of a story to introduce it

John is a skeptic. He believes neither in God, John is a seeker of enlightenment.

One night,"" and pulls out a small, jet black, palm-sized box. Upon trying to imagine this bizarre scenario, John dreams that he exists only in that small, confined space within the box. Yet, while inside it, so infinite

Suddenly, it pervades his consciousness. John turns and sees him, clear as day in the infinite darkness of the box, but cannot identify him. He wakes from his dream, still having not identified who, or what, the figure in the box is.

The dream recurs nightly for months, decides to go to a psychiatrist to work out his dreams. While in the shrink's waiting room, a priest sits down next to John. They engage in conversation, and the priest introduces himself as Father Charles. He asks John, ""So why are you here today?"" John tells him about his dreams, how they have been recurring, and the unidentifiable figure who pervades his very consciousness. He also tells him about how he seeks answers, to his existence, ""Have you ever thought, thanks the priest

Later that night, but now he knows that it is God. When he wakes up in the morning he sits for a long while and ponders, ""How can God's entire infinite, all-knowing consciousness be encased in such a finite space like that box??"" Then it hit him - the answer. Suddenly, John believes in God. He goes to church and lives his life in the name of Jesus.

OKAY GUYS! Now, but I thought this up while flying highhh and it really got me thinking.

So think of the question like this: If everything you knew existed in a small box, how can he exist in the box?

1356140712.0,159cse,The Fourth Dimension,enerkachoo,3,2,3,"Consider this:

.

We do not live in a 3D world, and depth. There is a fourth dimension, and that dimension is **time**. You're probably thinking I'm crazy, but hold on. There's some logic behind this.

.

Picture a zero-dimensional object, width, or height.

.

Now make it one-dimensional object

.

Give it some sides to make it a square. Now it is two-dimensional. You can make a cross section of the square

.

Give it a third dimension to make it a cube. You'll notice that both of the previous dimensions are affected by this change. You can make a two-dimensional cross section anywhere in this cube.

.

This is where it gets tricky. Try adding another dimension that will affect the three previous dimensions; one that you could make a three-dimensional cross section of. Can you do it? Think hard.

.

Here's your answer: place the cube in motion. The cube (all three dimensions of it) moves a certain distance over *time*. A three-dimensional cross section of this can be conceptualized by imagining the cube stopped

.

**WE NEED TO GO DEEPER:** Time can also apply to a 2-dimensional object. Picture that square moving in the plane. All that matters in this scenario is length, take a photo of this. In fact, take a photo of the cube every one-hundredth of a second, making sure the camera is pointed in the same direction each time. Place all of these photos on top of each other, and you get a flipbook. A 3-dimensional flipbook. **WHAT??** There's no height involved in the square's motion, only length and width! What is this third dimension?? Well, your third dimension here is **time**. The thickness (or depth) of each photo is a representation of the .01 seconds that passed by.
