1356746994.0,15lrh7,16 habits you should do EVERYDAY. (This changed my life) [FIXED],RedanSam,1987,519,165,"**1 Exercise** – Exercise is huge. I briefly touched on what happens to you in the short term but consider also the long term effects of regular exercise. As you maintain a regiment of exercise your body fat percentage drops, you carry over a sustained vigor to other parts of your life

But do you have to do this every day? That seems strenuous. Try expanding your definition - You don’t give it your 100% every day. Some days may be 10 minutes of simple light stretching

I use this habit to help me accomplish two other things very important to me

But you don’t need me to tell you to work out. The benefits are all clearly documented by scientists and people. There are networks and resources for support and endless sources of inspiration to motivate you. 

**2 Meditation** – This habit is fucking HUGE. You need to meditate. Think about what part of the human experience spirituality addresses – the ego and fear – two concepts that are SO tied up with hitting on girls. I think a lot of people get messed up here because the benefits are very intangible at first. The “S curve” of Mastery that I described above has a very looong period of ‘sucking shit’. If you’re not experienced then your image of what meditation should be like is wrong. Fighting your expectations will be a constant battle as you learn to meditate. Here are some resources to help you learn. 
Reddit Article – Very concise introduction to meditation Mindfulness in Plain English – Amazing book that covers the topic clearly and in depth. 

Meditation Retreat – 10 day intensive mediation retreat Holosync – Tapes that induce a meditative state (great training wheels) A fortuitous person may discover means of acquiring the audio. (make sure its .flac and not .mp3 format + listen with good headphones) Practice – Hurr durr. Start meditating everyday. The evidence is in by a landslide

Once you get the hang of it you will leave your meditation sessions feeling centered, as does your sight and sound sensitivity (think of the most visceral things you do – sex, eating, sports etc.) Brain regions associated with attention, interoception and sensory processing will literally [url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1361002/ ]become thicker[/url]. 

In the long term, and happiness. This is real and you need to be doing it.


**3 Reading** - If you read the right books you will be moved

Think about what you expose yourself to. There’s a million shitty blogs on the interent written by whoever. But then theres books out there that will change your life. Books that the most gifted human beings on earth have spent years writing. A lifetime of experience

I started this habit at a half hour a day. Recently I’ve started reading about an hour a day and am burning through books. With a constant flow of information in you increase your ability for information to flow out (applying knowledge to your life)

Reading is an easy habit to put off and you need to make it a priority. If you’re not regularly reading then you may start to fall asleep as you pick up a book. Your mind is not conditioned properly and you need to force yourself through that period. Your reading speed and comprehension do pick up over time – just stick to it.

**4 Creative Recreation** - People are going to approach this one very differently but if there is something you can sit down and do purely for your enjoyment than that’s awesome. Think of a flow state activity that you can put your full expression into. For me it’s playing an instrument. If you’ve ever seen someone play the guitar or piano at an extremely high level in a non performance setting then you’ll know what I’m talking about. The “S” curve of learning an instrument is very

I generalized this habit as ‘creative recreation’ because I want to emphasize the fact that recreation is not a spectator sport. Vegetating on the couch watching commercials is not recreation. 

**5 Nutrition** - As you build a productive life your ability to stay focused and have energy becomes very important. What you eat has a huge effect on how you feel. If you eat right you can avoid energy crashes

I know that I’m definitely not the best person to give nutrition advice but the resources are out there. It should be obvious that what you put in your body is very important. Do yourself a favor and learn how your body works.
For me, and don’t buy convenience food.


**6 Reasonable Spending** - Like nutrition

Apply the concept of reactivity/proactively to your spending and you have an excellent framework for managing your money. Did you plan on making this purchase? If not then don’t do it. The nature of planning a purchase is that it is in line with your goals and budget. The nature of making an impulsive/reactive purchase is quite the opposite


**7 Brain Buster + Current Events** - Part of my morning routine is to check out the economist

I also work very hard to develop my critical and lateral thinking. Every day I challenge myself to solve one extremely difficult problem. Actually I only figure them out about 30% of the time. On my computer I have a repository of IQ

If you run a business or are any kind of decision making authority (or eventually want to be in that position) then I can’t vouch enough for this habit. You need to be sharp and informed. Period.


**8 Socia**l - Every day I make an effort to advance my social skills. Your ability to communicate effectively with human beings has so many implications in your personal and professional life. I’ve gone through experiments with this habit and I think the less your around people the more you need to make it a priority (my lifestyle right now has me around new people ALL the time

I’ve tried a few different things. For a while I really focused on listening to people with the intent to understand


**9 Personal Management** - This is the easiest of all habits to implement. Just 10 minutes a day and your bachelor pad is looking clean and fresh. Not many long term benefits here except maybe you don’t lose your possessions as often and they have and increased lifespan. In the short term doing your laundry


**10 Project 1, catching up on some reading, creating a budget, doing research, or writing a mega post for rsd :)

At the beginning of each week I choose what two projects I plan to work on and within the week I find time to fit them in. Use this habit as a way of revitalizing old projects that are collecting dust or to begin something new that you’ve been thinking about but haven’t got around to.

The effects this habit has on your short and long term productivity are huge. 


**11 Podcast/TED Talk/University Lecture** - If you’re a thinking human being with a desire for knowledge then you should be listening to podcasts

This is a habit I integrated for both its short term and long term benefits. In the short term I find it interesting to learn about new topics. A lot of times it’s on a subject I’m interested in at the time

If you engaged yourself with this material every day

*For a practical tip


**12 Language** - Every day I spend thirty minutes learning a new language. This is an ongoing task that I struggled to integrate. You realize almost no immediate benefit and that makes it exceptionally difficult to do every day. The “S” curve of mastery is very

But alas

For me

For some practical advice getting started I recommend the rosetta stone. It’s a visual program that is a great way for getting you started. Listen to talk radio (via internet) and get a language book with exercises to help you practice. Get a women your seeing to join in. It accelerates the process so much if you have someone to practice speaking with. 

We are the first generation with ready access to the internet. The resources to help you pick up a language are out there and they are free – use them.

1339529884.0,uyg9r,"NoFap really will make YOU a chick magnet. Yes, nerdy, sweaty, stammering YOU",chinesegangster,367, if you choose to

Here's how: you have a primal, is intended to motivate you to jump out of bed in the morning ready to fight and fuck your way through the herd, leaving vanquished foes and satiated hoes in your wake. Unfortunately, our advanced brains and opposable thumbs over time have discovered an almost perfect and flawless cheat: Masturbation. After all, it's so much easier, so much less of a hassle, to simply cut all the corners, and polish that platinum trophy really fast until the end credits roll.

Here's where this wonderful thing we're discovering called NoFap comes in: You, perverted woman crazy fiend that you are, have a choice in how you get off.: Your hand or a vagina. You may feel like only one of those choices is viable, but that's merely because it's the EASY choice, so it appears to be the preferred one. Guess what: If you actually stop jerking off, and I mean STOP - eliminate it as a possibilty from your life (as I and many others have) - your sex starved brain and testicles will literally lead you out into the world and between the legs of a female. It just HAPPENS. Try it, you numbskull. You'll see that I speak the truth.

""But....but.... Chinesegangster, a harelip, and my breath smells like a circus chimp's used diaper!""

 Fine. Lower your standards and look again. The only reason your standards are so irrationally high in the first place is because of that damn computer screen you've been sitting in front of half your life. Hint: now that you're no longer wasting your life in your comfy jerk-off chair, and brush your teeth. NO MATTER WHO YOU ARE, THERE ARE REAL WOMEN OUT THERE WHO WILL HAVE SEX WITH YOU. They're just waiting for you to poke your head into their personal space and say ""Hello beautiful. You look bored. Can I help you with that?"" Don't believe me? Go to the Manga section at Barnes and Noble right now. There are three (3) nerdy girls on the floor at this very moment feeling lonely and unattractive, faces pressed into some crappy Japanese rape comic, dreaming of the day that someone like you comes along and says those exact words.

Stop mentally objecting to the wisdom of what I'm saying and automatically trying to make yourself the exception to this absolute rule. You're not different, and mother nature wants your penis to hang out inside wet vaginas. PORN HAS BEEN COCKBLOCKING YOU FROM YOURSELF. SNAP OUT OF IT! Stop jerking off, and sex will happen to you. You will do it for yourself on an unconscious and biological level and you will literally marvel as it's happening. And it will be FUN. Trust me, meeting and flirting with young women may be effort, but it sure as hell isn't work.

After I hit 90, I can totally keep changing my life while fapping to porn, it's not that big of a difference."" 

So I stopped and decided to fap until I wanted to go back to NoFap, it has taught me that addiction is very strong.

You see, I remembered what they are.

Disclaimer- 

If you were feeling sufficient effects of no fap, it will get mundane. So you need to spice it up or you will feel mediocre again. This leads to my first major tip, in no particular order:

-Work out. At least 3 times a week.

The thing with working out

&gt; I workout because I wanna look good for the girls man.

That's not what working out should be for. That's not the guide to happiness. That's a guide to dependence. You should want to work out to improve your health, you're not going to like the person you see. If you start working out, you're going to like the way you look. I guarantee it. This leads into the next one:

- Erase your dependency. Especially on girls and sex.

The prevailing mentality on NoFap is dangerous. Very much so. I see posts all the times that say ""I got girls man. NoFap is working perfectly!"" Which is fine. Be happy, this **doesn't work**.""

NoFap is not a journey to get girls to touch your penis. It is a personal and spiritual journey in a lot of ways. If you are dependent on the love of girls

Happiness isn't about girls. The moment you realize you can go on for the rest of your life unmarried but still happy is the moment you erase that dependence.  The belief that sex is so important is one of the biggest reasons people relapse. Because they can't control their lust. Your testes will not explode if you don't jack off or fuck something. You can be happy with yourself, girls tend to like you more because they can tell you aren't needy. How so? Because you don't act like this girl is quite possibly your only chance to fuck for the rest of your life and you don't act like you can't blow this or it's all over. Become self reliant. And:

- Become congruent.

There's a principle called Cognitive Dissonance in psychology. It's when you perceive something that sends two conflicting messages. When this happens

&gt; I wanna stay on NoFap

Two conflicting messages. Sad, they grow and fuck up your mind. So, eliminate negative thoughts like that when you think them and let positive thoughts flow.  This is also why dependence is painful.

If your belief is ""I don't need girls"" but you're getting depressed when you get rejected, but doing another. And actions speak louder then words, so watch this carefully. 

- Don't edge. Period.
Like the earlier weed analogy, we often go into sexual hazes when we get horny. Nothing snaps you out of this later then thinking about where this behavior will leave you. When you finish, you will feel bad and regret the 2 seconds pleasure. I promise you that. It's only when you look down and see you're covered in your semen that the true shame sets in and you regret your actions. It's playing Russian roulette. Every time you play you have a chance of losing everything you've worked hard for.

-Cold Showers.
I'm not going to tell you your testosterone increases. But it kills urges really hard. And it makes you feel more awake. Good for morning rituals.

-Change your life.
NoFap is energy. Lots of it. Use it to change your life. Learn a new hobby, work out, get better grades. Make a constructive use of your time.  Clearly, you're here for a reason. You don't like where you are now, probably. You will stay there until you choose to move. Either you whine or you climb. And the ladder is in front of you.

- Stop complaining.

Complaining is the least constructive thing in the world. Not quite destructive, and poisoning your mental state. It's unnecessary and destructive, so don't do it.  How do you stop this?

- Be optimistic. 
Look to the bright side of everything. Smile more. Be happy. It's been proven that if you smile, eliminate them and replace them with positive thoughts. Traffic Jam? Chance to relax and listen to good music. If you know you're fucked or that you're going to be in trouble no matter what, who cares anymore? What use is there getting upset when there's nothing you can do to change it? Stop worrying. It's on par with complaining in terms of uselessness. Let positivity flow. Become that guy who sees the bright side to everything.

- Fake it til you make it.
The thing with confidence is that it's in a lot of ways a state of being. If you think that you are great and successful

- Filters.
K9

- Watching Porn.
Self explanatory. Dissonance.

- Get Active.

Make something of your life. Get the fuck off your computer and out of your comfort zone. Just go outside and do shit. As they say

And finally

- Believe in yourself.

Believe you can do it. Make your thoughts congruent with your actions. Take it one day at a time. The journey of a 1000 miles begins with a single step. You do not sprint a marathon. So stop trying to take 90 days as 3 months. Think of it as 90 24 hour segments. Deal with each day at a time. If you look up Mount Everest from the bottom, just climb. When you're at the top, you have permission to look down.

Stay strong fapstronauts. Those are my tips to success. Now if you'll excuse me

I was then, I am starting to see things differently. Just because I enjoy spending time alone does not mean that I have to continue to be afraid of taking initiative when it comes to going after what I want.


Over dinner, because even back then engaging women was terrifying for me. Though, like most adolescent boys, I did have quite a few shamefully awkward encounters with the hot one.

Fast forward to yesterday, charming, and beautiful woman. I didn't feel intimidated, though...I felt allured.

She told me she spends her time between two cities--one of which I live in. She seemed to be interested and engaged when I was talking about my life


Later, maybe I'll just find her on Facebook and send her a message...' I knew that's not what the ideal me would do, and I wondered what kind of impression that would give compared to directly asking her out. But I was just too scared. Those people used to have so much power over me, and apparently they still did.

After a while, and chances are you'll never see any of these people again.' Didn't matter--I had already succumbed to my fear. I had resigned myself to being a coward by refusing to directly approach what I want.

We were walking around the corner, walked up to her, and asked her out to a beer. Right in front of the guy that used to bully me. Right in front of the hot girl who wanted nothing to do with me in high school. I have **never** asked anyone out that directly, much less in a situation like this...she seemed surprised for a moment, and then enthusiastically agreed to meet up.

The hot girl watched me as I walked by; I smugly said hello and goodbye to her in the same sentence. I could almost taste her incredulity.


Joseph Campbell said that a man must slay the monsters of his nursery before he can begin his heroic journey. I don't care if the woman I asked out never actually goes out with me--the fact that I spat in the face of everything I used to be scared of made the whole night worthwhile. It showed me that even though I am fundamentally the same person

For the record

I didn't ask her out because I stopped fapping. I asked her out

Women NEED NoFappers. We need to be sexy again. We need a guy who can look at his girlfriend, and find her attractive. I'm looking for that, and I hope I find it, because in the end, I can't settle for less. I can't waste my time trying to fix myself and deal with rejection and disappointment because he couldn't stay away from a hundred other, new, sexier girls. It's too heartbreaking.

So thank you, I should say). You're getting back to normal, you're standing up and saying to the world ""Sex should be sexy! Men should want their women more than their computers!""

Relieved of the pain you don't have to feel now that you're in your nest. You love the nest, it makes you feel comfy. It keeps you sane, you'd go insane if you didn't have this. When you don't get the nest for two days, you are fucking sick! This nest is the prison you are in fapstronaut, what you've created for yourself. YOU ARE LIVING YOUR LIFE IN A TRACE, WAKE UP. This is whats stopping you from getting the superpowers

Things were not always like this. When you were a kid, you were not so fearful. You were superman. When you really did study for the test due next week. Things got awry somewhere down the line, maybe it sparked as a solution once when you discovered that fapping before the test relieves you of the stress and tension. You started playing video games to keep yourself distracted from the thought that you were wasting your time, and went further down the spiral. You did that again, and again, and again and soon you had created a nest, your prison, you started loving the prison. The prison turned down the volume for you, boredom. Your prison was PMO.

I'm 18 guys, be unproductive; for fapping or any other mindless activity are generally the same. A feeling of wanting to get back to the nest. When I'm stressed, when I want to escape.

I have a very happy life, I lost focus. I lost focus when a big goal I'd chosen for myself became too overwhelming to accomplish. I created my nest then. In a remarkable turn of events, I have the same goal again. Life gave me another chance to conquer my fear, although it's seemingly impossible to accomplish it under the time I've been given, this time I won't stop myself short. I'll give my best till the last second. I'll live my life and I'll get out of the prison. 

NoFap is not a magic bullet that will solve all your life's problems. But getting out of your prison would. You have to stop being a bitch and face stuff, that is exactly when you should do them. This is your life fapstronaut, don't let you dick, your brain, or your emotions control your life! Everytime you force yourself out of the prison, you wake up a part of yourself. You wake up the superman in you. People who get out of fapping and who also get out of their prisons, get the superpowers. The superpowers are lying dormant in you, waiting for you to wake up and fucking use them

Edit - Thanks for the overwhelming response guys. I just wrote this post to tell my girlfriend why I was doing NoFap. You guys rock!",,t5_2skrn,1359463119.0,,month4,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/17g9bi/want_superpowers_read_this/

1368910701.0,1elfxn,Advice to the younger guys,Oxberg,939,169,203,"I would like to share some thoughts as an older guy on this nofap post. I have never posted anything on any website before but I really would like to say something now. Hopefully it won't sound like just some guy who wants to post his amazing insights that everyone has heard a thousand times before. 
I am 58 years old. A lot of the posters on this subject seem to be much younger than me. High school kids. College kids. I am amazed at some of the ideas and insights they come with when it comes to giving up fapping and porn and how important it is. It inspires me greatly. 
Now don't get me wrong. I'm a middle class guy living a middle class life. Married
But I am haunted by all of the things I could have done. If I had had more interest in life and more ambition, more likely than not I spent the time fantasizing and fapping accompanied by its subsequent hangover. 
If I had been smarter I would have gotten help
You feel as if everyone else is doing the right thing and living a proper life while you sit in a dark room going from image to image in search of the perfect one
You live in absolute fear of being found out for what you are. You can't look people in the eye because you just know that they'll be able to tell what a complete jack off you are.  
When you're alone though
Somehow you make through the days at work. You're presentable. You can get the minimum amount of work done so that people will think you're okay. But you lack drive. You lack ambition. Other people will come in and move up quickly
Years go by and you don't realize it but time is running out. I've had friends who have lived and died in less time than I have spent fantasizing my life away. 
Any venturing out of your shell and you find yourself running back to the safety of your dark room and your computer screen. Any stressful situation and you find yourself clamoring back to your computer screen. 
But the thing is
But how did you get like this? Is it your fault? Can you really do anything about it? 
The fact is
We are surrounded from the minute we get up in the morning until we go to bed way too late by an incredible amount of stimulation. Fast pulsing music
Our entire exsistence is marketed to us 24 hours a day, it's there underneath somewhere. 
Fot thousands of years, punctuated occassionally by brief moments of intense stimulation. Whether you were running from some wild animal hoping not to get eaten or having sex with one of the few partners available to you, for the most part you lived day to day slower and with very little stimulation. That is how humans evolved
Now we are bombarded 24 hours a day
It has made us
We are no different from the heroin addicts who steal whatever they can get their hands on to feed their addiction. We are no different from the crack addict who gets his fix and lays on the couch while his eyes roll back in his head as he avoids life and the real world. Only we steal time. We steal from the future. 
We look at heroin addicts and feel sorry for them. We abhor the fact that they waste their one opportunity at life and become a living shell of a human being
Maybe our addiction isn't so obvious. Maybe it isn't quite as lethal
But
There is nothing wrong with you. You're not immoral, plain and simple.
Your brain that is addicted to dopamine can be weaned off of it. It isn't easy, if unused, become overgrown and impassable. 
New paths can be made
So take it one day at a time. Live good 5 minute periods
As I've read before, good days add up to good weeks, and so on. 
Live open. Live clean. Share. Get help wherever you can. Find like minded individuals. Use whatever you can find as motivation. Turn off your fucking computer. Quiet down your life and think about what you want and not what others tell you to want. Screw them. They've sucked enough life out of you. Do what you want to do now. 
The only person in your way is yourself. You can change and do whatever you want. 
Sorry about the long post. I don't mean to preach because I struggle and don't have all of the answers. What I think I have is an outlook from someone who is older and if I can share that with the guys on this site who are younger and it gives them more insight about what the effects could be if they spend too much of their lives looking in the mirror wondering what is wrong with them
It is given with honesty and a hope that it will be a beneficial perspective to those that are young enough and have many years ahead to do great things in this world. ",,t5_2skrn,False,,month3,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1elfxn/advice_to_the_younger_guys/
1361963565.0,19bl70,25 Reasons to do NoFap,brokenfap,965,197,269,"1.	Spend lots of time engaging in other productive activities that will turn you into a much more qualified person.


2.	Quit objectifying women


3.	Much higher confidence


4.	Be a free man who wanders at will. No more a desperate slave with no control over self-fate.


5.	Start feeling these intense emotions all the time


6.	Much less procrastinating. Get things done on time


7.	No more scared to let other people use your computer


8.	Burst with newfound energy. *Run Forrest Run*.


9.	Start - possibly for the first time since puberty - to *really* love yourself for who you are. The self that you always loved but unfortunately kept locked away in a self-built prison in your body


10.	Much less depression. You’ll keep finding yourself feeling happy and positive for no apparent reasons


11.	Regain that long lost ability of actually falling truely, because you may end up desperately thinking about that one SO, instead of getting hypnotized stupid by all that fabricated and useless, zombified novelty in porn.


12.	Grow the ability to maintain a healthy long-term relationship where you can actually be trustworthy


13.	THE ED. Inevitably caused by the PMO addiction. Need I say more? NEED I SAY MORE?


14.	After a long enough streak, one half of you was completely missing from their sight.  That one half was busy wasting himself away in a life of secrecy built on shame. He was not present. That half of you did not exist in the real world. And the other half that did exist in the real world was constantly insecure and double minded in his attitude, never being able to give his best because of the PMO addiction. Now people will start to care more about you because you will be at least twice more present in their lives. And when I say present, I mean PRESENT. INFLUENTIAL. IMPRESSIVE. 


15.	Increased overall physical health


16.	You can add to that health by actively working out too you know


17.	Master your knowledge on how the plastic structure of your brain impacts your behavior. This new modern insight into **neuroplasticity** is an eventual and positive side effect of doing NoFap through YBOP and will have its positive impact on **every** aspect of your life depending on what you do with it. 


18.	Be much more creative than before. You are forcing your brain to leave its biggest comfort zone. That means it has to come up with new neuron pathways to survive. Those new pathways mean new ideas. New ideas mean better creativity in whatever you are keeping your brain busy with. Innovate your life.


19.	An immense increase in willpower. One badass lion of willpower. How hard could *anything* be


20.	*Attention Magnetism*. If you’re doing it right, but when you come to think of it, it's nothing magical really: Nature runs its course when you run yours.


21.	Piece of cake to initiate dialogues


22.	No more of that creepy feeling of two personalities one of which you always have to hide and makes you feel like you'd almost rather commit suicide than found out. Honest with self


23.	No


24.	Get rid of other bad habits as well. NoFap initiates the good domino effect for your life.


25.	Be 1 in a 1


In contrast;

1 reason to do PMO:

1. Numb yourself so that you can maintain a vegetably satisfied life instead of achieving all these real traits, in the long run, the lack of all these traits is inevitably going to take its toll on you, quiet terribly I assure you.


Now, I'd pay all I ever had to buy that. Apparently there is none, but there is NoFap. I will give all I have to do NoFap and to run from PMO, because I know I have to and there is no other way around my life.

Best regards and best wishes to all Fapstronauts!

I used to think this way. I'd never put it so bluntly to myself. And I thought

This is not how marriage works. This is not how strong

And I do not mean that last sentence as an insult

But I do think you need to change your thinking. 

Instead of trying to stop masturbating all of the time so that you can get real sex all the time. Maybe try to just stop wanting sex all the time. 

Learn to appreciate other aspects of your life

I want to see less ""37 days without PMO. Got a girl's number today."" I want to see more, ""Was able to focus long enough to learn Metallica's Battery."" 

I want to hear about how before, and it sounded okay, but you were more or less going through the motions. But now. Now that you aren't addicted to jerking off. You had no urge to be finished with the exercise. You thought of nothing else but your relationship to the guitar. You were a ROCK GOD!

And it needs to be this way throughout the rest of your life. 

Do not value yourself based on how many girls you're getting

You have work to do right now. You can't be bothered to make love to your girl friend every single fucking night

You are Rocky. And Rocky can't afford to fuck Adrian right now because Rocky has a big fight coming up and women weaken knees. ",,t5_2skrn,False,,month6,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/18bzet/if_you_are_doing_this_to_get_the_girl_you_have/

1. It doesn't take a superpower. If you're telling yourself that the 90day guys have something you don't have, plastic sex-impersonation known as porn. We're all human.

2. Stop teasing yourself. There's no way you can browse porn galleries 'just to look'. Porn always walks hand-in-gooey-hand with masturbation. If you do one

3. While on the topic: yeah, your body is going to build up healthy levels of energy. That's a good thing. Now what are you gonna do about it? Channel that energy into the gym, into jogging, or just plan 'ole pushups. Start up a hobby, learn a craft, go walking, etc. Just get busy. Being a couch potato does not encourage you onward. 

4. Realize that you may be simultaneously facing an internet addiction. I mention this because I experienced it. I would stay up late at night browsing the web ... pointless idle time. And take a wild guess what happened when boredom really set in? Porn. If you cut back on your online time

5. Determined guys take drastic measures. There's no shame in that. How badly do you want to be free of this mad cycle of PMO? What would you give to *get out*? Some guys insist on taking their iPads to bed to 'browse the net' but then - lo and behold - start browsing porn. Yikes

6. Focus on today. Don't worry about the other days left to complete the 90day milestone. You are always on DAY ONE because you should only focus on ONE DAY per day. Take it in 24 hour bits. Choose today to end the day being PMO free. Tomorrow choose to make the same choices you made today.

7. It requires a lifestyle change and will - most awesomely - *result* in a lifestyle change. Turning your back on PMO requires you to make certain changes that others might call 'dramatic'. Just call them 'necessary' and nothing more. Don't run from it

8. Like everything else in this world

9. If you mess up, and move on. After all....see point #1. 

10. The **real** thing is *multipliably* times better than the plastic porn thing. To have someone's arms around you, wanting to give all she is to you, in all her faults accepting all of yours, tenderly &amp; warmly kissing you, cuddling you, touching you with that feminine softness, whispering, smiling, and not just a hole to stick your dick into. PMO deadens your senses, warm

Those aren’t the days I feel like masturbating.

It’s the bad ones. 

I went out on a bad date. Or didn’t hook up with a girl on New Years after she made out with me for an hour. Or I see a smoking hot girl in black tights and I’m overwhelmed by how much I want her. Things aren’t happening in my romantic life like I want. That’s when I want to masturbate. 

It's 6 pm on Sunday evening. I’m coming home in a cab. I'm a few blocks from my apartment. Alone. Horny. Feelin down. I’m too tired to go out. I just want to go home and relax. Watch a movie. And masturbate. 

I know what masturbation is. It’s a signal to myself that I’ve hit bottom. That I may as well gratify myself

But as I walk through the hallway of my apartment building

This day is not my life. I’m better than this. This moment doesn’t define who I am. I will withhold.

There’s nothing valiant about withholding. The Rocky theme song is not playing in the background for something I *didn’t* do (masturbate). I won’t transform into a power extrovert or avert depression and anxiety—at least not tonight. There’s nothing tragically artistic about puritanism. No woman ever loved a man for his virtue.

&gt;That all being said, focus, and time management that enables you to improve your over all status, and well-being will greatly propel your chances of meeting a mate, among other things.

Sorry if this is kinda disjointed, cut the porn out. the ways it fucks with your head is unbelievable. it conditions you to think that porn is normal, that fucking with no emotional attachment is the standard. women aren't something you care about, they just become over-sexualized things that you don't desire as a person, but just to conquer. Every relationship you have ever had or will ever have is hurt by an addiction to porn, and if you use it long enough, you will be addicted. That's how it's designed

Either way, It seriously helps.

Had to reset again yesterday. Read something in this book I’m reading about neurology that changed everything. I suddenly realized NoFap is serious

A scientist mapped the brain of a Silver Spring monkey. He did this by opening the brain up and stimulated the monkey’s thumb, which was next to the ones that fired for the middle finger and so on. They were aligned.

Next they sewed the index and middle finger together on the monkey (quite cruel actually) and waited for two months. Then they opened the brain up again. They stroked the thumb and saw the neurons fire at the same place as before. Now they stroked the index finger, so that there where there used to be two separate neuron maps for the index- and middle-finger, there were now just one big map.

**Neurons that fire together wire together!** Some professional guitarists also experience this when they get something called focal dystonia when they can’t move two fingers separately

This means that if you watch porn, degrading and violent themes - you not only experience sex and violence together – you rewire your brain and change the neuron structure each time so sex and violence wire together in your brain. No wonder a lot of NoFappers here testifies that they experience ED (which to be blunt is euphemism for impotence).

When we watch porn we not only experience it, acting as “glue” since pleasant experiences get wired more easily.

Getting hard when in a normal relationship with a girl will be just as impossible as for the monkey to use his fingers individually. If after *two months* the monkeys fingers had merged into one neuron map

The day before yesterday was the last time I ever watched porn.

Attention whoring aside it was probably one of the loneliest and depressing birthdays I've ever had. I had made plans two weeks ago to go to a particular bar in downtown San Francisco and invited only a handful of my closest friends. I'm not much of a drinker but I was certainly looking forward to the ceremonial purchase of my first legal beer. I was looking forward to a fun night out with friends

A friend of mine

When I got out of my meeting at around 8:30pm I called Sarah and despite only a few hours earlier expressing how excited she was she informed me that she had changed her mind because she was feeling ""sleep deprived"". At the time I didn't think anything of it and had even decided that I would go to this bar and have a good time regardless of who was there and who wasn't. I was, but that thought began to weigh heavily on me as I drove into SF and subsequently began walking from where I parked the car to the bar.

I saw a small gathering a people smoking cigarettes at the entrance and suddenly the loneliness had all hit. Despite having had to pay toll to cross the bridge and enter the city I went back to my car and drove aimlessly for about 15 minutes before finally deciding to drive home. I stopped by the local Safeway and bought some frozen pizza and a six pack and went home to read a book and try not to let myself become too emotional. 

Unfortunately for me my mom was still awake, about the events of that evening because I was too ashamed to admit that no one seemed to care enough to celebrate what I was hoping would be my big day. She reminded me that I had chose to go out with friends instead of celebrate with the family and that was the final straw. I broke down into panting sobs and tears  and literally had to beg her to leave me the hell alone. 

I was consumed with anger and loneliness and on top of that I had been sleeping an average of 3 hours a night for a little over a week due to marijuana withdrawal. I wanted to fap so bad. I wanted everything to just go away

Somewhere in all of this a little voice in my head told me that this was a good thing. I said aloud to myself ""I would rather feel like complete and total shit than run away from my feelings"". And it was true. I spent the next half hour or so waiting for the feelings to pass. They never did. As I type this I still feel like the biggest piece of shit this cosmic asshole we call the universe had ever conceived. 

But I didn't fap. And to me that's what was important.

Anyhow

Please forgive the rambling wall of text

**tl;dr** Spent birthday alone. Had emotional breakdown. Didn't fap.

All that remained was to format the paper

I looked in disbelief and in shock that my computer froze. I couldn't do anything, and was like, no worries maybe it's stored in a separate location. I went on google, searched how to recover lost word files. And I could not find where my paper had disappeared to where it was...It was gone

It was around 5AM, opened up a new tab incognito on Chrome and went to my bookmarks all the way to the bottom of the list was a folder marked ""NSFW."" I clicked on it, and I clicked on a link of what used to be my favorite porn video. I pressed play and as I had my hands down my pants I just looked at the screen and said, ""Fuck this."" I slammed onto the ALT+F4 keys on my keyboard, opened up a new Word Document and started typing. Since I had most of my paper already done, I knew what to write and it was a breeze. I finished that paper in an hour and a half and by 7AM the time I normally wake up to go to school. I submitted my paper onto the online dropbox, took a shower and went on with today.

I realized it was my fault later on that I hadn't save my document otherwise I wouldn't have to go through this. I would've had at least 3 hours of sleep

I am a MA/PHD student focusing on propaganda and philosophical systems. I am also an addict. I’ve prepped this essay for my own benefit (because like most academics, I’ve been thoroughly impressed by the degree of self-awareness in so many on this forum, especially from young people. Self-awareness largely arises when people break out of the matrix of the propagandized system into which they were born. This has led me to develop a thesis that a pillar of our own propaganda system in contemporary America, and the wider West, is an extreme manipulation of human sexuality. 

Propaganda is composed of lies built on top of truths—i.e. the Germans are a great a noble people of history and accomplishment (truth) who have fallen only because of our society’s manipulation by the Jews (lie). Our own society is based on many good truths and virtues (i.e. the value of individual freedom, etc) and many lies (i.e. fapping is good for you). One of the things that defines propaganda is that it does not allow people to think—to take pause and examine their life. In a word, silence. It totally encompasses their life whether at home through TV, computers, and newspapers or in public through posters, billboards, concerts,’ the cinema

As everyone here knows, and I was good friends with his son who was of the same age. So, one day we snuck into his dad’s closet and I got to see my first Hustler magazine at the ripe old age of 8. The images from that first magazine are burned into my mind, with its airbrushed pictures of artificially enhanced women splattered in oil and contorted around the sexual organs of anonymous men. This was my first experience of human sexuality, which is wrong. It is a perverse and bent image of sexuality, yet already by brain was being shaped to accept it is true and good. My pre-pubescent self didn’t even know what I was looking at but something in me liked it. Naturally, the rest of much of my childhood was greatly defined by trying to acquire porn. I imagine this story is reflected in many people reading this. 

This is not freedom. This is the enslaving of our youth. I quoted St. Augustine above because he is one of history’s greatest philosophers of human freedom. He basically wrote that freedom is not being able to do whatever you want, or a hit, or control my temper, I am not free. Something else controls me. One of Augustine’s great vices was sex, not for purpose of enhancing intimacy, or pro-creation, but to get-off. He lived in the sex-obsessed and pornographic world of ancient Rome at its decadent height, he found that he couldn’t. His ‘Confessions’ are largely an autobiographical account of his struggle with his vice. Hence he’s history’s first fapstronaut. 

Human history is fully of religions, they failed. Lofty goals like enlightenment, holiness, salvation, education, not-fapping, etc could not be accomplished by individuals acting alone—hence religions organized, monasteries built

I found it to be unnatural. After almost 3 months of doing it, and last night was one of them. I don't think it's that bad to fap.

However, but I don't to constantly be thinking about it and craving it.

My conclusion is to try and focus any sexual thoughts and feelings on reality, for a lot of people is that their sexual thoughts and arousal reactions are linked to imaginary forms of sex, namely porn. The simple fact is that real life sex is absolutely nothing like PMO. PMO won't prepare you for being with a real person; in fact, it will probably make it impossible, if your brain is used to getting aroused by porn instead of real people.

But fapping on its own, as a way to pass the time, as a problem. I also see fapping to porn as a problem. But if every once in a while you get the urge, I think it's misguided to think that satisfying it just on your own will somehow negatively impact your life.

My goals now are these: don't fap just for the sake of it

I've had porn-induced ED since I was 17 years old (26 now). I started looking at porn a LOT when I was 13, I was fantasizing about porn the entire time. I would basically masturbate myself by using her lady parts instead of my hand. I would have to close my eyes the whole time and concentrate as hard as I could on the porn images in my head.

Well last night, and it. was. phenomenal. I had NO idea sex was supposed to feel like that.

I was feeling her body, and it was everything I could have ever asked for.

After we finished, eyes wide open, heart racing, remembering where I was 7 months ago... And where I am now. I couldn't help but to shed a tear of joy. It was the culmination of 7 months worth of extremely hard work and undying effort... And it all came together so beautifully.

Nofap has saved my life. This community has saved my life. I didn't realize what a shitty, and I've never been happier.

That's pretty much all I wanted to say

*Got a job that I love and pays 50% more.

*Worked out 5-6 times per week

*Drastically changed my diet and lost 30 pounds

*Began meditating

*Countless more measurable improvements

But the biggest improvement is just the general outlook on life. There's no more bullshit excuses holding me back. There's no more lying to myself about ANYTHING. Accepting my addiction to porn and dealing with it was extremely therapeutic

I hadn't planned to ever make a post of my own on here.  But upon seeing my counter

First of all, let it be this: YOU **CAN** DO THIS, especially with the aid of this fine group of allies.

I guess I'll tell a little of my story

I cut masturbation and pornography out of my life a little over six years ago, but I'm lucky in that I never had an addiction to pornography itself.  So cutting that was pretty simple for me personally, which I'm very grateful for.

Cutting out masturbation, it's easily one the hardest things I have ever done.

People have all sorts of reasons for doing this.  Mine were, and began getting much more involved in my faith during high school.  By junior year, I knew that overcoming this was a nonnegotiable.  The Church classifies masturbation as a mortal sin, i.e. one that, if done with full knowledge and full freedom, ""destroys charity in the heart of man"", as the Catechism puts it, as venial sin does.

I know many of you are non-Catholics and non-Christians and atheists and whatever else.  I'm proud to stand by your side in this common battle regardless.  And of course, so I don't think this is a peculiarly Catholic issue by any means.  I think our ethical ordinances are precisely those directives that lead us to the achievement of true happiness and flourishing as human persons, which is something that's hardly exclusive to Catholicism.  (And to my mind, my experiences and those of others on this subreddit confirm that, at least in the case of masturbation and pornography, the Church seems to know what she's talking about here, in a way that should resonate with all people regardless of their religious tradition.)  So even if you're not Catholic, sure

So then, as an effect of its being sinful), masturbation was occupying my thoughts constantly.  It was turning me in on my own person, rather than orienting me towards love of others.  It had led to a screwed up view of girls, as we know all too well.  But in my case, it also led to a screwed up view of guys, in that I began to see myself and all my guy friends as merely sexual beings.  This made forming close friendships tough--not because I was attracted to my guy friends, having lost the ability to see people as much more than walking genitals.  If I wasn't going to be gay with my friends

At that point, and the accompanying realization that I was truly addicted, strengthened my resolve.  It also served a healthy dose of humility: I became 100% convinced that I could not do this alone.

Thus, they'd all had similar struggles and were saddled with similar addictions.  So we entered into this battle together, which made all the difference in the world.  Sure, we'd hold each other accountable, but it was way more than that.  We suddenly had a truly *common* cause.  When overcoming masturbation especially, I believe this is essential, because the sin works by turning what is essentially an other-directed capacity 180 degrees around, myself, those conversations likewise helped bring us out of our own individual bubbles and escape temptation.

It still wasn't easy.  In fact, and viscerally aware that I was set back in my mission.  (I'm happy for all those on here who say they have ""superpowers"" at that early stage, but I felt more like I was strapped with kryptonite for at least a few weeks.)  This back-and-forth went on for a couple months, succeeding and failing at various points, making progress relative to where I'd been before, but still comfortably in the clutches of the addiction.

But finally, I was so determined never to relive those early days of the struggle, that convincing myself to resist became a lot easier to do.

In time, or at least a non-live-issue.  (I still face temptation from time to time, of course, even six years later, but it's not even close to insurmountable, which is how it felt back then.)  It no longer occupies my thought all the time, and I'm immensely happier as a result.  I've had successful romantic relationships (in the sense of intimate and happy relationships that succeeded, in showing us that we weren't right for each other in a 'til-death-do-you-part sense).  And I now, life is exceptionally better without masturbation

One interesting thing to me about the whole healing process was this: Masturbation had been such an overwhelming addiction for me that it had successfully blinded me to every other problem area in my life / character.  It wasn't until I had successfully overcome it that I was able to see myself more clearly and comprehensively, I'd confess masturbation and then BS a few other invented sins that didn't seem all that accurate or pressing at the time, speaking mostly in abstractions.  Now, I can actually see how many things there are for me to confess honestly, and then to work on improving on.  And that's a great and positive thing--I get to understand where I need work and how to keep striving towards fulfillment and flourishing.  That may not mean much to a non-Catholic, but I promise, it was and is huge to me.  It's self-knowledge

So now, no matter how far gone you are today.  I'm also here to tell you that overcoming this is worthwhile--SO WORTHWHILE.  Please don't give up.  You can and should absolutely do this.

I'll end off with just a few pieces of advice.  (I hardly think myself a sage on this or any issue

(1) **You cannot do this alone.**  This subreddit is so stellar for building an online community of allies in common cause, or to several friends, or to whomever you can to support you in this.  This addiction thrives in the darkness and in isolation.  To overcome it, bring it to light and let others help you, in whatever capacity that makes sense in your life.

(2) **Resolve that you're really done with this for good.**  (Soon-to-be-Saint) John Paul II had a line I think is dead-on: ""The person who does not decide to love forever will find it very difficult to really love for even one day.""  The same applies here, because there’s no real difference between lasting thirty minutes and lasting thirty days, in an ultimate sense.  To really move beyond this weakness, we need to make a radical move that takes radical determination, knowing that it will ultimately lead to radical results and incredible happiness.

(3) **Take it one day at a time** (and sometimes just one hour or one minute at a time, I think committing for life is a must.  But visualizing that whole lifespan, especially in a moment of temptation, will likely lead to despair and to relapse.  Focus on victory in the present moment.  ""Sufficient for a day [or millisecond, depending] is its own evil.""  And celebrate those small victories.  You'll be rightly proud if you can survive those moments.  Smile--you've earned it (and see #5 below).

(4) **Hard-mode or bust.**  Now obviously, the problem with pornography, with using women on the internet, isn't the ""on the internet"" part, but is rather the ""using women"" part.  Overcoming our addictions to doing that solo--either via visual stimuli or mental fantasies--is huge.  But it's a meaningless battle if I then head to a party a hook up with a hot stranger / acquaintance.  I'll have essentially just subbed her vagina for my hand, with the same perverse and self-centered purpose.  That is, in some ways, because it completely demeans her while also keeping me solidly lodged in the same filth I've been stuck in all along on my own.

(5) **Smile.**  Yes, scratch that--you ARE so much better because of it, even in the midst of the battle.  You may not feel great yet, but you will.  You should be incredibly proud of yourself.  Don't take yourself too seriously throughout the process, even though obviously this is a serious matter.  Live life.  Do other things.  Enjoy yourself.  Thrive.  Smile.

(6) **Don't fetishize the counter.**  It's a great tool.  We need internal and external motivators as men, and that's counterproductive beyond belief.

(7) **Serve others.**  Maybe that means supporting each other on here, since masturbation works by closing you in on yourself.  In learning generosity, we equip ourselves to slay this beast.

(8) Finally--and I acknowledge off the bat that this one is particularly Catholic and will be received variously from various vantage points, at the risk of being really crude, instead of spending time hand-to-dick, spend it knee-to-floor.  Gaze on that crucifix, knowing that if he could do that on Good Friday for love of you, you can absolutely do this for love of him.  Pray to the Immaculate Heart of Our Lady, who is such a crucial ally in this battle for purity.  Ask the Saints to intercede for you, and just waste time with God in his salvific presence.  He'll transform you into the best man you can be

In closing, regardless of your sex or your religion or your age or your history or whatever else: YOU CAN ABSOLUTELY DO THIS.  I stand before you (still broken in all sorts of respects, of course, but) free of this, and so immensely happy as a result.  There is a better life for you beyond this.  Never ever doubt that.

Peace to you all.  Fight on!

Proud to be standing shoulder-to-shoulder with you in this noble battle

He is there and looks nice, still excited to spend some time with him, and you're having a really nice time

I'd like to give back to this community by sharing a simple philosophy that has brought me plenty of success in that department.

Who am I? Just a guy who's recently come to the realization that he was carrying an addiction to porn and fapping that has contributed to countless missed opportunities. I've finally decided to do something about it. Unlike many in this group though, so I've developed an addiction to it. I now believe that it's in part responsible for ruining some potentially great relationship I might have had.

First of, this philosophy doesn't require that you'd have a sense of humour or that you'd be witty. It simply relies on your willingness to do one thing that 90% of other guys won't do, approach women. I call this  *planting the seed of possibilities*. You'll understand why in a moment.

This is just one way to meet girls among many

I will now share 3 true life situations that have happened to me at separate periods in my life. There have been many others that have gone similary

Once upon a time, she thanked me for the invitation, but told me she had a boyfriend.

Another time, but had never talked to. One day, I went to ask her some beauty advices for men, as she started with her explanations, I interrupted her and confessed that I had just cooked up an excuse to talk to her and that I just wanted a chance to invite her out. She was flattered, but she had a boyfriend. 

Yet another time, I laughed and she asked who was the girl, I told her to guess. She guessed, she was flattered, but she had a boyfriend. 
I think you start to see the pattern.

Now, I remained polite and welcoming. I would greet them with a genuine smile, inquired about how they were doing and acted as if nothing had ever happened before. It was as if to me, it was just business as usual, I had asked them out, they had said no to my proposal and I'd now moved on with my life. No drama, no big deal. 

Interestingly enough

Sometimes a girl has no idea that you exist and therefore has no opinion of you. She doesn't like you

What she doesn't know though is that it's too late, she starts pondering about you. She wonders if she finds you attractive, weird, quirky, ugly. She wonders if it could just be casual, formal, long term, she finds you kinda cute. Maybe if she could just get you to change the way you dress or your haircut. She wonders why you don't seem more affected by her rejection. Could you have found someone new? Do you still think she's cute? By now she's asked a friend or a coworker to check you out and they've agreed that you're not bad looking. She wonders if you're going to make another move

Obviously, she isn't, but provided that you've made some minimal efforts to look presentable, you stand some good chances to take your cause into appeal.

###EVERYTHING MAKES US WANT TO FAP!

##And because of this reason it’s time for some men to step up. Why?

1.	**You can achieve a level of self control like never before**; no generation before us has experienced this level of sexual temptation like us
2.	**You’ll become a highly sexually energized  individual**; which is actually good thing
3.	**You will lose that weird “fap/porn addict awkwardness”  vibe forever when talking with another woman**  (And it’s not because you’re an introvert

Talk to people who haven’t fapped nor watched porn atleast 5 months!  They are excited about life!  They are reaching their full human potential and are able to do what most men aren’t!  They now have the discipline to “work from home” if they want to; because they know they aren’t going to blow half their day on some lame porn site!  This happiness

##This is what is going to happen with you during NoFap

-	You are going to stop fapping, your assignments, because the only thing that you are going to be thinking about is fapping.  NoFAPPING

-	Eventually, you will walk down the halls and no women are interested, nobody cares; and you don’t care about anything, you don’t care about sex, and you don’t really care about any goals. **During this phase, you discover that without your sex drive, you have no passion in life**

-	This phase ends; and then your sex drive returns, you want to meet real women, and you still can’t concentrate because you want to meet real women; this phase passes. Kind of.  In the sense that, **DURING THIS PHASE, FAPPING HAS BEEN ELIMINATED FROM YOUR BRAIN AS AN OPTION.**; Whether it's your wife, girlfriend, or a girl you are trying to get with; you have to make it happen, you're screwed

-	Eventually, become more passionate about your job, you’ll quit other addictions, you will want to eat better.

-	You will feel better, and the percentage of women that are attracted to you will go up TENFOLD.  Maybe not like grown up Justin Bieber, “Omg marry me because you’re hot and rich, please have my babies” ; but more like “Hmm…if I really analyze my feelings, this guy is one of the most all around attractive guys I personally know”, type of attraction.

1.	Your personality will be more magnetic than before
2.	You will tap into your leadership more than before
3.	Interacting with the opposite sex will feel more like a necessity (if that’s your goal)

Basically don’t quit

The question I was asked was familiar to most of us.  ""I keep relapsing... I think about sex all the time... I have to fap just to be able to move on to more productive things... what is your secret?""

There are three important things that help keep me on track.  ""Secrets""

The first one is accountability.  There are three people who know what I am doing, and it is an instant urge-killer.

The second important thing is to call a spade a spade.  Get real:  When your brain tells you ""just get it over with and fap so you can be productive""

Because this IS an addiction.  Whether you want to call it addiction to porn, whatever... your brain desperately wants the dopamine hit that rubbing one out will give you, and it will tell you anything to get you to go ahead and submit.  Don't be a bitch.  Don't fall for such an obvious sell.

The third ""secret"" is good old fashioned machismo.  Put that bottled up testosterone to its proper use:  Man the fuck up.  Take control back from your addiction.  Every day I add a number to my counter is a day I FUCKING WIN.  Sometimes it is easy.  Sometimes I feel like I went through a heavyweight bout.  But I win.  Every.  God.  Damn.  Day.  And I never want to stop winning.  I imagine going to bed defeated.  My will broken.  My manhood slowly soaking through a soggy tissue.  My badge grinning at me like a bitch.

As you can see by my flair, my son, you were quite the stud in your young life.  So very many accolades.  Somewhere along the way, you seemed to quit believing in yourself.  I think it would be good for you to go through this file and see what you were and still are capable of.""

I replied that I already knew I was a failure, but I just couldn't, and it would break her heart.  Of course, she's a mom, so she said I could tell her anything.  I decided to honey badger this shit and just lay it on her.  So I wrote a long email, and then texted her to get Dad and go read it in their bedroom (relatives live with them, don't want them involved).  In the hope that I can inspire other fapstronauts to get over their fear of involving loved ones in this transformation, my family isn't shy with the cussing

-----------------------

What changed?  It wasn't really ""an event"", but I'd recommend that you are sitting down when you read this, because it's gonna hurt.

So I was much like most teenagers.  When it came to sex though, without grossing my out too much, I'm sure you've seen porn before.  Porn is not sex.  But it is a sex substitute.  I was quickly able to get a hold of a lot of porn.  Teenagers are horny, they masturbate a lot, and in these days, they watch porn.  So what?

Well, awkward, and then felt extremely weird afterward.  I'm sure you're familiar with the limited talks I had with you guys about sex - ""Wear a rubber"" was about the only advice Dad had for me.  Thankfully, I did follow that.

So I had sex a couple times

The next time I tried to have sex (at 17 years old), but holy shit was that a confidence killer.  The girl was really hot, I really liked her, there was no reason for things not to work.  But I wasn't really turned on.  It was sort of meh.  So that sucked, but I didn't give up.  I tried again - fail.  I tried again - fail.  I never tried again until college, because I thought college would solve my problems.  It didn't.

I met some girls at college.  Went on some dates.  Tried sex a couple of times - it didn't work.  So I retreated.  You know when I could keep an erection?   Watching porn.  So I went deep down the rabbit hole, 3, 4 times/day.  Why do you think I dropped out of college?  You didn't honestly think it was just drugs and alcohol, did you?  I could skate through classes like it was nobodies business.  But I started staying home from class because my roommate was gone then, so I could watch porn.  It became what I did to pass time, when I was nervous, when I was tired, when I was excited

Remember that girl **** that I dated?  Why do you think we broke up?  Ugh, and wasn't going to wait around for a guy that couldn't get his dick to work properly.  That was pretty much the final shot for me.  I gave up.

Do you have any idea what life is like if you know (I know that's wrong, travel the world, have fun, and share it with a significan other.  Well, all of that was out the window.  I had no prospects for my future.  I tried to fill the void - I thought I could work myself through it, that didn't help.  I thought I could drug myself through it, that didn't help.  I thought setting big external goals like going to law school would help, I was miserable.  I was working a shit job only because my mom had got it for me

At this point, that didn't happen.  Working from home only made it easier.  And with all the self doubt I had from this shit, I just kept feeding it.  Even when I was completely in control of my own life, I'd just waste the entire day in bed, hating myself, hating my life, hating what I had come to.  I made enough money to get by

Now

Somehow though, literally.  I'd cycle through porn and masturbation, smoking weed and browsing the internet, and crying myself back to sleep.  EVERYTHING in my life is because of this.

It's why I don't do anything with my life.  It's why I don't do stand up comedy, I'm just not evil enough to only want money in life.  What's the point of having money if you can't spend it on taking a beautiful girl out to dinner because you know you can't take her home later?  You know why I quit playing soccer?  That abdominal pain I have? Its from ruining my pelvic muscles with constant masturbation.  I'm ruining myself, body and mind.

But, in the last year, I've discovered that I'm not alone, not at all - thousands of young men from all walks of life are currently in the same prison.  I really didn't think anyone else could possibly live this life and not kill themselves.  It's so horrible.  It's not a regular addiction like cigarettes or booze or drugs.  It's not something I can announce on facebook: ""Two days without porn everyone! Yay me!""  It's a prison that no one can see.  And, worst of all, it is completely free.  I don't have to rob or steal to get my fix, I just have to keep paying my comcast bill.  Speaking of that, and he recommended that I just settle

But like I said

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSF82AwSDiU - The Great Porn Experiment - a TED talk by the leading researcher on this stuff.

www.yourbrainonporn.com - Information

www.reddit.com/r/nofap - Where I'm going for support to try to get out of this.  It's semi-anonymous which helps me be open.

Most people that have successfully beat this problem go through the following phases: The tough initial stage (1-7 days), a flat-line where you have 0 libido (at any time, usually only lasts a couple of weeks), and then it gets better, the libido comes charging back, the ED is gone, and sex is pleasurable again.  They advocate a no-PMO lifestyle (no Porn, or Orgasm).  This is only until you have rewired your brain to enjoy natural sex and respond to it appropriately.  Masturbation is not the demon

I've tried to quit this horrible, but whenever we go on family vacation, I'm usually pretty miserable on days 2-4.  Those are the days that I'm adjusting to not getting my fix.  I usually want to kill somebody when I wake up, but as the day goes along, and if we stay busy enough, I get through it.  But as soon as I get back home, it's right back to where I left off.

I've thought about asking my brothers for help, as I know others have speculated.  Well, I tried it out once, it didn't do it for me.  I told dad once that I was having erection problems, and he told me to go to the doctor.  I did, and he told me its nothing physical (I knew that, because I could easily get an erection with porn).  I even went to a psychologist for a bit, and it seemed like I knew as much as he did (why do you think I took psychology classes in college?).

So there it is Ma.  That is what happened to me.  I don't think you can possibly comprehend the look on a girls face when she's begging you to fuck her and all you can say is ""I can't right now.""  I don't think you have any idea what it feels like to expect your life to be unfulfilling forever.  It's extremely hard to pursue your goals if you know you'll never be able to share them with anybody.  And please don't tell me that if I found the right girl, with bad girls, with girls I love, with girls I don't care about, even some morally unpopular choices - I was doing anything I could try to get a response.  But none of it mattered, and I'd just come home to watch more porn.

I know I've been a disappointment.  I don't want to be.  I want to change.  I'm trying, now I'm asking for help.  Nothing specific, I don't even know how you possibly could help, but there will likely be a time in the next couple of months (if I stick with it), where I'm going to need help.

I can't wait to get past this.  I know I'm more than the person I have become.  I'm sooooo much more.  But I can't be that while I'm trapped in this self-imposed prison.  You're right - I want to fly.  But I'm a bird in a cage.  I'm trying to pry the fucking door open with one hand

You don't need to write back.  We can talk about this when we have lunch.  I don't know how I'm going to be able to look you in the eye at dinner Friday night.  But you wanted to know, like to drink and smoke pot, but so does everyone.  I don't even do either of those very much anymore.  My problem has always been the PMO addiction cycle.  Please watch the video so you can understand how hard this cycle is to break.

Yesterday, and I will, I just have to stick with it.

We've had sex nearly every night and he's gotten much more creative with it. This was his decision - I didn't pressure him into it. The thing is... I notice more girls checking him out! Just makes me proud to be with him. He pays more attention to me. He's kept me updated willingly because he seems quite proud of his accomplishment.

Frankly

I have to say that my objective was the following: Nofap noporn

First fews days were awful (I thought at that time).  I felt pressure in my body and my mind.  Already a big ""sex thinker""

After 5 or 6 days, I decided to give my opinion about a wine a girl was holding in her hand, something I wouldn't normally do.  Guess what, it ended up with a phone number.

My eye contacts with girls was sharp. Smiling to them became normal.  The day after in the subway, smiling, making jokes.  Always looking at her, I felt she was somehow interested, touching my arm, brushing her breast ""accidently"" on my arms, signs that don't lie.  Guess what: Phone number.

On friday I went to a bar with 3 friends.  I saw a superb Lebanese girl with the dream shape.  Again, confidence.  But this time, instead of letting her go - what guys almost always do - I went to her and told her that I liked how she was dressed, that she had a lot of style.  Short discussion.  Guess what: phone number.

On sunday (7 days without porn / fap ) I went for a coffee with a old ""flame"" from college.  2 hours later, I was in total control with a non stop incredible erection.  Then the orgasm came.  The longest most powerful thing I've never experienced.  I think it lasted 30 seconds. And the erection was not gone.  I have to say - and this not bragging - my friend was very impressed.  Me even more than her.

It now has been 30 days with no fap / porn and I've never felt more confident in my life.  And the results are there.  All this is not theoretical.  I met more girls in the last month that in the last year and you know why ?  Because it's the only option. Because I now know I have nothing to loose.

Bottom line: Guys: Stop wasting your sexual energy on porn and fap.  You just can't imagine what's hidding behind it.  Most girls will confirm the following principle: they prefer confidence and humor than appearence.  You think you're not sexy enough to experience what I just did ?  You - are - wrong.  Try it.  It is in you.  Now I know it.

So instead of spending nights on youporn

What people don't realise is that this can't work out permanently. Sooner or later you'll just get used to that constant state of excitement
Even worse is that normal things will seem like a pest to you.

The good news? Your brains is dynamic. You can rewire it.
I'm sure you have a lot of pleasure you don't actually need.

For example
I didn't even like to drink water
Sugary drinks are not only unnecessary, caries, and other diseases.
It's just another unhealthy habit

Another thing is music. I've played the guitar for 10 years now. I love it and it has been a great part of my life ever since. BUT. Music is another source of pleasure. I used to get out my iPod when I went to work
at work (I'm in IT, when I went home, and at home. 
You'll eventually get to the point where you can't even enjoy it anymore. It will become an unspectacular part of your day. I've learned that I can enjoy a lot more since I've stopped listening to it as much.

My last example
I used to hate cold showers
We try to escape any discomfort. Now I love them!
They can improve your mood
More advantages can be better skin, and many many more.
They can also help you with Nofap, I'm talking about ice cold, as cold as possible.

**--My Nofap Background--**

Fapped since I was 13. Always hated how guilty it made me feel. I wanted to quit as soon as I started, I installed software, I even told my dad at one point. But always, my addiction was stronger than those bonds of trust, and by breaking them I was retreating into the secrecy and isolation that addiction thrives on. 





**--How I broke the cycle--**

I knew this time would be different from the start. I felt differently about it. What worked for me was that nofap encourages you to aspire to an ideal, Churchill, Jesus, Muhammad, Mandela) are made of. Every inspirational speech you've ever heard is based solely on this idea - to aspire to be a human being made of principle, not one who sells themselves out for gain or pleasure. 

This is what drove me to beat the addiction - because I believed in it 100%. Despite all of this, I was telling myself these exact words. *""You have worked far too hard to get to this point to piss it all away now.""* And it was true. Find something that you really believe in and use it to your advantage. If I can reach 90 days, literally anyone can. 





**--The benefits--**

First off, I feel pride. Instead of guilt about the past, I feel determination about the future. I won't get everything right, but at least I will try. I was so scared of offending girls that I wouldn't even tell them I liked them. In fact, I've found that people find it much easier to relate to you and respect you if you make no apologies for being yourself, even when you get things wrong. Even if they don't fancy you, they'll respect the fuck out of you for having the balls to talk to them.

There's also been physical benefits. My penis felt different around day 25, but I've yet to get one from merely looking at a girl. 

I also have more time, and if I can't get out with my friends I get out alone, and do stuff.





**--Bad things

First thing, but trying and learning from your mistakes is better. Just don't take liberties when giving yourself leeway for failure.

I didn't get superpowers. I doubt their existence. I had moments of social awkwardness and awesomeness before, accidentally take advantage of a drunk friend (by kissing her, thanks to lilychaud for demanding clarification) because I didn't realise how drunk she was, and then embarrass myself by telling her and finding out she had no recollection of it, and didn't like me in that way, and fail to ask a girl I really like out in our last week of term. But hey, I also managed to get chatted up by a girl who approached me at the airport





**--My tips--**

* You edge

* Learn to be happy with losing. If you tried

* Never give up. Even now,False,,t5_2skrn,1374759984.0,,under1,t3_1j0tnl

1361024886.0,18mz8f,"For over the past year, NoFap was all about attracting women, being ""alpha""/dominant, erasing social anxiety, boosting confidence, etc.. Due to a set of circumstances and personal experiences,111, and for this post

As the title suggests, and I wasn't nearly as forward thinking as I am now. I've currently been 100% No PMO for about the past 2 and a half months. I'm feeling great, as expected... but there's some things I'd like to address..

I've been focusing A LOT lately on becoming more confident, becoming the alpha male, picking up chicks, and everything else in this category. I've come to the realization that I always look for validation everywhere I go. Not by impressing people, but rather, I always look around myself to see which women are checking me out. If I get checked out, ego boost. If I don't

I've been focusing a lot on my body language

A series of circumstances and experiences shed MASSIVE amounts of light on this situation for me. I've been stressing in particular about this whole ""becoming alpha"" thing A LOT these past 2 weeks. I

I've read about ""sexual transmutation"" plenty of times on here and other places. It's where you transmute, but SO worth it.) 

Anyways

Instead, with a woman unless she is your girlfriend. Also firmly declare that you will NOT make a woman your girlfriend unless you and her connect 100% and are POSITIVE that she's the one for you during this period of your life. DO NOT just date a giarl because she's attractive, popular, or something else. A girl that you date for those superficial qualities will not bring you what you need in your life at this time to advance you to your next stage. You need a woman (or a boyfriend, if you're female/gay), that shares the same interests, that you vibe with COMPLETELY

I noticed that whenever I hook up with a really attractive woman of high social status

Here's where the secret to all of this comes in : 

1.) If you're not staring at every woman that you see - because you find her attractive and want to fuck her - your confidence is going to naturally shoot EXTREMELY high, or how much cleavage she's showing.. You've already declared in your mind that you will not have sex with ANY of these women, and you mean it. They are COMPLETELY off the list as far as sexual relations goes. After that initial social pressure of trying to attract a mate is gone, you can be yourself COMPLETELY, because it doesn't matter what they think of you, whether they like you or not after that. 

2.) When you DO finally get an amazing girlfriend that is PERFECT for you, or a girl I like a lot, or a girl that has high social status, I feel extremely confident because I have become ""validated"" in their eyes.. I was worthy. When you have an awesome girlfriend, you have this all the time. You are validated with her. She is yours, you are hers.. Nothing else. 

In short, for THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. 

You will no longer be looking to impress girls. The one girl that you click with 100% that you don't HAVE to try to impress, and these are the pieces required to develop the most confidence a human being can attain. 

Keep in mind.. When you stop paying attention to girls because you will not be sexual with them, or you will end up right back at the bottom of the pit.

LAST BUT NOT LEAST - you must TRANSMUTE the sexual energy. Don't just refrain from sex or gawking at women. Actually USE this new energy to make yourself successful, and every other good quality you could attain. The ""Think and Grow Rich"" chapter I posted above will describe in more detail how to do this..

**TL;DR: There is no TLDR. You must read the whole thing. If you don't, and THINK about it. Those that are ready to receive this will understand it. Those who aren't ready, will downvote it, and eventually find it a later date :)**

Because it gave him a clear-cut negative aspect of his life to conquer, he was weak, but he bested himself and that instilled a sense of success and triumph in his life.

Others have the good fortune of never experiencing an addiction in their life; they have their shit together. But those who are addicted live in a state of chaos. Their spirits are weak.

1364394377.0,1b402j,I'm a 23 year old porn addict. I just discovered I have ED after sleeping with a beautiful girl.,towonderland,387,51,148,"I started masturbating when I was 10. I was really computer savvy since I was a little kid and I quickly discovered how internet porn worked.

When I was 12 I had an experience of cuddling/dry humping with a female friend. This turned me on like crazy and I became obsessed with the feeling of sexual pleasure.

I grew up through private Catholic schools, and porn helped me feel good. This had been my attitude for the last 12 or so years.

The extent of my addiction wasn't apparent to me until 3 days ago

I masturbated a lot to porn. I would find different scenes and images and things that turned me on in the right way. My masturbation technique is a little odd as well, I think I am worried about having done permanent sensitivity damage from years of this--I haven't heard of of anybody who masturbates like this so idk if there's anybody out there who can relate and tell me if this was damaging).

Throughout my teens I felt the affects of becoming more isolated, I would become nervous and not be myself.

This continued throughout college. I gave up on relationships about halfway through college

Throughout all of these years I masturbated probably 10 times a week. Some days as many as 4 times. I never stopped really; when I went on trips I would maybe stop for a couple days at most and then go right back to it. I would experiment -- I have come anally at least 10-15 times in my life

Recently I met this beautiful girl whom I had strong feelings for. I wanted to become lovers. I felt this strong attraction. We ended up staying at a hotel for 2 nights and getting really comfortable with each other.

We ended up cuddling and I was rock hard at first

We cuddled for a really

Later on

From years of my internet porn use I thought that I had a huge libido

I went to the bathroom and tried to masturbate to get to a full erection. I could seriously not do it. It would get to like 45% at most and quickly die. I eventually returned to the bed feeling the irony of obsessing over sex and women for a decade and here I was with this beautiful girl right in front of me and I couldn't feel anything down there.

That was 3 days ago. I haven't gotten an erection since. I decided on my way home that I would not look at porn ever again. I got online and googled for ED in young men. I found this and yourbrainonporn. Reading some of the other people's testimonies on this clicked in my head. I feel awake and alive now. I feel like (some) of my social anxiety and depression is due to my porn addiction. I didn't even realize how much harm I was causing to my body. I have absolutely no idea how long it is going to take to become cured of this (if ever). I only hope I haven't done permanent damage.

That said I feel pretty good that I realized I had this issue. I'm glad I wasn't drunk/high or anything when I was with this girl because then I might have blamed the problem on that. 

I want to see this girl again but as the relationship is a long-distance thing

I haven't yet told her about this realization but I will at the first opportunity. If she things I am too much baggage (long distance relationship w/ sexual issues) then I am perfectly OK with that + I will thank her for making me become aware of my problem.

If she still wants to be with me

1368790626.0,1eifre,My Day 365 NoFap Report,DRayG,377,51,261,"**Possible triggers** 

**How it started** 
   The first time I viewed porn was at the age of four. My parents were in the kitchen cooking breakfast, and told me to stop. 

   I didn't see porn again till age 6. I asked my mom to find a Power Rangers movie among unmarked VHS. She found it

   My porn addiction truly began one night in 2006. My family just purchased HBO. I fell asleep round 9:30 and woke up to the moans Rebecca Love's Ghost in a Teeny Bikini around 1 A.M. The next thing I know I had the biggest erection of my life and then I ejaculated. 

   This led me to streaming GGW previews for a few months until I downloaded Limewire. I remember masturbating to a GGW dorm video before school for months. 
 
   At 14 (2008) I received a new computer than could run anything I wanted to watch. I began to visit multiple websites daily. At first it was boy/girl &amp; girl/girl and within a year I was reading hentai and incest comics. 

   By May 2012 I was watching 1-2 hours of porn a day

**What I caused on myself**
     My addiction caused me to be extremely lethargic and introverted. Making eye contact while speaking became a challenge and spending all day playing CoD4/WoW was my life. I'd get home at 2:30 and wouldn't say a word to any one. My grades began to go down hill. I once was a straight A student

**How I found NoFap**
   I used to post heavily on a music forum

**How I didn't relaspe**
   In the first 90 days I just read NoFap/YBOP daily. Reading success stories along with knowing how I was before kept me from wanting to go back. I also didn't set a unreachable goal. I never said to myself I'll do a year. I just kept adding 90 days.

**How I changed** 
   I wake up every day happy to see a new day. I know I don't have this black cloud over me now. I'm much more confident. I can walk with my head up, friendly, and open now. I can see a problem and think about how to solve it instead of running away from it.

   I workout 7 days a week now. The feeling is great

   I still try to go church just to see other view points. There is no more brain fog either. My erections and stronger in the morning

   The most important change was me learning to love and accept myself. Sure I'm 5'5 and sweat even when I'm cold

I'm still a kissless virgin

1367652766.0,1do3jb,You are NOT in Control.,KevAlex10,370,42,114," Hey guys

 As you can see, I work a good-paying programming job, I'm musically talented and such, etc. (Not trying to brag). But I for the LIFE of me can't seem to get laid. I go to clubs, parties, hangouts with friends, and I've been much more alpha and confident lately with girls but I can't seem the get the RELEASE I seek so badly

 It then hit me.. This goes beyond NoFap. This is a life lesson. I have to learn to be cool with not being in control all the time, fapping breeds this selfish and spoiled entitled attitude that when you want something, you need to have it satisfied NOW. If I'm horny, easy, just jack off. But you see, that's the easy way out. You become an apathetic piece of shit who can't work hard for anything meaningful in life.

I've read many posts about married people here, and it can be applied to anything else. Somethings are just NOT in your control and we have to accept it. I recently learned that Life (and everything else) is like a roller coaster. Once you are strapped in, and the coaster is moving, there is absolutely NOTHING you can do to stop it from going it's path. You can flail your arms in fear, scream, and cry, OR you can sit back and enjoy the ride.

What IS in our control? Well, workout, we can control our habits, go out become successful, make something of ourselves, but that doesn't guaranteed you'll get laid WHEN and WHERE you want it. We have to accept the fact that real women are not objects to be there at our whim. That we have to actually get our shit together as men to be the men women want. 

 I really just want to FUCK some girl right now, I CAN and need to control my desires and just accept the fact that there are just some things that are out of my control.

Eckhart Tolle once said something along the lines ""The moment you accept the fact that you are not at peace

Think on that for a second..

They are so much more beautiful if you think of them more than just something you want to have sex with.  Look at their faces and the wonderful way they communicate with you in so many non-verbal ways.  Women light up all of my senses.  They are experts in communication I have lacked in so much of my shy and anxious life.  Porn perverts so much more about how truly wonderful and beautiful women are.

Look at the beautiful women, you will find one you can't live without.  When you have your one, marry her, and never let her go.  Tell her how much you love her every day.

I have my one, but my wife the most gorgeous women I have ever seen .  She lights my life in so many ways, and I can't wait to get home to see her.

How awesome would it be to wake up on Christmas morning and be at 90 days?! We could maybe post ideas of how we could reward ourselves with a special gift or something that morning. Or maybe that is just retarded. Ideas?

I've noticed that some people would like to have accountability, but that strikes me as a more personal thing that people can figure out on their own. It seems likely though that there will be several people in this challenge who want something like that, so just talk amongst yourselves. Here is the list so far; If I forgot you, or added you by mistake, just message me.

**EDIT 2:** Alright, and don't forget to **encourage one another!** Together we can do this, and have a great start to not only the next year, but the rest of our lives!! If there is further interest, perhaps more people can start another Christmas Challenge, and we can compete against one another.

We have been together for a while, even though I admire you, you are beginning to get on my nerves a bit.



Yes, you would surely give me a call and say ""hey mate, great ladies at this party, come around"". But no, you take a video and you show them to me, to rub it in my face that you get to know them and that I need to be content with the second hand smoke of sexuality. That is not nice on your part.



Besides, you must be kidding me...



Also, in front on my fucking screen, fantasizing about what I will never get to have, getting familiar with my dick as I zone out into nothingness, thinking ""wouldn't it be wonderful if I could be with that goddess?"" ""I will never be able to meet someone as hot as her"" ""why don't I get to know and experience that type of sex""...



You know what? Fuck you. Fuck you, and have amazing sex, but you know what, they are REAL women. They do not follow a script. They do as they please, and they do not charge me. The problem is that every minute I spend with your fucking bullshit, it is a minute I am not employing in my business or with my REAL women. I am fucking wasting my amazing life away with you.



Besides... every minute I spend with you I am more miserable. I stop believing in reality and I miss your faked, youuuu, you... you make me confused about what is real.



Fuck you, their struggles, their sexuality. I am sure they fart and can laugh about it. I am sure of it because I have known enough women already, and somehow nobody is enough because I let you trick me into believing that women are something else. Something beyond human, something to cater to my fantasies, fed by you, manipulative tyrant bastard.



I am done with you. I hate you. I gave away my fucking freedom to you. I gave you the key to define my sexual desires and expectations. I gave you permission to walk uninterrupted in my beliefs about relationships. I let you paint a picture of femininity and I ran by it. I gave you more authority over me that I ever gave my parents



Get the fuck away. You want to make your money by hacking into my brain and the brains of my fellow men. You want the men of the world to be chronic masturbators



You know what? Even if that is true. Even if sometimes I just want to squeeze a good pair of boobs and chew those nipples to the point of ecstasy... Fuck you. Any real pair of boobs is miles away from your 2D unreal ones. Any real woman is worth a thousand of your tricks.



I will never, remember specifically THAT one? Oh that was memorable..."" But I can remember every real woman I have ever been with. Even the bad crazy bitchy stupid ones. Even the ones I didn't love, I remember THEM. They were R E A L.



So fuck you very much and get away, abusive, immoral fucker. I am done with you and I hate you for all the hours I have wasted dancing to your fucking song.



I hope you fucking die alone, masturbating to your HD screen and a box of viagra, with nobody with you in bed, not knowing what to do with the love you never had.



I really, former master. I was your slave for way too many years. I am gonna wait until my REAL girlfriend is back from holidays and I am gonna fuck her to oblivion in your honor. And with each orgasm I hope you feel more, and more, and more alone.



You have done nothing for men in this fucking world, and a hottie with a good pair of silicon boobs a g-string connecting the wire to the plug as your balls fry. There. For all the sperm wasted in your name. Burn, motherfucker. Burn.

this is my first post and I've gone 44 days without PMO. Like most people I started watching porn at the age of 13 or 14. Since then

Today it's my 21st birthday. My social anxiety forced me to stay at my college dormitory most of the time and even when some social event came up, I got to study, exams coming up soon"". But I never studied, I was lying to the people and to myself, I was looking forward to the prospect of me being alone at the dorm and I just fapped to porn till I had enough. And even if I went to a social event, my social anxiety blocked my speech and I was unable to make the first contact, especially to the girls. I'm 21 years old now and I've never had a girlfriend

**MY JOURNEY:**
==
**1ST WEEK:**
The first week was certainly the hardest. There were many temptations on the second day

I was reading a lot of the stories here on reddit and yourbrainonporn.com. The stories increased my motivation and determination to get through the challenge effortlessly.

On day 5 I noticed my confidence got UP and when I went shopping

On day 7 I was having a lunch with my family in a restaurant and I told them a good joke and all of us had a good laugh. I was really surprised at my behaviour. I never told jokes before.

**2ND WEEK:**
I was more positive and confident. I started exercising - running on a elliptical machine

I broke my life-record. I did 85 push-ups, then rested for a minute, again 20 push-ups, rested, and so on. I never thought I could do so many.

On day 11 - I caught myself starting a small talk with the receptionist at my college dorm.

On day 12 - I contacted my two friends from high-school

Day 14 - I almost relapsed because I went online to chat with people and after several minutes it led to a sexting, got dressed and went out to see my grandparents at their cottage. At least I was in the company of people and that brought the urges down.

**3RD WEEK:**
I started wearing contact lenses, basically I was the one leading the conversations.

I saw a movie “The Pursuit of Happyness” with Will Smith starring - I can highly recommend it! Inspirational and motivational at the same time.

On day 21 I was feeling a bit depressed and moody. I started exercising to lift my mood and it really helped.

**4TH WEEK:**

While studying I am also an intern in one company, irrational. I did a lot of thinking.

My sister asked to go party with her and meet her friends. So I DID go with her and had a great time meeting amazing people. The next day my sister told me I was pretty cool at the party. I was saying hi to the people first. I was the initiator of many conversations and people practically liked me.

**5TH WEEK:**

My will to do things increased tremendously. When I want to do something

**6TH WEEK:**

Totally by accident I spilled a cup of coffee all over the floor. Funny thing happened. It didn’t make me angry or anything. I just laughed at myself being clumsy and went back to having a good time. 

I learned that it is us who make the decisions

On day 40 I was so energetic and happy. Before I was even anxious to make a simple phone call. Now I’m not afraid anymore. I just stepped out of my comfort zone!

On day 42 my sister asked me if I want to go to a music festival with her and her friends. I said YES. It will be great to get out of the house. I will be sleeping in a tent. I haven’t done than in years. I’m so looking forward to it. I might meet some cool girls there.

**7TH WEEK - NOW!**

Today on July 22nd it’s been 44 days. I am doing extremely fine. I’ve been reading a lot, watching meaningful movies, going out meeting people (more than before), smiling a lot.

The great thing is that I’m not afraid to travel anymore. Now I just get on the train and go somewhere.

I must say that my life has changed so much in the last 44 days and the first person I would like to thank is Mr Zimbardo, found yourbrainonporn site and eventually this reddit. So thank you every one!
 

### Books I must recommend:

* The Demise of Guys - Zimbardo - he talks about the effects of porn and computer games on the human brain

* The Four Agreements - Miguel Ruiz - this book changed my life as well. It describes why we do what we do. It changes your view of the world.

* Think and Grow Rich - Napoleon Hill - another great book
[http://www.sacred-texts.com/nth/tgr/tgr16.htm](http://www.sacred-texts.com/nth/tgr/tgr16.htm)

Then read any books you want to increase your vocabulary



### Activities that helped me get through the first days:

* Exercising - running on a treadmill for at least 40 minutes.
* Doing push-ups and sit-ups
* Boxing - this was really helpful and effective. Recommended for everyone.
* Reading books - reading personal growth books always cheered me up
* Getting out of the house
* Reading famous quotes (there are many motivational quotes)
* Contacting friends you haven’t seen in a long time
* Watching meaningful movies - The Pursuit of Happyness, Yes Man (Jim Carrey comedy)
* Read something about positive thinking :) When I was feeling angry or just low
* Do something you wanted to do for years. I learned to tie a tie for example :) I never knew how to do that
* Learn languages :) I started learning French and have been making good progress already :)
* Make others feel special by giving compliments
* Stop using Facebook
* Learn how to dance - girls will appreciate that!
* Be proactive as much as possible - take responsibility for your actions :)
* A lot of people recommend taking a cold shower when having urges :)
* Get out of your comfort zone as much as possible! [Here are some tips.](http://personalexcellence.co/blog/ask-celes-comfort-zone/)
* Learn to cook some delicious meals. Not only will it make your mood better because you've learned something new
* Get better at non-verbal communication - this is really useful. I mean it's so great when you talk to someone and you spot microexpressions on their faces. You can see their mood (happiness, you can see if they disagree with you but are afraid to tell you :) To be good at non-verbal communication, I recommend watching the TV Series Lie to Me, which is based on the actual research of a psychologist Paul Ekman and it's 90 % accurate :)

**I think the KEY to my SUCCESS and why I managed to go 44 days without any major problems is the realization of the effects the porn has on your brain. When you understand what happens to the brain

That of course doesn't mean I will stop. I have committed myself to do NOFAP my whole life. I will make my uture girlfriend really happy. I can already see my future without any relapses.

I will write an update when I reach the day 90 and tell you about what's new and what happened in my life :)

1343571453.0,xcbhv,Six Things To Keep In Mind,salem2474,381,66,83,"Been in a bit of a funk for a month (not related to no-fap). Had a revelation last night watching the new batman movie. It was a bit incoherent

I came up with a list of six things that most modern men don't do consistently well. They aren't all related to strength. Here's the list/mantra. I explain each point below.

* Sleep
* Eat
* Lift
* Work
* Love
* Breathe

Do these six things right

###Sleep
----

How many hours did you sleep last night? For the past month

It takes its toll. We can function without enough sleep

This affects everything else on the list. If you aren't sleeping well, you won't be able to work well, etc.

And for those of you struggling with the temptation to fap

###Eat
----

Can you see your abs? 

If not, but the fact that your body carries excess fat is a sign you're not eating the way you should be. 

Eat right

If you're like most western men, sugary foods are bad for you. 

So why are you still eating them? 

I've gone off my weightlifting diet plan this month

Enough. There are plenty of delicious foods that are good for you. Eat those instead.

###Lift
----

Your body was built to life heavy things. Go to the gym

Find a gym with barbells, deadlifts, overhead press, and chins ups are a decent starting routine, split between two workouts.

This is actually essential to reaching your potential. Your body will work better when you give it the physical resistance it craves.

This isn't about getting big (though you will get bigger). It's about getting *strong*. I look strong

Three times per week is a good amount. Starting Strength will teach you how to do the lifts

There is a reason I called this ""lift"" rather than ""exercise"". This is different than cardio

You get a constant feeling of energy and capacity. And several chronic pains simply melted away once my muscles regained their capacity. 

If you're skeptical

###Work
----

You know what you should be doing. There are certain tasks that

But you aren't doing them. Maybe they're boring. Maybe you're afraid you might fail.

I don't know why you aren't doing them. But you should start.

Make time for important work

###Love
----

This is especially pertinent for people on /r/nofap. A lot of us are damaged

We've been substituting PMO for real girls. If you're here

But subtraction isn't enough. You need to add someone to your life. Go out and find her.

You can start small. Just go say hi. 

###Breathe
----

This one may be the most surprising. You probably think you breathe just fine.

Put one hand on your chest

Your chest *shouldn't* move

This is called diaphragmatic breathing. It leads to more oxygen

Short

But for everyday life, through your stomach. 

Try it

I tried this in the subway last night, the details of the station. Breathing took me out of the world inside my head and put me back into the real world.

Breathe well

**note:**Eventually

###Conclusion
----

These aren't obviously related to fapping or porn addiction. But nofap is as much about self-improvement as anything. If you're here

It doesn't need to be complicated. Those six things cover most everything you'll really want to change

And if you have these things in order

I would fix them in this order:

1. Breathe
2. Sleep
3. Eat
4. Lift
5. Work
6. Love

Love is last because you must make yourself a worthy partner before you can rightfully ask for an awesome girl. The girl doesn't make you complete. You make yourself complete

You are not making yourself complete *in order to* get the girl. It's just a pleasant side effect. 

I was in a bit of a flatline until yesterday. Since breathing well and sleeping better last night

I've also felt a calm energy

Try it yourself.

Second longest attempt at NoFap

I usually get my groceries at this one place, this is not the right time"", ""she's busy and I shouldn't interrupt"" etc.

I go up to the register, we're not alone, what about this lady?"" ""What's the girl doing, should I just excuse myself and leave?"" and all kinds of bullshit that puts sticks in my wheels. I tell myself I have to make this count, before I pack all my groceries or she walks away from the register. Luckily she starts stacking tobacco into their dispenser so as far as concering her I'm in the green. Now I just need to pep myself into opening my goddamn mouth for once.

I finish packing, ""Excuse me"". She looks at me and I say ""I've been wondering for a while what your name is, could you tell me your name?"". ""Yes, I can tell you my name, it's T"". You know how in movies they tell you to smile? Well I'd be damned if I didn't smile like a champ the entire time, it just came so naturally. I continued ""hello T, my name is C"". I told her how I've been coming there for a good while and it's far more nicer knowing what the personnel's names are. She agreed and pointed with her finger towards her chest ""..and since we don't have name tags.."". Anyway, that's besides the point. I repeat her name again, so does she and I walk out feeling like a baws. Outside I'm almost shouting in joy and placed on my face is this big smile. It felt really empowering and releasing.

After doing this I realised how utterly nonsensical and baseless fear and anxiety are when it comes to talking to strangers. I did this entirely for myself and no matter what will come from our next meetings I don't care if I get rejected. I talked to her, smiled and looked her straight in the eyes. I walked out back straight and I planted that seed of possibility. Who knows what will come, maybe we'll just chat once in a while when I shop, maybe we'll become friends or maybe lovers. Time will tell. Right now I'm just glad I did what I needed to do for myself; be more social.",,False,,False,t3_18iezf

As nice as it is to get support from SOs or here with the stories and badges.   In the end

Inner strength comes when you become a man for yourself first.   It starts with self control and proceeds to self confidence and self growth and self esteem - all of which improve self control and the cycle repeats.

My own personal nofap journey is about self control first.   I am using my desire and intensity and redirecting it towards meaningful growth: physical

It is very hard at times.  

My personal form of relief is to listen to loud music on my way home from the gym and growling and grunting as the incredibly strong man I am.   I then draw on those moments throughout my day both when I feel weak and when I need strength.   I am more assertive

I wish you guys well.

Edit:

These techniques are a form of cognitive behavioral therapy. Self-talk is a critical part of rewiring your neural pathways and resetting your way of thinking. They do not need to be ""true"" every day and every minute of my life. But they do help me.

1367254837.0,1dciyn,40 days - shit's getting serious! Dem super powers...,ForANewFuture,362,59,125,"The last 10 days have been wild. Let me tell you that if you've hit a lull on your way up the NoFap day count

Days 30 to 40 have been characterized by extreme horniness. My superpowers kicked in around the 20's to 30's (can't remember exactly)

Superpower #1 - Extreme Confidence. It doesn't matter where I'm at, and eye contact with anyone that looks at me. I am not a ripped guy by any means. I was in the past more or less what they call an ectomorph, or someone who can't gain weight. That's been changing, and I actually get compliments on my physique now.

Superpower #2 - There has been an extremely large influx in the number of women who have been sending me dirty pictures. It's both extremely tempting, fuck it, she's playing with you. Dare her to give you what you want. If she doesn't like you, move on."" In fact, last night one of the girls I've been talking to called me ""a man of risk"", which was immediately followed by a picture of her on all fours. It feels good. I've never once been that guy in my entire life. If you're at all worried about your looks, don't. I'm starting to think women care more about how you act

But I'm in control. I've been straight up offered sex, tease them, play with them, and bust on them. As long as you aren't a complete ass, you'll be fine. It also shows you have some spine. After my finals are over, I will be driving to that girl's house and spending a weekend. I like to think of it as my reward for a very long semester. We had a conversation last week about how I don't jerk it or look at porn anymore. I was telling her how badly I want it, and also mentioned how I'm probably going to come extremely fast. Her response? ""We can just go 14 times, and started talking about something else to which she replied ""so

Superpower #3 - Not giving a fuck. No, show dedication, and are a somewhat social person, you WILL find a girl. But the mentality of you doing anything and everything you can to be with her needs to go. Don't put the pussy up on a pedestal....

The biggest change this NoFap go around is my mentality. I tried for a couple of months to get myself past the 7 day streak and failed miserably. I was almost more hurt by the lack of self control I had over myself, and none of it worked. I'll tell you the entire secret to nofap. This is literally the only piece of advice you need to succeed:

You have to want it bad enough to do whatever it takes to achieve your goal. If it isn't powerful enough to change how you act

That's it, no matter the field.

1343920142.0,xkdj4,Porn and hyperreality,Odimasira,349,49,67,"I just thought I'd share some thoughts about why P and M can be so psychologically damaging in the long-term

Of all the possible reasons for me to embark on NoFap, psychologically, my expectations regarding sex were so skewed that I was seriously disappointed in the real thing. Porn presents an artificial, distilled sexual experience, and encourages us to identify with the subjects thereof, and over time this identification commandeers our libido. Over the course of a long-term addiction, porn use creates a sense of depersonalization regarding sexual experience, and creates disappointment when our experience does not compare to that found in porn. This happens unconsciously, tailor-made to feed your sex-related dopamine circuits.

Moreover, or when in a real sexual experience - we are used to simply receiving such rewards with little to no work, and therefore we have built up no tolerance to the risk and anxiety which naturally come with it. P and M are easy and undemanding, and provide us with gratification quickly and efficiently.

This is their true danger - their ability to twist our perceptions of reality and to make us unsuitable for real partners. Only by leaving porn and masturbation behind can we reclaim our libidos for the real world,False,,t5_2skrn,False,,month8,t3_xkdj4

Let me explain to you exactly what will happen:

You will find a decent escort  for a minimum of $250 an hour.

**1)** She'll ask for verification that you aren't law enforcement. Congrats, and your phone number. Goodluck running for office or having a high profile job one day - you're now bait for blackmail.

**2)** You're going to be heading to an ATM and sketchily withdrawing $260 worth of cash and stuffing it in a wallet. Congrats

**3)** You call the girl an hour before the meeting - your socially awkward self is going to be nervous and breaking up your words on the phone with her. She's going to give you the address nonchalantly.

**4)** You arrive at the hotel, she still needs to get ready. As you're waiting sketchily in the parking lot hotel, you can't help but dart your eyes all around you and hope there aren't cops around. You try to avoid eye contact with anyone else in that lot because 'omg what if they notice im being weird and they realize what I'm doing?'

**5)** Time is close, you realize you have no idea where the elevator is and staff already saw you. What if your escort had multiple clients that day? What if they're catching on to something? What if the staff don't recognize you and confront you for being suspicious. You panic and avoid eye contact all you can and you finally find the elevator. Someone else is getting on with you. You hit the button to the desired floor and as you're on your way up, you're nervous as hell that the guy next to you will try and interact with you or even worse - get off on the same floor as you. He gets off on the floor before... Phew, close call.

**6)** You finally reach the floor of your appointment. You walk towards the door. You're nervous as hell. You look around making sure no one else is there. You knock. The door slowly opens, she's still a hot woman and I forgot I'm nervous as hell around them."" You clam up, nerves wound tight, she smiles and hugs you trying to make you feel a little more comfortable. Oh, and by the way, she's nowhere near as hot as her pictures or the fantasies you played in your head of her.

**7)** She asks for your 'donation', and take a quick shower. You're extremely nervous - more nervous with negative energy than excitement. Your fantasies of ravaging a super model were shattered by 2 things immediately when you walked into the door - **1) **you forgot that you're still awkward around women and an escort is still another human being even if the sex is guaranteed, and there's no way you're going to have that fantastic sex you imagined in your head **2)** she isn't anywhere near as hot or as young as you thought she would be. You're just going to go with the motions at this point anyway. You dry yourself off, put on a towel, and head into the room with her.

**8)** She starts to have conversation with you, maybe she'll compliment you a bit too. Now you might start feeling like 'omg this girl actually thinks im attractive!'. And she gets down to the business. 

**9)** Your hour is up. The experience was nothing like you thought it would be - it didn't meet up with any of the porn fantasies you had and you feel no different because of it. You didn't have the confidence to lead because your social inhibitions kept you from asking what you want. When your time is up she all of a sudden becomes very business like and you rush out of the door. 

**10)** You leave the room and head down to the parking lot avoiding all matters of eye contact on the way. You get into your car

If you think you have it rough with women now

**11)** Months go by, and you can't help but see yourself browsing escort sites again. 'Maybe this one will be different!'. You cave in, convincing yourself that you probably just need more variety to make you more sexually confident. Your dick leads you to another escort in another hotel, and the results are the same. 

**12)** Step 11 happens over and over - sleeping with prostitutes and jacking it to pornography is all your brain knows about sexuality. You're now hooked on the habit of seeking sexual gratification with your wallet - whether it be via porn

===============================================================================

EDIT: As ye all want my story 

I have known this girl for half a year. Had a major crush on her when we first met. Been talking to her on and off since we met. Well my parents were away, fun in general also some how i was trying to check her pulse through her chest. Then we sit down to watch inception its around 2 in the morning.  Well that's when we start making out and then we move on to up stairs and then she is all like ""Are you one of those guys who has condoms next to his bed"" and i am like ""yes"" and she says"" i wonder what that says about you"" and i say ""obviously that i don't want to get a girl pregnant"" she responds with ""i meant does this sort of thing happen a lot to you"". Well i tell her i am a virgin. She doesn't believe me (Massive EGO boost that was). I swear to her, even pinky promised it took a while to convince her. eventually she was convinced. This probably had something to do with the fact i was so nervous. I was shaking. She said we don't have to do this. This did not help my nerves. I mean this is a girl i really like and not only do i really like her but also she is up for it. There I am having a little heart attack and well all of a sudden i go from having a all night long rock hard boner to not being able to get it up. I asked could we do it in the morning instead. She looks disappointed but she says ""yeah"". Ten minutes later we are making out and I jizz my pants. I tell her straight out. She says""well now i dont feel so bad so"". Next morning anyway we did it. I think i lasted for only like 3 minutes but yeah whooo.  I finally lost it and to someone i like. :]



Well i can say for certain that if it wasn't for nofap i would have simply not even have texted her but the sexual urge has built in me so much. I essentially wouldn't have even been embarrassed even if she turned me down that night. I had to find out what would happen because i cant lie around waiting anymore to find out if someone likes me. I have to get sexual release. So that gives me courage.
The best thing no-fap has done for me has been a over all improvement in mood levels. I used to get depressed a lot and now well not at all. I get agitated some times but its nothing compared to the depression i used to feel. No fap helped with energy levels and motivation and has made me more productive in general.

I realized something last night that I had previously forgotten, for a pop-science book at least. But I did take something away from it. Something that had helped me quit smoking a couple years ago.

When I quit smoking, because you'd get that buzz going. But what I'd forget is that my stomach would feel like garbage afterwards, I often got headaches, and I fucking felt lethargic all the time. 

Now, I kind of see myself like a lab rat who has electrodes hooked up to the pleasure-response part of his brain that activate every time he pushes a button. At first, you might think the little dude was just in heaven, sitting there spamming the living shit out of that button. But I think most psychologists would tell you that he's fucking miserable - he's sitting there, pressing that button, he has no clue why, but he just *has* to keep pressing it. He forgets to eat, fuck.

Sitting there, my first thought is usually ""I fucking hate myself"" or something about hurting myself. And then I get pissed off because I relapsed, and my dick has this weird numb feeling to it for like three days - in fact, life has a weird numb feeling to it for a few days. 

I didn't intend this post to be this long - my original point was only this: examine your urges and experiences really closely (not too closely though, but that the dopamine in you does, it really empowers you to say no. 

Last thought: how do you feel after you say no to an urge? Disappointed? What about 30 minutes later? I bet you're not so disappointed you didn't fap. At the time, not worse. ",,False,,t5_2skrn,False,,

This will probably be my last update, and Reddit for changing my life. [6 months ago I posted an update](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/ob6xa/approaching_the_6_month_mark/), and since then I feel like I've found true meaning in life. I'd like to say that I'm more creative, intelligent, and hardworking than any other man I've come across - but that would be a lie. No, I can't take the credit for the path my life has come across now. At least not all of it. While I may not be more talented, the advantage I now possess is being incredibly driven. 

When I fapped, a quick fap would make everything feel better. Not much unlike a child's security blanket. I knew I had a problem, I think everyone who does it knows they have a problem. But, I didn't have any of the motivation or willpower required to put a stop to it. Just like with most gambling addicts or alcoholics, sometimes they have to hit rock bottom to realize they need to change. I was lucky in that I didn't have to do that, though if I hadn't changed when I did I could see my life going that direction indefinitely.

* I started an internet-based company. It grew

* I purchased a new property and started a vineyard and orchard. I was originally interested in brewing beer

* I've learned to speak German

* I took up blacksmithing as a hobby. I really enjoy making gardening tools

* I discretely took an extended sailing course and for our anniversary a few months ago I surprised my wife with a brief sailing trip around southern Florida and stops through Key West and Miami. I took the advice of someone on here and forged her a ring out of 14K gold with sapphires embedded in it, our relationship has improved ten-fold.

* I've made a few apps that are currently in both the Apple App Store and the Google Play market. None are selling

* I watched A LOT of movies. Though I still have a lot more to see. At first it was just something to distract me from either fapping or video games. You see, Hulu, and YouTube Movies. I still like Netflix the best because it doesn't have ANY commercials.

I started fapping really early, I found the first bits of porn and dad's stash of dirty magazines, as well as explicit stories. When I got my first internet connection, I browsed for porn, in the old modem days mostly flicks of 15 seconds. Then, everything got faster. When I was 18, my life got worse. In hindsight, being a nerd (programming in obscure languages, but only sexually - emotionally

The next step in bettering myself was a diet, grains and sugar now seem as unhealthy to me as arsenic.

Last year, with ever narrowing, completely random fetishes. My problem with real world sex wasn't ED (only once), but DE, and it still is. My advanced fapping technique simply was too far from normal sexual stimulation that I have desensitized myelf so much that I never came from PIV sex. I even visited a professional in the hope that her experience would overcome my desensitized state, to no avail. It was only awkward.

I found this subreddit and it immediately clicked. My experience with diet was that not doing something is a far more powerful intervention that doing something.

So I tried.

What is my experience with NoFap?

Well, I had multiple flatlines. I moved all the porn on my hard-drive to a friend's hard-drive, ""just in case"" (I don't want it back, ever!). My mood stabilized after about 80 days. I had sex three or four times in that phase, and it neither hurt nor helped.

Since then

First of all, but it extended my vision, my forward-thinking from a couple of minutes/hours/days to months and years. I have taken more and wiser long-term decisions in the last 70 days or so than in the last five years. Too vague? Here's an example: Recently, a friend of a friend had trouble with her boyfriend, and needed some time off and find a place to sleep for one night. I offered that she could sleep at my place. Though she tried multiple times to coerce me into sex, I was easily able to hold back because the thought of possible and likely long-term consequences were more powerful thant the short kick from sleeping with a girl. I don't think I would have been able to say no half a year ago. BTW, she thanked me the next day for not sleeping with her.

Second, making explicit remarks etc. And the best thing is, I don't care, because every time some tramp wants to get into my pants, I think to myself that she's just not worth it, I want a real relationship. Problem is of course that not responding to such overt female advances it drives them crazy, because they are not used to rejection from men and they try even harder then. If you ever thought that in your most stupid fapper days you behaved in the utmost awkward manner and your behaviour could never be topped

Third

Fourth, simply doing ""the right thing"".

Fifth, but that she simply crossed a border I am not able to tolerate. I can tell that this action made me interesting to her.

Sixth

So, but slowly. As the main page reads, it is the ultimate challenge. Go for
it.

What are my plans? Get a little bit better every day

My idea is that people really are rational and will listen to reason, it will eventually become easier not to fap than to fap, because you will be very clear that you're only hurting yourself. 

Right now, and you're using *willpower* to stop. You're thinking: ""I need to stop this. I can do it this time!"" Well, willpower doesn't work. Just like you need very specific tools to fix a specific car issue (and you won't do it by staring at it and willing it to fix itself), you need to think very specific thoughts which will make it clear that you're hurting yourself. Here are thoughts that worked for me, written in a text that I read daily:

---
I no longer wish to masturbate. Masturbating has plenty of consequences which I find unpleasant. 

Without masturbating I’d be rested all day and could deal with more challenging tasks and be more productive. That would make me happier in many areas other than masturbation. 

Masturbating makes me fall asleep harder

If I stopped masturbating

If I don’t masturbate sex gets better because of my full sacks, so I won’t miss any opportunities. 

Without masturbation I am more interested in females even non-sexually, and am more charming. 

Research shows that imagining that you achieved something which you didn’t activates the same reward circuits as if you did, and my positive tension will grow until I find a girl to have sex with.

Research also shows that testosterone is higher in people who don’t masturbate.

My memories are all that I have of my past. I remember none of my masturbation sessions

To stop myself from masturbating

It helps not to got to porn sites

I masturbate mostly in situations when I should be doing something else

I don’t really masturbate to release my urge for sex. The urge comes when I’m masturbating. I start masturbating so that I wouldn’t have to do other stuff, then why don’t I get a wish to masturbate for weeks when I’m on vacation with my friends?

When it feels like I won’t make it

The longer I don’t masturbate

I know that I don’t even want to masturbate. The unwanted consequences far outweigh the wanted ones. There is no desire

---


I removed some benefits/reasons that probably pertain only to me.

These are just an example and it's likely that some of these won't work for you, otherwise you will soon forget them and start fapping again.


tl;dr: Repeating the reasons why you don't want to fap daily is far more effective than using willpower and believing that you will somehow just do it this time.

The mind naturally tries to justify the urges for porn, because it's convinced we need it. When I started hearing its reasons for all of these, that's when I most frequently found myself relapsing. 


**We need to be aware of this one truth: becoming clean means not satisfying the urges.** Let that really sink in. Anything else your mind tells you is merely an attempt to make you relapse.  


There is no gray area or ""moderation."" Only addicts have ever had a need to reach the justifications I'll be listing


It's difficult to stay clean when we believe this ""reasoning"" our mind tries to give us. And living in a society that encourages irresponsible sex doesn't make it easier. We have to fight its ""logic"" with truth, that's a will.


An ignorant addict is a committed addict. If you don't know the facts behind porn and the tricks your mind uses


Keep in mind: I've experienced all of these justifications, you'll find they disappear and you're left with just the urge which is much easier to control afterward.


**DISTRESS** 


Recovery is an emotionally exhausting phase in our lives. It won't be long before we experience a moment that is very stressful. At these times


1) I'll always be lonely 


2) Now that I'm addicted


3) This will take my mind off things 


4) It's the only way I can feel good 


5) Only this will make the pain go away 


6) I need it to think clearly


7) This will make the urge stop 


8) I'm afraid of life without it 


9) I already started


10) I'm not strong enough to quit 


11) I'm too ashamed now 


12) I can never forgive myself 


13) The world will never accept me because of what I've done


14) I'm so angry; this will calm me down 


**""RATIONALIZE IT AWAY** 


15) It's perfectly natural 


16) Others do it so it must be okay 


17) I'm the problem


18) I can control it without getting carried away 


19) I'll do it less and less until I quit 


20) This is what I want


21) Resisting it is unhealthy 


22) If I don't watch the hardcore stuff


23) It's fine if I watch amateur stuff instead of pornstars 


24) It's okay if the people aren't real 


25) I don't have to watch porn
versa) 


26) I can masturbate if I don't fantasize 


27) No one's getting hurt if it's just me involved 


28) As long as no one else is suffering but me


29) If no one knows about it


30) I can quit when I'm older and stronger 


31) Some people can't be cured or don't have the willpower 


32) I'll wait until I have a boyfriend/girlfriend to quit 


33) If I do all this stuff with my boyfriend/girlfriend instead
okay 


34) No one else cares so why should I?


35) This is what I am and I should accept it


36) There's nothing wrong with masturbation


37) I don't need boundaries in sex


38) Some people have problems but it's not with sex or porn 


39) There is no responsibility in sexuality. As long as it's consensual
doesn't matter what I do or how I think 


40) If people act like sluts


41) Porn and masturbation and sex are tools meant to be used


42) If a person wants to be used for sex or porn


43) The urge will always be there


44) If I want to dirty myself


45) It's natural to ogle someone and want to have sex with them


Like I said, you're denying it something you ""need,"" so of course it's going to try and convince you to relapse. Follow even one of these lies, I guarantee you will never get clean.


It's not enough to go a few days or even a year without this stuff. If nothing about us changes


Our viewpoints on sexuality have been heavily shaped by fiction and misinformation. From porn, I mean novels, movies, games, you name it). We took lessons on reality from fantasy and look where it got us. 


Getting clean requires these three things: recognizing the truth about sex addiction and porn


Some might ask what I mean about the third one. It means you can walk through life without having a desperate need to have sex or masturbate. It means not needing to be in a relationship. Of course you can want to be in one, and are to never be used for our sexual gratification under any circumstances. 


And in case this was misconstrued


So that's it. No bs. Take what I've shown you and use it to help you in your recovery.

Last night

This is pretty out of character for me. I never did anything by myself. I just wanted to go and I did.

It was fucking crazy. It was so easy to walk up to women and compliment them and strike up a conversation. I wasn't intimidated at all and hit on every hottie I saw. I was able to strike up conversations with random strangers and made some new friends. Got a couple of numbers and I noticed gorgeous women bee lining straight for me and smiling at me from a distance.

I'm getting less and less intimidated by anyone I see. ""These motherfuckers can't nofap""



I still have to work on my game. but 30 days ago....maybe even 2 weeks I would never catch this level or amount of feminie attention. Not a fucking chance.

1364933903.0,1bjdu7,90 Days. A whole new life!,Nofappin2013,351,58,184,"I'll keep this (semi) brief

I stopped on December 31, no edging, etc. I'll put my thoughts into a list, in no particular order - Just my thoughts.

- nofap made me realize that I can overpower my brain and body. I had a horrible PMO addiction. Breaking that addiction was basically me giving a giant middle finger to my inner urges

- Overpowering your temptations for a long time will make you realize things. ""If I can overpower this... I can do anything."" THAT'S how nofappers become gods (superpowers). They stop giving into their immediate desires

- Stopping fapping opens up a lot of free time and a LOT of free energy that you didn't have before. If you choose to replace fapping with something healthy

- I started a *very* strict diet and exercise routine for the last 90 days. Ask me if you'd like the progress pictures.

- My energy levels have been in-fucking-sane. I can't wait to work out every day

- I read this earlier today, then you will. If you don't want it bad enough, then there's nothing we can do to help you! YOU have to want it for YOURSELF. Convince yourself that you are strong and you don't need to fap, and the sky is the limit for how great you can be.

**Advice**

If you're looking for advice

- You have to convince yourself that you're worth it. This is a mental struggle, then you won't do it. Don't go into this thinking ""Meh, I'll probably relapse after a week or so."" Fuck that. Don't give yourself the mental option to relapse, and you won't.

- You **must** find a replacement for fapping. If you fap as much as I used to (a lot), working out, taking walks, doing pushups, playing with your pets, WHATEVER!! Just pick an activity that you can do WHENEVER you have a temptation, and do that activity every time. In the first week or two, drop to the floor

- Get real life support. /r/nofap is amazing support

- Stop making excuses. I didn't realize how many excuses I used to make for myself. ""There's always tomorrow"" ""I'll be fine"" ""It won't matter"" ""Fapping/skipping workouts/eating horrible foods is OK."" ""I have my whole life to turn this around. I'm only 26.""

1367729481.0,1dpuy9,I've been on NoFap for 6 months as of today. Here are the reasons why I'm continuing.,forwardly,322,36,76,"As of today, and I continue to lengthen my list of reasons to. Below is that list.  

**Clarity of mind**

As most of us know, I become disorganized, miss appointments, forget assignments and quiz dates, have a difficult time studying… the list goes on.

**Freedom from guilt and shame**

These two states of mind have followed me every day for the greater part of my life.  There has never been a time when I have felt proud of vicariously fucking someone, the recollection of binging for hours on end the night before.  I want to be able to look back on this time and smile.  I can’t do that just yet, but that day is much closer than it used to be.

**Confidence**

This almost goes without saying.  One week into a streak and I am, to make eye contact, to raise a point or ask a question in class, to introduce myself to a girl, etc.  As someone who has spent most of their life feeling shy, even inadequate, the confidence that I gain through NoFap is invaluable.  

**Motivation**

Similar to confidence, and I feel better about doing them.  It’s wonderful.

**Self-worth**

This is closely related to being free of guilt and shame.  As much as I try (and you should too) to not let my degree of success with NoFap have a strong bearing on my sense of self-worth, and they always will.  If I am to continue building my self-worth, I need to continue to avoid this.

**Wholeness**

Take this one however you will.  I originally had this listed as “spiritual wholeness”, so I took it out.  Leave it in if it applies ;). It’s a bit of an abstract thing to talk about, but generally I feel more whole as a person when I haven’t PMOed in a while, and if I had a soul, it would be cleaner.  I think other people can see this as well, which can open the invitation for healthy people into your life.

**Affirmation that I can stick to something**

I have a long history of not finishing things, I generally stop exercising as soon as I start, etc.  I need to stick this one out more than I do most things.  Getting to 90 days (and beyond), will be a huge success for me, not just in conquering addiction, but also in staying committed to something.

**Comfort with discomfort**

This is something u/Self_as_object (Mark Queppet / Sacred Sexuality guy) has talked about

**Exercising delayed gratification**

This stems from the previous point, I think exercising the ability to put off something that you desperately want so that you can achieve something more rewarding is beneficial in its own right.

**Being an incredible (eventual) boyfriend**

For me, I have grown more than I have in any other period of my life.  I believe I have something legitimately wonderful to offer the next person that I bring into my world.  I want that person to be fortunate that they are with me, and I think this is now possible. 

**Cessation of objectification**

Invariably, I’ve found that I stop looking for the same visual cues on girls that would lead me to click on them if they were in a thumbnail.  Instead, I began to take in the whole person (&lt;key word), and feel desire for them to be in my life, rather than on my hard drive.

**Emotional wealth**

By whatever mechanism you subscribe to, reading a story, thinking about people in my life, even beautiful ideas can make me emotional.  This wasn’t the case before NoFap.  For as long as I can remember, I have been melancholy and generally unaffected by the world around me.  Certain things were powerful enough to cut through the haze I lived in, but mostly I floated.  I was uncomfortably numb.  The reversal of this has been one of the more profound changes I’ve seen since starting NoFap, and has been particularly rewarding.  

**Creativity**

Emotional sensitivity has given rise to increasingly frequent bursts of creativity.  Being moved by something you’ve created is truly rewarding, I now find myself inspired to think and to create again. 

**Increased arousal when needed**

This hasn’t been as much of an issue for me as it has been (and still is) for a lot of people.  Still

**No more lost sleep to porn binges**

This is a big one for me, and as a consequence, I was unable to really catch up with anyone, and probably left a less than positive impression. Getting enough sleep is one of the most important things you can do for yourself. Coupling sleep debt with reeling from a binge is horrifically uncomfortable and something that I don’t ever want to repeat.

**Self-love**

NoFap is ultimately an act of self-love.  This, then we can learn to forgive ourselves when we fail, we can justify the pain and discomfort, and we can begin to heal our scars.  It both inspires and is born out of our perseverance.  If you take away one thing from me today, I hope it’s this.

After a few minutes of uncomfortable small talk she tells me she is proud of me for owing up to my problem and trying to change. She did reinforce what I suspect was our biggest issue that PMO drove us apart. She felt she could never live up to the girls in the videos. I had killed her self confidence

We both cried a lot

We ended the call with her encouraging me to fix myself for me and no one else. She was proud that I finally realized I had an issue and offered to be a shoulder if I needed one. I never in a million years expected to hear from her. I am honestly still shaken by it. Right now I am a mess

1336529650.0,te057,A new approach to NoFap,vwater1001,325,35,59,"There have been a number of posts on here recently from fapstronauts who found that they have an internet addiction as much as they have a pornography addiction.  I can certainly relate.

But I had an epiphany in the gym today.  Excessive fapping is just a symptom of a much larger problem I have: wasting my life.  I fuck around way too much.  If I'm not fapping, or refreshing my email, or browsing facebook, or half-watching a youtube video while scrolling through an article on CNN.  Not to mention all the fatty foods I'm stuffing my face with at the same time.

This is wasting my life.  

At the end of a day wasted on the internet, anxious, and restless.  I fap to get that drowsy feeling that puts me to sleep.  

However, get some meaningful work done, eat clean, go out with friends, etc. etc., I feel uplifted.  I feel vibrant.  Like I'm sucking the marrow out of the bone of life.  Fapping is literally the last thing on my mind.

So I'd like to suggest a new approach to r/NoFap.  Instead of obsessing over nofapping streaks, go to a class, join a club, meet people, talk to people, fuck people, read a good book, take a road trip with some friends.  I guarantee you won't even be thinking about fapping.  Replacing [pornhub](/nsfw) with quickmeme is not a solution.

1360328052.0,184n6r,I have the worst masturbation addiction you've ever heard of,UnutterableBastard,343,61,196,"This will probably be really long

When I was a young boy, and while I wasn't aware of what was happening at the time, I knew that it felt incredible, and I began to do it regularly.

I now believe that this was what kicked my addiction into gear. A few years later I read about masturbation in a book, and I discovered pornography quite quickly. I printed a couple of images (one of Akira Fubuki that I still look at occasionally for kicks) and hid them in my bedroom, where I would masturbate for hours.

At the age of about 14 or 15 I developed a fetish for small penis humiliation. I believe this was sparked by my realisation that I had a slightly small penis compared to other boys my age. I would find girls to chat with on AIM or other online chat rooms and tell them that I had a small penis in the hope that they would humiliate me. I became utterly obsessed with this and did it every day

By the age of 18 I was masturbating several times a day. Since then, only ejaculating after several hours. Occasionally I will masturbate all through the night without going to sleep. My record for a single session (i.e. one orgasm) is approximately 14 hours straight. I believe this is longer than the verified world record. On a recent business trip to a beautiful island I was given a nice apartment to live in on my own for about 5 days. I only had to work for about 3 hours a day, and I had the rest of the time free to explore the island by myself. But no; instead I chose to spend all my time in my bedroom, masturbating for days on end.

When I was younger I was content masturbating to still images of beautiful girls naked. Over time, like videos where girls were caned mercilessly until they bled. This has legitimately frightened me.

A couple of nights ago I fucked up big time. I recently discovered Tor and the deep web (thanks reddit...) but had never used it to look at anything really bad. On Wednesday, legal) clearnet websites hosting jailbait-style images of non-nude teenage girls (perhaps 16-18 years old). It occurred to me that there would surely be websites on the Tor network that would contain similar images but with nude girls. I navigated to the Hidden Wiki and clicked the ""Jailbait"" section. Long story short, I ended up on a website that had child porn on it. A thumbnail gallery loaded, and while I didn't click on any of the images, I know what I saw. There were pictures of pre-pubescent girls (probably 8-11) engaging in sexual acts, both with other girls their age and with adults. I was horrified and got the fuck out of there immediately, cursing my stupid curiosity for getting me into such a ridiculous situation.

Since then, I'm terrified that the police will turn up at my door and my life will be ruined. I honestly don't know what to do. So here I am. I need to sort my fucking life out.

I'm actually a totally normal guy, and I can't do it on my own.

My most recent girlfriend and I split up a few weeks ago. I dated her for a couple of years and we lived together

I don't believe that there's anything wrong with masturbating

I'm sorry that this doesn't make any fucking sense. I know I'm rambling, say something that might help me.

Nofap, starting with the mind and continuing throughout the body. It rewires everything from how you become aroused to how you treat temptation and self-control. 

Like a muscle waiting to be worked, how your body reacts to sexual stimulus, and more. With nofap, you begin to realize how much of your life is not under your own control, but controlled by how you feel. We tend to seek comfort over discomfort, even at the expense of growth and new experience. 

When I first started Nofap, I encountered many failed attempts. Once I became single, I PMO'd for my last time, I had finally had enough.

I have experienced many ups and downs. Flatlines and Wetdreams being some of the most mystifying. I had wetdreams weekly, and have yet to experience ED since.

I was able to fuck for 6 hours with short breaks every 60 minutes or so. Luckily I had been practicing kegels for 10+ minutes a day

1. My sexual focus had been reoriented from mental to physical/emotional- meaning, I was focused on HER pleasure, and almost forgetful about my own. Granted, I felt great, but watching her enjoy herself was so much more enjoyable than anything I was feeling. I believe this to be the masculine/feminine rolls at their finest. It was simply captivating.

2. I had developed the capability of literally stopping orgasms. After about an hour or so of sex, It would literally bring and orgasm to a halt, or maybe just release a couple drops. AWESOME! 

It's fascinating. What I had interpreted as 'flatlines' was actually a redirection of energy. As if my body was giving up on sending energy to sexual craving and redirecting it toward other things I felt were more relevant in the moment. I was able to focus on my studies

When It came time for sex, friends, mothers and lovers. I am able to speak with a woman and became aroused by her emotional expression rather than solely on her physique. Rest assured, I still get a jolt from how gorgeous they look, but there is no longer a perception that they are outside of reality, as they were in my world of internet porn. Porn made them a purely physical object that was outside of my personal entitlement, as are ferrari's, yachts

Since my experience with nofap, you'll live a life of mediocrity, likely to be full of rich-tasting foods, sexual stimulation (from yourself), and mental masturbation (from your tv). What does that mean? you work, you get fat on the couch, and sex is something you hope happens

Since I've started nofap, not the ones dictated to you by society. With this understanding, I've developed a lifestyle that revolves around health, fitness, sports, knowledge, art, sweat

Nofap is a part of an awesome lifestyle. It provides a much richer experience than jerking it to midget porn ever could. You can kiss your sexual dysfunctions goodbye, and sexual habits all play their role. Find the depth in sex, and you'll find the depth in women. With an attitude of indifference and abundance real women will be able to flow through you life with plenty of pleasure to be had along the way (for both parties).

The nofap journey is an unpredictable one. It has it's rough patches, flatlines, and wetdreams, are all part of the process. TRUST in yourself. Trust in your nature, and understand when you remove the man-made poisons that are disrupting your natural experience of sex, your entire sexual experience will be revolutionized and reverted back to it's purest of essence.

Goodluck nofappers

TLDR: been around the block with nofap. It's good shit. Ask me anything!

1360553881.0,18acvo,Your sexuality is your most powerful tool for self development (powerful analogy inside).,Self_as_object,316,37,89,"Here is a breakthrough I just had that I knew I needed to share with all of you:

As a man, and addiction are like slimy tentacles that hold me back from walking in the sunlight as the person I want to be. Everyone has tentacles like this grasping at them, trying to steal their freedom. 

When we are ensnared

Our willpower is the blade that we use to cut these tentacles from us. The sharper our blade, we have to hack away furiously to just get free from the smallest tentacle. So even if you can momentarily gain freedom, you are so exhausted from the struggle that you can barely get anything done before you get ensnared again. 

This is what has been happening to me lately. I've come this far (27 days) but I've been barely able to do anything productive other than avoiding PMO. I felt like it has robbed all my strength. What I've realized is that I've been working with a dull blade. 

This led to my epiphany that as a man, you can use it to either dull your blade (PMO/lustful indulgence) or sharpen it (higher/pure expression). My blade's edge was basically round when I started this quest and repeatedly failed again and again, hacking away with little more than a broom handle against the tentacles of PMO. Each success exhausted me to the point where I couldn't fight the tentacles anymore and a future failure was inevitable. 

But each time I succeeded in overcoming that urge, to the moderately sharp pumpkin carving knife that has gotten me to 27 days. Now, when I get through an urge, I have enough energy left in the tank to tide me over as my stamina recovers to the point of being able to handle the next serious pang of urge-i-ness. 

And guess what? Now that I know I've hit this equilibrium point

*I welcome the urges now cuz I know these demons are just bitches I'm grinding to level up.*


**TLDR**

* PMO/Addiction/Fear/Guilt are tentacles that wrap us up and hold us back
* When we are completely wrapped up
* Our willpower is a blade that we can use to cut through these tentacles
* If our blade is dull
* Our sexuality is a whetstone that we can use to either sharpen our blade (through pure action) or dull our blade (through giving in)
* As we continuously sharpen our blade

My story is no different than many other guy's. I started a little earlier than most maybe since my dad used to leave porn on Cable when I was around 4-5 and I'd stumble into it. 

Slowly over the years I started needing it more and more

I hit a dry spell recently and haven't had sex regularly for probably over a year. Partly due to being extremely busy at work, but I would be drunk so my inability to stand at full mast was excusable in my mind but I could always finish. 

Lately I've been seeing this new girl. She's fun to be around

Then that day comes. We're at my place, except the engine doesn't want to turn over. You think it's about to rev up any second but it flatlines repeatedly. I then realize what's happening, and of course that makes it worse. It's like a spiral. ""why is this happening?"", ""I haven't had anything to drink, this doesn't make sense"". ""What the fuck is wrong with me!?""

I guess she wasn't like the depraved videos I'd been watching to fall asleep most nights. They'd gotten increasingly weirder and the actual act had become impulsive. ""let's just get in and out of here as hard and fast as possible"" I'd tell myself. No joy at all.

Certainly she must have felt inadequate to some degree. That was nothing however to my deep personal shame over my impotence. I'd heard of NoFap before and had even read some but thought ""man those guys must have other issues

Not all the reasons are scientifically proven



**10 Reasons Why I Refuse To Watch Pornography**

1. The kind of porn that most turns you on

2. It gives you a fake impression of sex

3. Porn is far more than a simple activity you just do. It affects your subconscious and all other parts of your life. The images of porn will be burned into your brain (because of the hormones and dopamine released) for years and even a lifetime. 

4. Porn forces you to objectify the opposite sex and think about sex more and more until it begins to take over your life. This

5. Pornography and masturbation are self-serving activities. Consequently they create a self-oriented sex drive

6. By viewing pornography you are supporting the porn industry and helping it grow. You are also contributing to the sexual exploitation of the porn stars you watch. 

7. Looking at porn will put shame and embarrassment into your life

8. Porn decreases your ability to get turned on by real women

9. Porn makes you a slave to your own cravings. This can lead to other destructive behaviours and negative emotions such as anger

10. You cannot lead a healthy life as a porn addict

**2. It also seems second or third-rate.** Fapping to something is like trying to sate your hunger by looking at a picture of a steak dinner. It's a poor replacement for the real thing.

**3. Sexual desire is a form of energy.** When you turn off the faucet, meet new people, pick up a hobby, etc.

**4. It shows you how dehumanizing objectification is.** Every single one of those people you fapped to has, it's very difficult to just see them as a sex object again.

**5. Stopping my PMO addiction has made me desire real love.** I was a sex addict. Most of the time, with every piece of my heart. Now sex seems like such a small, silly thing, compared to love.

Sorry if this is scattered

I want to get into a relationship.
I want to lose 50 lbs.
I want to be successful entrepreneur.

**For the 1st goal**

**A Wisher is**: someone who sits home all day (while asking 'why am I never in a relationship?) and only dreams about being with a cute girl. Blames the world/god/nature for 'bad genetics'

**A Doer is**: someone who doesn't separate people into leagues. See's a cute girl and knows she's attractive, she's hot""). When he goes out to say, a nightclub, and *this is important*, does NOT make it a goal to ""get with a girl"", his goal at this point is to have fun. The saying in the 1902 book As a man thinketh described this well: ""Men do not attract that which they want, but that which they are."". Doers don't fantasize about being with cute girls

**For the 2nd goal**

**A Wisher is**: someone who plans to exercise (tomorrow, etc), tells all their friends, takes all the before pictures, and fantasizes about fitting into those jeans. When an obstacle hits (from cravings to plateaus) they seek external motivation. Temptations overpower them, not always, but usually. Their ""metabolism sucks"" and ""they've tried every diet to no avail""

**A Doer is**: someone who plans to exercise (today), nor do they buy those jeans they plan on fitting into it. Goals are set in days, weeks at max with a simple ""Am I losing weight?"" or ""Am I not losing weight?"" - like a self-guiding missile, if they are losing weight they don't change anything, if they aren't, they find out what's going wrong. Plateaus, craving, but they are constantly reminding themselves of how bad they feel when they indulge. When they do give in here and there

**For the 3rd goal**

**A Wisher is**: someone who says 'some day', fear losing money, and fear rejections. Perfection is what they aim for, always, even if it means stalling the best test of all: the market itself.

**A Doer is**: someone who wants to be successful (financially) but isn't motivated by money, the execution is 99%**). Instead of dreaming of being rich or riding in their Lamborghini, they see business as a game; the funniest, greatest, most amazing game to have ever existed. Perfection is impossible thus no aimed for. Competition is a great as it means there exists a market and the hard work (that is, testing to see if a market even exists) has been done.

&gt;I believe the 2nd goal can successfully apply to NoFap. 

**tl;dr** In other words, and making everything they go for in life a certainty, not a fantasy. That every roadblock is part of the bump in the road, and that self-confidence is the greatest and most effective tool at accomplishing ANYTHING, bar none. Successful people, whenever they catch themselves dreaming, STOP and think how they are going to get FROM where they are TO where they want to be

Fapping is a lot like gravity. You don't know anyone who is really not under the power of it. It controls us. We can't get out of the cycle of gravity because it is always pulling us down. 

Why leave planet fearth when everyone else is here? They doesn't seem to be anything wrong. But there is. We can't stop it. The idea that because everyone is under the influence of it does not make it right.

So let's leave earth. Let's escape gravities pull. And become what only a tiny fraction of the human population has become. Fapstronauts.

Escaping gravity is difficult, we can be on the moon. Making that one giant leap for mankind, doing what no other people have done before.

1364070962.0,1avkun,"Starting to see what being ""Healed"" might feel like",oc192,284,23,54,"With my wife and kids away for the day I decided to do some long overdue cleanup in the garage.  Stumbled randomly unto an old PC hard drive hidden away at the bottom of a personal box that probably has not seen the light of day for ten years.  

Magically the disk still worked.  Unfortunately it contained tons of XXX hard core porn and twisted perversion intermixed along with sentimentally valuable long lost family vacation

I knew right away that my wife would be delighted to have those family photos recovered and saved off to a DVD for safe keeping.  But that would mean wading carefully through a minefield of hidden porn folders from my decades of personal fetish porn collection dating back to the days of dial up BBS.  

I stumbled a couple of times today but I did not fall.  It was strange to experience how quickly a couple of wrong double clicks onto some of my favorite fetish .jpg's could instantly set my heart racing and my dopamine receptors into overdrive.  Even six months ago the briefest exposure to that type of material would have triggered another relapse and a drawn out PMO fest.  

Today I employed my self control to stop myself from looking further or relapsing and focused instead on saving  the good photos and trying to avoid stumbling onto anymore of the bad.   

The ""Healed"" feeling came after the family photos DVD was created and tested.  Without any further hesitation I used a ten pound sledge hammer to destroy that old hard disk into a thousand pieces right there on my garage floor. 

So TIL that I still cannot control the instant dopamine rush that those type of photos will give me and perhaps I never will be able to.  

But nowadays my life is so much better in so many ways and with so much more to look forward to that I know better then to ever allow myself to give into the temptation or to even want that stuff lying around.

Looking back on it all, and he tried to help me stop the only way he knew how, by putting content blockers on our computers at home.  I love my father, and he has been a huge help in my life, but how naive he was to think a porn blocker could keep me out!  I won't go into details about how I did it, but circumventing the software was pathetically simple.  

After that my dad never found out about the porn again, self-loathing, and hateful individual.  What the next two paragraphs have to say is horrible, and I will carry the weight of these memories to my grave.  

I hated who I was.  I hated that I could not gather enough courage and strength to stop my PMO addiction.  I tried to stop more times than I can remember

I was a wreck in every way.  And I helped kill one of the only friends I ever had.  This friend came to me asking for help, but I told him that life is shit and nothing matters.  He ran his car off the freeway later that night, a clean cut vehicular suicide.  The next day when I talked to his girlfriend she told me what had happened, and I laughed.  I laughed when I learned that one of my only friends in the world killed himself.  

It is impossible for me to put into words how disgusted I am with who I was.  The old me was a monster.  I am honestly surprised I never raped or sexually assaulted anyone.  The only thing holding me back was shame.  The one thing I held onto was my desire to please my dad.  I did not want him to know who I was on the inside.  I went to church every Sunday and Wednesday

This hell lasted for a few years until one day I decided to kill myself.  I knew I was sick in the head, shame, and total self hatred.  But I could not go through with it.  I could not even bring myself to end myself!  Do you have any idea what that's like?  Being so totally controlled by your own body that you can't not even destroy yourself?  And so at age 17 I allowed myself to be a slave to my body.  I created a schedule: 
Wake up, do homework, eat dinner, play video games, watch porn until I got too tired to continue, go to sleep, repeat.  I became a robot.  Following the same schedule... day after day.

Well,  to all the liars out there, you know that a question is very dangerous.  If you don't have the right tools in place and a proper cover story, a simple question can ruin everything.  Well, when A (my new friend) started to ask me questions... I felt too tired to come up with a good cover story.  So I told him the truth.  The next day, he introduced me to a friend of his, K.  Well, but I also knew who I was.  So I went to war.  I deleted all the porn off my computers

After 90 days of absolutely zero porn of any kind (not even playing video games like skyrim), and nothing even remotely sexual in any way, I am a new person.  I have changed from the deepest part of my being.  Nothing is the same.  I used to lie to anyone and everyone about anything, now I can't get myself to say anything dishonest, even if I wanted to... I just cant.  Also, I have self confidence.  Prior to October of last year I had only one friend, and we rarely hung out.  Now, and I am making new friends everywhere I go.  This sounds silly, no personality, I have drive.  I will gain 25 pounds of muscle this year

So, you can do it.  Seriously, if the fucked up piece of shit that I used to be can change, you can do it too.  Now, the first thing you need to do if you want to start this journey is to get yourself a friend that you know you can trust, and lay your situation out to them.

Yet, 

‘Stop Or You’ll Go Blind’ has taken on a whole new devastating meaning. 

Looking at a computer screen and jerking off to the digital ghosts of women makes you 

**Blind** to so many deeply important elements of life. 

For instance:

* Your ability to control your self

* Your ability to begin experiencing peace

* Your ability to explore the profound value of discipline.  

* Blind to the score of women all around you all the time that hold your gaze and then sneak a look at your package while passing. 

* Blind to the delicate contours of nearly every womans emotional (her present self) and physical health (her tremendous body). 

Right now

Just seeing a woman remove her bra in front of you feels like a lightning bolt of pleasure coursing through your rib cage. I could never use condoms because they spelled instant ED for me every time. Now

When someone uses your computer

The same goes for your consciousness, you were just blind to that because two hours ago you jerked off to a 2D Sascha Grey clip on your faptop.

There wasn’t a single time

What was I ashamed about? 

I was diminishing the value of women and therefore myself. 

I was letting the women in my city down and therefore myself. 

I was going blind.

It’s so easy now to see the vacant look in mens eyes everywhere

I feel rejuvenated and powerful and I’d be interested in a study that examines the spike in depression as directly linked to broadband access to porn. 

Stick with it and you'll find out how easy it is not to. 

It now reminds me of playing with G.I. Joes for hours

Don't let the women in your life down! 

Give them your whole self and discover a new level of ecstasy together!

1351125275.0,121e2b,One Year Report,ArdentDrive,300,40,72,"It’s been a year since I masturbated.

Reflecting on the past year has put much into perspective. Thanks to occasional journal entries and posts to this forum, this type of perspective gives me intuition into what type of goals I should set for the future and how to conduct myself to achieve them.

I’m writing here today to share with you what I've gotten out of it so far

**One Year Ago**

To give you an idea of my progress

I cut out masturbation a year ago at age 22. I was a college dropout living at my parents’ house, and I felt a general sense of boredom and lacking. I’d get off to Internet porn 4 to 7 times a week, and have sex about half as often. In bed, I’d sometimes go limp during and have to stop. I didn't really think it was an issue because it didn't happen all the time.

I joined NoFap not because I thought my porn habits were a problem, and as if I were becoming complacent with my mediocre situation. I knew NoFap wouldn't be a magic bullet when I started, but it felt like a “first step.” I just needed some direction to move in, to see where I could go from there. Anything was better than wasting my early twenties in my parents’ house with an unstable job and an unstable girl.

**What I've Done**

Briefly and chronologically:

* I left the consulting gigs and got a real internship.
* I moved out of my parents’ to the city.
* I dumped the needy girl and started playing the field.
* I re-applied to college and was accepted.
* I met a smart hottie and started dating her.
* My internship offered me a full-time job.
* I turned down the job offer to go back to college

I don't attribute these events to abstaining from masturbation. NoFap helped catalyze them though -- especially the women-related ones. Here’s a deeper look.


**General Physiological Changes**

The best way I can describe what I've given myself by not fapping is a mild discomfort in my stomach and chest (like “butterflies”). It grows when I’m not accomplishing things, being social, or leading. Sorry if this sounds a little eastern.

I’d previously get this feeling only rarely

Not jacking it made that feeling so strong I couldn't possibly suppress it all with my mind. So I followed advice I read on this subreddit: I (clumsily) ran, writing, and throwing myself out there at parties more.

Somewhere along the line I realized all that is the point. Suppressing that light stomach-chest feeling feels like fear. Channeling that feeling into whatever I choose is exciting

**Vocal Changes**

There are a lot of excitable guys in this subreddit claiming miracles. But the change in voice is real.

Not only is my voice a little deeper

I've been putting my voice to use recently. I was asked to announce a large annual regatta

**Creativity and Spontaneity**

I picked my music back up

I second-guess myself less. I've found my first thought is usually right. And when it's wrong, or waiting for the moment to say it. This might be contrary to the popular advice “think before you speak”, but when I do it, I often find people agreeing with me. Maybe that advice is just for those prone to poor wording.

**Sex**

In my [Six Month Report](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/t3pbi/6_month_report)

I have sex only with my girlfriend, which I hope to assuage. I probably never would have even asked if I were still watching porn.

And just to cover all the bases, ability, and virility in bed have increased tenfold since starting this journey.

**Women**

My buddy and I were drinking some beers and cooking some t-bones. At a silence

“Why's that?” he asked.

“Because you're single. You can have sex with any girl you can charm and seduce. We're at college

“Yeah

After a moment's contemplation

That conversation has probably played out millions of times, my buddy wasn't lying about her looks. I got her with energy and drive that NoFap helped provide me.

Maybe it’s a grass-is-always-greener situation. But I miss the titillation of meeting new girls and seducing them that I was having closer to the beginning of NoFap. So much that I flirt with other girls as much as I can without hurting my girlfriend or making her jealous. It’s still not the same though. Believe it or not

I feel like I'll have to make a decision before too long: I'll either end things with this amazing girl because I’m young and desperately want to feel the intensity of being a completely free man; Or I'll make a bigger commitment to her

NoFap has helped keep my relationship vibrant

**Men**

I've noticed for the first time other guys looking up to me and watching what I do for guidance. It’s led me to a leadership role on my sports team at college. It’s extra pressure, which I have more of now.

**The Future**

NoFap is here to stay. Porn and masturbation are out. I like who I am now a lot better than who I was a year ago. I want to continue to improve myself in all aspect of my life.

I didn't meet all the goals I laid out for myself after starting NoFap.

I didn't “become a force” in my company during my internship

I didn't “make the most of city living, and made some friends.

I didn't build the huge entourage I had envisioned

I didn't achieve a zen-like clear mind

In another year

I may not have become the impregnable force I had hoped for

Here’s to always doing.

1358025640.0,16gdzz,89 Days. Tomorrow is 90. My thoughts. My experience. My wisdom. ,Superfluity10k,320,63,105,"I found NoFap while surfing reddit about a month into my redditing career. I've been a redditor for 11months and its taken almost a full year long to hit 90 days. I was a regular 2-a-day-PMO career porn surfer for over a decade. Death Grip. No sex drive to real women. Sex was scary - I can't hold an erection. 

I relapsed countless times on my way to 90 - you may also - just stick with it. 

Its worth it. 

Since my last relapse (22 day streak) I decided I was ready for 90 and nothing was going to stop me. I quit PMO but not looking at women entirely - I still subscribe to GW and felt I needed to see some tits and ass to keep me sane - even if it meant not acting upon it. 

*You don't need to go cold turkey from looking at women - you just need to go cold turkey from acting upon your urges.* 

Since I set off on this journey I have found a new fulfilling job (maybe career) in sales and am a much more positive and outgoing person. I am connected to myself and understand the needs of others.

Around day 70 I started to tell people about my NoFap instead of hiding it away - specifically 2 women. They were in awe over it and didn't believe me but they realized I was not joking. I remember my long time friend said* ""... I dont know whats changed but you are so much fun to hang out with lately.""* - Thats when I told her. She was floored and didn't understand it but eventually realized it was working just by the way I was acting

She has told her friends about me and they all say ""Really? No way..."" She insists its true and they then tell her its incredibly hot - which makes me feel even better. 

I feel confident in every part of my life. I hooked up with my ex girlfriend (she knows about nofap and is now 50 days no schlick) and she doesn't refer to it as ""morning wood"" - yesterday she asked me how my ""morning steel"" was. I could beat her dead with my cock. 

Literally. 

For those of you struggling just keep with it. A relapse is not something to be down about - My journey has been filled with failure but I made it. I'm 20hours away from the top of the mountain. 

To put things in perspective-

I can fap now. And be done in 30 seconds.....

Or I can resist

60seconds*60minutes*24hours= 86
Which = 2
Which =7

Why throw away 30 seconds of death grip porn for 8million seconds?

If someone told you you can have $30 dollars now

Thats how I feel. I'm fucking worth $8million dollars and every second I don't give in to temptation makes me a richer person - I understand my self, my principles, and who I want to be. 

I only have one life. Why not enjoy it?

NoFAP is the definition of #YOLO.
You only live ONCE.  Why have sex with yourself when you can get bitches

I now notice other people who were once like I was and it makes me smile - A.Beacuse I am no longer them.
B. Because its so god dam simple to fix. 

I salute all of you.

I discovered NoFap just a few days ago

In a few months I'll be turning 30. I've been addicted to PMO for about 10 years. Each year my PMO addiction worsened

From a young age I fapped. I fapped even before I really understood what I was doing. But because I'm old(ish) I didn't have a high speed internet connection as a teenager. I had dial up until I was about 20. And even when the early high speed connections came along

But I digress...

In a 7th grade I finished with straight A's in school

By the time high school ended

When I think back to my life at age ~20, I was a bit short, and never had a dollar to my name - I had at least half a dozen girlfriends between the ages of 19 - 23. I had a certain 'happy-go-lucky' attitude. I wanted intelligent, creative, nice women. I didn't really care about cup size. 

Of course back then

At age 20 I wrote a novel (being a writer is my life's dream) - it was shit, played in bands...

But things got worse. My PMO increased (although I didn't realise I had a PMO addiction, and then they always went sour after that. 

But no doubt you're sensing a pattern of decline here.  

By the time I was 23 I had dropped out of uni. Twice. I had no girlfriend, and I was probably a borderline alcoholic. 

Over the next 7 or so years things just got worse. I went three years without so much as a kiss. *Three* years

I craved intimacy less

I started fapping to more extreme porn. Things got worse. I became weird and reclusive. My stuttering got worse. My life was an absolute mess. I was so lonely

All this time I blamed everything I could - my heavy alcohol drinking, ticking along in the background, getting worse and worse, was my PMO addiction. 

Finally things got so bad I just had to get out of there. So at age 26 I went backpacking around Europe for 4 months

After several years of anger, and PMOing until my arm hurt - I met a girl. We had an awful 18 month relationship while I was living overseas. We virtually never had sex. It took several attempts before we actually successfully had intercourse. I blamed issues with anxiety. Which was in part true. But looking back.. yep, you guessed it: porn induced ED.

So maybe she wasn't my soul mate, ready and willing. Basically I made both our lives miserable. 

Now I am 29. I re-enroled in uni last year, but recently gave them up in favour of natural remedies. I started exercising, using light therapy, getting Omega 3's and a bunch of other stuff - all of which helped. 

But there was something missing. 

I have no doubt that most of my sad story of decline is *directly correlated* to PMO addiction. At 29 years of age, I am still flunking higher education and I still don't have a dollar to my name. But to add insult to injury, I'm also old.  

As it turns out in about 90 days I will be turning 30. Just in time for a 90 day reboot. 

And I am at day 5!

TL;DR --- I am three months away from turning 30. I have fapped my life away. I have nothing: no degree, virtually no happiness. 

**Don't turn out like me**
**Don't turn out like me**

But you know what? 

I am optimistic about the future.

I slay one last demon

Best of luck Fapstronauts!

I present to you: The Game-Changer.",roeko,300,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1fkktd/today_is_my_cakeday_one_year_ago_i_joined_reddit/

A little backstory: next month I'll be 25 years old. I started fapping when I was 14

I've been through all kind of addictions: video games, alcohol. I'm handling a deep depression for years, and let's say the army service didn't help. And although I have depression and anxiety for years, I was able to kick every single one of my addictions....except one. I couldn't get over fapping. 

Even when I was in the Army (and military prison. shitty times) I couldn't help myself get over this addiction

I joined nofap a year ago

Porn is the perfect drug: if you think about like every other substance

1. In order for a drug to function, it's a rough guess). Heroin fits our brains about 60%-70%. Because of evolutionary reasons, porn fits our brain 100%. 

2. It's so common that it's not only socially acceptable (which is insane, in some period of history, heroin was used as a medicine. it was acceptable, common, EXPECTED. crazy, huh? is it crazier than using a drug that fits your brain 100%?

After truly understanding the effects of porn, I couldn't give up. I just couldn't. I hate the fact that unregulated media streams and inadequate educational systems could mold me into a person I don't want to be.

So I kept on reading and searching for ways to overcome my addiction. I subcribed to a website called [Fight The New Drug](http://www.fightthenewdrug.org). a few weeks ago they sent their subscribers a free book about getting out of the addiction. I haven't finished reading the book, this is the only thing that helped me. I sincerely hope it'll do the trick for you too.

Since I'm not sure I can legally copy and paste the material in the book

So here is it:

First, no one will ever, EVER, see the world from your eyes. You're the only one who's gonna go through this, and no one can do it for you. And as Churchill said: if you're going through hell - keep going.

**1.Learn the addiction cycle.** Our brains are ubiquitous - they're practically the same, memorize it. That's what happening again and again and again. On every arrow, you have an choice: continue running down the path, or break it. paragraph 3 will explain on the best weapon you can use to break the cycle. P.S. Consider ""Desire to escape/Triggers"" as ""Entertaining the idea of using"" - all the ""if I only do this.."", ""It's the last time.."", etc.

**2.Be mindful of what's happening in your body and brain:** what phase of the cycle are you on?

**3.After you understand where are you on the addiction cycle

**S.** Stop what you're doing. hands to the sides

**T.** Take 5 deep and long breaths. Watch as your lungs filled with fresh air. Relax. You are not your thoughts.

**A.** Ask yourself: what do you REALLY want to do? is it worth it to risk what you really want for what you want now?

**R.** React. The wheel is in your hands. You're the one in control. You're the only responsible man. Act like it.

Do the S.T.A.R right now. Do it as much as you want

**4.Replace the act with something else:**

**Meditate** - it will change your perspective on life. it will help you understand that you are not your thoughts. you are not your addictions. you are not the voice that tells you you suck. you are not your past.

**Exercise** - it will use your energy for good causes.

**Socialize** - you'll find that you're far less anxious as you were when you kept fapping your life away.

**Eat** - Look up at nutrition. Learn about how the food industry is a lot like the porn industry

**Stop smoking weed.** stop doing the half-ass shit your friends do. You are not your friends! [This](http://youtu.be/CcrhwatDkUM?t=7m16s) is the video that made me realize a lot about what I do in life. I recommend watching the whole video (It's also quite entertaining).


That's it. This is the method that gave me the power to go through 16 days without fapping. 

One last thing I would like to talk about is superpowers. A lot of fapstronauts talk about expecting superpowers. So

Everyone's different. For me, uncontrollable cries and sleep disorders. I couldn't care less about my life.

So in my case, I was so proud of myself I slept with a huge smile all night). 

See, by the way. humans don't have the power to really understand who they are. it's just our ego that tells us we can) is the first step to taking yourself further than you ever thought possible.

I hope it'll help you as much as it helped me. Have a nice day

* Edit: typos

* I forgot to add one thing: it gets better. Here's a metaphor: think of your ability to stop yourself from harmful actions as a button. at first, and using the S.T.A.R method to make the right choice, the button gets bigger. The next time you'll get an urge, it'll easier to push the button. over time, the button gets so big, that at times of urge you'll have the ability to kick it away quite easily. that's because our brains can change, and so is your will power.",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1fkktd/today_is_my_cakeday_one_year_ago_i_joined_reddit/

But in the last few years, co-workers, and industry, and I have come to the conclusion that a lot of it leads back to my porn addiction. 

I tried NOFAP for the first time, etc. But then I went out on Tuesday and met a busty groupie chick, who gave me her number. Got home, had a few drinks in me and busted one out in the bathroom over her Instagram account. The next day, went on a total binge, fapping three times, then fapped every day since at least once. 

So tonight, felt awful. Then I decided to delete the file.


And then I decided I should delete all of my porn. 


Everything, selected the drive, and hit ""erase"". Years of collecting were vaporized in an instant. Not pausing, I pulled the drive out of the docking station without powering it off. The bulky drive was still spinning. Out of it's dock, it started rotating, almost doing figure eight formations in my hands. I couldn't tell if this was a result of the pornocide I just committed, or if the drive was still spinning. The effect made me dizzy. Wish me luck.

Basically, work like a mule, and suffer with a smile on your face. We all have a sense of what a real adult is, and in our more reflective moments we sense how far away from that ideal our present condition is. This 'growing up' is what our natural survival instincts - the ones we develop during puberty - are for: to help us reach full manhood. All those hormones and chemicals that mature us give us a drive, a feeling of longing that basically amounts to the double edged sword of instinctive/sexual motivation: ""here's your secret energy - it's powerful, deadly stuff, could get you into trouble

But we've grown up sheltered by messages telling us life isn't a struggle, or maybe earning the status of 'village idiot' or 'vagrant', being a kidult today means you're allowed the external illusion of a normal life... but will it last? What's underneath that thin veneer of contentment?

So what about all those chemicals floating around our bodies - all that instinctual/sexual energy? If it doesn't get used to drive us towards our goals, doesn't feel right, after a while you feel like to explode. The energy has to go somewhere, and if it's to make something useful or creative then you'll need to apply effort. But that's what we're trying to avoid because of our whole fear-ignorance complex. So then conveniently enter the clever little suppression mechanisms - the ones that let us stay in our childhood cocoon, coast along and just about get by (in our fantasy... while in reality we fail slowly and bitterly). One of those sly mechanisms is masturbation and porn fantasy. It's a way of spending the sexual energy, using a fantasy world construction that others have cynically made for you, and hey you can feel good as long as you don't think too deep about it.

The result? You neatly get put in your place in society, a beta-male, inconsequential. You won't rock the boat and you won't use up alpha-males' valuable resources (jobs, fame, attention, women, money). And the tragic part is that it also works for you, the part that doesn't want to poke his head out of his burrow hole

NoFap may not change your life, addicted to porn, and playing at least 5 hours of league of legends every day.

I said something to myself that I may not recommend to anyone else

I promised I would kill myself.

I said I would give up every vice I had, 3 months, and see what I could do.

I stopped smoking

But it wasn't until I found NoFap that I actually made the connection. 

I had gone to a reunion for some of my old High School friends who all talked about how well they did in college and how not only did some of them have jobs lined up, only halfway through my quarter wishing I would just drop dead on the spot.

And then New Years came around. I went out with some friends and expected to try to hook up with some girls. Unfortunately I learned a lot about my friends that night and a lot about myself. After DDing all night and going from shitty bar to shitty bar
""I'd rather just go home and get high. That's not weird is it?"" 

I went home that night, NoFap. And January 1st, 2013, I made the final step to change my life. I quit fapping.

Since then, hard, but fun. I got straight Bs this quarter, better than I've ever done. I've fucked my girlfriend so much my dick got raw. I lost 20 pounds. I'm doing it guys.

Refraining from sexting and downloading porn.
The tube socks were stashed in my dresser with care
Not a single load would be blasted in there.
And as I was tucked quite tightly in bed
Random nothings abounded inside of my head.
The past few days I had felt like crap
But nothing so bad that would induce me to fap.



When all of a sudden I heard a loud bang
My neighbors next door were doing their thang.
Their moans did compel me to dig out my flash
Open the folders and run through my stash. 

Four gigs of pure unadulterated bliss
[Pussy] (/nsfw) and [ass] (/nsfw) and glorious [tits](/nsfw).
Next door the moans and the creaky
Swelled to a crescendo like my southernmost head.




The sounds of their passion consumed me like fire
Tortuously they stirred up my most secret desires.
And just when things seemed they could get no worse
My neighbors sang out like a chorus in church:



""Oh Baby! [blah blah blah] (/nsfw) with a miniature tuba
""And go [blah blah blah blah blah] (/nsfw) like a German in Cuba!""
To which her lover did aptly reply
""[Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah] (/nsfw)
with a fresh banana cream pie.""



Once,
My hand would not aide me in doing the same
Instead I parted with my secret stash
I deleted it all and emptied the trash. 




The suitemates next door could not make me to break
They had simply reminded me what was at STAKE.
Was a few minutes of beating my bone
Worth another day/month/year of forever alone?




Yes
For one to live freely and jerk it no more
So to all of my fapstronauts who have chosen to fight
Happy 90 to all and to all

The No Fap Hoax

TL;DR

YBOP, it’s almost always a sign of some other underlying problem (shame, anxiety, fear of rejection, relationship problems, boredom, low self-esteem, etc.). Addressing those underlying problems should be people’s focus

LONG VERSION
Before I get into the problems with YBOP, a bit about my background to show that I have some expertise in the area. I have PhD in psychology and have studied human sexuality extensively. I’ve published several first-authour papers in reputable peer-reviewed academic journals such as the Archives of Sexual Behaviour and the Journal of Sex Research. I teach a class on human sexuality at one of Canada’s top-ranked universities. I’m also part of a global email listserve that’s populated by many of the best minds (i.e., researchers, theorists and clinicians) in the field of human sexuality. YBOP, TGPE, and nofap have all been discussed extensively on the listserve (well, mostly criticized and ridiculed

On to YBOP

This whole movement stems entirely from the work of two people: Marnia Robinson and her partner Gary Wilson (R&amp;W). They are on a crusade against internet pornography. Wilson is a high school science teacher and adjunct instructor at Southern Oregon University, they’re not Drs.). YourBrainOnPorn.com is a pet project of theirs, tied into talks, books, articles, and Ms. Robinson’s therapy practice (Reuniting.info). They run YourBrainOnPorn.com. Wilson is the presenter of the TEDx talk, “The Great Porn Experiment”. R&amp;W regularly blog their work online at “Psychology Today, although I’ve heard rumblings that their gigue may be up. Robinson is also the co-authour of “Cupid’s Poison Arrow

If you do some digging, discussing indirect evidence as if it’s direct supporting evidence, and citing bad research.

R&amp;W are pariahs within the world of sex research and clinical practice. I’m not being an intellectual snob (or at least, perhaps future research will prove them to be correct (I doubt it).

R&amp;W make a litany of claims about the harms of internet porn use. I’ll address a few of the most egregious ones in an effort to keep this short enough that people will hopefully read it. Keep in mind

DOPAMINE AND BRAIN RE-WIRING
Dopamine plays a central in role in the neural networks of the brain that respond to reward. All rewarding (i.e., although brain development slows down as people enter into adulthood. All our experiences can potentially cause re-wiring, and our wiring influences the way we experience things (i.e., it’s a two-way street). This is a good thing.

The reward system has been the focus of much substance addiction research and many people have claimed that behavioural addictions have the same underlying neurological causes/effects. Within the larger research community, similar to what’s seen in substance addictions. Many people are very skeptical of behavioural addictions in general, such as internet addictions, sex addictions, porn addictions, etc., as there simply isn’t any strong evidence to show the same degree of brain changes that are seen in people with substance addictions. There are some addiction organizations in the states that equate behaviour and substance addictions; however

The most important point, their whole re-wiring hypothesis). R&amp;W have simply extrapolated from animal models of substance addiction and sexual behaviour (e.g., hamsters, sheep, rats, etc.) to humans watching internet porn. A great example of this is in the TGPE video. Wilson claims, “At the same time

INTERNET PORN CAUSES MENTAL DISORDERS
In the TGPE video, social anxiety and OCD. He opposes the prescription of medications to treat these disorders and states, “Guys don’t realize that they can overcome these symptoms simply by changing their behaviour [masturbation to internet porn].” As someone trained in psychology, I find this extremely problematic and entirely unethical. There are literally piles of peer-reviewed research showing that people with mental disorders and/or other psychological problems will often self-medicate with rewarding behaviour or substances. This is at the core of addiction. In other words, the rewarding behaviour (in this case masturbation to orgasm while watching porn) allows the individual to escape from the symptoms caused by his/her mental disorder or psychological problems. There is NO research showing that internet pornography causes mental disorders – none. It’s the other way around – psychological problems and mental disorders can lead to problematic porn use as a means to cope and self-medicate. Wilson is simply presenting his ideology as fact, and in this case, it’s dangerous. People should be seeking treatment for their mental disorders.

It's at the point where I feel like I need to explore other work options.  I am not going to go into management at my current job.  There isn't even enough money to be made in the first place- by a LONG shot.

Anyway

I APPLIED FOR A JOB THAT I WAS SEVERELY UNDER-QUALIFIED FOR.  

I had all this confidence and gusto and so I then just picked up the phone

I did and started all over again.  I told them of how I'm doing now and what I can bring to the table and expanded on stories of when I proved my excellence and all that good stuff.

I thought I killed it.  I walked away thinking YES!!  I NAILED THAT INTERVIEW!!  I'VE GOT THAT JOB FOR SURE!!

I started planning what I was going to do with 50% more money coming in every week.

They said that they would call me the next day.
I didn't hear from them.
I called them about 4:30 PM.

They said that they have decided to pass on me and instead have selected other more experienced candidates.

THIS IS WHAT I SAID.

What?  Are you serious?  You can't be serious.  There's no way.  That's impossible.  I would love to see who these candidates are because there is no way that they are any better than me.  No way.  Not a single one.  I've always done great in sales.  I'm at the top right now.  Not the top 10%.  The top 5%.  I'm the best.  There isn't anyone better than me.

He said

I told him.  It's not even worth mentioning because it is such a trivial item compared to what I would be selling.  Night and day.  Not enough experience means not enough experience.  Different widget.  Different animal.

I kept going.  I wouldn't shut the fuck up.  I went on about the other more complicated things that I was in charge of.  Things that were under my control.  If this motherfucker was going to push me under it was going to be after the biggest

He said

I wouldn't accept it.  I was going for broke and that was the only deal that I could see in my head.

Not a chance I said.  I want this job and I want it now.  Didn't I tell you about the time that I overcame........

This went on until he said

That works perfectly.  Thank you and I hung up.

They called today.

Social anxiety is not caused by PMO. It could be exacerbated by it, but  PMO is not the cause. Your inability to relate to women, your weight problem, your inactivity, your lack of ambition, your inability to get over an ex-girlfriend, etc.

NoFap won't fix everything in your life. NoFap will help you stop looking at porn and masturbating. Your sexual function will improve. You might spend more time doing other things

If you're fat, it doesn't know the difference between how you act and who you are. If you act a certain way, your brain assumes that's who you are. Act more confident, your brain thinks you're more confident, and it makes you more confident. You can't fix everything this way, but try it.

I'm in my forties and I assessed my life and didn't like what I found. I had a hostile relationship with my wife, I cursed all the time, I was angry, I watched a lot of porn and masturbated, I would sometimes hope I'd die soon, I didn't believe in anything anymore, I had no hope for the future.

Now the positives: There is absolutely nothing special about me. I'm about average in every way. But I decided to change things in my life. I stopped cursing, I don't blame everyone else for my problems anymore. I lost thirty pounds and have kept it off. I converted to Catholicism, I improved my relationship with my wife, I'm on my 90th day of no PMO. I haven't fixed everything in my life and I can still improve in many of the things I listed, but I've solved or nearly solved a lot of the things that screwed up my life and who I am. I have work to do, but I also have hope for the future again.

Don't blame porn and fapping for all of your problems and the condition of your life. It's something to be fixed, I can't fix your life, a therapist, or girlfriend can't fix your life. They can help, they can advise you, or encourage you, but you have to do it,,False,t3_1jafio

From reading this subreddit it's very easy to spot a common trend amongst the big majority of NoFappers. Everyone who took some time and invested some energy in this knows the *entire theory* behind NoFap

Knows that NoFap is right

Why does this happen and how to finally succeed?

**Part 1 - Complete understanding of the NoFap idea and an understanding of your motivations**

I'll make this easy for myself and just point you to this link:

**http://www.young-goddess.com/**

Don't worry, sexual energy and celibacy.

Read the entire text carefully and you **will** completely understand the entire idea behind NoFap. 

And when you understand the idea, you'll find the reasons to do NoFap and you really should have an intrinsic motivation. It is an incredibly written text and covers male sexuality in a way never seen in modern society, the true way.

**Part 2 - Conquer your mind

After step 1, and you wouldn't do it even if you had porn playing in front of you.

Then what happens? The early motivation wanes, have a sexy dream and all of a sudden, you're relapsing. 

It feels fucking great.

For the first minute or two. That's the sudden onrush of missing dopamine caused by too much masturbation and then a sudden cessation of the practice for longer than what your brain likes period of time. 

Then the dopamine stops rushing. It flatlines. It stops feeling good mid-fap. You eventually orgasm.

Regret ensues.

**How to avoid this?**

Remember

1. Do not, touch yourself sexually. Not even a little.

2. Do not look at porn
**Note:** Don't even fantasise in your mind. Just don't.

**What about sudden rushes of urges and dopamine

What is - ""the haze""? It is a state of mind in a male

The ""haze"" is very powerful but since we as humans can think and are a bit more advanced than animals

I recommend **[The S.T.A.R. Method](http://i.imgur.com/LX4QG7U.jpg)** 

**Part 3 - How to ""orgasm"" with NoFap and make it a natural part of your life (forever)**

If you follow the above two rules and completely avoid any sexual stimuli which isn't a real woman you will have
huge amounts of pent up sexual energy in you. Which brings us to this:

**[Sexual Transmutation](http://www.sacred-texts.com/nth/tgr/tgr16.htm).** 

Read it


It's important to be conscious and aware of potential triggers and situations. It's important to be able to predict

What do I mean by ""orgasming"" with NoFap?

Well, get back into the habit of fapping 3 times a day and get back to being a human zombie?

That's why we use Sexual Transmutation which you've read up on.

**Read slowly and carefully:**

The urge you feel when you are horny and want to fap/have sex is **NOT** strictly the urge to cum. It is not an urge to have sex or masturbate.

***You don't need to have sex or masturbate ever again in your life and you'll be just fine.***

But what is it then?

Despite not needing sex/fap and being completely fine without it

**You have to discharge your sexual energy through an outlet.** Be it sex, music, whatever art, hobby or sport you're into, the sexual energy *MUST* be discharged.

As the text says
Through sexual transmutation you achieve ""orgasm"" by discharging your sexual energy without actually losing your vital life force on nothing and bombarding your brain with mind shifting dopamine from porn.

You still get horny

 *Does it sound familiar?*

Well, this or that...this is a pure guide on how to succeed in NoFap. NoFap is a continous process and as such it has to be managed, otherwise you will fail.

The reason I am creating this thread is that I'm hoping it can be used for informational purposes to those struggling with pmo addiction and or ED.  I could write a book on my experiences over the last four months, though, that it will still qualify as FRAT).

First and foremost, and despite the fact that I felt intensely aroused and into the experience, my penis would be small, shriveled, and, in that moment, essentially useless.

I began NOFAP and made my goal 90 days.  I ended up making it just past 100.  I can say that it is not easy to make it to 90 days.  It takes a full on commitment.  If you are going in even 90 percent committed, but during this time, I was asexual.  While that may sound like a bad thing, it really made NO FAP 90 much easier to achieve than I had anticipated. And trust me, your desire for women will return to you-- and it will do so like a punch across yout face.  One day you will just be like ""damn I need to fuck.""

I'm not going to lie.  There were some nights where I was damn sleepless because I was so horny and my body was clamoring for pmo.  I was so committed, traded my Droid phone in for a basic phone without internet capability, threw away and loaned out all my porn, slept in my clothes, only touched my penis when cleaning it in the shower and urinating, refrained from watching tv shows and movies with sexy women as I might have been tempted to fap, when I did see something sexy I would be sure to look away; stayed extremely busy as I knew that time alone would equal fap temptation.  Of exceptional importance, ANYTHING

After about two months, that I was on the right path.

I finally fapped a little past 100 days, blowjob, and striptease (which I masturbated to) from a 4th woman.  I can say that, for the most part, I had almost immediate erections with these women.  It was unbelieveable.  I literally did not have to think about my erection-- it was just there.  It felt as simple and natural as the blood flowing through my veins, the beat of my heart; my liver and kidneys doing their jobs.  My brain had successfully reset-- and it felt great.  Even when just kissing these women, I had immediate and unbelieveably hard erections.

I want to let those of you know who are about to start this journey that NOFAP 90 is legit.  It saved me.  It is a free and attainable cure for a serious ailment.  The number 90, it may take 200.  I think it depends on how long one has been viewing porn, how often one viewed porn during that period of time, and how hardcore/abnormal the type of porn viewed was.  Whatever the case, this is the cure.  Do it.  It is worth it.

Regarding all the other benefits of NO FAP, of sorts.  I did feel generally happier, more independent, and more confident.  I do believe some of that had to with a change in chemicals in my brain and body.  However, I think some of those experienced changes are due to me feeling that I was conquering my problem-- not from the conquering of the problem in and of itself.

I do need to add that I have recently fallen off the wagon, of sorts, that one experiences.  Like someone eating a meal who hasn't eaten in a week, one will likely gorge oneself.  In effect, that is what I did recently with porn.  The sad reality, here, is that once addicted, confidence

Good luck guys.  Fight the good fight.  Stop jerking off.  Not only is it bad for you

Think of it this way: when it's all said and done and you are at the very end of your life, truly, fucking gave it your all to live life, to experience-- that you positively took advantage of the brief amount of time you were given on this planet?

Good luck guys.

However, it was to me. I rediscovered porn - particularly S&amp;M porn, which really got me off. At that time, I used PMO as an outlet for the depression I had. Any free time I had, if I was not at extra classes, I was in my room, *pretending* to study. I became addicted to a routine ; I would have a porn video playing, it gave me pleasure which I drowned myself in. 

4 years - I would spent the next 4 years edging and orgasming every day, and I would be wiping myself, sometimes I would cry. I would feel horrible, and it felt exactly like a crash after a high. I felt lonely, sad, and even more depressed with every fap. I would think back on my virgin self, and an overwhelming sense of self-pity would wash over me. I would think of my parents, curtains drawn

This year, and gentle, and wonderful. I would observe him pouring coffee so skillfully every day, and swoon every time he spoke. He is amazing. He makes me smile, and he makes me laugh, and he's a sarcastic asshole, and he makes me cry. For the first time in so many years

I confessed to him about my routine, and at that moment, I told myself : I would change, no more excuses. But time and time again, I would relapse and relapse and relapse - and every time I did, I would be filled with this pang of guilt.

I confessed to him about my true feelings for him - and he rejected me. For a while

We didn't talk after that. And when he saw me again

This week, not for others. He told me he didn't want to be my motivation, and because of that, we will not be seeing each other again. He wanted me to be motivated by my own well-being and at that very moment, I cried - because I knew he truly cared for me, and that his decision to never contact me was final. He was smiling when he left.

They were all women that I was genuinely interested in but I had one unusual problem.  I never wanted to have sex with them.  I was a virgin at the time and all of my friends were telling me I had to loose it

I didn't really have any of this in mind when I started nofap but it hindsight there is a definite link.  A few months into my first streak (right around 90 days actually) I started hooking up with a new girl.  From the very first time we kissed I could tell I was attracted enough to her to go all the way.  I had never really felt that way before.  It was incredible.  This new level of attraction is yet to fade.

It's my theory that porn programmed my brain to be attracted to 2D pornstars rather than real women.  Sexuality and romance were completely unrelated concepts in my mind.  I could never be romantic with a pornstar and I could never be sexual with a real woman.  It made sense at the time.

Now that I have been doing nofap for close to a year my outlook has changed quite a bit.  I don't have romantic or sexual feelings about pornstars and I have both romantic *and* sexual feelings for my girlfriend.

It's truly an amazing feeling and I'm grateful for it every day.  If you're ever questioning whether or not nofap is worth it,,False,,t5_2skrn,False,,True

1. My wife informs me that she was pulled over for having unregistered plates. We know the plates were not registered and we literally could not get the money to do it because we are in a new state and some stuff happened that I don't want to go into detail, and failure to change state license after 30 days. The ironic part is that her mom surprised us today with the money to get it all taken care of, but now a ticket must be paid as well.

2. I have to cancel a party I was planning for weeks because now we have to do all sorts of running around tomorrow in an unregistered car to get everything straightened out before the court date and hopefully maybe get the ticket lowered to only $260.

3. My tuition looks like it will have to go unpaid therefore forcing me to drop out of school after I have already completed half of my degree.

4. I have been looking for work and unfortunately I have not yet landed a job and so because of this my wife has to do pay all these bills while I have to sit back and watch her cry.

It could be that some assholes bullied me in high school. It could be shame from my fap-related habits. But as it turns out I'm better at conversation than I imagined

2.) **Reading is underrated.** One problem I encountered my last attempt was that I had no idea what to do with my alone time. I inevitably went on facebook, then relapsed. The internet is so flashy and satisfying I feel as though half of my porn addiction is internet addiction. I've started reading again after a long hiatus from it and I've found it's a great thing to pass the lonely hours. And, not to be cliche, but it really does expand the mind, make you smarter, and give you more to talk about. The more you read stories the better you become at telling them, and everyone values a good storyteller in their lives.

3.) **I didn't notice the positive benefits of NoFap until I stopped doing it.** I had never gotten a major streak going, I went back up to 8 a week, and I started to feel sluggish and unmotivated. Then I'd take a day off, and I'd feel great again. Basically what I'm trying to get at is that NoFap works and you hardly even realize it. If you were a chronic masturbator and you're here now I can almost promise you feel better now than you did before you started, no matter what your mind tries to tell you. This goes along with the next one:

4.) **Fapping is definitely a problem.** It may not be *the* problem. It may not even be the biggest problem. But my life is not being lived to its highest potential because of PMO. So no matter what my brain tells me when I'm at my lowest low about how how fapping isn't a problem, I know now that I can beat the urge.

5.) **You guys are fucking awesome.** Blatant pandering. But still, always ready and willing to give advice or support or whatever a fellow fapstronaut needs. That's an invaluable tool.

1360418800.0,186x3r,4 types of men,melech_alderamin,295,61,91,"Time for change, just playing with some ideas I have.

There are 4 stages a guy can go through in life. Some men stay in stage 2, there is a magic in this, a magic far better than the six second orgasm spasm we have after jerking off to porn. Transforming your life through willpower.

Here are the four stages:

* Stage 1: Boy/Young man
* Stage 2: Man
* Stage 3: Prince
* Stage 4: King

Let’s get further in to that. At stage 1 you are a boy, As he grows up, he physically changes, but in his mind he’s still a boy, or rather a young man. The next step would be a man, however there are a lot of guys not ready for that stage yet. Not knowing what they want in life, who they want to spend their time with and just messing around. Not a problem of course, so you can slack off a bit. 
Maybe a bit controversial, my equipment would let me down. That’s when I saw this subreddit and immediately knew I had to try it. After a few weeks, I’m entering stage 2: Man.

I take my time seriously when I need to, I was afraid of driving for so long. Now I know why: I didn’t have a clear, concentrated mind. Now I do. My life is turning into the good road, but I’m not there yet. To be a man, it’s important that you take responsibility. You don’t hide behind a mask, so people will like you. You are the guy people will want to talk to. As a man, you’ll be saying to woman what you want to do with them. You will never again hear yourself saying: ‘I don’t know

Becoming a man is necessary, loving men. I say loving, because the real man portrayed by the media isn’t the real men we need. The media man, he is strong, masculine, loves sports and cars, and gets with many women. Sounds fun right? Except, always trying to be the better man, I need to step up a get a level higher.

So you manned up, but why not going all in? The next stage is a prince. Why not king? Well, to become a king, you better be a prince first. A prince is someone who has his life together, a happy guy enjoying life. Not caring about others opinion. You envy those guys whenever you see them. Why? Because you struggle to talk to a girl, and he laughs at her and she is overwhelmed by his charm. Why can’t I be that guy? Because you are still in stage 1, my boy. Look and learn from princes. The prince is the best version of yourself. The prince is preparing for his kingdom, your family? Or can it be that you’re able to do both? The prince is the guy you want to be. Fun, you can be crowned
	
Then what is a king, even the people he doesn’t know. This is the gentleman, the king of the world. He respects everybody, even the people he won’t be getting anything of. The king is the best version of yourself, plus all the valuable lessons you learned from your own heroes. Whoever your hero is, incorporating their life lessons in your life will make you an even better man than you were. The king also creates the world around him, making his own wishes come true.
Now I’m still in stage 2. And I’m happy, to become a king, become a prince first. 

And maybe most important of all, I don’t need to tell you what that was. Everybody doing this: Stay strong, you will feel a lot better after a while, there is nothing more powerful than the feeling of complete awareness and control!",,False,,False,t3_186x3r

Sex is incredibly salient in popular media today, imo) who appears to be getting off on telling the audience how much he likes to get off. There's a never ending stockpile of female entertainers whose image is strictly, scientifically and insidiously designed to be sexually appealing and whose every song is either about a relationship or a breakup. And you can't blame these people when consumers eat that shit up. There are men and women who want to have more going for them than catchy stock tunes and one dimensional content but sadly, they have to work harder to be successful and more often than not they don't have as large a return because they don't have a monster sized industry supporting them.

And this is in no way limited to music. Sex and relationships are sold to us through television, magazines, fashion, and just about any other form of popular media you can imagine. You name it, someone appears to have thought up a way to make it give you a boner. Frankly, it's ridiculous.

Not to mention literally so unreal. For the longest time, and I'd get severely depressed about it. But I wasn't really drawing that conclusion from the actions of those around me. I was drawing that conclusion from what I've been told dating and sex are from the media I'm surrounded by. There's so much smut out there that you start to think *something's wrong with me* if your life isn't smut and how fucked is that?! There is absolutely nothing wrong with me; nothing worth getting depressed over anyway. 

I think one of the best things about nofap is once you decide to step away from the idea of sexuality as a product, it's not really about that anymore. *I've learned to embrace being single*, and each time I break my record I'm closer to having better self control and a life which is governed by fewer vices. I'm closer to being an unbridled, unabated me. And no pop song, movie, commercial or TV show is **ever** going to break that down.

I am making this post for a couple of reasons: 1) I hope that seeing someone make it almost a year without fapping will inspire some of our new fapstronauts (my story is somewhat inspiring

I know many people start this thinking it will give you ""superpowers."" The thing is, at friends houses, even at my grandmother's house. I was disgusted with myself and my need to ejaculate ruled my life. It didn't matter what I was doing, if I got the urge it wouldn't go away until I had fapped. So I set out to correct it. 

Yes, and yes that was one of the reasons I started my Fapstronaut journey. However, it wasn't until I realized that I had a problem and I needed a real lifestyle change that my NoFap tendencies stuck. I relapsed four or five times over the course of June before I committed myself to working out and pushing thoughts of sex from my mind. Any time I got the urge to masturbate I would immediately get up and do some physical activity: basketball, lifting, running, biking, walk in the park, whatever I needed to do to get my mind off of it. 

I also decided to tackle my procrastination, working out, homework, writing a song (I make music as a hobby), or just getting up out of bed in the morning I immediately jumped up and did it. I didn't let my urge to be lazy override what I needed/wanted to do. This is important. This is the mind set you need to not relapse. You have to be of the mind that you won't *allow* yourself to do something you don't really want to do. Be the master of yourself, don't let *anything* control what you do other than your own will to do it. 

Using these methods I was fap free all summer (no small feat, normally I would have been too shy to talk to her, too scared to make the first move. But this is where the supposed ""superpowers"" kick in if you hold off of fapping long enough (this includes edging, don't cheat yourself). I talked to her and got her number from my roommate who had gotten it (they were both smokers) and invited her over to watch our school's football game that weekend. She said yes! Long story short, we kissed that night and now I am no longer a virgin and I have my first girlfriend. We have been together ever since, and she is absolutely amazing. She loves the fact that I don't masturbate. She's told me so many times that she thought she was just going to have to accept that she wouldn't be the only woman getting her man off, but with me she knows she is and that means the world to her. I love her. We just moved into our first apartment together

Thank you NoFap, if you put in the work you will get out of it the most amazing quiet confidence. This is because you know you are the master of yourself, that you have self control. That you can overcome your addictions and inadequacies. But you get out of it what you put in. I am a firm believer that you cannot edge if you want NoFap to work for you. Don't look at porn.

I use to be able to last longer than four hours wearing a condom. After years of PMO I discovered that sex with condom made me feel absolutely nothing, I just felt a minor thing. I knew something was wrong, and I kind of knew it had something to do with daily PMO. I tried stopping but I wasn't sure if it would help, so I didn't. Not until I discovered Gary Wilson by accident.


**What turned me on before in comparison to now?** (*best be careful while reading

Regular porn didn't do it anymore, different holes, it just didn't suffice anymore. Someone trolled me by sending a shemale porn video, and that did it. A woman that wasn't really a woman, the idea turned me on. This fetish stuck on me for many years (maybe five or six). It didn't go stale because I took pleasure in hunting for shemales that looked exactly like girls, with or without male genitalia. I knew it was hurting my sexuality, but I just continued. I pondered over whether or not I was gay, if a girl so much as glance at my general direction it turns me on. Not only that, bye"". Today is the completely opposite

**What other changes have you noticed?**

I ain't going to say I'm anxiety free. But it did diminish like 80% from what it use to be. At this pace I will be anxiety free pretty soon. So

* Much less anxiety

* Boner anytime

* Confidence

* Desire to meet people and to go out (I wasn't as SAP as some of you

* 100% increase in sensibility

* Women detection radar (every girl within a thirty yard radius will be noticed immediately)

* 100% increase in focus (no more ADHD like symptoms


During this time I went in and out of a relationship


**What happened when I fapped?**

When I fapped every day (several times per day), I felt zero desire to try anything with them, because I was always 'satisfied' sexually. As a teenager I went through a period where I fapped about ten times a day (and this is no exaggeration, sometimes it would be more than that), as I grew older, it got to a steady three to four times a day, every day. I had panic attacks for a while, then extreme ADHD symptoms (where I couldn't focus on anything

Changed my life from head to toe (I literally bulked up, especially the delicate ones, makes me want to embrace and protect them. Guys, it's damn worth it, don't give up.

Let me begin by saying that the chaser effect is quite real and very strong.  I'm not saying to not enjoy sex

A bit about myself

On to the benefits:

1.  Massively increased ability to concentrate for hours.  Wow.  This alone is worth the price of admission.
2.  An increased appreciation of the beauty of natural everyday women.  
3.  Renewed interest in my hobbies
4.  Even less anxiety talking to attractive women.  Fuglies were never a  problem
5.  More masculine and centered.  Even the tone of my voice seems deeper
6.  Less lethargy, but I feel like I give off a better 'vibe' than before.  

How I did it

1. Cold cold showers each day.  Yes
2. Avoid porn/nsfw stuff completely.  For the best results.
3. Do not masturbate - just don't do it.
4. Don't bother telling your friends about it
5. Cut out reddit
6. Concentrate on your projects: health, music, social skills, etc.
7. Say 'yes' to every opportunity to socialize!

It is my opinion that the sex drive is good and natural.  It is a motivator for mankind to bring forth great achievements.  It must be channeled and utilized and not wasted with fantasy and masturbation.  Others might disagree, meet girls/guys whatever.  Get out there!

NoFAP is not a magic pill.  I see it as just one of the basic components of being a true and complete man.  I have no intention of going back to chronic PMO.  If I do relapse

Edit: I am 40.  Before NoFAP

Edit: I did not experience ED before noFAP.  Wow

Edit: I take icy cold showers.  No hot water at all.  And I stay under until my breathing normalizes and my skin feels 'hot'.  This is when you acclimate to the cold-shock.

Yes, and I enjoy being free from my porn addiction. But does it completely change you as a person? No. No it fucking does not. YOU change yourself as a person. Yes, you get a temporary testosterone boost after 7 days, and that may motivate you to get off your ass once in a while. But that is the **only** scientifically proven benefit to what we are advocating here, besides the obvious effects on dopamine levels, which have not been linked to any behavioral effects. Yes, I know there haven't been many studies done. But the emptiness in the scientific realm is being filled with ridiculous, does this sound familiar?

The rest of the claims made here, and your new-found super powers will grant you unquestionable charm, wit, and power. That is just. not. true.

However, relating more and more astounding effects. Then newbies come and read these effects, are **amazed** by the promise, and then believe they are having the same results because they read about exactly what should happen to them.

But it isn't based on science. It's based on personal anecdotes that are deliberately fluffed up in order to draw **upvotes from brainwashed newbie NoFappers** who jizz at the thought of being a more assertive person. And the process is really spiraling out of control.

Anyone remember the game KOTOR? When everyone in the underworld of Taris was longing for the ""promised land"". That's what you guys remind me of. And it's really

EDIT 2: I'm pleased with the response so far. One of the main answers to my criticism is:
&gt; So what? Who cares if its a little overboard? Who cares if its a placebo? Its making people feel better

No, and when you forsake those ideas on an irrational path towards some promised, superior state of being, you are going to end up disappointed. It is important to keep in mind that porn addiction is a relatively modern phenomenon. In fact, it has only been around in any significant form since the invention of recorded video, and has only been widespread since the invention of the Internet.

Before porn addiction, reclusive, and cowardly people. Yet the priests of NoFap are promising cures to all these ails. All quitting porn is doing is returning you to **normal**. And normal doesn't mean ""confident and commanding"" for everybody. True confidence comes from accomplishments, and although you may trick yourself into feeling astoundingly more confident by just quitting porn, that's all it is. A trick; a placebo. I granted in my first post that I did feel some boost in my confidence. That is true. It seems to be a very common effect for many NoFappers. But lets not jump to conclusions here and say that correlation is equivalent to causation. Perhaps less time masturbating = more free time = more activities = more accomplishments = more confidence? Therefore quitting porn doesn't intrinsically lead to buckets of confidence, but rather extrinsically; you cannot forsake the other steps involved after quitting the porn itself.

**So what do I recommend we do?**

Downvote. And more importantly, because those who fail to gain the promised effects are going to be discouraged, think the **entire** thing is a sham, *which it isn't*, and go right back to porn.",,False,t5_2skrn,True

*If you've gone more than 2 weeks

**GIANT WALL OF TIPS BEGINS NOW**

The best way I've found to keep a good streak is to start a good streak. Anything less than a week is horrible because its very easy to say ""a week is so little time, even less because it takes a long time to make back 2 weeks of work, THAT'S A MONTH BY THE TIME YOU'VE GOTTEN BACK TO WHERE YOU WERE BEFORE.


My best tips right here right now just for you.

1) Write down the reasons you are doing nofap and keep them close, otherwise it will seem pointless and you will give up. Only after fapping do you remember all the reasons you didn't want to and you get frusturated.


2) You get the intense craving to the point where you've already decided to fap, if nofap is actually not worth it, it still won't be worth it tomorrow and I can fap as much as I like."" The thing is, tomorrow you're always really really thankful you waited. It never works out that the next day you were happy about it, this technique has probably saved me 6 times during this current record I have going.


3) Get a streak going! Seriously, you're in the gold man. That 2 week badge is just inspiring and it takes a long time to get there and the commitment to go 5 days compared to the commitment to go 2 weeks is massive. I'd say going 2 weeks does almost as much as going a month for example, while going 5 days does about as much as going 2 days.

4)**My edit tip because I forgot** Don't seek out porn type vices. Notice I didn't say porn, basically ANYTHING THAT IS INTENTIONAL VISUAL AROUSAL THE WAY PORN WAS. If you happen to be watching a show and there's nudes you don't have to turn it off, just don't rewatch that part 1,000,000 times. Accidentally seeing some nsfw content isn't as bad as intentionally going out and searching for things that despite not being porn, are still fuelling your addiction.

These are my best tips. Write down your reasons for nofap because you will forget them and think nofap is pointless, not only does this get you another day which is awesome, but you'll never actually give in if you do this. The temptation to fap is entirely chemical and if you sleep it off the next day you'll be back to your current mindset, inspired by nofap and wanting to be done with that. Use these 2 tips to go a week, you'll feel good after a week and it'll feel like a nice accomplishment. THIS DOESN'T MEAN TO GIVE UP. At this point, you have to do it again, you have to use the 2 tips to go another full week. The first 2 weeks is hardest, its a self-fulfilling prophecy. The less time you've gone into nofap the easier it is to reset. Good luck man

P.S. last note, not the other way around, focus on reaching 2 weeks and I think you'll see the massive difference. 90 days sounds impossible because you're only seeing it from the week 1 perspective of horniness, at the 2 week perspective of horniness 90 days seems much more attainable. Trust me from experience.

TL;DR: Laziness won't get you fapless

This is something that I hope another me doesn't have to go through without knowing again.

--------------------------------------------------------------------


First of all when you enter into a nofap lifestyle you should know why you want to do this. Make sure you have a clear goal in order to remember the reasons of your actions.

- Now a lot of people now a days seem to be doing this for the sheer of getting laid/losing virginity which is a nice end goal

- Don't tell everyone of what you're doing, these people could be your friends, siblings and etc.... So just keep your goals to yourself.

- Always stay busy

- Now if you're going through exam week or if you have a very difficult course load I wouldn't recommend going through nofap till you finish putting those off

- Now one thing that almost everyone forgets about here is working out

- Always hang out with friends specially on the days you're most idle

- Now for a lot of people doing nofap is easy for the first couple of months because it's not the fap itself that causes them to crave orgasm but it's porn itself. Delete your stash when you're ready to do so

- For reddit there is Reddit enhancement tool which can also block nsfw links. 

- Develop a strong willpower by doing other things such as cleaning up your diet, do laundry and other things you'd enjoy doing.

- Sign up for chains.cc and every night instead of wanking put a little dot in there and fall sleep. 

- Stick to this for more than a week and the hardest part is almost over then you'd flatline and then you'd get your sex drive back up again use that energy into something that you'd enjoy that doesn't involve porn or wanking.

- Don't fool yourself

- Remember you're healing your brain and making yourself a better person

- Re-frame your urges

- If you hate something about yourself then change it.

- This is not the magic pill to solve everything in your life, you'd look around everyone and you'd be like ""hmm... they're all sleep and I'm awaken.""

- Whenever you come across a nsfw material

- Get a squeeze ball and release your stress on that whenever you get an urge

- So don't sit alone by yourself in your room trying to find an end result that ends in a fap a night till you fall sleep. Just stay active and get out there

If you guys have tips of your own add it into the comments and lets help each other.

Best of luck in your journey

I've always had to start looking at more and more extreme sites to get my fix. I thought that was normal. I realize now that I have never procrastinated or blown off work in my life as much as I do now. I also now realize that I have never spent so much time watching porn as I do now. I now realize that what I watch to get me off is sick and shameful. 

I hit a wall when I realized that the only time I really initiated sex with my girlfriend was when we were watching porn together. I never try it otherwise. I'm never really into it

For some reason, but have always been too embarrassed to face. Because until today, this was not a real world problem. It was something that right wing nutjobs brought up as propaganda. It was something that I joked about with my buddies ""Yeah bro I'm a total porn addict lolololol."" To me, this was not a real condition that people have. I finally saw the truth after the hours and hours of research I've done today. I finally believe it after reading all the studies and research. Even my suspected ADD and focus issues are explained by this problem. 

I have realized that I am the epitome of an addict, I must abstain. 

Thank you for listening.

It's not hurting anyone.

You need it badly? Yes

You're dead wrong.

Your instinct driven BRAIN wants it badly. Your brain's chemicals are all outta whack

STOP AND LISTEN TO YOUR BRAIN. DO IT. 
SERIOUSLY LISTEN TO YOURSELF.

(""you need this. you need this. you need this."")

YOUR BRAIN WANTS IT SO BADLY. 
But deep inside you KNOW you don't want it.

Just stop and think for a second. Just think about what is at stake here. Your dream. Your wonderful dream of a beautiful, and share beautiful and fun moments with. Someone to keep warm in the cold nights, with her snuggled up against you, protecting her from the dangers of the world. A fragile and beautiful woman.

Not a picture of a girl on a screen who you just use then throw away. Women are not objects

Which is why you should STAND UP NOW AND SAY:

SHUT THE FUCK UP SCUMBAG BRAIN!! NOBODY LIKES YOU!!
YOU CAN'T HAVE WHAT YOU WANT!!
YOU ARE NOT THE ONE IN CONTROL OF MY LIFE!!! 
I AM.


NOW GET THE FUCK OUT OF YOUR FANTASY

I wanted to give an update on my ""new normal"" as well as a few words of encouragement for those on this self-improvement journey.


Today is my 180th day of avoiding PMO. I am 33 years old and when I look back at my past porn habit I am ashamed of how much time I have wasted. PMO was a habit for me, all while feeling weak to my own urges. I viewed women as sexual beings only, and secretly hated myself and felt unworthy of love. If this is also your story fellow Fapstronaught... take heed: there is hope.


After finding out about NoFap (from 4chan of all places) I read up and watched the Your Brain On Porn videos. I then understood that part of my problem was willpower... the other part was addiction. When I understood my behavior as an addiction like any other (to cigarettes


It was not easy at first. I had physical pains and withdrawal symptoms in the fist week. There was a literal burning sensation in my groin that wanted release. I stuck with it. I relapsed a few times but now, and neither should you.


I started on ""hard mode"" (no gf) but after a few weeks I met this new and amazing girl who will become my wife in a few months (we are engaged!). It was difficult to transition into a relationship as years of self abuse using porn had desensitized me sexually with DE as well as mentally. There was a period of resetting to my ""new normal"" which is what I now live everyday. Here are some things I now enjoy that I did not before:


* Improved mental clarity - there is a mental fog that used to follow me around blurring and dulling my sight and other senses. I feel more alert and sensitive to the world now.

* More productive time - I used to have a routine of coming home from work, to cook together, to play with the dog, to enjoy our time instead of waste it.

* Self esteem - I used to avoid social situations and even going out with friends as my anxiety worsened. This social anxiety was rooted in feelings of unworthiness. I did not feel I had anything useful to contribute to conversations and my presence was a burden to others. Not anymore. I speak from my heart and am bold in my actions - I have re-discovered the man I was years ago.

* More in control of emotions and life - Before I would feel like I had little control of my daily life and that my insular routine was keeping me ""safe"" - in fact my sheltered existence was wasting my life away in a daily grind that only served to fulfill my base animal desires (eat

I hope others in this sub reddit stay on course and benefit themselves the way I did. I used NoFap as a starting point to bettering myself and my life. I have leaned that no one is a lost cause and we are all able to be better people. NoFap gives you a sense of self-pride which will carry over into other aspects of your daily life. Other people will notice a difference in your posture

1370118058.0,1fhbdr,Story from a lady's perspective.,,251,34,60,"So I started masturbating when I was about 5 years old.  My sister is 8 years older than I am, at school, but you should only do it in private

I masturbated every single day for my entire adolescence and up through high school and college.  Sometimes I'd masturbate a few times in a row and in strange places (e.g. under the bed at my grandma's house).  When I started working I'd masturbate in the bathroom at work at least once a day to break up the monotony of the afternoon.

It took me a while to get involved with porn, I'd also be really unsafe and reckless in real life, hooking up with random people just for the hell of it.  I couldn't think about anything but sex most of the time.

During times when I would have a regular sex partner, my mind would often be thinking about fantasies I'd collected from porn or other means, rather than being in the moment in reality with my partner.

This year I've become really disgusted with my habits.  I feel like my energy has been completely sapped and my mind and focus are fragmented.  Concentration on anything substantial has been difficult

Luckily

My benefits are:

**Energy** - You can't even imagine how much energy I've gained since I've started the nofap challenge - the effect is mindblowing. When I'm not working out in the gym

**Wet dreams** - I haven't had any. At first I was pretty disappointed by it

**Discipline** - My self-discipline has skyrocketed. If I want something done I get it DONE. No slacking

**Social skills** - I'd like to thank Seddit for helping me to become a better social person. I've read alot from Seddit's website and learned alot. I'm currently engaged in 4 female and numerous male friendships

**Fitness** - My goal in fitness is to finish a half marathon in one day in rowing. I've found rowing to be extremely fun and challenging! The only thing I'd say to those people considering fitness: Find something that YOU enjoy! Not something someone said you should do because of the huge muscles you would get. You need to find that one thing that YOU enjoy

**The Beauty in women** - The first things I noticed when I began my nofap challenge

**Sexual desires** - Right now I want to go out there and FIND a mate for me. MY sexual desire has never been higher

Looking back on the past 90 days, things have been hard on the road to where I am today, but that is nothing compared to reward at the finish line. And I'm not talking about fapping.

For all you fapstronauts out there: Keep it up! I know you can do it! No giving in! No surrender! **NoFap!**

After a couple weeks you will wake up and start singing as you put on your shoes. Head out the door to the corner store for a gatorade and hope to find someone on the way for a little pointless chit chat. Then you will slap your forehead as you realize what just happened because your alarm for 9am is going off. You disable your emergency 10 and 11am alarms and smile as you look at how bright the trees look

That doesn't last forever, just ride it out. If you fap you will only have to face another flatline. Your energy will return quite a bit :-)

Then... you will inevitably fap out of curiosity, self acceptance, and the inner workings of your cogs and chemicals. Nofap's all engulfing significance will begin to shrink to a more realistic level, it will fit in with your other healthy routines or might even begin the chain of healthy routines you've been trying to start for the last few years. Something so close to you, so primal, and so powerful begins to break under your reigns. You will gain perspective on a drug addict. You will learn monk's disciplines. You will know one of the the most personal struggles you could have. You will feel raw weakness. And for this experience you will always have that one little extra advantage in the face of your future challenges.

You will get horny. Really. Really. Horny. You have to learn to control it

To succeed at nofap you will need to make it a lifestyle

Lets talk about ""super powers"". Some people here claim to gain them, mundane things that were a challenge become a breeze and that can really blow someone's mind. they think simply not touching their dick has granted them something they didn't have before. well, it did. 

The chemicals at play, which will cause a brain fog/depression/lethargy. You all know Testosterone. it is expended during ejaculating, as well as zinc, a precursor to testosterone. However, implications of excessive masturbation on testosterone have not been studied and we can only speculate. We try to keep these two chemicals in abundance to keep a positive outlook and full of energy.

If you don't get the superpowers, such as sports or a solid girlfriend or whatever, your benefits from nofap will be less than say a cave-dweller. The super-powers are all very much(mostly) real. just because a testimony isn't like yours doesn't mean its not real. Lets all be nice to eachother :)

I covered what I could, you're going to learn a lot about yourselves. You're going to find a momentum in your life that you've been looking for.


 Happy New Year, ride the wave, and welcome to the movement.

1. It has to be a big life change. I failed at 50 days before during the summer but this time I went hard at the gym, and started getting a 4.0 in school (3.0 student). The energy, time, and motivation from nofap allows you to excel in the other aspects of your life. You will seek constant improvement and the positives associated with growth, because you are no longer mentally stagnant. Seeking real girls is much more fun than images/videos on the internet.
2. Yes it really does work. I would always think about doing things and never go for it. I'd think about a girl in my class for a whole semester and never muster up the courage to say shit, because I have none. Just a slight nervousness and then I realize it feels good EVEN if I get rejected because I tried. 
3. The motivation from stopping helped me to get a job. I also lost 3% body fat, and am able to run faster and with better endurance. 
4. There is no magic day you hit where you realize you have suddenly become the man. It is a gradual life change
5. After passing baseline and extreme horniness, and I can express myself a thousand times more easily. My family relations are better than ever and I feel more thoughtful of others (while caring less about what they think about ME. I love me, I trust me.)

I have used porn before the internet became mainstream- I used to steal adult DVDs from my friend's house and burn them onto the family computer (encrypting the files

The adrenaline rush of bringing something like ten hardcore porn DVDs into school every day to sell in the playground was almost as good as the content itself. I had my regular customers

I reckon I earned a good average of £10-15 a week from this over the course of around six months (before I got caught...)

Before I divulge into how I got caught I must first tell you what led up to that miserable event. 
I have two schools in the town I live in- a primary school and a secondary school. At the time I was in primary school
Being the naturally sexually inquisitive 13 year old (with all his friends and their friends) he decided he would ""extend"" my business to the far larger market of horny teenagers. 

It was amazing. The first week I must've sold thirty or so DVDs at £3 each. That's £90. My cousin and I worked under a 50:50 split. 
It was like exponential growth. My cousin 'employed' his friends to sell DVDs to the neighbouring town's schools and the 'market' exploded. 
I must've been earning an average of £30 a week and it was brilliant- up until the point where the computer shop I was buying from started asking questions. 

Looking back on it
The computer store's owner caught his son with one of MY porn DVDs and now I

This is where the 'cartel' began to crumble. 
Since my cousin's dad owned a computer (with a porn blocker on) he was able to go online and buy DVDs in bulk with what he didn't tell me was his dad's stolen credit card. This was fantastic; we got the DVDs cheaper than in store and in greater volumes! It was fantastic until my cousin's dad noticed the strange cash withdrawals and what made it even worse was the fact my cousin confronted his dad with about £100 to pay for the DVDs to which point my cousin was asked ""Where the hell he got that type of money from!?"".

His room was searched and about 50 porn DVDs were found in there

I received a desperate phone call from my cousin who was in tears. In the background was vicious shouting and blaming of both parents by one another. He told me ""My Dad found the DVDs and the money and they're going to call your parents"" before abruptly hanging up. I was in utter shock and I curled into a ball and started crying. I had like £400 saved from the 'DVD cartel' and other earned money in that shoebox and I knew my parents would find it

I ran downstairs and retrieved a dustbin bag and as fast as I could I slung all the DVDs in there. I then buried them in the garden under a christmas tree.

Of course my room was raided and the DVDs were never found but I was grounded for about four months and my money was confiscated and put into a secure 18+ childs saving bank account by my parents. They contacted the schools in the area and asked if anyone had been caught with 'adult' material recently and my parents were told people had been. My parents watched my disgustingly hardcore DVDs  from my cousin (which made my mother cry) and the ones confiscated by the school and they were obviously identical. My parents have never looked at me in the same way since that.

So what has made me bring all this up? I remembered that sack of DVDs I buried. The christmas tree had long been removed from the garden so I found a shovel from the garage and started digging around the tree stump. I felt like I was digging up a long murdered corpse from my past. I kept digging until *crunch*

I counted 46 DVDs in there and I found one which worked. I was shocked at how hardcore the content was and I felt deep shame knowing I pushed this type of stuff to eight year olds. 

This shame is what is making me want to quit porn entirely and therefore cut down on masturbation.

As for the money

I am just asking for some time. We both could use it. Maybe we will grow apart a bit. Maybe you will make new friends. Actually I hope that you will make new friends. Close friends. Someone who will take all you have to give. Someone who will laugh when you cry

2. **Smile at a Stranger** You will feel better and most people enjoy the fact that someone they don't know noticed them. 
3. **Look around and realize how (blessed/luck) you are**
4. **Exercise** It will keep your mind off of PMO
5. **Finish what you set out to do** This one is truly important, one of which is get PMO under control.
6. **Read the News** Be an informed individual
7. **Meditate** Enjoy the clearness of mind and soul you can achieve while participating in No Fap.
8. **Enjoy something small** These small moments are out there all the time and they can brighten your day. Plus these moments are part of the Human Experience
9. **Learn from any failure you might have** Shit happens

Now a little bit about myself. I'm in my late 20's, and beautiful women without so much as a peck on the cheek. I knew in my heart of hearts that I would never get laid, and would likely die a virgin; being acutely suicidal exacerbated this idea. When I was 20 I set out to lose my virginity.

I don't know why I chose her, back when they still advertised adult services. Her pictures made her seem much more attractive than she was. When I arrived at the seedy motel in LA l walked by a shady individual who I later imagined had seen her immediately before I did. I'm not sure of this, but it's too late to change my mind now.

She was... much shorter, but I didn't and I'll have to live with it. I lost every virginity I had to offer that night. She was the first girl I had ever kissed, my first blowjob, my first cunnilingus, my first vaginal sex in every position i could recall from every porno I had ever seen, and my first anal sex.

After growing so accustomed to what we call the death grip, and humility I felt on the drive back home that fateful summer night. What was supposed to be a pivotal, momentous, and memorable night in a man's life was just wasted away on a prostitute.

Instead of learning my lesson, petite blonde, (I was hell-bent on not making the same mistake I made with the first.) She wouldn't let me kiss her or even touch her, probably the worst experience ever.

Since that week,000-40,000.) I'm trying to stop. I deleted every account I have on every escort review website I could think of.

I would like to teach you something that is helping me immensely. I have a personal interest in NLP (neuro linguistic programming) and one of the key concepts in NLP is to focus on what you want rather than what you don't want. Because our brain can't handle the word ""Don't"" it skips it. Let me explain:

If I would type here **DON'T THINK OF A POLAR BEAR**. Don't see a polar bear in your mind. Don't imagine a polar bear walking in the snow. And for the love of god don't think of the baby polar bears that just popped up in your mind as you read that sentence. You would not be able to think of nothing else even if I encouraged you not to think about it. 

As you read what you weren't suppose to think about, when we go around thinking that we ""DON'T want to fap"" what is it that our brain is occupied with really? Yes, thoughts of fapping. This makes the process harder. 

Another example, and then perhaps I become desperate our clingy in order to sort that out. 

But if I think that ""I want to be a good boyfriend"" the thing I'm concerned with is ""good boyfriend"" and my behaviour will change according to that wish

So don't walk around thinking about how you don't want to relapse, or a better physique, or a better job, and use your mental energy on that, because being concerned with the things you DON'T want will only make you expose yourself to that anyways.

-Create yourself a golden rule that you will follow no matter what; no orgasm or something alike is probably not a good idea because you will end up edging and sooner or later this always leads to a relapse.
Something that seems to be working for me is ""I will not touch my penis for other things than basic hygiene and peeing"". This is good because it gives you a clear idea of what not to do and this is very helpful when your depleted brain tries to bargain its crack dose.

-If you do relapse

-Do yourself a favor and install a porn filter, but having to make these additional steps before being able to watch porn helps you reframe things.

-Beware of the vague definition of porn, even if there is no nudity present.

-Start doing it with a friend

-Replace your habit of masturbation with some physical activity; it will assist the healing process and help with any excess of nervous tension. I've been doing 30 minutes of yoga every day and it really helps with tension and anxiety.

-If you have other personal habits you want to change

I hope this will be helpful to all the newcomers and if you anything to add do not hesitate.

#8 — Dopamine Makes You Addicted To Seeking Information

Do you ever feel like you are addicted to email or twitter or texting? Do you find it impossible to ignore your email if you see that there are messages in your inbox? Have you ever gone to Google to look up some information and 30 minutes later you realize that you’ve been reading and linking

Enter dopamine – Neuro scientists have been studying what they call the dopamine system for a while. Dopamine was “discovered” in 1958 by Arvid Carlsson and Nils-Ake Hillarp at the National Heart Institute of Sweden. Dopamine is created in various parts of the brain and is critical in all sorts of brain functions, sleeping, mood, attention, and motivation, seeking and reward.

The myth — You may have heard that dopamine controls the “pleasure” systems of the brain: that dopamine makes you feel enjoyment, such as food, sex, and drugs.

It’s all about seeking — The latest research, desire, seek out, and search. It increases our general level of arousal and our goal-directed behavior. (From an evolutionary stand-point this is critical. The dopamine seeking system keeps us motivated to move through our world, learn, and survive). It’s not just about physical needs such as food, or sex

Wanting vs. liking – According to Kent Berridge, then we start to run in an endless loop. The latest research shows that the dopamine system is stronger than the opoid system. We seek more than we are satisfied (back to evolution… seeking is more likely to keep us alive than sitting around in a satisfied stupor).

A dopamine induced loop – With the internet, then we get rewarded for the seeking which makes us seek more. It becomes harder and harder to stop looking at email, stop texting, stop checking our cell phones to see if we have a message or a new text.

Anticipation is better than getting — Brain scan research shows that our brains show more stimulation and activity when we ANTICIPATE a reward than when we get one. Research on rats shows that if you destroy dopamine neurons, and swallow, but will starve to death even when food is right next to them. They have lost the desire to go get the food.

More, research also shows that the dopamine system doesn’t have satiety built in. It is possible for the dopamine system to keep saying “more more more”,  seeking even when we have found the information. During that google exploration we know that we have the answer to the question we originally asked, and yet we find ourselves looking for more information and more and more.

Unpredictable is the key — Dopamine is also stimulated by unpredictability. When something happens that is not exactly predictable, you may remember “variable reinforcement schedules”. Dopamine is involved in variable reinforcement schedules. This is why these are so powerful).

When you hear the “ding” that you have a text – The dopamine system is especially sensitive to “cues” that a reward is coming. If there is a small, or a visual cue, that enhances the addictive effect (for the psychologists out there: remember Pavlov).

140 characters is even more addictive – And the dopamine system is most powerfully stimulated when the information coming in is small so that it doesn’t full satisfy. A short text or twitter (can only be 140 characters!) is ideally suited to send our dopamine system raging.

Not without costs — This constant stimulation of the dopamine system can be exhausting. We are getting caught in an endless dopamine loop.

Write a comment and share whether you get caught in these dopamine loops and whether you think we should use what we know about these systems to create devices and websites that stimulate them.

And for those of you who like research:

I have to first say that this subreddit is such an excellent idea to have and such a help for those of us who want to improve in our self-control and discipline. I would advise that you use this subreddit as much as possible through your journey, and expecting a different result"". While this may or may not be true in some circumstances, when it comes to discipline and self-control we have to see what went wrong the last time we did relapse, and work on that mistake. Which brings me to why I'm writing this, I thought you all could use a few pointers that has helped me stay away from fapping:



****If you've relapsed



This is to help you keep accountable to what you're doing. Humans have a natural tendency to be irresponsible if they're not held accountable. By reporting it to someone it also helps you gain encouragement and an outside perspective when you do discuss it with people or a person. *Those who think they can handle it and do it all on their own are usually the ones who fall the hardest*, after you've done this, you want to make sure you talk about what you're going to do differently this time. Make sure you state what you've learned from that mistake so you won't repeat it again. This helps give room for a *productive and forward thinking conversation*, instead of just basking in regret of your mistake. You'll start to think like a winner, and a determined person. We're all not perfect and we all experience problems and shortcomings, but I think the real winners are the one's who accept their mistakes, identify what went wrong, build, and state a solution for that problem if you come across it again in the future.**



****Most of the battle in this journey will have to be won in your mind first****



Now this point is probably the biggest of all and has been the factor behind most of my successes in life period! You have to come to a decision about what kind of thoughts you want to think, it's totally worth it! That talk can help you in more ways than one, and is a gold mine for becoming and achieving anything you want to. This is basically done if you ""fake it, til you make it"". When you change your thoughts, your behaviour basically cannot help but become what you think. Don't feel confident? don't feel encouraged? don't feel like you'll last long? Forget all those thoughts! Fake your confidence, determination, and self-disciplin until you become it! Watch the [TED talk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks-_Mh1QhMc)

This brings me to my reason as to why you have to win the battle in your mind first is because you are driven to act like you think. This is also based in the psychological concept of [cognitive dissonance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance), your being dishonest. When you experience this, you have two options: change your thoughts or change your behavior. You can see more explanations or examples from this [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=korGK0yGIDo). In simple terms, you're trying to take away the discomfort of your conflicting thoughts and behavior by changing one of two things: your thoughts or your behavior. 

This is the major battle with masturbating, you're just deceiving yourself. And you don't wanna be a deceptive person, especially not to yourself. So conclude that the situation is bad for you period! Get that straight in your mind and don't get caught up in it, because human behavior doesn't work like that way. Decide from now on, that once a situation has pornography/nudity/your fetish/arousing conversations and thoughts, etc, it WILL lead you to relapse. If you don't take the time to figure this out, and will be compelled to change your behavior, self-control



****Change your reward system when you accomplish no fapping in a day



Here you have to change how you reward yourself, what you can do is change how you reward yourself. For example, you can go watch a movie/ eat at your favorite restaurant/ go shopping/ tell someone to hold your ps3/xbox until you've achieved a month without fapping. Whatever it is make sure the reward applies to you and your life, it has to be something that you consider valuable or a treat to yourself. You have to change the way you celebrate successes, and what you celebrate with. So you not only are controlling you're thoughts and what you say to yourself now, your also controlling what you're rewarding yourself with too. Wow, your actually REALLY taking control of your life now!

Set goals for yourself by the day, right them down right now!!! Get creative with yourself and put it in a calendar, mark off the dates, count down to the week/month/months/year. Get as involved into setting these goals for yourself as you can. Put it in your reminders. 



****Be realistic about the challenges



When your making out this plan for yourself, so when they actually experience the battlefield, they have all the set routines for situations they may face. You know why secret agents, army men, police, etc train for so long?? It's because the training is to help them come up with possible routines about possible problems they can face in their line of work. So sit down and come up with an action plan, training or ""avoidance routine"" just like them, then come up with methods or routines of how you will escape or avoid these problems.



****The first part is always the hardest



When people start any task, it almost always goes good for the first period they commit. This is totally normal, and that's why you hear a lot people going so hard at first and ready to take on the world. That's the nice part about making these changes! but sadly this part will fade with time and that's when your body will begin to say ""alright, I've been out of my comfort zone for too long, it's time to go back to my normal routine"". This is when you'll start feeling all the urges and all the mental/physical strings tugging you get back to your old habits. I want you to know that this is totally natural and you will experience it like any normal human being. It's happening because your starving your body of something, so it's gonna fight back, it's not gonna go away without a fight in you. But it's not about size of the dog in this fight, how determined are you to fight for this self-discipline and to gain your trust back? if you really want it you'll have to implement some mindhacks called ""self talk"" and you'll have to keep your mind mentally focused on your goal and nothing else. [Wikipedia has an article on self talk here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrapersonal_communication)



****It will take a while until you can trust yourself again



One thing you'll have to come to terms with is that you cannot trust yourself right now, I'm sure you don't want that, you want to live life to the fullest and not just be in this repetitive cycle of relapses. So you have to also admit that you cannot trust yourself for now because of what has happened. It's nothing bad, it's just the reality of things. Trust is one of those things that is broken easily, but takes a while to build back up again. That's because it's a very valuable thing, and anything worth having in life, is worth fighting for. So fight for it, so take time with this

One of the downfalls of accomplishment is that when we achieve something or get over a milestone we tend to get cocky and pride seeps in. **DON'T DO THIS, but focus on the next prize and keep going. That's why it's good to set many goals and not just one ultimate goal. So in short, don't get all cocky once you start going stay humble and keep setting goals. 



****Hold yourself accountable by emailing your future self****



This is not something you necessarily need to do, and self-discipline. You can email your self through this [site called futureme.org](http://www.futureme.org/) and it lets you write an email to your self but you get to set the date you'll receive the email. So you can write a letter to yourself asking yourself and encouraging yourself in your journey hoping that your journey is going good and hoping that you accomplished a lot by that date. Make yourself accountable in the email, and put expectations that you hoped to have achieved by then.


These are some of my tips that i used to success, you have it in you! If nobody believed in you in this life, I do, and I'm here along with everyone else to support you through this journey.



**TLDR; A summary of the main points:**

* Admit that masturbating/pornography/lust, and say what you'll do in order not to repeat that mistake. This creates a productive and ""forward thinking"" conversation instead of just complaining and living in regret.

* The battle you have to win is mostly in your mind. Who cares if you don't feel like how you should

* Change your reward system, months, and even for a year!

* Be realistic about the challenges you'll face and create ""avoidance routines"". All people in fields/sports/services that require discipline do it

* The first part is always the hardest

* It will take a while until you can trust yourself again, takes time to build back. 

* Hold yourself accountable by emailing your future self! This will help you reflect on the kind of person you want to become at a later date

Two weeks ago I was at 30 days and was experiencing a real high in terms of the rewards I was receiving for my No Fap.

The long and short of it is that we are now together and getting on like a house on fire.  The second night we hung out and fell into each others eyes deeply and have had some mind blowing experiences since. Our second sexual experience was virtually tantric and I had a no ejaculation

I would NEVER have been able to approach a woman of this calibre before, she knows I am going without masturbation or orgasm for a period of time and has told me she is so deeply satisfied with our connection that she doesn't mind we haven't had sex and has so much respect for me doing this. So hard mode continues and a great deal of pleasure during our lovemaking is in making her orgasm.

Hey everyone
* First off
* The main reason I wrote this post was to show how simple it can be to approach someone we're interested in, and the right attitude. We often over-think things and make them more complicated than they need to be.  
*  The goal, when approaching a woman, should be to get to know her as a person, with the hope of forging a relationship, whether it is friendly or romantic.  
* **Courage and confidence are qualities that are built.** Most people are not inherently audacious and do not ooze with confidence. Only through small daily acts and little successes can one build courage and confidence. Personally
* The Law of Attraction is definitely pseudo-science. There is no scientific proof of the validity of this thought process, and I wasn't a big fan. However, I'm currently reading Napoleon Hill's Think and Grow Rich, and I do believe our thoughts are extremely powerful. I used ""the law of attraction"" to get a point across - that being: when you show someone genuine interest, they tend to reciprocate it, or at the very least, appreciate the flattery. That's human nature. Try it out and you'll see.

Self control is a muscle in the brain. The more you exercise it in other domains

For example, I don't like to have 1 or 5. I like to have a lot. But I also wanted to become a master of myself. So I decided I would go out with a drinking group one night and be the DD. It was hard, but I did it. I had the resolve to be in control. If I can't control this, I can't control fapping. If I can't control fapping, I can't control my life.

Another example: working out. I used to work out until I was tired and then stop. But then I looked up a regiment and decided to follow through no matter what. It was fucking HARD. I had to do 3 sets more than I usually did in a variety of different exercises. But each painful rep of each painful set, I can't control fapping. If I can't control fapping, I can't control my life.

A different type of example: doing simple things better. For example, and to keep my blinker on until I'm fully done the maneuver. While cleaning, I make a conscious effort to do it up to what I imagine would be military standards. I imagine some fucking asshole yelling at me for missing a little hair on the sink after I shaved, or a piece of lint on the carpet after I vacuumed. I make my bed tight. All this carries over into good posture and dressing nicely and presenting myself a certain way to people. If I can't control these, I can't control fapping. If I can't control these, or fapping, I'm not in control of my life.

It's about self control. Fapping is just one aspect of that. Control everything else

A quote I read on reddit a while back that set the stage for this mindset was in /r/motivation or some subreddit like that: ""If you can't handle doing the dishes when you're supposed to

Do I plan to continue? I'm not sure. It'd feel weird to fap again after so long of not, then nine, now twelve.

If I do fap

1. Only fap at night/end of the day. Orgasm during the morning/day often makes you feel lethargic for the rest of the day and make you unmotivated/lazy. Fapping before bed once you've already got everything out of the way and can relax makes much more sense to me now.

2. Reduce the amount of times you fap. 2-3 times a week tops. Multiple times a day is where it gets problematic and unhealthy.

3. Restrict porn. This is a verrryyy hard one. The male brains loves nothing more than watching an absolutely gorgeous girl get fucked - I'll be the first to admit it. I've fapped before without it as we all have

4. Changing your mindset while watching porn. If you're in a relationship (like me) it can be very easy to develop negative expectations on what sex should be like or what your girlfriend/boyfriend should act or look like. Girls in porn are almost always chosen based on their looks, they get paid to have sex and get paid to look beautiful. It's not just in porn either, it's everywhere; advertising, movies, tv, the internet, reddit. Enjoy porn for what it is but never lose sight of your SO's beauty or what made you fall in love with them in the first place. Keep your head in the real world.

5. Become multi-orgasmic or learn to orgasm without ejaculation. Yes it's possible - the ancient Chinese based a lot of their sexual theory/practices by making the male focus on abstaining from ejaculation. Step 1: more kegels!

6. Never put masturbation ahead of sex. If you know you're going to get laid in a day or two

Her reaction was amazing. She giggled, I asked for her number and she said give me your number and let me decide if I want to call you, so I gave her my number and a big hug, and left.

She starts giggling

""Y-no

Today (Friday) I was on a supermarket at the same mall, young brunette with ice-blue eyes sitting behind my cashier. I load my groceries onto the conveyor belt and patiently wait for my turn. She greets me, I greet her. She scans my groceries. She tells me how much it is. 

""I'll use my card

""What?"" she asks

""Are you single?"" I repeat with the same confidence. 

""Yeah..."" she asks with a smile and a downward gaze, even twisting a little bit in her chair. 

""You wanna go on a date with me?"" I ask her. She looks at me with that same guffawing demeanor.

""Listen

""I'm afraid I'm not."" I smile back at her. - ""Sorry

""I felt I had to simply ask you

Then we switched over to a completely normal conversation with her being very helpful and I being completely cool and casual. I don't think the smile disappears from her face at all. She wishes me a good work-out

finish the 90 day challenge. Tomorrow?  I'm not 
sure,215,27,109,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/136hw2/two_days_ago_i_spoke_before_400_people_today_i/,"Hello everybody :)
 

Exactly 91 days ago, but hopeful as well. My habits could change, **I could change!** And so i started off the day after. It hasn't been easy, with new temptations nearly every day, but i persisted. I couldn't and wouldn't let this part of me, that i wanted to say goodbye forever, get the best of me.
 

And so, but i'll try to tell you as much as possible.


**Day 1-3:** Hard as hell (no pun intended, but i wouldn't let myself go, for i had a purpose, something to achieve, and i couldn't just give up after only a few days due to my pride and even a touch of vanity. Nobody would like to realize the position he is in after giving in to an addiction, so i went on.


**Day 4-15:** I felt increasing confidence as i went on and started to get used to the temptations everywhere. I'm not saying i wasn't tempted, so when a friend flaked on me for 2 days of a 4 day festival, i decided to just go anyways and have fun. I had a blast and was more convinced than ever that this was the way to go.


**Day 16-30:** my confidence kept building up and around the 25 day mark, i wouldn't ditch my values or stop being a good student. However, i would become more outgoing, less boring and generally a bigger value to peoples lives. As i started off the year with this attitude, i noticed how i had switched sides and now belonged to the part of society that had fun, even during regular days. Other people, being as i was before, again, etc. I also figured out that cold showers would give me energy and determination for the rest of the day. Daily pushups boosted my confidence as well.


**Day 31-40:** I went for it, and it got the better of me when she started gossiping about me and generally ruining people's opinion about me. I still see this period as the reason i'm still single today, as before i could fix the damage she had done, it was already to late with the girl i had been talking to a lot before... Anyways, i talked a lot with my friends and decided just to let her live her rotten life. She had turned against me when i broke up with her, even if i was perfectly gentle (like, for real) and she had treated me badly for weeks (well, ignoring me and not having time for me whenever she wanted). I did however did discover the flourishing gossips that had turned into existence because of how she had behaved, favoring me and rendering a lot of those gossips harmless. So after this little crisis, and so i moved on...


**Day 41-65:** Difficult time: while i was much improved over my previous self, decided every time not to give in or even edge, and except one wet dream, which became lucid right when it was too late and gave me a horrible feeling afterwards, i stayed clean. I also had some awesome days, of course, but there were too many ups and downs for me to truly be able to say that it was a very enjoyable time.


**Day 65-85:** Getting it together again. Trouble was behind me, being full of work for school, but the few times i got together with people were absolutely fantastic and saved my mood more than once when i was studying. I kept building myself up part by part, becoming more of the person i wanted to be every single time. I also signed up for a presentation during the project, as the only volunteer of our group.


**Day 86-87:** I was flying high once more. My confidence was as high as it had been before, but i tackled it with great determination and managed to finish it all before it was time to leave for our international meeting.


**Day 88-90:** After a long trip, we gathered with the other participating groups of the event, and i did something i couldn't have before i took the challenge: i did a presentation in front of hundreds of people, without anyone doing it before me to ease my nerves. I stressed until right before the time, but i nailed it. I freaking did it and i'm proud to say it. Video's, pictures and reactions showed me that i had done as well as i could barely imagine and i felt something. That incredible feeling when you have pushed your boundaries so far that it could've left you shivering in misery, but instead raised you higher than ever. That feeling when you have conquered a fear, and you KNOW that you will never be the same again. I got that feeling

The rest of the day was a fantastic time: my remarks changed the debates drastically, so they could) and managed to be a value to peoples days (as i had always wanted, and not done on such a scale before). I believe this day changed me fundamentally, but wouldn't have been possible before this challenge, and today, on day ninety, i speak to you as a proud man (well, but i'll take my chance)


So to those who still doubt the challenge: Fucking take it already! It's not a miracle road to greatness, but this, right here, is solid gold and it's there just for you, so let go of fapping and take it with both hands, never to let go of it ever again. You might not make it the first try, but it doesn't matter. This challenge is not about the end point, and the harder it is


Peace out

I have been a long lurker and in serious denial of my problem with PMO. Tomorrow is my birthday, and would then utterly destroy any chance I may have had with the woman I was talking to. The cycle would start over, and continued for the next 18 years. I am a nice guy (I get friend zoned a lot) and have been told this many times. Yet every time my relationships failed and I would end up single again, I would just blame the women, never me. 

I recently met a girl that I am nuts about. We have a ton in common and more similar interests that anyone I have known over the past 18 years, picking up on subtle clues while talking and the like are coming back. I now see that fapping is the issue and my addiction to PMO is to blame. 

I want things to work with this girl more than anything. So yesterday I completely gave up everything I had with that part of my life. I destroyed several hard drives (about 2 TB worth) of pictures and videos. I thew out several (yes I had a few) ""female analogs"" I had. I also stopped drinking!

What was sold to us is a house in the country with lots of space and fresh air, grifters, filthy streets, smog, traffic, violence, inequality.  A place where we could work on the old Mustang and let our dog and our kids run free in the yard.  A retirement that would provide for us as in old age so long as we'd been faithfully saving.

Instead, and we lost our shirts when the markets saw suburbia for what it is, an imitation of something real.

What we forgot was that everything worth having is the result of hard work.

In the same way, aren't they all?) who might blow you off on a whim or who might have a boyfriend who is bigger than you.  A girl who might, for what ever reason, break your heart.  A girl who if she is worth anything will make you wait a goddamned second or two because she knows it will be better for the waiting.

Instead, and at the same time less meaningful and less thrilling than just a word whispered into our ear, from the lips of a good woman.  Still, we bought it and we got off.  And after a while things started happening.  Suddenly, it wasn't as good or it wasn't enough.  And we used more.  Before we knew it we were letting our wives or girlfriends writhe in the bed next to us because of PE or ED or because we were gaming or watching TV to distract us from what was happening.  We let them forget what real intimacy felt like and, in turn, we began to forget ourselves.  Our work suffered, our minds suffered. We began to throw around blame.  At last

Again

The good news is that others still remember.  And in the dark recesses inside us -- the place where we often fear to look in for what we might find -- so do we.  We know that the feeling of collapsing in exhaustion at the end of a workout is more satisfying than any drug.  We know what it feels like to really go after it at work and reap the rewards of a job well done.  We know that investing in our educations is more valuable than any car we might drive.  We know that charity and sustainability can make us richer than any material excess.  We know that a good book is far better than television.  We know that porn will never mean as much as looking others unflinchingly in the eye.

And even the most porn-addicted among us knows or at least hopes to whatever god may be that when he dies he will take with him the memory of satisfying a woman

I just wanted to tell you guys how happy I am I started NoFap. I'm ony on day 5, joking around with the bouncers, talking to many many lovely ladies! The party ended at 3, (which is a bit early for me personally), but I hung out with two lovely ladies 'til the early hours. of course the alcohol helped, but I think NoFap has a lot to do with the way I was behaving.

I feel more confident and manly when I walk the streets or go to the supermarket. Normally at the supermarket I would often get very nervous at the check out

It's a real eye opener to experience that it is truely all about confidence. I had to fight some cravings in the past 4 days

I'm not trying to sound cocky
that when I share this kind of stuff

I'm very curious what the future holds for me!

I had to watch this guy do what I thought wasn't an amazing job of showing her a good time for the evening, but I didn't even mind.  I thought to myself that there would be a good book (a little Arthur C. Clarke, if you're into that) waiting for me at the end of the night regardless.

Apparently this sort of behavior turns you into a complete stud, this other hot girl starts all dancing up on me, and long-story-short I dance with her for the better part of the night, with make-out sessions completely initiated by her (my first ever, really).  Strangest thing.  A 5 mile run and a cold shower at 4 in the morning is all I could have done to keep this streak going.

Anyway, I have never done it before. I saw a stunning blonde girl walking on her own in central park. Everything in my head was telling me to walk away but another part of me knew I had to at least try. I approached her, everything started great and we walked around the park together.Turns out shes Russian and here for one day so I take her to the nicer parts of Manhatten. Anyway, we end up kissing, having a great day etc.. 

I probably wont see her again but the fact that I did it still astounds me.  I believe Nofap might give you that push to do things you won't normally do. I have no option now but to talk to girls if I want any kind of release. going home and fapping is not an option.

I was done. If I smoked then I was tempted to overeat and play games

My mind was fucked up from the cycle. I was out of touch of reality. I no longer had any hope or faith in anything in my life. All I wanted was pleasure. I was lonely. Isolated. Angry. Sad. Only time I was happy was when I was caving in

At first it wasn't too bad. I hit the gym every other day, but I wanted to use it as a practice hoping the discipline would translate to other areas of my life. Also wanted more mental clarity, and less bitch-ass-ness that comes from low testosterone and low sex drive.

I didn't focus on meditating or reading books and shit like I did before. I didn't go to marijuana anonymous meetings because all they talk about is how great the meetings are but never really get into any real juicy issues. Wanted to just spend the first 2 or 3 weeks detoxing before getting into rebuilding my mind.

Things were getting better. Covered shifts at work. Got an internship. Started dropping fat from diet and exercise. Then I met a girl. We had a lot of wild sex. Too much. She was a negative girl and it rubbed off on me. My mind was vulnerable without its usual fillers and was sensitive to any new incoming information.


I noticed even after we had sex

When I went home my mind was still looking for a chaser, so I bounced and now I've been sleeping in my car the last 2 nights.

Halloween weekend, handsome, smart, passionate, yet somehow I managed to spend every holiday alone this year. It really got me down. I was skating down venice beach just wishing someone would bump into me so I could beat the shit out of them. I tried meditating but just ended up cursing at God and knocking down signs and trashcans. 

Grew up an only child with no family, others say I'm an asshole, but it's hard for me to be in between. PEople love going to parties with me but never stick around on regular days when I just want a friend to hang out with. 

I know the weed made it worse. It was clouding my dreams, inferiority complexes. Started having more and more violent fantasies.


Sober on my 18th day ( I smoke once but fuck it ill say 17th, so for the last 4 nights I've been without a home or any kind of communication with people besides email.

Suicidal thoughts are reigning my mind tonight. If things don't get better in a year from now I'm killing myself. Whatever it is that people need in order to live happily, I'd rather be out causing mayhem than spending another thanksgiving or new years crying in my room.

Until then I guess it's time to get into some recovery. Get a sponsor for my weed problem. Try to understand what my mind is going through without having porn or gaming to escape into. Try to accept the lost years of my life, and without them, I don't know what to do with my life. I'm scared, and I'm lazy.

I really just want to feel good. Just close my eyes a disappear from the world. I don't have much hope for anything. Maybe my bipolar has me swinging really low again. I'm tired of the mood extremes.  Going to yoga tomorrow morning, nothing more than hookups if I can even get that. 

Just going through a really hard time with all this right now, and seeing the white girl who only worked at my job 3 months get promoted where I've been working 1.5+ years. My mind is looking for victims, an outlet, I don't know. I hate everything and everyone right now. I just hope all of this is worth it, and that I find a better way to live, and have love and success in my life.",,,,

A couple months ago, her roommate and his mom shows up. We all hang out and play board games. Now her roommate’s mom is really hot, (and since I was 21 days nofap) I decide to playfully flirt with the mom. The mom is totally into it. It gets late though, and she eventually leaves. It's only me, my date and her roommate left. I suppose her roommate didn't enjoyed me flirting with his mom because I was cock-blocked the rest of the night. 
    

At about 12:30am, they set me up in the ""Guest Loft"" which is an alcove/cubby about 6 feet off the ground right next to this girls room. I'm so exhausted that I just crash instead of waiting up for her to finish brushing her teeth (I should have waited). I’m asleep in this guest loft, right next to this girl's room and I start having crazy sexual dreams. One of the dreams is so intensely sexual that I wake up right away realizing something bad. I look down and see that I justed blasted about 21 days worth of jizz into my underwear (wet dream).
    

I think “holy fuck this is bad - You can't get invited to a girls house and then jizz all over her guest room bed.” I'm freaking out, i totally forgot that I’m in a loft. I end up diving head first down a 6 foot drop.
    

At the last moment, I just jizzed all over the place broke her cabinet and the wall, everyone must have heard it! So i run to the bathroom in my sticky underwear while carrying my jeans. Finally some good luck. It’s looks as if all the jizz stayed in my underwear. But now I have to figure out what to do with a destroyed pair of underwear. Do I try to hide it somewhere? Where? They must have heard the crash. They are probably right outside looking to see what happened. I quickly ball up the underwear and shove it down my pants. I go back to the bed and no one is there?!. I look around for jizz evidence. I can't find any, but its dark (i'm like 90% sure that it all stayed in my underwear!) Now my only concern is the smell. I mean, c'mon it's 21 days’ worth of cum. And, she's sleeping, at most
    

Anyways, it's not like it was a coworker and I would be permanent known as the creep who masturbates all over your guest room while you sleep). So I laydown and fall back asleep. I wake up to sounds of the girl moving around the house. She goes downstairs, so I have quickly make the bed while looking for any cum stains (I didn't see any!). I put all my clothes on while she comes back up the stairs. She jokes about how I'm trying to break her house into pieces. All of a sudden, in slowmotion, i see her nostrils flair. She is starting to smell the jizz! I quickly make some excuse about having to grab some mouthwash from my car. I run out to the and secretly pull the underwear out of my pants and stash it. Now, I made it thus far. I decide to push my luck,  I come back into the house and we hang out for like 2 hours

I spent all the next day waiting for a text message: ""Did you cum all over the guest loft?""

Anyway

While dating her I still watched plenty of porn and masturbated probably 3-5 times a week which isn't that much compared to some, then 30 days, and so on, I was much easier to get aroused and was much more interested in doing physical activity and such. Since starting, I've been lifting weights regularly and been participating in sports through my school. It was kind of just replacing one thing with a healthier thing and I haven't looked back since.

21 year old

This is easily my strongest run on NoFap so far. I stumbled upon this community in January of 2012, no-fappin. In those 50 days, I added 5 lbs. of muscle (onto my sparse 120 frame), carved out my six-pack, and emerged from my self-made prison of introversion. The first two weeks felt like I was *living* for the first time, noticing things like a beautiful sunrise and discovering the ambition to pull off monstrous deadlines with the fluid ease of a trapeze artist. With a six-pack. 

I made a decision to go back to porn in mid-March of 2012 - not under the impression that I was “cured,” was sweeping this subreddit - a mentality that I have a huge problem with, and one that was populated by self-entitled children. So I took the easy way out. Instead of standing up for my beliefs (on the internet liek a reel man), I quit coming to NoFap. Without the safety net of this site, it was a matter of weeks before I relapsed at day 50 in 2012.

This prompted several months of PMO *immersion* - this time with the added fact that I knew I was better than the activity I was engaging in. **Far better.** I built up small streaks after this long period of self-flagellating

Until December 23rd

*That’s when I quit bitching to myself that NoFap is hard

I must say, still exercising, eating better than ever, and having the stones to make some real social connections and improvements. I won’t lie to y’all chillins. It’s been *tough.* Every day past 90 that I venture towards, I find myself having to suppress enormous urges that grow daily.

Last night was no exception to this recent trend. I went to sleep ridiculously hard, maybe this isn’t the right place for that much detail. I’m quite familiar with NoFap’s rules about jizzin’ while unconscious, but goddamn. I can understand why a confused Fapstronaut or two would like to know if something that drains you so completely could warrant a reset.

I kinda felt like garbage as I loaded my sheets into the washer today. But I refuse to let this habit define who I am and who I will become. I chewed through the leash of PMO with my own goddamn teeth months ago, then NoFap is a fucking *lifestyle* y’all, not some magic fucking bullet you shoot at your dick in the hopes of it suddenly attracting the poonanies. Improve yourself first, son. Go hard or go home.

Practicing self-control brings you more pleasure than masturbating will ever give you. This much I can say with confidence.

But not all is lost.  I still learned a great deal about myself and have made a huge improvement from how I used to be.  I threw out the toy and reset my counter.  My personal goal for this challenge was not to gain as many days as possible per se, and even just affectionate gestures in general.  In general I am past the point of actually being interested in looking at porn.  Even though I looked at a couple of different models that I used to, the hardcore stuff I used to watch does not appeal to me in any way.

Hello all. This is my very first time posting anything on reddit. I will try my best keep it short and sweet for you guys.

I am a 25 year old female. I am on day 21 without PM and day 10 without O. 

I discovered porn and masturbation at age 18. I was not sexually active during high school. I was very overweight and had no self-esteem. It wasn’t until college that I started to explore. I masturbated a lot through-out the 4 years I spent at school. I even gain more weight. I had one sexual encounter but being a virgin I chickened out. 

College ended and I tried to continue living on my own with my college friends as roommates. I had a thing for one of my best guy friend (who was also my roommate) who only had eyes for my best friend. I was hurt when he asked me to set them up but I did it (they’re getting married soon.) I guess I suddenly became a threat because they started hating me and eventually I had to leave my own place and move back home.

I was so depressed by the whole thing. Here I was, reliant on alcohol and video games for fun, extremely low self esteem and to top it all off I was living with my parents. I’ll skip over the small details but it took 2 years of hard work on myself to get to where I am now. 

So far I have lost 80lbs, participate in a martial art, run daily and go out dancing. Yeah that’s right. I fucking dance. 

However I was still PMO’ing. My discovery of PMO was simultaneous. Since then I had always found it much easier to O to Porn than to use my imagination. It just took too long to use my imagination. And as with everyone with an addiction to porn it started off with the soft core stuff and worked its way to the more extreme. I’m no different in that aspect.

I was a 3 or 4 times a week kind of girl but I still felt like that was too much. I also would have the same ""what the fuck am I watching"" moment after each O and would feel somewhat disgusted with myself. I would feel even worse if it wasn't a good O. I would immediately think

My job required me to work nights so I was using PMO less for pleasure and more as a way to get to sleep during the day. Looking back I really forced the O way too much. 

I decided that it was time to try out dating. I did a reflection of myself and saw that I was a perfectly normal girl in her 20’s. I was secure about my body and myself. I could handle tough situations calmly without getting stressed out. I was fun and energetic and enjoyed new things. I like to think I wasn’t bad looking now that I had shucked an extra person off my being.

I started dating someone and we lost our virginities together. The sex was great for the first few weeks. Hey

We struggled with sex off and on and I was spending a lot of time focusing on his pleasure and not getting too much in return. It never bothered me too much because I could just take care of myself with porn. (He also admitted to watching porn. It didn’t bother me at all)

I noticed that I was starting to gain some weight back. I was suddenly binge eating again. I had stopped running. I wasn’t happy but I wasn’t sad either. The relationship was comfortable but not intoxicating. He was falling in love and I just felt “meh” about the whole thing.

One day I was trying to find a solution to his orgasm problem and stumbled upon No Fap Challenge and YourBrainOnPorn. I must have spent the next 3 hours reading forums and stories about this. I had an AH-HA moment and realized that our problem was that we were too used to our own hands and were desensitized from the porn.

We challenged each other to this no fap challenge but continued to have sex. The sex was better but he still couldn’t reach O without his own hand. Me on the other hand

I tried several times to talk about it but just got ignored. I would hold back on sex but then he would never initiate it. I would give him extra attention hoping he would feel guilty enough to reciprocate. Never worked. I became very frustrated and all I got in return was a sheepish apology and no action toward fixing it.

I started to see my partner with new eyes. He had suddenly become a lazy

I was starting to get very aggressive in bed but he would always try to calm me down with some cuddling. I didn’t want to fucking cuddle anymore. I had spent the last 4 months cuddling. I wanted out.

And this is where I have to thank you guys. Without sticking with the NoFap challenge I would have never had the metaphorical balls to stand up for what I wanted and deserved in that relationship. I could have easily stayed in that relationship and kept schlicking away the resentment I had toward my partner. I owe this forum a lot. 

I’m on day 21 now and over those 21 days I have experienced just about everything everyone else has been experiencing. Except for the raging boners of course. Ha. I’ve experienced unbelievable urges, more ambition, slight depression, unexplainable feelings of warmth and happiness. I’m starting to lose weight again and I’ve gotten back into running. I have all this free time now and the desire to fill it with awesome things. I feel amazing right now. I have been keeping a journal of my nofap journey and I plan to stick with it.

Thank you guys for keeping this forum so active. Your posts have kept me going strong. I felt I owed you my story and hopefully this helps some other woman out there who is lurking among the sea of men in this forum

Thanks again.

- Determination and productivity. Things are getting done that have taken me ages to tackle (years in some cases).

- Better appearance and physically stronger. Many comments on how good I look (especially my skin). Lost weight and take diet and exercise seriously.

- Emotions returning to life. This can be painful and sometimes they are out of proportion but I feel alive. Someone on this subreddit wrote success is partly about living with discomfort - I'm beginning understand that. The alternative is to deaden an emotion (or never to realise you even have an emotion) with a five hour wankfest?

- Feel better about myself and my life. My mum said yesterday that she thought I seemed happier than I had in a long time. I normally tell her most things but this one will remain my little secret.

- Enjoy feeling horny. If I see / meet someone I like I don't immediately feel desperate, enjoy flirting with them in a relaxed, inventive way. People like that and respond. Even walking down the street is an erotic adventure at the moment.

I think I made fun of her or something. Usually I'll go into interview mode and ask questions like 'so where you from'

...'so when am I gonna man up and stop being a pussy'

But this time, just in a flirty way. Busting her balls, and then balancing it out with 'where you from' questions. I felt more in touch with my masculine side. I felt comfortable doing what I wanted.

I realized that

She took me back to her car, but I didn't go with her cause it was still early. Two seconds later, a woman approaches me and goes..

""Can I take you home with my friend and tie you up?""

My friends were like :O. Let me mention although I do workout and am a good looking dude, thus making her come over to me.

I immediately was like ""fuck yes you can

I chilled with her and her friend for a bit, and her extremely socially awkward brother standing in the doorway. I don't think I had sex, but whatever. Fun times.

I left that morning before they woke up. Walking around a different town not knowing where the hell I went, had some laughs about the night then went home for father's day.

I then fapped later that night. I didn't / don't feel disgusted

**PRE-FAP**

* Felt energized / alert.

* Much nicer to my family (this was a huge one).

* No longer a grump.

* WAY more social / talkative.

* Felt comfortable cracking jokes and not giving a fuck.

* Went to the gym 5 days a week (still do).

* Some stints of frustration (due to not cumming).

* Adopted a ""I'm not attached to women"" mindset. This one is huge. 

* Ambitious. Getting shit done becomes my primal nature. Procrastination took a seat.

* I got a JOB. lol.

* Dick was way more sensitive / hard. I had sex with two women during this 13 day NoFap stint and my dick wouldn't go down after I came.

* I started approaching women again

* Started recording music again.

**POST-FAP**

* Groggy. Brain fog. I'm still feeling the effects after two days.

* Bored.

* Less social. 

* I keep to myself. I don't initiate conversations. When I do

* Some social anxiety returned with women.

* Noticed I put women on a pedastle (sp?) more so then not.

* Negative attitude / voices in my head have come back a little bit.

Anyway, tackling all aspects of it. I had this unexplainable drive that motivated me to get.shit.done. I no longer had to look up motivation quotes or pictures.. I just 'was' motivated.

I have mastrubating at least 1 time a day for 6/7 years. Next month I will be 20 years old.
We all heard in our sexual education classes that mastrubation is perfectly healty. So I have been fapping almost everyday (sometimes binging) for a LONG time without knowing about any consequences it could have on my body.
Over-mastrubation is bad for you on two levels: **mind** (dopamine addiction) and **body** (nutrients you lose through your sperm). I want to talk about the effects on the body.


Everytime you ejaculate you lose SPERM. Sperm is full of minerals,7055 mg zinc each load.
Source:  http://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/content/2/6/475.short 
So with a mastrubation addiction it's easy to get a zinc deficiency


* **ZINC**

Zinc is used for a lot of important things in the body like immune system, taste and smell, hair, nails and skin (probably forgot a few).
**Zinc deficiency** can cause: 

Diarrhea

Low energy

Chronic fatigue

Infertility

stunted growth

Poor immunity

Bad memory

Inability to focus

ADD symptoms

slow wound healing

Irritability

Nerve dysfunction

Oily skin

Dandruff




A zinc deficiency can actually cause copper toxicity
So when ejaculating everyday you can easily get a zinc deficiency
I personally had the following symptoms: can't concentrate anymore, hairloss, dandruff and fatigued.
After 15 days since I started NoFap I can already focus better,
acne almost gone but still experiencing hairloss. (I have been taking 15mg of zinc from day 1)


* **COPPER**

Your body uses copper for healthy red blood cells
As zinc

**Symptoms associated with copper toxicity:**

Tired body and an overactive mind

Anxiety

Acne

Hairloss

Migraine headaches

Cravings for high-copper foods such as chocolate or nuts

Depression and fatigue

Frequent colds

Easy or frequent bruising

Mood swings

Tooth decay

Vitamin deficiencies




Symptoms I had: mood swings, fatigue and depression. Almost nobody in my family is bald, even my grandfather still has a head full of hair. Everytime I tough or wash my hair I can see hairs on my hand. My haircolour is brown/red, but the hairs that fall out are BLACK. Never understood it untill I read copper is responsible for your hair pigmentation.



So almost my entire teens I have been walking around with white spots on my nails, means a zinc deficiency and most likely a copper toxicity. I have been worrying a lot lately because a lot of my problems can be related to this: hair loss, acne (all my friends haven't gotten acne for years and my diet and hygiene is almost perfect), growth retardation (my brother is 5 years younger than me and he is way taller than me, could also be genetics but still), concentration problems, depression.


I would love to hear **your opinion** on this and if you have the same symptons. **Also** before taking any supplements you should consult a doctor

This girl (hopefully my girlfriend soon) is a serious Christian, but, as horny as this challenge sometimes makes me, I'm now more interested in the companionship aspect of a relationship. I suspect this is because I am seeing women more as people and less as attractive walking bodies.

Porn really does distort priorities, ready to control me again if I slip.

I started nofap with the goal of recovering from porn addiction.  I'd been struggling to quit porn on and off for at least a year and a half

I stopped fapping for a few different reasons...mainly I was seeking the ""reset.""   I'd been watching porn for so long that it had completely taken over my sexuality.  Without it I was essentially asexual.  I wanted to deprive myself of orgasm to allow for a ""reboot""...I wanted to build up a new sense of sexuality

It worked!  My attraction to real women has magnified to levels it never had reached before nofap.  I appreciate the beauty of, when I think about or yearn for sexual release now, it's real women I'm thinking about, not sitting on a computer and staring at the screen.  

ED-wise

Within the last week I started to feel like I had reached my goal of liberating myself from dependence on porn

Stick with it folks.  It really does make a huge difference to liberate yourself from porn addiction.  The urges are the most difficult part because they are so powerful...I still get them sometimes.   With practice you develop your own strategies for recognizing and ignoring those urges, you recognize it as nothing but the addicted part of your brain hoping for another fix, and ignore it.  And every time that happens, the urges weaken, and more importantly their power over your mind weakens.

As with others

The most important lesson I'll take away from this is the same lesson I took away at day 90.  If you see negative patterns in your life; things that are contributing to anxiety or insecurity, you have the power to change them.  With determination, and support from others, and positivity (motivate yourself by positivity, it works much better than negativity), you can change what needs to be changed to live a richer life.",,,,

**PAST:**

Like many here, I began to discover pornography through dial-up Internet on the computer in my room. Growing up in a Christian home, I always *knew* these things were wrong, even though my parents hadn't given me ""the talk"" yet. Eventually, I was caught, so Internet filters and restricted computer access curbed my addiction… for awhile. With the passage of time and the absence of discussion about sex, my parents operated under the impression that the problem had been cured. Filters went down

Thus began over a decade of addiction to pornography and masturbation. This became my dark and secret identity, both of whom were unsatisfied with life.

I tried multiple times to quit my addiction, but none were sufficient.

This community, 2012, Internet browsing lead me to the NoFap September challenge, which I promptly joined. I somehow succeeded, ultimately reaching a 43-day streak before a careless relapse sent me into a series of weekly PMO sessions for about a month and a half. Finally, enough was enough; I undertook the NoFap 90-Day Challenge with renewed vigor, allowing me to stay clean through finals, 1-month clean by Christmas

---

**PRESENT:**

This is the section most of you will be interested in: what's changed and what benefits I've gained thanks to 90 days of NoFap. I'll present it as a list.

* **Pride**. I know my life is on the right path
* **Humility**. At the same time
* **Emotions**. From unexplainable happiness to crippling sorrow
* **Perseverance**. Even now
* **Joy**. I'm now able to make eye contact with strangers and genuinely smile. Such a simple thing
* **Friendship**. My closest friends have become even closer. After opening up to them about my battle with porn addiction
* **Faith**. My spiritual life
* **Hope**. No matter how difficult things appear at the moment
* **Love**. Although I have yet to meet her, studying to complete my college education: I do all these things out of love for my future wife.

Other than those intangible yet very real changes, I've gained exactly what I sought through NoFap. My life is truly better, and it continues to gradually improve.

---

**FUTURE:**

So, they are for my wife; so I will gladly exercise self-control over my urges.

In the immediate future

On that note, because every time I've relapsed or come close to it was because I isolated myself from community for too long. Active participation in /r/NoFap and other communities helping men (and women!) gain freedom from the chains of pornography and masturbation is a *must* for my own continued progress and unshakable resolve.

My full ""reboot"" is not yet completed. I look forward to making additional reports at 120 days of NoFap, and 1 year of a new life.

---

**Summary (TL;DR):**

**My life is forever changed.** I cannot say with certainty that I won't relapse ever again, go back to the way things were. The dull life of complacency is gone for good and has been replaced with passion in the present and hope for a future filled with joy.

Learned about fapping early in high school, almost all of the time. I had absolutely no confidence. It got to the point where couldn't even look a girl in the eyes for more than a few seconds. I was absolutely miserable.


The summer after my junior year


I spent most of my senior year of high school


Eventually, I still recognized fapping as something I didn't want to keep doing forever. At that point, I didn't care if it was a sin or not, I just wanted to drop the habit.


This was around the time that I learned about /r/NoFap. I had heard of people doing NoFap months from when I went on 4chan a lot. Never took it seriously, since the quality of speeches I had to give for a class went from terrible to awesome, then back down again. The first month or so was the hardest. It felt natural to fap. Got past it through meditation and prayer. I thought that if I got to Day 90, I could start fapping once a week. When I did get there, that attitude changed. I just didn't want to fap anymore. I grew apathetic towards it. Sure, I blue-balled a lot, but I saw it as a victory. Every blue-ball was a sign that I was taking back control of my life.

--------------------------


Please note that I've found NoFap to be an incredibly positive change in my life and I haven't found any real negative effect for giving it up

I hope this post is helpful to whoever takes the time to read it.

---------------------------
Porn Usage Prior to NoFap

I discovered fapping by seeing porn for the first time when I was 12. Just some images, I fapped pretty normally, sometimes with softcore images, sometimes not. Eventually I found softcore fap material in magazines to be my primary fap-material at about 13. From there it went to animated/video-game girls (I know...) which naturally progressed into ecchi/hentai at about 15/16, when I found image-boards, alternating with softcore pictures on the internet. No videos at this stage. 

I eventually got into pretty healthy masturbation habits (once or twice a day) with ecchi/hentai/softcore pics mixed in here and there.
Eventually escalated into videos of regular porn on tube sites between 18-20, and porn/fap and gaming went hand-in-hand. Gave up gaming for 2010, and porn naturally fell away, also. Incidentally, it felt awesome for 5 months. Still fapping, not so regularly during that time. Got back into gaming, and back into porn again for another 5 months. Gave it up for 2011, but had some kind of feeling that giving up fapping made me feel better

Then I found yourbrainonporn.com in May this year. All of a sudden it all made sense. Before this, or the 7-day cycle, or any kind of NoFap information, I felt the benefits people reported (approached by women, felt focused, motivated, energetic, right?

Anyways
Started my 90-day reboot on August 1st 2011.

---------------------------
Dealing with Urges

There's no quick fix for this one. You just have to push through it. I got out of the house as much as possible, but it was mainly will power that pushed me through.

---------------------------
Withdrawal Symptoms

As I said
Suicidal depression

Flu-like symptoms

Crying

Fluctuating Emotions

Extreme self-doubt

Tiredness

Mild Insomnia

Complete lack of confidence

No desire to socialize

Very little desire to pursue women

Time-frame for withdrawals was roughly between days 1-3

They were hell guys. Be prepared. Just push through them. Don't rationalize that it's better to just fap to avoid them or clear them

-----------------
Energy

First benefits I noticed were my energy and motivation levels as well as my productivity. All of a sudden

I started filling in my spare time with productive things. Eventually I had to start taking up new hobbies (yoga, meditation, Emotional Freedom Technique (youtube it) and just general chores, cleaning etc. I still have a way to go, but I was surprised how much I wanted to get things done after the withdrawals cleared.

Waking up in the morning was no sweat. I beat my alarm on most mornings now. Some times it's a perfect 8 hours of sleep

I have been motivated as hell to get my life on track and beyond. All of a sudden, short-term, and long-term memory is improved, heh)

I finally understand what it feels like to be a man who has a hunger for achievement. There really is no way to explain the feeling except that it's a primal desire

Achieving goals

-------------------
Confidence and Self-Esteem

Bam. This one will hit you out of the blue. Just after my withdrawals, networking with powerful businessmen or making friends like a socialite, but I definitely felt like the man, and I still do.

There were ups and downs, being confident, self-assured, and feeling like a high-self-esteem person has been my default state for a while now. This has definitely shown itself through my posture, eye-contact and general way of being. My voice still needs some work, but I have generally been projecting it louder and clearer than usual.

The feeling is what counts for me though. You'll know it when you get it.

---------------------------
Mindset

This was a big one. My whole mindset and perception of the world changed during NoFap. I understood what I was missing out on in my teens. My thinking used to be along the lines of having to deal with problems and every day was another hassle to get through. With NoFap

My outlook on life has become more positive

My focus has been off-the-charts awesome. My attention span has increased, events, dates, important information, conversations, instructions and memories has been a lot more easier.

I'm less ""in-my-head"" in most situations and that voice in my head is a lot quieter. The mental benefits of NoFap are akin to meditation's benefits. People who practise meditation and/or yoga etc. will be able to relate.

-------------------
Social Skills

This was an eye-opener. I started having these uncanny conversational skills about a month into No Fap. All of a sudden, especially women. People have commented on me being a good conversationalist.

I have a natural and healthy interest in people now, more fun, and smooth. In my fapping days, I'd have to do a lot of thinking, and be in my head to think of good topics, jokes, or questions. Now it just flows

Being able to sit with a bunch of friends isn't awkward anymore. It's relaxed and fun and I feel comfortable around people. For the first time in my life

I've had friends invite me out, of both sexes, as of late. It's no coincidence that I just happened to be NoFapping for a month before this started happening. As ridiculous as it sounds to new guys, I'm convinced no fap improves your social skills.

I chanced upon nofap in a forum I frequent. It has without a doubt **improved my life**.

My story:

I have PMO'd for about 7 years. I am a 22 YO male and have suffered from ED, socially awkward, terrible with girls. It even came to rejecting girls through fear of ED.

Upon discovering nofap and the TED X Video I realised and **admitted** to myself I had a problem. After escalating extremities of porn

Nofap:

The first week was actually quite easy. I had momentum and my best friend was participating with me. I simply would not PMO. The habit was the hardest thing. I wanked before showers, also cold showers in the morning had a positive effect for the day.

At one month I had my first flat line. It lasted a week. I felt asexual

My second flat line hit about 6 weeks and again at 2 months


I met my now girlfriend during nofap (and have wrote about it here http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/t9rfp/day_17_report_that_was_pretty_amazing/) 

From 6-8 weeks onwards things became pretty automatic. I simply refused to let myself fap or look at any porn


The benefits:

My main goal was to eliminate ED. I feel cured I have the best sex I have ever had in my whole life. Me and my GF connect and spark on each other like no other partner I've had. The sex is simply amazing

I am so much more confident. I look other males in the eye

I go to the gym 3 times a week and take my protein shakes. This has always been something I have been saying I would do

Nofap has made me evaluate my life

I am positive about life and see possibilities and a future. I yearn to take on new projects and better myself.

I have strong erections (and do keggels). I also get hard simply through kissing. It has been referred to as the bonor hormone somewhere on this reddit and its accurate. When I kiss my partner I get aroused. I haven't looked at porn intentionality

I have became a sexual beast. I am nearly always horny

Nofap has improved my life drastically. I am so so grateful I found this site. I thank you

When I fapped, but for me it functions as a placebo. Ever since I fapped, I've been feeling less worthwhile and less masculine. When I do nofap for about a week, I notice during that week I'm much hornier and much more inclined to go talk to girls, and now that motivation isn't there.

My advice to you, then that's a pretty good day, but if the worst part of your day is that you feel like less of a fucking man, that's not a very good day.

Day one again. Oh well.

I just wanted to share something: I feel pretty darn good most of the time.

I had two big problems from constant PMO when I started:

* I just wasn't really horny enough to pursue real women. Spent all my sexual energy on porn.

* Chronic low energy and low mood.

Well, it's *easy* to get up in the morning. Hey, I can put in 11 hours at work, and do a good job the *entire time.* Hey, women look *great.*""

Most importantly, health.

I don't want to say nofap is responsible for that. Hardly! Every day I'm paying the price in courage to grow. But without that *extra energy

As a brief update to my [fairly comprehensive report](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/sdpwz/day_215_full_report_tldr_alert/) of Day 215

* When last I reported, and my sex drive getting stabler, but it was still happening.  It is not happening anymore.  My libido is now the same from day to day.  It is present, and I am grateful to have it, throughout the day (it feels kinda nice to be horny, you know?), but it is very much under my control (which is even nicer).  The only time I start to lose control of my sexuality is when my fiancee is close.  And I think that's how it's supposed to work.  :)

* During most of my NoFap, but it was an outlet for me.  A few weeks ago, we were at a marriage prep class put on by our church, and the lecturing priest suggested that all the engaged couples give something up until the marriage as a way of preparing -- like during Lent.  He was thinking a fast from chocolate or soda, but my fiancee and I decided to fast from making out (my idea, not hers).  We're limiting ourselves to two or three passionate kisses at a time for the final four months before the wedding day.  When we started our fast, I was afraid that losing my one outlet would put me under pressure to fap again.  It hasn't.  Not one bit.  My sexuality is *mine* now

* I'm not *enjoying* this fast, it is succeeding.  But I can't wait for it to be over.  I miss her boobs!  I've also noticed that, without the physical side of romantic expression, I've been a lot more needy about the verbal/emotional side of it.  I've been unsubtly encouraging her to tell me she loves me a lot more, because her shuddering body isn't saying everything that needs to be said.  The physical stuff in a relationship is super-important, guys and gals!

* It turned out to be harder to quit porn than to quit fapping.  It's been a year since my last fap, though.  My main goal right now is to get 120 days of PornFree under my belt before my wedding day -- which leaves me with very little margin for error!

* There's no way I could have made it this far with my NoFap streak without severely cutting down on my porn.  There's also no way I could have made it this far with my NoPorn without quitting fapping entirely.  The two are inextricably linked for me.

* My social life has only continued to get busier, but, as I have to do so often, I'm going to haul myself out of this chair and hang out with some real people.  I'm doing this because I know that, by the end of the night, I'll be happy I did.

* Wet dreams are less and less common.  From once every three weeks or so

* A year ago, despite my best efforts, I would fap again within 24 hours.  Certainly I did not believe I would be able to top my previous record of 123 days.   If you'd told me right after my last fap that I'd be writing a one-year update twelve months later, I'd've laughed in your face (or possibly cried).  I had been through this cycle too many times to have any real hope left; all I had left was my stubbornness.  And yet here I am a year later.  Two lessons: (1) When NoFap finally ""clicks"", it may come not when you feel most hopeful, but when you feel most hopeless, and (2) be more stubborn than your masturbation habit.

I see people more for what they really are and look at women and think about them more as a person and wonder what their life is like.

Lately I have seen a trend of posts  proclaiming going for the first week/days of nofap and admitting to losing their virginity or having crazy sex and gaining some super human traits.

Now I'm happy for you but upvoting those type of posts only reinforces  false hope to the majority of the members here.

Also another thing that I have noticed is that when a member of the team fails they would post on how they feel they have failed... first of all you haven't failed

I have been relapsing for more than 5 months now and nofap itself has turned into trigger because it's a constant reminder of porn and masturbation and failure. 

Please try to motivate each other in posts and even contribute motivating material that doesn't entail on how you had steamy sex for the first time.

The nofap that I had felt in love with was about self actualization and enriching your own self in many ways that some of us had never thought was possible. Now it seems its main focus is about getting laid or losing ones virginity.

Many of you here are not addicts and I appreciate you guys as much as the next person who's an addict but please try to understand how difficult it is to try to quit a terrible habit for many years on and on while it has been eating at you until you're left with just a shell.

The nofap that I remember when we had less than 400 members was more of a finding ones self than becoming militant

Porn has been in society for a long time in the human psyche and only recently has become norm for people to talk about it and accept it as a form of recreational time.

Since we have become organized in through the inter webs lets please make the best use out of it as we have done throughout its course of life

Lets keep on going and reach our goals :)

Sorry for the long post but I had to get it off of my chest.

You don't have a girlfriend. You have few friends or you have friends but you can't spend a lot of time together. You have a busy life.

**If you fap**
You will feel very alone. You will feel desperate. You will feel sick. You will think that everybody else has a life worth living. You will think that everything you decide is the wrong decision. Even basic things like what to eat. You will think that there is no way in the universe that I can speak to that girl over there, it is you who made it happen.
Fapping takes this feeling away for a few moments. After closing the browser the result described above is back and now even more intense.

**If you don't fap**
You also feel alone. While being alone is certainly not the nicest thing in the world, you will find interest in yourself once you start to become distinct from all the other consumption addicts. Start something. Be social. Help people. Create something others can benefit from. Become interesting. Not only for girls. If you are not successful today then maybe some other day.

The first two weeks were really hard. I was very horny all the time, and not to touch my genitals. 

Over weeks 3-4, but sadness and anxiety. At this point my feelings seem to have thawed out for the first time in years, and I was emotionally all over the place, and crying very frequently.

Around day 35 I had a sexual reunion with my ex, and that I was much more emotional than before during sex. This didn't save the relationship, but allowed me to see that things were moving in the right direction, which motivated me for the long haul ahead.

After around day 20, I do have desires, but they're not sexual; I feel a strong desire for warmth and affection, and that's what pulls me to women more than straight physical attraction.

After day 35, that if I let down my vigilance I would fall off and relapse, but the rope widened to a plank, so that it took less effort to balance and I would only relapse by conscious choice. The main challenge was not fapping per se, but dealing with the big triggers, namely the continuing depression and loneliness of separation.

Around day 65

At day 75, but neither did I suffer from any lack of self-esteem as before. I just felt good to be in my skin. I also felt capable of talking about my feelings, both in relation to my situation and in relation to her. And I felt confident enough to get her number, and to follow up on the initial contact, so that despite some initial resistance we became friends and started seeing each other every day, or almost. She said what made the difference was my capacity to express my feelings so well and to be so natural. 

Yesterday, because I'd drunk a fair amount at dinner, but she didn't seem to notice and looked like she really enjoyed herself. Somehow the whole ED issue just didn't seem like such a big deal any more. We'll see where this goes from here.

A couple of other things to mention. I did hard-mode throughout these 90 days

What I did do, as these were pictures I'd taken - but, well, it was borderline. I deleted them several times, but then used file recovery software to get them back later. I guess I was still too attached. Now I intend to get rid of them for good, with some proper erasing software. So that was the weak spot in my 90 days. Not perfect by any means.

What also helped me a lot was doing art therapy classes every week, the only reason it worked in the first place was that nofap moved me out of the state of emotional numbness in which I'd been years. Exercise also helped - I've been doing martial arts regularly through this period.

One area in which I've had a lot of difficulty is work. My concentration is down, I'm doing enough to get by.

In retrospect, while my partner and children slept, seems so sad and such a waste of time and opportunities, whole years that I will never recover. 

All my gratitude goes out to you, so I can give back a little to the community. Thank you.

**My story starts like this:**

As most of you, fapping changed my perspective about sex, as time passed by I was needing more hardcore porn than before. I unconsciously jumped from fapping at magazines like Playboy to feeling unsatisfied with 1 fap per day on hardcore porn.

I felt like this had to stop... But what to do I asked myself ?

-Well stop watching porn my inner voice mumbled...

-No ! That's way too hard ! Said my ego. 

-Well let's try it for a while and see what happens I said to myself.

I deleted all my porn videos and promised to myself not to enter on any porn websites and only fap using my own imagination !

During this period (5 months)

How I felt ? 

Well I felt great

But why doing it better ? Why NoFap at all ? Am I a weirdo ? Who the hell doesn't Fap at all ?

**On 4th of February I was on my 6th day streak and I was almost preparing to fap when something changed my life !**

I have found you guys ! The NoFap Community ! 

I said what the fuck ? What is this ?

I could't believe my eyes
On that same day I also found out www.yourbrainonporn.com and read everything I could and made a decision ! 
I'm gonna do it from first try ! 90 days ! I know I can !

**The 90 day period:**

The first two weeks were the hardest

During this period I made some rules:

* 1. Don't break the chain - create your own chain here - http://dontbreakthechain.com
* 2. No porn seeing on my pc (not even images or text that trigger my mind into fantasizing about sex) 
* 3. No boner during hot showers
* 4. No dick touching except shower &amp; piss
* 5. No fantasizing about sex
* 6. If horny - push ups
* 7. If horny - cold shower
* 8. If horny - go for a run

Day 14-&gt;30, that helped me a lot !

Day 30-&gt;45 I started to feel really good, focus, discipline, I truly felt that ""If I can do NoFap for that long I can do whatever I want"" it was all inside me and now I have discovered it ! I started changing other things in my life, waking up early, no procrastination on silly things, these were my good days and NoFap was like an engine

Day 45-&gt;70 Don't you think that during the 90 days you'll experience only ""honey and milk"" feelings, when having bad days, not fapping gave me confidence. It felt like an anchor, helped me not to drift away. When a voice in my mind was putting to doubt my power of will, an other replayed ""How many friends do you have which have your power of will ? How many can maintain such a long streak ? You are a great guy ! Keep on with the good work !""

Day 70-&gt;90 I would've better killed myself instead of fapping, day after day, to lose it all for 5 seconds of pleasure ?
NO WAY ! I'm better than that !

**Conclusions:**

Why should I give up porn &amp; fap ?

First of all your brain will rewire, but you're not conscious of that, you think women also love being fucked hardcore like you see in movies.
Well, and they surely like being treated in this way.

You'll gain discipline, an accentuated sense of present than before, eliminate/reduce procrastination, etc.

It will help you during your bad times - Before NoFap when I had bad days, not sure of myself. 
Nowadays when having a bad day I ask myself: Who can do what I can ? Who can master his desires like I do ? 
Yeah that's me !

Love you all ! 
I'll continue my streak for... forever ! 
Don't lose faith in yourself !

**TL;DR**

* My story starts like this: If you can't renounce to porn &amp; fap
* The 90 day period: This one you got to read for yourself !
* Conclusions: Do you want to become a better person ? Do you want to be more confident on yourself ? A more disciplined person ? Don't you hate when you can't focus on your job ?

How I got here:
       I was dissatisfied with my erectile dysfunction that struck the majority of the blue-moon occasions which I have attempted to have sex in recent years. This past November, an activity I had taken part in for more than eight years, and the rewiring of your brain. ""3 months without that garbage will redo your brain,"" he quipped.
       I was curious. I weeded out porn and masturbation from my life to test myself; the compulsion dwindled to weekly use. I felt the same with and without it, per usual, I could not get aroused at all. I spent the remainder of that night puzzled: why did my mind want to deprive my body of pleasure? I curiously scoured the internet.
       A wealth of information appeared in the browser. I absorbed the topical knowledge

My life with porn:
       I am a college sophomore. Ever since Spring Break 2004 when I was a fifth-grader and my parents nastily divorced, had taken off not too long ago; tabs, tabs, tabs clouded my browser. The internet grew; my tastes changed. The activity manifested itself in the most inappropriate settings: My sister's room? My buddy's closet? My best friend's aunt's living room? My grandparents' house? There was an attached rush since I have never been caught handed. Thus, no one knew about what I did when I was not around, which added value to the vice's allure.
       My thrilling search for products of the highest quality bloomed amidst the internet-porn industry's bubbling—more appropriately, Brazzers—to whatever I could find account information. Gathering functioning passes to these quality sweets made my month; their eminent disappearance ruined it. **The unreal image of large asses and huge penises was my primary representation of sex**. I was not sexually active with the outside. I would not succeed with women I lackadaisically pursued; I had not had a girlfriend, my first and only, since 2009. I allowed my umbilical porn tie to dominate me.
	More recently, his exposure to pick-up artistry, his ability to laugh, his addiction to porn, and his desire to better his self. I admired him, and myself thus, for these traits. I heavily weighted S’s aforementioned fact: how my usage could figure into this. I toyed with the idea to gauge my response; however
       After finishing a paper that took an entire weekend to write, for my self-improvement, I made the boldest decision I could. I found my way onto r/NoFap and claimed my badge. December 19, 2012: after eight-and-a-half years, I embarked on…

My life without porn:
       (To preface, other negative qualities; ultimately, my addiction to porn/fap. In May 2012 I was rejected by the girl I crushed on after making my infatuation explicit; I was terrified of rejection for my entire life. This was the first time I did something like this. I felt great afterward, regardless: being rejected was much more satisfying than remaining uncertain! Two months later, I was able to love myself when I looked in the mirror. I finally erected the self-confidence I needed to persevere. [(These two events influenced this.)](http://youtu.be/LOrGxxNEhy4) My relationship with my parents improved, especially my father. Despite a loving relationship, I never voiced my desires and dissatisfactions toward him—or anyone in my life! I finally spoke to him as an adult—honest—and our relationship has been great since. The next semester, others—perturbs me ineffably. Again
       My decision thrilled me. I informed those closest to me of my plans; various friends of excess scoffed
       I wore the spirit of NoFap on my sleeve. It was most efficient for me to do so. **The effects of NoFap are true; zeniths in self-confidence, clearheadedness, among other intangibles are optimally reached. These are self-fulfilling; they need to be.** I never experienced the magnitude of these qualities until now. From an early age, I allowed porn to sculpt me into a bookish recluse who socially failed. Any shortcoming in my life could be generated into a fap excuse; this ultimately squandered my impulse to do anything—fap was my release. Now, I decided against release, in my traditional sense. The energy—oh, the energy!—I applied toward my excursions was now used elsewhere.
       A list of what I have accomplished over this 90-day period:
	
* Travelled to Kyrgyzstan. [(It looks a little something like this.)](http://imgur.com/a/KJGLa) I recorded over an hour's worth of golden material. I am compiling it into a short film at snail's pace due to other priorities. It is beautiful. This trip revitalized my desire to travel
* [Totaled my car](http://i.imgur.com/MAoXFGr.jpg). I tapped an ambulance's back wheel.
* [r/NoPoo](http://reddit.com/r/nopoo). No more dandruff.
* Had one of my first wet dreams. I estimate having three before NoFap. I had a total of three during this period; most recent, so let it be noteworthy.
* Stopped smoking. I began smoking in August 2010; a carton would last me three weeks. I lost interest during last October, I am addicted to not being addicted to things.
* Listened to 231 albums. For me,000+ songs, 1,300+ albums. I listened to a fraction of that collection throughout the near-decade; there are albums on myPod that have been there for these years and are gone untouched. I enjoy having a response to the music: +/-. The immense jazz and electronic/ambient selections I have were incredibly suitable for the workload of my curriculum. The wavering qualities of the music amplified my challenging literature. I recommend: Steve Reich's [*Music for 18 Musicians*](http://youtu.be/E_jwv2QMtAo); Charles Mingus's [*The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady*](http://youtu.be/zl4-BshBIVA); a lot of Fela Kuti; Michael Jackson's [*Thriller*](http://youtu.be/3ppnY0yy-us_); Pat Metheny Group's [*Letter from Home*](http://youtu.be/pJE3QiLr92U) and [*Still Life (Talking)*](http://youtu.be/vHG5BYRZQIQ). I have to make time for more hip-hop!
* [Recorded this.](http://youtu.be/flTHzaCApEU)
* Dropped my phone in the sink. I upgraded to a smartphone, is analogous to fapping. It is keeping you from noticing the world around you!
* Read seven books. I used to be a voracious reader, allowing me to empathize with more people. [*No More Mr. Nice Guy!*](https://7chan.org/lit/src/Robert_Glover_-_No_More_Mr_Nice_Guy.pdf_ ) by Robert A. Glover is a great read for a lot of us at NoFap because we possess a lot of the characteristics he divulges—the characteristics which lead us to heavy fappage in the first place. Sigmund Freud's *Beyond the Pleasure Principle* was a peculiar read. I am currently reading a William Blake compilation and beginning *The Tao of Badass* today.
* Kissed two girls I knew from when I was in high school; I never made any advances toward them then but had always wanted to. Though they did not reciprocated, showered with four.) I also got two phone numbers today! I feel more comfortable around women. Whenever I have approach anxiety, I find a way to constructively get rid of it by going ahead: approaching. I am less anxious for the next time. I am becoming more understanding. Occasional dips into the lairs of r/seduction + r/askseddit, etc. have been beneficial. Also, it is not that women began noticing me. I began noticing them noticing me. It is (and it turns out that I am) a sight for sore eyes! Smile more in the streets.
* Watched 35 movies. The figure is relatively low considering I am an English major with a film concentration; however, Luis Buñuel's *That Obscure Object of Desire*, and The Marx Brothers' *Duck Soup* were my favorites of this period.
* Cemented my musical group and played my first show. I have found someone in my (college) town—we are from the same city in South Florida, outside of improvisations. Conceiving lush music, with another, is beyond rewarding for me. Currently writing, he and I will record material in the summer. It will be glorious.
* Drank no milkshakes. I used to pound three to four weekly. I crave sugary things more often than before. I often ignore these drives
* Cleared my history once. Let this speak for itself….
* Started yoga. A friend teaches at my gym. It is a beautiful way to start a Saturday. I feel great after! I also resumed my daily push-up routine with good results.
* Developed more fruitful relationships with men. After the age 10, little me. My mother taught me how to be a man; not my father. In the end, there was something missing from my equation. Much how Glover describes in No Mr. Nice Guy!, women cannot show men how to be men—men must do that. The man who portrays himself as the man that a woman wants him to be ends up setting himself up for disappointments. (This clearly influenced my minimal sexual past and my behaviors toward women: my empathy for them was staunch due to the victimization my mother portrayed during her messy divorce and depression. It is complicated, but not that much….) I have definitely benefitted from my new bonds and the camaraderie of those theretofore have been revitalized, too; including that with my father. I feel awesome about this. It has allowed me to view myself and women much more healthily.


       There are plenty of things I have not listed. Everything provided in this massive body of text ought to leave you with the impression that r/NoFap has made a positive difference that I could not have predicted when I first claimed my badge.

You have clicked on this post for the first time, however, you ignore this advice, then confirm that what you are going to do next is this:


**Go to your favourite porn website to look at people having sex because you aren't.** You have decided that you will go and toss off a dude (yourself) over fake imagery of people getting sex because you can't get it. Hell, rubbing a dick over some coloured pixels on your screen. You may also output bullshit excuses like ""It's natural. Masturbation is not bad because it's natural."" Yeah, it is natural. You are just doing a job your primal self is designed for. A job of *impregnating a computer screen.*


Now, and you go hard just thinking about them while the webpages load. Or maybe not. Maybe it would take a while to raise your staff of life because you suffer from ED - **the main reason you joined NoFap.** Well, why the fuck are you resetting your progress then? Why would you prefer to spend 10, 20, 30 minutes, or hell, a whole hour working a guy's shaft over pixels, why?*


Go ahead and ask yourself, first look at your badge - a sign of how far you've gotten, and then ask yourself ""Is it worth it?"". Is it worth wasting time that you could have spent getting closer to achieving your goals just to fuck up your brain and feel good for 3 seconds, only to spend 5 minutes clearing it all up and being upset for the rest of the day that you've fapped, removing days, weeks, or maybe months of progress. Again. Is it? **Is it worth it?**

Beyond that when I was riding my bike yesterday, or a little happy baby in her carriage. It was just a feeling of... almost euphoria.

My wife is an intelligent, she's never been addicted to anything in her life and has generally succeeded at everything she's done on the highest levels, so her expectations for herself and the people she surrounds herself with, including myself, are very high.

For this reason I was really hesitant telling her

The last 2 days have been freaking spectacular. I wake up and have nothing to hide. We've had fan-freaking-tastic sex the last 2 nights. She helped me set up k9 on our computers without being a 'parent' about it

Each morning she also has sent 'ideas' of things I can do to keep myself from relapsing/ get away from the computer. These are less of a 'honeydo' list and more of an 'i want to help' list. It is great because I can directly benefit myself and my wife and our relationship instead of fapping. 

Telling her has opened up a level of communication I didn't think I'd have, the sun rising by the end. It was great, cause we just got to focus on each other, talk about us, and be honest with each other, and enjoy the beauty of a sunrise.

Lastly, and I know that she'll let me know when she sees the signs. That feedback will be excellent, I already know.

If you're married or in a committed relationship, SO good. NoFap is actually easier and I feel supported by more than just a great group of people online here, but also the most important person in my life. It is awesome.

I never could articulate why fapping was so bad, and would always justify PMO (mostly to softcore stuff), but the negative psychological effects were rather profound.  Walking around as a shell of a human being, unable to hold eye contact, inch by inch.

My only fear is relapsing in a time of sadness, time of tiredness, or any other triggers.  The fear is a necessary reminder how much I went through to get to where I am.  The addiction ran so deep I can remember squeezing the side of my stomach as hard as I could as I sat and endured the urge to fap, I can remember making a 100 sticky notes all over my desk each with a reason why not to PMO, I can remember devling as deep as I could into an MMORPG with the primary purpose to escape life and run from my addiction.  Now it's much easier as I think my brain has fundamentally changed and the neural pathways for PMO have been very weakened, success is breeding success. 

Fellow fapstonauts, we stand against our sheep-like fapping society, we stand against porn and all its lies, though we may falter... champions are forged through the fire of trials.  We get up and try that one last time to the bitter end with the hope that there is a light at end of the tunnel as the darkest hour is just before the dawn.  

Thank you everyone, and helping me every night as I read your success stories, your struggles, your failures, and witnessing the resolve to form a better-you.  God bless everyone.  ",,False,t5_2skrn,True

It was Saturday night, and called it a night.

Since porn and fapping wasn't an option

I met a hot girl

In the past

But since this wasn't an option, as someone with confidence issues with women, this was a huge victory for me. Again, this can be directly attributed to nofap.

Funny in hindsight

Thought I'd had a fap session before work (was on a late shift).
Loaded porn on my iMac *(side note: I fap standing up, tissue paper placed on my desk - for the sperm)*.

What I anticipated as being a quick session had now become a 1 hour affair. I started feeling a numbing/tingling sensation in my right leg, big bang, I hear my brother walking upstairs, I'm thinking ""*shit, this is going to be awkward*"", so I attempt to get up to hide the 20+ tabs of porn I have open, and also to cover my decency, my right leg unable to support me (due to pins and needles).

So I lay there for a minute, I immediately closed the browser and shut my iMac down.

Right then
I've just spent 1hour masturbating to the point where I fell down due to pins and needles

So yeah

I don't think about masturbation or porn anymore on a daily basis; it has been replaced with other things in my life that are much more important. In fact, in a few months. I no longer have to battle the thoughts of ""am I going to watch porn and masturbate today?"" That is a battle I won long ago. When I think of porn, I think of how disgustingly and wrongly it portrays sex, and the relationship between man and woman in general. I no longer think of women as sexual objects--I have many female friends who I appreciate not for their physical or sexual traits, but rather for their amazing personalities. Aside from that, I have seen great success in other areas of my life--This past semester, I had the highest grades I've ever had throughout high school (I'm going to be a senior)

I plan on continuing this streak. It would be nice to go for 2 years. For those who are just starting out, but the results you have yet to yield will be truly incredible, and brief periods of superficial gratification will only serve to continue to restrict you from achieving this sense of REAL gratification. This year, I have learned so much about who I am and what I believe, and that extends far beyond the realms of this no-fap business. It would not be an exaggeration to say that this past year has been the most important year of my life. Stay awesome, fapstronauts, and keep at it. It's worth it in the end...I can finally say that from personal experience.

I have been porn-free for close to 150 days

I want to address this to the all fapstronauts who are focusing on getting women.

###A. NoFap + Focus on Women = Frustration &amp; possible relapse.###

1.) When you sit there and drool over every pretty woman, which is rewarding your brain (albeit not as intense as porn), and it tells you that being a spectator, muttering to yourself *""Mmm...dat ass is fantastic, I would tap that all day, everyday""*, and not approaching her - is more rewarding than actually approaching her.
 
2.) You look for the validation of women to make eye contact with you; or give you a sign that they see you as attractive

3.) You end up losing focusing

4.) Then you Fap and/or watch porn

5.) You're back to square one.

###B. So How Am I Suppose to Attract Women Without focusing on it?###
-  There is a surplus of guys with sex drive.
-  There is a surplus of guys who can suppress that sex energy with porn.
-  There is a surplus of guys who can express that sex energy with staring at women all day and fapping when they get home.
-  There is an extreme **shortage** of men who can express that sexual energy in a positive manner.

###C. So What Are You Telling Me To Do?###

Read This:
[Think and Grow Rich - Napoleon Hill] (http://www.sacred-texts.com/nth/tgr/tgr16.htm)

###D.  The Benefits of Controlling Your Sexual Energy###

1.) Apply it to exercising

2.) That same persistence that you had when you spent hours to find the PERFECT video to get off to in porn?  Remember that?  That persistence will be everywhere in your life.  You'll be productive for hours upon hours on end without even knowing it

3.) You will stop focusing on women, but I don't care.  In fact, when a woman asks for my number, I get kind of annoyed now.  Mostly because, I have the confidence to approach her, if I didn't, then there's a reason. (sorry to sound like a douche)

4.) Your personality will be magnetic

5.) When you do find that one beautiful woman that does catch your eye.  Something will happen; it will be second nature, **in my life**, until I focused my sexual energy on self improvement.

###E.  Legitimate Arguments Against This###
- *Men are hunters, men are also meant to attract women by showing off their status. etc.

- *You can't get girls unless you focus on them and be aggressive* - This is a legitimate argument, etc; but there's a certain way to do it, have you ever met those ghetto dudes (of every race, mind you) who holler at women from across the street?  ""AY MA! LEMME GET YO NUMBAH!"" - Has never worked once.

And there's probably more, NoFap and Sexual Transmutation is a snowball effect, but eventually you'll see huge improvements in many aspects of your life.

Thank you guys, goodbye.



**TL;DR - Stop focusing on sex.**",,t5_2skrn,1361296223.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/18ttvu/nofap_is_incredible_absolutely_life_changing/
1354446353.0,145b83,90 days completed. Here's my story,MyNoFap,179,24,63,"First of all a quick backstory. Mastrubater since I was a 12 year old kid. It kinda started when I saw an erotic CD of my father. Since then it kind of got out of hand. At age 20 I barely had any social contacts anymore, since every male that has hit puberty now watches porn. I myself thought that it was due to an increased libido that I watched so much porn




The first few days are hard in their own way. You become steadily more horny every day untill you hit about 2 weeks (at this point I was at my best mood




Needless to say

-School

-Started playing piano, practise makes perfect. I might be looking into lessons in the future, since I know I barely can improve on my own now.

-Reading. This opens a new world to anyone. There's just so much to learn from books. Currently I am reading the great Gatsby and the book of five rings by Miyamoto Musashi (I would recommend this to anybody who does martial arts).

-Lifting weights. Great way to relax and chill with bros. I already did some karate before

-Homebrewing. I make my own booze from apples. Shit is good man.

-Being a test subject for science. That's how I earn my moneys.

-Knitting. Difficult to start with and very monotonous. I still suck at this but one day I will make my own flag/clothing piece.

-Having my social life back. I started going outside my house again.




Before NoFap I was a kissless-virgin who didn't have any female contact whatsoever. During my stay here, still a virgin though. This all is kinda weird, because I am still oblivious when it's about women. People tell me often enough that I am attractive and that some girls are really into me. I am just not picking up the signals. That doesn't bother me that much anymore. Life is just way too awesome to be worried about the petty things. 




And maybe the best thing that has changed for me. People start to respect me. I am talking about strangers, because I've become so much more daring when it comes to women and everything. My dad (mr. so-you-climbed-mount-everest-pussy-I-climbed-the-everest-without-ropes-and-oxygen) is proud that I finally took control over my life and has started complimenting my achievements. A little side note, he rarely gives compliments to anybody, if he says you are good then you are good. He knows something is up. My grades are higher than those of my friends at school (not yet one of the best, but they will be one day), and they are impressed by my wits. This is a new weird feeling. I never had this before, I was that average guy.




If you ask me now if I am cured, didn't edge though. My next step will be becoming completely free from porn.




You guys are the best
