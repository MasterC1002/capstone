I'm a relatively new user of Reddit but I have discovered a bit of an annoying aspect that I'd like to request a future enhancement. I love the unread tab in the message area for new updates to the posts I've made, could I donate, etc...  

I would like the ability to turn off inbox private messages on my account.  Mabye with an option to allow messages from moderators.  

OR - maybe separate out the tabs so unread replies to posts are on one page and unread private messages appear on a separate tab that I can choose to ignore.

I thank you for your time.

1332626903.0,rbwn4,Rank threads and the frontpage by discussion rather than by voting.,MYGODWHATHAVEIDONE,905,300,25,"Currently

The frontpage can be ranked by: Hot, and Top

Comment threads can be ranked by: Top, Controversial, Old, and Best

All of these ranking systems incorporate those same three elements – upvotes

A fourth element should be added: **discussion**.

One of the main complaints featured across reddit is the decline in content: links that do not attract good discussion and trivial comment threads dominating discussion.

Most of the observers over at /r/TheoryOfReddit have noted that voting tends to favor low-investment content: it's easier to upvote something simple

**Step 1:**

Adding a new way to rank comment threads would be a good first step toward allowing users who prefer thoughtful and detailed comments to be able to avoid pun threads full of dispiriting one-liners and stale meme jokes.  My proposal is not to get rid of upvotes, but to add a heavily-weighted fourth criterion which is: the **length of the comment and its children**.  This would prioritize comments that are both detailed themselves and those that generate subsequent detailed conversation/responses.  The aggregate length of an entire thread of one-liners might be outweighed by a different thread consisting of one or two long comments.

**Step 2:**

Add a new way to rank the frontpage

A major [quantitative study of reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/l8id4/did_digg_make_us_the_dumb_how_have_reddit/) noted that comment length on the frontpage declined – [older comments were 2–3x longer than those that appear on the frontpage currently](http://i.imgur.com/C8Dr2.png).  The author then demonstrated that the subreddits with the most trivial, pics, funny, videos, trees, wtf) also feature comments with the shortest length compared to subreddits with in-depth or intellectually-stimulating content (philosophy, truereddit

Ranking the frontpage based on the activity and quality of the conversation generated could produce a wildly different experience for users interested in engaging material and discussion rather than [low-investment fluff](http://www.paulgraham.com/hackernews.html).  Using some weighted combination of the following criteria could produce a frontpage ranked by quality discussion rather than by upvotes+downvotes+time:

* Average (or median) comment length;
* Total amount of comment text; and
* Commenting activity (comments per unit of time).

Hacker News already has an [alternate frontpage ranking algorithm that shows stories by the activity of discussion](http://news.ycombinator.com/active).  I believe their source code is open

**Potential Issues**

*First, but to change the weighting to favor comment length and discussion more heavily than the other traditional factors.  As far as upvotes/downvotes on the frontpage, I suppose they would still matter insofar as you want other people (especially those not ranking the frontpage by discussion) to see content that you value.  Finally, upvotes will still accrue to a user's karma as a reward for their contributions (or downvotes as punishment).

*Second, even though popular AskReddit threads generate disproportionately large numbers of comments.  Reddit has already developed ways to make sure that users' frontpages have a healthy mix of stories from gigantic subreddits and obscure subreddits, making frontpage placement relative to subreddit size.  The same mechanism should, in principle, work with a ranking system centered on discussion rather than voting.

*Third, and may actually make countering spammers easier.  It's harder to drive a thread or link up to the top of the rankings by [making detailed on-topic comments](http://xkcd.com/810/) than by clicking the upvote arrow.  Finally, unless ranking-by-discussion is made the default method of ranking the frontpage, it's unlikely that spammers and SEO agents will specifically target it for exploitation.

**Conclusion**

We need a way to preserve constructive interaction in the face of Eternal September's onslaught of trivial low-investment content.  People need to be able to see that the effort it takes to write out a constructive contribution to the community is going to be seen and rewarded rather than lost in a sea of one-liner stale jokes.

I suggest that we allow mods to categorise users to make this easier. As a *moderator*

However IMO their wording and appearance makes their function completely ambiguous.


The problem
--------------

Take this button: [-frontpage](http://i51.tinypic.com/jghc75.jpg).  There are two equally plausible interpretations:

* ""This subreddit is not currently on your frontpage.  (Click here to toggle.)""
* ""Click here to remove this subreddit from your frontpage.  (*i.e.

It turns out that it happens to mean the latter.  This was not my first interpretation.  The exact same ambiguity applies to this button

The color of the button does not help as a visual cue at all.  I interpret green to mean ""all systems go""; *i.e., this is not what in means on reddit.

A solution
-----------

The ambiguity in the text has to be removed.  It must be clear whether ""+frontpage"" is a *statement of fact* or a *possible action*.  The word ""frontpage"" is the problem here; a more effective word is ""subscribe"".  So either:

* ""subscribed"" and ""not subscribed"" (statements of fact)
* ""subscribe"" and ""unsubscribe"" (actions).

This should be implemented as an HTML form checkbox.  Everyone knows how this widget works.  Use background Javascript to update preferences

The only way I can see the utility of keeping our ""karma scores"" at all visible is when it interferes with our participation in Reddit.

**Discussion:**

I feel they are not getting at the root of the problem though.  

- Is it even feasible?  Perhaps only to a small segment of the population (gold) or as an option (like gmail used to have it)?  ([Aperculum](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/ct13j/add_ssl_to_reddit_login/c0v1z1g))

- I disagree with the observation in the post that it's not worth doing since a reddit account is not worth much.  A reputation is built up with an account, get somebodies reddit password, and then get into their email (or just get their email). ([robotsongs](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/ct13j/add_ssl_to_reddit_login/c0v14uf)/various)

- The performance issues shouldn't be that big of a problem:

**Why SSL?**

Encrypting all of Reddit prevents multiple attacks: ([DonutsCureCancer](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/ct13j/add_ssl_to_reddit_login/c0v220p)/[snoobie](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/ct13j/add_ssl_to_reddit_login/c0v1e1l))

- Doesn't allow you to modify the traffic stream

- Can't steal the password when you log in.

- There are also subtler things such as the sslstrip that would be prevented if you implement it in a certain way (taking away the ssl for certain pages) ([theMrDomino](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/ct13j/add_ssl_to_reddit_login/c0v11pi))

**Implementation:**

- Free SSL certs which work with modern browsers:  http://cert.startcom.org/ (thanks to [gschizas](http://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/ct0w5/community_effort_to_add_ssl_to_major_websites/c0v16pr))

- http://www.o3magazine.com/4/a/0/2.html

TL;DR Bullet Points:

- Bitcoin services allow merchants to accept btc from customers and instantly convert to USD.

- The BitCoin market has become both stable and liquid; signs that it is beginning to show signs of maturity and critical mass. 

- Reddit has an active BitCoin community that will likely immediately support Reddit Inc accepting BC for Reddit Gold. Instant monies. 

- Reddit Inc support for its BitCoin community will likely drive more users to those communities. More eyes balls. More ads. More Monies. 

- Upside more monies with little downside risk. 

- Cool creds.

So it has been [a year since this question](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/grz9l/allow_bitcoin_as_an_alternative_payment_for/) was asked. And in that time Bitcoin went through a bubble and pop; but more than that Reddit and Bitcoin are different animals than they were a year ago

First

- [Porn, we check on the cryptocurrency's progress.](http://arstechnica.com/business/2012/06/porn-gambling-and-malware-bitcoin-as-the-nets-wild-west/)

And some other recent coverage:

- [Bitcoin: Crypto-Anarchism and the Digital Money Revolution](http://www.policymic.com/articles/4980/bitcoin-crypto-anarchism-and-the-digital-money-revolution/category_list)

Okay. Normally, how it develops P2P further, the importance of anonymity blah blah blah BUT I think there is merit in just talking about the economic reasons for Reddit Inc to accept btc for Reddit Gold.

Since accepting btc isn't mutually exclusive to accepting Paypal

First

The risk that crashed the market last year

- [Bit-Pay Pricing Comparison for E-commerce Sales](https://bit-pay.com/accountingHelp.html)

For most businesses there's a valid question about whether its existing customers even use Bitcoin. Usually the driver to accept btc is in the hopes of targeting new growth from the BC community. But this question is alot easier for Reddit Inc, its a business decision that should show instant monies. 

- /r/Bitcoin 

- /r/GirlsGoneBitcoin

- /r/BitMarket 

- /r/bitcoinmining

- /r/decrypto

If the move is supported with a blog post supporting Bitcoin; it should also see interest from the wider Bitcoin community. It should begin a new growth snowball for the Reddit BC subs. This is an interesting spot because Bitcoin is likely to be overlooked as a growth opportunity by the other major social media sites. Reddit might hold its own for now in eyeball sucking AdviceAnimal memes but there's plenty of competition from FB, pinterest, twitter, w.e. So while there are specialist BC community sites, its a market that is likely to overlooked. Which is interesting considering they should be high value users, all they do is talk about money. Should reddit be an early adopter, it should cement its position among the majors social media sites for the BC community. In other words, more eyeballs

While the argument that Reddit Inc would clearly make more monies is airtight /s. This isn't an argument that the Bitcoin market gone mainstream

I can't attach probabilities to the above; but I think they make sense. But really in the end

As you can see, how many replies it has, what the vote score of these nearby comments is, *and it lets you upvote or reply to these nearby comments.*

In short

##Try it yourself

If you are a developer or you know how to run custom javascript in your browser

Go to any user profile page (even your own)

     var $messages = $('body.loggedin.messages-page .was-comment.recipient').add('body.profile-page .comment');
     $messages.each(function (iterator
         var $this = $(item)
             $link = $this.find('a.bylink:first')
             linkurl = $link.attr('href')
             subreddit = $this.find('.tagline a:last').text()
             $title = (($this.find('p.parent').children().length &gt; 0) ? $this.find('p.parent') : $this.find('p.subject a').clone().append(' [' + subreddit + ']').wrap('&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;').parent('h3'))
             context = '?context=3';
         if (linkurl.substr(-10) != context) linkurl += context;
         if (linkurl != undefined) $this.load(linkurl + ' .sitetable.nestedlisting'
             $this.prepend($title)
         });
     });


##What The Code Does

The javascript basically finds any comment on the page that's inside of a profile page or a messages page, pulls just the comment section from the context page, and injects it onto the current page in place of the original comment. In effect, it opens a small window into the ""context"" version of each comment.

##Caveat

Doing this breaks the API/Development guidelines for Reddit. It opens many simultaneous requests to Reddit's server with no respect to their 3 second threshold. Please limit your usage of this code as it causes an undue burden on Reddit's servers.

##What I Want

Because this would be impossible to incorporate into RES or a wide-release extension/bookmarklet/userscript

 * *Pitfall*: Users may flag their own accounts as bots for whatever reason - would have to be very careful that this didn't give them any special advantages

* A CSS class would be applied to any comment made by the account. It would moderators allow an option to distinguish the group of accounts.

* Moderator control panel options:

  * Bot whitelist

  * No bots option

* Recourse for unregistered bots - the ability for users to report them (I'd volunteer /r/reportabusivebots for the purpose

* High visibility and efforts to make users aware of this change (/r/modnews, /r/announcements posts), and a long grace period.

1267384918.0,b7jll,Implement more transparency &amp; accountability for the moderators.,dbzer0,70,10,81,"The recent [Saydrah brouhaha](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/b72yd/reddit_i_got_a_book_deal_thank_you_the_oatmeal/c0laugg?context=1) has put the possibilities for abuse of mod powers of reddit to the spotlight. A main reason for this is the lack of any transparency and accountability for mod functions which makes a lot of people paranoid on what is going on behind the scenes (and the lately implemented hidden mod chat does not help in this regard). It's stuff like that which lead to witch hunts like this.

I'd like to suggest two things which should prevent mods abusing their power in secret and/or people assuming this is the case and rising up in arms on non-issues.

1. Implement more transparency of mod power via an audit trail. This should be simply a public page which records and displays all mod events happening for all to see. Could look like this:
----

* Mod1 deleted [comment](http://linktocomment) at &lt;time&gt; - Reason: *Blah*
* Mod2 deleted [post](http://linktothread) at &lt;time&gt; - Reason: *Spam*

Or something like this. The reason would be the mod's own input on the act to explain his actions. This would then allow people to see if someone is doing something they shouldn't and call them out on it.

2. Implement more accountability via voting on the mods. This could be done by a) people simply having the capability to go to the list of mods and vote each up or down or b) by voting on their audit trailed actions. 
----

a) This would allow a mod who has become abusive and extremely unpopular to be demodded by public demand

b) would allow acts which go against the collective will to be undone. A mod actions that receives sufficient downvotes could be then automatically undone by the reddit system and the mod who is continuously having their mod acts undone could then lose their mod status.

These are just suggestions of course and may have many flaws I have not foreseen which is of course why I think it's a good idea to discuss them and see if they can be improved so as to avoid being abused themselves. 

Personally I'd love to see the transparency idea implemented since it's pretty harmless at least and would certainly reduce some of the conspiracy theories and paranoias and certainly act as a roadblock to power-tripping mods.",,t5_2qqhi,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/b7jll/implement_more_transparency_accountability_for/

Maybe cache these things and search against them all, weighting both against age and duration (So if a thousand subreddits all change their header to ""It's election day, go vote"" it doesn't skew results on ""election"" very much)

There are a couple of off-site mechanisms, well, off-site, and I think there's some inertia against that, since reddit is branded as a kind of one-stop clearing house for interesting places to go.  The problem is, how do you know where to go *on reddit* for interesting links.  And ultimately I think that results in subscriber pooling -- people don't really know to about a lot of the other small but active subreddits on reddit, so the already popular subreddits end up with swollen pools of subscribers who are essentially inactive.

There was a period there where subreddits were getting ads in the sidebar.  I remember one specifically for /r/bacon.  Don't know if those were paid or what

A better solution, similar to the one for promotions and announcements at the top of the front page, that cycles through submissions from lesser trafficked subreddits.  It could be put at the bottom of the front page, after the top-rated headlines from the user's subscribed subs, so that it remains relatively unobtrusive.  Each time you reloaded it would show the top-rated headline of that day from a subreddit that you're not already subscribed to.  That would give every user at least one chance to see subreddits -- and actual content from those subreddits -- that they might not otherwise see without having to either go off-site or spend hours (like I have) digging thorough the subreddit listings.

Inclusion in the pool of sampled subreddits could be a toggle feature in the moderator's permissions for each subreddit.  That way

Part of the reason for the shift in my opinion is the friction I ran up against in trying to get /r/advocacy up and running. Not the objections of other redditors – those subsided pretty quickly, it's been growing increasingly essential for other new subs as well.

The common wisdom around Reddit is that just about any problem can be solved by creating a new sub. I've definitely started my share of alt subs to provide outlets for submissions that don't quite fit into the default set. And once upon a time

The gist of it is that it's no longer really feasible to get anywhere on Reddit without some sort of boost from one of the defaults. All of the subs I've seen go from tiny to mid-sized in the past year have done so on the strength of popular shout-outs in a default – usually AskReddit or /r/games. Moreover, luck plays a decisive role precisely where we should want collaboration and determination to do the lion's share.

The reason for all of this is simply that the defaults are huge, and because they provide the bulk of the material on the front page, Reddit is increasingly attracting people who are interested in the defaults, almost to the exclusion of the rest of the site. The increase from ten to twenty defaults back in October seemed like a good interim solution at the time, but in retrospect, I think it may have only exacerbated the problem by giving just enough variety to squelch newcomers' curiosity about the rest of the site.

I know this is something that's been on your radar for a while

The best solution I can think of is simply this: Pare the default set down to a single sub. Call it something like /r\/GettingStarted. It will be restricted, and what they can do to customize their subscriptions.

The effect is to put new users through the crash course in subscriptions. Without something of the sort, not to mention attempts to build strong communities without the backing of defaults, is only going to grow more difficult.",,False,,t5_2qqhi,,http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/t81lp/an_appeal_to_the_admins/

The Reddit community is currently precipitating in an unhealthy manner. It is becoming very top-heavy in where users are active. It might become unsustainable soon. There will be too many users that cannot find what they wish to find deep within Reddit, the lowest ranking default, /r/atheism, has over twice the amount of subscribers as /r/askscience, which has the highest amount of subscribers of any non-default subreddit (mainly because it was once a default). There is currently no reasonable chance that a non-default subreddit can beat a default subreddit in terms of activity or subscribers.

###A bleak future:  
The current system of congregation into default subreddits is causing Reddit to splinter into many offshoot subreddits. Some users are so deep in the meta/real/true/republicof hole that they do not even participate in the default subreddits. This is a sign that Reddit is getting so top-heavy that people are falling off. Participating in a community with so many voices and differing opinions makes your own opinions feel small and unimportant. You may start to enjoy other people's voices in the community less. This might happen until you find a smaller, but since defaults are not directing new users to smaller subreddits in comparable numbers, the community will not sustain. Say, for instance, you wish to find about a subreddit about a genre of music that you like, that isn't very popular? Well, there's r/music, r/yourgenre2, r/republicofyourgenre, and not many people there appreciate your style. The subreddits that feature your favorite genre are spread so thin because of the splintering

###A reasonable solution:  
First, with the option to have NSFW content if they check ""yes"" that they are 18+. This home page should also occasionally feature popular submissions to smaller subreddits as well, but subreddits should have the option of whether or not they should be automatically featured.  
Second, where more of its content will be featured on your homepage than other subreddits. Downvotes to a few posts from a subreddit will open up a floating dialog that will ask if they want to remove that subreddit from being on your frontpage.  
Third, downvotes, subscriptions, and removes from homepage is created, then have those things play into the sidebar suggestions for smaller niche subreddits that are more aligned with their interests. Users should have the option to only feature subscribed subreddits on their homepage, if they desire.

###Rationale:  
This will help spread Reddit to be less top-heavy. Smaller subreddits will be more exposed than usual. Users can find content that interests them more easily through a suggestion box. The ease of creating an account and using Reddit is not hindered, are on the homepage.",,False,,t5_2qqhi,False,,

* For each user

* (Upon implementing the feature, to 24 hours before ""now"", or further back)

* When a user unsubscribes from a subreddit

* Add an option in subreddits' settings for ""disallow votes from users that have been subscribed for less than 24 hours"" (defaulting to off) - or, moderator-settable number of days (or hours or whatever)

* Option A: In subreddits opting into this feature

* Option B: In subreddits opting into this feature

Obviously for both options there'd need to be a change to the vote-storing code to make sure people weren't submitting votes with, presumably, require any changes to the code that displays the voting arrows.

This would lessen the impact of meta-subreddits and brigading on vote counts in a couple of different ways:

1. It would require, and then vote the following day; and I feel like for most people that did this, being subscribed to a bunch of subreddits they didn't actually care about would become too irritating, and they'd give it up - essentially, the cost of voting on things linked by meta-subreddits would become too high for most users to care to do it

More specifically

 * The **age** of a user – if a user seenits several submissions estimated to be about eight months old, as many redditors lurked long before they committed to an account)
 * The **depth** of a user – if a user seenits several submissions within their age range estimated to have been around the third page of reddit
 * The **recency** of a submission – if a submission is seenit'd by many users estimated to be about four months old
 * The **popularity** of a submission – if a submission estimated at five months old is seenit'd by several six-page-deep redditors

The algorithms to determine this information would be fairly simple (I could provide them if necessary).  Since they rely on one another, **submissions would be hidden from a user if they are within both that user's depth range and age range**.  Ideally, this wouldn't be a binary hide/show, it would just factor into reddit's scoring algorithm for submissions which determines what lands on the front page.

This happens to inherently factor in a bunch of stuff that it should: if a particular user seenits everything, he/she won't seenit anything and will be marked as young, thus allowing him/her to see reposts just like any new user.

There is a [story](http://www.reddit.com/r/comics/comments/b6zte/folks_if_you_link_to_a_webcomic_they_like_is_it/) about how we should be linking to the original source and posting mirrors in the comments. Well I have been modded down for linking IMGUR mirrors in the articles before and this is a very sloppy way to handle mirroring.

I want mirrors because they are typically on websites I trust

My suggestion is that Reddit implements a way of enabling mirrors to be added robustly. Also, and maybe limit the number of mirrors to 5 of the top voted ones.

The best way to do this I think is to simply list them as [Mirror 1][Mirror 2][Mirror 3][Mirror 4] so that we don't have to click a link to get to the mirrors.

There are a few reasons for doing it this way:

* So Redditors can see the article if their workplace blocks it.
* In case the article is taken down by the original source for any reason.
* In case the [Slashdot effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slashdot_effect) hits (ok probably safe to call this the Reddit effect now but still... :)
* User preference: I would personally prefer to see something on IMGUR than the source

Okay and that is my suggestion. Thank you for considering!

A couple of the (very much appreciated) folks from r/reportthespammers helped me make a bookmarklet for reporting spammer accounts. During our discussion

Why not ban URL shorteners altogether? There's no point in them being submitted to reddit. Allow me to illustrate by example.

Let's say I'm hanging out on IRC somewhere and someone gives me a shortened URL (they're very common in text-based interactive systems IRC/MUD-family) to bit.ly, I have to load it in my browser... which results in a redirect to the actual URL which, in turn, is now in my browser's address field for easy copying to reddit.

URL shorteners have no place in reddit's submission process. I suggest banning them.

Just my $.02.

This is difficult for me at this time (see our conversation below), please consider submitting any of the ORIGINAL POSTS (using a url shortener/redirect to a spam site) somewhere in this thread.

A simple solution would be to give the mods of a subreddit the ability to approach a group of their users in order to conduct a survey. 

### Privacy 

In order to ensure the privacy of the users the mods should not be able to see who the survey was send to and who did respond. 

Additionally users could be given a option in their preferences that would exclude them from receiving these requests.

### How would the surveys be conducted?

Ideally reddit would provide the tools but otherwise limit it to certain services like google forms

### Who should be selected? 

Ideally the option would suggest a [group big enough to be representative enough](http://blog.surveymonkey.com/blog/2011/09/15/how-many-people-do-i-need-to-take-my-survey/) for the questions you want to ask. 

Additionally it should be a group of users that have been active in the past month in order to make sure it is a active group of subscribers. 

### Abuse? 

In order to limit abuse sending out a survey should be limited to once per month or an other period so users can not be spammed with survey requests from a subreddit. 

### Other. 

Since getting a feel for the users opinion is mostly a issue for large subreddits and also to limit issues with a to small dataset it is probably wise to limit this ability to subreddits over a certain size.

Our problem is that sometimes someone in our sub will say something interesting, but because it's interesting the world notices, and the world contains people who come into our sub and cause problems.

The typical thread there is not up-voted very highly

Every once in a while, and all hell breaks loose.

The problem is that once it starts getting high enough in /r/all, a highly voted thread in /r/Christianity! Yay! Time to say something heinous in order to hurt someone!""

One example was a picture someone took of his father's Bible. The guy's father is a pastor

Another case was yesterday. Someone's father died, and people up-voted this thread for some reason, and it got into /r/all, and I ended up banning some douchenozzle who suggested that our OP should die as well.

Who needs this nonsense? I don't need this nonsense.

We've got tabs already for Hot, and Controversial. I'd like to add one called Curated. It doesn't work quite like the others... instead, it's more of a subreddit-specific Saved list just like users here already have.

The moderators, unlike your own saved items which are just for you. It might also be interesting if posts that were added would show up a little differently in search results, just an asterisk or something to indicate that the post is considered one of the best in whatever community it was created.

What I think this does for us is make it easy to find a subreddit's best content. You might say that is already done by the top/all-time page

There are other uses for this as well beyond just a bestof capacity. For example

Sure, and then make a major edit to a wiki page on the weekend when we have more time available.

I can think of a lot of use cases for this. It doesn't seem like it would be particularly hard to do since the capabilities it would use are already available. Thoughts?

---

Editing in a blurb about why we would want to do this from discussions below...

Think of it this way. You hit up /r/nfl, cast AMAs, and really interesting discussions. Ditto for all TV show subreddits. Hit up /r/gaming and suddenly you're looking at all of the major game release threads. Hit up /r/f7u12 and under the curated tabs, everything there *actually makes you laugh for a change.* Over in /r/wtf you have to give up after five posts because they really are WTF and now your head hurts. Drop by my corner in /r/listentothis and find a cornucopia of *quality* obscure musicians to spend your dollars on and improve the awesomeness of your mp3 playlists 1000%. Hit up /r/askscience and read the most intelligent or exciting questions at a glance, visit /r/pics to see some really amazing photos, hit up /r/iama and find nothing but the best interviews.

It's like you are creating, and suddenly it's like browsing the fabled reddit of old where there are no crappy submissions. The content moves slower, but it is better, and you can take a 2 week vacation and come back to easily find the good submissions that you missed. You get a long-view of the subreddit, rather than the fast moving one from the main tabs.

It's not the same as the top pages, in others they will be radically different.

If you get a shitload of heavily upvoted posts (like askreddit does) you won't want to add all of them to the curated tab, you might want to add the overlooked gems to the curated tab. Their mods have tried creating weekly music digest posts, for example, but they can't stop them from being buried. Both ways, it'll be completely different from the top pages. Different subs, different content, different methods

One other difference I forgot to mention... acting as a 'saved' page

This is just a re-hash of some of the points I

The rational is pretty good:

* @ is almost never used in comments.

* It's easy to parse-out email addresses as they don't have spaces before the @.

* @ is pretty much the universal was of addressing others on most websites. (Even when there is no corresponding feature invoked)

* It makes more sense

* ~1880 is an an actual user


The reason I bring it up again is because it is live, it's confusing as it's implemented currently.  I've already seen ~5 comments using approximate numbers, and only one using it to link to a profile... sure, that's not much, but it's only been a day.

Since saving the stylesheet to see changes is something I do excessively

The top comment was some inane joke, and the comment below was a ""5 - Insightful"", and it really was insightful, and that got me thinking...
What if a feature was added to reddit whereby you could tag your votes? So you upvote, ""thought-provoking"" etc. And when you downvote you could also tag: ""off-topic"", ""offensive/inappropriate"", etc.  
  
Then, ""funny"" etc. The ranking algorithm could sum over the comment tree so that even if the root comment was ""Funny"" but the tree contained a very insightful discussion, the comments would be sorted so you could see them first.  
  
That way, and have a minor effect on small sub-reddits, but on large sub-reddits or posts with many thousands of comments it could make it a lot easier to sift out the wheat from the chaff.

Sure there's still plenty of quality content on reddit, they don't see much of the quality. So the new users we bring on will have a much lower expectation of quality than before. Something needs to be done.

Allow sub-reddit admins to select which reddit they want their postings to feed into.


It'd be nice if /r/gamingnews could feed into /r/gaming for instance. And people would take notice which sub-reddits their stories are being fed in from


Another benefit is that we'll be creating a self-organized community

**Implementation:**

Lets say /r/gamingnews wants to feed /r/gaming.

* /r/gamingnews admin makes a feed request to /r/gaming
* /r/gaming admin accepts the request.
* All new posts to /r/gamingnews show up in /r/gaming

Posts would show the specific sub-reddit in the details, but not the look and feel of the sub-reddit itself.


**Main benefits:**

* Incentivize posting to sub-reddits.
* Give people hope their niche post can reach a wider audience.
* De-incentivize posting specific content to larger reddits.
* Allow admins across sub-reddits to work and know each other better.
* A community built directory of how all the sub-reddits link together.

Multireddits are great because you get the top submissions from a wide variety of sources- sources of your choosing. You're not confined to a specific topic. If you want a multireddit that has all issues relating to gender rights

And here's the thing- it's my feeling that multireddits can be the future of reddit. They can become as integral to the reddit experience as subreddits are today.

**Here's my idea.**

Imagine that you can create a multi reddit by any name. You decide to create /m/pics. Yes you see that instead of /r/ we're using /m/ for multi. Then in this new sort of page, you would want to include r/pics, r/destructionporn, and r/cityporn among others. Perhaps you would include every pics subreddit that you could find on reddit. The point is that you would have a page that includes far more content than the current subreddit system can support- and you allow users to subscribe to that page like a subreddit without actually subscribing to individual pages of content.

From the subreddit standpoint,000 subscribers to /m/pics which contains r/destructionporn. So a subreddit could have direct subscribers as well as indirect subscribers.

What /m/ would do is open up reddit to even more exposure to the smaller more boutique subreddits without taking away their individuality and specificity. And it would allow new users to quickly jump on board with a lot of really great content by subscribing to just a few multi-reddits.

Allowing an /m/ to be css styled like a /r/ can be would also cause unique new communities to form. /m/ communities would be broader than /r/ communities and the content within /m/'s would evolve based on the subscription direction the moderators take. Suppose that the moderators of a /m/sports multireddit decide to keep it limited to more mainstream sports subreddits. Perhaps they remove the college based sports subreddits and keep it limited to all of the major league subreddits. Perhaps the moderators decide to add all of the NFL

Another unique thing about /m/ is that it keeps control still at the subreddit level. /m/ mods can only decide which subreddits to subscribe the /m/ to. They can't remove posts like mods of /r/ can. They can't delete comments either. All they can do is create a gathering place for subreddits and style it as such. They could communicate via the side bar and perhaps via submissions to the multi-reddit.

How does this idea sound? A viable next step for reddit?

**TL;DR - Changing the way multi-reddits work could be the next big step in the reddit experience. Allow users to create /m/ multi-reddits that they then moderate and add or remove subreddits from and allow the community to subscribe to multi-reddits.**

Not so long ago, in other words, be treated like the image equivalent of self.posts. That would, I think, remove an incentive for rehosting, reposting and general karmawhoring that is the unfortunate side-effect of some very good features.

One of the main objections that was voiced in opposition to that idea was that removing karma from Imgur submissions would simply push the abusers to other image hosting sites, et al. To an extent, I think that's probably true, but no other image hosting site is as trusted or as popular with redditors as Imgur. People serious about not posting images without getting karma in return might well go to another host, but the pay-off would likely be a fraction of what it is with Imgur. We as a community simply have more invested in Imgur, which is perceived as the image-based arm of Reddit. That said, I think there's a way to further reinforce the Reddit-Imgur association.

**In brief:** Make it official. Next to the ""text"" tab on the submission page

That would allow the admins to change the policy regarding karma for what are essentially image self.posts, which would provide a further disincentive for trying to work around the anti-karma-whoring tactic.

Instead replace it with when account was subscribed to a subreddit - much more meaningful for focused subreddits. This also ties in with annual trophies.

A subreddit of the week might help people to look at cool reddits. I'm talking about maybe more obscure reddits that don't often get a lot of traffic.

**How I think it might work:** First, potentially increasing it's traffic.

The really tricky part is how to choose the subreddit. I am well aware that you admins are already loaded down with work and can't afford to waste time doing things like this. Therefore

Keeping in mind that the original goal was to increase small subreddit traffic so as to increase the quantity and quality of content in growing subreddits, and if they like it they will potentially subscribe and submit content; second, the SROTW subreddit is a good place for those who are not sated by one subreddit a week can browse for quality content subreddits.

My only quip with this plan is with the SROTW button. I feel as though the ALL-RANDOM-FRIENDS-MOD buttons have not been significant features since their release and could use better real estate on the site; i.e.

Once again

However, you are thrust back to the frontpage containing default subs. I propose a page that lets you browse subreddits by category (eg have a video game category that when clicked on brings up /r/games, /r/gaming, /r/gamernews, etc), sorted by users, that allows the new user to see all related subreddits at once. This way they can remove things they have no interest in from the get go and subscribe to subreddits that are more focused with what they want to see.

From experience, i gave up. Most of the smaller subs I found were promoted in comment threads, which while lucky for those that see it is an awful way to promote subreddits.

1341336240.0,vzk0j,A modest proposal: time-weighted voting (time cost per upvote) to suppress the lolcatastrophe,drzowie,25,3,21,"All social media suffer from what I've termed the *lolcatastrophe*: when forum size exceeds a certain limit the forum gets full of shallow stuff (""lolcats""

Everyone here is familiar with that problem.  Current attempts to get around the lolcatastrophe include heavily moderated groups like /r/AskScience and depth-dedicated groups like /r/DepthHub and /r/BestOf (and even /r/TrueReddit

Voting media like reddit are great

Well, a task for which we need to thank the [Knights of New](http://www.reddit.com/r/knightsofnew).  As the subreddit grows, the New tab gets harder to wade through, and rapidly upvotable posts (memes, knee-jerk sensationalist headlines, and lolcats) get a serious advantage.

I propose to knock out the shallow-post advantage with a simple technique: assign upvotes and downvotes based on the elapsed time (with no other Reddit activity) between *retrieval* of a post and *upvote* of the post.  This requires a floating-point (or fixed-point fractional) upvote/downvote score

I suggest a logarithmic scale (value of upvote grows logarithmically with time) to raise the cost of cheating (e.g. waiting an hour to drop a downvote bomb)

Time-weighted voting combines two ideas for improving the voting system:  costed voting (it costs time to upvote) and using reading time as a heuristic for the ""depth"" of the post (thereby extracting some further information about post quality from the user's behavior).  It is not perfect

The vote weighting calculation could be performed in javascript on the user's computer for initial rollout.  This saves effort on the server side

As an added bonus, or for a very long time scale.

Using a fixed point vote system would not necessarily involve changing the schema of the Reddit database. It could be implemented by multiplying all existing vote scores by (say) 100 and keeping them in the same integer field.  If that is onerous

1. I get a reply.

2. What I ask for gets done.

3. Nothing happens.

This system is poor because of lack of feedback in two of the three cases.  I do not know if my report was welcome, without a resolution, I don't know if it happened because the admins agreed with my report, and I should report more of that, or if the Reddit took action for some other reason.  If I was cynical, which I am not, I might feel that the admins were ignoring my reports in favor of others.

The zero-feedback thing is very difficult for those of us who are trying to make Reddit better via reports.

It would be much better from a user involvement standpoint if requests could be picked out of admin mail and put into a bug tracker of some sort, and resolved there, in such a way that the whole thing isn't the black hole that it is now.

----------------------------

I just read about the [Massively parallel crowd-sourced JavaScript app server cloud](http://www.nonblocking.io/2008/12/massively-parallel-crowd-sourced.html) proof of concept. This proof of concept does distributed computing

We could call it ""HiveMind"" ;)

**The Idea:**   
The admins could put together a service that sells computing time much like the current self-serve advertising service. Customers could purchase computing time in various units

Users would be able to opt-in and provide idle cycles to Reddit. All the data crunching would be done in the background as you browse Reddit. For the most part

All of the computing time would be donated to Reddit by its users. This would allow Reddit to provide a huge amount of computing time to various customers/organizations with relatively little maintenance cost.

**Requirements:**

1. A robust distributed computing system written in Javascript.
2. Integration of the distributed computing system with Reddit.
3. A customer portal similar to the self-serve advertising portal.
4. An API allowing customers to provide data to be crunched.

**User Experience:**

It is critical that we do not impact the experience of the Reddit user in any way. As such

1. An opt-in/opt-out mechanism for donating your idle cycles to HiveMind.
2. The ability to set the maximum amount of CPU you want used at a time.* It would be best not to saturate the user's CPU
3. The ability to set the maximum amount of ""Units"" you want to donate per &lt;time period&gt;. This could be used to prevent Reddit from skyrocketing your power bill.

*I don't know if this is even possible with Javascript. Hopefully it is.

**Further ideas:**

1. A screensaver or background process that accomplishes the crunching work for when you're not on Reddit.
2. Badges/Rewards/Karma/Gold Membership for donating computing time?

Thoughts? Ideas? Input? 

Edit: Perhaps we could also offer to provide computing time to various free organizations like SETI and FOLDING. We could have checkboxes in the user preferences that allow you to put some of your time toward these types of projects.",,t5_2qqhi,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/ehbgw/reddit_needs_money_reddits_greatest_asset_is_its/

1267974454.0,babc1,Moderator mail is great!  A few suggestions for improvements follow.,S2S2S2S2S2,20,2,5,"- Pappenheimer pointed out that the users don't see the same thing when they message the mods.  Make the interface the same for users so they understand the threaded nature of the discussion.

- Here's my biggest concern: What if I go away for two weeks.  I'll have tons of unread moderator mail.  Which is fine, I can probably skip reading r/pics and just *hope* they were all answered.  That may not be the case, though.  Furthermore, I would not know if there *were* unanswered moderator messages, especially on the smaller subreddits.  What if there's one where I'm the only moderator?  What if I'd have ten like that?  I'd have to check each one to see if there were unread and thus unanswered moderator messages.  The whole thing seems inefficient at best.  I propose messages that were unanswered by any mod have their own tab (or, less ideally, highlight color).

- The auto-collapsing is weird.  I don't get it.  Read comments should always start collapsed

- Pappenheimer has also said that the ""unread"" demarcation seems inconsistent.  It's not always marked as unread even when it is.

- Why do i see old messages from subreddits from before i joined?  I started moderating a new subreddit and I see ""unread"" messages from weeks before I started moderating there.  Well... Obviously I couldn't have read those!

- It would be nice to have a button to start new ""threads"" from within moderator mail rather than having to go to the subreddit.

Basically the discussion which prompted this idea focused around Reddit becoming more popular and the quality of the default subreddits taking a hit as more and more users joined the site and had less and less idea of how to function as a part of it. I'd seen that same topic crop up more than once and always the response is to encourage the user to find smaller subreddits. It shouldn't have to come to that. This is the main bulk of what I wrote:

&gt;One suggestion is to have a second step on registration suggesting subreddits you may be interested in. You can choose to ""stick with the defaults"" or ""customise your experience"" right off the bat. The second option will have you put in things you like (Cooking/cars/painting/software/classic films/literature

&gt;For example, /r/askculinary, /r/tonightsdinner, /r/52WeeksOfCooking and you click which ones you like.

&gt;These options should be preceded by a sentence or two which is carefully written to say its only an option and will also enchance the experience of using the site

&gt;What this will accomplish, which will a) relieve the load on the default subreddits and b) diversify the new user's experience, meaning that he/she will be exposed to many subreddits at once and their communities which, hopefully will give them a deeper understanding, quicker, of what the reddit experience will tolerate and is about.

&gt;I'm not going to pretend that this will prevent default subs from fluxing in and out of quality sinks every couple of months or so

I would like to hear feedback, how you would see it working and so on. At this point in time I can only see one potential down-side to it and that is it will take registering from being a one-page affair to a two-page affair. Effectively doubling the amount it takes to create a new account. This is superficial and can be addressed. Firstly, make the second step optional. Actually, that's the only thing you need to do. The other thing you need to do, is remind new users that they can branch out. Run internal ads which can suggest this tool to users whose age is less than two months.

This'll be quick.

I don't like having to wade through truckloads of inane comments when I'm trying to find or follow a discussion

Here's a quick solution to keep everybody happy.

Place two radio buttons above the comment entry input. One says ""Fun""

Fun is always selected by default.

If you want to post something serious, let's face it, we're more likely to make the extra half a second effort.

Then at the top of comments add a drop down/link buttons/radio buttons/whatever, everyone's happy and we can co-exist in peace and harmony.

[This was mentioned three years ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/9ink4/x_liked_it_is_awkward_for_some_titles/)

The usage of 'like' and 'dislike' is confusing for new users and helps cement people into thinking that downvotes are for things users do not like or agree with. 

Reddiquette states the following about voting;

&gt;If you think something contributes to conversation

**Controversial**

By sorting by the feature you see posts or comments that have been upvoted and downvoted heavily. The usage of the word ""controversial"" enforces that the content displayed will be opinions that are in heated debate. How can upvotes and downvotes alone be used to display such information if they are meant to be used for content that does or does not add to the discussion. These mixed messages further the confusion for new and old users alike.

***

Please make these small subtle changes to help prevent people downvoting things they do not agree with. These changes could help stop reddit from becoming an echo chamber that deters people from posting their own honest opinions.

2) [A random idiot on the internet call them out for reasons that remain unclear](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/end1m/do_not_donate_to_the_kidney_person_it_is_fake)

4) [The anonymous kidney donor putting up a thousand pictures of his guts](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/enffi/redeeming_myself_i_am_a_kidney_donor_i_always/) to prove that yes

5) The mob that had so recently been demanding the head of the kidney donor suddenly [demanding the head of the mod that did their bidding.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/end1m/do_not_donate_to_the_kidney_person_it_is_fake/c19fk0f)

In effect, and the only reason not to do it is because there's about a million and one reasons not to do it.

I think there's a big misconception about what mods do and what powers they have.  I don't think that will change easily.  However, cooling the jets of the rabble that mostly wants a head on a pike, they don't care which one.

By my count, in my opinion, become a big motivator in Reddit behavior and also provide a great deal of community.  Yet we don't do anything to acknowledge our Moderators.  And frankly, moderating a 100,000-person internet community should be at *least* as recognized as ""[contributing a photo to the sidebar.](http://blog.reddit.com/2010/10/fun-in-sidebar.html)""

###WHAT IF:

Every subreddit has a list of moderators.  Suppose we bump the names in that box over 20 pixels, it turns blue.  They stay that way for a month.  At the end of a month, every redditor whose name is next to that arrow gets the total number of points (up or down) **divided by the number of subscribers in that subreddit.**^1  And on blog.reddit or /r/announcements, the admins announce the top 20 or so moderators for the month, and give out trophies to the top...5?  10?  1?  

Dunno.  But having your work as a moderator recognized would probably be more impressive to the holder of the trophy and more useful in building community than those infernal ""well-rounded"" trophies.  Having a monthly reminder that this entire website runs largely on community self-policing would go a long way, a list of subreddits moderated by the winners would serve as handy advertising for the subreddits that are being moderated well... and if the community shifted from poorly-moderated subreddits to well-moderated subreddits, the whole community would run smoother.
