**Reminder** [Police are insisting that all photos

&gt;As a little background as to why any information/photos/videos could be helpful:
I'm not sure if they touched on this, and where they went. With the amount of coverage the marathon got, it is very likely that the person who placed the device is on camera several times. As an investigator looking at this situation you could perhaps follow somebody by seeing them first on a traffic camera looking suspicious. You could then follow them through several different peoples photos and see where they went and over what time span they went there. You could gather enough evidence to justify putting out BOLOs for specific people needed for questioning.

&gt;If you have ANYTHING; a photo of yourself eating breakfast in Copley, a picture of your friend or family member as they finish the race... all of it is useful or potentially useful.

* [6:52 am GMT] Reuters is quoting a source in saying the targets are Fateh-110 missiles in transit from Iran to Hezbollah. [Here] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fateh-110) is the wiki page on the missile.

* [5:47 am GMT] A few of you are questioning the Iranian presence in the Golans. This is not confirmed and instead is simply there to answer people's questions as the rumors spread. There is no evidence as to Iranian presence in the region and thus cannot be verified or confirmed. Apologies over any mis-communication. It seems only rumor websites in the region are being updated

* [5:20 am GMT] Talking with some of my sources

* [5:04 am GMT] Reports that Iranian Military [5:35 am GMT] is possibly (Israeli Radio) on the Syrian side of the Golan Mountain Range - This is unconfirmed and speculative. I am mentioning this to keep track of all information.

* [3:21 am GMT] I would like to take the time to address a few rumors. No reports on this 'nuke' that is trending on twitter, quite a few are from the Friday Strike.

* [3:12 am GMT] RT is citing a local journalist reporting 300 people dead and a total of 4 blasts striking the area.

* [3:04 am GMT] The BBC is currently playing a phone interview to a local journalist(?) of people experiencing a minor earthquake before the blast. In his words this could indicate an underground structure being attacked. This is not confirmed - Just the latest on BBC news.

Let's Find Their Son.,BR0STRADAMUS,1211,178,165,"Sunil Tripathi has been accused of being Suspect 2 in the Boston Marathon bombings for hours on reddit and all over Twitter.


His name has been trending for the past 4 hours. 

Many posts and tweets have been calling for his death or pain on his family.


We did this.


Maybe we didn't mean to


The downside of instant journalism is that we sometimes get things wrong. And sometimes media outlets can take this false information and run with it.



Hours before the media blitz and craziness of this night posts in /r/FindBostonBombers called Sunil out by name



When did imaginary internet points become more important than helping an investigation



The point is

**EDIT:** The supposed originator of the Suspect 2/Sunil comparison photo has apologized on Twitter. Hopefully more media outlets will follow suit.



**EDIT 2:** [Sunil's family posted this on Facebook a few minutes ago](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=417287098368653&amp;amp;amp;l=55bda423e6)

&gt;A tremendous and painful amount of attention has been cast on our beloved Sunil Tripathi in the past twelve hours.

&gt;We have known unequivocally all along that neither individual suspected as responsible for the Boston Marathon bombings was Sunil.

&gt;We are grateful to all of you who have followed us on Facebook

&gt;Now more than ever our greatest strength comes from your enduring support. We thank all of you who have reached out to our family and ask that you continue to raise awareness and to help us find our gentle


**EDIT 3:** Buzzfeed and various contributors who initially posted on Twitter false confirmations that Sunil was Suspect 2 has scrubbed their twitter pages and refuse to apologize for inadvertently hurting an innocent family. @BuzzFeedAndrew ",,t5_2rgzp,1366417734.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/inthenews/comments/1co5o1/we_owe_sunil_tripathis_family_an_outpouring_of/

**TL;DR:** Hundreds of people were likely injured in a fiery explosion on Wednesday night at a fertilizer plant near Waco, authorities said. The blast was reported at about 8 p.m. CDT (0100 GMT on Thursday) in West, a town of some 2,700 people about 80 miles south of Dallas and 20 miles north of Waco. All times listed below are CST, as per my location. I apologize if this causes any confusion. Town of West Evacuated, all injuries are now at area hospitals.  Fire and PD dealing with flareups, doing another House-by-House search. Many local assisting fire departments from neighboring counties have been cleared and sent back to their districts. Other anhydrous tanks on site are reported to be stable for the moment. The Rest Haven nursing home has been damaged. 150 survivors from the nursing home have been taken to the West community center.

**UPDATES** (Times in CDT)

**2:42** Eyewitnesses have reported a dark curtain of soot and dust covering the area

**2:47** @youranonnews: Fires at the plant are now under control and the threat of further explosion has been downgraded.

**2:53** The fertilizer plant where the explosion occurred was [cited for failing to obtain or to qualify for a permit in 2006.](http://www.khou.com/home/Fertilizer-plant-cited-for-06-permit-violation--203542181.html)

**BREAKING** The death toll is estimated to be between **5 and 15** at this stage.

Emergency crews will work their way through ""every individual home"" to check whether any casualties are inside. Police confirmed the smoke from the fire is not believed to be harmful. City officials will give further details on the latest situation at **10am** local time.

**5:01** **BREAKING/UNCONFIRMED** A spokesman for ambulance teams on scene told CBS that **two paramedics and six firefighters had been killed.** In addition

**Details**

***

Today is the fifth day of protesting in Istanbul and now

Yesterday (day four) upwards of 10

The police have been using tear gas, water cannons and charge tactics - Common crowd control methods, however usually only used when the crowd is violent or threatening. The crowd was none of which.

Mainstream media is not covering the events. Local media are afraid of being shut down by the government whilst international networks are using other stories to fill the gap and providing repeat pieces. There is no answer to why they are doing this.

The injury toll stands at 100+ whilst the death toll is at least 1. Amnesty International has called for a halt to the police brutality whilst  social media spreads the word of the Turks protest.

The [Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/politics/prism-collection-documents/)

Its as real as it gets. They have secured internal NSA training slides.

**REACTION:**

Former Clinton administration Chief Counselor for Privacy Peter Swire

Foreign governments are in uproar. The European Union in particular has rules about data protections for civilians and privacy rights

German Federal Data Protection Commissioner Peter Schaar wrote [a blog post](https://www.bfdi.bund.de/bfdi_forum/showthread.php?t=4233) (in German) on the issue. He notes that the NSA program bolsters the need for a strong EU data protection regime. The EU-US data treaty that has been in negotiation for a few years is [now in jeopardy](http://euobserver.com/justice/120412). 

Several privacy advocates have chimed in

The UK government is [cross-examining GCHQ involvement](http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2013/jun/07/prism-gchq-access-covert-operation) as it appear the UK also received some intel from PRISM.

The [companies involved flatly deny](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/07/prism-tech-giants-shock-nsa-data-mining) all knowledges at the executive level

The Washington Post began [expanding and hedging](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanhall/2013/06/07/washington-post-updates-hedges-on-initial-prism-report/) its article expecting a  legal / governmental shitstorm

A [media spin war](http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2013/06/07/the_prism_spin_war_has_begun) over what direct access means has begun.

Here is a [Raw Story breakdown](http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2013/06/08/prism-europe-reacts-to-u-s-surveillance-revelations-with-anger/) of world reaction.

Twitter appears to be the only major social media to [not be a part of the program](http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2013/06/07/nsa-prism-twitter/2401605/)

My updates aren't necessarily in chronological order in each section (because I am editing information about each fact to make it current as we learn more) but rather in the order of importance for someone just coming to the thread to read.  I apologize if that makes it difficult for people to see what has been recently added

This is a thread for discussion of the released photos of the pressure cooker remnants as shown [here (original leak)](http://www.myfoxatlanta.com/story/21996004/exclusive-photos-boston-marathon-bomb) and [here (higher res

Basically

[This is a different stamp](http://imageshack.us/a/img203/5258/stamp2b.jpg).  This is also [a different stamp.](http://imageshack.us/a/img221/9132/stamp3.jpg)

Please correct me if anything I say below is wrong!  I've tried to identify speculation where it occurs. 

------------------

**What We Know About The Mystery Cooker(s):**

* Verified that one bomb was a pressure cooker.  Looks to be the second bomb

* From the [Fox photos](http://www.myfoxatlanta.com/story/21996004/exclusive-photos-boston-marathon-bomb), shows the remains of FAGOR (a manufacturer) and that the imprint and [printed text](http://waga.images.worldnow.com/images/2424732_G.jpg) are identical to several models of FAGOR cookers (more below).

* A pressure cooker lid has been found on a nearby roof according to CNN's [""Breaking News""](http://www.cnn.com/?hpt=sitenav).  It is unclear from CNN's newsflash (accompanied by the photo of the mangled lid that we'd already seen) whether this is a NEW lid or they are just reporting where the FIRST lid (pictured) was found.  [AP is reporting](http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_BOSTON_MARATHON_EXPLOSIONS?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2013-04-17-03-10-06) that they were two pressure cookers

* WAS THE HANDLE REMOVED?  I believe so.  [The bolts with the square nuts in the photos of the cooker from the second bomb](http://images.derstandard.at/2013/04/17/1363808799782-bombe8.jpg) are [bolts](http://i.imgur.com/osUfQNZ.jpg) that are designed to go into the upper section of a [handle](http://i.imgur.com/9y3n1lR.jpg).  Look how far away they are from the bolt head in the intact cooker as compared to the ones in the crime scene photo (which look like they were snugged right up against the lid).  During explosions

* The two pressure ratings listed (.55/1.05 bar) means that it was a two-setting model and those pressures are its low/high settings.  The PS number (1.6 bar) is a safety value of the pressure it would take to warp the base of the cooker (thank you to our resident pressure cooker expert!)

* It was 6 liters in volume.

* The [inside of the lid](http://waga.images.worldnow.com/images/2424729_G.jpg) matches the inside lid of all FAGOR cooker models I have seen so far and does not appear to be of great use in identifying the model.  (The Chef may be different.) We do not have the silicone lid seal present and/or visible, we see that this valve is supposed to help pressure escape in excess conditions.  It makes sense that the culprit would try and plug this valve to build up as high a pressure as possible.

* A two-setting model is expensive (significantly more so than a one-setting model).  A detonation of this type should not require an expensive or very good pressure vessel (the walls would blow out regardless of a small hole or leak in the seal).  Speculation says that it is likely that the cooker(s) was purchased secondhand for cheap or already owned (either that or the culprit THOUGHT that a more expensive pressure cooker would perform better...)

---------------------

**What We Know About FAGOR Cooker Models:**

* From [FAGOR'S website](http://www.fagoramerica.com/cookware/pressure_cookers/rapid_express_line/rapid_express) we know that their current production line has only four two-setting models: the Duo, and the Chef.  We have seen Duos and Elites with identical printings and stamps on their bases, but I haven't seen a Chef yet.

* FAGOR changes base-imprints often in the same line.  It is difficult to tell from online photos and eBay how old the cookers are

* Splendids say Splendid on the handle.  Elites say FAGOR on the handle.  Unless, but might help identify your cooker if you don't have a manual/box.)

* Different models have different colour switches.  You can see the current line's colours on [FAGOR'S website](http://www.fagoramerica.com/cookware/pressure_cookers/rapid_express_line/rapid_express).  There also appears to be variation in the internal silicone gasket colour.

* /u/JohnnyP pointed out that though the handle halves lock together

--------------------
**Things That Would Be Useful To Know/Have:**

* Information on how the base imprints change over time in the same model line.  Did they change in a certain year?  Is it based on something else?  We can get this information primarily by crowdsourcing people's cookers, we are both trying to rule out and identify models as possibilities, so everything helps!

* Information on whether any of the current one-setting models used to be two setting or the two-setting models one setting.  For example, and it's because they were manufactured before July '11, as stated by [this Amazon replacement handle for ""Splendids and Old Elites""](http://www.amazon.com/Fagor-Old-Elite-Splendid-Handle/dp/B00581WF2M). 

* ""If someone has one of these similar [6L] models, that would also be great!

* Are those bolts with the square nuts hardware that is actually found in the FAGOR lids

-------------
**User-Submitted Photos and Information:**

*I will clean up this section tomorrow because I am tired now

TCanDaMan's FAGOR Elite 4L [imprint and pressure ratings](http://imgur.com/a/YBvAX#2XLPapK) as well as [lid-handle attachment](http://imgur.com/a/XdyfZ) seem to match that of the 6L pressure cooker in the evidence photos.  His was purchased at Macy's new at Christmas.  The Splendid also has a [virtually identical lid interior](http://i.ebayimg.com/t/Fagor-Pressure-Cooker-4pc-Set-Includes-4L-and-6L-Cookers-/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/tgAAAMXQLbVRa4J4/$T2eC16dHJFwFFZ8hL!tdBR, though the jury's out on whether or not there is a hyphen between Gas and Electric on the evidence photos. 

UPDATES AS I CONTINUE CHECKING OTHER MODELS TO MAKE SURE THESE ARE THE ONLY TWO POSSIBILITIES: [The Rapida in this Ebay auction](http://www.ebay.com/itm/New-Fagor-4-Quart-Pressure-Cooker-18-10-Stainless-Steel-/171004240128?pt=Small_Kitchen_Appliances_US&amp;hash=item27d0a5a100) appears to have the same imprint on the bottom but not the same format of listing the pressure ratings as the evidence photos.  Other Rapidas have different imprints.  Also not consistent.

[This 6L Duo](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Fagor-Duo-18-10-Stainless-Steel-6QT-Pressure-Cooker-Olla-de-Presion-Presto-/130876567802?pt=Small_Kitchen_Appliances_US&amp;hash=item1e78d9f0fa) has the same imprint and pressure rating format

[sixbluntsdeep's 6L Rapid Express](http://imgur.com/a/ToiAz) has the same imprint but only one pressure level on its base.

As stated before

I have said some pretty terrible things about you in my life.  I'm a Yankees fan.  A big one.  I'm sure you've said some pretty terrible things about me and my kind too.  What exists between our two cities is a fabled rivalry.  We scream and we cheer and we fight for our cities

I was there when you guys beat us and went on the break records and win the World Series for the first time since 1918.  To myself, I knew how much that meant.  As a Yankees fan, having seen my team win the World Series before, I couldn't even begin to fathom how amazing this must be for you, Boston fans, a first in most of your lifetimes.  I came to learn later that this was the opinion of a majority of Yankee fans.  We weren't happy.  Far from it.  But you are fans, long suffering

I was in New York on 9/11.  The fear, all of it is burned into my memory.  What happened yesterday, Boston, what happened to you and your city, and in the moments after and what will come to be the days and months and years after, it's not ok, and it’s not easy.  I'm not going to tell you that you will rise above and see the good in the people and your city

But here's what I do know.  Here's what I've learned from Red Sox fans and Yankees fans.  Boston and New York have this in common; we are strong, we love our cities.  We love our people.   You come to our town, and you try to break us?  F you.  We will mourn the losses and we will clean up our streets.  We will cry and we try to explain to our children why this happened.  But have no doubt, no one comes into our towns and breaks us.  

For 86 years, that your Red Sox were going to win the World Series.  You want to mess with that sort of passion?  I've watched you proudly march into our stadium with your Boston gear and cheer with definitive belief that you were champions with nothing more sometimes than faith and love for your city and your players.  These are the people of Boston.  

My heart hurts for you right now Boston.  But you know what?  There's this thought that keeps coming back to me.  I just keep thinking, but what I'm even more certain of is this city just got stronger.  And I didn't think that was possible.  My sports analogy might seem trite but if I have learned anything as a lifetime Yankees fan, it's that Boston will not take this lying down.  You are proud and you are strong.   Go Boston.  Go Sox.  Go Celtics.  Go Bruins.  Go Patriots.  I'm with you Boston.  We all are.  We are the same.  

Sincerely
Yankees fan

[opinion],,115,68,183,"This might be an incredibly dumb and unpopular opinion here on reddit and I understand if you think differently but I can't help but feel, and good kid. They say that they would have never ever thought that he could do something like this. In the videos at the marathon he's seen trailing behind his older brother, his brother more extremist feelings about America and recently had Jihadist ties. Apparently suspect #2 went back to class at the university on wednesday and attended school normally

Reading back on this it sounds  ridiculous but I can't help but feel like we're all jumping so hard for this. We're all cheering and happy that Boston is safe again. We all call him scum and if he knowingly put the bomb there

I apologize for this severely unpopular opinion but I just had to get it out there. Tell me what you guys think and feel free to completely shut me down and disprove my ideas. I'm also sorry for all of the gramatical errors and bad writing. I have no excuse except for the fact that I am a bad writer. 

My prayers go out to the families of the victims at the boston bombings. I hope the truth can come out. 

EDIT: The fucking backpack!! I just can't get over the fact that we really don't have hard evidence that THIS was the man who set it down. Yes
[When I look at the pictures of them with their backpacks on, and they sag at the bottom and are “tighter” at the top. Carrying a heavy backpack over one shoulder causes one to lean to the opposite direction for balance, especially for a skinny person like the younger. He does not look like he is compensating in that way.]

I don't know anything but I just have a bad feeling about this. Great answers everybody! I am seeing both sides. Sympathizing with the suspect because of his age is really stupid I think but the older brother dynamic is interesting.

I have some concerns.  Overall I don't believe that the new measures intended to increase security will be effective.  The new name badges and locked classroom doors would not have stopped the shooter in Sandy Hook.  But what they will do is scare our children and make the school feel like a prison.  
 
A quick look at crime statistics tells a different story then our 24 hour news cycle headlines:  ""In 1992 the violent crime rate per 100,000 to 1.4 per 1,000."" 
 
And, the rate on victimizations per 1,000 students for theft dropped from 101 to 18. For violent crimes, the rate dropped from 53 to 14. And for ""serious violent"" crimes, the rate dropped from 8 to 4.""

I met Issa Amro
(Proof of terrorist) http://blogs.jpost.com/content/fun-and-games-issa-amru-hebron, non-violent protestor. 

While in the area, he asked me to ask him questions, so I asked him 2.

1. Why did the people of the West Bank and Gaza elect Hamas?
(not verbatim, more homes are taken every day, and we do not have the simple freedom to move from place to place. A trip to Ramallah used to take 20 minutes. Now, that same trip takes 2-3 hours. There are 4 checkpoints on the way, where they can hold me up to three hours (at each), and it has taken me 10 hours to travel there. All in all, under their leadership, are great negotiators. Look at Gilad Shalit. They were able to take one captured soldier and exchange him for over 1000 captured patriots. While I do not agree with the methods they use

2. What is the resolution? A 2-state solution
There can be no 2-state solution, while I have guns continuously pointed at my head. Israelis live under civil law, we here in the West Bank live under Israeli Military law. I cannot negotiate when I have nothing. I am oppressed, and Israel is the oppressor. How can a person in a giant jail negotiate for their freedom. Until we are given our basic rights, like freedom of privacy, speech, movement, we can not begin to consider anything. (I, that contract is not legally enforceable.)

He spoke about much more, to systematically take control of the area (even though it is illegal under international law - a quick interesting read that explains the basics on both sides, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_West_Bank_barrier).

What an AMAZING day. There was SOO much more that I saw

Reports of 2 officers down as well as automatic gunfire.

Whatever our background, we shared a unique experience unprecedented in human history. There have been previous harbingers, as the internet vehicles commonly referred to as ""social media"" have become available to, and been adapted by, an increasing number of the world's population.

But this was different. We knew that we were making history, each time we ""hit reload,"" a new chapter in the story of human communication. We felt it, and even in the midst of mourning the tragedy that was its genesis, it was a high like no drug or extreme sport could give us.

The making of that history was inevitable. That this chapter was written by our keyboards is pure chance. We were in the right place at the right time. 

Each of us will apply the things we learned and thought and felt, to our own lives.

* **The Mirror** 

&gt;The FBI was last night hunting a 12-strong terrorist “sleeper cell” linked to the Boston marathon bomb brothers.

&gt;Police believe Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev were specially trained to carry out the devastating attack.

&gt;More than 1

&gt;A source close to the investigation said: “We have no doubt the brothers were not acting alone. The devices used to detonate the two bombs were highly sophisticated and not the kind of thing people learn from Google.

&gt;“They were too advanced. Someone gave the brothers the skills and it is now our job to find out just who they were. Agents think the sleeper cell has up to a dozen members and has been waiting several years for their day to come.”

&gt;A specialist team of CIA and FBI interrogators was yesterday flown to a Boston hospital to grill wounded Dzhokhar

At a press conference held Wednesday morning

Police say the father, was confronted by the child's grandmother regarding the baby's disappearance and the grandparents then went directly to the Oneida County District Attorney's Office. Wameling is not currently being charged, but police say he is being questioned.

Police say the Levon's mother checked into rehab for drug use around the time of the disappearance.

Utica Police along with New York State Police canine units have been searching the area around the 748 Jay Street apartment where the Wameling family lived

""Right now our goal is to find the kid

Jevon Wameling tells police that he isn't sure what happened to his child.

""He had a difficult time getting into his residence

Police are not currently treating Jevon as a suspect

""I can't say exactly what went on during the interview

Many outside services have been called to aid in the investigation such as Child Protective Services and the National Center for Missing Children.

Police say they will continue searching day and night until baby Levon is found.

http://www.cbc.ca/player/News/ID/2229371544/

&gt;April 22: 2 individuals charged under terrorism sections of criminal code

&gt;Target: via passenger train
&gt;Al-Qaeda supported attack

&gt;Investigation began August 2012

&gt;The suspects did not post an imminent threat

&gt;Worked with FBI

****
&gt;Police reiterate that there was no imminent threat (no bombs had been produced

&gt;Charges have been laid; terrorism related offenses.

&gt;Police stress that our resopnse to terrorism has to happen in our communities and in our homes. 
Keep your eyes open

&gt;Warrants executed in Montreal

&gt;Suspects: ages 30 and 35

&gt;Evidence of conspiracy to attack Via rail passenger rail train in Toronto

&gt;Took steps to initiate terrorist attack

&gt; Surveillance trains/rail systems in Toronto.

&gt; Toronto Police, CSIS, Via Rail and CN Police, + more, all supported investigation. 


&gt; Charges laid described as important. Suspects related to Al-Qaeda. Montreal was not a target. One suspect lived and worked in Montreal for a few years. 


&gt;Police monitored suspects closely enough that public safety was never in jeopardy. Police feel they have preemptively stopped the attack. 

* **Questions now being taken:**

&gt;Search warrants have been executed in the past hour.

&gt;At this time the investigation is ongoing. 

&gt;Two individuals are not Canadian citizens. 

&gt; Police will not discuss when the suspects came

&gt;Individuals were receiving support from AQ elements located in Iran. No indication that this plot was state sponsored. 

&gt; AQ elements in *IRAN*. Police state this again after reporter makes sure he heard correctly.

&gt;The support being received was in the form of direction and guidance. 

&gt;Suspects plotted to derail a train. A threat to the safety of people and infrastructure.

* **From the CBC:**

****
&gt;Canadian police say they have arrested two men and thwarted a plot to carry out a major terrorist attack on a Via passenger train in the Greater Toronto Area.

&gt;The two accused are Chiheb Esseghaier, and Raed Jaser, 35, from Toronto. They have been charged with conspiracy to carry out a terrorist attack and ""conspiring to murder persons unknownn for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with a terrorist group.""

&gt;The two men arrested are not Canadian citizens

&gt;The RCMP accuses the two men of conspiring to commit an ""al-Qaeda-supported"" attack.

&gt;Police said the two accused were getting ""direction and guidance"" from al-Qaeda elements in Iran. There was no information to suggest the attacks were state sponsored

I remember back when the Supreme Court announced their decision regarding Obama's health care bill, whatever. That's fine. Wasn't a big deal. Just made you a laughingstock for a good week or so.

But earlier today, you failed to do an adequate check. You heard from one source that the man was arrested and you, a mainstream news channel that is funded with millions of dollars to report the actual news, decided that one source was enough.

I wouldn't be mad if this was just another silly slip-up like your Obamacare mishap. But this time, you have some common courtesy for the people that have a very personal interest in seeing the perpetrator of this horrific crime brought to justice? Like how when the bomb first went off, you and other news channels were reporting that there were other bombs scattered all around Boston, which presumably sent people into a panic, and it turned out to (surprise!) not be true. How about instead of focusing on drumming up sensationalist headlines with flimsy sources, you focus on being a responsible news source?

I realize CNN can't go full investigative journalism 24 hours a day. That's unrealistic. They don't have the resources and no one would watch. But the balance has shifted way too far to the side of laziness and talking heads. You have a news story introduced

I'm reminded of a quote I heard awhile ago when I worked in the media.

There are some suggestions that the Tsarnaev's were present at robbery at a 7-11 which they did not commit.

During a Friday morning press conference

&gt; showed a security-video image from a 7-Eleven which, they had just been there around the time of a robbery [New Yorker article, paragraph 3](http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/closeread/2013/04/gunfire-in-cambridge-and-watertown.html).

According to this [Business insider article](http://www.businessinsider.com/boston-manhunt-dzhokar-tsarnaev-escape-fled-foot-marathon-bombings-2013-4)

&gt; In a crazy twist

This is a remarkable suggestion: the Tsarnaev brothers somehow blundered into an unrelated robbery.  Since the probably already knew that the FBI had put out fuzzy pictures of them

On the other hand

&gt; Chabris told Maclean’s that a 7-Eleven location at 750 Massachusetts Ave. in Cambridge did experience a robbery last night

&gt; “I’ve seen the picture of the guy who did rob a Cambridge 7-Eleven store last night at 10:30,” she said. “Not only that, the picture of the suspect that is on the news websites is taken from a store that is not ours.”

This (USA Today story)[http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/04/19/7-eleven-robbery-boston/2097915/] tells a similar story

&gt; The suspects were at the 7-Eleven around the time of the robbery but they did not rob the store said

Note that 750 Mass Ave in in Central Square, there's no way the Tsarnaev's could have shot Officer Collier at approximately 10:30 or earlier, which is what seems to be suggested [here](http://www.cambridgema.gov/cpd/Alerts/citizenalerts/policedainvestigatingfatalshooting.aspx).

So what's going on here? The best guess is just confusion: there was a robbery at a 7-11, and some police and  reporters have confused the events.  

But given the multiple suggestions that the Tsarnaevs were in the 7-11 at the time of the robbery

I see the potential for this sub to really become a useful source of breaking news info for 10s of thousands of people (as opposed to the other news subs which are really more geared for one post coverage rather than multiple update threads), which proves that a person has been a good participant in or poster of breaking news updates, so we don't have some situation where a person no one knows volunteers to take over a new post and then uses it to allow a witch hunt/etc to go on unchecked. Perhaps this has already been discussed by people who have subbed here longer than three days, but I wanted to bring it up, in case it hasn't?

First, as the government should not just hand out tax exempt status freely.  

Secondly, lobbying groups, and specific candidates, and it is improper to have a tax exempt group with a single beneficiary.

The IRS has a history of focusing audits and scrutiny on specific tax forms

It is my argument that groups with ""Tea Party"" or ""Patriot"" in the name are normally (somewhat radical) conservative groups.  These  groups have a clear anti-government and anti-tax agenda.  They are therefore obvious candidates to misuse the US Tax code

I don't find a significant news story out of this.  I read this as the IRS doing its job, including government, as a whole), and a simpler tax code.
