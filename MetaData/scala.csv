From the post:

**New Tumblr**

 * moved to JVM
 * Scala + Finagle + Redis

**Advantages of Scala**

 * access other JVM libraries
 * easier to assemble team than with Node.js
 * SBT : most developers don't have to get in the guts of the build system
 * easy concurrency (was actors; now mainly futures)
 * Scala apps perform fantastically

Since I'm not a Scala guru
My thought was to publish a site using github pages (jekyll powered) and add multiple collaborators to post tutorials and guides around Scala for various levels in a consistent place and style.

So if you like writing about Scala, please let me know what you think of http://scalatutorials.com (it's a bare bones Jekyll template using github pages with some tweeks around syntax highlighting etc, nothing more) 

One way I thought of doing it in collaboration is to fork 
https://github.com/scalatutorials/scalatutorials.github.io/
then add your post

(each author will get full credit and ability to link to their twitter / blog etc if they wish)

but I'm open to ideas. 

What do you think? Is a collaboratively edited tutorial site a good idea? do we even need another Scala tutorials site or what we have is good enough?

The game isn't incredibly mature. I mostly just have hacked together code for a rough idea of the game right now. One of the big things I need to do before the conversion is come up with some modeling of how everything should be represented and handled (the current setup is a mess).

**Is UML used for Scala? Is there something else or something more appropriate for Scala?**

Part of the reason I want to use Scala is for the functional programming support. I know a bit of theory from reading up on haskell and lisp

**What are the most useful functional concepts in Scala for a game? In general? Alternatively

I've been learning from a free light version of Cay Horstmann's Scala for the Impatient. I like it

**What're the best paid Scala resources? What're the best free Scala resources?**

EDIT: Added a bit to the functional concepts question.

EDIT 2: You guys have been excellent

**Why Should I use Scala?**

* Scala is an excellent Java replacement even if you ignore large sections of its FP features.

* There's some debate

* Still get all the Java libraries you need

**How can I learn Scala?**

* Martin Odersky's 1st Edition Programming in Scala is [free online](http://www.artima.com/pins1ed/index.html).

**How can I learn non-OP/FP game dev?**

* [This series](http://prog21.dadgum.com/23.html) is focused on much purer FP but shows classics game design examples done in FP

* Aside from what I've learned here

**What else do I need**

* Akka and Scalaxy (among others) seem to be highly recommended

* From just a little play

A lot of you have posted other links or more specific information.

I've started already. Finding it difficult not to just rattle of the Scaladoc specs. It should really help people new to Scala to appreciate why it's so awesome. I'm thinking sections on higher order functions, traits, typeclasses etc. 

Would love some help and proofreading.

    trait State {
      def pressSpace: State = this
      def releaseSpace: State = this
      def pressLeft: State = this
      def releaseLeft: State = this
      def pressRight: State = this
      def releaseRight: State = this
      // etc
    }

    trait CanJump extends State {
      override def pressSpace = Jumping
    }

    object Standing extends State with CanJump {
      override def pressRight = Moving
      override def pressLeft = Moving
    }

    object Moving extends State with CanJump {
      override def releaseRight = Standing
      override def releaseLeft = Standing
    }

    object Jumping extends State {
      override def releaseSpace = Standing
    }

The idea is that states can inherit and share some of their logic for handling inputs/events. It seems to execute as intended

I handled this with State's default implementations of event methods

Maybe it will hit page 3 soon (silly

My point is that SO is a great place to ask (and answer) noobish questions (that are not already there) to automatically create great FAQ. That is one thing that we can easily do to make Scala popular.
