1360717326.0,18ewf4,A lot of you are (rightfully) upset at the final product that is A:CM. Maybe I can shed some light as to how it got the way it is.,throwawayacm,973,161,698,"First off

Pecan (the internal codename for ACM) has a pretty long history. SEGA, long before Pecan had even started production. The game has been in active development in the past, only to be shelved in favor of another project (Borderlands, Duke, etc), and each time it was resumed it would undergo a major content overhaul.

SEGA, but GBX got away with it for a long time and the contract between SEGA and GBX kept getting augmented to push the projected release further and further back. The last time it was resumed, GBX outsourced a good portion of the game to outside companies. Initially, the plan was for TimeGate to take the majority of campaign, GBX would take MP, Demiurge and Nerve would handle DLC and various other focused tasks. This decision was made mostly so that most of the developers at GBX could continue working on Borderlands 2, while a small group of LDs

Somehow the schedules for Pecan and Borderlands 2 managed to line up and GBX realized that there was no fucking way they could cert and ship two titles at the same time. Additionally, Pecan was supposed to hit beta, but GBX instead came to an agreement with SEGA that they would push the release date back one more time, buying GBX around 9 mos extension.

About 5 of those 9 months went to shipping BL2. In that time, it became pretty apparent that what had been made was in a pretty horrid state. Campaign didn't make much sense, the boss fights weren't implemented, PS3 was way over memory, etcetcetc. GBX was pretty unhappy with TG's work, and some of Campaign maps were just completely redesigned from scratch. There were some last minute feature requests, most notably female marines

Considering that SEGA was pretty close to taking legal action against GBX, or shoved in (a good example of this are challenges, which are in an incredibly illogical order). Issues that didn't cause 100% blockers were generally ignored, with the exception of absolutely horrible problems. This isn't because GBX didn't care, mind you. At a certain point, they couldn't risk changing ANYTHING that might cause them to fail certification or break some other system. And so, the product you see is what you get.

Beyond gameplay, and so hopefully there will be DLC to flesh that out a bit better.

1. Engineers ""seed"" loads of planets

2. Engineers sit back and observe from afar. After many millions of years

3. But there is an unforeseen consequence on the first few planets they start clearing - once the mutated humans start procreating, like Shaw's ""baby"") **BUT THIS DIDN'T HAPPEN WITH THE WORMS ON LV223?** - yes - because the worms were too simplistic a life form to develop in that way. They evolved into angry murderous worms, with a natural instinct to ""impregnate"" Millford through his mouth - but without the necessary equipment to fertilise him.

4. Engineers are freaking out

5. While they are down there, with a load of egg samples collected from the planet he was investigating - only for a xenomorph to burst out of him. He crash lands on LV426 and his xenomorph offspring hangs around for a few years, but eventually dies of old age as there is no suitable prey on LV426 to sustain it. The eggs remain in his cargo bay until Nostromo arrives.

6. Meanwhile

7. Meanwhile in the confusion, the final one decapitated by the door. The others were *actually running from him*. They close the door just in time to save themselves. 

8. Locked in the head room, or this is what you get out of it.

9. The rest of the engineers are killed by their colleagues - only the angry pilot manages to get himself into hypersleep before it's too late.

10. Two thousand years later he is awakened by David and Weyland. He doesn't really understand what David is saying - after all, the last he heard was that they were all mutated into murderous beasts, contaminated with a biological clusterfuck of a weapon gone wrong. His only choice is to kill them before they mutate, or give birth, or whatever.

*SPOILERS GALORE BELOW THIS POINT*

So, and follows on from various interviews I've read with Ridley Scott talking about ""Chariot of the Gods"", the Erich Von Daniken book from the 70s about how humans are descended from a space faring race. 

Flash forward to the future and Weyland Tech is subsidising a trip to LV-223 to investigate what the star maps are pointing to. Clearly this is so that Weyland himself has one last roll of the dice to try and extend his life (one of the many Blade Runner references throughout: ""I want more life, as has Vickers' escape pod. They land, find the goo and get back to the ship just before the storm (awesome scene). This brings us to the bit that most people seem to struggle with, what is the black goo?

My take is that the goo is a catalyst for life, a killer, and the way it changes the host depends on how they are infected. Look at the evidence: Fifield is infected from direct contact with the goo, goes insane and is killed. Holloway is fed the goo by David (on the orders of Weyland) and becomes infected from within, after impregnating Shaw. She incubates the seed inside her and pulls it out as it's gestating. This then impregnates the last engineer in the standard Alien way (seed down throat) which creates the proto-xenomorph that we see at the end. So, the goo is a weapon and we have been seeded on Earth to be the hosts of that weapon, hence the reason that the engineers are sending the ship back full of it. 

I thought the subtext to the storyline was subtly brilliant in many ways. The main themes are to do with creation, what it means to be human. Taking creation first, the engineers created us and we created David. This sets up an ongoing theme throughout the film about what it is to be ""human"". There are many examples of this - the conversations David has with the crew, specifically Holloway, the exchange between Vickers and Janek when he ""just wants to know if she's a robot"".  Just like the replicants in Blade Runner, David is actually ""more human than human"", he shows more emotional depth than the rest of the crew- look at the way he stares reverentially at Weyland, how much ""more human"" are we than our creations? In many ways LV-223 is out Voight-Kampff

The mission Prometheus is on is also a quest for our parents, the aliens gestating inside the hosts) Prometheus is about fatherhood. This goes right down to the way the engineers look, they are huge, muscular, silent creatures, just as many children see their fathers . Fatherhood in Prometheus is about creating something in your image that becomes something else (just as the goo changes its host into something different) and in the end becomes a threat that has to be destroyed; “A king has his reign, and then he dies. It's inevitable.” Ridley Scott is saying, then god is dead. 

For me Prometheus shows Ridley Scott is still a wonderful sci-fi director. He picks up the big themes and creates films that entertain as much as they make you think. I think Prometheus will be looked back upon as a classic

In Alien, 2122, a mere 4 days.

In Aliens, and July 28th, 2179: when she and the survivors of the Colonial Marines mission to rescue the civilians at Hadley's Hope enter hypersleep again on board the Sulaco, approximately 21 days later.

Finally, and ends with her suicide 4 days later on August 12th, 2179.

All in all, yet damaged antihero in her epic fight against the Alien creature in all it's forms and across many warzones. 

I find this depressing, mildly claustrophobic, and supremely entertaining. The thought that the last month of her life, Ripley was more or less in hell, in a constant struggle for survival adds a very disturbing human tone to the character and a painful empathy to her story. Add to this the final scene in which despite her best efforts, death was still inevitable, only to be brought on by her own action in a selfless suicide, in my opinion.

---

From the *Aliens* commentary track:


&gt; *David Fincher did a really good job photographically and so on. I think it's really a well-made film, which is you have to make it your own. I just don't think you should make it your own at the expense of what people like, personally.*

&gt; *But everybody's gonna make their own decisions. I had to change some things and make it my own on my film. And I know that Ridley probably watched it and wasn't pleased with a lot of things. He probably wasn't pleased with the fact that he hadn't made it. But I think it's tough. It's tough to see somebody continue on something that you've started. But then you learn to just get over it because that's the nature of this business.*

&gt; *I think the trick to this type of film is you just take it utterly seriously. You don't step outside yourself and try to have fun with it and wink at the audience. You take it absolutely seriously and you don't give the audience a chance to question it. And if the actors can sell it

---

And here are his [parting words](http://i.imgur.com/HY9pFSu.jpg) from the commentary (literally the last thing he says):

&gt; *I think in terms of actual technique, which is really what filmmaking is all about. It's about the people, it's about the relationships...*

&gt; *Of course

2) Before Fifield and Millburn meet their fate, which then led to the pilot's chamber.
What life form was the pup reading? Janick tells the boys that it must be a glitch cause the pup does it more than once, the pup is picking up the last Engineer's very faint, but still beating heart that's been asleep for two-thousand years, or could it be picking up the life form that destroyed all the engineers, the thing that burst from their chest and through the cryo-sleep-chamber glass?

Bonus! 3) Maybe the worms that are already found in the ""head"" room had something to do with what ultimately killed all the engineers? Ford's character remarks how the engineer's head is in a fascinating state of preservation. Perhaps the meal-worms were some how kept from further mutating by being in that sealed off room?

It's a stretch, if the engineers had successfully sent that ship down to earth, I think humans wouldn't know what they had on their hands and like the Prometheus crew, would want to explore and take various urns out of the ship. If for some reason the planet is inhabited by a bunch of Shaws; who don't want to touch anything then the meal-worms are there as a just in case measure. The atmosphere in the room gets fucked with, the worms start coming up to the surface and the urns start melting. Perfect security alarm really.

The Special Edition has multiple scenes which weren't included in the original theatrical cut, early on in the film, there's a sequence set on the colony, ""Hadley's Hope"", before the xenomorph infestation and the discovery of the Derelict. Although this sequence is initially interesting, with subsequent viewings, I've found it weakens the film overall by removing some of the suspense elements. Of course we *know* it's the xenomorphs that have caused the loss in communications, the acid burns

So my recommendation is that when you're watching the Aliens: Special Edition

The Aliens physical characteristics have been fluid over time in the Alien universe

Its first appearance can be seen as its classic interpretation. Black and silver

The intelligence is never truly investigated but it seems to be smart enough to navigate the Nostromo and also hide in the Narcissus. When hiding in the escape pod it seems to slowing and hibernating as it has to be forced out of its hiding place. This hints at a short violent life

The life cycle of Aliens fleshed out with the Queen and also its remoteness from the derelict as a location seem to position the alien as a fully evolved life form rather than weapon

The appearance of the Alien is in some ways more human with the less slender body but less human hands and feet. This can simply been seen as artistic license or an evolution of the Alien.

Alien 3 has a major departure from the classic look of the Alien. It removes the back pipes

Alien Resurrection shows the Alien is capable of higher though when a team of them sacrifice the weakest to burn a hole out of their pen on the Auriga. They are shown to be smarted than the crude conditioning that the scientists try to implement with cooling shocks. Another emotion shown is fear when weakest Alien is killed – it visible shies away from the others and hisses in defence.

Resurrection keeps the 3 hinged leg of Alien3 even though there is nothing left of the dog based biology of the Alien. The monsters of this film are drived from the queen embryo in Riply's blood sample from 3. While this is at odds with the creatures earlier appearance it could explain the more biological and slimy rather than wet look of the Alien

The two AvP films (Canon or not) do not really add to any discussion – the first cannot even contain a single design with animatronic and electronic rendered aliens having different leg designs. AvP:R shows categorically that a human host is not needed and that the Aliens life cycle could be determined by that of its host in some way. The “Predalien” laying multiple eggs orally itself with out the need for an egg or face hugger.

Prometheus I will not even discuss as the ALien has not yet been seen and is so open to interpretation. It seems clear that this is an artificial life form,,False,self,t5_2s5sk,False,,True

**The Ampule:** 

- *(pg 111)*: ""The Ampules the crew discover inside the Chamber turn out to contain a biological weapon created by the Engineers to eradicate life on Earth but which

- *(pg 126)*: ""The Hammerpede evolves from the black slime released from the Ampules inside the Pyramid when the temperature rises.""

**Head Statue:** 

- *(pg111)*: ""Ridley looked at it &amp; said, playing the role of god in the universe, have visited Earth many times over millenia and given mankind genetic upgrades both physically and intellectual. How would they celebrate themselves? So we came up with the idea of the giant head.""

**Ampule Chamber:**

- (pg 106)*: ""The brief from Ridley was a cathedral, with the Creation, Armageddon and Judgement cycle,"" says Max of the idea behind the cavernous Ampule Chamber. ""And there would be an altar of some kind, without it being recognizably affiliated with any known religion, but have the basic feel of a ceremonial space.

- *(pg116)*: Inside the Pyramid, with as its centerpiece, an arch-shaped relief of a pointy-head Giger-esque creature, which appears to have been crucified. ""That's the DNA homage to the ALIEN Giger creature, ""says Max, ""it's kind of a homage to him. They look at it &amp; speculate briefly about it. But it's not very clear what it is.""

**The Deacon:**

- *(pg 186)*: ""The offspring of the Trilobite's impregnation of the Engineer, which impregnated the Engineer, which then mixed its DNA with the Trilobite."" ""We tried to hold on to some of Shaw, some femininity. It was born of a female before being born of a male.""

**The Pyramid:**

- *(pg 96):* ""Since the creators of the Pyramid, Max felt the interior should reflect that. ""The assumption was that the creatures that we developed hearkened to a strand of intellectual life that came from them, &amp; so there should be smiliarities, that you should recognize in their culture some of ours. If they're going to be portrayed as our creators, then rather than some made-up forms, the audience should be able to recognize architecture derived from classical and ancient cultures on Earth.""

- *(pg 102):* ""Max's premise was that the Pyramid could harness sunlight as well as act as a condensor to create water. ""The major ingredients for life. That's why they could take their helmets off &amp; breathe

**Dawn of Time:**

- *(pg 28):* And so the movie opens with the arrival of a massive spacecraft bearing a towering race of human-like beings, then begins to disintigrate, his remains blowing into the sea and, eventually, mankind itself.""


**The Planet:**

- *(pg 67):*His concept was you don't really know there's architecture there until you get right in amongst it. And from a high altitude, there's this moment of realization that this is built.""

1339720889.0,v2man,Prometheus in the light of the earlier leaked script,ixid,45,3,62,"[This script](http://www.prometheus-movie.com/uploads/leaked_script.txt) was leaked three months before the film came out. It's interesting seeing the DNA of the final script in this one

Summary as I read through:

There's an incredibly cheesy just missing the mountain bigger than Everest with the ship sequence

It's established that the moon is somehow messing with the ship's systems hence their unawareness of the approaching storm and night.

Ship to team communications are jammed when the group first goes to explore the dome cave.

Shaw's the first to remove her helmet rather than Holloway

Fifield is actually interested in having found alien things.

""SHAW
We found evidence of extraterrestrial existence. Everything I’ve been led to believe was a lie""

Extra-terrestrial life causes Shaw to question her faith in some kind of meaningful way (why did they go through this script with a retard hammer removing all of this?).

This script is clearly an 18-cert oriented script that lacks all of Paradise Lost and Space Jesus stuff. I suspect it might have been edited after being leaked as Holloway seems to rape a virgin (rather than sterile) Shaw but nothing more is said about it and Shaw is directly implied to get raped by an alien med-pod's bio-mechanical tentacles

Janek's suicide by flying the ship into the flying derelict makes way more sense- no one else is on board and he's been shot four times by Vickers.

Vickers is an android.

The script is better on the basic story and character interactions level but lacks any interesting themes.",self,t5_2s5sk,1339730610.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/LV426/comments/v2man/prometheus_in_the_light_of_the_earlier_leaked/

* Most notably, 12 years after the normally accepted dating of Alien. The flight history of nearly every crew member also shows missions as recent as 2133.

* Ripley's [birth date](http://imgur.com/wlp4K) is given as 6/10/03

Should this information not be taken as canonical, would let such obvious discontinuities appear in the same film as the only one in the entire series that actually mentions a date. These dossiers are not just heaping piles of jargon either, they appear to have been meticulously constructed. They contain some nice character information too (If it's to be taken as canonical):

* Ash's flight history is strictly classified

* The rest of the human crew

* Possibly

* Lambet had a sex change at birth (Nothing too important

They quote him as saying (paraphrased) that the mural in the goo room shows a human being sacrificed to evolution

The idea I took from that is that the engineers goal is not to create humans, including maybe to some extent intelligence, and the engineers wanted the best base stock they could get for making the best xenos. This would be them, but of course they don't want to kill themselves, so they made humans in their image, i.e. with their same DNA, so that they could serve as the stock for the xenos. They then left us to develop ourselves, and reproduce to the point that there was enough of us to be sufficient stock for making enough xenos. Then they were going to come and drop their goo on us so that they could harvest their large planet sized crop of xenos.

I think this is reinforced by the mural depicting the xenos in a way that seems to show reverence. It also plays in nicely I think with some of the dialogue regarding the reasons for creation
 
TLDR: The end goal of the creation of humans was just to serve as a stock

In the AvP movies we see the predators intentionally spread xenomorphs for the hunt, whether they are one of their creations or not. What's interesting is that for a species that values the warrior so highly, they've attained (or have been given) advanced instruments that seem to be beyond their means.

It also gives us an idea of how long xenomorphs have been around, we have yet to see predators in a future setting, perhaps tying to the theories of creation and destruction behind the engineers.

Given that pretty much most of the major people associated with it are presumably busy with upcoming projects (Scott and Blade Runner 2 and a multitude of other stuff, though), do you think that they will still want to make it when it is years down the road and they finally have time to dedicate to it?

I'm sure most fans have seen it twice (or more) and it's one of those films where it really pays off. I watched ALIEN a couple of days ago as a ""refresh""

I admit I was a bit disappointed with Prometheus and this second viewing didn't change some things:

* Scientists that don't act like scientists
* Geologist and Biologist behavior (getting lost after mapping
* Not a lot of character development (I still don't care about most people that die)
* Silly way for Meredith Vickers to die

The positives:

* It was a lot easier to appreciate the visuals this time
* Noomi Rapace was indeed a good choice. Her character deserved a bit more insight that a mere ""dream sequence""
* David is a fantastic character he show and Fassbender does an amazing job. I wish we'd seen more of him and his origin.

As for character development, watched it several times, nostalgia?) I feel closer to the characters in the Nostromo. The claustrophobic environment of the ship also helped setting the mood.

I have a favour to ask of you

We are trying to capture people’s memories of watching Ridley Scott's classic Alien, but it got turned down.  That happens.  But what really grated was one referee’s comment, that Alien simply wasn’t worth spending time studying. What we’re doing now is a version stripped down to what could be managed without funding support.

What do we hope to learn?  A great many things, and how do their choices connect to what they see as its most salient features?  (2) how do men and women compare in their responses to the film – a question made particularly interesting by the ways in which Alien has featured as an exemplar within feminist film theory?  (3) how does age – and also age in relation to when the film was first seen – affect people’s responses?  (4) what changes about people’s perceptions of the film when they watch it repeatedly?  (5) How do people’s responses to Alien relate to their general sense of connection with film and cinema?  This is a small sample of what we believe we will be able to learn, providing we get a sufficient number and range of responses to fill all the various categories.  And that’s the key.

I can only give my opinion of what I saw and people can either add to it or disagree but this is how I saw the whole story of the movie.

The ""engineer"" at the beginning of the film is part of a renegade part of the space jokey species. While most of the species is trying to create a weapon capable of wiping all life off a planet

Why would the engineers make a map to the military installation?

I don't think they were intending it to be a map for human's to follow so much as a simple diagram of ""this is where you come from"" to answer the most basic question of the movie

Fast forward to roughly 2000 BC and the main space jockeys have discovered what their ""Prometheus"" brothers have done to earth and decide to use the weaponized black ooze to destroy earth's complex life. In the process of preparation for take off the ooze leaks and infects most of the crew. When the crew of the Prometheus arrive we only see the husks of what their bodies from where xenomorph's would have emerged.

This is another important part of the movie for me. The ooze mutates complex life into a xenomoprh parasitic and hyper aggressive species that requires a host to reproduce. If you think about it


Rest of the movie is clear from there on. I am with the crowd that thinks that Vickers was a fully functioning android who was programmed to believe she was human

Some have suggested that the proto-xenomorph that we see at the end of the film is some early version of the xenomorph form Alien on. I say it is not because it is a contaminated version of the xenomorph line that has been splice by human dna first. I would postulate that the traditional xenomorph is what would actual burst from an engineer if they are directly exposed to the black ooze with out the filter process

How does this explain why there was a derelict ship on LV426 that clearly had a queen and clearly she was born out of a space jockey. The installation on LV223 (if that was the number I forget) is roughly 2000 years old. But that is the age of the installation they were not aware of the deep ship when they did their dating

Some have gotten angry that the planet of LV223 was moderately hospitable to life but LV426 needed to be terraformed. LV223 was being terraformed by the engineers

Lastly I don't think that there is a third race. The ""larger"" race where the head design comes from in the cargo hold. I think that just like humans the engineers didn't know their god or who created them so they assumed like humans do that god looks like they do so they worship that form.

And maybe Earth is one of the locations - or the only one - that, resulted in the creators themselves. We're the successful experiment. We're their children, in the grandiose sense of the word.

I've always been a fan of Alien and Aliens and prior to the release of Prometheus picked up a copy of ""The Book of Alien"" by Paul Scanlon and Michael Gross. (My apologies if someone else has pointed this out before).

It's an interesting book that goes into some of the concepts and artwork from Alien.

To get to the point

The original concept idea was for the crew after discovering the Alien ship and ""space jockey"" was to then discover a huge pyramid after a dust storm. The idea was for the crew to come upon the Pyramid/giant tomb like ""place of worship.""

From that point a crew member was to be lowered into the tomb and find ""weird statutes and some sort of hieroglyphics (which later prove to be representative of Alien reproductive cycles)."" I wish I could show it (but as a future lawyer/kind of still believe in copyright-sorry). Giger game up with concept art to show the Alien cycle and it is very close to what you see in Prometheus.

Anyways

I guess I wanted to write this in defense of Prometheus. I think many of us have intertwined all of the ideas and story lines for the Aliens universe and created our own backstories and future ideas.

When I was a kid I watched this on vhs so much it wore the damn tape out and finally broke. I never had laserdisc so I didnt get to see the deleted scenes until a friend of mine at my first job was nice enough to make a vhs copy from his laserdisc.

Anyway

VHS: Everything is pretty solid and calm right up until Burke pulls his bullshit and tries to get Newt/Ripley impregnated. The two facehuggers die and shortly thereafter the aliens assault operations/medical.

Laserdisc/Blu Ray/Directors Cut: The Aliens are trying to get past the sentry guns

My question is this

If version 2

If going by version 1

When I was a kid and I watched the shit out of this movie

I used to think at first Apone burning the chestbuster earlier in the movie

Is my logic flawed?

This has really bothered me that I don't see anyone else writing about it...
the engineer at the beginning was ""pure"" hyper-muscled super-human etc.

the ""awoken"" engineer had geiger-esque skin and was mostly black. his eyes where also different. At first i thought it was a suit or something

it could be a few things...

maybe there are two factions of engineers? good and evil?
maybe the good ones created us

also with all the ties into ancient civilizations

anyway. just wanted to vent a little. I loved the film.

**Story:** as stated above the story makes no sense at all and is littered with plot holes and conflicts with the movie ""Aliens"" and I don't mean little stuff, along with the atmospheric processor, wait one minute here wasn't that area vaporized at the end of ""Aliens""? (i can't find the video for some reason) Oh yeah it was, so how come both the processor and Hadley's Hope managed to live? Another plot hole is how Bishops legs are still in the hanger when they were thrown into space like any other loose object in the hanger. The story is terrible with plot holes or without them.

**Game-play:** Honestly the worst part of the game for me, why the fuck does armor exist if its going to be drained so damn fast, it feels as if the armor is made of wet paper, and the weapons are bland and ammo is literally everywhere so you can spray and pray all you want basically. the only ammo that is sparse would be Hudson's pulse rifle, ammo doesn't really spawn until the last level to my knowledge.

**Multiplayer:** I played one match of team deathmatch and overall the multiplayer is decent at best

**Overall:** This game is a flaming bag of dog shit on a porch, and I hope any publisher in the future avoids asking Gearbox if they want to make a game, as they clearly shown they can't handle the responsibility to do so.",Misc,False,self,t5_2s5sk,,http://www.reddit.com/r/LV426/comments/1an08x/just_finished_aliens_colonial_marines_my_thoughts/
