* The first few episodes deal with the two of them coming to terms with their relationship starting, your girlfriend can cook.)...

* The next mini-arc deals with them getting established a bit more. There's the official-meet-the-parents dinner, her staying over at his place for a few days (a significant step), culminating in the Valentine's Day moment where she accepts him permamently into her home. 

* Target/Hunt then step it up another level, placing his needs above hers. Symbolically, she's waiting at home with Martha when they come back, as one big family unit when they re-unite. And she scolds him not for going to Paris but doing it without her. The contrast of signifance here is with 'Cops and Robbers' in season 4 where she was on the outside watching in as the Castle family reunited. This time she's on the inside with them. 

* After this, she comes over after work even if he was at home writing...she spends at least most of the week there. Unofficially living together by this stage. She also stages his best b'day present ever, showing that she knows him so well, so much better than anyone else ever has. 

* Culminating in the Big Moment of Still where she admits she loves him

* OK, they haven't actually sat down and defined the relationship and talked about where they're going. For two people of their ages, with significant baggage (children, ex-wives, committment issues etc) that's both understandable AND something they have to deal with as adults. The jarring part of the episode is NOT that Beckett wants to discuss a sense of their future together, but the mild flirting with Vaughn. 

* Beckett not talking to Castle about the job offer...yeah that's dumb, for example, where she felt she had to lie to Castle. But she struggled through it, and they came out for the stronger. I hope the same happens in the finale. I honestly DON'T WANT her to choose between Castle and her career. I hope they can write a scenario where they stay together and Beckett advances somehow.

But I've recently been doing a bit of a Castle marathon and I realized something: **Always was the first near death experience when Castle and Beckett weren't together**.

As far as I can think they've always been together when one of them was at risk of dying. Apartment shootout in season one; apartment bombing in season two; freezing to death in season 3; dirty bomb in season three; tiger in season 4; near execution by agents in season 4.

So what struck Kate during her apartment dangling in the finale was that Castle is always there with her. Except this time.

The missus and I started watching Castle 2 months or so back and we are on Season 3 right now. The episode we watched tonight was especially great because the missus is an X-Files fan and I am a Firefly fan. 

1) The moment of the security guards hand lamp shining just like they all do in the X-Files. We pointed that out before we knew the episode was going to be sci-fi inspired. The lamp light must just be that iconic.

2) Where Castle whistles the theme tune to the X-Files we both tried whistling it until smiling prevented anything more than just a single note sounding.

3) Bishop was in this one :) It's definitely a great sci-fi episode when you've got a guy from The Terminator and Aliens.

4) Castle talks like William Shatner in the car right before they get abducted. Maybe. It. Was. A. Bit. Too. Subtle. But. We. Thought. it was. Funny. 

5) Castle speaks Chinese

6) At the end when they both walk away in the darkness and Becketts hair looks a bit redder in the light (Scully reference?) the episode ends with this frame that took several attempts capturing. http://i.imgur.com/eNwn2kX.jpg

1337833729.0,u29ka,Predictions for whats ahead,wild9,21,7,22,"Ok, I wanna discuss what's up next! I’d be willing to bet money on some of these

* First off! Beckett will be back on the force no later than the mid-season break. Being a detective is as much a part of Beckett's identity as Batman is to Bruce Wayne's (I know, including myself, would argue that Bruce is more a part of Batman's identity than the other way around, but I'm keeping the simile as simple as possible). Now, resigning from the force was an important step for Beckett as a character, it showed she had finally let go and was willing to be happy. But being a detective hasn't been solely due to her mother's murder for a while now, she is the one to ""give a voice to the victims"". There's a reason she said that she resigned as opposed to just saying she quit. And from a purely technical point, so I think the earliest that she will be back on the force is about four to six episodes in
* Now the question is, which brings me to my next point...
* Castle is about to become obsessed with Beckett's case. He's spent four seasons passively working on it, and once it becomes clear that Beckett isn't free from her detractors, he's going to jump in headfirst to put an end to it. Beckett’s shooter is going to take advantage of this and go after Castle, going off the fact that Smith’s files would have a big ass picture of Castle and he’d probably find out he’s who Smith’s contact has been. This is big, Castle has never been targeted in the series. Sure, he’s been in dangerous spots plenty of times before, but no bad guy has set off with the express intent of doing Castle in. Castle will be captured to draw Beckett out into the open and she’ll return to the force to save him.
* Beckett is about to have a kick ass season. Let’s face it, tiger maulings, and ptsd to make it even worse. Beckett’s been through shit, and she’s just now at the most vulnerable point she’s ever been throughout the series, both emotionally and physically. She tore down emotional barriers that she had protected herself with and the one thing keeping her would-be killers at bay has now been torn down as well. She’s going to be tested throughout the season, but the show can either reward her by the end of it or punish her for letting her guard down, and so help me
* Beckett will start paying back Castle for all that he’s done for her. A) If you go off of major story arcs (the one’s that last more than one episode), there’s red in Beckett’s ledger, and she’s about to start paying it off. Not that the characters take the inequity between the two any seriously, but it’s important that Beckett get back to an equal footing. This will play out over the course of the rest of the series.
* Here’s where I get less sure: Beckett’s shooter will be the main antagonist for the first part of the season, but if it starts on the first episode of the season, I don’t know how it won’t be resolved by the third episode at the latest, and I don’t know how they could take a break for a few episodes in between then. This throws off my whole timeline, it’s kind of frustrating, and I’d love to hear your theories.
* The story arc of Beckett’s mother’s murder will be ended by the season’s end, and it was confirmed for me when the CIA girl said something about it before getting shot (I was pretty proud of myself for calling this at the start of season three). This arc will play out till the end of the series, so about two, *maybe* three seasons. I’m not sure yet whether Castle’s father will be good or bad. I’m leaning towards him being a bad guy, it would give plenty of material to send Castle into a tailspin as he uncovers all the bad that his father has done, and give him the chance to grow as the show comes to an end. But I could see him being a good-guy and in need of saving as well.

Now

* The big story arc in the middle of the season will feature a mad scientist about to release a biological weapon on the city. I want to say it’ll be a toxin that he puts in the water system. We’ve had the FBI, so I’ll put money on the NSA coming into play on this one. Now, none of what I’ve said has been too particularly amazing, but what pushes this arc from merely awesome to legen... wait for it... dary, is Dr. Horrible himself makes the cameo as the evil scientist. Yes, Nathan Fillion and NPH go head-to-head once again, with the fate of the city at stake. Neil Patrick Harris throws his dramatic weight around and we get an amazing mid-season story. Bam.

Also as i remember Castle doesnt know who his dad is and if im right according to the show his mom doesnt either. But his dad was brought up three that i can think of. 1. When his daughter asked him about it and he said he didnt know. 2. When the Spy dressed as CIA mentioned his dad just before she got shot. and 3. His ex quickly mentioned it when talking to Beckett. So my im wondering will Beckett ask or dig into who his dad is or talk about it.

1371337931.0,1gfakr,[Spoilers up to S4E20] My Perspective on Castle with Incomplete Knowledge,smeltofelderberries,7,2,12,"So

I love Nathan Filion as Castle. His gradual transformation from playboy to a more mature but still playful person has been gratifying. Beckett is a great character and Katic's portrayal of PTSD after Beckett got shot was very good.

The overarching plots, which right now is in lurch because Castle saw Beckett saw that she remembered her getting shot. I can't stop watching now because it is SO GODDAMN INFURIATING that they keep playing phone tag about their relationship.

The chemistry of the team is also a selling point for this show. The characters are more distinct than I'm used to with police shows. I'm glad that characters like Ryan have their own little arcs

The Beckett conspiracy is also intriguing and NEEDS TO BE FLESHED OUT MORE (no spoilers please). The mysterious figure in the garage

Overall

EDIT: FUCK THIS LIMEY FOR STEALING BECKETT. SHE DESERVES CASTLE. AND HE JUST NEEDS TO TALK TO HER.

EDIT TWO: HOLY SHIT CASTLE IN A BAR FIGHT. SLAUGHTER IS AMAZING.

EDIT THREE: SLAUGHTER IS NOT A GOOD DUDE. BAD SLAUGHTER. BAD. I DON'T WANT BECKETT TO GET FIRED. OH JESUS HOLD ME.

&gt;I'm a huge fan of this show, I never really thought much about the two of them falling in love. The writers started moving that direction and as it went, I went with them on it. This entire season has been nothing but a mess of ridiculously perfect moments that should have resulted in something!
This episode was the worst yet! I'm all for drawing it out. Stringing it to where that final moment when the spark ignites... the audience is screaming with them! But COME ON! You set this entire scenario up... Josh is leaving, they almost die... literally DIE together TWICE in one episode and NOTHING? He loves her... she almost said she loves him... and then you end it like that?
It's completely unbelievable. People don't act that way? Hell
If something doesn't happen now, it's just plain unbelievable and will destroy the rest that the show has going for it. [[source]](http://www.hulu.com/castle?forums=1&amp;post_id=1037519&amp;topic_id=255113)

1) Castle and Becket should have gotten together a long time ago. Surely no one in real life flirts like that for 4 years? They dragged it out for too long and by the time they did get together I didn't really care.

2) They should have wrapped up the whole Becket's mum murder plot a long time ago. Like the relationship they've dragged it out and it's become stupid. Does anyone still watching actually care who's behind this plot now

They should have had at least one of these sewn up by the end of the second season

3) Did Lainie actually study to become a doctor or did she just watch a few episodes of CSI:Miami? Some of her diagnoses are impossibly accurate.

4) Alexis is somehow the most mature 18 year old I've ever seen yet also the most whingey. She somehow spots flaws in ME reports despite never going to medical school yet spends episodes crying because she's growing up and is going to college. 

5) The format has become stale. A basic episode goes like this. 1) Scene of Castle at home with family

6) I don't really like Captain Gates

We cut to Beckett's office in DC with her playing with her hands, at the behest of Jenny and their new child, they push her away due to their own lives and their feelings on how he caused a rift in the team. When she tries to find comfort in Castles arms she learns that he has not returned since the day after he left for DC. When she asks Martha

Beckett heartbroken then returns to the hotel and is greeted by her new DC team and they begin the breakdown of what they are there to investigate. This fades to Ryan who is deep in paperwork being greeted by Esposito, with Beckett giving the rundown of what the Attorney General knows with Ryan and Esposito doing the same with their respective departments. Esposito explains to Ryan that he was ""promoted"" to liaison due to his behavior as an investigator in the military and his laissez faire attitude when it came to the soldiers. As they try to peace together what the motives for the disappearance are they see a heavily cloaked man with a beard at the scene and begin to walk toward him. He then makes a desperate sprint which ends with Beckett tackling him on the ground. To her surprise when she turns him around it's Castle. 

Castle, to the surprise of the rest of the gang. He then recants and spews an inane theory about alien abductions and government coverups. Esposito then makes a crack about government secrets. The crew then begin to to pack up when both Esposito and Beckett try to reach into their desks only to realize that they don't work there anymore. Castle calls shotgun with Esposito and the two ride off. 

A cut then has Beckett and Ryan discussing the rift in the team caused by Beckett and why she hasn't responded to Castle, unbeknownst to Castle, but lies to Castle anyway. The two then begin to reconnect when Espo discovers the victims body. 

They CSU begins sweeping over the area with Beckett and Castle standing near each other but not speaking.  While evidence is being processed Pearlmutter begins making cracks at Castle, we see the spark of realization in their eyes and soon they have cracked the case. They begin to weave the tale one after another, rekindling their lost magic and then they storm off to the perpetrators location. Beckett then bursts in and begins grilling her victim, with the tenacity of a caged honey badger, she begins to slowly break him down until he squeaks he needs a lawyer.

Kate then thanks the old team stating that she needs to return to DC and that she appreciates their help. Castle then asks her out on a date and she declines stating that she will see him one day. A cut then shows her on a plane sitting with her team when she pulls out a necklace and begins to play with it revealing that there are two rings on it. A cut then takes her to her boss's office when he reveals to her that their is a new branch being opened up in New York and that she is going to be transferred there. She is reminded that she is self autonomous and that she will be given assignments relating to that area. She is told she may have a partner and is told to play nice with the other agencies there.

Nowadays Castle is more or less just there for quick wit. In the past this might've been passable since I'm sure for a lot of fans the main draw was the developing will-they-won't-they relationship brewing between Castle and Beckett but now that they're together...well, in which the case at hand was resolved first by a legendary russian merc, and then secondly, an aging CIA agent. All Castle did was go Jack Bauer on some guy who'd been shot.
