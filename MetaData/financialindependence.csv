My life after early retirement:

... years ago I watched a fantastic TED talk given by Stefan Sagmeister called The Power of Time Off. Stefan owns a design studio in New York. Every seven years Stefan chooses to shut down his firm for one whole year. He uses this time to rejuvenate and recharge

There was one part of Stefan’s talk in particular that I thought would be very valuable for my life after early retirement. Stefan’s first year off started as a bit of a disaster. His plan was to leave a huge void of time

To eliminate this problem he sat down and made a list of the things he was interested in and created a schedule

Although not specifically used for financial independence I thought it was a fantastic idea! It’s an idea that would be prefect for my own life after early retirement.

In my life after early retirement I want to challenge myself to learn new things. I want to be there for my family and my community. I want to stay healthy by exercising daily. I want to learn how to cook new and delicious meals. For me

I've had a good deal of financial independence for well over a decade. The first few years were pretty easy. There was a good chunk of money set aside

Then I got married and had a child.

Actually, at least not to any significant degree. The problem was getting sucked in to helping my in-laws with their family businesses.

My in-laws are pretty conservative types but also quite well-off and well-connected. They couldn't understand why I was always home and didn't seem to be actually working. Money ""coming from the internet"" just wasn't in their sphere of comfort. To them, for a number of reasons, I felt compelled to help out in their various family start-ups. Yes, that's *start-ups* plural. Most of you can probably see where this is going.

My father-in-law put me in key positions in the businesses. At first, while I had huge responsibility, I had no authority at all. Virtually all decisions, both macro and micro, had to be run by him. My father-in-law, you see, is a powerful man

1359998860.0,17vj1p,Crucially important but never talked about in FI: Disability Insurance,OracleDBA,62,12,46,"The topic of disability insurance

**What is it:** Disability insurance is essentially insurance on your income.  For most of us in the wealth accumulation phase, you are out a million bucks.

**Why we need it:**  Disability is more common than you think.  The Insurance Information Institute in New York estimated in 2009 that 43 percent of 40-year-olds will have an incident causing long-term disability -- defined as lasting 90 days or more -- by the time they turn 65. [source](https://origin.bankrate.com/finance/insurance/disability-primer-obtaining-full-coverage-1.aspx). 

**Why ""group disability insurance"" sucks:**  Unlike car insurance where your car is either wreaked or not, you *are not considered disabled*.  This is just one example of how coverage varies.  Some terms that denote a strong disability insurance contract are:

* own-occupation definition: this means that if your disability prevents you from doing you main line of work (IT in the example above) then you can be deemed disabled and get your money

* non-cancellable: this means that if the insurer finds out that you got AIDS or inflation in the country spikes to 20%

**Downside:**  A good disability policy is expensive.  I pay about 1.5% of my salary for my premium.  The application process is long; I had to do a blood test

**Recommended action:**   Based on the above, Mass Mutual, The Standard, MetLife, etc).


I hope we can have some good discussion here.  If anybody has any questions

$50 x 365 = $18, Africa, Central/ and South America and even in Eastern Europe -- most of the world in fact, you could live on half of that sum. $500k drawn at 4% would be all you would need.

It seems a reoccurring question here is one of

Definitely sure. The pension portfolio/account is balanced and adjusted every month by PWGSC. Because the fund is a defined benefit plan, actual fund performance is measured against these forecasts. If a shortfall is predicted, the only thing that can be changed is the fund contributions amount. So future pensioners will bear the brunt of that cost. The cost of the pension may go up leading up to retirement, but we will always be guaranteed our full pension. Barring a huge financial crisis with government collapse. But then, I think we have larger issues at hand than just losing our pensions...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Greetings FI community!  …long-time listener

I’ve got a plan for a fairly early retirement that I think is solid but I would love to get your input.



Goal:  


FI ASAP!  I’m not against the idea of working *per se*, effectively, I want enough money to outright retire even though it’s probably overkill.



Details:


House: Valued at approx. $400

Debt: Nil besides the aforementioned mortgage.

Income: $160,000 due to taxes, dues, mandatory pension deductions, etc.

Living expenses: Aside from the mortgage we spend roughly $2, insurance, utilities, entertainment, etc.

Savings: Effectively nil.  We have $20, cash, emergency funds, and whatnot but they’re not really worth talking about in this context.

Pension: Here’s where the magic happens.  My wife and I have AMAZING pensions.  Defined



The plan:


So, and an indexed pension that will be able to cover those expenses after only 4 more years of working, our only real challenge is getting by until we hit the age of 60 and can begin to collect.


I think we can accomplish this with only 7 more years of employment.  Our current lifestyle allows us to bank about $70,000 in expenses).  We’re dumping all this money towards the mortgage.  That puts us with the house owned outright in 3 years and ~$300,000 in investments by the year 2020.  We then retire, sell the house (likely worth ~$450,000 by then), and move to a lower cost-of-living area.  At a conservative 3% withdrawal rate our $750,000 nest-egg would give us about $22, Indonesia
Once we hit 60 we can return to Canada and use part of our nest-egg (almost all $750
 

The obvious objection I see some of you raising is,500 should be enough to live decently in the lower cost-of-living areas of this country as well.”



I should also mention that my wife suggests working an additional 10 years instead of 7.  The “I don’t like working” side of me isn’t so keen on that plan but the overly cautious side of me can see some merit in it.  Working 10 years would adjust our numbers to: Nest-egg of ~$975,000 per year starting in the year 2040.



As a final note


So, I would like to get some outside opinions on my numbers and assumptions.  I’d be very grateful if you would point out any mistakes I’ve made or potential problems you foresee.

I would describe us as living fairly comfortably on that salary; we had a couple older used cars, and I always had just assumed that we were ""making it,"" but not by much.

I'm 23 currently and I'm finishing up a graduate degree. The median salary for someone in my field is roughly 50k/year

Questions in **bold** rest is information/rambling.

 [MMM says](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/05/29/how-much-do-i-need-for-retirement/) to reach this number, and multiply it by 25*. 

Currently my expenses for the past two years have averaged 27k. 27, the amount I need in an investment account is $675,000 before I can live off the interest. Based on my calculations at a 7% return rate, $675,000 minus the [Vanguard fee for VEXMX](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0098&amp;FundIntExt=INT) of 0.028% will earn interest of $43,057.06. That's 40 years of saving $450 a month with 7% return, to be able to retire in **2054**.

Not exactly 'early'. 

My calculated expenses are $28, at $475,770.12 in an investment account, I'll have enough to meet my $28,000 expenses off the interest! If I meet that goal, why does the 4% rule tell me to save up another $200,000?? 

 **Why is it not a good idea to just go ahead and retire at the $425k earning interest above/at my expense level?** I am asking this


For the above calculations I'm assuming 'a safe return of 7%'. With this, if I put $450 a month into paying my mortgage down instead, it'll be paid off in 13 years. No savings/investments though. Don't really want to go that route as I'd then be starting over for retiring early. **Should I be paying down debts/mortgage with my $450 a month instead of trying to invest?** I know the EARLIER you get started investing, the better off you are. I need to get started!


If I use the Vanguard ""10 year"" as return rate (10.7) on the [Vanguard EMF](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0098&amp;FundIntExt=INT),990.12.  That's 18 years instead of 40!! That's my idea of early retirement!! That is my goal. That's great, but not realistic I know. Still, this value of $329,000 is way less than the $675,000 using the MMM method. It's more attainable to me, especially at only being able to put in ~20% of my earnings into savings. There is absolutely no way currently, I'm not even out of debt yet (~$80

Last few questions. 

Obviously investing all my money into one index fund is probably not the smartest idea, compounds much slower than $450 into one. It would take me twice as long with two accounts to get to FI than with just one! The related question with this is **if I where to open another index fund account, should I open it at the same time as the first one, splitting $225 a month or put $450 into the first account, until it has enough money earned in interest ($3000) to open a second index fund THEN split the savings $225?**

I'm in my late 20's

I make about 110-120k per yr depending on the yr, taxes, and insurance. The apartment is fine for now, but we'll need more space eventually. I plan to buy another multi-unit to live in, or a single family home and cover the majority of that mortgage with the income from the building I live in now. We live below our means and are debt free. There are some small expenses we could cut out like cable and eating out, but for the most part they're reasonable and are small conveniences that are worth it at the moment.

I've been contributing 20% to my 401k each year and she's been contributing 18%. Between the both of our 401k's, but I think we can pull it off. My only worry is that we've contributed too much to our retirement accounts and haven't been keeping enough invested outside of that to live on the returns before we hit the traditional retirement age.

I have $400 in Ford (F) I was pulling $100 from each paycheck for two months and decided to dick around with it for fun.. figured ford was safe enough to not lose it all

then adding $1, try to pay it off it 5 (don't think it'll be a problem...)  around then my parents are moving to CO, I'll try to buy their house (worth ~$250k) and rent out the first house (dad owns a hardware store so I'm pretty handy, hopefully can take care of any issues myself)..  I'm expecting a 10% raise this month (part of agreement when I took my job)

in 2 years my gf (by then wife I hope) will be out of school and working (both are CS majors) hopefully pushing our income to &gt;$100k/yr  and I'm hoping with that we'll be retired 10-14 years from today (maybe right as 2nd house is done getting paid for) making me 34-38 and her 33-37 with 2 houses and hopefully ~700k invested

if you don't want to read through my entire post above (I don't blame you) I'm putting away $1500/mo (~60% of what I earn).. I hope I can tighten that up to 70% (I left my budget a little loose until I get a few months of tracking expenses figured out and can form a better budget)

I currently live in a state where housing is cheap and rent is relatively high in comparison. A friend of mine has five rent houses

I worked my way through college for a property management company

My current plan is to start buying rental property, and assuming each house needs minimum work to be ready to rent. At an average purchase price of $40,000.00 and an average rental price of $700.00, I could purchase 13 houses in 5 years. This would give me a annual income from rental property alone of $109,000.

Now let's talk real world situation. I will probably not be able to keep them rented, I will likely be promoted again, to $9,000.00 per month available for investment. With these increases in income, I should still be on track to purchase 13 houses in 5 years, even if I can't keep them rented.

1371049422.0,1g761a,Credit card question: what is the quantitative effect on my Credit score if I open &amp; close many cards,FockerCRNA,26,3,11,"So recently I've been pondering taking advantage of some of the bonuses that credit cards offer for signing up with them. I know that closing accounts can have a negative effect on the credit score because it can lower your utilization ratio (I think thats the correct term) and multiple inquiries can lower your score because that tends to indicate you are higher risk. But my question is how significant are the negative impacts of opening an account just for the bonus

Does it have an additive effect where by continuing this behavior I could go from 750 down to 450 based solely on that one tendency (I don't think this is likely)? Or would it have some measurable effect

There seem to be a lot of cards that I could open for big bonuses without having to pay fees

1360216361.0,181u7w,Maximizing After-Tax Returns,mega_shit,30,7,8,"These are now my yearly rituals I perform to maximize the amount of money I have invested in vehicles that defer taxes. Maybe you'll find them useful. Ultimately you need a lot of income to take advantage of all of these. I know not everyone is in that situation. I learned most of these from guys at work that also have a decent chunk of income each year.

* Max out your regular 401k contributions, but with the roth you basically end up saving more. This year that should be $17,500.
* This won't work for everyone. But if your employer allows for ""in plan withdraws"" from your 401k while you are still employed there it should. Max out your after-tax 401K contributions. This year you can have total contributions of $51K into your 401k account. That means if your employer matches 0% (assholes) then you can contribute $33, roll over the $33,500 from your after-tax 401k into your roth IRA.
* Make a non-deductible contribution of $5,500 in your roth IRA + 401k that grows tax deferred forever and no taxes on withdraws.
* Now max out your HSA contributions. Your employer might help here as well
* Then go buy $10K worth of I-bonds. Interest on these will grow tax-deferred. Later on in life you'll try to time the withdraw of these so that you're in a lower tax bracket upon redeeming them.  You can also buy $10K of series EE bonds.
* Got a kid? A niece? A nephew? Contribute to their 529 account. Earnings in these accounts grow tax deferred and can be withdrawn tax free if they are used for qualified educational expenses. For me I put around $6K per kid into these accounts each year.
* Have a low income family member you trust? Maybe a sister / brother? You can gift to them up to $13K each year. Make sure they use that money to put into their own Roth IRA / I-bonds (they can always get the I-bonds but make sure they have taxable income so they can do the Roth IRA contribution)


For me this adds up to about ~$105K each year in investments that are in tax-deferred or tax exempt vehicles. Naturally, stocks or bond funds that have large amounts of income / dividend payouts.
Now with any remaining income

Short term goals (before the end of the year):
- Save $10K as 'emergency funds'
- Contribute more to 401K once I have a decent amount saved in bank or if I get a raise.

Mid term goals (sometime next year):
- Move out of condo and rent it out.  Hoping to rent it out for more than the mortgage.  When I bought it, I can easily find something for $1000-$1200.

Long-term goals:
- Once I'm contributing my max to 401K and have my emergency funds lined up

My question - should I pay my car off as soon as I can? This way I won't have any debt and can start saving a lot of money once I have the car paid off?

Should I chill out a bit. Start putting around $300/month allowing me to have more money/month that I can use towards saving now so I can start investing sooner

I recently graduated and I have a job as a software developer. I currently live in a rental flat with my SO, Europe.

The problem with apartments (rental scenario) are the associated noise and lack of options for changing or improving things.

The problem with housing (purchase scenario) is that I am tied down and practically all of my income is tied into the house - this is almost regardless of what kind of a dump I purchase

I work 45 kilometers away (that is about 28 miles for you imperials out there)

My SO studies where we currently live

I get a decent wage 420.000 DKK (ca 72.000 USD) a year, food etc. My SO gets about 62000 DKK (11.000 USD) a year in stipends and has no debt, nor will she have any debt when she finishes this summer. (We expect her to be able to find a job which will provide approximately the same amount of wage as me, so ~ 72.000 a year. I have wiped out my savings on the car. Still have an emergency fund for dental bills etc. 

I've begun reading the links in the side-bar but at this pace

We don't spend a lot on food

I have about 100.000 DKK (ca 17.000 USD) in student debts

Children are not a part of the plan as of this moment but that could change. 

I have no investments

So to sum it all up:

* What are the essentials to read

* How do I make a plan on what to do

* Rent or purchase? Rental(apartment) or purchase (dump (incl. cost to fix it up) vs a generally good house (which thus does not have so many things to fix

* Concerning investments

Hm, but I could really need some help.

I've been working at making our lives more frugal, but this number is all over the place depending on the market. I've really only added 32K of real money.

Rent	                                $700

Partying		                $400

Food			                $300

Car Loan		                $200

Incidental		                $200

Utilities	                   	$175

Car insurance	                $150

Gas			                $120

Cell Phone		                $50

Internet		                $40

Cable			                $35


Total			               $2370

Yes, we would have to spend $800 on rent. He also insisted that a car, cell phone, and cable were basic human needs in the 21st century. Apparently cable is a human need, while health insurance is not.  Many people in my class commented that this budget seemed really small, and he assured them that once they made more money, they could get a better car and a mortgage

Then he talked to us about 401k and IRA. He said that if we just put 10% of our net pay in a 401k or IRA at 5% interest,000 by the time we want to retire at 60! Everyone in the class made wooing sounds, and the kid behind me said that compound interest is the most powerful thing in the world. 

I said that his model ignores inflation, laughed, and went on talking about the services that the bank he works for offers. He urged us all to open a saving account with .01% interest and several monthly fees.

I felt a bit angry that my economics teacher allowed for all this misinformation to propagate

Is this how the FI community remembers their personal finance education?

I read all the fine print there isn't a catch that I can find. I don't have any debt other than my student loans which are at around 2% APR - but I don't want to try to pay those off within a year. Are there any nifty tricks to take advantage of that free money for 12 months? Perhaps make a few bucks from it? It would have to be low risk of course. 

EDIT: I'm well aware of the risk of credit cards (which is why I have zero CC debt) but if you can get free money and lend it at any rate you've come out ahead right? As long as you make your payments on time and don't get caught up in the penalties. What I'm looking for is a way to make a few bucks on that free money. Not get myself into debt.

If all goes according to plan I will graduate with no student loans. However

Before going back to school I have made it a priority to get a credit card for the year with the purpose of building some credit. I would simply make any purchases I would normally make on my debit card on my credit card. I also am trying to put in place a process by which the bank would take out 50 dollars a month from my paycheck and put it into my investment fund.

* $90 monthly transit (April will be the last pass I buy)

* $4-$30 Social Dinning 
* $0-$35 Gas (Usually $0)
* $0-$100 Toys (Usually $0)
* $0-$100 Clothing  (Usually $0)

I'm 29/M/UK married. I have 100k GBP in accounts (60k in a 5% interest savings account


**Plan** 

I've got a plan to early retire in 2018 - by that time with my current rate of saving and investments matching inflation

* Buy a property abroad with some land
* Thumb-to-the-wind living expenses - 8k/yr including maintenance
* A 4% withdrawal rate on the cash leftover is 8.5k/yr

**Problem**

The above situation would work perfectly assuming that I wanted to live in that house until my dying days but the country I'd like to live in has horrible social welfare, this 200k would be worth the equilvalent of 70k now - not even enough to buy a studio apartment)

**Alternate Solution**

With that in mind

This would give me the following figures by 2018 I'd have:

* 165k in savings and/or investments
* Property worth 110k (rent has gone into the above figure)

At the point of cutover to living abroad I would have:

* 7k in rent (I'd have a lower tax bracket since it'd be my only earnings but that's offset by management costs)
* I'd only need a 1% withdrawal rate to match my first-scenario income
* I'd have a property worth 110k+ 
* My remaining savings would match inflation as long as I kept my means within 8k/yr so I could comfortably sell any assets and relocate back to the UK at any point into a property.

**Questions**

* It seems that the road is paved with gold when it comes to buying a property - house prices have gone up 8% in the last year in London for example
* While a savings account/investment account will give me constant income with no real effort on my part
* Is there an alternate opportunity that's likely to give me similar returns? I'd really like some general advice!

* **Motivation and mindset:** Keep an exercise log (use google docs?) and set goals for yourself. Get a playlist for working out. Work out at the same times every week. Don't break your routine unless you need recovery time. Stay positive and never get mad at yourself. Push yourself.
* **Social aspects:** Do team sports. Go running with a friend or co-worker. Join related forums and subreddits. Find a friend with a similar outlook and informally coach one another (I'm on a similar routine as a friend of mine

I'm totally new to the loan world


The Loans:


USAA (through Wells Fargo) student loan:

These are rough numbers that I pulled from their website but ""as low as a 3.2% APR."" but the big appeal is no payments for 6 months after graduation. Since I have no idea what my job situation will look like then and I will have to manage a lot more liabilities like insurances/bills ect. this holds appeal. It also holds appeal because I will most likely have no income over the next 4 or 5 months. 

Subsidized Stafford Loan:

No interest until 6 months after graduation. But I suppose you have to make monthly payments before that. I don't know how wise this is to do when I have zero income. I believe this is the government student loan and APRs vary a bit. I'm expecting (ill call both places tomorrow to get accurate numbers) around a 6%ish APR.

I see the following three options for housing:

1) Live on base, relatively no-hassle way to have a house with my wife.

2) Live off base and rent an apartment. This is what I currently do, but there are a lot of things that both of us value that apartment living cannot offer. 

3) Live off base but buy a house. I would receive the housing allowance but instead of using it to pay a landlord I could build some equity and perhaps generate additional income. 

I want to make this clear: My intention is NOT to get a mortgage, with the house paid for, I could use the housing allowance to pay for utilities, maintenance, taxes and insurance - and pocket the rest. As long as those expenses and any improvements I wanted to make do not exceed the $10-15K or so per year in allowance, I would be in the green. If I made efforts to keep them low, I could be making quite a bit of additional income without losing a penny to rent.

The easy pros:

* A house for my wife and (future) family

* Creative control over our living space

* A backyard

* A garage

Addressing some easy cons:

* As far as maintenance

* As far as breaking the “5 year rule

1373086154.0,1hqfwp,Financial Advice appreciated for 24 year old,jackster1232002,18,5,11,"Hello

I am 24 years old and have a stable job. This is my current financial breakdown:

58k Annual Income
12% contribution to Sep IRA (I don't pay a penny of this
30k invested in growth income fund (started in 2011)
50k in savings

Currently I am paying roughly 1.5k a month towards rent, and general spending (food, etc).

I am looking at purchasing a home right at 100k with 20% down and at 3.5% 15 year note. I have been working with my realtor for months now trying to find a home

Edit: Seems I am getting alot advice about not pursing purchasing a home. A little bit of more information. Average rent costs in my area is about 850 per month w/ application fees and deposits that equate to almost a month's worth of rent. I am looking at a 15 year mortgage at right around 500 per month. I am also looking at homes that are below market price mainly because I am looking at foreclose/short sale/motivated seller. And yes I plan to get a home inspector to inspect every inch of the place. And yes I don't bother pursing a home if it needs a considerable amount of work done on it. And yes I know sometimes you can't see what is wrong with the home

Now lets say worst case I sell the home at price, and closing costs to consider. But still from the amount I would receive back after the sell, it would outweigh the costs of paying rent every month.

So my main question is, what should be my next course of action? 

Should I: 

Start a roth IRA on top of the SEP IRA my employer provides?
Contribute more to my growth and income fund?
Start a new mutual fund all together?
Hoard money and look to purchase a new property while renting out the 100k home i plan to purchase soon?

Wife and I talk a lot about finances and are frugal and smart

* age: both 23
* income: ~$50k yr disposable after all spending, etc. 
* savings: $20k at &lt;1%
* 401k: $15k + ~$20k/yr.
* roth ira: $10k in vanguard
* debt: only to society!

Our short-term goal (next 1-3 years) is to save for a down payment to purchase a house to live in. Our home purchase price is looking to be a minimum ~$400k given we have to live in a certain upscale area (familial/work constraints) and we plan on having enough space to raise a family in. Expect to have kids before we're 27. 

Couple questions

* Does it make sense to look for investment vehicles other than a savings acct while we save for our down payment? I hope to use Vanguard and get some index funds eventually
* Should we get a cheap starter home before kids are in the picture? I'm not sure if a straight calculation of the equity we gain for a year or two of ownership vs the costs of closing on a home is that simple. Mortgage rates are low which is enticing. I could probably get some extra funds to secure a DP on a starter if I needed
* I feel like we should actually lower our contribution to 401k's in a few years. (Right now we're a bit over the match) since if we get to about say $125k by the time we're 30
* Any other suggestions for investments down the line, probably something similar to MMM, index funds, maybe dabble in a few more risky things to diversify.

Options I've been pondering:

* A - Pay the minimums on the house and the smaller student loan

* B - Pay the minimums on both student loans

An added bonus of option B is that I'd (presumably) hit the 80% mark on the home/loan value more quickly

So

**Issue #2** -- I'm currently saving well above the suggested 15% for retirement (I save about 18% into real retirement funds -- IRA and 401k -- and then probably another 5% or so into precious metals and unofficial retirement savings -- a standard brokerage account).  I know the common suggestion is 15%

* C - Stopping all retirement savings until the student loans are paid off (as Dave Ramsey would suggest)

* D - Cut back to the suggested 15% until the loans are paid off

* E - Continue as I am right now.

This is my first post here.  I just wanted to say thanks for the inspiration!  A few years ago I was not at all thinking about my financial outlook and was really careless with my money.  

At the beginning of this year I got a promotion which carried a raise of a little over 60% of my previous salary.  Since January I've paid off the remaining balance of our car loan(3.6K)

We are in the process of refinancing our home loan.  We are going from a 30 year loan at 4.75% to a 15 year loan at 3%.  We've eliminated PMI so our monthly payment only goes up $100!  I'm 25 and the prospect of eliminating our house payment by age 40 absolutely gives me goosebumps.  

I apologize if this is a FI 101 question but should I continue to make extra payments(Probably roughly $300-500/month) on to the home loan to knock that off quicker?  Should I use that money to buy in to some mutual funds?  After employer contributions my 403B account is getting 10%.  

Also my wife and I have a son who is 20 months old.  We will be trying to get pregnant again in the next year.  My wife has a somewhat modest income and honestly does not like her job(Who does?).  Day care in our area is easily 500-600$/child monthly...We've decided that my wife will be staying home and doing day care for our kids and a few others.  Do any of you have experience doing this?

From my perspective, it takes up space and causes clutter in our house.  So I'm a little anti-stuff by default. Every item we have in our house needs to save us time or make our lives better in some way.  If it doesn't make our lives better or really save time, let's throw it out and be done with it!  I'm not opposed to having stuff, we just need to do a cost/benefit analysis so we don't end up with a lot of junk, while we don't have the items we really want.  If we haven't bought it yet, then the happiness we get from it better be more than what I'd get from buying something else or spending less time at work.  That being said, I think that wandering around a store like some sort of consumer whore looking at shiny objects is a *horrible* exercise.  If we didn't feel a want for it while we were at home

From her perspective, put it back.""  In reality I'm saying no such thing.  I just want her to do a cost/benefit analysis on buying stuff.  Bubble bath that costs a dollar and makes you more relaxed?  Go right ahead and buy it.

I can't find any enjoyment in it, stuck in their own traps of spending, debt and unease is a bit frustrating to me.

We plan on living on 30K and dividing the rest of the money between paying off the student loans quickly and building savings. 

I'm thinking that we can save money and pay our debts faster by getting a 60K construction to mortgage loan to build a small kit house (this is about 2x the quoted price of the house, is that if we're paying $800 for our crappy apartment, it would actually save us money to get a mortgage loan since the payments would likely be lower than our rent. Once we pay off the loans (in about 2 years), we could easily pay off the house in another 2 years. And we would have a small property that eventually be a source of income by renting it if/when we decide to move. 

Is this a good tactic? Is there a glaring hole in my plan?  Should I avoid having more debt until we pay off what we've got already?

Edit: Thanks for all the info! I've definitely got some things to consider now. I'll definitely ask around to see if with taxes and other costs we'd still come out ahead.

Those are my finances.  I want to cut back to part time work by the time I'm 40-45
So far my strategy is to simply, and continue to reinvest my dividends into the positions.  Ideally, I'd like to live off $40,000 passive income by the time I'm 40.  I'm still saving and working on cutting down costs.
I'm wondering how realistic my goals are?  And if they are achievable with a dividend reinvestment strategy?

First off

* Car loan | $360/month minimum
* Student Loan 1 | $50/month minimum
* Student Loan 2 | $100/month minimum
* Credit card debt | $19/month minimum

Here's how I got here - I've been paying on **Student Loan 1** for a long time,000 owed to $500. My plan was to use all of this money to pay off the loan, but then my car brakes went out, and I had to put $1,800 down on a credit card to pay for the repairs. Now I'm trying to determine what the best course of action long-term would be for what to do with this other $500. Should I...

1. Put it down on the credit card to take it from $1
2. Put it towards the rest of **Student Loan 1**
3. Put it towards my car
4. Open a new savings account (I don't have one right now) and start it off with $500 cash. 

I am leaning towards opening a savings account, I could go ahead and pay off the rest of **Student Loan 1** and be done with it, never having to make another payment again, thus opening up available money to me.

Any advice?

Thanks!

Our current free cashflow is around 25K.  Assuming 5% returns and continued investment at this level

I make above median income of 69K.  With prepaid cellphones, coupons for groceries, etc., there just don't seem to be many more silver nuggets of savings left.  

Even those silver nuggets, they don't do that much to the bottom line.  Housing is 51% of our expenses.  It's the white elephant in the room, but rarely talking about on the finance boards.  My wife has been awesome with nearly every frugal sacrifice...and let's face it, there are sacrifices.  Giving up cable saved $60 per month, but that's no where near the 1.2K we pay each month for our house.  It's our biggest expense.  Throwing nearly every free cent at our mortgage would still take 5 years to pay it off.  However, we could pay off less expensive property in a little over 2 years.

We've been looking at refinancing our mortgage and we have currently two options to us.

A Traditional Mortgage or the Streamline FHA

We paid $500 for an appraisal for the traditional

    If we got this it would give us a monthly savings of $278
    If we went with the streamline it would only give us a $180

Now I have approx $7000 in stocks that have under-performed.

Would you sell the stocks to pay the extra $4000?

If I went with an FHA would I have to refinance again to get rid of the Mortgage Insurance?

Other factors are that I've gotten a raise of about $100 - $200 basically would mean I'd have an extra $400 or more coming in a month if I did the traditional mortgage vs $300 with the streamline FHA Another factor is we have to spend approximately $300 to place flooring in two of our back rooms to get either mortgage.

(throwaway account

So, though I've lived in the U.S. the majority of my life.  I can think of so many things I would fill my time with if I could.  Time is everything, and I dislike how much of it work sucks up.

Right now, I'll rent the house out.  To be honest, I strongly dislike the entire region I live in, but it's cheap.

I have a Bachelor's

I get my travel fix via an airline credit card.  I put all of my expenses on it and pay it off every month.  I get free tickets and fly where I feel when I can line up a place to stay (relatives or fans...was a notable name in a competitive gaming scene in the past so people've put me up when travelling).

I decided to correct my spending about three months ago.  I've been getting about 33% in savings a month since then with only minimal life changes.  I'm going to try to push it to 50% next year if I can.  This is after taxes/401k contributions/benefits

(33% == **~$1

I'm not really capable of going full Jason-style ERE, and no fast food ever.

I put my employer match in to my 401k.  I see people saying to max the 401k, but I don't see why I should put extra in to the 401k when I can probably invest it elsewhere better.

Thing is

Right now I have: 

* $5k emergency fund.

* $2k in a Forex account, but the 2 winning trades made me break even on the 8 losing. I don't know if this will work long term or not.

* $3k in a stock account

* My 401k


**I owe &lt;30k on my house** at 5.25% interest.  If I maintain the last three month's saving rate (without raising it to 50% like I hope)


So...I don't know where to go from here.  If I make consistent returns on trading, with a loan.  I hate taking on more debt, but the math works out.

What do you guys think?  Kill off the house debt? Or invest, but taking on debt for real estate makes me nervous.

1324662360.0,no42e,Fighting the good fight: Thinking differently about your expenses,johnsmithindustries,9,2,6,"On an almost daily basis

1) **""Fixed"" Recurring Expenses** - These are expenses that are relatively fixed in cost, insurance premium (even if you pay every 6 months, divide by 6 to get your $/month), etc.

2) **Discretionary Expenses** - Everything else. Food, entertainment, utilities, etc. 

This either-or concept may raise a few eyebrows

**Discretionary:**

Entertainment and recreation are typically thought of as discretionary

However

For example, the cost is highly relative and entirely based on the choices you make. You can choose to eat at nice restaurants every day, or you can choose to cook at home. You can choose to use expensive or inexpensive ingredients. You can choose to grow your own vegetables rather than buy them. For this reason, I believe food should be treated as a flexible budget item, not $X00/month. If you budget $200/month for food - it's likely you'll find a way to spend $200/month. But if you treat it as an expense that is dependent upon the choices you make, you'll find yourself making better ones. Your mental food budget should start at $0 per month, and each decision you make while on an empty stomach adds to that amount.

For utilities, to lower/raise the thermostat, to zone heat, or not. Perhaps you run your hot tub 24/7. Again, since your expenses are relative to your behavior this should be a *discretionary* expense. Your mental utility budget should start at $0 every month and only go up.

I've found that this shift in my thinking towards our expenses has produced some pretty awesome results. Our electric bill (1000 sq ft apt, but thankfully we derive a lot of joy from cooking and it actually forms part of our recreation as well (she loves to cook, I love to eat.) - we are about to get below $200/month, and in the future I hope to achieve $100-150 or less.

**Recurring Expenses:**

Even given that success

Debt can be considered a fixed,000 car loan at 5% interest may have $500/month payments, but it will also generate ~$100/month in interest if left alone. Accelerated debt repayment is a double-whammy to me - get closer to freedom, reduce your expenses simultaneously.

So far this year:

* Eliminated cable - You've heard this one a thousand times by now

* Raised insurance premiums, but represents ~$30/month saved.

* Eliminated renter's insurance - Nice emergency fund means we can self-insure now. $14/month

* Paid off a car, this was a fun one!

A significant life change in the near future may be bringing some interesting changes with it. Next up on the proverbial chopping block? Possibly a vehicle

TL;DR - Think of most expenses as discretionary and it will shift your attitude towards them in a financially positive way. Attack your recurring expenses with a vengeance

I like to think that I have at least some semblance of financial responsiblity. I have a monthly budget that I try to strictly adhere to.  I make sure to wait out any major purchases and make sure that I need them

My current starting salary is $50, I will get full details once I am eligible to start)

I guess my question for the folks here is what are some ways that I can start working towards Financial Independence now? I am currently 21 years old turning 22 very soon

I currently have about $6500 in savings

Some things that I have been thinking of doing are the following:

1. Making sure once I am eligible to pay towards my 401k to take advantage of the matching funds. This means at 25% matching up to $1000 I would have to put in $4000 to get the full advantage which is doable with my current savings per month.

2. Paying off my car (about $6k owed on it) I plan on keeping this until I run it into the ground. I am not the type of person who really cares what kind of car I drive.

3. Opening up a traditional IRA (good idea?) I know you can put in $17

4. Opening up a roth IRA

5. I've heard about something called Vanguard? I haven't looked into it much but it seems to be the GO TO over at /r/personalfinance.

I am wondering which of these I should prioritize that will give me the most benefit. 

Also

Also

Factoring all that in I am thinking that sometime next year I should be able to gain an extra $600-$700 per month which would greatly help towards putting money into IRA's/investments. 

Anyways any advice or help would be GREATLY appreciated. I think I at least have some idea of what I want to do but then again

I'd like to know your thoughts regarding some investment options. I'm from Australia. Here we don't have IRAs or 401k accounts. We have a setup called ""Superannuation"". It's an account that your employer must by law put 9% of your salary in
 
I have recently (at the age of 30),000 in investment savings, I really should have saved more. I've also left my investments in the default option, if I had managed these into shares more, I would have $69,000 by now. But anyway, better late then never.
 
I'm lucky in that the company I now work for, I plan to divert another 6% of my salary to this fund so I will get 20% going in each year, starting from this year.
 
Anyway, etc. And what I'd really like to do with my super money is invest it in vanguard index funds, Australian, World &amp; US market funds.
 
The problem is, does not allow me to invest the funds in Vanguard. They only provide 6 investment options, for special funds created for members of the funds. They aren't index's, they are actively managed funds. (I would prefer passive investment.)
 
On the plus
 
I have located other funds that will allow me to have more choice over where my funds go
 
The thing is, EG to invest in the Vanguard Australian Index fund it would be a total of 0.93% + $69 or 0.96% + $69 if I want to invest in the World Ex Australia Vanguard index.
 
So this situation changes the game slightly with regards to the indexing vs mutual funds argument.
 
Am I better off pushing towards an index fund anyway with these higher fee's
 
Or if there are any Aussies around here

Here's what I am getting at.

A numberof recent studies have shown that retirement planning really isn't effective in the sense that after all the commissions etc your funds are less or equal to the money you actually put away.

I only know successful retirement people in ads who seem to all want to buy vineyards with the great plans their investment advisors want to make commission off of.

I would like real world examples of people who did these types of things and to know whether you did better than simply the money you socked away in total.

It has to be after all is said and done - including all unanticipated bankruptcties of pensions

In other words has anyone added up all their non social security contributions over their lifetime and then calulated how much of that they have access to at retirement?

If so I love to know yourt actual rate of retrun or whatever other measure of return you have made that you would like to use.

Remember it has to exclude social security.

The most effective thing you did it with would be nice to know as well.

I'm glad there's been so much interest in this still very young subreddit. I'm especially happy to see that the discussion is active

I've read [your comments](http://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/mmfu6/what_brought_you_to_rfi_are_you_financially/) on what you want this subreddit to be. People are coming from a lot of different places and aren't all looking for the same things--but I think that's great because it means there are many opportunities for us to learn from one another.

Anyway

1. A healthy space for people to discuss all non-consumerist approaches to personal finance and frugality. This includes everything from radical ideas to small practical changes
2. A place where no one will say
3. A place where people can ask any financial-lifestyle question that's utterly outside of the mainstream and get a set of awesome
4. A subreddit that will challenge our assumptions about personal finance.

So far

I've been trying to figure out how we can make this subreddit stay good,000 members. One thing I've done is think about the rules, which are, as of this post:

* Be nice.
* Keep an open mind.
* Don't be a [complainypants](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/10/07/how-to-tell-if-youre-a-complainypants/). It's fine to criticize a bad idea
* Constructive criticism is always allowed and encouraged.
* No memes. No sarcasm.

I've explained some of my reasoning in the sections below

----

**Reddiquette**

Reddit's voting mechanism works against this subreddit

There's nothing I can do about this

It's basic Reddiquette: for the good of the subreddit, or ideas that ""wouldn't work for you.""

I know some people won't like this--but **I am considering disabling downvote arrows for submissions in this subreddit**.

----

**""Don't be a complainypants?""**

In order to keep the conversation positive

* ""I am perfectly happy to *not* do this and *not* save me a few euros per year
* ""He lost me when he got to the lentils.""
* ""Goddamit
* ""he's hardly living a typical 'middle-class' lifestyle""
* ""Whoever wrote this article comes off as merely cynical and narrow minded. He reminds me of the old Australian guy who bitches about everything and blogs about it all.""

If that's your response, ask yourself ""How can I learn from this?"" 

Consider this: [r/frugal](/r/frugal) is generally healthy,000 subscribers. (If we get there!)

Because the subreddit is a very manageable size

----

**Other rules?**

If you have comments on the other rules

Rules I am already considering:

* If you want to call out an idea for not being frugal
* No politics.

The first rule could help keep the discussion constructive.

The ""no politics"" rule was suggested to me by a subscriber, I'm ready to change the rules.

**So

Just to be clear: constructive criticism of every submission will always be allowed and encouraged.",,t5_2t34z,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/mr3lj/dont_be_a_complainypants_rfi_what_do_you_think/

**Moderator duties**

In some subreddits

* Monitor the spam and reports queues

* Help revise the FAQ
* Help plan community threads and organize AMA's

Until the subreddit becomes essentially self-sustaining

* Submit 3 links or self post per week
* Be active
* Promote the subreddit

**So what do I do if I want to become a mod?**

Just reply to this thread! Answer these questions:

1. Why would you make a good mod?
2. What's your financial lifestyle like? How close are you to FI? (I want to get some diversity among the mods in this sense)
3. Have you moderated a forum

I hear it's smart to have an emergency fund of a few months to live off of at least. So currently I have that and a retirement account. So currently I'm in good shape and can just continue to chip away at my loans. But part of me wants to use one account to seriously pay off loans and reduce my monthly payment and then if shit hits the fan I can empty the IRA. Is this a dumb decision? Also in the back of my mind I keep thinking that if anything were to ever happen, with more money saved each month because of a lower monthly payment, I could put more in my retirement account each month.

**Background**

* I am 22. 
* I have no debt (school or otherwise) and will not have any come graduation (May 2012). 
* I have ~30k in savings at the moment.
* I live in the midwest.
* Health insurance is a non-issue. It is covered by my employer.

**The Plan** (*warning: MATH AHEAD*)

Effective January 2012.

I first calculate [my annual expenses](http://i.imgur.com/oqIin.png). Each year,160/mo).

I then consider my annual income. Gross income is 50k. Less taxes (@27%) makes net income $36

So,232) = $21,268/yr.

Assuming I stay within that expense budget

I live in the midwest. A nice home will come at ~$275

If I want to buy a $275k home,029 in three years. (30k savings + 3*$21,268 saved income = $94,029). I make the 20% down payment of $55k, which leaves me with ~40k still in savings.

I follow this up with a 5 year mortgage and pay it off

I know that there's a ton of assuming in this, please let me know. I'd be more than happy to hear about how I can make this plan better than it is. There is definitely room for improvement. Hopefully this can help others build a plan, as well. It's never too early to think about these things.

This might be a no brainer after I explain the situation but I'm very interested in others opinions and view.  I have a really good job that pays me much more than I would be getting back in the states (where I am from).  Part of this is due to the very strong yen right now

In about a years time I would certainly have enough saved up for the down payment on a home here in Japan.  As it stands right now we (my girlfriend and I) are paying rent which means a 0% return.  Not surprising as rent isn't an investment.  We have tinkered with the idea of buying a house or a condo but as I have started to talk with other home owners they have informed me that property in Japan usually depreciates instead of appreciating like in other countries.  The mentality is that an older house is worth less than a newer house, and three months later another house.

My other option is to send my savings back to the USA everything month.  Right now 100 yen is about $1.30.  That is pretty amazing!  If the US economy ever recovers and the Yen weakens this might be a missed opportunity.  But If I am sending money back to the USA I won't have savings here for a down payment

What I would like hear from other people is do you think this would be a good idea.  I'm going to find out more talking to more home owners as far as what is the amount of depreciation, etc.  But even if the house depreciates 50% when I sell it I'm at least getting back 50% (minus of course any upkeep, etc.).  Compared to rent, 0% return, this has got to be the better decision right? ",,False,t5_2t34z,True

I have done some background reading, but without the bother of working.

**The Situation**

We have jobs, no time with the kid, blah blah blah.

What we want is $120K CDN per year

What we have is this:

* $600K cash
* $129K in a tied up defined pension plan
* $700K equity in a house that we do not want to sell
* $170K of an unused HELOC

What we owe is this:

* $300K mortgage
* nothing else

**Questions**

1. How much do we need to have invested in order to make us our $120K per year

2. How can we turn $600K (or $770K) into that amount?

I guess the question really is this: if you have a bit of seed money, hysterically.

I'm 30 and have only been working full-time for 2.5 years due to screwing around when I was younger (took me 8 years to graduate university).

As a result of this (and my own stupidity) I'm only now starting a retirement fund.  I make approx 60k after bonuses annually and right now I have an initial chunk of 5k to invest

This is obviously way less than what I need to retire on.  What am I missing here?  Is the 5% compound interest not the right calculation to do?  Should I somehow calculate how my monthly input will increase as I make a higher salary?

Monthly income after tax (not including bonuses): 3169

Why?

I propose that the vast majority of us will ""make"" 18-20% returns for the remaining lifetime of our mortgage if we pay it off when we reach FI. More if you take on a side business.

Say you need 60k a year to live on if you're paying your mortgage. If you have a 15k/year mortgage and you pay it off

Assuming you live off of cap gains in the us


Why not do this before FI? Because you're probably not going to change the amount you earn from earned income based on the amount you need. So you will earn 100k and get taxed 20k (ish) whether or not you actually need it to live off of

Thoughts?

ok, which is high here in canada... naw i doubt it would even pay for food

my husband and i just went thru heck, car, credit rating, but now my husband has his job back, and we are living in an apartment, back to living paycheck to paycheck where most goes to taxes and rent and such... 

now i've got a piece of land to put an RV on, and i have a disability, how much would my husband have to earn if we are not paying rent and high income tax?  would it be feasible for him to actually get a job at age 50 doing (dare i think it) something he may enjoy but doesn't pay that well? and have us 'get by'? does anyone know how to help me make these calculations in my head?  

any websites you can point me to?  i would say 'let's go honey, but car insurance is expensive in canada...

i just feel that we can do it, and i don't know how to explain this to my terrified husband who is UNWILLING to be jobless EVER AGAIN lol

help???

**Me:**
25 years old, based on my review score in the fall. My job is secure and should see continued future growth in salary as I advance.


**Assets:**
Car (worth roughly 15k

Pre-Tax 401(k): about 30k, pre-tax, or traditional contributions here. I use pre-tax since I'm already in the 28% tax bracket, and it saves me some money on taxes.

IRA: 5k (just started last year. stupid me.) Will contribute 5k annually and backdoor it into a Roth IRA.

Taxable Brokerage account: 40k right now. I don't keep careful track of the cost basis

Cash/CD's/Money Market: Basically none. I keep 3k-4k around in checking + savings accounts for bills and whatnot

I own no stocks directly, 30% international, 5% bonds. I figure I can withstand some volatility at this stage. I plan to make the allocation more conservative as I get older.


**Liabilities:**
My only debt is that I owe about 400k on my house, or 5 years have passed, whichever comes later. When I get to the 5 year mark, if I want to stay in the house, I'll make a balloon payment of around 40k to get rid of the PMI.
