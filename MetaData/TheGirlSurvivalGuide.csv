1371584869.0,1glsy5,I would like to share my abortion experience....,Halcyoningenue,908,155,228,"When finding out my partner of 8 months and I were pregnant


Since I found out my pregnancy early on, I gave up on a natural abortion and started making plans with planned parenthood.


Planned parenthood was courteous and after a few appointments for a pregnancy test


Yesterday, and gave me the option of looking at the image, keeping a picture of it, telling me if I had twins or not, or if I didn't want to know anything at all. I chose to not know, to keep as much emotional detachment to this process as possible. They then showed me to another room where a lady gave me a cup of multiple pills where she explained exactly what they were and what they did. She said they were basically to get me drowsy and to help with anxiety before the procedure. She than placed me in the waiting room till the pills kicked in and I was ready to start the procedure. 


I met my doctor who would be performing the abortion, while the nurse at hand and an intern who asked to be present stood by in case I toppled over from the medication. I sat on the table and draped the paper over my lap, put my feet in the stirrups, and the doctor returned. During the abortion he explained everything he did before he was about to do it to put me at ease. He would tell me when he was about to do something that made cramping, and the nurse would automatically rub my lower belly, and the intern would be standing by asking if I needed the hot water bottle. But the cramping I experienced from the abortion was much less than the cramping I had experienced from just a regular period. The really only pain I would say I experienced was just the slight pressure of inserting the speculum to open the vaginal canal, and also the pressure of opening the cervix. The actual suction of the abortion was basically painless. 
Within 7 min. the abortion was done, and asked how I felt and If I had any more questions. I replied I felt fine, and he wished me luck and left. The nurse helped me get dressed, even though I had no nausea or pain, then escorted me to the recovery room where a nice older lady gave me another heating pad and drinks and snacks. She asked me after awhile to check my pad and tell her the amount of blood was there, for safety just in case I didn't clot properly. Only a small amount existed, and I was able to sit in the waiting room for as long as I wanted. I left soon after


I know this story is very undramatic and simple, sometimes there is relief and a feeling of wholeness again. I had an extremely pleasant experience with my abortion, and still plan on it being my last. Before the procedure I asked to have the Nexplanon inserted, so now I know I'll be pregnancy free for the next three years! 
I welcome any and all questions

Peace!

**tltr: had an surgical abortion that was very pleasant



**EDIT:** By posting this I was aiming for just a basic medical account of what exactly happened and a whole can of worms exploded! I mean it in the best way possible, sparkly badges that we wear on our dresses. They are scars of experiences that were earned through blood, sweat, and emotional turmoil. And I think it is our job and duty as women to keep it honest between each other and the rest of society, on exactly what we go through and to be as supportive as possible. Because women know what is best for women, and this post just fills me with joy seeing all these brave women share their stories with details that would make the manliest man squirm in his pants! What I mean is, this post affirms in me the fact that we need to, take what we have said here into the real world and share the raw facts with others in our daily lives. I would love to see these conversations being had openly some day with girls faced with this decision from their friends, and more of a support group for women now

Works best if your hair is still slightly damp.

2. **Large pores? Egg white facial!**  
Crack an egg. Separate the white and yolk, and then rinse it off. 

3. **Sleep with your hair braided for awesome waves in the morning.**

4. **While brushing your teeth

5. **Drinks plenty of water.**  
This helps with everything from dry skin to acne to your general health. 

6. **Cracked dry feet? Lotion + cotton socks before bed.**

7. **Brush your teeth with baking soda to whiten your smile.**

8. **Swollen

9. **DO NOT WASH YOUR FACE TOO MUCH!**  
Not only does it dry your skin out

10. **Always take your makeup off before bed!**  
Keep makeup remover wipes next to your bed if you have to

11. **Vitamins**  
Your hair

12. **Shave in two directions to achieve the smoothest of pits.**

13. **If you have light brows
It can be scary at first and it takes some getting used to

14. **A dab of shimmery white shadow in the inner corners of your eyes will make them look bigger and brighter.**

15. **Use brown sugar to exfoliate.**  
But no more than twice a week.

-Neutrogena oil free acne wash in the shower every morning ($7)

-St. Ives exfoliating Apricot Scrub once a week ($5)

-Neutrogena Exfoliating Body Clear Body Scrub every day for my back and boobs ($8)

-Neutrogena Rapid Clear Acne Treatment Pads before bed every night ($7)

This worked pretty well for me, while it was mostly successfully at keeping acne away, it dried my face out too much and caused my skin to produce more oil to compensate. 

Now my skin care routine looks like this:

-[Dr. Bronner's tea tree oil castile soap](http://www.amazon.com/Dr-Bronners-Magic-Soaps-Pure-Castile/dp/B00120VWJ0/) ($2.50 for a small 4 oz bottle at my local health food store) - I use this in place of the face and body wash every day. It's going to last me MONTHS at least - it's super concentrated

**EDIT: Deleted the part about exfoliating with baking soda, i won't be doing that again. Does anyone else have an idea for an all natural exfoliator?**

-Pure tea tree oil ($7 at my local health food store) - I mix 1-2 drops of it in my moisturizer every morning. At night before bed, and let it dry.

**EDIT 2: /u/poursalt brings up a good point -- BE VERY CAREFUL to not get either Dr. Bronners tea tree soap or pure tea tree oil in your eyes. It hurts like a mother (much worse than regular soap) and might incapacitate your vision temporarily.**

All in all, and works better. I haven't gotten a single pimple since I started a couple of weeks ago, which is CRAZY. My face is still a little shiny but not NEARLY as bad as it used to be. And have I mentioned my skin hasn't looked this clear since I was a kid!? I honestly did not know my skin could ever look this good again.

The magic ingredient here is clearly tea tree oil, but it doesn't hurt to try. I encourage anyone with acne or shiny face problems to give this a shot :)",,False,self,t5_2vfzu,1367245263.0,,

- Birth control (The only BC they will cover any more will be generic pill BC

- Hormone therapy

He didn't think I would need any heavy disinfecting for my bras (since I was wearing bandages all the time), and a generous amount of detergent. I let them soak for about 30 minutes and then I washed them in my washing machine on the ""handwash"" cycle. If your washing machine doesn't have this cycle, I recommend regularly handwashing them.

1. **Dermatologists are not always the best source.** Most dermatologists specialize in serious skin issues such as skin cancer. Many don't really understand acne as well as you would think. I went through three separate dermatologists who were all considered the top of their practice in my city (a large metropolitan city). But it's usually a painful cycle of trying this anti-biotic then that anti-biotic. Then they'll try whatever prescription creams they can on you as if its just a laundry list. I know too many acne sufferers who wasted their money. *If you choose to go to a dermatologist or any other licensed skin specialist

2. **Quit dairy.** Get your calcium from non-dairy options or vitamins. Milk should be substitued with almond, or dairy-free cheese. Lactose-free dairy products could still be dairy products. 

3. **Regularly change your pillowcase.** This is a VERY important tip! It does make a difference!

4. **Do NOT use face washes and shampoos with sodium lauryl sulfate/sodium laureth sulfate** ammonium lauryl sulfate is okay

5. **Do not overeat eat anything with iodine** This includes certain supplements and seaweed. Iodine triggers acne. 

6. **Birth controls, so ask an expert before using it. 

7. **Use benzoyl peroxide starting with no more than 2.5%

8. **Eat dark chocolate to stop sweet cravings

9. **Use powder face makeup.** Powders as foundation can give adequate coverage and are far less likely to cause breakouts. Liquids and creams are usually too heavy and can clog pores

10. **You MUST wear sunscreen every day, I personally use them. Don't use a moisturizer if your skin is oily, a sunscreen can double as one.  Look for sunscreens with physical blocks, like zinc oxide. Invest in a good sunscreen so you don't spend hundreds on anti-aging products later. ",TIP,False,self,1353607608.0,t3_13lhhk

my story: I've only had one partner, it didn't even hurt the first time and we never even needed lube. Six months in and I got my first expirience with painful sex, he kept talking about how tight I felt while we were doing it so I assumed I was clenching too hard. Time goes by and we started using lube, the sex is only painful occasionally but after a little while it starts becoming painful more often than not, recently it got to the point were it was ALWAYS painful. I still thought I was just clenching too hard because google searches, talking with my BFF, reading posts on /r/sex and my boyfriend all pretty much said that that was the most likely cause. At this point I was *really* stupid to not have gone to a doctor yet, I was totally relaxed, but had had my period start early and spotting occur due to sex before so I thought it was just more of that. Turns out my labia were TEARING during sex, LEARN FROM MY MISTAKES AND DON'T BE AN IDIOT

Also, but it wasn't nearly as scary as I thought it would be! I thought it was going to be a very long, very uncomfortable procedure but it only took a few minutes to get my entire annual exam done. It didn't really feel that uncomfortable physically and my doctor was really good at making me feel comfortable mentally throughout the process, so don't let that get in the way of scheduling an appointment either.  

**TDLR**: I thought I was having painful sex because I was clenching too much and that I could fix the problem by learning how to relax more during sex, and that it wasn't because I was clenching too hard. I wasted a year having painful sex because I thought I knew what was wrong with me when I really didn't and put off going to the doctor because of that, when one trip to the gyno could have had me fixed up within a week.

1) DRY SHAMPOO IS YOUR FRIEND.  I ran out, brush it out and do a little round brush blowdrying and it works for day two and sometimes day 3.  usually day 3 and 4 i concede to hats.

2) Makeup remover and toner.  I loathe washing my face in cold water.  I've been wetting a face cloth and putting it in the microwave occasionally

3)Washing your bits and pits. (and deodorant)  I've been boiling water in my tea kettle and putting it in a large bowl and use a facecloth to wipe down the important parts (armpits and lady parts mostly).  Not showering regularly has been a killer on my girlie bits

4)Do laundry.  I'm pretty bad usually about doing my laundry.  I dont have it in my building and i get lazy with my hectic schedule so i usually just wait till i have one clean pair of underwear left before i have to.  Having fresh clean clothes to put on

5) Do your makeup!!  So it's probably not the best for the skin

I can't imagine i really had any great helpful tips

TL;DR If you cant shower, face cloths, laundry and makeup are your new best friends.

1358402738.0,16ql6x,Mix coconut oil into your shampoo for super soft hair!  The shampoo helps the coconut oil penetrate your hair better.  ,peekoooz,117,16,39,"EDIT:  If anyone tries this

I've posted this in countless comments in various subreddits and people always seem intrigued by it

This is the best tip I've ever gotten for my hair.  It will be most helpful for people with dry hair, limp hair should proceed with caution, but it may be worth a try.  For anyone who already has coconut oil, I highly recommend trying it at least once because it certainly won't hurt your hair.


TL;DR - I mix it into my shampoo. 

I mix melted coconut oil (it may already be liquid in your climate) into my shampoo with about 1 part coconut oil to 3-6 parts shampoo. I started with more, just use much less coconut oil, maybe like 1:10 or less.  Just adjust it to whatever is appropriate for your hair, which may vary some over time.

It sounds a little complicated, it will feel clean, but not stripped. If you use way too much, it will be greasy. You may not even need conditioner anymore, but I use it because it makes my hair easier to comb. I just use Vo5 or Tresemme Naturals.  You should only need a light conditioner if anything. 

For the shampoo in the mix

I microwave the oil to melt it, the mixture is more liquidy than shampoo alone, even though the coconut oil started as a solid, so I squeeze it directly onto my hair with the squeeze bottle because that's easier.




This is by no means ""scientific, shampoo lifts the scales of the cuticle while it's on your hair. Coconut oil is one of few oils that can truly penetrate your hair, as opposed to coating it, I believe because it has shorter fatty acid chains. By mixing the coconut oil into the shampoo, the coconut oil is able to penetrate more effectively while the cuticle is already open. I can't tell you if any of that is actually true, but it makes some sense (if anyone has some legitimate science here, I would love to hear it). Another way to really get the coconut oil into your hair is to do a hot oil treatment with it because heat will also help it penetrate.  

What I can tell you for sure is it improved my hair by leaps and bounds.  So


My hair is wavy, and very thick. I am 3/4 caucasian and 1/4 Japanese. Here are some before and after pictures.

[This was my hair before](http://imgur.com/a/UvQCV) Unfortunately I don't have many pictures because my external hard drive with all my pictures crapped its pants last year. The first 2 are straightened (with a GHD straightener)

And [here is after](http://imgur.com/a/GytqR) All air dried
 
*Additional details about my hair:* My hair wasn't terrible to begin with. It always looked good when I styled it, so that's a huge bonus! Also, even when my hair looked fine, it never felt nice. It was not soft at all, now it is incredibly soft. And those pictures of my hair now are air-dried, not styled. That's the best part. My hair looks great without me having to do ANYTHING to it. No styling products, no heat, so that helps even more!


I hope this is useful for some of you :)

1358442728.0,16rdg5,Epilator info!!! Aka- I'M SO HAPPY I BOUGHT ONE!,chouffee,107,18,83,"Ladies- I've been reading a lot about epilators recently. Hair removal is important to most of us. However

My legs and arms are not hairy at all. But- my armpits and bikini/pubic area is a disaster. Honestly, I have 5:00 shadow. You can see every single hair under the skin and it looks like I didn't even bother. When I was younger, two guys I know actually asked me if I ""even bothered shaving?""- yes, I know it's rude, but it did happen and I've been embarrassed since. But I digress....  My bikini line is just as bad, but maybe worse because of the red, swollen bumps that appear after shaving. I have to wear shorts when I go swimming in the summer to a friend's pool or at the beach. And the bikini line hair goes to my thigh

I used to wax my underarms and my bikini line, but since it grows at different rates, a wax grows in within a week of having it done. Also, I can no longer get brazilian waxes because I actually have 3 hairs growin out of one follicle in certain areas and by the time the wax is over, I'm so swollen I can't sit or walk. The swelling lasts for days. Pretty much pointless for ""gettin' some"" after the wax since nothing can go anywhere near my bits.

So- I've read up about epilators. Bought one yesterday (Remington) and just used it on my armpits and bikini area. The hair growth was only 5 days old. (I shaved on Saturday night)

Yeah- it hurt like a bitch- but only for a few seconds on each area. The entire time I did it, look how pretty and easy this is!)

So, I highly recommend it. The pain is only for a few seconds, but that's how long it takes to remove the hair. Like a wax, once it's done, the pain is done and the area is smooth and pretty. I wish I would've known about this sooner. I've only ever felt confident the first time I'm waxed for the season, but the hair grows back quickly and since the hair I have grows way far down, I can't wait for another wax in the summer. I only get one a year. This epilator can be used as soon as the hair grows in and I'm stoked. 

**TL;DR**  Buy and epilator if you have thick

**EDIT**  This is the one I purchased: [Remington](http://www.amazon.com/Remington-EP6025-Recharegeable-Epilator-Attachment/dp/B003H6FPVI/ref=sr_1_1?s=hpc&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1358453191&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=epilators)

I usually treat with Abreva and try to up the l-lysine in my diet. L-Lysine is an essential amino acid and is often included in many cold sore treatments

Foods high in lysine
**margarine
yogurt
most cheese and dairy
fish(especially flounder)
most poultry and meats
mangoes

Studies show that people who have contracted herpes simplex and have a diet high in Arginine tend to have more outbreaks. When you feel the tingling and itching in your normal spot

Therefore
**most nuts
Most seeds
Grains
Jello
Chocolate**


[this resource](http://www.traditionaloven.com/tutorials/l-lysine_rich_foods.html) is great if you're unsure how much lysine and Arginine are in the foods you're eating. Some experts also recommend upping your vitamin C and E intake during an outbreak to help aid health and healing.

During an outbreak, wash your hands often, and don't share makeup, drinks, utensils, or food. For instance, I contracted the virus when a friend of mine was using my lip balm and didn't tell me she was healing from a cold sore. Shit sucks like that! 

Other options for treatment are prescription topicals provided by your doctor. But remember

I love using outbreaks as a time to rock a bold lip. Lots of bright red lipstick! It helps hide the redness of the cold sore and I get compliments left and right. People don't even notice I have a cold sore!

4. Try not to brush your hair when it's wet. It's really soft when wet and is more likely to break when pulled at and brushed. If you really want to, try not to brush your hair too often.
5. When drying your hair, twist it up and let it sit on top of your head for about 5 min.
6. Leave-in conditioners. Especially when your hair is still damp. Then (if you want to use a comb) use the comb to spread the leave-in conditioner through your hair.

I am among many of you as a sufferer of KP

* Cold, this is great for your hair to make it shiny and silky.

* Don't shower everyday. If you must

* If you wear makeup

* Instead of lotion, moisturizes like mad, and leaves a light sweet scent. If you can't find coconut oil, look for tubs of Eucerin. It is sent from the skin gods, though expensive.

* For a face scrub since I have dry skin

* I use hypo-allergenic everything- from laundry detergent to body wash. I like to think this helps keep my skin clear

* Something a lot of people don't do because of the extra time it takes is PAT DRY with a dry towel after you step out of the shower. Rubbing can scrape your skin in ways it shouldn't be. 

* Within 3 minutes of patting dry

* Don't load up on fatty foods; even my dry skin hated it when I tried the lo carb diet. I've never had so many zits before. Thus

* Drink lots of water. And wear a light sunscreen at all times. I cover my skin as best I can when possible. When I can't or don't want to

I tried to draw what it looks like in Paint, understand it. Someone in the other thread asked if it looked like cauliflower, and I guess that's it. The white part is the layer that is covering and the black is the small hole that I can kind of see behind it.

On some of the websites I read, it doesn't, I guess the word would be open. It's not penetrable, it's just a layer over across.



It would take me a bit to gather some courage

Do I go to my regular doctor? I have to go there soon anyway to get some warts removed. Do I just casually mention it? ""Oh, do you think you could look at my hymen? I think it might be septate, and I can't get a tampon in."" Would I have to go to a hospital for surgery?

I thought I would share something that has saved my life multiple times. I regularly get bladder infections even when using all the precautions...cranberry pills, wiping front to back (duh) and I was sick of waiting at the doctors every time I felt one coming on. I understand that they're are many occurrences where medicine/antibiotics are required but if there's a way I can take care of it myself, hallelujah! This is where I discovered alka seltzer. It tastes absolutely horrendous, but 2 tablets dissolved in water morning and at night for 3 days with TONS of water ( like you should with any bladder infection)  will completely alleviate any pain, allowing your body to fight off the infection by itself like its designed to do. As soon as i have my first glass any pain while urinating is gone within the hour. The alka seltzer neutralizes the pH in your urine, which stops that 'burning' feeling. Since then my bladder infections have seriously diminished, never had any kidney infections or worsening bladder infections.  Hope this helps somebody! Always go with what you're comfortable with!

1353160591.0,13cn5o,[TIP] Skincare ultimate guide! I'll share mine if you share yours. Warning: wall of text.,spacemermaid,75,10,46,"To all the acne/skin issues sufferers
(about me: I have fairly sensitive
  
1. If you can have insurance/can afford it, prescriptions and knowledge about what will make your skin healthy! Additionally, if you think your acne is more hormonal, see your regular doctor and potentially an endocrinologist.  A lot of the time, skin issues are more than just surface problems.   

2. When it comes to skincare, Cetaphil, Purpose.  Basically, you don't want to be irritating your face with extra nonsense if you are going to be medicating it otherwise.  It took me forever to realize that I was making my skin way worse by adding on more stuff to my skincare routine.  Pare back your routine to the bare minimum of things that work, and then DON'T CHANGE IT unless it stops working!     

3. Get rid of alcohol based toners.  Seriously, but they also make your face WAY more greasy, so you think you need more toner.  You do not need toner!  I have heard that alcohol-free witch hazel is nice to use, but haven't tried it myself.  

4.  If you have a lot of facial hair, or try an alternate method for hair removal like laser (warning: expensive!).  

5. Sunscreen/moisturizer!  Definitely get a good

6.  Eye makeup removal: Use oil!  You can use one or a combination of olive oil, sweet almond oil, coconut oil and other similar oils with a q-tip or cotton ball, and use it to swab off eye makeup.  It works wonderfully and has the benefit of being really good for moisturizing the skin around your eyes.  

7.  Allergies.  It took me a really long time to realize that I was having skin issues because I was allergic to certain ingredients in skin products.  Sometimes you never can figure out what is irritating you, cut back on products and start over to try to figure it out.  Also, it is possible that food allergies can trigger acne.    Dairy and wheat/gluten are pretty common offenders, and I know that vitamins with fish oil or DHAs make me breakout immediately.     

8. Exfoliation.  Depending on what treatment you may or may not be using, you may want to be careful with over exfoliating, since these chemicals will cause exfoliation on their own.  If you don't use those types of chemicals, physical exfoliation is a great way to slough off dead skin and keep your pores clean and clear.  You hear awesome stuff about the Clarisonic (a spinning brush thing), but that is expensive! There are a million cheap knockoffs of it that will do pretty much the same thing.  I have the Olay version of this and I love it!  A more low tech and even cheaper way to exfoliate is with a [Buf Puf](http://solutions.3m.com/wps/portal/3M/en_US/Buf-Puf/Home/).    

9.  The Heavy Hitters!! Note that many of these products can make your skin itchy/dry for maybe up to a week when you first start using them

* AHA - alpha hydroxy acid.  Well-known AHAs include lactic acid, dry skin.  They unclogs pores, and actually help to moisturize your skin, plus you can use them when you are pregnant.  Note that it can sting a little.  

* BHA - Beta hydroxy acid. AKA Salicylic Acid - also why crushed up aspirin helps zits (it's the same ingredient).  Similar to AHAs

* Benzoyl Peroxide - Benzoyl peroxide works as a peeling agent. It increases skin turnover, like salicylic acid or with retinoids.  Note that you should probably not use this during pregnancy, but some doctors say it is ok.  

* Retinoids - These are chemical compounds based on vitamin A. There are three ""generations"" of them, tretinoin (retinoic acid, Retin-A), isotretinoin, and alitretinoin; the second generation retinoids: which include etretinate and its metabolite acitretin; and finally the third generation retinoids: which include tazarotene, bexarotene and Adapalene.  These guys speed up cell turnover and strip the top layer off your face, making you look glowy and lovely and zit and wrinkle free. Love this stuff!  You can't use this when you are pregnant.  

* Oral antibiotics.  There are a million different versions of these, and that's not good.  I guess certain types of acne are more about the infection under the skin rather than what is going on at the the surface, so these fight acne from the inside.  If you have a special event for which you NEED a perfect face, see the dermatologist and ask for these!  I don't think they are great for long term use, but they can really knock down a bad skin condition and give you a good starting point for other treatments.  Can't be used during pregnancy!

1355028324.0,14j8di,Thought about getting a Clarisonic? Here's my personal experience!,,68,9,52,"Hey everyone, but it's a wonderful luxury regardless of skin type.

ANYWAY.

I have skin from hell. I suffered with cystic acne for years, my pores are huge, and I'm highly sensitive to harsh temperatures and stress. Many of these problems run in my family. In fact, my aunt gets biweekly facials and is still fading pockmarks and scars from her teenage years.


Since before I was a teenager, over-the-counter products, and natural remedies. I have tried many effective products and helped many others with their skin, so I know what works for many different skin types. [I'll do another post about acne remedies when I'm not so busy with finals, and will post a link here!].


Thankfully, with a slightly worse breakout in the week before my period is due. Still annoyed with my pores, acne scars, and general unevenness of my skin, I purchased a Clarisonic Mia in the spring this year (sometime in mid-April).
- http://www.clarisonic.com/shop/sonic_skin_cleansing_systems/sonic_skin_cleansing_system_mia/index.php?sku1=100140

I recommend buying from an authorized seller or the website itself


I started using this product very slowly. I used it once a day, then started using it twice a day. This is very important because this brush tends to ""purge"" your skin, and can really cause a breakout at first. By easing into the use, you're minimizing the extent of this ""purge"".


You can use it with any cleanser you want


This brush has accelerated the fading of my acne scars and has minimized the appearance of my pores (they're mostly clear, they breakouts are typically not cystic &amp; go away relatively quickly. My skin has more of a glow and I LOVE washing my face!


Ask away; I'll be happy to respond with any questions! Will edit if there's a popular question.

My experience with the Tanda Zap has been incredible.  The tool functions by battery (included with the one I bought).  You press the button and it vibrates and lets out a blue LED light.  You lightly press it on the culprit and the tool automatically turns off after two minutes.

You can use this thing on a zit 2-3 times a day.  I have found that it causes the zit to come to the surface after just one day.  After each treatment I gently wipe that bad boy with toner on a cotton pad and the thing just pops itself!  The zit completely flattens out and is gone in one to two days!

You can easily clean the tool with a cotton ball and rubbing alcohol.  I clean it every time right before I use it.  You get 1000 treatments out of one tool. 

This thing is fucking amazing and I highly recommend it!

1364389999.0,1b3w04,Stoked on this natural deodorant!,whatuppanda,68,14,23,"Hey GSG!

Someone in 2x suggested I post this here. 

I've been having major success with [Dr. Mist](http://www.drmist.us/) deodorant. I got it at the health food store (in Canada)

I work at a hot ass dry cleaner and am surrounded by irons, red armpits from my anti-perspirant (Dove Original), which I've been using since forever. Dr. suggested I switch to a natural deodorant without alcohol. I've tried many and been disappointed or reacted to them.

Dr. Mist is dead sea minerals, leaving the salts, which neutralize the bacteria. There's also a fragrance-free option. It sprays on like water, you rub it in, and it takes a minute or two to dry (kind of annoying, but I'll deal).

The results? After working hard and sweating all day, when I was just running errands and hanging out, I had no wetness and no odour. 

In Canada, or health food stores. In the States, I think you have to order it online through the website or Amazon. I paid $8 CAD. A bit hefty, but worth it IMO.

Anyway

If you've tried it or have another natural deo you like

Happy Wednesday!

1368168021.0,1e20tj,[Request] How do I avoid stains on panties during that time of the month?,lehmongeloh,54,7,65,"Does anyone else have that problem?  It seems like no mater what I'm wearing be it some form of tampon or pad (or sometimes a combination of tampon and panty liner) I always have this problem.  I have a special drawer for underwear I don't care about specifically for this reason because sometimes I can't hand wash the stains out entirely.  

This month has been particularly bad and it's making me frustrated.  I check quite often to make sure everything is in order and change out pads/tampons often so I know it's not an issue of being ""too full"".  I've also switched brands thinking that might help.   Nights are the worst because I move around a lot and in the morning I can wake up with stains in ridiculously high places that the pad doesn't cover.  I feel like the biggest idiot right now.  -_-  

I'm just wondering if anyone else has any tricks.  Or of anyone else has this problem so I feel like less of an idiot.  I'm visiting my boyfriend for a month soon and I'd rather not have to face the ""oh my god please don't tell me I've stained his white sheets"" terror when I wake up every morning until my period ends.  (Because *of course* my period always happens when I visit him no matter what time of the month I visit.)

Today I got a full leg wax and full brazilian at a beauty salon that was recommended to me by a close friend who swears by it.

First of all, disposable applicator every time the esthetician dips back into the wax. At this place, she was using a metal one and dipping back into the same pot every time.

So it could be that every customer gets their own pot, but still, thoughts? 

Also, but she didn't use gloves. She often kept the cloth strip between her hands and my skin, but still, is this safe?

I'm kind of upset about having these doubts because the place is actually decently priced and otherwise I had a good experience. The final result was great and felt easy. I hope I'm being paranoid.

Anyway, shot, ring, and IUD. I got pregnant with my daughter while religiously taking the mini-pill, and got my IUD 6 weeks after her birth (during a time where I was breastfeeding and hormonal anyway).

My body doesn't know what to do with itself! I'm breaking out into so much acne its absurd, non-processed hormone life!? I've been on BC since I was 16...

Help me out

EDIT: Thank you so much for all the help, but it's been a weird week.

I have noticed that, political topics. If you have a question about the abortion process, I ask that you either refer to the original thread on the topic or ask a professional. The comments became heated and I don't want unnecessary controversy.

Also, the original thread on abortion will not be removed. However, any future posts concerning abortion will be removed. Note: this does not include birth control threads.

Thank you for your cooperation and I apologize for any inconvenience.

I currently live in upstate NY about 60 miles north of Manhattan. Today I was contacted about an employment opportunity in my field at an office in lower Manhattan. This is super exciting for a bunch of reasons

So here come the fears. This is WAAY out of my comfort zone. I'm an upstate girl from the 'burbs. I've never even ridden the subway alone...  yes, would mean I'd be devoting 12 hours a day 5 days a week to this job. That's no joke! Like I said, they would be compensating me enough to cover the cost of my commute and put more money in my pocket at the end of the week than I make now, but I still feel like that's a huge amount of time.

So here I am. Honestly

UPDATE: So first off, whom was very optimistic about bringing me on the team, but after speaking with the absentee owner of the company the owner decided he doesn't want to bring in any new people at the moment but instead focus on refining the team he has. So unfortunately that leaves me out of the equation. I was really bummed this morning (a few tears were shed) but after thinking about it I'm still glad this all happened. It has shown me how much I really want to get out there and move on to bigger things in new and exciting places. So thank you all for your kind words!

I have tried everything from shaving (via razor), though, as having to wait for full regrowth in order to wax can be inconvenient.     

The problem is, because I will have the nagging feeling that my unkempt state is very visible. Now this problem is sometimes solved by a good waxing after the hairs have grown a while but, with summer being here, I don't have the luxury to wait.     

So I have several questions:    
-  Is it a fault of the epilator that it doesn't always give a very close shave? (mine is about 4 years old, 'till then, I have to make due with this baby)    
-  At what ""moment"" of the ""post shave growth saga"" of your leg hair are you unwilling to wear something that reveals the bare legs anymore? (and proceed to shave again)

Okay, seems pretty open to all issue female so I thought this would be a good place to have my melt down. The apartments I'll be moving into seem pretty okay, but definitely lower income and though they're gated, the surrounding neighborhood could be better. Some of my future co-tenants seem a little questionable too. I know I'm judging a lot based off first appearances and that's stupid of me, but I'm nervous! I really like the place and it seems very quiet really. They do have a patrol at night too...
Honestly
But part of my issue is that I feel like I'm supposed to be tougher about this. I did all the work to find this place, I'm in the Army National Guard(just got back from a deployment to Afghanistan too!), I kinda feel like my friends and family expect me to not get scared and cry or anything because of that. I should be the soldier not the young girl. I should laugh off threats cause I know how to handle myself. I should be more confident in everything because I'm slightly more mature, worldly, whatever than other's my age.
So I guess I feel like I can't bother them with this
I'm not dumb, more locks or a wooden bat and/or cast iron skillet), I got all of that worked out. But I'm just worried about all of the ""what if's"" that my over imaginative mind can create. 
What if I don't like myself enough to be alone all of the time? Should I even try to make friends or stick to myself completely? I'm honestly not too agressive all that much, I'm worried I'll take too long either recognize the slowly growing threat or that I wont know how to handle it and just try to ignore something that I should totally handle ASAP. 
I'm being very silly, I am pretty sure I can find somebody I trust to come hang around enough for the monsters under my bed to vanish.

tl;dr I was confused and was asking questions which lovely members answered. 

I'm writing this to not only thank everyone who has given me their advice

Firstly
She gave me the option to have it done that day or (which she highly recommended) come back when I was on day three of my cycle and she will prescribe me a numbing agent to help with the pain.  
That's what I did.  She told me that doing it on day three of your cycle allows for easier insertion.  This is because you're already somewhat crampy (depending on the severity of your cramps.. Mine are 10/10 excruciating - just what the Mirena helps with).  Day three (also depending on your cycle) shouldn't be too heavy. 
She gave me a prescription (which I can't remember what it's called right now, numbed the top of my stomach to the middle of my thighs, and I had mild cramps.  However, I have no doubt that it helped the procedure.
The day of the procedure (today) I took four pain killers about a half an hour before going to the appointment.  The doctor told me to take as many as I did for my regular cycle cramps (again, doesn't hurt but it's just uncomfortable.  The doctor then measured how long my vagina was and that's where I really started to cramp.  I can't say it wasn't painful, but it was just like my regular cramps (just a bit worse) and it only lasted a few seconds.  She then inserted the IUD and I honestly didn't even notice.  I'm sure at the time I did, but it was really quick.  The whole procedure took five minutes.  The doctor left about 1cm of string to allow me to get use to it and check to make sure it stays in place.  She said if it bothered me or my SO, then just to come in and she'll cut it.  She then set up an ultrasound in a months time and I was off.
My SO drove us home (which I recommend just because I did have cramps and wouldn't have wanted to drive or take the bus). Don't get me wrong

The total cost for the whole procedure was: Mirena $422.75 + Numbing agent (with insurance) $5.04 = $427.79

1354888989.0,14fz9v,[TIP] Implanon Birth Control,MsHellsing,31,3,18,"Hey ladies - last year

Anyhow, in my humble opinion, is awesome! I walked into my doctor's office and said, ""I need the birth control that gives me great skin and helps me lose weight!"" thinking I'd be funny and ironic. My doctor totally came through. 

To give you a balanced idea

- Had a big issue regulating my emotions at first (to be fair it wasn't long before I was going through a break up so that might have had something to do with it).
- There was random spotting that was difficult to predict but never a lot and never for long.
- It takes a week to get used to the thing in your arm, but you can feel it under your skin if you run your fingers over it. I offer to let people touch it all the time!)

The Pros:

- After the initial mood swings
- After the spotting period
- I don't have to remember to take anything and it's in my arm
- Zero weight gain issues (I fluctuate naturally with my sweet tooth but I've been eating well and exercising and don't have any problems taking weight off).
- No monthly bloating or mood swings. 
- I've been fortunate enough to not really have had any severe skin issues pre birth control

The process itself of getting it inserted was crazy simple - they numb the area on the inside of your non dominate upper arm

So far I have zero regrets. For what I paid after insurance (about $99)

Where do I begin? I'll start by saying I have PCOS (Polycystic ovary syndrome) because I feel like that might mean something? My periods have always been once every two or three months

Fast forward to this year when I became sexually active and decided to start birth control (NuvaRing). The first three months were good, I knew things would be a little off with the change. This month is different. The day before I took the ring out for the break week, I started getting this very thick, DARK brown discharge that I have never had before. It lasted for more than a week and I just figured that maybe it was my body getting used to the nuva ring and that would be my period for that month. Although when my period started, after I inserted the new ring might I add, I was a little confused but didn't worry much about it. Well that whole thing started on June 9th!

**My Skin TL;DR:**

*  I would still describe my skin as relatively balanced

*  I get lots of whiteheads/deeper junk around my chin (never red acne though)

*  Lately I've been getting one small red zit after another


I'm very good about leaving angry zits them alone or cleansing them safely and appropriately


I have read [this wonderful post](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1a1cj3/everything_you_wanted_to_know_about_ocm_the_oil/) about the OCM, but clearing up my skin is number one.  After reading through the descriptions of every one of the oil options, I have narrowed it down to these:

*  **Baobab Oil**: absorbs quickly, very rich and stable

*  **Black Raspberry Seed**: light, antioxidant

*  **Brazil Nut Oil**: conditioning

*  **Candela Infused Oil**: regenerative, promotes circulation

*  **Camellia Oil (Olferia)**: excellent skin and hair conditioning properties, helps to diminish fine lines, nice and light weight, emollient

*  **Hazelnut Oil**: slightly astringent, tightens skin, maintains firmness and elasticity of skin, helps to strengthen capillaries, encourages cell regeneration, stimulates circulation

*  **Jojoba Oil Gold**: dissolves sebum and limits oil production in oily skin, not greasy and sinks right into skin

*  **Meadowfoam Oil**: one of the best oils to prevent moisture loss, adds shine and nourishment to hair, very stable

*  **Passion Fruit/Marajuca Oil**: antibacterial

*  **Tamanu Oil**: emollient, analgesic, softening


Should I consider something like Flax Seed Oil or Chardonnay Grapeseed Oil for the somewhat oilier skin I've been dealing with?  Or the pH-restoring effects of Pomegranate Oil?  Anyone had experiences with some of the more uncommon ones here?  Good experiences with something else I didn't mention??  *I'm just really struggling.

The last few times I had my period it was really quite bad but I wasn't sure if it normal, not too light, and I occasionally get cramps but I usually pop a pill on the first day and it goes unnoticed.

However, the day before it starts and for the first 2 days, it feels as if I am dying. In a matter of minutes I go from feeling fine, to feeling like I am dead exhausted, my head kinda hurts, I am incredibly thirsty, I feel like I have literally no nutrients inside me and I just want to sleep for 3 days straight.

The couple friends I've reached out to about opinions over the IUD have resulted in bad reviews. The few ladies I've contacted through other internet resources have been very outspoken about how awful of an experience it was. I read yet another story in this subreddit about something going awry.

As I sit here... or rather awkwardly switch between sitting and standing to alleviate the pressure on my lady parts... I am starting to worry that something is off about the statistics. The only people I've heard positive reviews from were the clinicians I was talking to when preparing to get an IUD.

Surely there have to be more women who have IUDs and lived happily ever after

I would love, how long did it take for you to feel ""normal"" and not concerned over whether or not you'd have something go terribly, terribly wrong? What are some things I should be prepared for? What were some things that surprised you about the IUD (good or bad)? I dunno... share with me your experiences with getting used to something in your uterus!

I don't have many proper outlets for girl talk and would appreciate the company and comfort of ladies who can understand the concern I have.

I've been told by a few hairstylists that I have a surprising amount of hair because the individual strands themselves are not that thick

Normally I style my hair by just blow drying it by flipping my head upside down and using a brush to comb through the length. I try not to get to close to the hair or my roots with the blow dryer and I use Kiehls heat protective silk straightening cream religiously and highly recommend it. I love doing my hair this way because i like the volume and the straightness of my hair. I tend to leave it down longer before it gets annoying and all in my face and I end up putting it up in a ponytail or messy bun (part of the problem).

The problem is I've become more conscious of the health of my hair and would like to take better care of it. One issue is that the ends of my hair tend to get knotted and tangled pretty easily

My hair also gets really oily and greasy really quickly. I wash my hair usually every other day (admittedly sometimes even longer), I just switch to a messy bun. I've tried several dry shampoos but honestly, they all just seem to make it worse (the greasiness and they also make it way more knotted). 

Now the main issue I'm having is trying to let my hair dry naturally. I just hate the way it ends up looking after a shower. Since my hair is pretty long already, and I just think it looks so messy and unattractive. It could be perfectly tangle free and yet look like I didn't brush it all day and just woke up like that and left it. Because of this, I usually hardly ever leave it down when I wash it and like to keep it in a bun (big surprise. it's my favorite hairdo apparently). How can I style it so it looks nice when I dry it naturally, and so I don't have to blow dry it every time I dry my hair? Also what can I do to keep my hair from getting so oily? Any types of  shampoos/conditioners/leave-in conditioners you can suggest would be helpful. And any other easy style tips in general?

* The usual medication prescribed (Reglan) is associated with cases of tardive dyskensia. Instead of relying on medication (and I know that for many

* With a low fiber diet

* Figure out your triggers as soon as possible! For everyone

* Laying on your side after a meal can help empty your stomach.

* If my digestion is slow

* When dealing with social interactions where I am pressured to eat things I should not eat

* Even though it can be very hard to muster the energy and enthusiasm to exercise

* Find a helpful doctor who either has a lot of experience with gastrointestinal illnesses or has the willingness to learn.

1351918749.0,12jx5a,Homemade Skin Care,GeneticImprobability,24,3,3,"I have this hobby. It involves making my own skincare products. It makes my boyfriend look at me like I'm crazy. I will share my knowledge with you.

**Tip #1:** Someone else has already sung the praises of baking soda here, though - you want the foaming interaction between the acid and base substances, not a neutral solution. Mix it up right before you use it, and you'll have a nice, acne-clearing scrub. It's a fantastic exfoliant for blackheads and, depending on the pressure you use, it can polish you up like old silver, I've heard that long-term use of lemon juice can lighten marks on the skin leftover from the ghosts of pimples past (or what have you). Sensitive-skinned folk should exercise caution

**Tip #2:** Rice flour is your friend. You can buy it finely-ground from the store and it'll be great for your skin just as it is. However, but very little effort, and I bet a lot of you have rice (not the quick-cooking kind!) sitting in your cupboard. I'm not sure exactly why it's good for your skin, but I do know it leaves your face smooth and slightly moisturized, and I know I see an improvement when I use it consistently. Feels good, man. Those with sensitive skin might want to go with storebought for the finer, less abrasive texture.

**Tip #3:** Oatmeal can face (**GET IT??**) and conquer a host of epidermal evils. You can mix it with honey or yogurt (you heard me) or some other skin-yummy ingredient or use it on its own. If you do that, and run it under some warm water so that it becomes completely moistened. (I know you all love that word, don't you? [Moist](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=apEZpYnN_1g#t=332s) is everyone's favorite word.) Then, you take that goopy, boogery mass sitting in the palm of your hand and you slather it over your face like it's the blood of your enemies. Putting on this and other lumpy face masks originating from the kitchen is usually what makes my boyfriend wonder if he should have me committed. Regardless of how crazy you look, though, it works. Oatmeal can sooth redness, it's an exfoliant gentle enough to use daily

**Tip #4:** Another scrub that's really quick to put together is oil (or cold cream, but I didn't want to leave it out since it's such a nice scrub! This one's not just for your face, either - olive oil and brown sugar are especially nice pre-shaving or for rough knees and elbows. Sugar is good for your skin because it contains alpha-hydroxy acid, or AHA, which... does good stuff. I don't know the particulars. Oil is good for your skin too, as much as that may go against your instincts. Olive oil is one of the more easily accessible ones, but you can get fancy with other skin-friendly oils as well. Which leads me to...

**Tip #5:** Fight oil with oil. It may feel horribly counterproductive to rub a bunch of oil into your greasy skin, it's not. At least, not for most people - I'm sure there are some for whom this wouldn't work, as is almost certainly true of each of these tips. I've found myself mentioning this a lot lately: the Oil Cleansing Method, or OCM. You want castor oil, which is so good at cleansing your skin that it can leave it a little dry, and you also want a carrier oil to take care of moisturizing - that's where you can have fun and adjust to your skin's weird quirks. As I said before, but some might find that it's too heavy, sunflower, and it feels reeaally nice

**Tip #6:** Vinegar isn't just for stain removal. This one is short - you can use apple cider vinegar mixed 50/50 with water (or full-strength, but I've never tried it. Cheap Fred Meyer brand for me, yeah!

**Tip #7:** You can do fun things with papaya. Blending a mixture of papaya fruit, and maybe throwing some honey in there if you've got it, can make a nice face mask. Lime juice can make your skin glow and papaya is softening. I neglected to mention it before, but honey is good for your face because it pulls things out of your pores *and* it's antibacterial, meaning it can kill the proverbial acne-causing bacteria. I suspect its ability to kill tiny organisms is why it never spoils - I read about archaeologists eating some they had excavated in a tomb! But I digress. This mask will also make you look like an asylum outpatient, but it's nice. (Bonus tip: this is a good mask, but it's a GREAT hair mask. I saw a noticeable difference after putting this on my hair.)

That's all I can think of for now, and skin tutorials and she's super sweet! Have fun sitting around with goop on your faces ;]

I haven't gotten it cut or trimmed in over a year and a half so it's nice and long and surprisingly I barely have any split ends.

I usually don't use soap or shampoo because I'm too sensitive so I use baking soda and apple cider vinegar which keeps my hair in awesome shape.

1355460458.0,14tt5y,Painting your nails: Gel manicures are worth it.,Stands_w_Fist,29,9,14,"If you don't paint your nails because of chipping and maintenance

Gel nail polish is a resin that is painted on the nail just like regular polish but instead is set with UV light (usually a minute or two of exposure per coat). A gel manicure set correctly will stick to your nails and NOT chip. Mine usually lasts 3-4 weeks until I take it off and repaint (because new nail grows in and not because the paint chips off).

I hadn't had a manicure in 10 years and popped in to treat myself. I was sold when they told me about long lasting gel manicures. Holy shit. For three weeks, and top coat). My nails never chipped and never did the polish look scuffed or dull; it was a great relief to grow out my nails without worrying about them chipping (as they often break when long)

After one manicure I bought a base coat

Gel polish can only be done with a full manicure procedure, and dry them with a nail-prep solution before you can begin doing coats (which need to set completely). **This no need for an acrylic nail bed for gel manicures, it sets right on your natural nail.** Gel manicures can be a tad tricky to set and do because the outermost layer of the polish will not set because the oxygen in the air prevents it from setting. So you need to be able to judge if gel has set under the tacky wet layer on top. After applying the top coat, you need to remove the tacky outermost layer with a cleaning solution. ALL these gel polish suppliers sell these nail prep and top coat solutions but you should **NEVER** buy these. Regular rubbing alcohol is a chemically equivalent solution that will dry out your nails adequately for the manicure and will remove the tackiness of the top coat without destroying your manicure.

Two major downside to gel polishes:

1. You really do have to love the color you choose because you're stuck with it. I went with a deep red wine color and I would highly recommend gel polish to chicks that don't like to switch colors often or those that don't sweat it if their outfit clashes with their nails.

2. Price. A bottle is about $12/each and you must buy at least the base and top coat for any color you're using. You also need a UV lamp and you should never spend less than $30 on the light.

3. Prep. You need to buff your nails well for the resin to stick,False,self,t5_2vfzu,False,,,t3_14tt5y

I recently moved in to a new place with some new roommates. My roommates are totally awesome--some of the nicest people I've met. They have three dogs, today they made some messes anyways. One of them puked on the stairs, the other one disemboweled a toy. I decided to put the dogs out in the yard so I could clean up easier, and because it was about time for them to relieve themselves anyway.

I had barely opened the door when the two bigger dogs shot out and started barking and some neighbors by their truck. I wrangled the dogs back (got one on a leash, and he doesn't always listen to me right away since he's still in training) so I had to put him back inside. I felt really bad that the dogs kept barking and were trying to run up to the guys in the truck. Even so, the guys were cool about it. After I got the dogs under control and the mess inside cleaned up, they offered a beer and introduced themselves. They were really cool about everything, and understood that one 20-something girl against three dogs is tough.

Almost right after all the introductions, yadda yadda yadda"") and something about the other one, who was her son, and told me something along the lines of ""Oh, it's nice that you live over there with your boyfriend"" (I don't, the guy living with me is just a roommate, and dating the other girl here)  ""and you can have as many dogs as you want, his friend, ""She's just a bitch

Does anyone here have any advice as of what to do? Do I apologize to her for something? I have no idea what I did wrong. The only thing I can think of was the dogs barking today, and fuck me if anything happened to the little girls on behalf of one of the dogs playing rougher than he should. I'm actually really upset about this and crying as I type. I've had plenty of rude/odd roommates and got along smoothly with them even if we didn't necessarily like each other, but I've honestly never lived or dealt with anyone like her, and I've never had any rude neighbors. Aside from I'm really at a loss of what to do. I'm going to be living here for the next few months and I don't want to make any matters worse.

* Fixed my haircut: Very very short on the sides and longer on top.

* Relaxing bath and some skin care (DAT smoothness)

* Too lazy to work out

* Just chill on the porch (I don't know why I don't do this more often)

* Some lovely pet time ([Monti](http://imgur.com/qAbrBDN) and I want to say thank you!)

I never thought such easy things and time for myself could help this much. I realised that right now I have to do things just for myself. We are not two anymore and all that matters is going on and improving myself so

I've had acne in high school and into my twenties (21 now). I've gone to a dermatologist who was useless: did not identify why I kept having acne, friends, etc., but it usually kept either super drying my skin and then super oiling it. Eventually my doctor told me i have a hormone imbalance which causes my acne (among other unpleasant things). I kept using the same products that would dry the pimples and then moisturize my skin (told by dermatologist). Most recently I finally started birth control (almost one month).
My acne has stopped being severe but now I have red patches of skin that have flaking skin. I moisturize 3 or 4 times a day with Nivea facial cream but I have no idea what to do. I only have this on my face. It used to occasionally appear around my nostrils but it was usually in the winter. Then it started under my mouth. Now its my nose, and most recently a part of my forehead. I moisturize it like crazy. It helps keep away the look of the flakes, but it is still red and the flakes come back in an hour or so. It feels like I will never have normal skin no matter what. What the heck is this and what do I do??

-Morning: Rinse skin with cold water

-Throughout the day: Use oil blotter sheets

What do ye wear?
How do ye cope in the wind and the rain?
How do ye cope with possible feminism issues that may arrise?
Any tricks? :)


Here are some tips and tricks I've learned over the years:

*1) rain pants saved my presentation. Pack 'em and thank 'em later.

*2) assume that no-one actually knows how to drive. When in doubt

*3) I went through a bad patch of having eczema on my face

*4) along with your lights, oil and what not, the cable ties are hand if your pannier/bag breaks, while the nail varnish can quickly seal scratches in your bike to prevent rush and fix the ladders on your tights should you have had a fall.

*5) If I don't want to be sweaty arriving

*6) if you're like me

*7) I have panniers but I don't use them

*8) for god's sake, you're ensuring you and everyone in your vicinity is that little bit safer. I hear good things about fluro vests, but I am skeptical!

I've always moisturized heavily before and after sun exposure so I'm really not sure how this stuff would work to get a darker suntan!

I've been using menstrual cups for about 5-6 years. I started out with a Diva Cup in high school and tossed that out after I dropped it in a very unhygienic area. (I always hated how hard the material was, I went swimming regularly in high school with no issues.

I switched to a Yuuki after that and it's been about 3 years now. It's softer and shallower - overall more comfortable. (I decided to order it after perusing the LJ community's posts. Wasn't sure about how much I bled

**So my problem** is that I always have to wear pantiliners when I use my cup because there is always blood leaking out. I can feel it as surely as I would if I were using only pads. This definitely wasn't the case when I first got the Yuuki. I make sure there's a seal by tugging lightly on it and the holes are always cleaned out before I reinsert. In fact, and it's not due to overflow (I am on BC and have medium-to-light flow), so what could the problem be? Has the cup just somehow worn out? (I thought these were supposed to last for ~5-10 yrs in order to be cost effective.) Maybe it just doesn't fit my body that well?
