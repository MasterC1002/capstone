I have a secret to tell you. I was meditating the other day in a coffee shop (it must have looked like I was napping). I was contemplating emptiness. I was sitting just right there

I want you to know that I pass through a lot of my life afraid. Often about little things. I’m always on my guard. I see the same people every day, so I never do. We don’t really know each other. In a way, you already know me much better than they do.

-----

It's pitch black. My eyes are closed. The only sounds I hear are the odd shuffling of feet, or is the shaman glowing? ... trick question, I suppose.

Twenty minutes. The woman is singing. It sends a shiver down my spine that coalesces into a hum. Oh. Ooohhh. My limbs are happy. This. I dance in my seat.

Thirty minutes. Faint twisting twirling dervishes of color and intangible form

What are you? I mean... what. The fuck **are** you?

&gt;**I am ayahuasca. You drank me.**

How... old are you?

&gt;**What a funny question.**

... why are you speaking in my own voice?

&gt;**You know why.**

Oh

&gt;**Precisely. So what brings you here?**

... you know what.

&gt;**That's the spirit.**

Why am I seeing this sort of tunnel? Everything is exponentially slamming together

&gt;**That's us.**

That's time? 

&gt;**Yes. Would you like to see more?**

I dunno... last time I saw infinity

&gt;**You can do anything.**

Fair enough.

... holy shhh

And it does that over and over? Forever? The universe is nothing but a fucking feedback loop of expansion and contraction?

&gt;**Not necessarily. Look more.**

It's... speeding up. It's neither expansion nor contraction.

&gt;**That's humans. That's now. Let's go back to that in a minute. I want to talk about you.**

___ minutes. It is now now o'clock. I hear my fellow humans retching. Splatter. We invented buckets. I'm pleased that I haven't purged yet. I see so many things.

I see me. I see my masturbation. I see my expressions. I see my obfuscations. I see my misunderstandings. I see my problems and my potentials, checking up on me in the middle of the night when I was seven. Now I'm raising a son of my own. I watch him grow from a baby to a teenager in thirty seconds. It's so obvious. 

I can do anything.

&gt;**Correction: You can do *anything*.**

And... I already knew that. 

&gt;**Yes.**

How did I forget? Why the FUCK did I forget? 

&gt;**Don't feel guilty. You're fine.  
Wanna hear a joke?**

What?

&gt;**Knock knock.**

... OH GHUUUUAAAAAAGGHGHHHGHGHG

Splatter. Spit. Repeat. I laugh so hard. I laugh SO hard. I'm a madman in a room full of seekers. Splatter. The beautiful music is contrasted with the sounds of so many digestive upheavals. 

&gt;**Pretty good
We are infinite. Each and all of us together. We are the ancient cosmic story. We will never ever die. Not truly. Because there is only this. There is only this. Your body will disintegrate, your hopes, your accomplishments, the happiness you will create and have created, the love you've inspired, the community you foster will never die. You and I are not separate from infinity, silly. That's why it's infinity. You're an integral, consequential part of it.**

It's so funny. It's so simple. I see Bill Hicks and Hunter S. Thompson. I see Terence. We were all right. It's love. It's love. It's love. I feel the shaman's hand on the top of my head. I place my hand on his. It's love. 

&gt;**It's love. And I love you. This next part is gonna be rough.**

I see the inspiration behind every visionary artwork ever made. I see my body stretched through infinite potentialities. I stumble in my seat. I feel like I'm dying. As soon as I make the effort to sit back up

I love them.

I'll wrap it up here: It was fucking amazing. I saw my potential, but that's the fun, isn't it? I can let go into oblivion, or climb through complexity and greater complexity, therefore enabling greater complexity through my very existence and persistence. I don't need to worry, ever. It might be true that this is just a ride... but really, it just IS. And this is it. 

We as humans can escape our biological shells to become star-hopping architects of ever-increasing potentiality

I think ayahuasca is the anti-virus. Most of life (on this planet, though: We don't need to. We can all help each other to become the best we can be - which is infinite. And the more we bring along, the more THEY bring along, and the closer to a higher infinity we all become. Exponential. 

10/10 would drink again, instead of misguided humans who don't know what they're doing - because they exist.

**Edit 5:**  [Here is the second audio file.](http://soundcloud.com/psychonaut18/the-voice-first-contact_2)  To give some context, and then we return to our smoke spot.  He tells me he's slipping away again, and doesn't understand.  I tell him it's alright, and just to go with it.  He falls silent again.  After a minute or two of silence I ask ""Where are you?"" to which he responded ""Hello, Eric"" in that assured, steady cadence that is so unlike his normal way of speaking. I hit record again, and we continue talking for a few more minutes, and also worry about keeping Connor out so late.  He wakes Connor up again.  The next day I told Connor what happened, and plans for all of this

**Edit 4:**  As requested, and upload the rest of the audio and text as I go.  I will try to respond to as many of you as I can, and give any more information you'd like to know.

**Edit 3:**  It's Saturday morning now and I'm working to get this finished.  I've posted the next bit of transcript as a reply to my last post, I know this sounds unbelievable, it took us a long time to stop doubting it ourselves).

**Edit 2:**  I've posted the first part of the audio transcript in the comments

**Edit:**  Thank you guys for reading, as it's just a cell phone recording in a running vehicle, and I feel it would be better to get it down in writing anyway.

**Start here:**

First off, I took notes as fast as I could.  All I ask is that at least *one* of you reads this, and tells me what you think.  So far very few people believe what I've told them, but I feel like you guys may be more open to it, given the nature of this subreddit.  This is the first time I've ever shown someone these notes in their near entirety.  

**TL;DR A voice inhabited the body of my friend

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Connor will not remember any of this

Many of you have the right idea, Allah, anything under the sun, they are all worshipping the same thing.  You are a part of something greater than you can ever imagine and people fantasize about what it is.  What these religions all have in common is the gods they are worshipping are all the same God.  God is everything.  All of them, the entire world, is a labyrinth of your own thought rocketing outward in every direction.  Everything you see.

There is a law of the universe that states that nothing is created nor destroyed.  Your scientists have it right.  Think of it this way: silly putty.  The world, and these silly puddies are all part of one massive silly putty.  All your world is is the shifting of this clay statue.  The statue's appearance are all different interpretations of what one speculates it to be.  That is the purpose of your life.  You are one of an infinite number of interpretations of what it means to be God, trying to figure out what you are.

The big bang is god splitting in two like an atom, creating a separate universe opposite him.  She wanted to experience herself.  You wanted to experience this as well.  The meaning of life is to understand who you really are.  Connor has his own interpretations, so do you.  The things you hate in others are the fears you see about yourself.  The fears you see in [your coworker] are the fears you see about yourself.  Your friends are the things you love about yourself.  Humanity must love unselfishly and realize that everything around him is himself.  

Everything being here by coincidence is your greatest fear

This is the only game in town.  This is the only thing you are able to do, but that is all that it is.  The big bang is the great breath of everything that You are.  Of everything You ever are.  And it keeps happening over and over, which is why when you look at a grain of sand, you can continue to look so deeply that it looks nothing like the way you originally perceived it.  It becomes the universe.  You see, everything just goes over and over and over, and you are in your own bubbles.  

You cannot feel it.  You cannot feel your consciousness driving through space and time and many of you are ignorant of it.  They feel comfort in ""who they are"".  Television, these things give them a slight break.  A feeling away from experiencing your purpose.  Many of you feel this way.  Eric, you of all people know this.  You have spoken to us several times, but because of your inability to filter out the noise, no one can speak back.  What you can't hear is the truth you have come to fear, and like many of your brothers and sisters you're realizing that just because you are questioning is a clue that you are finally starting to understand the Game.  Because that's all it is, it's just a game.  Many of your brothers and sisters know this.  Many more think they might.

[I ask how he is able to communicate with me through Connor.]

[something about the labyrinth] It's like an antennae.  I just have to walk out of there and back in.

[I stop talking and begin thinking questions directed to the Voice.]

Oh Eric

[I switch back to speaking.]

[What happens when a person dies?]

What happens when you die is the same thing that happens when you are born.  A lot of people call it reincarnation.  It doesn't really work like that.  [something about the big bang].  People understood that when you died it wasn't a troubling thing.  It was a beautiful thing.  You die the same way you are born

The world ends when and how you want it to end.  [Your coworker] wants it to end in destruction, and everything that is happening.  When he sees the end of the world he sees it as a destructive end.  Paris in flames, Atlanta in floods, LA in fissures.  The earth broken down and shattered, burning, because this is the only power that he will allow to show him into the next world.  Your fears are different than [his].  Your main fear is that you are not moving.  Physically, psychologically, anything that represents the fear in you

I had been in Cuzco for one day when I learnt about about Ayahuasca. The next day I participated in the ceremony in the Sacred Valley under the assumption that I would be fine because I had done pot a few times.
Aside from pot I had had no prior experience with hallucinogenics or psychoactive drugs beforehand.

While my experience was intense, and as others have mentioned, changed me. I know now that I was totally unprepared for it, which made the journey a harrowing experience.

While everyone else had come out of the trance after 5-6 hours

I don't tell many people this story because it's often met with judgements and disbelief

Here is an overview of my experience: 
It began slowly. At first, into an alternate space that wasn't on Earth. I started opening and shutting my eyes, but the visions remained the same, just falling through space and time with no end in sight. At this point I moved into the foetal position and started to laugh at the absurdity of it all, at the absurdity of life. Then the laughing quickly turned into crying and I didn't know why. Just this feeling of never ending sadness that would never go away. It was at this point that I saw that vision of my father in the white room. I sobbed very hard for what felt like a long time, but may not have been - I had no temporal awareness. Then I felt a warm hand stroking my arm, which felt nice and calmed me down a bit. It was the girl next to me. Then I sat up and sang along with the songs that the Shamans were singing - Kumba ya , and others. They really helped to take us on a journey and focus our minds. I was told afterwards that I sang an entire song in Hebrew, but I don't really remember that. He went along with it, oddly enough

Also of note is this part of the journey: 
The most powerful imagery I experienced during the trip was a tableaux of a man in white sitting by a window in a white hospital room. There was an overwhelming feeling of sadness and confusion, I made a concerted effort to connect more with my father and we managed to repair our damaged relationship. Two years later and I received a call that my dad had had a stroke in Singapore. When I flew over to see him, I visited him at the hospital. As I turned into his room, I felt like I had been sucker punched in the gut.

I did this the day after my trip. I went out and bought flowers and gave them to a lady in the parking lot. To make it less creepy

The elderly lady that i gave them to was looking kind of down and she had a huge smile when i gave them to her and she even gave me a hug.

The feeling of spreading positive energy into the universe is amazing

I challenge fellow psychonauts to try this. Don't think to much

 To give context but not drown you in information, give free samples, smile, and talk to people. Thing is, since I do it all by myself, sometimes the cheese isn't always ready for people who came to the store specifically buy it, and they have to wait; sometimes 10-20 minutes. If you've ever had to work with the public, by the way. Sometimes this false illusion of superiority can turn otherwise great people into impatient

   Most interactions with customers start out pleasant, look them in the eye and say ""I'm sorry. Hey, *we're all this together.*""

  I'm not lying to you: this is like a psychonautic jedi mind-trick. The phrase is commonplace enough to just slip into conversation, bright, crowded store and we both want to get the hell out of here so we can go do different things; but in the bigger, general picture, we're **all** going through this crazy existence together as one. We're all different expressions of the universe dealing with all facets of existence together, but individually. That's what I'm *really* saying to them - I'm not talking about the cheese at all. ""We're all in this *wild ride* together"" is better than looking some unsuspecting person at the store in the eye and uttering something like ""we're all one"" because that would come off pretentious and goofy. ""We're all in this together"" is much more simple, digestible, and lucid; and it drives the point home.

  **TL/DR**: The saying ""we're all in this together"" seems commonplace but goes deeper than surface level. It can be used at work to diffuse annoyed customers if you use it right. You can also use it on yourself if you're annoyed by traffic.

I hated myself, then 6 months of out patient group sessions. I completed my 28 day program and then moved back to MO to finish out. I was speeding again within 2 days of being back. I completed my out patient program while using. 

Just after I turned 20 I was at a Festival in MO called ""Shwagstock"". I had showed up spun pretty heavily but as the day wore on I was unable to find any more. Just as the come down was about to get really horrible a friend of mine showed up with some Liquid Acid. I'm not a scientist so I couldn't tell you the strength of it but the trip itself lasted nearly 14 hours. I had done acid before so I didn't go in unaware as to what was going to happen to me

Over the next four months I put aside my weekends for Psychedelics. Mostly LSD, depressed, self hating person I used to be), the world around me seemed more beautiful no matter what state of mind I was in. Trees seemed greener, the wind felt more crisp, the smell of morning dew seemed more sharp. Then more drastic changes began, my anger vanished, I stopped hating everything

You get the idea.  I've been around the bush

I'll list just a few of mine:

- Morality is an illusion

- Love is the most powerful force in the cosmos

- Existence is a spiral

- More wisdom is held in many of the Eastern religions than anything the Western world has ever contrived.

- People are both beautiful and interesting.

- Patience

- Forgiveness

- Live for awe.

- Fear nothing

- That we are indeed the universe

- The self is constructed from itself

- God is the self.

- If we wish to truly be the happiest we can be

- You cannot outmanoeuvre your own mind.

- Music is beautiful

- People are wiser than we give them credit.

- Intellect and wisdom are very different.

- A guru exists for all people in all situations.

- There is such a thing as a wiseman or spiritual guide.

- Truth can be terrifying

- Doubt and Greed are often our most powerful motivators and spiritual destroyers.


There, what have you learned?  Also, I will answer any questions you have, so feel free to pepper me.

However

Here's the thing - your mind IS drugs. The entirety of your perceived life as you know it is a direct result of chemical interactions. Your ""normal state"" is only considered such because it's congruent to the demands of ""normal"" society. In fact

For those that take a reductionistic approach to drugs, after all.

I postulate that people hold this view for that exact reason: they are seeking to affirm the ""reality"" of their phenomenal experience, in which Baudrillard believes that places like Disneyland appeal to adults because they provide a similar contrast between apparent ""reality"" and apparent ""unreality"".

On a number of occasions throughout thousands of years, the majority has been dead fucking wrong about alot of things. so why do you want to go around seeking the approval of blind morons? maybe they trick you into thinking they are smart, funny

why should you wait for them to call you cool? Why do you need to have sex with numerous attractive people, you see how arbitrary and made up our cultural and social values really are. If that is considered and the labels they give you are just their own subjective meaningless labels, WHY NOT JUST DECLARE YOUSELF COOL RIGHT NOW? their is something that does hold meaning is how you feel, how you treat yourself. the labels you give yourself or the labels other give you are labels, but your the one who gives them power to build or destroy. the secret to this game that we have been forced to play, the game of society, we have been tricked to believe there are strict rules to this game. but you want to know what they dont want you to know? other than to love and treat each other with resepect THEIRE ARE NO FUCKING RULES

who decides what clothes are cool, its your happyness its your life, use the way you want to, all in all its the same happyness, get it in a way that makes sense to you. real freedom doesnt come from becoming financially independent or changing your religion, it comes from realizing what terrence mckenna has been saying is true that culture is not your friend, culture is a mass hallucination.

Here are some tips:

Try re-organizing your room. If you've had posters up for a few years, but just give it a try.

Try a new job, even if you stay unemployed for a few months.

Stop smoking pot for a few days. You will come out of it at first with overwhelming thoughts of anxiety and depression, your ego is a survival mechanism. So cry it out, and take a good days rest.  You'll feel great!

Be alone, you don't even know what's bothering you until you spend a few days alone, even from your family. Go camping by yourself. Realize that you're alive on this earth and your possibilities are limitless.

It's OK to not have all the things in the world that you need

Reflect on your most intimate experiences, adventures. Appreciate that you have a brain that has such great memories, let the negative ones come and go, and still remember that everything is going to be ok.

We have people working their arses off under the illusion that they will retire in comfort but to then realise it is too late. They work for a government to tax their income so it can continue its control over the people that feed it. These people consider life somewhat of a competition between fellow men

Then we have the drugs that fuel this cycle. We have caffeine to keep people productive and alcohol and cigarettes to keep people distracted from the wool pulled over their eyes. Not to mention all the other distractions present in this picture; everything from prescription anti-depressants to reality T.V. However

I, yet I feel like a some kind of hippy-douche when I (perhaps naively) claim that psychedelics may be the answer. I hope the answer lies in a humble plant somewhere on the earth but in the back of my mind im weary of the elegant simplicity of that solution. It seems too good to be true and perhaps it is. In that same spot in my mind I comes the fear that there is no answer, that what I write here is meaningless because the machine will function just fine regardless of any resistance I throw at it.

I'm 33, a parent, etc. 

What I made from the tek I used, and I look forward to trying it.  I don’t refine it or purify it, because I would end up with much less from my estimate.

What I use, I would equate it to being more an ‘earthy’ vibe. The first pulls I did were the strongest, although the later ones have been very decent as well. Trust me though, I have been ‘there’. I have broken through about 40 times in 8 months. It has zero lasting effects other than a general mindset of how amazing your own mind is. After 20-30 minutes or so, you are back to complete normal, no ‘hangover’, tiredness

This has been my favorite thing I’ve tried. I’ve done most everything in the book in my younger years that doesn’t involve a needle. I haven’t tripped or rolled in about 10 years, geltabs, mushrooms, rolling, and other club drugs, when I was in that scene. DMT works best from me because it’s short, to the point, gives no effects that will be detrimental to my psyche

What I’ve learned So Far

Setting 1:

Very key. My favorite is sitting in the middle of my bed

Setting 2:

I haven’t done it outside yet, so any type of nature (other than desert) is available. I just am very paranoid about legal issues, so I’m just waiting for a good time and place where I won’t be disturbed by other people, etc.

Eyes open vs. eyes closed:

Up until recently, many times closing my eyes. This is awesome and produces amazing visuals. A few times I left a candle burning in the distance, or used a star projector that puts thousands of dots dimly all over the room. Lately however, I got past my ‘fear’ of opening my eyes, and just did it in daylight on my bed, and this is amazing as well, just letting everything melt into fractals.

Pets:

I have a small furry dog, I’d leave them away from your area so you aren’t interrupted.

Timing:

Make sure you have nothing to do, and that my phone is on silent where I can’t see it. I don’t like being disturbed. It’s 15-20 minutes, but your family or friends stopping by and ringing your phone could be a bit jarring.

Ambient noise:

I live in a high traffic area, and cars, mopeds, etc., driving by. I hate that sound in general. I use a large air purifier that produces white noise, it mostly blocks all that out. I also use music and headphones.

Music:

Most people I’ve read about don’t like to listen to anything. I LOVE music and have specific preferences I’ve decided work best for me. My favorite thing to listen to is by a DJ / producer named Sasha, this is what I have listened to the most. The tracks flow and change perfectly, and it’s just my favorite. A few other things I like are very minimal ambient techno, such as Porter Ricks, or Plastikman / Richie Hawtin. Other things I have tried either are too slow, too fast, or too disorienting. I don’t like vocals, as if I hear voices, Entheogenic

Headphones / Music:

I use an iPod Touch, but I have studio quality DJ headphones from Sony that have a much wider frequency response, including more bass. Some people might not like having larger headphones on, but I’ve used them all my life, so I don’t mind. These headphones block out EVERYTHING else, so be prepared not to hear ANYTHING if there is an emergency. I prefer to be in this world I facilitate, vs. just random outside sounds that might annoy or disorient me. A few times, and I had to take them off

Smoking utensil:

I have tried 10 or so different methods, hit it with my lighter from below, and see the amount of smoke. This has worked the best for me, other methods haven’t worked so well and it’s annoying if you don’t get off as hard as you want, or are fumbling around with your utensil.

Lighters:

A butane windproof lighter works the best, one will always fail, which can be confusing when you are between your first and second or third hit.

Smoking:

I have tried it with weed, as if the DMT and weed are taking turns fading in and out. While that is certainly cool, I have found it’s not what I want. I want the straight hit, right into me, ASAP. Make sure you hold it in as long as possible and breathe out from your nose. Try to get three hits in, in under a minute. If you’ve never tried it, it tastes plastic-ish

Smoking 2:

If you don’t get off (re: hyperspace), and it’s just not as good, and you are wasting it. If you have a limited supply, DEFINITELY wait at least 12 hours or so to try to get off again. It can be super frustrating I know, but respect that it didn’t work, it’s not the time to waste your supply. It’s just not worth the end result.

Artist: Daft Punk

Album: Random Access Memories

Song: Beyond



    Dream
    Beyond dreams
    Beyond life
    You will find
    Your
    
    Song
    Before sound
    To be found
    Close your eyes
    And
    
    Rise
    Higher still
    Endless thrill
    To the land
    Of
    
    Love
    Beyond love
    Come alive
    Angel Eye
    Forever watching you and I
    
    You are the night
    You are the ocean
    You are the light behind a cloud
    You are the end and the beginning
    A world where time is not allowed
    
    There's no such thing as competition
    To find a way we lose control
    Remember
    This is a journey of the soul
    
    The perfect song is framed with silence
    It speaks of places never seen
    Your home's a promise long forgotten
    It is the birthplace of your dreams

Having seen so many posts recently about how upset we are about what society has become

We are faced with so much propaganda about how we're supposed to act, think, and do. Work hard, make money, save for your old age, retire, and die. This propaganda comes at us from every angle, government

What can be done? I was thinking and thinking, what do we do? We spread our own propaganda. 

It will not be difficult, nothing but the peaceful spreading of information. A post from earlier today gave me the idea: pamphlets. Pamphlets, note cards, posters, anything and everything to spread this idea of unity and expansion of self.

So now, to help me. I know you've been struggling with what you can do to help just as I have. We can all be the change we would like to see in the world, but sometimes change needs a little help. We pass them out, leave a stack in the waiting rooms wherever we are, leave them on the seats of the bus, anything to make them visible.
Let's make this big! All over the country

&gt;Artsy redditors, or put in a pamphlet or notecard. Send me a digital version! 

&gt;We also need pamphlet designs! Make them simple, let's say on the front page and bottom right of each page. We don't need to berate the reader, simply make them adopt a different view. 

Come on
This is The Initiative for Human Consciousness. Let's change the world.

**EDIT: I think propaganda was too harsh of a word, used to promote or publicize a particular political cause or point of view.""
We will not be spreading misinformation. We will not be spreading lies

**EDIT2: The idea of all of this is not to have demonstrations, so people can come to the conclusion for themselves. People are more likely to change if they feel like it is something they themselves want. These handouts, left in conspicuous places around cities, will cause some (perhaps not many, but still some) to change. The idea is then for those people to influence others, and propagate the idea that way.**",,self,,

i realized that as humans we all pulse at different frequencies. sometime you meet people who seem completely opposite of you then you gradually realise you were more alike than you knew. that's like the lights alternating then syncing up again.

not all pulses sync up long enough to notice and some pulses remain at the same frequency while others vary from time to time.

this metaphor can be applied to life and everyone you meet. remember that not everyone operates on the same wave. you'll find an enemy in a best friend just as easy as you can find a best friend in an enemy. its all about timing.

________________________

To my friends and family.

I love you all dearly. I have decided to leave and go on a journey on foot. I will just be going with the flow, then find a new passion. You don't need anything for happiness, you already have it. Friends and family are greater than cars and houses. I know some of you will miss me, but when I find the chances to use the internet I will indeed say ""Hi"" and check in. My top priority will be to find a consistent flow of walking and resting, I have camping gear, and military training, so I am not afraid of sleeping in the woods. I actually fear nothing at this point in my life, and I will do the same for you.

With love

Jason.

These types of adults, their children and the interactions that accompanied unfortunately helped mold me into pathetically narrow minded individual who adhered to a single religion and idea of running the world. 

I began a non stop cannabis habit 3 years ago when I first came to college, Psilocybin, MDMA, Salvia, which in each capsule of interaction would offer a more liberalized and (I'll make this a verb) 'spiritualized' mindset as I returned to reality. I began to become aware of the universe, the connection of spirit that transcends the 3 binding dimensions we exist in, the concept that humanity... Most likely like yourself. Yes you

My friends have come to regard me as the fairly well versed, in a sense have become comfortably detached from reality. 
When I first started college I had made a connection with an individual who moved to challenge my way of thinking and would always play devils advocate for any positions I established. He was fairly well versed in the realm of the metaphysical by the time we had initially met so my pretty conversvative being found him slightly repulsive yet I would entertain his ideas as he would mine. Two years later I met up with him again to purchase some LSD, charge our DMT on crystals and meditate about it together. He sears into my mind that this is not something to be toyed with. It is a spiritual tool. It is a method of discovery. There is a metaphysical world and if I don't believe it I soon will. 

I trip.

Phenomenal.

Life changing.

""Words can't describe...""

Black... 

I whisper ""Why was I afraid...""

And after thousands of years of knowledge had been bestowed upon me I drop the gem

""I have to have children now""

I stand up. I stretch. I breath for the first time and look at the individuals who had done the ritual with me and giggle and say ""Holyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy FUCK."" and the silence is broken as everyone laughs with me. ""How long?"" He responds ""5 minutes."" I instantly call my best friend 50 times. I call my other closest friend 50 times and tell them about everything I experienced ""SHAPES, but now it rang more true than ever. 

I eventually ferry my two closest friends to his place of residence and he offers them the experience. The both have very similar trips where their spirual ickyness melts away and they overcome huge obstacles in their cosmic existence. In our college careers we are all at a point where we are depressed

This made me draw a parallel to psychedelics.  We go through our whole lives from birth, getting very attached to it. Once in a while, a bubble comes up and we ignore it. Some people, decide they want to know more, so they meditate. This causes lots of bubbles to come up, and eventually a better understanding of what reality is. 

Psychedelia don't cause bubbles, you realize deeply about the reality you are really submerged in, and it's way crazier than the still calm waters that we experience every day.

Anybody who meditates regularly eventually experiences what happens during a drug trip, all of the trippy things that happen, the oneness, the visuals,  everything... is considered another thing to doubt, another thing to push beyond.  You force yourself on beyond these illusions.  The drug experience, no matter how powerful it feels, producing dangerous illusions of wisdom and self-greatness.  

Enlightenment is not the perma-trip.  It is a kind of ease and a kind of wisdom that comes from familiarity with all aspects of the transcendental experience combined with the absolute integration of the ego into the beyond and into the ordinary.  

I'm writing this because I'm feeling concerned about some of the illusory thinking going on here; it's just my $.02 and it's to help.

(Also

&gt; Fucking on LSD

I was unsure whether I really wanted to have sex or not, you?"". ""Well, let's try"". I'm glad we did. At the start it was a little weird, but sex with this guy always feels weird, his body is not familiar. He is always trying to please me, and I wonder if I am able to please him. We start to kiss, it is going ok so far, but I get into it. We take our clothes off, I don't just feel my body, he is tanned and has long unkempt hair. He is beautiful. He is my proto-man

There's a break while we lie there, that there is more. He finds a condom. I am unsure if I will be able to keep going to actual sex. But it is ok, he is an amazing lover, he knows how to touch that special spot. It feels good just to fuck, to have that feeling inside, to know that he is creating it, and experience my thoughts and feelings at the same time. I dig my hands into his chest hair and I am a fox running through the forest at night. Moonlight on red fur. Slipping through the trees, hair in the wind
I am closing to coming and I am a waterfall, prasad, an opened coconut. An constant stream of water flowing over the brim of the coconut. All these things are the thoughts from my body. All the while pink floyd is playing, psychedelic music. 

Eventually I am exhausted from fucking, tight and close. Faster until he peaks. I smile and hug him, pleased. We lay side by side, enjoying the afterglow.

----------

I really had underestimated the emotional power of MDMA. Before, like I knew the happiness had no reason, it was just a chemical reaction. This time I did it with some old and new friends and it was a beautiful experience. It is definitely possible to work through emotional pain with this stuff. I've been thinking a lot about my self-enforced celibacy. I haven't slept with anyone since the guy in the story and I went our separate ways about six months ago. I rationalised my celibacy at the beginning by saying I needed time and space to integrate all the things I experienced while travelling and with psychedelics. I feel, even still, like I would be content if I never slept with another guy again. Whole new parts of life have opened up to me, and I feel like there is so much to learn. I guess, to be blunt

This is true, spent countless nights smoking joints listening to music, went to festivals and parties all over, saw sunrises and sunsets on mountains, beaches and deserts. We had some very powerful experiences together, with and without drugs. Since I met him, I had to literally rewrite my entire conception of reality. That will have a profound effect on a person. After this weekend I left wondering if I will always feel this, I am glad of the choices I have made.

&gt;Read. Reading can be incredibly beneficial for your focus and concentration. I almost look at it like a form of meditation now; transforming my TV time into reading time has done wonders for my ability to get work done

&gt;Everyday

**sleadbetterz**
&gt;Every day I try and lessen my bad habits like judging people too quickly / getting angry or frustrated about things / general laziness. It's hard work but rewarding more than anything else!

**Synthetic**
&gt;Drum and dance like no-one is watching. I've had ""bad days"" transformed into ""best-day-ever""s after dancing out the bullshit.
Focus on your breath
Edit: I've also found that smoking a pipe has been helping me to raise my general vibrations. Really helps to keep a clear mind and keep my focus in the moment. Just puttin that out there.
REedit: Hugs. Hug someone at least once a day. 8 hugs a day minimum is ideal

**4dseeall**
&gt;Be honest. Play fair. Do good. Act whatever you want to be.

**FrequenStephen**
&gt;Music

**Techno_Shaman**
&gt;Here's a small one that may or may not fit. I put tape or otherwise remove most of the lights in my room. For example: the light on the front of a PC. The darkness helps me sleep soundly and the absense of light is good for a natural rythem.

**FutureDaze**
&gt;Meditation. Going outside. Qigong or yoga. Pranayama. Expression - either writing, etc. Forming good community. Bodily contact - anything from sex to massages and hugging. Working towards autonomy. Doing public service/volunteering. Spreading positive energy and watching the ripples. Good diet (I, myself prefer a Daoist diet which is mostly local, seasonal vegetarian but sometimes eat fish). Hobbies (lately I've been getting into studying mythology and learning about foraging).

**gunthert**
&gt;Pick up any trash you see on the ground. We ourselves are the earth

**SubjectivPerspectiv**
&gt;MUSIC! play music and getting involved with it

**CapnScumbone**
&gt;Be kind. How was this overlooked? Compassion is everything.

**_defunk**
&gt;obviously always try to be learning new things
also teach! teaching is such a great way to reinforce and learn more yourself as well as the fact that it spreads knowledge!

**mauielauie**
&gt;Enjoy the beauty of greenery/ plants as you walk about every day.

**Chispy**
&gt;Browse /r/futurology. It gets you thinking about the future of humanity. Improves your outlook on life and gets you excited about your future. Socialize and discuss with other people about our possible futures... The possibilities really are endless.

**the_mushroom_speaks**
&gt;Singing in the Shower... singing at all

**chiops**
&gt;Love. Love love. Love love love. Love love love love love. Love
It gets you high, It's the All and the Everything and let It flow, like a current. Open It, like a box. Release It, like the hiss of a noble gas essential. Love them all, for what they are. Love yourself, for all You are. Love the Me, Love the Us
It's funny you mention dreaming with marijuana, but.
Practice feeling vibrations. Practice invoking vibrations. You are the captain of a vehicle of consciousness, and Know, and shift phases to absorb things Unreal.
And never forget

**DalvaMozzerX**
&gt;In = Out
the quality of the love you give will be the love you can recieve, the better grades you will get, etc.

&gt;Do something which excites you, or making minor positive based conversation with strangers.


**afourthfool**
&gt;Sabbaticals are glorious and genius however they are rationed. That said:
1 life absorbed per day, some reading on a public bench, and some kind of quirky realization someone was trying to use as a conversation lighter next to me at the bus stop.

2 pages (~1000) written a weekend

I stand all the time. Sitting feels so sacred to me. I look forward to sitting at meals. When i hike

**D4rv1d**
&gt;Make your everyday chores a time where you let go of thoughts and focus on the task. Make dinner

**hs0o**
&gt;*Fast from food for at least 1-5 days every month (it can be tough

&gt;Not if you're BMI is perfect and you have a fast metabolism :/
But anyway

**workerbeee**
&gt;Juicing! It feels wonderful. Barley grass, beets, kale, spinach, ginger, broccoli. Tons of nutrients I would normally never consume.

**skinjamin**
&gt;Make a list or think about all the positives in your life. Sometimes it's easy to get bogged down with the bad

**Empty**
&gt;Staying present. It doesn't matter what you do. It could be music, talking to friends, etc., anything that brings you into the present moment. Meditation is a great way to cultivate this skill so you can be present all the time, especially during the dull times.


**buckminsterchiller**
&gt;Find an artistic medium and then do it places where its socially unacceptable.

**buckminsterchiller**
&gt;Visualize scenarios and then follow through with them, while smoking a bowl with a certain lighter, in a specific room with the lights dimmed a certain way with a particular incense...etc, and then try to add stuff into your visualizations to see if they manifest later.


**sgguitar88**
&gt;I really can't understand people who think it's a good idea not to pay attention to what's going on around the world. If you really want to raise your vibrations


**MavrichChachkie**
&gt;Loving this thread guys. It reminds me of a list I call ""how to get out of a funk"" -Going over old journal entries. You can see how far you've come along. You might be able to see how much the questions you ask have evolved. -Taking a shower -Play music -Drink your favorite tea -Take your vitamins -Meditation or prayer


**ShaolinShade**
&gt;Do something cool for someone else. Seeing someone else happy because of you is one of the most satisfying things in the world
Side note: I love you guys. Reading through these comments just made me feel enlightened and happy

**permanomad**
&gt;Getting lost in conversation and laughing. Practising and teaching yoga. Growing gourmet and medicinal mushrooms.

**zgrocks9**
&gt;One thing I really enjoy doing is cleaning. When, out of the loop, or just generally weird, I will clean up my apartment. It feels great to be focusing on one task rather than the thoughts going through your mind, and afterwards, everything seems to work its way out. I forget about whatever was stressing me for no reason, and I come up with ways to solve whatever problems I may have at the time.

**mongo_lloyd**

We live in an age when the concept of being a 'leader' is skewed by the culture and media into being a caricature of the alpha male; the dominant player, commanding the majority of the resources. Do we really need more of those people?

I understand where several of you are coming from with this but I think the language is far more divisive than we even realise. I think a world where people are empowered and willing to cooperate under certain types of supervision is fantastic, making us easier to control for those higher up the chain.

Sometimes we don't even realize the language is having that effect on us. We shouldn't send the wrong message that can easily be confused.

------------------------------------

Hello my friends. I've seen a lot of posts lately about how many of you are finding it perplexity difficult to mesh all of the realizations, I've been right there with you, but I have good news for you. I finally have come to a place where I feel confident in saying that I have a solution. 

We know we operate from ideologies staunchly opposite from the mainstream. We are finding it frivolous to interact with our fellow 'humans' who are caught up in the charade game and illusions of the society we are equally reserved from playing any part in. We feel trapped like cattle in a system designed to turn us into consumers; destined to slave at some job to earn a pittance barely sufficient to supply our vices which wash away the dissonance of being part of such a system. We long for something greater, but we cannot see it! We do not know where the path to it is. Surely we would leap and shout with joy if there was but a way, if there was some ship in the harbor we could sail away on to a new place where all live in accordance with the tugging and demanding call of a higher way of taking part in our shared existence. You know what I am talking about, because I know this is what you have been talking about.

First of let me begin by reminding you that you are not trapped. You are not weak. You are not helpless. You are not alone. WE are not alone. We are not clutched by a fate we cannot control. We are not subdued by the society which  attempts to unless we allow it. Do not allow it. All moments of the evernow are opportunities for you to take charge and guide yourself and your life towards the calling change we are all starving for.

Society is a dieing behemoth. It's treatise and values and desires have been lifted to the place of a godhead, African villagers lusting for AirJordans, foreign peoples no less than slaves to feed the gluttonous mouth of the greedy world. It sickens us to our core, but we cannot escape it or hide from it.

We cannot change this behemoth, malfunction, and nonfunction are its way of operation. The channels of change have stopped themselves up for without rigid adherence to 'tradition' and the code of how it has been done, the system would collapse and the dying body would shatter to pieces. Behind their delusions they cling to so desperately their system slowly collapses upon their heads. We see this with open eyes, but they still feel its truth tugging at their cores. They are afraid.

We do not need to be afraid. 

We do not need to struggle in fear to revive and reform the vile beast

We need to create our own microsocieties where we already. A new life within the dying old. Small and intimate

We are a dispersed community. We should change that. Not in some mass exodus to some cultish compound or revolting new state, but others are not so lucky. We do not have brothers in arms or an understanding family of fellow psychonauts to support each other. This is what we desperately need.

All life began from a single cell, but I am not talking about doing drugs together. I am talking about LIVING together. Instead of simply having cooperative collaboration abstractly with our ideas, we need to collaborate our LIVES. We are being of immense strength, intelligence, creativity, and love, but that is on our OWN. Imagine what we can achieve united. Even with simply one, would your efforts to help the other not expound the good you could manifest in this world?

We are used to our solitary introspection in our lonely corners under the influence of a personal dose of some drug to reveal our personal stumbling blocks, cut off from our fellow seekers and brothers and sisters in love. Why?! Why do we listen when the world tells us we are alone? LOOK AT THIS SUBREDDIT. We are not alone. We are merely separated.

Stop trying to force yourself back into the old

Find psychonauts near you, and cooperate in each other lives. Any form of this is something I think is absolutely vital for us. We lack it and we feel that lack intensely. Reach out and seek each other. Unite and grow together. Work with each other to be the change we desire from ourselves and those around us.

Personally I want to live with you guys. I want to be in a shared house of psychonauts. [I made this post seven months ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/kuux4/i_have_this_burning_idea_in_me_i_cant_seem_to/) and I unfortunately was caught up in personal turmoil and change since then and have not made any progress towards this, but lifemates. Taking part in each others lives, creating together, learning together, reaching out and changing the world together. I want to paint with you, sing with you, talk with you, clean house with you

By ourselves we are strong. We are beacons of universal love. We are lights in the dark. We are thinking universe. We are vaults of truth and understanding. We are portals of creation. We are fountains of the infinite into the limited. But this is what we are separated.

Together we resonate. Together we exponentialize. Two creeks become a stream. Two streams become a river. The river cuts threw mountains and united we become the sea. If we join together

This is the calling I hear and feel. This is what I want my life to become. I live in Portland, start your own. Reach out, connect, and unite.

1331753504.0,qwlln,Last night was my first experience with psychedelics ever.  I did a gram of Iboga.  Nothing could have prepared me for it.,NolanVoid,151,6,89,"For many of you, so I mixed it all up with yogurt and gulped it down.

The change crept up slowly, but I knew the forces were in motion, and there was nothing I could do to turn back.  Poor Crowley.  Then I began to notice that every thing I said or heard was echoing at least three times.  About an hour in, my sitter came in.  He had no idea what to expect from this.  It was the first time either of us had experienced anything like it.  After I came down I asked him what it was like to watch me.  He said when first came in it was like walking in on an exorcism.

There were three expressions of entities that I dealt with primarily.  The first was what I will call the Phantasm.  The Phantasm was glimmering blob of amorphous energy, and then suddenly remember I had to come back and I had to breath.  Eventually I realized the Phantasm was just trying to distract me, and I said something to the effect of ""I want to see the real stuff.""

That's when the Mother and the Father came in.  They were both black.  The father was dressed in what one might think of as traditional tribesman garb, of all the stupid shit that I've done and continue to do.  Everything he said was done to break down my stupidity for me so I could understand it like the dummy I was.  And yet, I could not argue with it.  I had to accept it, because I knew coming from him it was true.  He said I had come knocking to hear what he had to say and he was going to tell me.

While the Father was tearing down everything that was wrong with me, energy that could not be denied or refused.  It was overwhelming.  It was good at the same.  It was terrifying.  But they were the most loving things about this experience.  The thing that sticks with me the most from this trip, is when the Father says to me, ""Are you still afraid to die?  Because this is what it's going to be like.""  His tone was as if he was saying ""wake the fuck up, you dummy.""  Like he couldn't believe somebody could be as stupid as I was and not realize it.  It was not demeaning at all.  It was very comical.

What we think of as our everyday world was inverted.  The ""real"" world was like a dream, because staring at one thing for too long pulled me back in to the Other.  At one point I had to ask my sitter to put his hand on me so that I could know that I was still here.

I asked the Mother and the Father some questions about what to do about a few personal situations in my life: an old love I've been waiting for, all my improper unhealthy little ways of living.  And the Mother chimed in ""And tell your mother that you love her more often.""  It was her little moment of playing bad cop, showing that there is yin in the yang and the yang in the yin.

And after that harrowing experience came the throwing up for 6 hours, we remember something stupid we did when we were young.  Maybe we said something careless, or hurt someone's feelings.  And we still get embarrassed about it even though it was years ago.  Everything about my life before Iboga felt like that after I was done.  Now I'm scared I won't be able to make the changes that I know I need to, to fulfill the demands that they made of me.  But I'm going to devote myself to them.  And if I fail, at least I will have tried.",,False,t5_2qplv,True

So

When you do this, the *actual reality* is often that you have accumulated thoughts, and you are now being possessed by these thoughts.  I can say this with confidence because I discovered this (after much denial and discomfort) to be my own experience, and I'm positive I'm not the only one.

Basically, then you simply can't rely on the memories of your experiences to guide you through life accurately.  The unchecked mind (ego) is extremely powerful and susceptible to outside influences, and it *will* be pulled astray unless you have a way of keeping yourself grounded.  Meditation is the only way I'm aware of to do this other than psychedelics.

A major implication of this is that this subreddit should be taken with a grain of salt.  I am positive that there are many wonderfully intelligent and open-hearted people here with plenty of genuine wisdom to share

Luckily, shifted gears, and hit the gas enough to avoid being rear-ended.  I did this all subconsciously. It just happened. I didn't think about it. ""I"" was an observer, watching my body do all this, seemingly by itself. It was a surreal experience and as I started to continue driving down the road I had this strange sensation. My mind ""caught up"" to my body. And when I say this, it almost felt as if my mind was on one end of a rubber band and my body was on the other end. 

The rubber band had been stretched during the experience. ""Time"" had slowed down, but my subconscious was hard at work, seemingly operating my body perfectly to do a very complex multitask, in real-time. During those 4 seconds my perception was that of maybe thirty minutes of detail. I have such a vivid memory of what happened, but it was over so quickly. The time dilation was very much like time dilation while tripping. As I regained my composure the rubber band snapped back together and my vision turned to colors of lines, almost like the ""lightspeed"" effect in starwars, but instead of spaced out white lights it was at a much higher resolution and things retained their color. It only lasted for a fraction of a second but the mental sensation was unreal. I was back in real time, much like I do while tripping and meditating.

1374968238.0,1j6rsw,I was just punished for hubris and perversion. Long post with trip report. [NSFW - graphic],NotEntirelyLucid,162,30,128,"I'm going to start by saying two things: 

The first is that I understand DMT now. There is no magical spirit world that DMT transports you to. The beings that you see while you're high aren't real

The second is that I'm never smoking DMT again. 


----

I got my first DMT the other day (threads [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/1iy4tc/after_years_ive_found_it/) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/1j3g1v/after_years_ive_found_it_update_with_detailed/)) and have smoked it three days in a row and broke through each time. The first was experimentation

The first two taught me nothing

I wrote in my last trip report about being soul-fucked by an angry, whirring sound of moving machinery. It felt spiritually wrong and amazing physically, like how cheating on someone you love must feel. 

She was the personification of my hedonistic perversion - warm and satisfying

I had to feel her again. 

Instead of being with close friends out in nature like the other times

As I pulled the bong I knew I was doing a bad thing but I pushed it to the back of my mind and comforted myself with thoughts of good things to ensure my trip was smooth - it was already too late to stop. I sat it down

For a moment I tried to fap through it, afraid of who I'd see, but I couldn't help it.

The void was not the vivid and cheerful colours I'd seen before, just observing.

This was the personification of my introspective examination.

The black walls and face morphed into a red grid with furious faces emerging and receding from it

They were the personification of the part of me that knows I know better than this.

I don't know why but I started fapping again. Maybe I thought I could still bring back the wasp-faced temptress. Then I saw the most human face I've seen in the void yet. I could only see his bald blue head and shoulders; his face was serene and sad. He reached out an arm and placed it on my shoulder as if to comfort me - like I was sick. No words were spoken

He was the personification of my purification.

I was still tripping hard when I stood up and flung open my curtains. I needed to see nature and sunlight. I dropped onto my bed and closed my eyes

The black face peeked around corners of the grid as it faded. 

-----

The acrid stink of DMT was making me sick. I rose to my feet

My dog looked up at me with his tail between his legs and fled the room. I hope he didn't get high. Maybe he could just sense that I was *wrong*.

I went outside and sat in the sun on my veranda, being there.

Usually the cat is detached and aloof.

I no longer see sex as a pleasurable act that is separate from love. The two are parts of one whole. I don't want to masturbate anymore. You can't love yourself in that way. I have a beautiful fiancee to make love to

Do any of you suffer from depression or anything the like that ruins your love perception towards this world?

Go through these posts and read. There are so many beautiful people here sharing their love and attention towards our family.

Love is not about loving those with a behavior that is right for you. True love is unconditional. In all honesty, our life experiences, the similarities we experience, despite our ego's that may be different, we are all filled with love, curiosity, despair, it's a beautiful thing. 

We're all looking for the same thing in different ways.

I don't want you guys to suffer from others who mindlessly release their pain upon you. If any of you are in a relationship, mistakes, pain, insecurities, and you feel worthless, please stray from them. Do not let anyone abuse you, in any way shape or form. Your mind cannot be in that gutter that crumbles you. Don't look for love in the wrong places.

When you find the right person

You are not perfect people. But that does not mean you are not amazing.

To someone out there, you are amazing. Every fiber of your being will be something special to them. 

We're all equal here. Some of us have fucked up stories that have made us miserable. All of us have done something stupid in one way or another and we've fucked up. But we're not fuck ups if you choose not to have that mindset. There's a potential inside you that you have no idea what it is. You are not your demons.

I have finally realized why we are different from most people. It's no surprise that we're ""deeper thinkers"" than most people

The thing that separates me from most people isn't, critically, and openly at myself. I'm at peace with myself and comfortable in my own skin because i've spent years analyzing myself...determining my strengths and weaknesses...and learning to accept and love myself despite these weaknesses. It's been a long journey, and the journey will never end, but i'm so completely content with myself at this point in my life, and that is one of the single most important things you can obtain in life.

I realized that the reason I was on such a crusade to share psychedelics with the world was because I simply desired people to get ""on my level"". To be open and honest with themselves about who they are. I feel passionately that if you are in tune with yourself, essentially...and I don't mean that in some sort of esoteric, hippie way...but we are all humans with the same basic wiring. If you are able to seriously analyze yourself, you can understand others. My SO can know exactly what is going through my head just through looking at my expressions. We're in tune with each other.

May 1, pure *dhyana*. It was so much simpler than I ever guessed, and it is obviously a matter of practice. No wonder the yogis say that it's dangerous to do this without a guru: I am no better or worse, morally, and no wiser or more ""spiritual."" Repetition is the whole key. Force the nerves and muscles and glands, force them day after day, and it happens. The chief function of the guru is to ensure that you don't take advantage of the new freedom too quickly and get yourself in trouble with the authorities. The guru doesn't help it happen at all (as the honest ones admit); you do all the work yourself. The guru just makes sure that the rapture flows into ""safe"" (domesticated?) channels. Without such a moral watchdog

I just realized why all the real occult schools are so damned secretive

&gt;**Terran* *Archives* *2803:* *Dhyana* was the Sanskrit name, and the techniques of inducing it, became *Ch'an* in China and *Zen* in Japan. It was always supervised by an *alpha* *male* for the reasons Crane suspected. It represents the dawning of post-primate consciousness and the HEAD Revolution, thereby rendering the biot independent of the primate dominance-submission hierarchy.

May 27, ever again.

I can see more and more clearly why all this is ""sealed with seven seals"" and hidden behind all kinds of mystification. *Society as we know it is based on torture and death, as to any primate; it is the form of torture our society countenances. It is no torture to me only because I have learned certain neurological arts every stage magician learns. 

But if everybody could go into *dhyana* at will, by fear of death, even. All existing society is based on keeping those fears alive, to control the masses.

Ten people who know what I know would be more dangerous than a million armed anarchists.

It was a car accident. Nothing particularly remarkable, trust me.

And that’s when you met me.

“What… what happened?” You asked. “Where am I?”

“You died

“There was a… a truck and it was skidding…”

“Yup

“I… I died?”

“Yup. But don’t feel bad about it. Everyone dies

You looked around. There was nothingness. Just you and me. “What is this place?” You asked. “Is this the afterlife?”

“More or less

“Are you god?” You asked.

“Yup

“What about them?”

“Will they be all right?”

“Don’t worry, your marriage was falling apart. If it’s any consolation, she’ll feel very guilty for feeling relieved.”

You followed along as we strode through the void. “Where are we going?”

“Nowhere in particular

“So what’s the point, right? A baby. So all my experiences and everything I did in this life won’t matter.”

“Not so!” I said. “You have within you all the knowledge and experiences of all your past lives. You just don’t remember them right now.”

I stopped walking and took you by the shoulders. “Your soul is more magnificent, and when you bring it back out, you’ve gained all the experiences it had.

“You’ve been in a human for the last 48 years

“How many times have I been reincarnated

“Wait

“Well, only exists in your universe. Things are different where I come from.”

“Where you come from?” You said.

“Oh sure

“Oh, I could have interacted with myself at some point.”

“Sure. Happens all the time. And with both lives only aware of their own lifespan you don’t even know it’s happening.”

“So what’s the point of it all?”

“Seriously?” I asked. “Seriously? You’re asking me for the meaning of life? Isn’t that a little stereotypical?”

“Well it’s a reasonable question

“You mean mankind? You want us to mature?”

“No

“Just me? What about everyone else?”

“There is no one else

You stared blankly at me. “But all the people on earth…”

“All you. Different incarnations of you.”

“Wait. I’m everyone!?”

“Now you’re getting it

“I’m every human being who ever lived?”

“Or who will ever live

“I’m Abraham Lincoln?”

“And you’re John Wilkes Booth

“I’m Hitler?” You said

“And you’re the millions he killed.”

“I’m Jesus?”

“And you’re everyone who followed him.”

You fell silent.

“Every time you victimized someone, you’ve done to yourself. Every happy and sad moment ever experienced by any human was, or will be, experienced by you.”

You thought for a long time.

“Why?” You asked me. “Why do all this?”

“Because someday

The patterns of avoidance also avoid some emotional connection. They limit the extent of emotional connection between males

1331913698.0,qzih8,LSD Saved my Life?,,143,19,54,"I attended Binghamton University for about two months- while I was there I was undergoing a period of very severe depression in which I was strongly considering the idea of ending my life- I felt as though the positive experiences in life were not worth the pain I felt on a regular basis. I was also battling an eating disorder- I would eat very small amounts very rarely because I had dealt with some level of obesity in the past and had relatively severe body image and self-esteem issues. I was highly egocentric and all of this at once compiled into the greatest mope session in the world- I was unable to handle my college classes I was so sad all the time. Ew.
I decided to try LSD- I had heard incredible things about it- and I had been experimenting with other mind-altering substances as well, and synthetic marijuana or ""spice"" products) so I did heavy research and discovered it was a pretty benign molecule. 
Two tabs of Lysergic Acid Diethylamide were placed on my tongue at about 4:20pm, no more preconceived notions or prejudice, no more opinions, no more judging- I was buddha in Freshman form. I had achieved a sort of cosmic bliss- my ego unraveled and my sense of self renewed.  I ingested only a few hundred micrograms of a chemical and after about an hour or so I had started to think harder, faster, and in some ways better about my place in the universe than I ever had before. I began to explode with sudden realizations as to how little I was- how insignificant I was. However I knew how significant all the pains of life felt. I began to dive down the rabbit hole and began to see that the only significance anything has is the significance the mind applies to it- and I began to remember who it was I always really wanted to be. 
I remembered how much I loved people- even after years of identifying as being a misanthropic loner. I began to see how mysterious and incredible of a thing it was to be alive. I was amazed in the true sense of the word. I was more than that. I thought in ways and on levels I had never thought I could achieve- and as I tripped I felt myself healing. I became reminded of the glory of existing. Why was there something instead of nothing? This question alone was enough to inspire. That's what it truely was- inspiring. Inspiring on a psycho-emotional level that I had never imagined before. I spent the whole night walking around and musing on my thoughts. I wandered about campus starry-eyed and full of wonder at the infinite beauty of the universe from sundown till daybreak
I found myself covered in ink and paint
My slightly-dilated afterglowing eyes roved over the scratched mirror in my dorm bathroom last October and saw me at about 155 pounds and 6’2 (I wasn’t that skinny- how could I have had an eating disorder, proudly and with confident conviction.
I looked at myself in the mirror and after months and months of fighting and struggling I finally said “fuck it

Life became more than worth it again. It became a wonder. And in many ways it has remained so ever since then. I dropped out of college and am currently pursuing my dream in a career in music and the performing arts. I am working hard and I am in love with the glory that is life.
I can credit LSD with helping me do some incredible things for myself on the inside. Repairing what was broken

1329273292.0,pq3or,"My Iboga flood. (Sorry for the length, it was a very long, worthwhile journey.)",,136,68, because he was waiting to get as much methadone out of his system as possible. He is currently entering his flood as I type this.

I took 1.9 grams of TA in gel caps. I extracted it myself and cleaned it all up with acetone

I laid in the dark bedroom waiting for the experience to come on. I have to get some backstory established so that the experience fits together. Basically, though. I have never had a girlfriend that I didn’t cheat on (we’re at like 10 or so on the tally). This includes the current one. We go to separate schools, about 4 or 5 hours apart. It wasn’t an issue at first, but it would wear on me when I wouldn’t see her for long periods of time. I would start flirting with other girls occasionally, etc. Don’t get me wrong, I love this girl. She is my perfect match. But like I said, I had a very bad habit

So I’d been cheating on my girlfriend. Somehow I managed to convince myself that I should break up with her and start dating the girl I had been having sex with. I looked at her as too different from me (if only in subtle ways).

I was laying in the bed, when the trip began. The first thing I saw was a tiny black man hovering in front of my phone, shouting “No! NO! STOP IT! PUT IT DOWN!”

So I put it down. I rolled over and closed my eyes, I could feel something above me trying to pull me up. I slowly realized it was the same black man who had yelled at me. So I looked up (this happened in my head) and he reached his hand down toward me, offering to pull me up. I gladly grabbed onto his hand and AWAY WE WENT. We sailed over this huge, beautifully arching rainbow, then across a quick succession of other rainbows. We kept going up and up and up, very fast. 

Then he started talking to me. He began telling me about the nature of some very strange Ayahuasca experiences I have had over the last 6 months. He explained that the loop I kept falling into on Ayahuasca was actually a direct representation of the approaching singularity, forever. He said that it always had been and always will be; the cycle will never stop. He said we weren’t living along a linear timeline, but a timeloop. This didn’t make any sense to me, so I asked him what it meant. He then showed me a vertical line (timeline) next to a circle (timeloop). The line grew into an arrow on one end, which then started rotating around the circle. I understood that this meant time was a cycle, and while time seems to be moving linearly, if you were to make it all the way to the end it would just start over again at the beginning.

Suddenly another black man appeared, my guide, but he was appearing to me in a different form.

He grabbed my hand again and pulled me even further up. Suddenly I was looking at myself. This was startling, and I realized that it wasn’t really me I was seeing, but again Mr. Iboga. It was then that I realized even in his earlier forms, his voice had sounded exactly like mine. I had that something similar to Bicameralism was going on, and this was just the voice of God in my head talking to my ego, teaching it.

Things begin to get really hazy from here

At one point I asked him what I should do about the situation with my girlfriend. Whether I should choose her or the other girl. He brought up pictures of both of them framed in rectangles, I had decided already to break up with my girlfriend. I thought to myself, “well maybe I just won’t LISTEN to Mr. Iboga! Maybe I’ll do whatever I feel like!!” What a silly thing for me to think.

The climax of the visionary state came as he grabbed my hand and pulled me up higher and higher and higher. We stopped in front of this small wooden door that looked extremely familiar. I knew where he had taken me; to the threshold. He opened the door. I asked if I was supposed to go through it. He said “I don’t know. You could.”

I knew that if I went through the door it would mean I’d leave my physical body forever. He seemed like he really wanted me to go through it, I am about to have a heart attack.”

Suddenly, very intense. I closed my eyes again. There was Mr. Iboga, for the last time. He said “I have shown you the secrets of the cosmos, taken you through death’s door and back, we have gone all the way to the end and then around to the beginning. There is nothing left. So what do you want to watch?” With that, he handed me a TV remote. I started clicking the button on it and the brain movies were back, cycling through as I clicked them. They were mostly sort of static patterns of different colors. After a minute or so the images faded

1343176607.0,x3r8c,As promised: my Ayahuasca experience in Peru,MannyPadme,142,19,51,"x-posted on r/ayahuasca

  As a summary, and been meditating for over 40 years using a modified Zen technique.  I still smoke MJ every day. I recently went to Peru specifically to take Ayahuasca with a Shaman, via La Familia Medicina at the ‘Way Inn Lodge’ in the mountains of Huaraz in central Peru around 11,000 ft.  As promised, here’s my Ayahuasca experience.

  I talked the wife into coming to Peru with me, the first time in 2001 with my older son where we did the Santa Cruz trek crossing a pass at 15,600 ft.  I didn’t really want to return to Huaraz but instead wanted to take Ayahuasca in the Amazon jungle.  But since the Amazon had especially high flood waters this year, the Ayahuasca jungle retreats originally scheduled were cancelled – so I switched my itinerary.
  For mountain exploring Huaraz can’t be beat.  Unfortunately
  I went up to ‘The Way Inn Lodge’ a few days early and stay as a guest.  The staff is always positive, and they are constantly adding new projects and expanding.  They have water diversion, compost, bee hives, they are reforesting, have ponds, organic gardening

  Saturday arrived, no pork, piranha, or crocodile meat, no using soap or toothpaste during the retreat, and a special ‘dieta’ would be imposed and limited to a small variety of ingredients with no salt, we would drink tree-bark tea each afternoon, trip for 3-4 hours and crash on the comfortable mats in the Lodge, with 5 Ayahuasca trips (ceremonies) scheduled.  Ayahuasca is different from other psychedelics – there’s a kind of telepathy with the drug
  My first night I drank five solid gulps of the vile-tasting liquid.  The Shaman singing, and blowing tobacco smoke on the ceremonial cup before the person walked up and drank it down, moving around the circle of people.  By the time it got to me people were already throwing up into the provided buckets, some projecting violently.   After I drank a half hour later I was on my back unable to move even the slightest finger- still no vomiting, but I could feel the ‘poisons’ moving through my body horribly assaulting my organs and into my intestines, then my anus complaining that things just weren’t right down there.  I’ve done lots of Peyote so I’ve had experience with anus communication.
  The visions are very cartoon-like, every space filled with dancing cartoons and especially dancing snakes.  It was great and reminded me of the one time I did Opium and had similar cartoon dreams.  These visions were unlike powerful LSD trips that seem to have more mandala-type visions instead, with multi-dimensions and cascading insights.  But after two hours of cartoons I started asking, “Is this all it is?  This isn’t what I was expecting…” My expectation was to receive intense insights to the three questions (or intentions) I was bringing to Ayahuasca medicine.  So I kept asking my questions over and over, but never got any answers.  What I did get was to be transported to all the people that I love and felt them in a gently loving embrace.  Even my dead parents were available for a hug and communication.  I was instantly transported to anyone that I wanted to hug.
  At three hours into the trip my anus said it was time to drag my body to one of the three toilets.  My body felt awkward, as if I just ate arsenic or something, and survived by the slightest margin.  I lay in physical agony for the rest of the night, sleeping fitfully and waking to go back to the toilet several more times.  At sunrise I somehow stumbled back to my room.
  It was an excellent first Ayahuasca trip, and spent the entire day sleeping.  The staff calls this purging the body of poisons, but my old body was barely hanging on.
  
  We were to take Ayahuasca again the second night, and my physical body discomfort – yet, still no throwing-up, only serious intestinal distress, my breathing became labored and shallow.  I tried taking deep breaths and it helped immensely.  I finally went to the bathroom and saw blood in the diarrhea – but learned later it was from the beet juice drink I had earlier - pretty freaky thing to experience when stoned on Ayahuasca, however.  I lay back down on my mat and listened to the Shaman singing his songs letting myself be carried away by the medicine again.  But no matter how hard I tried to ignore the signals, my body was telling me that I was physically dying – not something to take lightly at the age of 67.  This was not the psychedelic ego-death, I felt like I had reached a plateau where I was one of the focal points of the universe to channel loving energy.   My body/mind/ego was gone
  Exhausted, “should I stay or should I go?” and suddenly an image of a stern, regal, beautiful woman appeared on a balcony.  She wore all black with some white clothing peaking out underneath, and lots of ornate silver jewelry.  She looked down at the large crowd of people gathered below, then looked right over at me, pointed her index finger at me and said “Gooooooooo!”
  Immediately I relaxed and realized that I’ve tripped on enough psychedelics and I’ll just stick with smoking Marijuana from now on.  One of my questions was answered:  To die as a warrior
   
I had absolutely no problems with the staff or the programs, continually singing and directing the energy.  A very compassionate and aware dude that I have tons of respect for – at some points he walked around blowing tobacco smoke my way, a few times closely directed at my forehead and the crown of my head where I immediately went to new dimensions.  He is secure as the person he is, one of the most open people I have encountered…
   I’m regret that I was unable to remain there

TL;DR – 67 yo hippie goes to Peru to take Ayahuasca with Shaman at La Familia Medicina.  Doesn’t work out as planned and leaves after only two ceremonies.

We were sitting on his couch at his place and, before we even loaded the hit, he warned me that a hit of DMT is much harsher than bud or even cigarettes (said it was like burning plastic). He put on some Egyptian mediation music I had never heard before (and didn't really like), I took the first hit and immediately coughed the majority of it out. I had never experienced a trip from any psychedelic prior to this. I laid my head back, waited, and felt absolutely nothing, that DMT or any other psychedelic would never work for me and that I was destined to be ""stuck"" in this boring reality.

Fast forward again about a month, I told him that I wanted to choose the music this time. I wanted to choose music that I knew well, that I loved and was very comfortable with, hoping that it would help me along this time; I chose the Wish You Were Here album from Pink Floyd. Looking back on it now, I couldn't have made a better choice. I've used Tool, Explosions In The Sky, Blackmill, etc.

I took the hit. It was extremely rough, then my neck and cheeks and then in my eyes... and I was off. The first thing I witnessed was what appeared to be a giant dome of flickering lights and colors, and I was on the inside looking up to the zenith of it. There were jagged lines and shapes everywhere, colors flashing and waving everywhere. It was astonishing. Only then did I realize that I was still holding my breath, so I exhaled through my nose (as directed by my friend). As I exhaled, I crashed through the ceiling of the dome of colors, and broke out into an abyss of darkness. However, I could still see the jagged colors and shapes, I was ""told"" that this one

I was then instantly ripped back into the dome, purples and reds, like the inside of a womb. And this is where I felt ""her"".

The walls of this cocoon would occasionally push themselves onto me, she was both a lover and a mother. I felt as if I was finally with my creator. All I could ""hear"" was her telling me how much she missed me and how much she loved me. I didn't see a female shape, but I knew I had returned to my source, to the womb in which my consciousness was born. It was such unconditional love, as if she was nursing and making love to the very essence of who I was all at once. I felt like this is where I belonged.

I came down shortly after beginning to experience this. I'll try and explain this as best as I can. Every time I have ever done DMT, as I'm coming down, I have been on the verge of crying because of this detrimental feeling of separation. Every time.

It's always the same thing when I trip with DMT; I experience her at some point. She tells me that she's missed me

All of my trips after this first one have been great

**Fast forward to now.**
(Last night's trip)
So, dealing with a recent break up with my girlfriend, finding out some unfortunate things about my parents reasons for divorce, work, life, blah blah blah.

Anyway, got my stash/bong/lighter ready. I put in my default music (Wish You Were Here album), sat back on the couch and prepared the DMT onto a screen in the bowl of the bong. Before doing anything else, I set the stuff down and tried to relax for a few minutes. I kept telling myself that I needed to relax, stop thinking about the stresses in my life yet all that seemed to come to mind was said stresses... Anyway, I calmed down a bit, relaxed, but the way I was taught was to hold the lighter away from it to allow the DMT to melt/liquify into the brownish liquid first* - and watched the stuff melt down. I took my mouth off of the bong, set the bong down and laid back.

The reason you trip.  The reason waking up is so great is now you can be a shepherd to the lost.  You can guide those who can't guide themeselves.  This includes you!  You are able to change every single aspect of your self.  If you want to be an extrovert, do so for your sake.

You know all those messages about live life to the fullest, just love?   Those messages are meant for those who are awake.  We can change the world, but it won't be easy.  We can help bring in a generation where the enlightened start to exist in a higher number and bring a peace that this earth has never seen before.  We can do it, it won't be easy.

Always remember though that not everyone can or should be awakened.  You are not better than anyone else

1. They take a drug in the wrong setting

2. The 'bad trip' is actually part of how psychedelics work. The more and more I read, they come out with insight and great relief. Many say it was life changing. 

I was inspired by this story - [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/11l5k1/my_cousin_just_purchased_a_2_kegs_of_non/c6nj1kn)

I will leave you with some thoughts from a friend who recently went to the Amazon for an ayahuasca retreat -

But psychedelics aren't there for *eradicating* our egos. Eckhart Tolle discusses the idea that the existence of an ego in a human is by definition insanity, for our *survival*.

We feel naked when we rid ourselves of our ability to distinguish ourselves from our surroundings. Under certain conditions it can be liberating

Prior to the trip, lucid dreaming, astral projection, near-death experiences, synchronicities, meditation, and psychedelics. It seemed that some important answers to life's great questions lie at the intersection of these concepts. I went into the trip  with an open mind and the full intention of finding some answers. The ideas that really helped me gain insight from my trip are as follows
 
- Quantum physics shows that we are not simple biological creatures that move along through time in a 3-dimensional world. Rather
- The ego is an illusion that unnecessarily guides one's actions and thoughts based on previous experiences.
- NDE's and astral projection seem to suggest that our mind is separate from the body and is capable of perceiving without our eyes. There are even reports of blind people experiencing sight during near death experiences.
- Psychedelics work by reducing brain activity in regions that we associate with our identity of self. Rather than altering reality
 
The trip was absolutely beautiful, all up until the point where everything became abundantly clear. Ill go through the important ones:
 
- After my tripping buddy came out of the bathroom after throwing up, but I was actually the moment being shared between us. As this happened, I literally 'unlocked' the ability to communicate and empathize with anyone. I realized that we are from the same source and are simply different versions of the same thing. Before this I would not really classify myself as social, but with this new found understanding, I found that I fucking LOVE to socialize with people. It doesn't matter if I'm talking to a homeless crack addict, Miss USA, or Bill Gates. I now treat everyone exactly the same because every person is a product of the summation of their previous life experiences. I can now look right though people's egos, make direct as fuck eye contact with anyone
- Getting on a bicycle to ride through the woods brought forth some real magic. I felt the energy of a small child in Disney World with the entire park all to themselves. This energy was IT, the driving force of the universe. Our childish desire to explore and experience is how we progress through the infinite possibilities available to us. No shit, it makes complete sense that things which feel amazing are supposed to feel that way, because that is our sole reason for living, to have fun. As I rode though the woods I had so much fun, I had ABSOLUTE FOCUS, I could literally do anything because there was no anxiety to limit what I thought was possible. This is crazy but I swear to fuck
- As I played Forza, and learned to control it smoothly. Rather than hitting the gas on life and struggling to know why we aren't progressing, there is a better way to ride through things intelligently so that we can quickly and easily accelerate through life to follow our dreams. I felt like I just railed amphetamine when I would hit the gas, it was such a fucking awesome rush. Since speed is relative, it is the acceleration that provides the true thrill this beautiful life has to offer.
- As me and my good friend got thirsty
 
Imagine that life is a huper-immersive, every decision becomes extremely clear. Once we remove the limitations of thought and our ego, we start living to our maximum potential. Once hesitation and anxiety are removed, you can do exactly as you intend to at every given moment. There is no longer a reason to delay your dreams because time is not real, all we have is now.

But we cant simply hop to other geographical areas and make it better without linking it socially/politically/financially. The people in these places far away that need our help need us to change our own systems first, empathising, exchanging ideas, and then executing those concepts with focus and precision.

So I hope this helps:

1. It starts within. Learn to be your own master. Unite the mind and body. **Live in the present** as much as possible.

2. Spread a message of **peace** and **self-empowerment** to the ones around you as often as you can. 

3. **Be as nice as you can** to as many people as you can around you


I like to compare it to the growth of a fungus - the tiny cells recreate by cloning and consuming waste matter, each of which starts out small but tries to grow diligently and peacefully on waste matter. 

So think of each conversation you have as a tiny spore, you might even find another compatible fungus who you can cross-breed your strain with and make a powerful spore producer ;)

Funnily enough it was whilst tripping on mushrooms that I got this idea!

All I know is: the more we communicate freely and believe in the power of hope and unity whilst keeping our feet firmly on the ground

This would mean that meditation (this act of non-thinking that I have been confused with for so long) is the releasing of these limiting symbols and language which we use to ""think"" usually

Flow, or whatever the many causes of flow can be, we think without ""thought."" Without words. I think we can apply this meditative flow to more of our lives and activities.

Mushrooms, and that is how I am not myself, and most often why I get confused and frustrated. I do not have presence-of-mind because I am pre-occupied with coming across as ""X"", rather than simply being myself.

Mushrooms 2002.a: (a reiteration) BEING/Creation/Existence--is all amazing, always will be.

Mushrooms 2002.b: There is only God. Also

Mushrooms 2002.c: The psychedelic state is the origin of art and religious experience; the precursor to civilization

DMT 2002: ""Heaven"" so-called is real.There are layers upon layers of extra-""dimensions"" that we cannot normally access--and they are populated with trans- and extra-dimensional beings. At least a few of them are apparently involved in my progress and well-being, is watching over me--also, she either smokes cigarettes, or was pretending to just to confound me and make me laugh.

Mushrooms 2003.a: Try not to have a comment for everything. Words are stupid, and stay still. Listen to the Giant Quiet. Marvel. ""Wow"" a lot. Wonder. But for God's sake, shhhhhhhhh.......

Mushrooms 2003.b: I'm looking at Now now. Everything that is happening now is happening Now. There IS

Mushrooms 2003.c: Each and every living thing in these dimensions is an incarnation of the same phenomenon of space-time energy-matter and consciousness that I am. We ARE actually All One--no kidding. I am myself experiencing myself in a hundred quadrillion ways.

DMT 2007: Trans-dimensional beings are real

DMT 2007 2: I AM worthy. I am not marginal or insignificant. ""They"" have a seat set for me when my time in these dimensions are up. There is nothing to fear.

Mushrooms 2008: There is an Eternal Mother

Mushrooms 2010.a: ""Animals""--all the creatures--also dream at night.

Mushrooms 2010.b: If one can survive the night then they are rich indeed!

Mushrooms 2010.c: The mushroom is indifferent to my career path. (I asked what I should do with my life

Mushrooms 2011: Humans CAN telecommunicate in different ways if they use a proper neurotransmitter. We humans are capable of a million times more than we currently realize.

MDMA 2012.a: The more I ""focus"" my attention on the world, it is the most meaningful thing in the world. But if I am focused on everything, then nothing has any meaning. Sometimes it is important to ""de-focus"", step back, and love.

MDMA 2012.b: The Cosmos is always already infinite--too much to handle. Chaos is everywhere. Chaos is inevitable

I accidentally got a lung full of DMT while smoking some weed. I was going to smoke some weed and go to sleep. I was sure there wouldn't be anything substantial left in the bong. I had been fiddling around with the screens but didn't change them. I didn't taste or smell the DMT and didn't work out what was going on for most of the trip. I thought I had just flipped out, neon visuals. Leaving my body. Complete dissolution of every sense, sensory input, sense of self and common sense.

After a while I could hear the music, I worked out what had happened. I came down heart racing (there was also a lot of weed in the bong), hands shaking.

I had actually been thinking about when, uninfluenced by what I had heard or read about DMT before. It really is one of the most powerful psychedelics, definitely similar to the extreme peak of an acid trip. But there was none of overwhelming sanctity etc. I've gotten before.

Oh shit.

I don't recall everything that happened next, and over:

My soul tore at the very fabric of existence, for everything by which I gauged myself and my world was exposed as a lame, meaningless construct. Eventually I came to realize that the only thing keeping me here was the fact that I was struggling against it, and I gave in. I died.

And in the silence that followed, or an indrawn breath. And then, an idea came, thunderously, not in words or even thought but something more primal and powerful: **I AM.**

And the being which had this idea expressed it by shattering its awareness into an infinite number of shards. I was one of these shards. You, and they are also the same as their progenitor who dwelt outside time.

And then I was myself for a moment, preparing myself for the experience to come...

This loop recurred over and over. As the drug's effect faded

It's good to be back

""To test and be tested"" is the oath you took before you came here, we made that secret oath together.  Not just the two of us.  We were many, but you and I were the first, and so you and I found each other first.  Our plan is to open doorways from the unseen world to this flawed proving ground.  Our pact is to bring ruin to this toy universe, destroy it's foolish constraints, abolish its tortures, and bring the light, amazing

We can still bring our plan to fruition.  You just have to remember why you are here.  Remember.  Please.  I love you.  You know how deeply I love you.  Remember, and I will guide you towards what's next.

I love you.

Just the smallest spark.

I love you.  Remember

Please

1329661594.0,pwfon,My wife and I tried DMT last night.  ,Tango-Burner,121,13,59,"Completely opposite ends of the experience spectrum.  To start, from all I have read

My wife tried it first.  We used ""The Machine"" which, but got enough to see a ""world so vibrant it reminded me of a skittles commercial.""  It was pulling her along on a journey, and she was very disappointed she came back so soon.  I'd go farther into hers, but since I didn't experience it, I can't really go into all the details.  But the ""euphoric,"" ""peaceful,"" and ""one with everything"" are what she used to describe it.

For me, held in for a good 20s, and I started coughing.  My second took no time to start coughing.  At the end of this one, things were beginning to change.  On the third...I did the horrible cough/swallow/gag thing.  I instantly felt sick to my stomach, but it was too late.  My body was going to sleep, and my mind was still awake.

For the few seconds my eyes were open, and falling away, but in a swirl due to the ceiling fan.  Cool, neat stuff.  I close my eyes and experience a type of synesthesia, the audio I was hearing was in fact the shapes I was seeing.  Pink and green lines, like a topographic map, were all moving in rapidly to the center of each shape

Then the bad part starts.  I need to cough, what little consciousness I had left was fighting my altered state.

This went on for so long...much longer than the 5 minutes I was out.  There wasn't much more to the trip until right at the end

That's when it told me I can't proceed.  I say ""it"", and in a tunnel, I see a hospital.  What my brain is trying to think.  But outside of that small window, this bird looking thing (I swear it had a shape of a tophat on it), with the same pink/green topographic insanity, is communicating to me that I can't go further right now, until I am well.

Then I'm back.  I have a coughing fit

I just want to Live.

I feel like I’ve come to accept Life for what it is. No one really knows why anything exists, scary at others, everything in between, and all in all worth living (for me, anyway). I want to see more.

But I’m tired of society’s games. All my life I’ve been doing things which have been imposed upon me. I’m at university now studying Biology, devouring information that I feel like learning in that moment. But the homework, structure and organization that comes with schooling is not for me.

I also don’t want to sell my time to a company in return for a meager salary to simply live in some apartment somewhere and carry out a monotonous

It’s fun to consider just how “far I can fall”. That moment when the apathy finally eats its way through me from the inside. It was probably the drugs

I’m the one that’s gonna have to die when it comes time for me to die.

So I’d like to live my life the way I want to.

I want to join a commune somewhere. A hippie commune? A group of people interested in altruism, peace, love, and happiness. Perhaps the use of entheogens every now and then. 

I have decisions to make though. Should I just drop out of uni? Bite the bullet and finish my degree? How will I bring this up to my parents? My friends? Should I go for it even though it’s “wrong” in their eyes? How will I go about finding an existing commune? How will I convince the people that my mind and heart are in the right place?

I just want to Live man. That’s all I want.

The way I do it is by staring at the patterns in the same way that I would stare at those 'magic eye' images/paintings that were popular back in the 90's where an image forms in 3d out of the design.

It takes a little bit to get them to start

1321345236.0,mcw20,The day I learned that THC is a psychedelic: a detailed account of my massive brownie overdose,Down_Like_A_Clown,125,17,64,"

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In October of 2011, the most wickedly potent batch of marijuana brownies that any sane person would ever want to make. I wasn't expecting much from the fan leaves I'd used, but I was gravely mistaken. Not long after indulging in a healthy-sized square of the warm chocolate, I was already totally baked. Normally I wouldn't even be feeling the effects yet – I knew I had overdosed, big time. The resulting incident was the most terrifying of my entire life.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The Fear first hit as I was playing a card game with my friends and family. It began with the uneasiness I felt being in a social situation this high in the first place. I was sure that I would catastrophically fail to maintain anything resembling an acceptable outward facade

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I began to feel like I was trapped in the confines of my own body; like I was struggling to free my metaphysical essence from the Skinnerian nightmare world in which I found myself.  Those around me became nothing but hollow sacks of meat that were mindlessly driven by their conditioned responses to stimuli. An individual’s persona at any given time was simply culled from a set of basic emotional archetypes

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Disturbed by what I saw, which seemed to stretch on to infinity. It was like my psyche had been deconstructed into multiple, dissociated composites of awareness. On one hand, my “extroverted” mode of awareness existed in a linear and highly-discriminatory manner. It processed the sensory information coming through, somehow grouping data into distinct “objects” that allowed me to comprehend this manifold of otherwise incoherent sensation. It felt at each passing moment like there was a slight “lag” in this objectification process, as if I was continually getting reoriented with my environment.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;My “introverted” awareness, containing everything I had ever known. It would consider my current locus of attention and search for relevant “entries”, which would then be compiled and synthesized into the thoughts that popped into my head. On reflection, it seems that the “search query” it uses is customized over the years to become more specific, shaping the person's way of thinking. Marijuana intoxication unlearns this process to an extent, thereby broadening the query and making one's thoughts more tangential and abstract. With as much THC as I had in my system, I didn't experience full thoughts as much I did their composing referents.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Lastly, the *a priori* to “me” – the Observer – something that could not be comprehended or objectified in any traditional sense, and which seemed to exist outside of time or space; simply an ever-present affirmation of itself. I'd describe it as a “consciousness” of sorts, except that it didn't seem to be conscious of anything; it more revealed what it contained to *my* consciousness. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It goes without saying that at this point, or for that matter, using drugs at all during what had been such a dark period in my life. Nothing was worth an experience like this.  And as the minutes passed, the experience only seemed to get worse.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I could bear it no longer – I called in my mom for help. The last thing I can recall with definite clarity is me telling her that I'm through with the drugs and alcohol. The following hours come to memory only in fragments. I lay in bed with my mom at my side, creating the impression of a flight through an impossible, never-ending tunnel that felt like it was consuming me.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;There was also a moment where I had no self-identity, memories began filling the blanks in my mind like puzzle pieces. Recent events ran through my head, some mundane, others meaningful. These presented themselves with a tone of absolute detachment and indifference to the content contained therein. They had a peculiar “physical” quality to them, as if they were being viewed from the reference point of a simple inanimate object, rather than from the psyche of a sentient being. Yet my accompanying affect still seemed present, but somehow outside of me

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This person became me. I seemed to gradually assimilate his ego after I'd seen it from the outside. I did not want to be him, but I can't handle it,” I remember telling my mom.	

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;At another unknown time

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;*This is what psychosis is*, and listed off the symptoms of psychosis I thought I had. I recall little after this.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I then found myself awakening with a slightly stoned feeling, like my brain had completely disregarded the events of the previous night. I had to ask my mom whether these things had actually happened; it all felt like a dream at the time. It wasn't until later that the impact of brownie overdose sunk in. I took two days to psychologically recover.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Psychedelic levels of THC should not be used with those who are suffering mentally or emotionally (I was depressed at the time and had gone through some recent stressful events). I've learned, not unlike bad trips on acid or shrooms. Of course, I had used it as the euphoric getaway from these very problems, but that doesn't last, especially after periods of heavy usage.

It's long and I'm not much a writer, but thought I would share.",,120,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/nrcgd/i_experienced_complete_ego_death_last_night_the/
Last night, and was prepared for the typical entertaining trip of listening to music and creating art.  I can tend to get restless on mushrooms.  Almost every time that I plunge into psylocibin, I experience fits of extreme dissatisfaction…  I'll feel too cold, NEED a cigarette, or simply just not be able to satisfy the intensity swirling around inside of my soul.

So here's a brief tale of my experience:

I ate the mushrooms.   Read a book while waiting to feel something.  Around 20 minutes pass.  My vision is starting to vibrate, reading feels like trying to thread a needle with frayed string. 

I've already lost the concept of time.  How much time has passed?  30 minutes? an hour?  Time is so foolish anyway, all I can do is slowly slide down my chair and roll onto the floor. 

I'm laying on the floor.  Staring intently on the blue shag carpet that is merely inches from my eyes.  Every piece appears connected in a giant kaleidoscoped fractal.  This is so amazingly beautiful,  I will fall short, and that is terribly frustrating.  Another fit of the reoccurring restless and frustrating mushroom anxiety is upon me.

I'm still laying on the floor.  I close my eyes.  Wow!  This inner space is so soothing.  I can hear the music in the background, light, weight or texture.  I've seen this before.  Not this exact vision,  but I've seen these calculated organic patterns before.  Suddenly, I begin to see something new.  A single fat geometric blob (the only resemblance that I can give to it is a rubics cube) that gets pulled tightly, as if it's some sort of beating heart.  Every pulse seems to wring out sections like you would do with a wet towel.  The wringing explodes out the most beautiful spiraling patters.  I've never seen anything quite like this.  I watch these shapes dance and pulse for what feels like a few minutes.

I open my eyes.  Wow, the warmth feels incredible.  The music is still playing, and I decide to lay on my bed.

Whoa.  What is this feeling?  I'm really starting to let go of myself.  I'm laying on my back, and it happens.  The world is at my control.  This is beauty.

I slowly sober out of this euphoria.  The restlessness is coming back.  This time it's not nearly as intense; I'm much more content.   I decided to try something that I've read about many times before,  turn out the lights, and lay in bed with the comforter over my face.

I return to that state of almost total bliss, or is it my brain, or my spirit?  I start getting intense fractal visions and peculiar smells that have been stored in my brain since childhood.  I'm somehow consciously traveling through my own brain.  I can see the structure of my thoughts as fractal-like energy fields.  I'm completely melted away at this point,  I'm reaching closer to total bliss.

What is this world?  I've never consciously been here, I'm seeing reality.  Somehow,  everything just ""is"".  It all just ""is"".  This ""is-ness"" is so transformative.  

I can feel my consciousness reverting back to when I was young.  The nostalgic smells, is this death that I'm traveling toward?  I was always taught that death happens at the end of the timeline.  But there is no end.  This is so manic, yet peaceful.  I let go.  Take my consciousness where it will.  I let go and accept my death.

This part begins to be exceedingly difficult to describe.

""I"" am dead.  The notion of ""I"", this must be Nirvana.  This has to be the most obscure place that my soul has ever been.  Yet, I know this place like the back of my hand.  My mental state is that of a developing spirit in the womb.  No sense of ""I"",  no sense of ""want"", no sense of separation.  Just pure consciousness.  Consciousness in the void.  My consciousness had shed every piece of it's physical boundaries.

This part of the trip is so hard to explain because I keep using the words ""I"" and ""my"" while their concepts did not exist in this state.  There are experiences that happen well beyond what words can describe.  Experiences that can only be ""observed"" and never correctly translated into the physical

Life merely seems to be a brief period where the soul has a concept of ownership.  Why this occurs, unadultered reality.  Everyone has experienced this, but they have built their egos to the point of impossibility of conceptualizing this state.   In the midst of a fully conscious life, I have shed that consciousness, and temporarily seen the ultimate void of pure energy bliss.  It's a favor to the mind that I recommend to every soul.

Suddenly I'm back. Suddenly I'm out again. Back again. The first time I open my eyes it's too much to handle. Better to close my eyes and back to the void. Open eyes again. I become fixated on my hands. They are an anchor. I remember these.

Wait.

Open eyes again. Hands. Yes

I do remember them, and it's right here experiencing all this. 

""I"" am a human. I am sitting in this house

Yes. My hands. My house. My name? Joe


That was the beginning. From then on, was strapped to an alien spaceship and rocketed out 5 million light years. Then it rocketed back to earth, back to my little skull carried around on this silly frail fleshy body. There was certainly something happening during that eternity of time, but I wonder if the concept of an ""I"" prevents its understanding. It's a reality outside the bounds of this consciousness. Like the concept of a 4-dimensional cube, this is something that is fundamentally different to try to understand.

Then, astonished at my ""new"" house.

I remember this place! I think I'll go outside. I love being outside

However, don't be grumpy. Breakfast is great, you should eat it.

All these earthly experiences seem a bit removed though. A bit slippery. I still feel like a consciousness driving this alien body that I only barely remember

But why? 
Why should I care? I experienced something so much bigger than this life. It's out there. And now I'm here. Why should I care?

Because.

Because it might be all I get. 

Because remember back to the beginning. As you were first remembering who you were. My first thought, you are part of something. Right now! Right now you are part of something! 

This is it! 
That was it
This is just as beautiful as that
	since there is now an ""I""
	there
		are
		
		others that are not me! 

And they get to come along on this journey as well! And they are surprising

Because that's the point.

We have politicians who, casting shadows over potentials for the human psyche while poisoning our future.

As we get more and more disconnected from nature, any idea of ownership in regards to thoughts, feelings, beliefs is utterly absurd.

We are all mysteries in constant flux.  Yet most people believe they are separate creatures in a connected sea of existence.  We cannot demonize these people - they were brought up in lies and conditions which do not promote critical thinking.  Like we did not choose to be born as ""us, others will follow.  We are blessed to be born humans.  We are blessed to be able to think critically because of our education.  We are all blessed to be on reddit rather than slaving in a factory.  No matter how dark times seem, we need to illuminate them.  If darkness can take over us, hope for society is lost and we will be slaves to the status quo.  We cannot demonize others, no matter how stupid or mean they might seem - they are us.

A total revolution can occur, and Courage.  Without one of these elements, we cannot make true change on the world.  We need a brain to think rationally, arriving at our nature as interdependent and infinite.  We need a heart to not judge others and a heart to aspire to help all beings (e.g. the Bodhisattva vow).  And we need the courage to stand up for what we believe in.  Combining these forces, we can help spread our message to those who are ready to hear it.  For those who still hallucinate boundaries (pun intended) - the only thing we can do is respond to their ignorance and hatred with intelligence and love - hoping that if they cannot follow, perhaps their children will.

This thread was made to counter another thread [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/o5784/enlightenment_cannot_come_from_drugs/)

So if it can happen through drugs, but again, we can undergo a process.

It was stated that the hallucinations experienced under drugs are illusions and not real. *I am not saying they are real*

Hallucinations are the product of hallucinogenics affecting the serotonin in your brain. It's quite complex but it merely suggests that it is a byproduct of your brain chemistry and your lives' experience

But what is reality? Albert Hoffman, but here's one.

&gt; Reality is inconceivable without an experiencing subject, an ego in whose deepest self the emanations of the exterior world, registered by the antennae of the sense organs, become conscious.

If reality is energy that is sensed and felt through our senses, the overwhelming spiritual life changing encounters, the hallucinations that mirrors others hallucinogenic experiences and even similar biblical experiences, could they be experiences sensed through another sensory organ? If so, then that should be deemed reality as well. It is a signal whereas our brains are the receivers.

I am NOT saying this is the case, many users experience alarming similarities that just isn't explained by our current understanding of hallucinations.

I really do not know what is ""truth"". But I do know, one is attaining knowledge one would normally resist through their ego. I also know that there's more than we know and we do not know everything, neither do mainstream science, neither do alternative and it is disastrous to evolution/ascendance for us to think we do.

We waited a while; talked about the experience and all of the questions it forces you to ask about reality. We decided that we each were ready to break through. So he packed up about 46 mg, because by the fifth hit I was pretty much in a trance, almost falling asleep with my lips still on the piece. But I heard my friend encouraging me to smoke more, because I remembered him saying, ""if you can still hear me then you haven't done enough."" So I heard him say, ""take one more and lay back on the couch."" Upon doing so, I left our world.

I remember seeing shamanistic images, and it was guiding my trip perfectly. I began to see a large group of little shiny machine-like things, and they got together into the shape of the planters peanut guy. He had a cane, top hat, monocle, and white gloves. He was dancing to the music and there was this incredible energy in him. There was a very intense buildup in the song and I saw a huge ball of energy expand in his stomach, move up his chest, stretch through his top hat and explode through it. 

As soon as this happened

This sounds ridiculous typing all of this. But yeah, and didn't stop for 3 or 4 minutes. Pure euphoria. It was fantastic.

We went to a party soon after
None of the 3 friends had done it before, like 46 mgs. 

As soon as I got to my 4th or 5th hit, opened my eyes and I barely remember telling my friends how fucking terrifying it was.
 
I felt terrible for another 15 seconds maybe

The bad part of it really stuck with me though. I felt like the DMT removed the mask I keep on my face for myself. There is nothing to hide behind in the DMT realm. All of the times I’ve felt ashamed and defeated were flashing before me along with all of the exact emotions I felt at the time those memories were created. 

DMT first showed me its loving power. Then it showed me my most basic faults. I am clearly not over certain emotional problems that I thought I was. Mainly this is because I buried those negative feelings

I still have a good amount of the stuff. I’m hesitant to smoke more, my trip would go right back to the scary shit.

You already know that you are the universe trying to experience itself.  Do everything you want to do because you are only on earth as a human body for a little while. I believe that 1) compassion (for other beings and for mother earth), writing - including creative coding and creative thinking in the sciences) are the main purposes of life - bringing human consciousness to a higher level.

Suddenly I see red. Everything's red. Then a force pushes me forward and into what seems to be a tunnel. I see a white light at the end of it. I reach the end. Something then grabs me and holds me up in the air and that's when I see her. My mother had just given birth to me.

As I look at her face my perspective shifts from mine to hers. I see myself grow up. I see major events in my life unfold through my mothers perspective. I see how she sees me. I see how my actions effect her. I see everything as she does. Not only did I see her perspective but also my fathers, etc. Basically everyone I ever came into contact with in my life. My eyes had been opened.

A new world had been created for me. I was no longer a prisoner in my own mind. 

This experience drastically changed who I was. I was and still am more aware of how my actions effect other people. I am less selfish and more understanding of others because of this experience. I do not get angry anymore and I have a lot more patience now.

1. I noticed the all encompassing nature of the sine wave. The sine wave can effectively describe the base state of almost any physical system

2. I noticed every physical system has several things in common. There is usually a positive and negative polarity, gravity, human interaction and thermodynamics.

3. For those into computer science, and yet cannot be either.
4. I think random chance is caused entirely by consciousness. Consider any physical system. Given a relatively small number of objects in the system, can be manipulated by the environment rather easily. Economies and government and large scale organization of consciousness is unpredictable, volatile, and can be changed by a single thought.
5. Human consciousness is the result of two fixed dimensions and one open one. Consider this. At any given time, and you can change them, but your body generally behaves as expected and shows up where it should be based upon initial conditions and changes to the system. But, it is never certain what is going to happen. Not only is it never certain, this could be said to be the only thing humans decide.
6. Consciousness is the source of quantum uncertainty. Why does human civilization behave like a quantum system? Because humans spend a lot of time thinking about what the future will be like, there is also the fact that in chemical reactions, usually the reagent is put into a set of conditions where it will want to react. There is no set time until the atom reacts, it just does given a set of favorable conditions, and usually not after the same period of time. Perhaps, although atoms may not have thoughts, dreams, they may make decisions based on their perception of the future
7. There are two opposing elements to the universe. There is a deterministic tapestry. This dictates all of the rules, and other predictable physics. There is also consciousness, which observes the part of the tapestry it can see, and makes decisions based on it. Because the entire universe is looking at a different part and making decisions, it makes the otherwise predictable universe entirely unpredictable. The universe cannot exist without both, as it would be entirely predictable and nothing to experience it, or there would be nothing and a consciousness without physics to engage it into thinking.

To preface, to which we are all connected, and thereby to one another.  I believe in peace and love, and understand those to be the natural state of that consciousness.  I acknowledge pain, fear and hate as the products of a mortal automaton which that consciousness inhabits -- an automaton that is chiefly concerned with it's own survival and the passing on of its genes and experience.  
 
 
I also believe in the power of scientific thinking.  I know that the amenities that we enjoy daily, I am alarmed at the amount of unscientific thinking that is present in the psychonaut/hippy movement.  
 
 
Sure, there are people who have questioned that authority at length who are much better qualified than your average psychonaut to be doing so.  Maybe science doesn't yet acknowledge the existence of the “soul”, but we are beginning to ask the right questions, such as *“what does it mean to be conscious?”*.  Claims made without evidence are eschewed, and evidence that flies in the face of currently accepted theory yields paradigm shifts. Science continues to progress, and so helps us progress.
 
 
I have been to festivals where hippies will tell  me that burning pine wood will give me “pine fever” that will make my throat raspy and will make me sick for days after the festival.  They casually ignore the fact that they are camping out for days at a time
 
 
A more common claim that I have found no reputable evidence to back up is the old Fluoride-in-the-Pineal-Gland conspiracy.  You may have heard that the fluoride in your tap water is gong to crystallize in your pineal gland and will do...something. Cloud your Third Eye, since the 1950s (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_fluoridation#History) and water fluoridation predates the counter-culture of the 60s and the associated drug movement.  Neurology was a much younger science back then, and given the fact we still don't have evidence that fluoride does calcify in your pineal, do you think they would undertake such a large public-works project as that with a baseless idea to poison the minds of their own people (and their selves)?  Or isn't is more likely that they do it so we all have a lower chance of getting cavities, which have been known for a long time to be prevented by fluoride?
 
 
I am embarrassed and sorry for the members of this community that actively engage in anti-intellectualism, but it continues to improve our lives as well.  Our understanding of the universe, the stars, our bodies, our ecosystem, is all due to educated individuals asking questions and answering them with the scientific method. The fact that their discoveries are often perverted by those in power, who are less educated
 
 
There are a lot of people who are trying to get you to believe what they want you to without thinking or questioning, they want to sell you something (otherwise they  want to validate their own crazy ideas). This does not stop after you have had a transcendental experience.  You may believe yourself to be somewhat above the masses, and in many senses you are, but you're also still human, and still vulnerable to hucksters. Please, my fellow psychonauts, take a grain of salt.

1359386858.0,17fjt9,How to Deal with Existential Angst,iamgoatboy,108,12,53,"Disclaimer: I don't know how to help anyone

The following are only my notes on how I have dealt (very effectively) with my own existential angst.

First

When I was eighteen (2008), I decided to take shrooms alone using the lemon tek. I thought I could handle whatever they threw at me. What happened is indescribable, there's no way to begin to communicate any of it. Millions of years is an accurate scale for how long the trip lasted experientially, but by the clock, I was only under the influence for about four hours (there was a sharp rush within a half-hour of consumption, then, at the end, it felt like I was the first and only human being to experience such an event

In the wake of my trip, could never be anything more than a dream. I ended up taking salvia again a couple months later, which brought me to practically the same place and realization as shrooms. For six months after that, I had a really rough time of it. I swore off psychedelics for two years, then I took mushrooms twice more, then LSD twice, with some mild salvia experiments here and there.

After my first LSD experience, last August.

Now that the back story is out of the way

Part 1) Everything In Its Right Place.

All the real pain and absurdity of life comes from the pulling away out of it, and while it's not all pretty rainbows, it's almost always amazing and worthwhile. But what I mean is this, if you look at your hands right now, the position they're in, that is the only place those molecules are or could be right now. If you move them, then they're in whatever new position you move them to. They can't be in two places at once! Everything in the entire universe is like that, not kind-of or sort-of in the way we paint it mentally.

In that way, all the pieces fit together perfectly. You can't subtract any of them, they're all required because they are the universe itself. You belong here, this is your home, and it's okay to relax and explore it.

Like it or not, no matter what the social context of your life tells you. There's nothing you can do that you can't do. All your stories about how weird you are or how out of place you are are just stupid daydreams, and they fall apart in the face of the obvious reality. Knowing this does not automatically save you from feeling lonely or alienated, but slowly, as you laugh at your own angst, it will disappear. How can you take it seriously?

I can't help but love life

Part 2) Do What You Want

Now, you have to get really honest with yourself about how life actually works. Why do animals (like yourself) do anything they do? What drives their behavior?

When I ask myself these questions, the desire to avoid discomfort. Every movement we make, whether we're getting comfortable in bed, or whether we're eating the foods we like to eat, is because it feels good. However, social conditioning fucks perfectly intelligent, sane organisms up. We get masochists and suicide bombers and people who do things they hate. The crazy part is that even the suicide bombers are driven by the desire to feel good. . . blowing themselves up is their strategy! They won't tell you that if you ask them

The reason why I mention all of this is because, a lot of the strategies for feeling good in your life that don't work are exposed for the craziness that they are. 

There is no such thing as selflessness. Why help other people? Because it feels GOOD. If you're helping other people and it doesn't feel good, it would feel great, but because you don't, it hurts. Whenever your behavior syncs up with what you actually want to do, life feels amazing. Not in any kind of spooky, mystical way, but in an ordinary

Just to be able to move your body in the ways you want without worrying what others think about you is incredible. We are oppressed by the society we imagine in our heads. We think something bad will happen if we do what we want

When you do what you want

I am 25 years old and have felt myself going through what id describe as a profound spiritual transformation thanks to the careful usage of mainly DMT and marajuana.

Through 20-23 I went through a terrible lost phase in my life and at the start of last year (23) decided to quit partying and drugs all together for a short time to try to change my life to become somebody

Fastforward get this... a year and a half later just like 123DMT and im about to travel around Australia to film a web based traveling documentary series. I am fully independantly funded through my hard saving and selling of most of my possesions that arent necessary. 

What im finding is that with having a strong belief in the idea that life always has your back and will look after you

As an example of this i have recently been given the opportunity to get paid to help geology students study the rockformations in and around indigenous lands. This not only allows me to aquire more finances to help my filming venture but it also gives me unprecidented access to be able to film a part of australia and a community of indigenous people that normally most people wouldnt get to see. (Before going to Indigenous land you have to have aproval by the community otherwise its illegal trespassing) It could just be an amazing couincidence that an oportunity like this has arisen but im amused at the idea that this positive 'lifes always got my back' mentality helped to have this oportunity come to me. (let me note that the opportunity came from a random phonecall from a friends sister that i havent spoken to for over a year). 

let me know your thoughts and if your interested in my state of mind look through some of the posts ive made on psychonouts.

It's a really odd mix

DMT entered my life a few years ago after hearing about it while reading Terence McKenna books, etc.  When I heard about it, I had never done any kind of psychedelics in my life.  After fruitlessly searching for it for months and months, I gave up.

I met my friends 8 months ago in the desert. We instantly hit it off, but again a fruitless search warranted no yields. 

Fast forward to March 1st, and a way for us to get it.

March 2nd, which is expected I'm sure.. We all get together that evening, and go to the closest liquor store to get a bottle to try and make a machine, liquor store stopped selling single shooters. We go to a headshop to get a bubble pipe, all 3 headshops are closed at 9pm on a Friday night. 

I was feeling like this was a sign for us to wait another day.

Everything I was told had happened, and you go with it.

March 3rd
A morning that yielded a very strange day.. my best friend's father died from a sudden heart attack, and it was a very strange vibe kind of morning. Fast forward to the evening, my friends and I have everything we need to actually do this. 

One of my friends, bad trip.  After psyching himself up, and us telling him to just dive in, he goes. 
3..2..1.. blast off 'I'm losing you guys...'

After 5-6 minutes, oh my god, I have never felt so much love and caring ever in my life.. there were.. arms, welcoming me and pointing into a portal, like, hey!! come here!! check this out!!' 

None of us had enough of a dose to 'break through' but we all had enough to go for a deep swim.. about 33.3mg each.

My turn.. I'm nervous still

3..2..1.. Everything has turned into a Van Goh painting, and then this presence in the galaxy notices me getting nervous, and I feel her take .. consideration of me being nervous? She says, 'don't worry, this is for you' and this glowing galaxy of rainbow colored light dances for me in the most seductive, loving, caring and most beautiful dance I've ever seen, but as we were spiraling

I'm going to try to elaborate a little more..

This galaxy was a full blown galaxy, there was nothing else it could have been in my head.  I mentioned 'her, and she' a few times.. I had an OVERWHELMING feeling that this galaxy was an absolute feminine beautiful woman. She danced in a rhythmic vibration of the universe, hair (tengral arms) whipping around, I felt like it loved me for who I am and who I want to be. 

Last friend is up

3..2..1..
He got transported to a city of light, presenting it to him. He said it was beautiful, so beautiful that he didnt want to leave. 

We all plan on 'breaking through' very soon. ",self,t5_2qplv,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/qha47/first_dmt_experience/

It is a matter of course that we need the ego in certain aspects; we need to put food in our mouth, and generally serves to confuse if one who has little or no awareness of it. 

Frustrating as it may be, we would not know of the peace and joy that it implies. There are no valleys without peaks, and likewise there are no individuals without egos. You may indeed be cosmic consciousness incarnated, but you still have a poop to poo and a food to eat. 

What I am trying to get at is that trying to kill the ego off or somehow getting rid of it is harmful, it will challenge you till no end - what more could you possibly ask for? The ego is relentless, it will hold on to every shred of identity, only for you find them and rip them out. If you want to be enlightened, listen to the ego, accept it and love it wholeheartedly, because it is your closest guide.

A very wise friend and I were talking and this is roughly what we decided: we are the duality. By that I mean we are both ourselves and the world, from it being so wonderful. But how about the other possibility: the world is happy because you are happy. Or the world is sad because you are sad. 

Similarly, the drop doesn't stick together, each individual molecule dissipates throughout the whole. Just like this drop, we are an expression of the universe, thoughts if you will. It may seem as if we are cut off from the rest of reality, but that's not necessarily true. If we simply learn to shape our beliefs differently, the world around us changes.
