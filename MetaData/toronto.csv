1348087421.0,105ld0,As a Texan visiting Toronto....,LOLinternetLOL,925,128,571,"Forgive me for ranting but...I have been all over the planet and after spending a few weeks here.... Toronto is hands down my favorite city of all time. 

Living in Houston provides me with extremely minimal public transportation, or at least impoverished. The TTC may have its downsides, but it is phenomenal compared to systems in Los Angeles, Sydney, San Francisco, etc. The subway may look small in scale compared to these other cities, but the quality of service is simply on another level. I can step outside and walk 10 feet to the Ossington/Davenport bus stop

The level of cultural diversity in Toronto is also extremely pleasant to me. Korea town and China town seem so much more comfortably integrated into the cityscape. We have a large section of Houston which is considered ""China town"", we certainly don't get to enjoy the scent of stinky tofu wafting through the air for miles around.

The parks and green areas proliferate within Toronto, Holstein Maibock, Holstein Festbok, ciders,and anything Molson). Truly wish the US would switch to the Canadian style of measuring alcohol content.

Speaking of beer, for food, I was on a hunt to find the best poutine in the city. 

Two poutine places stuck out to me as ever-dependable. ""Come and Get It"" and Smoke's. Smoke's seemed like it was going to be similar to a typical chain restaurant in the states, cheese curds, mushrooms, carmelized onions, gravy) blew me away. I was going back to Bloor St for that poutine at least twice a week. Also Spent quite a bit of time at Future Bakery enjoying their Chicken Schnitzel.

Finally, it had the most kind population I have ever experienced. Even the small cities outside of Houston don't come close to the friendly feel of Toronto. My whole life I've always assumed that southerners are the most friendly people ever, and Torontonians made us look like Parisians....or New Yorkers..(ones that don't give away Gotye tickets). Everywhere I went there were community events going on, free food being given out in neighborhoods, and just an endless amount of effortless diversity. However, this kindness did not always extend to some places....*cough* (Christie station in korea town) *cough*, but overall

There is so much more I could rant on about....the museums...the art galleries...Timmies.....the amount of amazing shows...Honest Ed's.....the GRAFFITI....but I've already spent too much time redditing on the clock at work

In the end, more beautiful, and with a VASTLY lower population of douchebags. I would choose Toronto over NYC a thousand times over. Also, your used video game shops have the best selection I have ever seen. I miss the city already, and hope to be returning soon for some Toronto winter action. 

Peace out y'all

P.S - *Excellent* bud.

On New Years Eve my friend Mike Pimentel and his friends were walking home from the night out when he got caught up in someone else's fight.  

Even though he had nothing to do with it and didn't know the people who were having the altercation in the first place

His family

This picture was taken by someone who was there and is the very best lead that we have at this point to finding someone who knows who killed Mike and why.

I can't even describe what a nice guy Mike was... pretty much the nicest guy you could ever meet.  He would do anything for anyone.  Within minutes of meeting him you just knew he was a good person.

You have no idea how disgusting it is that he was taken the way he was; by a stranger

If you know this woman

It's gross that these people are still out there after what they did.  

Thanks for taking the time to check out the pic... I can only hope it leads to something... anything.

Cheers.

She is fairly timid around strangers. She typically NEVER leaves her mom or my (i'm her long time dog walker) side but she was out for a walk with a family friend who she'd only known for a short time when she took off.

They were walking on the beach at WOODBINE and LAKESHORE (Kew Beach Area

We're doing everything we can to get the word out. If you see her PLEASE let us know even if you can't catch her let us know!

We are desperate to bring her home. Her mom and her pack and I MISS HER SOOOOO MUCH ALREADY!

Thank you so much! http://imgur.com/a/rirwC

UPDATE:  Just got home from doing pack walks today and wanted to take another minute to thank everyone for their attention and effort in passing along my message.  

SO many people got in touch with me with tips and websites

Someone found her walking around at 2am and took her to the Humane Society where they scanned her microchip and got in touch with her mom. She came out with the pack all day today and was running around like the crazy little girl she is

I made sure to give all my dogs extra special hugs and kisses today because I don't know what I do if any of them ever got lost for good.  My heart would be broken.

Thanks again Reddit xoxoxo

Reading the thread mentioned above it's become apparent that many of these scammers have targeted people with the exact same story. If the strategy ain't broke, it's through hearing these stories that we can warn others, particularly tourists or out of towners, and can protect those with kindness to offer from known con artists.

Let's start a list and share our stories. Feel free to correct or add any of the ones I update with.

I was on the train today(earphones on/listening to music) heading northbound to Downsview station. I was on my way to York. It was around 6:00 pm. About 3-4 men got on together around Yorkdale station. I wasn't paying any attention to them until I noticed they were separated, speak for a moment and move back to there spots. I noticed one of the guys staring at me and I knew what was up. My spidey-senses were tingling. I had my laptop and cellphone with me so I was getting mentally prepared to fight for my shit. But I didn't put my phone away cuz I wanted to give these guys the benefit of the doubt. 

At Wilson station they were walking off of the train and I started feeling like a dick for thinking one of them was plotting to rob me. At the corner of my eye I noticed only one of them was off of the train and another was holding the door for some reason. 

AND THEN BAM.

One of the guys snatched this poor girls phone (In her 20's) and they all started running. She chased them downstairs and that was the last I seen of em.

Until something is done about this blatant discrimination I will not be driving and I encourage you to participate as well. 

When the fine for driving without insurance is cheaper than insurance something is wrong.

When your yearly insurance is nearly 10x the value of your vehicle something is wrong.

When people in certain industries can't get to work because insurance is unaffordable something is wrong.

Make things right! Speak to your local MPP now and stop the insurance companies infringing against the charter and protect your right to equality and end discrimination against age

**Edit:**
I've read through every comment and what I've learned is that while the insurance in ~~Toronto~~ Ontario is ridiculously expensive and continuous coverage is totally illogical and years covered/experience would be a better approach there are ways we can lower our rates.

* Use an independent broker but do your own research and shop around as well
* Sign up for a car share (ZipCar) or have a family member put you on as a secondary driver even if you aren‚Äôt driving their vehicle so when you do get your own vehicle you will have had continuous coverage and better star rating which determines your insurance (Thanks Parkesto and NinjaAssasinKitty)
* Use private/incognito mode when doing online quotes. (Respect to ShadowSlave)
* Group Premiums and Discounts
    * accredited driving school
    * being part of a union
    * bundling discount for having your car
* Get your G license ASAP
* Choose your vehicle based on the kind of insurance rate you get
    [A lot of info in here. I haven't even started reading threw it but it looks promising](http://www.facilityassociation.com/docs/manuals/on/ON%20Manual%20Effective%20April%202013.pdf)

i worked there for 2 years, the call opens with a 30+ seconds long automated message, and my phone call would drop around the 20 second mark. i thought it was a reception problem, but my call would drop every time i called, at the **exact** same spot. i asked my buddy to call the hotline, and he told me his call went through to the operator. this led me to believe that they purposely blocked my number, so that i wouldn't be able to reach them and they could just cover up the whole incident.

i can't afford a lawyer to take action against the wrongful dismissal, there are a lot of other cases where starbucks baristas were dismissed with the most ridiculous reasons, and the company still got away with them. there are so many other reasons why everything this company does goes against their core beliefs and values, but i'm not gonna list them now.

I've been commuting by bike (I don't even have my G1) since I've moved to Toronto five years ago, we have to play by the rules.

* Red lights are not rolling stops. This may be the law in other countries, pedestrians were startled and had to stop in their tracks, and the whole situation created a very unsafe environment. I see the behaviour far too often and it makes us all look bad. Even if there's no cars, it's your responsibility to stop at red lights. It's the law, and if you don't like it get off your bike and get on a streetcar.

* When the doors are open on a streetcar

* Use your hand signals. I've seen about one in a hundred cyclists actually use their hand signals. Even if motorists don't know what they mean

* At red lights

Edit: To clarify

* Stay off the sidewalks (this was covered in depth in another thread)

If we all start abiding by the law perhaps we'll get a little more respect from Toronto. Plus when you break the law

For the cyclists that follow the rules of the road

""Yuuuup.""

I've tried tweeting Karen Stintz (it's her ward), but no one does. Literally hundreds of people - everyone on the east side of the building from the 1st to the 6th floor - is either deeply troubled (people like me on the first floor) or mildly annoyed (those lucky bastards on 6). 

They're ruining my home! I can't sleep at night. And no one seems to care! Because it's RioCan and they're building shit and we don't bite the hand that feeds you

I don't know what to do. This is frustrating beyond belief.

edit: By the way, except in special circumstances (like emergency roadworks, I suppose)

edit2: And if you think I'm some old bugger telling people to get off my lawn, this shit fucks me up.

edit3: Check this out: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6GwNcLuQAE

edit3 UPDATE: So, he said. Way more than they've ever had. He said this is a project that this is going to be going on for 6 to 12 months. And they're not going to stop. We have mechanisms to get them to stop - something called a ""landlord-tenant tribunal""? I do think we need to organize. There is no way that this is tolerable. I'm going to need to move out if this continues, really. PM ME IF YOU LIVE IN THIS BUILDING. I'll give you my name and room #, you give me your name and room #, we'll exchange emails, I'll add you to a list, we'll try and figure this shit out. Either Capreit gives us free rent for the next 6 months or we're all fucking leaving because this is absolutely STUPID. Just WATCH my video above. Who can live in those conditions? I pay $1140/mo for 400sqft for fucks sake. I haven't even fully unpacked because I have nowhere to put my shit. Now I have to put up with this? No way. No way. We need to organize.


EDIT4 UPDATE: Well

I have to say, Annika, Shauna, camera-guys I didn't get your name I'm sorry, everyone everywhere who helped to solve this problem. Karen Stintz got involved, this has just been amazing. I never expected such a response. Thank you all so much.

I have never seen so many in one city before. Also kind of amazed that no one gets stuck or has any accidents in them.

2. You guys seem very passionate about the direction of your city. I heard a lot of talk about the city government and transit (downtown relief line!!!) and taxes...rather nice to see that level of civic concern. Don't have that much here in my part of Australia. 

3. People hold the door for you wayyyyy in advance. Not that this is a bad thing per se. I just found myself having to speed speed walk almost five metres to the door sometimes ;)

4. There seems to be much anxiety about real estate. I get the sense Toronto became ""hot"" very quickly and people are somewhat unprepared?

5. You guys are friendly drivers :)

6. Roads were awful though.

7. So many Indians 

8. So many helpful blogs and weeklys like blogto and torontoist! So helpful to me as a visitor for finding things to do. Other cities didn't have this as much.

9. Seems to be a lot more hate toward the suburbs than anywhere I've been (like calling them 905 ers as if they were some unwanted species of pest). What explains this? I mean people in cities generally joke about suburbanites but this seems quite targeted and mean spirited? Odd since you guys are so great otherwise!

10. So many people called me ""hun."" even guys! I loved it. 

Anyway toronto is my favourite big city in Canada and I hope to come back soon! You guys have a ver cool city! ESP Kensington market and cabbage town 

Have a nice day

--a friendly semi drunk Aussie

Band's playing a show tonight at Horseshoe Tavern and we really need an audience. We don't have a strong following unfortunately and yet we've been asked to bring 40 people. Pretty sure not even 10 are coming. Most of our friends have to worry about school tomorrow morning and family's not much of an option for us.

We're on at 11 and there's no cover on Mondays for Horseshoe so you won't even lose a dime if you come. 

We're four young guys who absolutely love being on stage but we're getting really tired of performing to no one. 

Here's some of our music: http://hottea.bandcamp.com/album/good-things

It'd mean a lot if you could come

Thanks for reading

Edit: Response for this has been incredible. I just threw this ad up here as a last ditch attempt but honestly thanks for the support

As far as how the show went, putting it behind us and moving on to the next one.

They will replace it with another of the same model if it's defective in some way but they won't let you return it, you're screwed. 

Most places do this with software and media in order to prevent you from just copying it and returning it, a gaming headset or a controller or something at Best Buy or Future Shop or Wal-Mart and it's in good condition you can return it for a cash refund even if you've opened the package. At EB, they will only replace it with an identical item. So if possible buy any hardware product you're considering buying there from a place with a better returns policy instead.

This happened to me and it took several trips to the store + 2 hours arguing with customer service on the phone just to get it replaced with a different brand/model of the same type of item. I'm not making this thread to vent or something though,False,self,t5_2qi63,False,,,t3_1508i0

Someone says to me ""Oh switch to Rogers

RANT:

That's not an option. Rogers is an underhanded company that's robbing Canadians blind. I won't support them

Rogers owns the underlying infrastructure that is to blame for the outage and it is their lack of service that is causing it to continue. The issue affecting the network isn't physical and shouldn't haven taken more then a few days to fix

Teksavvy customers shouldn't be angry with Teksavvy

Going without internet for awhile is less important than supporting one of the few companies in Toronto that is attempting to introduce new alternate infrastructure. If Teksavvy is able to fight it's way through the bullshit and build a new Toronto wide internet network

Canada has dreadfully slow service compared to the rest of the world

Furthermore - the same can be said for Rogers and Bell as cellphone providers. Cell phone service in the rest of the world is far cheaper then here. The only reason the cost is this inflated is because there was never any outside competition. Now that there is,False,self,t5_2qi63,False,,,t3_o1878

1341795174.0,w8upw,UPDATE: Help find the criminals who put my cousin in a coma - SUSPECT HAS BEEN ARRESTED,justicefordan,219,34,32,"Yesterday I posted [a reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/w5zdx/help_find_the_criminals_who_put_my_cousin_in_a/) seeking help finding the people who assaulted my cousin.

Today I relieved to let you all know that the police have arrested the suspect in the case and have charged him with aggravated assault.  Thank you everyone who shared the information about Dan's assault, now a day and a half later the site has had over 20,000 visitors and a suspect is in jail, all of which has just totally astounded us. 

For confidentiality reasons the police have not disclosed the details of the arrest or investigation so I don't know what part, the important thing is that they've got the guy they were looking for. 

Right now we are focusing on helping Dan get better and ensuring that the Crown Attorney uses all the resources available to secure a conviction and appropriate sentence for the accused. 

I've spent most of the day between the court house and the hospital so I'm a bit exhausted but I've posted a more lengthy update with more information at:

[http://www.justicefordan.ca](http://www.justicefordan.ca)

I'll be updating the site with progress on the case and Dan's condition as things change.

Again thank you so much to everyone who showed concern and compassion for Dan and acted to help bring his assailant to justice.

****
On Thursday June 28 at 2:30 AM my cousin Dan was walking along Dundas West Street (Just west of Dovercourt) in Toronto.  He was seen in a verbal dispute with a man and a woman.  The man struck my cousin in the back of the head with a weapon, and condition is extremely serious.  He may not live (He has suffered several strokes and other setbacks while in the ICU) and if he does he will almost certainly have permanent brain damage.  

A bit about my cousin: He's a 22 year old guy, never been in a fight in his life, laid back, likes to play videogames, watch ted videos, typical stuff.   Blood tests showed that he was not drunk when the assault happened. 

The suspects: 
You can view surveillance camera pictures of the suspects here:

[http://www.torontopolice.on.ca/newsreleases/pdfs/23951.pdf](http://www.torontopolice.on.ca/newsreleases/pdfs/23951.pdf)

One is a white male, medium build with a shaved
head. He was last seen wearing a Portugal soccer jersey.
The other is a woman described as having a dark complexion, black, curly hair.

They both appear to be smoking.

We've created a website at [http://www.justicefordan.ca](http://www.justicefordan.ca) with more details. 

Earlier in the day there had been a soccer game between Spain and Portugal.  The male suspect is wearing a Portugal jersey with what looks like a number 7 on the front which is Renaldo's number.   

Please take a look and share these pictures with anyone who you know who might have been in the area.  This was a savage and unprovoked attack that's left a good guy fighting for his life.

There is a line of cyclists in the bike lane, and then someone (for some reason almost always a lady, sorry ladies) on a big clunky bike coasts to the front of the line and stops, effectively cutting everyone else off.

Now, maybe they're turning right. But no, they never are.

Then, and everyone has to cut out into traffic to pass them.

We hit the next light and the same cyclist does the same thing again! It's like someone cutting you off on the highway and then suddenly slowing way down

1357232267.0,15w8iu,TTC complaint filed today for unbelievable behavior by a bus driver. (Slightly long read),ReeG,258,88,590,"This was just posted to my FB by a former work colleague. I couldn't believe what I was reading. I figure this was worth sharing with /r/Toronto. Anyone else have similar experiences like this?

""I just made my first official complaint to the TTC. I can't believe it took me this long to formally complain about a TTC worker because I've thought about doing it many

This morning I was waiting for the Finch Express bus (#199) at the corner of McCowan and Finch at 6:40am with my baby in his stroller. The bus pulled up and I wheeled my stroller to the front doors and kindly asked the driver if he could lower the platform that would enable me to get my stroller out of the snow and cold and onto the bus. There were about five other people waiting behind me at the stop but none of them offered to help and I also didn‚Äôt ask any of them for help because they all happened to be elderly ladies. The bus driver lowered the platform and raised myself and my stoller onto the bus. I thanked him and showed him my metropass and was about to go take my seat when he said to me

Obviously, ‚ÄúYou need to get a smaller stroller so that you can lift it onto the bus by yourself.‚Äù I told him that he wasn‚Äôt in a position to tell me what I need or what my baby needs and that if it takes too much time to lower the platform that he should just help me up onto the bus himself. I continued walking toward the back of the bus and he yelled at me (since I was about halfway down the bus at this point), ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs his dad? He should be helping you. If he even has a father.‚Äù

There were

I was the last person to get off the bus and was lucky enough to have someone help me down with the stroller this time. I asked the driver for his name and he refused to give it to me. I told him I would file a complaint against him and he said

This is the second occasion that I have been given a hard time about asking a bus driver to lower the accessibility platform. The first time was in August when a TTC bus driver told me that ‚Äúlowering the platform holds up the entire bus and people have places they need to be. ‚Äú I was upset about this at the time but never thought to report it. I figured that particular driver was just having a bad day. But the thing I don‚Äôt understand is that it takes about a minute to lower the platform and then raise it back up again. And I understand that people have places they need to be but SO DO I. I resent the inference that women with strollers should just stay at home unless their husbands are present to help them on and off buses. This morning I was on my way to work and I have to drop my son off halfway at his daycare. This is a long trip on the TTC for both of us and it certainly is not made any more pleasant when the first thing we encounter in the morning is a bus driver who has no decency and can‚Äôt manage to filter the things he says to the public.

I know that the TTC has a zero tolerance policy for assault against TTC workers ‚Äì I see posters for it everywhere. But why should any of them be allowed to say whatever they want to the people who pay to use this service?

Also

9 AM - I am pulling into my work parking lot as a silver/grey minivan pulls into the lane I'm driving in.. he sees me and cancels his plans to turn in and I pull up in front of him and brake because I have to turn into my work parking lot in less than 100 meters. He thinks I brake checked him and pulls up beside and says ""PULL OVER"".. I ask him where he learned to drive and he says again ""PULL OVER ASSHOLE"" and shows me some badge.

I pull into my work lot and have two middle aged men on either side of my car yelling at me telling me that they are police officers and I'm about to get fucked. Reckless driving, and ""inciting roadrage"". They take my information and tell me that I'll never be able to have my license, or see my car ever again - nor will I ever be able to cross the border.

Keep in mind they did not identify themselves, continuously swore at me PROFUSELY the entire time.

In the end - he gave me back my license and told me that he hasn't decided whether or not he is going to charge me and it could take a year or two.. made me apologize to him and his partner and left me.

I can't do anything IF he was a cop because it's two cops against me (I'm brown skinned and drive a nice car btw)... and collectively they will have my ass, insurance etc. I don't have the info to file a complaint because they didn't provide any -- I didn't want to risk asking them for it because I read that it makes them angrier if you come across insubordinate - I just let them have their power trip.

What a shitty start to a Tuesday.

EDIT: Due to the nature of the altercation and the way in which I was hustled - I did not ask for any ID


**UPDATE:**

I went to the 33 Division and asked to speak to some of the constables there. The two guys were indeed police officers from the ""intelligence"" unit located next door - and they confirmed that the badge I saw was real and that they do in fact drive those exact same cars.

I was told I could file a complaint for an investigation - but was subtly warned against it because it would ""be putting a lot on me"". AKA - they'll just all fuck me more. I was told that most of the stuff they were saying WAS indeed bullshit and that they were just trying to scare the shit out of me and teach me a lesson. They also apologized for the way I was treated but reinforced that if it came down to it - it's their words against mine.

SO case closed - for all of you people telling me I got scammed and have my identity stolen cus there is NO way a ""cop"" would do this. Be VERY cautious because they just in fact did and got away with it. They could have fucked me much worse and charged me with a lot of shit

I'm lucky I kept my mouth shut and acted like a pussy otherwise I'm pretty positive I would have got my ass kicked and thrown in jail - ""omg cops cant do that"" - they fucking can and will after the shit I've seen. Don't think for one fucking second any of you have any rights unless you're sure there are 50 people testifying for you. Be careful.

***TL;DR***: **IP-based evidence implicate volunteers of a *Conservative candidate's* campaign as perpetrating the offence against ~7000 *Non-Conservative* Guelph residents.**

***

&gt; ""The ITO explains that Mathews‚Äô **investigation traced the source of the Guelph calls to a pre-paid mobile phone used to engage the services of RackNine, 2011. Instructions to transmit a similar message purporting to come from the Liberal party candidate, between 2 a.m. and 4:45 a.m. on election day, to the same numbers, were deleted before they could be acted upon.""

&gt; ""RackNine is a voice broadcasting vendor providing digital Voice over Internet Protocol (VOIP) calling technology. **During the election campaign in 2011

&gt; ""The individual originating the misleading calls used a false name and address in communicating with RackNine and used anonymous proxy servers based in Saskatchewan and the United States to pay for the service through the online payment service PayPal. The pre-paid mobile phone was registered with a false name and address and the subscriber paid for the RackNine service through Paypal using non-reloadable Visa and Mastercard pre-paid cards bought anonymously at drug stores in Guelph. There was no suggestion made before me that RackNine was aware that its automated call services were being used for an improper purpose. Once the account was established, were communicated to the RackNine servers via the Internet. ""

&gt; ""Mr Mathews ascertained that **the Internet Protocol (IP) or computer address used by the originator of the misleading messages was associated with a second IP address** in RackNine records used for voice broadcast orders **from the Deputy Campaign Manager for the Conservative candidate in Guelph.** CPC records indicate that the same IP address was used to access the CPC Constituency Information Management System (‚ÄúCIMS‚Äù) database by 5 volunteers supporting the Conservative candidate in Guelph. Access to CIMS was limited to those who had been approved to have access by the CPC and who had been issued unique passwords. According to a witness interviewed by Mr. Mathews

Edit: Bolding salaciousness

***

&gt; The ITO states that CIMS records indicate that a volunteer with the Guelph campaign accessed the database on April 30
non-Conservative supporters that was updated in CIMS on April 27

*UPDATE* I have Contacted the CFIA and the local media....thank you for all the support! 

I am a butcher at a higher end butcher shop

the re-seller (who buys from XL directly gave him a refund for the meat and instructed him to dispose of it, and we are STILL using the trimmings from said meat to be made into our ground beef, 

I took no part in it and verbally objected to it...

when meat comes in we take it out of boxes and on to our shelves in our cooler. Once that happens we have NO idea what meat came from where and when

I took some pictures that I have and am holding for safe keeping

I hate that our staff is telling our customers that we only deal locally and do not deal with XL Foods when  in fact the Customer is buying ground beef made from the recalled product.

another thing is The Boss is a very very wealthy man and had no need to do this

I know, gay adoption, gay marriage...hell, I‚Äôm the least homophobic a guy can be without performing fellatio ‚Äì but nonetheless, the Pride parade still leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

For decades, not some breed apart that doesn‚Äôt breed, but people just like the rest of us who happen to have a different sexual orientation.

And then we have the Gay Pride parade, we see tarted-up drag queens, X and bikers with butt plugs. And quite frankly, that isn‚Äôt reflective of the gay people I know. Instead of building bridges, the parade is a freak show on wheels that re-inforces unhelpful stereotypes and serves the propaganda purposes of the haters. It is, quite frankly, an affront.

That‚Äôs because the parade isn‚Äôt about pride in one‚Äôs sexual orientation, maybe that‚Äôs one way of showing commonality with the hetero world, because none of the kinks being showcased aren‚Äôt unique to the gay community. Leather, bondage, sex toys, cross-dressing and the other fetishes you‚Äôll see in force are sexual behaviours that straight people participate in...so where is the gay? Just because gay people do something doesn‚Äôt make it a gay activity. The parade gets pride in sexual preference confused with pride in sexual activity.

Sure, the gays‚Äô parade is a window into their world...and the window, like the floats, has a lot of cracks showing.

Because hairy guys with their asses hanging out of leather chaps riding penis-shaped floats is not going to help the poor guy closeted at his law firm feel more comfortable in coming out

And further, but quite the opposite.

All in all, the entire gay rights issue is one of human rights. You don‚Äôt get that message watching stocky topless lesbians on tricycles.

The gay community‚Äôs slogan for years has been, get used to it‚Äù Well, we know, we know and we have...now please grow up and show your cause its rightful dignity.",,False,self,False,t3_1fjwcs

A place where within a 1 km radius

A place where dim sum is done better than its place of origin.

A place where people can meet each other from different places in the world

Anthony Smith killed and Muhammad Khattak shot outside Loki Lounge.  According to Det. Joyce Schertezer Smith was the intended target of a ""very bold"" shooting.  Both Smith and Khattak's family both report that neither of them were in trouble and it made no sense why they were shot.  
  
A post on Loki Lounge‚Äôs Facebook page on March 29 from ‚ÄúLoki Management‚Äù said ‚Äúcontrary to media reports‚Äù there were ‚Äúno altercations or incidents inside Loki prior to the shooting‚Äù and the bar was closed to patrons at the time of the shooting.

**May 16** -   
  
Gawker makes first report on the Rob Ford video.  The owners of the video want money in exchange for the video.  In order to raise funds
  
Quote from the article: ""But when I emailed an acquaintance at CNN this afternoon, in turn, asked CNN's Canada reporter about it. The Canada reporter‚Äîand this was a pretty fucking big mistake‚Äîcalled a source who used to work in Ford's office. Within 40 minutes, word had gotten back to me that 'CNN called Ford's office asking about a crack tape.'""  
  
The Star reports on viewing the same Rob Ford video
  
The Somali drug dealers who have the video ask the Star for money saying they wanted to move to Calgary.

**May 17** -  
  
Sources tell the Star that Rob Ford told senior aides not to worry about the video because he knew where it was, press secretary George Christopoulos and others. Missing from the meeting was Mark Towhey, then Ford‚Äôs chief of staff.  
  
Later in the day, if someone had told him where the video was, what would we do?‚Äù, and Towhey told him to contact the police.  
  
Price also told Towhey the video may have been the reason that Anthony Smith was killed.  
  
Gawker begins raising money to buy the video via their ""Crackstarter"".

I am 26 years old and a mother of a 2 year old. My husband and I fell in love with the apartment we rent in a house near the end of the street

This morning was, when I stepped onto a used drug needle right near the playground my son plays at each and every day. I went on to spend the majority of the day in the ER, being given the option of a 3 month cycle of treatments ""which have symptoms close in similarity to chemotherapy"", or to decide to watch and wait, all while knowing that upon waiting, any illnesses that arise (HIV, HEP B

I stepped on that needle, but I have heard a disturbing number of similar reports from neighbours. So how were all of the other needles that have been reported in the last few weeks found? Were other parents stepping on those? Was it all adults who discovered the dozens of needles that have been strewn across our 'Eden by the lake'? How many of those individuals will go on to discover that they have aids as a result of the multiple prostitutes/crack addicts in our community who have been diagnosed?

I am very much aware that this community was, and during this time (from what I have heard) the drug abuse diminished to a whisper of hidden use. Unfortunately, with the reduction in patrolling officers in this area, has come the explosion of drug use and open prostitution, side by side with the dozens of 2-10 year olds playing in the street and park all through the afternoon and evening.

I am begging you.
Do not let one more innocent person - child or adult - become affected by this nonsense. Do no let one more parent
There is an entire community desperate for help

I would be happy to help in any way - if you need petitions, please contact me and I would be thrilled to bring together MANY people who would give anything to bring this community back to where it was when it felt safe.

Thank you for your time. ",self,t5_2qi63,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/1jun4i/ive_been_finding_used_needles_in_my_neighborhood/
