For some reason


(I was chosen

The main goal of the website redesign is to make it as easy as possible for people to find the services they need (if you've spent 5 minutes on the current centrelink website

Anyway, because this is something I care about and I thought it would be a good opportunity to make a difference.

So

What are the main features that this new website should have?

What are some websites that already have these features?

What should the website avoid at all costs?

And is there anything else you think I should know?

Please respond to this by Thursday evening if you can

Slurping away on my Coke

I read on further; 'Free Game Download'.

Oh my God... a FREE game download? I LOVE games. This is seriously the best day ever

Off to the McDonalds website I hurriedly go, but for a free game (considering I LOVE games), it was totally going to be worth it.

Finally I get to the point where I input my unique code

""Congratulations you're a winner of a Free Game Download.

Your prize is a Free Pickle Mania Game download that entitles you to download the Pickle Mania game at www.picklemania.com.au. ""

Picklemania I thought... have not heard of that. Is it like trackmania? Is it part of the Call of Duty series? I wasn't sure

Once I got to the website

It was at this point, I did start to feel a little let down inside. I had genuinely hoped to be able to shoot the Hamburgler in my spare time from a PC of my choosing, whether connected to the internet or not, but alas, the game was actually a web based game that anyone could play for free.

What had I actually won? 1000 in-game 'coins'. These allowed me to purchase a new kind of weapon. Perhaps this would assist me to defeat the Hamburgler and save the day. But alas, defeated inside, defeated in my heart... because the game would never really be 'mine'.

That is my story.

Just to update the AMA request for Dr Karl.

I've had a chat to his ""people"" and everybody is keen to do it but he has to get some other stuff out of the way first not least of which is to finish his current book.

So we're looking at least a month before we can hammer out a date but when it gets figured out it should be booked into the official AMA schedule so that everybody knows when it is. In the meantime I'll keep people up to date as new updates come in.

Not only would those laws threaten freedom of speech but damn it's a slippery slope once you start legislating what people can and cannot say.


Not to mention you can already sue the pants off these people if you really want to anyway.

1306203690.0,hijrg,Want to move to Australia? Great!,ThunderCuntAU,539,95,331,"I've seen a great number of posts here about outsiders coming to Australia, let me know!

**A great resource

If you're looking to move to Australia permanently, you should be applying for a [Student Visa](http://www.immi.gov.au/students/students/chooser/). Complete your course, find an employee looking for fresh graduates and *hope that they sponsor you as a working migrant*. If you graduated overseas and have little industry experience, you - in all likelihood - will not find a company to simply pay for and sponsor you trip to Australia. It's an expensive investment and one that may not work out for their business, so why would they? Get yourself a [working holiday visa](http://www.immi.gov.au/visitors/working-holiday/index.htm), find a job *once you're here* and, at some point before the expiry of your visa

If you've got many years of industry experience under your belt, find work, and see if they're willing to sponsor you.

Outside of the above, as well, but I'm happy to be told otherwise.

** What is the job market like in Australia?? **

Better than most Western countries, feel free to ask and I'm sure there's someone here loosely related to your field that can point you in the right direction.

** What is the cost of living like in Australia?? **

Most of us will tell you it's fucking high

Anecdotally, and the disparity of wealth isn't as significant in contrast to, say, the States.

With regards to the cost of living, among the most livable cities in the world. We will complain about Australia, our shitty public transport and our moronic government, but by and large, it's a pretty damn good place to live.

** I'm a x/y/z

Couldn't tell you. Perhaps someone will reply with some generalized advice for the cities

** I want to come to Australia to get a mining job. What do I need to do? **

Good luck with that. Let us know when you work it out. General consensus in these threads is it's not what you know

** What are the police like?? **

Well, cooperate (e.g. if they ask for your name, just tell them) and you'll be on your merry way. I've gotten out of plenty of misadventures by just playing dumb and treating the officer as if they're a human. 

** What about tipping?? **

Employees are paid a reasonable wage. Tips aren't used to compensate an employer that is not paying their employees a reasonable wage. You *can* tip in the service industry

** I like beaches. I want to live in a coastal city. **

Australia is about 3/4 desert. All of our major cities are built on the coast

** How do I make friends? Are you all douches? **

We're fairly happy go lucky people. Don't take yourself or your cause too seriously or we'll be awfully skeptical of you. Your mate is a cunt. Your enemy is just a bit of a shit bloke.

** Will everything in Australia kill me? **

You'll be right. If you're worried about it: shake out your shoes before you put them on and don't stick your hand in any dark holes. Both are prime spider real estate. It's worse in rural areas.

** What about religion in Australia? **

[Take a look at the top graph](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Australia). Religiosity is on the decline in Australia. Even within the graph, god knows everyone else does.

**Where do you shop??**

Supermarkets are, which I've heard is massive and pretty cool. Aldi is around that is a cheap alternative. 

We (Redditors) seem to like shopping online given how often shopping threads come up. See the r/Aus sidebar for a few more hints. Importing games is nearly always cheaper than going instore to buy them. 

** What about food?? Anything I should know? **

I've noticed [istara](http://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/feplf/thinking_of_moving_to_australia_from_the_us_any/c1fd1uk) write a few posts on this. Go give her some karma. We have less HFCS because we don't have the absurd corn subsidies that are in place in the States. We do

On this note: I've always been impartial to Cadbury chocolate. I'm sure this makes me a derelict hobo in the eyes of a few Aussie Redditors

** Anything I should know about Australian politics??**

It's all about ""hard working families"" in Australia. Two major parties: the Liberals (tip: the name is a misnomer) and Labor. The Wiki or the party's websites would probably do them more justice than I could in a soundbite.

We have mandatory voting. It is a preferential voting system and *not* first past the post.

**What about censorship??**

There is no internet censorship. I repeat: none. This has dropped off the government's agenda for the time being because it's grossly unpopular. Hopefully we remain vigilante and they just drop it entirely.

Some games are censored. It is illegal to sell these games in retail stores. Import them from the UK/US/Asia (personally

Are small tits banned? This is a misconception thrown around by the internet hype machine. A woman's overall appearance is assessed when making judgment about whether she's underage -- this includes breasts. It is one facet of the assessment. Please don't help perpetuate this myth!

** Is everything really upside down?**

Maybe I'm just a bit of a stick in the mud, it does grow a little tiring. You're the customer in the service industry that says ""Savings?! More like spendings!""

I bought Simcity just prior to release, chasing up some more information. 3 days after that, I got a full refund from EA (and got to keep the free game they handed out to placate people).


Keep this in mind if a company ever tries to deny you warranty. Smartphones are a big one for this, when the backlight on the screen broke and Telstra folded pretty efficiently.

With defeat looking very likely for the ALP in September

Average Joe in the street will (and do) tell you that this is the worst government to have ever been in power in the country.  Why do they say this?  Looking at the Rudd/Gillard achievements and comparing them globally they have an outstanding record.  An economy that is the envy of the world, low unemployment, constantly rated (along with the Scandinavian countries) as one of, if not the, best countries in the world.  

Yet, the ALP is headed for oblivion by an opposition government that have almost no policies, seem to be doing it's best to NOT get elected, and have one of the most unlike-able leaders in recent memory.  Why?  

It's the same with the NBN.  I bet if you asked the average person in a suburban street about the NBN the majority would only know it as a $50 billion white elephant.  That's all I ever hear or see on TV or in the main stream media.  Sure, rural people, decentralization of work, telecommuting, future proofing etc.?  

It seems to me that Labor have absolutely no idea how to promote themselves and their policies.  Rather than going on the attack and telling the Australian public about how well we are doing, generally from shitty spun arguments from the opposition.  

So that leads me to ask, public perception and - yes - spin, has to be one of the most important aspects of government these days?

1318476839.0,laeqi,Reminder: it's baby bird season.,,454,82,184,"~~oh god so many fucking birds I mean uh~~ As baby bird season ramps up

* It's a myth that parent birds will reject their young if they smell of human. If you find a baby bird that's not yet properly feathered, check to see if the parents are still around- if they are, put the baby near them on a branch, and they'll keep taking care of it. 

* The young of some species of bird need to spend time on the ground when they're learning to fly. If you see a young magpie, it's perfectly fine and you should leave it alone.

* Don't feed birds bread or mince. Parents will feed it in turn to their young

* If you have a bird that's been injured by a cat or dog, and birds will succumb to infection really quickly.

* If you have a bird that needs to go to a rescuer, dark, and quiet. Birds have body temperatures of over 40 degrees and freak the fuck out very easily; being cold or stressed will kill them pretty quickly. Even ducklings. Especially ducklings.

* If you've got a bit of spare time and like animals, blankets, cloths, or that sort of thing would probably be appreciated.

* [AUSTRALIAN MAGPIE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Magpie)
(aka Piping Shrike

The Aussie Magpie is a large sedentary passerine, much like the mafia, and spend all of their time waddling around on your front lawn and making ridiculous noises, hopefully completely unlike the mafia. Once a year the males kamikaze-attack small children and posties, easily making them the most hilarious bird in Australia to everyone who is not a small child or a postie. 

* [MAGPIE-LARK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magpie-lark)
(aka Mudlark

The Magpie-Lark is distinguishable from the Magpie by dint of being crap. They are always found in pairs, which, while horrific, certainly is a solution to the housing crisis.

Dave and Jacinta, primarily because they do not understand the concept in the first place. 

""I mean,"" says Dave, 29, who works as an unlicensed tradesman in the Western Suburbs, and agreed to speak to us if we bought his round.

Dave is not alone in his doubts. Less than 4 in 10 of the blokes we asked around the bar said that they trusted the current government to deliver on whatever it is they were asked about.

Jacinta is more concerned about welfare for her young family. 

""I'm really worried they might cut the baby bonus

Jacinta is 7 months pregnant with her third child, and her daughter Fruity-Lexia, 14 months, are placing a deal of pressure on the household budget.

Jacinta plans to invest the payment for the next child into necessary upgrades for transportation.

[2.Australian Govt censors secret anti-piracy meeting notes](http://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/ok30y/australian_govt_censors_secret_antipiracy_meeting/)

We can assume that this story has not reached mainstream due to the supposed level of secrecy afforded with government assistance. 

Now, and in light of [the latest wikileaks cable regarding iiNet and MPA and the US Embassy](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/or3wj/australia_wikileaks_cables_revealed_us_embassy/), SOPA, and our own internet type filtery bill in parliament, why has this not received more attention?

Prima Face

I am no expert on this and am no way informed so ITT can we get more information and opinion on this, tell me why.

Thanks

My (tiny) apartment is on fibre running at the same speed as what the NBN will ultimately end up as.

Here are 10 reasons why I'll be voting for the labor party

~~

1. Fibre is future proofed to the best of our current technologies and the years of viability we get from it cause the overall costs to be quite tangible for such a large scale development.  Yes

2. Wifi is not feasible for a country as large as Australia with such a low population density.  A country like Japan are looking into wifi technologies which can viably compete with a ground network

3.  A copper upgrade proposed by the liberals will provide barely any discernable benefit to current connections and is thus (in the grander scheme of things) entirely wasted money within 5 years.  Australia needs a new ground network

4.  Fiber has the ability to be utilized better since it transmits light.  In Japan they're already researching a way to make light travel in a 'tornado' which increases bandwith tenfold on the same line.  This kind of thing means in the future the network will still be viable only by changing the nodes.  This can't happen with copper and in a few years we'll be at the same point as we are now.

5.  It's not about downloading game of thrones faster even though it may at first be the only thing you can think of how you'd benefit from such speeds.  It actually changes how you use the internet completely.  Subconciously you avoid clicking links if it will take more than 4 seconds to load a page.  You don't click on videos

6.  Freedom to upload

7.  The NBN is a single policy that, more than ever it's important to vote for policies rather than the idiots running the show.

8.  I am just a casual internet user.  I don't download things

9.  Being able to get information like television on demand is also the next frontier of media.  Right now with fiber you can be watching an episode of game of thrones, and more and more devices are able to work in harmony with it.

10. I know this is politics, and casual usage of the internet, with at first glance, no direct 'need' for speeds as fast as the NBN, it has completely changed how I use the internet.  And this is only the beginning.  I can see first hand.  Australia really does need this.",,False,t5_2qh8e,True

A couple of minutes later, totally indistinguishable from the real tradingpost website - even the 'Free to browse' down the bottom. 

The page he had open was asking him for his Tradingpost username, and credit card number.

Luckily

That was it. That was the only thing that triggered a 'something's wrong here' thought. It was immaculately done. (it was actually using iframes to grab the real tradingpost site

Anyway, it turns out they had registered the .com.au domain name with NetRegistry. 

That was their first mistake. Registering a .com.au domain needs a fair bit of 'stuff' behind it. A real person, I guess) had actually shut down in 2007.  Bingo!

I got in touch with Netregistry via their abuse@ email address

This is the response I got from them:

&gt; I'll also request our Developer team to review the auto-approvals of registrations for ABNs which are matched at ABR. What appears to be happening is that we're not checking the validity of the ABN

&gt; Once the secondary check is in place

&gt; Thank you for highlighting this issue to me by your research on this domain.

OMG. A company that actually cares

They're now going to revoke the registration (auDA policies win

So

Anyway, here's couple of tips:  

Firstly, and I probably wouldn't have been called in at all. People *know* to look for a certificate when they're typing in credit card numbers. Not using one is a big red flag. 

Secondly, and was coming back with a error. I'm guessing they don't allow deep linking of their searchbar. You would have been better to host it yourself.

I'd heard of the concept before. I never paid it much attention to be honest due to a absence of interest in most things political. If I had to disclose my personal political persuasion, most political parties have been the recipient of my vote at some point in time whether that be state, local or federal politics. I'm a firm believer in ascribing to the politics of being a real human. Some things I have a liberal attitude, others a conservative. I like to think I can weigh a subject on it's own merits. Sure I can be passionate about things I believe in, but politically speaking, I'll approach an issue with logic rather than dogma.

This brings me to my run in with two accounts on reddit.

The first is this individual /u/JS125.  My first encounter with this charming fellow,

""You'll see in September - just be patient... Like ALL Labor shills - you demand to know RIGHT NOW!""

Kind of weird statement coming from a punter.  The ""you'll see"" alludes to some insider information; as if he was privy to something that the rest of us aren't.  So I called him on it and I'll be the first to admit

This ultimately lead to [this exchange](http://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/1a0q73/abbott_denies_faith_will_dictate_politics_still/c8tackv?context=3)

When asking for relevance when he asked who I voted for in the last election I was told...

""It goes to your obvious bias....and ultimate lack of character.""

Who goes out of their way to ascribe a lack of character to someone with different political views? Wierd.

Over the following few weeks

Coincidence?  

Immediately apparent was the presence of a unique formatting style of these two accounts. The inclination towards the liberal use of hyphens in his posts was curious. My suspicions were perked enough after being accused again of being a ""labor shill"". 

So with a spare 10 minutes

Both had worked for IBM in the late 70s.  Both professed to be telecommunications engineers. Both had the same LNP talking points

So armed with these curious similarities

My post was met with fierce defiance from Damocles2010.  I was wrong. He had no idea who this other account was. It was I who had created JS125 myself just to imitate Damocles2010 and in fact by confronting him with this information

Then something even more curious happened.  Within 30 minutes

Now

I will say however

TLDR: The butler did it.
