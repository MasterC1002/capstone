* Wilfred most likely the id.
* Ryan
* None of this psychological stuff is necessarily true
* Wilfred doesn't (always) exist.  In this episode, when the other dog could hear Ryan but not Wilfred.  Wilfred even pointed out he was right there but the dog still couldn't hear him.  This fits with the theme of Ryan being crazy.
* Ryan is obviously troubled.  This is his mind creating sane scenarios when dealing with Ryan's troubled actions.  Of course he sees a conspiracy
* This story was the traditional neighbor getting killed bullshit we've seen in other shows stretching for material.  Now, fueling this somewhat lame series of events.  Still, this is getting pretty heavy handed.  I think this really might be the last season, or wrap up obvious answers, leaving tidbits for the next season.  Sort of like an epilogue.

On the Ryan being crazy front: I can see this as being a misdirection by Wilfred (Ryan's mind, ""transcending"" this reality, communicating with his mind in a very literal way, whereas most people only have an inner, obvious dialogue.

It could go either way at this point.  These are just my observations.

Thanks for reading.

As an addendum, in many ways, animals are coming into more and more dignified rights.  Played so straight but still absurd to somebody that doesn't think about it, and mindblowing when you do.  This humor is very cutting edge.  

EDIT: Notice in Intuition when Wilfred is sleeping.  It's during the scene that Ryan is talking to his sister about help

* Each dream uses set pieces in Ryan's subconscious representation of himself and the forces working within him, emotional attachments to past injuries personified by people in his life, resulting in unstable views of reality.  This leads me to think that there are 3 possible endings to this series

1. Ryan is crazy and this is the result.  It will result in a catharsis for Ryan, barring that, closure on Ryan ever getting better.  His mom would be an example of his fate were he not to confront his issues.  He would retain his sanity by defeating his views on his Dad and family, and especially Wilfred.  Wilfred in this case would represent his ""insanity"", the dark side, whatever term you're comfortable with, and Ryan would defeat this.  Or, learn what to listen to and what to ignore from everybody in his life

Message?  Life is complicated and intense, they are indeed living meaningful lives.  Or some iteration of that.

2. What I said above.  That Wilfred is a representation of mind that works differently.  I mention ""transcended"" before, artistic.  I think we could all agree on Ryan being artistic.  Like his mother.  This is how he projects his shattered mind.  Yes, he's still technically ""crazy"", but not really, since he would be a functioning person with what we would term a mental illness.  I imagine this ending will be seeing Ryan as happy yet at peace, accepting of the feelings in his life, instead of always fighting them.  Go with the flow.  In this one

I admit that this 2nd ending could end with some sort of cackling Elijah Wood sitting in his imaginary basement plotting shit with Wilfred, or create such an ending to demonstrate the dangers of disregarding it.

Message of the 2nd?  Peace is more precious than all things

3. Ryan is dying from the suicide attempt and this is his oxygen starved brain slipping into that next whatever the hell is waiting for us (yes, consciousness, life, whatever.  Essentially, his life is flashing before his eyes, but a sort of imaginary life in which he figures himself out and why exactly he killed himself.

Message the 3rd?  There's no escaping life.

I don't know how to change that numbering up there

I cant recall a single moment when Ryan has explained much about his past. I remember one episode where Ryan is suspected of stealing the neighbors things so he turns up to this party where people ask him about his past and he ends up holding up his tongue in his hand

Episode - 1 Ryan actually kills himself
Then he goes to purgatory and the show starts.
Nobody is real except for Ryan and Wilfred (and a select few.)
Wilfred is there as a guardian angel to guide Ryan.

Ryan's whole life was full of being pushed around, and doing nothing to better himself.

Those were his sins and Wilfred is there to show him how he was living a terrible life and not living life to its full extent. 

Wilfred first has to show Ryan how to stand up for himself and this explains why Wilfred badgered Ryan until he finally took a stand marking Ryan's first real change.

The rest of the time Wilfred is showing the aspects of life that Ryan passed by and what he was missing out on. i.e. friendship

The other guy who talks to Wilfred in the other episode is also dead. Wilfred did the same for him that Wilfred is now doing for Ryan. The man is simply visiting Wilfred to help Wilfred help Ryan

When he visits his mom

Wilfred is purposely a bad influence on Ryan sometimes so that Ryan will learn to stand up to Wilfred and doing wrong as well. This way Wilfred keeps Ryan in balance.

In the final episodes Ryan will either pass on to the next world, he sees her right before he takes the suicide cocktail), but Ryan will inevitably ask her out, and will live a more assertive and honest life.

1.) When Ryan was young he had a troubled life - that's the explanation for why Wilfred is in the painting. Ryan always subliminally knew he was there, running around in his front lawn, etc. He wasn't *his* dog, he was just around, as guardian angels tend to be (according to people who believe in them IRL), so Ryan inserted him into his picture.

2.) Ryan had just tried to commit suicide, which is a lesson - and your guardian angels is supposed to a.) protect you, and b.) teach you things, which Wilfred has done many times.

3.) No one else sees Wilfred as Ryan does, but no one sees them as the person being helped does. They seem them as someone who appears out of no where and starts fixing things, teaching them things, or talking to them in a way someone who was ""normal"" wouldn't, while if they point the person out to someone else they're just seen as a normal person.

1348059686.0,104th6,"Theory: How the tennis ball, the father, the basement, and the mother all relate to and may be direct references to The Shining. ",,6, don't read this because it's a great movie that shouldn't be spoiled. The following contains major spoilers for The Shining and also spoilers for anyone not caught up to the last aired episode of Wilfred (Resentment). 

This is my theory. In The Shining, with frustration over his job (writing.) After a while of this he just throws the ball into the darkness of the hotel. Later, Danny is playing with his trucks on the carpet, and that same tennis ball rolls up to him, serving two purposes: luring him into Room 237, and beckoning him to play. The implication is that the ghost twin girls wanted him to play (""forever and ever and ever"") and join their side. Also, it could be that the hotel itself (which ""shines a little"") rolled the tennis ball to Danny - symbolically the frustration of his father rolling up to meet the child through the means of the hotel. Danny does not pick up the ball. He does however get up and he finds the door to Room 237 already open with a key inside the door, I imagine it would be symbolic that he would in fact be joining the other side with the twins by the end of the film. In the end of the film and in the novel I believe

Anyway, tells Ryan that his father is obsessed with him and wants him back. In the Shining, Jack became obsessed with Danny, because the hotel and its unearthly residents want Danny (who ""shines"") and his abilities to join their side. That tennis ball was technically thrown from his father's anger and landed right beside Danny, and also Ryan. When Wilfred offers the ball to Ryan, he's asking him to play (""forever and ever and ever?"",) and unlike in The Shining, or just be a symbol that Ryan joined the other side (mentally, his son took it on. In Wilfred

Ryan's mother and Danny's mother both faced similar situations. The presence of a possibly abusive, etc. We can't say for sure if he was abusive, but it seemed implied in the final scene of the episode where Ryan trips on Peyote, and implied through Ryan's dread and fear over him. Ryan's mom also sees a companion animal in the form of the cat, as seen in season one. As a side note for the overall show, the cats and dogs at those mental hospitals are normally referred to as ""Therapy Cats"" (or Therapy Dogs) and are used to help patients reconnect with life and their own emotions. 

Now, he goes into Room 237. The tennis ball is a lure into the room, the very room Danny was told never to go into by his friend Dick Hallorann. Once Ryan accepts the tennis ball, he begins to hang out in his non-existent basement. Most fan theories from The Shining imply that Room 237 never existed but only as a way of facing fears (the old hag woman representing things that cause fear and harm.) Was Ryan lured into the basement, too? I'd say so. (Edit: Also the tennis ball rolls up to Ryan's feet from inside the closet/basement in the final episode of season one. I think that's a pretty direct reference.)

Anyway, in a roundabout way the father being the source. In The Shining, Danny doesn't pick it up. In Wilfred, Ryan does. In this show, perhaps, Ryan's not joining the world of the dead, even though he tried to in Episode One. He's just going back into his own mind, and exploring them with the help of his Therapy Dog. Maybe it isn't so dangerous for Ryan to go into the basement, emotion by emotion.  

What's all this mean for the show? Maybe these references to The Shining infer, maybe a type of mischievous pooka. Ryan (and his mother) could be shining. Likewise, it could just be references to the brilliant movie dropped here and there because the show boasts intelligent writers and The Shining is of course a classic.

1373930939.0,1idi20,I think there are clues that point to Ryan's father orchestrating everything,nelsnelson,9,5,11,"**TL;DR**: Wilfred is playing the most important role in an elaborate long-con to stoke the fires of Ryan's congenital proclivity to mental instability

I think that Ryan's father

1. Ryan's father's is wealthy, and is probably the ruthless mastermind of a vast criminal enterprise.
2. Ryan has left his father's firm
3. James, ""Do anything to get him [Ryan] back at the firm.""
4. Jenna is in on it too.  She appears to break down and admits that everything she does is taking advantage of Ryan's obvious crush on her.  Ryan mistakes this admission as her admitting to just leading him on.
5. So far, but then she misquoted what Wilfred said to her.  I think this may have been done deliberately, in order to allow Wilfred to perpetuate his role as Ryan's handler.  Or maybe Amanda really was just crazy.
6. Wilfred slipped up once in trying to convince Ryan that he is indeed crazy, that Wilfred and his twin have always been around, because they are just humans, just 20 years younger.
7. Where did Wilfred and his twin come from?  I don't know.  Perhaps Ryan's father sired them along with some Australian mistress.  Perhaps they are actually clones that were paid for by Ryan's wealthy father.  But that's a little far-fetched.
8. Wilfred gets upset whenever someone who is not involved in the long-con comes into contact with Ryan.  For instance
9. Wilfred says to Ryan after Amanda is apparently arrested (though that's never shown), then Ryan's father will execute or otherwise dispose of Wilfred in some way.  Or, perhaps Wilfred is just an insane clone, brought up from childhood to believe that he actually is a dog, and is convinced that he has no other purpose but to look after Ryan.
10. In the episode Service, I believe that~~ (Thanks, [thekotoz](/u/thekotoz)) this is Catherine's own anthropomorphized pet cat (her Wilfred) who passed away at the beginning of the episode.  This could still go either way.  Perhaps Rhea was the representation of Catherine's actual hallucinations, but this still might not indicate that Ryan is actually crazy and that Wilfred is Ryan's equivalent of her mother's hallucinations.  It could still be that Catherine's anthropomorphized cat hallucination played by Rhea was the inspiration for Ryan's father (who would have learned all about his wife's hallucination) to create Wilfred (through either a brainwashed insane clone, or through some other mechanism of exploitation of the man pretending to be Ryan's anthropomorphic Wilfred).  Or perhaps, even more diabolically and elaborately, was a woman who was similarly hired or exploited in order for Ryan's mother to be convinced that she too was crazy.  This may be unlikely, because if both Ryan and Catherine were not crazy, but she was the inspiration for Ryan's father's plot to convince Ryan that he is crazy in order to protect himself if Ryan ever went to the Feds with the black books.

Ways to prove the theory -- that Wilfred is just an elaborate long-con to convince Ryan that he is insane, that Ryan is crazy.

Ways to disprove this theory involve proving that Ryan is actually insane, but we the audience only ever see anything from Ryan's perspective.  Similarly in Fight Club, the audience is never shown Tyler's true manifestation as the Narrator until the last few scenes when we are shown the Narrator battling with himself to prevent the bombings.

Things that make me not convinced of my own theory include all the crazy shit Ryan's been experiencing.  Of course, without deviation.  Who put up the dry-wall in front of the stairwell to Ryan's basement?

Most confusing of all is Wilfred's ostensible Taoist benevolence, then perhaps he is secretly attempting to subvert Ryan's father's plans by gradually equipping Ryan with the psychological tools required by anyone to convince oneself of one's own sanity, so that Ryan is prepared to go to battle with his father when the time comes.

No matter which episode you watch, it looks ridiculous but keep reading.

When i re-watched second season premiere then hit me. ''Dreams are the way our subconscious communicates with us.'' Exactly! Ryan says his father doesn't have authority to do this. All this Wilfred thing. It's not ethic. And Ryan says his doctor actually Robin Williams. Ryan's subconscious trying to say himself this all just an act maybe?


And here is a another one. In the first episode Wilfred says Ryan's father was right  about Ryan's cowardice . If Wilfred is just a Ryan's imagination

Old people dying, which is why the media wanted to cover it, its a rare story!  
  
Ryan could have possibly been stealing the old peoples meds after swiping the black nurses ID, imagined a backstory for Wilfred.  
 
I think the latter is more probable because after the black nurses confrontation about the missing meds, she too, was severely depressed after having lost her family in Haiti (they add these subtle facts in for some reason...RIGHT?) and was stealing the meds for abuse/suicide, or the confrontation put her over the edge, and she commited suicide out of fear/guilt/depression.

I think in episode 5, i think when we see, it will be end of the relationship. Also in last episode James said ''Your father will do anything to get you back'' Season finale could be on that.

Next episode focusing on Amanda and Ryan. Also featuring Bruce. Which David Zuckerman call that episode. A game changer

They've been telling us that since the first episode. It's not like anyone didn't catch on to that. So there is no need to keep posting the same theory. At this point in the show it seems a little ridiculous for them to go back on these new developments and use such a simple ending. 

We know Wilfred has memories of the past that Ryan wasn't able to experience. So that means Wilfred has been ""alive"" longer than Ryan. 

The drawing might be a curve ball. Kristen may have just had an imaginary friend the resembles Wilfred. But I assume there is more to it then that. 

Either way, I think it's safe to say that Ryan didn't just break down after his suicide attempt.

Wilfred the dog that barks and licks his own balls is very real but Wilfred the human is just how Ryan sees the dog because he suffers from a severe mental illness that is transmitted genetically too. 

The guy clearly suffers from some kind of schizophrenia -and Ryan the shy lawyer is probably not the only personality in his head.


I mean...what else do people expect wilfred to be? an alien? magical creature?


A lot of people will say ""green hippo""

I will say ""Ryan is mentally ill""

For all we know

The guy is crazy scary.

1. This show is not that simple. 
2. THEY ADDRESSED THIS IN S03E01!!

From 99% of the posts I see here people say ""He's either a magical creature or he's in Ryan's head."" The brilliance of S03E01 is that tested both of those hypothesis and both were proved wrong. Period. End of story. He's not just in Ryan's head and he's not just a magical creature. Find another theory because those are wrong. If you need

Wilfred only being in Ryan's head is only in your head.
