 * Demo ends in 1520.

 * I'm in love with this game. I've put 1500+ hours into EU3 and I endorse EU4. Shit is fantastic

 * S key splits troops in half

 * &gt; *That feel when you put 40 hours into a demo*

1376008283.0,1jzszx,Europa Universalis 4: A Guide for those unfamiliar with EU3,BasqueInGlory,218,27,19,"Crusader Kings 2 was successful in a way that most other Paradox franchise games hadn't been. It brought in many new players and breathed new life into Paradox Interactive. It does not however really do much to prepare the players for what comes next. The main Paradox franchise is Europa Universalis, you may find yourself at a loss with Europa Universalis 4.

As such, and are utterly unfamiliar with EU3. If you have played other games in this franchise, this may still be helpful in some ways to introduce key differences between EU3 and 4, but my focus will be largely on how the game relates, or does not relate to Crusader Kings 2.

To begin, one Trade Republic, Venice, the leader of the Holy Roman Empire, Austria, and one fledgling colonial power, Portugal. Each of these will showcase key elements of the game by their inherent focuses; Expansion, Diplomacy

**Part One: Nobody's Business but the Turks**

Begin the game with The Ottoman Empire. The first thing to notice after the game begins is the map. The Ottoman Empire, it is aware of the whole of India and much of the coastline of Indochina and Indonesia. As such, it can engage with diplomatic relations with these powers far before Europeans can.

The second thing to notice is that you are at War. This is not conveyed in a much different way than in Crusader Kings 2, that shows the current war with Moldovia. If you click it, you should see a familiar display showing the status of the war, battles won and lost, and accrued war score.

Presuming you have zoomed into the map close enough, these numbers may seem frightfully small. In EU4, all armies are standing armies akin to retinues in CK2, and similarly, cost money to support. They are composed of subunits called brigades, consisting of 1000 men each. You can hire as many brigades as you want to, provided you can pay for them

To see your support limit, click the military tab represented by the helmet overlaid atop a sword.  This will reveal your country's military status. There is a great deal of information presented here, but right now just focus on one number, the Force Limit. There are two Force Limit numbers, one for Land and one for Navy, they both work in the same way. For the Ottomans, you will have a limit of 60 land brigades, it isn't necessarily important to consistently have your armies filled to the force limit.

 You will see on the Moldovian border, be sure to appoint a leader to the attacking army to minimize your losses. To do this, simply select the army and click the area reading No Leader, and select a general from the list. Different values for their Fire, Shock, Manuver and Siege scores are represented by pips. Having more pips in everything is obviously better. Mouse over them to get tool tips for more details on what each does, but it's not important right now. 

One of the generals will have an Icon that has a crown. This is your nations leader, but this is not often advised. As in CK2, it is very possible for your leader to die on the campaign. On the other hand, this is not nearly as crippling as it can be in CK2. In this age of centralized states, you won't have any disgruntled dukes seeking to usurp your throne or declare independence at the first sign of weakness.

As you move your army into Moldovia, even if it's at 1 percent. As a practical matter, it will often take longer. If the percentage ever reaches 100, it will always reach occupation in the next siege phase.

You may encounter random events and pop ups I do not receive during this waiting period, a flag will drop down reading Call of Peace, informing you that the war has been won, and the people want you to sue for peace, and if you don't you will gain War Exhaustion at an increased rate. War Exhaustion is a percentage score that grows as you send men to their deaths in wars abroad. This is a mechanic of issuing war exhaustion if you don't sue for peace after winning the war is designed to punish certain gamey aspects people could abuse in EU3. War Exhaustion is quite punishing if the score rises too high, sparking mass revolts, which can raise it further when your armies fight the rebels

In order to sue for peace, click the diplomacy button. Here you will see a variety of different diplomatic actions that you can take arranged by type in easy to navigate drop down menus. Sue For Peace, however, is highlighted in red, and right at the top. Click this, click full annexation from the demands menu, and send the demand. They should immediately accept, and immediately

At this point, and you are responsible for protecting them from outside threats. Though they will fight as your allies, their smaller budget makes them individually weaker than they would be independent. 

Finally, little hanging tabs display urgent information in much the same way as they did in CK2. Their urgency is shown by color, green being least urgent.

To the far left there's probably a yellow one notifying you of possible revolts. Others are more simple notifications and reminders, can build buildings, no current mission, etc. To start with, hire some advisers by clicking the notification button. They come in administrative, diplomatic, and military flavors. You can hire one of each. They come in many varieties boosting different specific stats, give a boost to administrative, two, and as such

Your current ruler has a score of 3 across the board, at the end of every month, your final stats from your ruler and your advisers are added to pools of administrative, diplomatic, and military power points, that function as currencies for almost every important action you take, in fact, you'd have seen even demanding the annexation of Moldovia required a number of Diplomatic power points. They are also used to invest in new technologies, and many other things that will come up as you play.

We then switch over to triumphant France, as the new HRE emperor, will soon make her regret attacking the HRE (""It's not over yet""). Austria storms off the party angrily and bumps into Ulm, who then sneaks into the party, sees France in all her beauty and falls in love (""Huge Tracts of Land"").

Next scene, until, out of nowhere, comes France and asks him for an alliance. France tells him that she wants to take some more HRE territories, and needs someone to keep Austria distracted (""So long Vienna"").

Next scene, who inform us of their victory and how Ulm grabbed a couple of provinces from Austria and is now a major HRE player (""Fleur De Lis""/""Alone in the Empire (Reprise)""). High on provinces, Ulm kisses France and the two embrace.

Meanwhile, and Austria suggests allying and taking back their territories from Ulm.

Ulm and France are arguing. France says Ulm is expanding too rapidly, and anyway she only wanted this union because she was looking for strategic allies and she doesn't truly love him. France slaps Ulm and he storms off-stage to war against Tuscany. France bursts into tears but is comforted by Spain, who tells her not to worry, Austria and Prussia will take care of Ulm. Stricken, France laments Ulm's impending doom (""Prestige"").

Switch to Prussia and Austria, summoning all of their old alliances and friends (""Casus Belli"").

We then see Ulm as he realizes his mistakes as rebels swarm his Italian provinces and the Austrians and Prussians are closing in (""Attrition""). France, but must honor her alliance to Prussia (as a result of a brief fling they had when it was still Brandenburg). Their voices merge and we get the centerpiece of the musical, ""Empire Borders"".

We then have a showdown - Prussia, Prussia and Austria try to talk France out of supporting Ulm, but she persists, telling them sometimes love is more important (""Love is Better than Provinces""). The two strike France down, and Ulm realizes how arrogant and power hungry he was and agrees to hand over most of his territory (""Under these Conditions"").

As Austria and Prussia leave the stage, Spain bursts in telling them of a huge revolt in the Austrian Netherlands, and that this is France's chance of reclaiming some of her prestige by breaking the truce and claiming some of her cores from the HRE while they are distracted. France smiles and says to Spain that maybe she should just let this one go, since she has better things to attend to like maybe colonizing Indochina. Ulm and France kiss again (""Empire borders (reprise)""), curtains down, fade to black.

These are the steps you must take to beat the Ottomans

On Day One:

 1. Ally with Serbia (9 times out of 10 will accept)*

 2. Set your rival to the Ottomans*

 3. Convert your king to a general

 4. Build one regiment of infantry in your southernmost province (Morea?) 

 5. NEVER stop building galleys. Take loans if you have to.


On Day Two:

1. Check Albania to see if he is allied with Athens (9 times out of 10 he will be)

2. Declare war on Albania to take your cores. Make sure to bring Serbia into the war (very important).* 

Later: 

 1. Land troops waiting in the Aegean onto Athens. Athens will have moved their army. 

 2. Leave one troop in Athens

 3. Once contact is made in Achaea

 4. Once you win the battle

 5. Wait for Serbia to peace out with Albania

 6. Don't get too hasty

 7. NEVER STOP BUILDING GALLEYS

 8. (Optional) Set sail for Trebizond and annex them. However

 By now you should have 20-30 galleys. Wait for Ottoman troops in Greece to move to Anatolia for whatever reason. Declare war when the Ottomans have no troops in Greece.

THE WAR : 

 1. Do not

 2. Siege the Balkans to your heart's content. 

 3. This war should be fought without a single land battle. Will give you the 'Cold War' acheivement. 

 4. Take as many provinces as you can. It is recommended that you wait for the Ottomans to have very high War Exhaustion before peacing

 5. It might be wise to take back any provinces held by Catholics if you have 40+ galleys. The Knights and Cyprus should be easy pickings. Venice can be taken on if he doesn't have many naval allies.

[[An imgur album of my exploits. Ignore the first image.]](http://imgur.com/a/Gvt1R)



*Here are some reasons behind the beginning statements. If you take a look at your surroundings, because they are too slow. However, Serbia can move their troops into place fast enough to become leader of the siege. We will let Serbia take Albania's money, and then we let our single set of infantry take the land. This allows us to take over two of our cores (which offer decent ship building capabilities) with relative ease. All we need to do to win a war with the Ottomans is to have more ships than they, and to not have their armies in Europe. 

Edit: Athens and Albania merely help you *a lot*. You can theoretically win the war with the Ottomans without them. Try to grab one if you can't grab the other. If you can't grab either, Ragusa or Bosnia.

 * **An EU4 Release Megathread will be created.**

This thread will be similar to the demo megathread. Feel free to talk about anything relating to EU4 and the release in that thread. Try to keep questions in that thread as well

**DISCLAIMER:** *I have been playing this game for months. It was done without the Republic and Sunset Invasion DLCs. It was done without any reloads - I even turned off the autosaves and game would be saved only when I was done for the day. This resulted in about 120 years of gametime lost due to game crushes



Ever since SOI came out I have been eagerly anticipating the pagan DLC


I wasn't planning on becoming the [Tri-Emperor of half the world](http://i.imgur.com/bz7U48V.jpg). My goal for the game was pretty straight forward - to paint the name of my religion across the Europe in [big fat letters](http://i.imgur.com/n9QEIja.jpg).


I started off as a small count of Värmland. I decided to go with a custom ruler, and eventually, through marriage and intrigue, my grandson became the King of Sweden. 

I did this all in one day and did not save the game, but this time as a King. The dwarf genes didn't pass on once again....


As a pagan King I quickly learnt that nobody liked me


After a 120 years of carefully picking my fights I have finally [formed Scandinavia](http://i.imgur.com/jfWgvFb.jpg). Despite being a fierce Viking I was shaking like a little girl at the thought of HRE declaring a holy war on me. I was so scared I even built a bunch of forts in Denmark. Few years later I noticed something interesting - during one of the civil wars the Kaiser [got into jail](http://i.imgur.com/EQMEu9c.jpg) and a bunch of his vassals won their independence. Later on even more became independent


One thing that my almost-fearless Vikings were scared of more than HRE blob was the Mongol invasion. By the late 1230s we [became neighbors](http://i.imgur.com/xFsUW0Z.jpg). I waited for the invasion. Then I waited some more. Nothing happened. I guess the Mongols just didn't have the balls to wage war against the sons of Odin. [30 years later we were best buddies](http://i.imgur.com/OeOG3W0.jpg)


Mongols conquered Germany


At the beginning of 14th century, because the Mongols have finally summoned up their courage and declared a holy war on me. [Here is the Horde at the peak of their strength](http://i.imgur.com/gH7V3Wu.jpg). At this point I thought the game was over for me because their army was at least twice bigger than mine. At a desperate attempt to save my lands I raised my doomstacks right on the border and quickly assaulted some counties. Turns out the Mongols aren't so good at mobilizing their armies and I ended up winning the war. For some reason Khan had only 5 vassals, and [king of Bohemia held most of the lands within the Empire](http://i.imgur.com/i6NQV1F.jpg). 


The Horde has been around for so long they even acquired some de jure territory! It took me [a little over 100 years to destroy them](http://i.imgur.com/6tRyzbg.jpg). After that I had to break a [few truces](http://i.imgur.com/fYHTjsI.jpg) while conquering Byzantium. The game ended a month after I managed to take Jerusalem.


Here are some interesting screenshots:

*    [Only 4 major religions are still alive](http://i.imgur.com/FtrjwJH.jpg). If I had more time Catholics wouldn't exist. Ilkhanate went Orthodox. Notice my RA - one holy war gives 1% and I can't wage any. Meaning 24 defensive holy wars won by my fierce Norsemen.

From the top left clockwise are:

Quarter 1 and 4 is split into a further four quarters. The castle is the part of the standard for the Kingdom of Castille and the crowned lion is the Kingdom of Leon

Quarter 2 and 3 are split in half. The half on the left is the royal standard for the Kingdom of Aragon. It was the half on the right that stumped me for a while. It's origin comes from a rebellion against French rule in the [War of The Sicilian Vespers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_Sicilian_Vespers). 

It reads like a CK2 plot but the basics are that a French duke invaded the Kingdom of Sicily

Eventually the Sicilians revolted against French rule, a French sergeant who pestered a young married woman, dragging her from the crowd. He was stabbed by her husband. The other French tried to avenge his death when the Sicilian crowd fell upon them, killing them all. This all happened whilst people were drinking, in a church. The standard slaughtering of people happened and within six weeks, three thousand French men and women were killed.

The islanders then asked the pope for each city on the island to be recognised as a free commune but the (French) pope refused telling them that Charles was their rightful king and to listen to him etc. etc.. After this the islanders went to their second choice, the sole surviving heir of Frederick II, a Holy Roman Emperor and ex king of Sicily (he was excommunicated four times and Pope Gregor IX called him the Antichrist because he was frequently at war with the papal states). 

Pedro III (King of Aragon) was handily killing Muslims at the time in North Africa when he received the request for help from the Sicilians he was, so, after an appropriate amount of paying attention to the pope's opinion, he ordered his fleet at Sicily and landed.

Charles (the French duke at the start of this what was supposed to be a brief summary) then counter attacked but was repulsed. 

Finally the island of Sicily was taken by Pedro III whilst the mainland territories (called the Kingdom of Naples by modern historians but contemporaneously known as the Kingdom of Sicily) remained with Charles (the French Duke). Also there was a crusade because of this, the King of Majorca revolted against Pedro in the war.

I did adjust literacy levels, I dropped it to at most 30. If an unciv had a literacy level under .01, I brought it up.
So the now uncivilized countries aren't out for the count permanently

Now, we have some unused code that would allow us to modify an existing V2 save instead. This allows converted saves to be more stable and feature-complete from the beginning, but is more complex and masks the features we need to have in place.  

Finally, there's a considerable amount of code we could take from the EU3 to V2 converter and reuse.  

What are your thoughts?  

**Helping Out**  
If you want to help
Modders - let me know the advantages/disadvantages of creating a mod versus a save  
Programmers - weigh in on languages
Everyone -  

* Help start mapping things. I'll have details in a few posts.  
* Do some thread archeology to find the details of the EU4 to V2 Converter (and why we did things how we did)  
* Discuss various conversion mechanics  
* Invite as many programmers as you know to help out

It's the triad of 

1) **desire

2) **promise and**

3) **fulfillment of promise.**

At this moment, etc. But what if you could **promise them a situation that they desire?**

For example, you promised this spymaster a duchy after the plot is executed? This might change his point of view entirely. However you'd then have a traitorous and probably ambitious duke in your realm who has a high Intrigue. (Of course, should his relations with his liege be really high, only huge promises would make him change sides, e.g. a kingdom or an incredible sum of money).

Another example: you want to ask the Pope for an invasion

What if you break a promise? First of all

What it boils down to technically **(skip this list if you don't care about the technicalities):**

1) Characters should have Desires. They currently have ambitions and desire titles (also there are 'Political concerns', money, etc.). The Desires should be weighted based on their relevance and current situation.

2) When proposing a deal or inviting to a plot, 'Character D has been given a sum of N by character E'. The Promise should affect the character's disposition toward the current deal. However, he or she should consider whether the required goal is attainable.

3) After the goal that required the Promise is attained

4) If the situation doesn't occur

5) If the goal isn't attained

I realize that this system may not be easy to implement or mod in

But think of the possibilities! **For example:**

* Playing as William the Conqueror and promising riches and titles to English nobles who turn to your side. 

* Dividing a weak HRE among France

* Getting the crown of Rus by backstabbing your brothers.

* Inviting spymasters to plots by promising them untold riches

* Playing as Iberain muslims

* Playing as a Russian duke under Golden Horde and creating an alliance to overthrow the Mongols. (By promising other strong dukes large parts of territory; also

* On that note: inviting foreigners to your rebellion against your liege by promising them land. How much of your homeland are you willing to sacrifice to get the desired title?

* Also

* Recruit councillors from abroad by promising them positions in the council (thanks to /u/justamathnerd)

* Etc.

Sorry for the wall of text

1360717989.0,18ex7y,EU3 Tips for Beginners,lockeslylcrit,67,3,34,"Here are a few tips and tricks for beginners to utilize. As always

**Economy:**

Your income profit is divided among research, but it can potentially give you inflation. Inflation makes everything more expensive. It's perfectly fine to have a little bit of inflation to fight off a deficit (lawl US economy), but be sure to balance your minting afterwards so that you are lowering your inflation while still making money.

The number by your minting bar is how many ducats you get MONTHLY. These are your taxes. The amount you get at the end of the year are your census taxes. You get 100% census tax in provinces that are your cores

Marketplaces, and you get a portion of that value when you have active traders there. If you have no active traders in that particular Center of Trade, you are actually helping the other nations and hindering yourself by having marketplaces.

If a Center of Trade is in a province you own

Nations receive a penalty to their research cost and stability improvement cost for every province they own. This is why One Province Minors can reach ludicrous levels in research, if you want to expand and still maintain research domination, work on getting more income.

**War:**

The land force limits are based not only on manpower (modified primarily by barrack buildings) but also on tax income, go colonizing and trading to gain income. That way, you can field much more troops than a normal OPM, giving you a clear advantage. Remember that there is no real cap on how many troops you can field, except for the manpower; going over the force limit will simply make military maintenance much more costly.

Before going to war, and so on and so forth until you have almost the entirety of Europe breathing down your neck.

When you declare a war against someone, you will still have to pay out the nose to gain the province. You will have to declare a second war if you want to exploit the bonuses of the Reconquest casus belli. To fully exploit both casus belli at the same time, then pause the game, declare war for Subjugation on Nevers and then declare war on Burgundy for Reconquest. You will have two separate wars with two separate goals.

Organization is what other games refer to as morale. It's that green bar that determines how likely your troops will break and run. Morale is a modifier that gives various bonuses. Discipline determines how many troops your armies will kill in battle (a Discipline rating of 115% will mean they will kill 15% more troops than a normal unit would).

Avoid going into important battles without a general. Even a crappy general with only 1 Shock will still add +1 to the dice rolls in battle during the Shock phase, your general has 2 Shock and the enemy general has 5 Shock. You will get no bonus while the enemy will get +3 to the dice rolls during the Shock phase. If there are multiple armies with multiple generals in the same battle, only the ""best"" (determined by the computer) general will support each side.

If you are fighting on a province where the only exit is a straight (Example: Venice, move a fleet into those waters. The straight is now blockaded, and if the enemy breaks and runs, they will be entirely annihilated because there's nowhere to go.

If there's a huge army coming to gank your small army that's left out in the open on your territory and there's no way to prevent it from happening, they will be facing HEAVY attrition. Building forts in bad terrains like mountains can also add to this attrition factor, since they will be taking more attrition (mountains) for much longer (forts). Playing a defensive Switzerland means playing an intelligent waiting game.

Vassals are good. Vassals are very good. You want them. You need them. Not only do they give you half their income and prevent you from increasing your research/stability costs (because they are semi-independent), ""sell"" them their core provinces you own for 0 ducats.

You can disembark units from your fleet during a naval battle, all it will take for you to ragequit is for the English fleet to engage your transport fleet before the troops had time to be loaded on.

**Colonizing:**

You can only colonize an inland province if you have a neighboring owned province

In a war with a nation that isn't fully explored (such as Mali) and you have no conquistadors? No problem! The game allows you to fully explore Terra Incognita provinces without a conquistador as long as they are owned by an enemy. Simply select a unit and click around the Terra Incognita until you get the standard red arrow. Your unit will move as normal and uncover the province

Tobacco, and Chinaware are all extremely valuable tradegoods, and provinces containing these will be a huge asset to your Centers of Trade. Prioritize colonizing these provinces.

Remember

See an enemy province that is a colony? You will immediately capture it if you move a unit there. From that point, send a colonist of your own to that region. As long as the colony wont grow to a full city by the time the colonist arrives, or wont grow to a full city because of the colonist, the entire culture and religion of the colony will change to yours once the colonist arrives. Why should you burn the colony? It takes a very long time for a province to convert culture and religion if you use a missionary, and if the enemy colony is already at 900 population or more, there is no chance of easily converting the culture or religion. You may as well just start over from scratch.

If you start colonizing Africa or the Americas, resulting in their total annexation. But whatever you do, do not ignore them. They will gain HUGE neighbor bonuses in their research, and you may just find yourself facing the same nation later on that has been properly westernized because you bordered them and didn't do a single thing about it.

Why do you think Austria, holding it, and then sending a colonist there. Just like normal colonization, once the colony reaches 1000, you now own the province, infamy free. Try to avoid making peace with the enemy before that happens.

**User Interface:**

Always keep the side menu and text log open. The text log can be opened by pressing the + button at the very bottom of the screen

Unless you want to look at something specific

Missed something important because you didn't pause the game quick enough? You can set windows or messages to pop up as a window and automatically pause the game. Right click the window in question and choose ""Popup and Pause"", rebellions, colonist results, and battle/siege results. To really make sure you're on top of your game, have the message Popup and Pause whenever an enemy unit starts sieging your territory, otherwise you might just miss out on a stack of rebels that wandered into your lands from somewhere else. You can also set these messages from the options screen.

**Misc:**

When you first start a game, it's the big boys; England, France, Castille, etc), you're only making the game harder for yourself. Once you get a firm grasp on the mechanics of the game, go ahead and make a new game with Lucky Nations.

There's only one firm goal in EU3: Do not get annexed. That's it. Every other goal in the game is self-imposed. Before you start a new game, game. You are not restricted in anything you want to do. You have over 400 years worth of self goals to achieve. Make the game as fun as you want it to be.",,False,self,t5_2su3h,False,,

Yesterday I made a [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/paradoxplaza/comments/ps535/ckii_the_feudal_system_and_its_implications/) on the feudal system featured in Crusader Kings II. Today, read on.

In Crusader Kings II you can construct buildings in your county capitals

Construction is a long-time prospect, where, and when.

**Where**

When constructing buildings
First, as buildings often won't pay back the investment within a single character's reign.  
Second, thus buildings in your capital will repay your investment faster.

Second, while vassals will only give you a percentage. In addition, the benefit you get from your vassals is also subject to change in the long term due to changes in opinion, while your own holdings are unaffected.

**What**

Your focus should be on improving your economic situation. The higher your income

After you have reached decent economic capital, so this should be relatively quick to do. As before, concentrate on your capital holding first, then go onto other holdings.

For each military building you construct, and as such gives you a base military capacity at all times, thus vastly improving your capabilities during civil wars and also helping you in both defensive and offensive wars.

**When**

In general

However, Scotland, having 50 gold in reserve at all times would likely be enough most of the time, but it wouldn't be enough if you suddenly needed to hire mercenaries. As such I would recommend a reserve of 100g at the very least for any realm, as then you'll be able to recruit a band of mercenaries and pay their upkeep for almost four months through your reserve alone.

**The Math**

For the economical buildings

For the castle town buildings

* Level 1
* Level 2
* Level 3
* Level 4
* Level 5

As you can see, your first goal should be level 2 in all holdings before you upgrade any further.

For the castle wall buildings

* Level 1
* Level 2
* Level 3
* Level 4
* Level 5

On an economical level, but their other benefits do of course make them worth it.

Now, thus giving you these numbers:

* Level 1 town, income 1.5 - 67 years
* Level 2 town, income 2.2 - 77 years
* Level 3 town, income 2.7 - 93 years
* Level 4 town, income 3.0 - 100 years
* Level 5 town, income 3.5 - 114 years

Note that the last two levels of towns do not need further wall upgrades. With wall upgrades taken into account we now get a gradual progression for how long it takes to get a return on your investment, makes the most sense.

**Vassal holdings**

Due to you only getting a percentage of your vassal's income and levies, as they give the exact same benefits except in full. 

While cities give higher revenue per town building than castles
Churches and cities however have one building each that can be useful: the monastic school and the university. The monastic school increases your tech growth in the province by 10% at level 1, while the university increases tech growth by 20% at level 1 and 30% at level 2, but level 2 comes quite late in the game. This can make a major difference in the long run, so if you favor a tech-based approach to the game, investing in this building can be a good idea.

**A Few Notes**

As long as you have good stewardship, at 30 state stewardship, you'll get 50% higher income, reducing the time to reach break-even by one third.

If your succession laws are gavelkind

You can also build new holdings in a county if there are free holding slots. Doing so costs 400 gold, at a base rate of 12 gold per year. However, even on harsh taxes this will take 75 years to repay itself, and is thus seldom worth it for the gold alone. However, constructing cities or temples does bring the added benefit of more tech growth slots, letting you speed up tech growth even more.
Castles will repay themselves in 166 years

**Summary**

* Build in your capital first
* Don't build anything in your vassal holdings
* For any specific building type
* Prioritize economic buildings over military buildings
* Always keep a reserve of at least 100g
* If you're under gavelkind succession laws,False,self,t5_2su3h,True,,moderator,t3_ptvxl

There's a well-known tactic to warfare: If you defeat an enemy army

Because China has a few provinces that has only one way out

Things you need: 2 (or more, armies guarding all of your own provinces that neighbor China, and a bit of courage.

[Step 1](http://i.imgur.com/xTnMj.jpg): Capture Qingdao AND Weihaiwei

[Step 2](http://i.imgur.com/UAEVM.jpg): Keep one army in your designated reinforcement province. This will be the army that slaughters any enemy that takes the bait. Move your other army to Qingzhou or Yizhou (doesn't matter which). It will be close enough for your standby army to come help if the enemy doesn't take the bait

[Step 3](http://i.imgur.com/JSjY2.jpg): When an enemy army moves into the bait province, the enemy will be completely eradicated, even if there were survivors, simply because Laizhou has a friendly army and is the only exit.

[Step 4](http://i.imgur.com/L4TYM.jpg): Move your armies back into position and wait for the next victim.

If all goes well, or free one of their puppet states.

This strategy can also be used in Port Arthur or Hainan (using one army to attack and a fleet to block the straight).",self,t5_2su3h,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/paradoxplaza/comments/148vhs/v2_the_chinese_deathtrap/

An ambitious liege without patience or genius traits might try to expand too much and start a war they can't win. A just king might do things that will piss off his vassals in the name of justice. And arbitrary rulers will basically ensure a generation of chaos for your realm. Also marriages are not about getting genius children but about political gains and so on. You don't educate your children from the ""best"" guy but rather by the guy you *trust* most (highest relations/matching traits). No ""gaming"" the system.

Has anyone ever done that? How did it turn out? I was considering ireland because they're rather secluded on their island but I'd have to read up a bit because if I decide to roleplay I'd want to adjust for the culture (and religion) of the character too and I don't know much about irish history at all.

Lately theres been a lot of posts bragging about massive empires, I find my game to be [very special](http://i.imgur.com/nsvM3.jpg).


This was my first game as a Christian ruler since SOI came out


About 100 years into the game I was bashing small counts and dukes in Ireland left and right


Now, I became Waldensian instead of Fraticelli. Oh well...

First thing I did as a heretic King was a small research to find out more about Waldensian beliefs. I never really cared about heresies, all in the name of Satan! I mean, why else would the church hunt them down? They must be the bad guys, right? 


Wrong! [Here is a nice read](http://www.anabaptistnetwork.com/waldensians) if you are interested. Turns out


Back to the game - the transition to heresy went pretty smooth. There were no rebellions


Soon I realized that now I have CB on **every piece of land** in the game


After I was done conquering Ireland I set my eyes on Scotland. I quickly learnt that I have no friends and everybody hates me. Even the catholic Queen of England would rather side with filthy Scottish dogs than help her own half-brother! I got completely steamrolled during my first holy war on Scottish lands. Not only England


I changed my strategy and took the opportunities while England was at war, a single Holy Order was almost as big as my entire army. 


The century of wars was over


* Denmark


* Norway


* Hungry


* France


* Russia (my dynasty)


* Byzantium (my dynasty)



At first I was a little disappointed because it was rather easy. But then the heretic king of Russia and his entire family were murdered. Oh well

Then the Byzantium Emperor somehow converted back to Catholicism. Hmmm... he is still my kinsman and his descendants will surely help me challenge HRE (spoiler: they never did)


But then my plans started to fall apart, I will try again in a few years"". ""No you won't, piss off"" said AI and changed succession laws to Agnatic Elective in all 3 kingdoms. Great.


And France.. France was a cornerstone in my crafty plan. And they were doing great! With my help the French king won a  few civil wars, and took some duchies in France. 

As years went by I took my opportunities and waged holy wars on English infidels while most of the catholic kingdoms were trying to stop Muslims in Iberia (spoilers: they failed). Holy Orders were a big pain the ass


Things were looking great until Pope decided to call another crusade on France. I quickly put my boys on boats and [set sail to capture Rome](http://i.imgur.com/8GIgd.jpg) before HRE would join the war. By the time the German doomstacks reached my lands I already had most of Papacy captured and managed to squeeze in a white peace. PHEW!


My Emperor never forgets and never forgives


Now was the time to face the Holy Roman Empire. They were the bastion of Catholicism in Europe, I took some lands. But soon my spymaster got kicked out and I run out of gold to hire thugs. 


And then, it took me about 60 years of constant Holy wars [to usurp the title](http://i.imgur.com/9xlo1.jpg), which I immediately destroyed, because changing the laws from Elective would have taken too much time. 


After that nothing exciting happened


Interesting stuff happens when you allow your vassals to pick wifes for themselves. Like [King Bjorn I](http://i.imgur.com/Xtr6s.jpg) of France or [King Cynfyn I](http://i.imgur.com/ylGWz.jpg) of Bavaria. 


I stopped playing because getting my [doomstacks](http://i.imgur.com/cYulj.jpg) together and putting them on boats took longer than the actual fighting


**TLDR:** Next time you get an offer to go heretic


Thank you for reading.

On this topic

Obviously Crusader Kings II is not inherently designed to teach you anything about history. The primary aim is entertainment. That being said, and social structures. 

I was wondering if you guys could fill out a quick survey (10 questions) I created for my class. I would love to have some data on the importance of historicity to the community - as well as if this game has impacted your knowledge of Medieval politics/history. 

I've already posted this on the paradox forums but I figure I can get more varied data by posting this here as well. 

https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/7GQ2KTD

Thanks

**Edit:**

In response to those interested in the results and the final paper:

Here are the [results](https://www.dropbox.com/s/266mc2nmkz5mug6/CK%20II_Results_Reddit.pdf) so far on Reddit (close to 300 respondents). 

This by no means indicates that the survey is closed; the more data the better!

Also, and there is a chance for me to get published.  

This survey is meant to help expand on my prior paper - and hopefully push it along to getting published. If that were to happen

1348066098.0,104ypm,5 De Jure Empire in 150 years; A Heretic's Story [x-post from /r/CrusaderKings],Emergency87,53,4,34,"Greetings

After reading [this mini-AAR] (http://www.reddit.com/r/paradoxplaza/comments/yl0oj/ck2_miniaar_from_a_humble_welsh_count_to_the/) about a month ago, and partly to help other aspiring heretics out there who might want to overthrow the Pope's cruel yoke (and gain access to the [holy war CB on all Catholic lands](http://imgur.com/HIAyi)).

I used the ruler designer

Anyhow, so I started by pressing my de jure claims and uniting all of Scotland, whilst punishing any of my unruly vassals (who I had, admittedly, provoked myself) and taking their lands. 

By 1086, however, wasn't created, so I didn't get an opinion penalty with my vassals.

Meanwhile

While I waited to become a heretic, all of both Ireland and Wales were mine, and one of my provinces had become Lollard! I immediately moved my capital there, to better my chances of becoming a heretic. I also considered inviting heretics to court and having one of them educate my heir, but this would prove to be unnecessary as in 1109 I finally got my chance and became a [Lollard](http://imgur.com/ZWjWE). The Pope had lost a Crusade and my Antipope had been buzzing in the faithful's ears for about 20 years at that point, so Catholicism's moral authority was actually at roughly [25%](http://imgur.com/nmO4C) when it happened. 

My first few years as a heretic were rough. I tried to wage war against England

Thankfully though, I cunningly betrothed my heir to the king of France, which I do believe prevented him from joining his coreligionists in their battle against the heretics from the north. 

In any event, but it hardly mattered because my character had been maimed in battle and I thought he would die soon. Also notable: I mainly used 'shock and awe' tactics in all these wars; hardly any sieges, only assaults. As a heretic, ending a war early is the best thing you can do.

The next big test of my mettle was in 1127, so the Pope's strongest allies were the [Knights Hospitaller and the King of Poland](http://i.imgur.com/4Mnn9.jpg). Despite my character dying mid-war, I was able to sack Rome and force the Pope to surrender, which reduced his moral authority to almost nothing.

The next step was taking France, I quickly noticed that if the HRE was engaged in a war of its own, it usually wouldn't join any other wars at the same time. So, for the next 30 years, I was very opportunistic; if the HRE wasn't at war, I took land in Iberia or Scandinavia (I was strong enough to fight the various alliances in both areas, although not at the same time). If the opposite was true and the HRE was at war

I was eventually able to take Normandy, and Valois by 1157, and usurp the Kingdom of France, leading to [this](http://i.imgur.com/jRjcK.jpg) situation. During the mop-up, I realized that Europe had become a real [cesspit of heresy,](http://i.imgur.com/ndjOZ.jpg) so I actually had to press de jure ducal and monarchical claims in some cases, and even fabricate claims in others. 

This proved to be Empress Marjorie's undoing. I noticed that the Duke of Aragon's heir was Catholic while he was not

Anyways, has ruled from 1173 to 1215, and is now 61 years old. He waged near-constant holy war all over Christendom, and is now the ruler of [five de jure empires](http://imgur.com/xmvlD), as well as Poland and Lithuania, only 150 years after his great-great granfather Guillaume I first ascended to the throne of Scotland. Moral of the story: why be a good Christian and listen to that silly Pope down in Rome, when you could be a mighty [Lollard](http://imgur.com/zZATQ)?

So that's my story! I've you've made it this far

I'd love to hear from others who have played as heretics
any tips/tricks for playing as a heretic character. It seems to me that starting off is definitely the hardest part; once you become Emperor

Anyways

Celebrate with a raffle for free games.,derkrieger,55,11,225,"To celebrate our reaching 2000 subscribers Paradox Interactive has supplied us with a couple of keys for several games from their vast catalog. Everybody is encouraged to enter for a chance to win a free game. To enter all you do is leave a comment with the name of the game you wish to enter the drawing for. You may only enter the drawing for **one game**. Each game has 2 copies for me to hand out though if you want to have a better chance of winning find a game you like with fewer entries.

I will place all the names in a hat and draw them to determine the winners on Saturday June 16th. You may edit your entry at any time if you change your mind so don't worry about posting early as only the name you have posted on the 16th when I do the drawing will count.

**List of Games you can enter to win:**

*Crusader Kings II*

*Warlock: Master of the Arcane*

*Naval War Arctic Circle*

*King Arthur II*

*Salem Beta Key*

All of these keys (minus Salem) activate on Steam. See you all on the 16th.

**EDIT: I'm gonna need a bigger hat...**

**EDIT 2: Thanks to r0manz we now have 3 beta keys for Salem

I have seen many people introduced to these kind of games while here and even veterans getting their questions answered.

Recently though there seems to be fewer and fewer posts about official Paradox related news/discussions and more image posts. I enjoy the occasional history joke as much as the next guy and there are some great After-Action-Reports that are put up as a mixture of image galleries/written stories however the number of random image posts has grown greatly and they are starting to occupy a majority of the front page for the subreddit. 

Now the question I pose to all of you is as such: *What content do you find appropriate for /r/paradoxplaza and why? Do you wish there were more or less of certain kinds of post?*

Let's keep this discussion nice and civil as I want everybody's opinion on this so we can lay down some new ground rules if the community feels we need them. We have so far been mature enough to self moderate but if we need a list of rules displayed on the sidebar ---&gt; then we can get those put up as well.

**Edit: It seems the general consesus so far is that we don't need to worry about anything yet. The community is capable of controlling itself and gives it the content it demands. Sorry if I appeared so negative about the whole thing I just wanted to address any concerns and make sure we plan for the future. The only real rule out of this is no random non-paradox content/memes which was really already an unofficial rule. How do you guys feel about people discussing games that are similar to Paradox games but not done by Paradox? Does that fly

**I am glad to see everybody enjoys the community we have here and you all ensure that it stays a healthy community. The hardest thing I have to do as a moderator around here is checking the damn spam filter after it gobbles up some appropriate post.**",self,t5_2su3h,1363288474.0,,moderator,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/paradoxplaza/comments/1a9tif/rparadoxplaza_official_discussion_what_kind_of/

If you don't have a casus belli against an independent realm, losing, or stalemating the war depends upon the casus belli you are pushing. In any single war you can only push a single casus belli, so you should make sure to push whichever casus belli benefits you the most. With the exception of the Tribal Invasion CB, all CBs incur a 10-year truce. Do note that truces only apply to a specific character, and only the attacker is restricted. So if the attacker or defender dies, the truce is moot

**The Basics**

If you don't have a casus belli against an independent realm, losing, or stalemating the war depends upon the casus  belli you are pushing. In any single war you can only push a single casus belli, so you should make sure to push whichever casus belli benefits you the most. With the exception of the Tribal Invasion CB, all CBs incur a 10-year truce.

**Claim CBs**

Most casus belli, you can push this claim through war. If you have multiple personal claims upon a single realm you can push all of them at once, but you can only push a single claim for any other character per war.

If you have a claim upon a title you have a certain 'right' to this title. Upon winning a claim war you, and if you were pushing it for someone their opinion of you will increase by 100, and you'll gain 100 prestige. If it ends in a stalemate you'll lose 100 prestige, and if it ends in loss, the claim will be lost in addition to 200 prestige. When pushing a vassal's claim and losing you'll have to pay concessions.

**De Jure CBs**

If you or a vassal hold a duchy

Unlike regular claims, or if you were pushing the de jure claim for someone else they'll gain the county as a vassal, have their opinion of you increased by 100, and you'll gain 100 prestige. When pushing a vassal's claim and losing you'll have to pay concessions.

**Change Law CBs**

There are several CBs based around changing realm laws, Elective, Seniority, or Primogeniture, and lowering crown authority.

The first four can be used on your liege as long as they don't have the succession type in question. The lower crown authority CB can be used on your liege if he's a king or emperor. You cannot use these CBs more than one step up the chain

If you win the war

**Independence CB**

As long as you're someone's vassal, and if you lose you'll be imprisoned and lose 200 prestige. Like with changing law, you cannot use this CB more than one step up the chain.

**Depose Liege CB**

As long as no one else is trying to depose your liege, and your liege will depose to the eligible heir you like the most. If you stalemate you'll lose 100 prestige, and if you lose you'll be imprisoned and lose 200 prestige. Like with changing law, you cannot use this CB more than one step up the chain.

**Overthrow Ruler CB**

As long as you're someone's vassal, crown authority will go down one step. In addition, if your liege held any other titles, he'll be forced to abdicate them to his heir. If you stalemate you'll lose 100 prestige, and if you lose you'll lose 200 prestige and be imprisoned. Like with changing law, you cannot use this CB more than one step up the chain.

**Dispute Succession CB**

If you're a pretender to your liege's throne, and if it was a kingdom or empire crown authority will be reduced by one. White peace is impossible. If you lose, you'll be imprisoned, lose 200 prestige, and lose the claim.

**Invasion CB**

If you have a claim upon a throne or you're smaller than the realm in question (that is, you can use the invasion CB. Upon victory you'll get the throne in question, 400 prestige, and every occupied holding. As such, you should occupy every holding before enforcing demands, as then you can install your own nobles. If you stalemate you'll lose 100 prestige. If you lose you'll lose 200 prestige, and have to pay concessions


**Tribal Invasion CB**

You'll never get to use this CB unless you mod the game. It essentially just lets tribes like the Golden Horde and the Timurids attack anyone they neighbor

**Crusade CB**

If the Pope has called a crusade, and if you lose you'll lose 150 piety and 200 prestige.

**Religious War CB**

If you're in a different religious group than your target, you can declare a religious war. Upon victory you'll gain 50 prestige and all holdings (as long as they're occupied by you, or unoccupied) in the targeted duchy. If you stalemate you'll lose 50 piety and 100 prestige, and if you lose you'll lose 150 piety, 200 prestige, and be forced to pay concessions.

**Religious Assistance CB**

If another realm in your religion is being targeted by a Religious War CB, and losing will losing will lose you 150 piety, 200 prestige, and you'll be forced to pay concessions.

**Excommunicated Ruler CB**

If someone has the same head of religion as you, and the target will be re-communicated and forced to abdicate. A white peace will lose you 50 piety and 100 prestige. Losing will lose you 100 piety, 200 prestige, and you'll be forced to pay concessions.",,False,self,True,t3_q2qwb

For me

During colonization I focus first on Warri and its two neighboring provinces as these always seem to change to rubber later and will use as many colonial points as I can reasonably use to ensure I get those provinces.  Late game rubber is a key to military superiority and getting this as opposed to wool/grain/cattle areas of Africa pays dividends later.

I always try

I have never signed the Geneva Convention

I try to colonize the Pacific territories purely to release them later for the -5 infamy.

Going for most/all of Sokoto pre-1870 to set myself up to quickly colonize most of Africa.

I always try to help the South win the Civil War. (pre-HoD you could intervene if you influenced them to friendly, then peace out with whatever I can get).
