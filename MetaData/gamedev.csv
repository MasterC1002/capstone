&gt; **Was it worth it? The numbers don't seem to translate into a very good salary.**

&gt; Without a doubt, spread out among four people to account for almost 2 years of development is not particularly impressive, considering that more money could have been made at normal jobs, without taking the considerable risks that we took. However, it's important to note that the entire time we were doing what we loved, not for the goal of a monetary reward, but in order to make something beautiful come into existence.

1367566592.0,1dlwc4,Procedural Dungeon Generation Algorithm Explained,phidinh6,643,83,84,"So today I'm going to be a little different and talk about one technical aspect of my game [TinyKeep](http://tinykeep.com)

The interactive demo can be found here:
[Dungeon Generation Demo](http://tinykeep.com/dungen/)

Here's how I do it

1 . First I set the number of cells I want to generate

2 . For each ""cell"" I spawn a Rectangle of random width and length within some radius. Again the radius doesn't matter too much

Instead of using uniformly distributed random numbers (the default Math.random generator in most languages)

In addition to this I ensure that the ratio between the width and length of each cell is not too large

3 . At this point we have 150 random cells in a small area

4 . We fill in any gaps with 1x1 sized cells. The result is that we end up with a square grid of differently sized cells

5 . Here is where the fun begins. We determine which of the cells in the grid are rooms - any cell with a width and height above a certain threshold is made into a room. Because of the Park-Miller Normal Distribution described earlier

6 . For the next stage we want to link each room together. To begin we construct a graph of all of the rooms' center points using [Delaunay Triangulation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation). So now all rooms are connected to each other without intersecting lines.

7 . Because we don't want every single room to be linked to every other with a corridor (that would make for a very confusing layout)

8 . The minimal spanning tree looks nice, each guaranteed to be reachable and containing some loops for variety.

9 . To convert the graph to corridors, perfect for a dungeon.

And here's an example of the finished result!

The second is that Valve is running an experiment. Traditionally Valve has been a very good place for very experienced videogame developers

&gt;What is the objective of the website itself?

&gt;We want to establish a connection to the world of teenagers that are asking many questions about getting into the gaming industry. We look to answer many of these questions and are willing to reach out to the community and give them the information they need.

* [Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/3J9he.png)

* [Trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbEJ3x4mI3M)

I thought you might be interested in my journey from someone who literally knows **nothing** about programming to a published game developer. I know that this type of post would have been really helpful for me when was just getting started. Hopefully I can inspire someone in a similar situation!

**THE STORY**

About a year and a half ago

I always thought it would be pretty sweet to be a game developer but it was so out of reach that it never felt like a realistic goal. But one day in October of 2010 I just decided to go for it. I had nothing to lose so why not?

I learned bits and pieces of a bunch of languages, ActionScript, and Objective-C. Honestly though, I really don’t think it matters too much what languages you learn on. If there is one piece of advice that I can share about learning to program, it is this: **PROGRAM A LOT**. There really is no other way to learn besides doing, doing, doing, and doing again. Every time you make something new

Along the way I made a ton of stupid

* [A game about a man-rodent](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/dtplj/thought_you_might_be_interested_in_my_very_first/) hiding in a town
* [A text-based minesweeper clone]( http://youtu.be/Cn_Oibc4sjg) with a custom-sized board and mine-count
* [A game called Pizza Guy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HLumD97DX8)
* [A game called Party Man](http://www.whitakerblackall.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/1000000423.png), so he kept literally crashing the party.
* [An app where you could create sequences of musical phrases](http://youtu.be/xWMsBGEwvbY) in the pentatonic scale
* [A flash clone of the classic snake game](http://whitakerblackall.com/wp-content/uploads/Racer.swf)
* [A flash clone of those driving-through-an-ever-shrinking-tunnel games](http://whitakerblackall.com/wp-content/uploads/Racer.swf)

Finally,” as if there were one way to make a game. But I realized I just need to make it however I could, even if it wasn’t necessarily the right or best way.

When I sent the game to beta testers, then I’m done!” a thousand times.

Submitting to the app store was terrifying. I was so paranoid that I would forget something huge. Something that could break the game or get it rejected. But at the same time, was done. I went from not knowing a thing about programming to finishing a game that I was very very proud of.

It’s already gotten some awesome previews on [Touch Arcade](http://toucharcade.com/2012/04/19/hands-on-with-whitaker-trebellas-polymer/)

Of course, programming Polymer has taught me so many amazing things. There’s a lot of really messy spaghetti code, but I honestly don’t care too much because it works. Next time I make a game I’ll be able to build upon what I’ve learned, and hopefully make something even more awesome. Until then though, I’m hoping for the best with Polymer. And I hope you enjoy it!

* Today my first game

* I did all the programming

1366010909.0,1cdlp9,Why Kickstarters Fail and How to Avoid It (x-post from r/indiegaming),NintendoEnthusiast,528,78,40,"As an introduction let me just say I've been working as a liaison between Nintendo and indie developers for the past few months and have succeeded in bringing over around 15-20 new indie games to Wii U and 3DS. I've emailed back and forth developers who were running Kickstarters and through this I started to get some insight as to why many promising Kickstarter campaigns fail. They may seem like simple common sense (and they are) but they still seem to be overlooked too often.

I wrote this so hopefully I can provide some insight to indie developers who may be starting a Kickstarter campaign in the near future. I hope it helps.

I'll quote the whole article but the original is found here: http://nintendoenthusiast.com/15245/kickstarter-feature-part-1-why-kickstarters-fail-and-how-to-avoid-it/


""I’ve had the opportunity of observing a fair few video game Kickstarter campaigns over the past few weeks from a close proximity. Some succeeded

It’s not magic or voodoo. Having a really good idea just doesn’t cut it on Kickstarter. There are some clear-cut factors that should be taken into account from the start. Of course

**1. Understand the Difference Between the ""Developer-Publisher"" Partnership and the ""Developer-Community"" Partnership**

Very often developers think that all a Kickstarter means is that you work hard on a Kickstarter page and then if you succeed, you have to make sure they see clearly that this a relationship that includes them as an equal partner.

Now

First of all, you want to show them how you understand their mindset and how you're a gamer just like them with specific things that appeal to you. Only, you happen to be a gamer with incredible expertise and experience in the development side of gaming. So show both of those. Show them your gamer side but also your expertise.

Secondly, on the original Kickstarter page tell them where you have already planned for them to be involved.

Third: provide lots of updates. Nothing spells doom to your prospective community more than a campaign-leader who stops providing updates. You must treat your backers like your own personal fanbase and the more you interact with your community, but there should be some sense of momentum.

Lastly

**2. The Project Isn’t Far Enough Along**

One of the biggest attitudes you have to have when making a Kickstarter campaign is: don’t expect to be like Double Fine. Double Fine succeeded in their Double Fine Adventure Kickstarter campaign because they were Double Fine. All Tim Schafer had to do was say he wanted to make another point-and-click adventure game and fans were already gathering in throngs to throw money at his feet. There didn’t have to be anything that remotely resembled a real game prepared for the campaign. But that is the exception to the rule. Only developers or franchises that have incredible persuasion among fans (usually due to nostalgia) can rely on that. Everyone else needs to have incredible content ready to show off.

Kickstarters are always found somewhere along a certain chronological line in the development process:

A) There are those who launch a Kickstarter with nothing but an idea or a “pitch” to the fans. The entire game is still an abstract idea and they must convince the backers that it’s a good one that deserves backing.

Pros and Cons: The advantage of this approach is that you will have the backing from the get-go and won’t have to cover any initial costs on your own if your target is high enough. The disadvantage is that there is a high risk of failing because no one believes in your project until there is something to see. (Of course

B) Others wait until they have concept art prepared which will give their backers a mental image of the abstract game idea they had. These pieces of art are often all there is for backers to see for many weeks on end.

Pros and Cons: Again, it’s a really crippling way to begin your campaign.

C) Some campaigns begin with a prototype video of their game. Their team has already begun to flesh out the game concept with their game engine. The video they show off is usually very early on in the development and can often be crude or very undeveloped. There aren’t many scenes of the game to demonstrate in the video yet. This too is meant to give backers a very early mental image of what the game will eventually look like.

Pros and Cons: This is where the majority of Kickstarter campaigns begin, but many others will superficially walk away. They have to be sold on the game video, and there isn’t enough to sell them on it. The advantage of this approach is that the developers only have to fork over the cash for the initial stages of the project. The rest of the time they can ride home free on the support of their backers.

D) Then there are those teams that have advanced the game enough in development that their initial video is able to give a very good representation of the final vision. With a little more time and effort they would probably even be able to turn it into a demo for their fans to try. Some Kickstarters even decide to begin their campaign with a playable demo.

Pros and Cons: In my opinion

E) Finally

Pros and Cons: Sometimes these projects actually fail because the fans feel like you’re taking advantage of them. You already paid your way through most of the development and now you’re just using them in the last stretch. Fans want to feel like they were a part of the development process. They want to make decisions through polls and have a say. They want to come along for the ride with the weekly or monthly updates. Of course

—-

So



**3. The Target Is Too High**

This rule is simple. Sometime you see two very similar projects and one succeeds on Kickstarter and the other doesn’t. The difference? One aimed for $5,000 and the other for $50,000. They both could end up raising $45,000 but the second one loses it all when they don’t reach their target by the end of the campaign.

I know this is easier said than done because at the end of the day

It’s better to aim a bit lower than what you hope for but make the target one that is easy to reach. There is no set formula for doing this because every game is different. So

And remember: Kickstarter campaigns that succeed, you should find a way to include that in your target plans. Drop your initial target by a little bit and assume that if you succeed you will get a that extra bit added on to the final funding.


**4. Lack of PR**

Oh boy. This is the golden rule in my opinion. This is where I have seen first-hand the majority of Kickstarters fail. Kickstarters are so often run by brilliant individuals: game developers. And that means that their expertise is in coding and expert game design. What they usually haven’t had much experience in is dealing with PR. Usually

Working on two video game websites means that a large part of my day is working in PR/marketing. Whether it’s paying attention to how one build’s awareness of their brand on the internet, these all have been my bread and butter for the past year and a half. So, when I noticed the lack of exposure in many Kickstarter campaigns it wasn’t hard for me to realize why many of the most promising ones were failing.

Again, “KaBOOM!” Don’t expect your campaign to go viral like that unless you are well-known in the gaming world. If you’re like everyone else, you’re going to have to launch a PR campaign to get anyone to notice your project.

Basically

Instead of sending a press release

So, these are the ones that report on Kickstarters, so they are more likely to publish your story:

A) Kickstarters are practically the life blood of these sites and they will almost definitely spread the word to the Kickstarter community:

indiegames.com
Jayisgames
Rockpapershotgun
TIGSource
Indiegamemag
DIYgamer

If you want to really go thoroughly through all the decently-sized indie sites that would talk about your game this is a great list: http://www.pixelprospector.com/the-big-list-of-indie-game-sites/

B) These sites are massive but they are the ones that also report on Kickstarter campaigns pretty often. As long as a Kickstarter looks promising or has an interesting twist or innovation

Venturebeat/Gamesbeat
Gamesradar
Kotaku
Joystiq
Gameinformer
Shacknews
Eurogamer
Destructoid
Escapist Magazine
VG247
Videogamer.com
Gamezone.com
PC Gamer
Gamasutra
Polygon

C) Finally

 
Don’t give up after a week if you don’t see the campaign succeeding. Keep on doing relentless PR or look for another angle to get the engines started.

Which takes them to the page in their browser? It's cool and all but they have to log in to SteamPowered.com and usually do the steamguard thing which deters some voters (I had some complaints on Twitter which is why I decided to work on this).

And you know how you can use Steam to open certain embedded urls by going Start-&gt;Run-&gt;steam://url/SomethingHere/SomeIdHere?

Well
**steam://url/CommunityFilePage/112030991**

So that URL will open Steam and take someone straight to your Greenlight. One problem is that you probably want to share it on Twitter and Facebook
    **&lt;?php
        header('Location: steam://url/CommunityFilePage/112030991');
    ?&gt;**

Now, Steam will open on their computer directly to your greenlight page! 

I created a special subdomain for mine that makes it easier to read: http://greenlight.blackannex.net/ which is literally just that code I linked above.

I hope this helps you all get more votes and brings you closer to getting your cool games on Steam! Good luck! :D

###Source Control
This one is a bit of a no-brainer, either wasted time, code confusion, 

Here are some useful source control links and information

##**Perforce**
This is a personal favorite of mine, and is very easy to learn. I would also argue that Perforce is a professional standard and all of the major games studios use it, so it is worth learning if you ever want to work for a larger game studio (Some people disagree with this point, but this is my opinion, based on all my previous jobs at large games studios) - [Perforce Link](http://www.perforce.com/).

##**Git**
It is worth learning Git purely because it will make your understanding of source control so much better. Git is fast becoming one of the leading source control solutions and there are a number of branches of the git framework that are used throughout the source control world. Public open source depots and online collaboration is also a great reason for learning Git - [GitHub](https://github.com/).

##**SVN**
I would consider SVN the younger brother of source control solutions


###Time Management
Having good time management skills will mean the difference between a game that gets completed and a game that you will be developing for the rest of your life. Working on your time management takes time and there always many ways in which you can become a better scheduler and better use your time more efficiently.

##**Todo Lists**

I am a bit of an OCD list maker myself

* Use your phone to make notes for you when you are not physically at your computer and able to access you main to do lists.
* Send email reminders to yourself with bullet points of stuff that you have thought about during the day.
* Try to organize and priorities your lists. Have a different list/category for small tasks and bugs (5-10 minutes)
* If you are using dev tracking software, subtasks and bugs.

##**DevTracking**

Using some kind of tool to track your development tasks and bugs can be a great help. There are many benefits to having a tool like this that you can access anywhere and online

Here are some useful online dev tracking tools:

* [youTRACK](http://www.jetbrains.com/youtrack/)
* [JIRA](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira)
* [Trello](https://trello.com/) - Thanks zaikman
* [http://todoist.com/](http://todoist.com/)
* [Top 10 Open Source Bug Tracking System](http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2010/08/bug-tracking-system/)

##**Pomodoro Technique**

I recently mentioned the [Pomodoro Technique](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) in another thread and a lot of people hadn't heard of this before. I find this method of working in discreet pre-defined periods of time with no breaks works really well for me and I would recommend that you at least give it a go. It might not work for you and some critics dont like it as a way of working, even if game development is a hobby for you or something you do in your spare time, having a solid working schedule will help improve your productivity.


###Build Processes

One way that most developers waste time is by having inefficient build processes. You would be surprised how much time gets wasted if you do something redundant that takes up 5 seconds of your time every time you make a build. Even just reducing your build time and processes by a few seconds can save you whole hours over the course of your development A good way to start improving your build processes is to start small

Some common things to look out for in your build process that can be automated:

* Copying header files to a root include directory
* Placing lib or DLL files into your source directory
* Converting asset files, audio, etc.
* Copying the output exe to a 'deployed' folder after a compile.


##**Batch Files**

If you are doing lots of manual file operations, then these processes can all be automated by using batch files. 

Here are some links to help get your started in learning batch programming:

* [Batch Files and Commands](https://cs.senecac.on.ca/~albert.pang/ios100/dosbatch.html)
* [How to Write a Batch File](http://www.wikihow.com/Write-a-Batch-File)
* [Windows Powershell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_PowerShell)


##**Pre and post build steps**

If you are using Visual Studio, the the Pre and Post build steps are the place to do that! Combined with good use of batch files (as mentioned above) you can really automated pretty much your whole build pipeline.

The ultimte goal of refining your build processes is to have it so that you can setup

###Productivity
* //TODO : Write me
* *In the mean time see this article: http://gamedev.tutsplus.com/articles/business-articles/1gam-how-to-succeed-at-making-one-game-a-month/*

###Stay positive!

This is really a difficult goal to achieve

* Show your work to friends and family.
* Seek out feedback often and solicit suggestions.
* Ignore the negative people! - Good, with nothing useful or constructive to say.
* Join gamedev communities - you are already on the right path just by being in here, gamedev.net, etc. Go and join them also!
* Take breaks from your work when you are feeling the drain - Go outside, etc... anything to get your away from the computer for a few hours (or days sometimes).
* Take inspiration from others and get involved with other games developers.

Well that was a long post and I hope that it contains some useful information for you. It really gets me down seeing all the negative posts on /r/gamedev recently. Lets try to stay positive and keep this gamedev community happy and strong!

Randy Gaul (whom you might know from his [Game Programming Primer](http://www.randygaul.net/2013/01/06/game-programming-primer/)) has written us a tutorial series about building a 2D physics engine for games.

* [Part 1: The Basics and Impulse Resolution](http://hub.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-create-a-custom-2d-physics-engine-the-basics-and-impulse-resolution--gamedev-6331)

1371471364.0,1giewv,Breaking into game design: Part 1 - find your mountain [x-post from r/gamedesign],FamousAspect,366,50,49,"Before I left to work on [Enhanced Wars](http://quarterspiral.com/#Home)


Since I left BioWare


I find myself repeating a few pieces of advice over and over again about how to break into the industry as a game designer. I thought it would be valuable to take my perspective as a hiring manager and turn it into a series of articles about how to position yourself best to land that first gig.


*A big caveat - I am just one hiring manager with one perspective. Each company you are trying to work for and person you are trying to impress is different. These tactics would definitely work if you were trying to land a job on my team. Personal mileage may vary.*


**Step 1 - find your mountain**
In 2012 one of my favorite authors


&gt; ""Something that worked for me was imagining that where I wanted to be ... was a mountain. A distant mountain. My goal.
&gt;
&gt;And I knew that as long as I kept walking towards the mountain I would be all right. And when I truly was not sure what to do


This is important because game design is a broad profession. In any given day working on [Enhanced Wars](http://quarterspiral.com/#Home) I might write a design document. I might wireframe some UI or spec out a UX flow. I might tweak tuning values in a spreadsheet all day long or lay out levels. I might do narrative work or write copy for menu screens. I might spend all day fixing bugs in scripting files. I might plan out a monetization strategy.


This list doesn't come close to defining all that goes into the bucket of game design. Even more important than tasks is genre and platform of game you want to work on. For instance, I would need to spend a minimum of 6 months preparing before I could apply for that job from a space of confidence.


Your mountain will change many times over the course of your career. New opportunities will arise


Do your research and figure out what sort of job you will want to pursue as a designer. My best advice - look at job postings on Gamasutra and the websites of companies you admire. Read about the actual requirements


And a word of advice, you will never never make it to the top.

1)  Get organized. Like others have said elsewhere, [Assembla](http://www.assembla.com/), or anything like it. We used Assembla to hold all of our code because of prior experience with it. Having all of your code on something like this allows you to easily revert back to a previously saved version, which saves hours of headaches in the future, as well as easily integrates changes from multiple people quickly and efficiently.

2)  Get a task board. I suggest [SeeNowDo](http://www.seenowdo.com), graphics, sound, game mechanics, etc. This allows you to keep track of what needs to be done, and who is working on it! You can track hours per task, as well as list their current states like in progress, blocked

3) PLAN PLAN PLAN! If I could change one thing about how I ran things last semester and this semester, this should be #1.

4)  Something we've learned along the way, just one. A dev at Bioware explained to us that they wanted to make an RPG that focused on choices via interactive story. The combat and other parts of the game were really basic, nothing dramatically differed from other games, or at least they didn't plan for it to. Find a key thing to do, and do it well, knock it out of the park. If it's story, a cool game mechanic, stick with it

5)  Be realistic. We started out wanting to do an Action-RPG, characters, art, etc. was a bad idea; a really, really bad idea. Starting a year early gives you some time, but you need to make sure you keep realistic. Start off really small, and work your way to something larger. You'd rather have something small take longer than you thought

6)  Do not compare your games depth to that of a AAA game release, only to realize the game had been worked on for 2 years by graduate students. Don't get me wrong, set your bar high, and just realize you probably don't have a dedicated 9-5 team on your hands 5 days of the week, so you can't produce something like that. Produce the best thing you can, with what you have.

7)  Realize what you have resource wise. Every design team is different. All year long we struggled to have art done for out game. We're mostly programmers with a few artists

8)  If you have a large enough team, make them the enemy programmer on the game mechanics team. This gives someone something specific to do, and allows someone to thoroughly know this.

9)  Have only 1, and allowed all sorts of problems to arise. You need someone with a vision for the game, and then you need to have them produce this vision via the other members. In the best scenario, they would know enough programming, art, etc., to communicate effectively with programmers, etc. As long as they can hold a vision for your focus of the game

I'll add more to this as I think of it or as other members of the club smack me around until I add it.

---

*I have promised to write a post-mortem on the [Strike Suit Zero Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/43153532/strike-suit-zero) for a while now. I haven’t done so for many reasons
 
For lots of reasons outside of my control as well as the studio’s
 
As a short side note
 
**The Campaign**
 
Back in September last year, we decided to take the issue to the existing community (while it was small, it was there and had been built for the past 3-4 months) and see if crowdfunding could help fill in the cash gap needed to finish the game and add some polish.
 
The campaign was launched on the 18th of October with a $100,804 from 4,484 backers.
 
The game itself was released on the 23rd of January 2013.
 
During the campaign
 
- The Marauder Strike Suit – DLC for a different Strike Suit ship. Added to the game on the 23rd of March 
- The Heroes of the Fleet – DLC of 5 additional missions. Added to the game on the 20th of May 
- The Mod tool (as a $130
- The Oculus-support beta (as an optional add-on for a symbolical $1). It has started last week for some of the Kickstarter backers.
- The Mac and Linux support. The stretch goal wasn’t met (barely, as promised in the stretch goal. Mac beta has just started last week.
 
Overall
 
 
**What worked and what were the unexpected  benefits**
 
These are just not mine – I asked Benjamin and Chris from the studio to contribute to this list:
 
1. Good planning. Ahead of the campaign, but it would have been way worse without all the prep.
 
2. Dedicated resource. Jamin (the studio’s community manager) was on the campaign full time; talking to the backers
 
3. Involving the team in the campaign. Getting them in the video and the updates was good for morale but also showed the identity of the studio.
 
4. Excellent PR impact. 47 (in the US) and ICO (in Europe) were managing the PR for the game at the time and the coverage the game got during the Kick Starter campaign accelerated massively.. I don’t think that back then being on Kickstarter was a story in itself already, but if you do have a story to go with your campaign, it will make it possible for the message to spread more easily.
 
5. Joysticks. I mentioned this at events where I am talking about the campaign
 
6. Studio financial health. Without the Kickstarter money, so imagine what would have happened) and it would have been at the cost of  redundancies or  possible worse. The extra money then was essential not just to get a better game out, but to give the studio enough rope to release it properly. It is now in a much better shape and was able to self-finance the stand-alone score chaser based on Strike Suit Zero for instance (Strike Suit Infinity).
 
7. Junji and Paul were ace. Junji Okubo is the mecha designer behind the Strike Suit and the ships design. Paul Ruskay is the composer of the music. They both gave us incredible support. Paul waved some of his rights to the music for the rewards of the Kickstarter campaign. Junji offered to design mechas for the $10, compared to $40 for the rest of the world).
 
8. Merch. An unexpected benefit of the campaign was the sudden access to a number of merchandise opportunities. While the studio hasn’t made any plans to sell them for now
 
9. Team morale. I couldn’t judge from this first hand
 
 
**What went wrong and unexpected problems**
 
1. Paypal. It went live way too late and was difficult to manage. It was put together in a rush and nobody in the studio had proper experience with it. This was a missed opportunity and had we had it up and running earlier the impact on teh overall campaign could have been much larger.
 
2. Lack of some skills within the studio. Nobody in the studio has experience putting websites together. The game’s website was a placeholder (and a bad one) for most of the campaign and when the main one went live, when backers were researching the game beyond its Kickstarter page. It probably didn’t help  build up the credibility of the project.
 
3. Stretch Goals. Because the campaign was to finish the project, you really don’t want to offer to add XYZ that will delay your game again. It limited the capacity for the studio to push for more funds beyond the initial goal. It is still great that the Mod tool could be added as this was a much demanded feature by the community. In retrospect though, maybe more things could have been added, I think we may have been overly cautious there.
 
4. Unprepared for the Kickstarter back-end. While this wasn’t the biggest of issues as SSZ wasn’t a multi-million campaign
 
5. OST CDs. While I think the rewards were well structured and generally working,000 CDs produced. We should have kept the signed CD at that relatively high level and offer un-signed CDs at a lower level.
 
6. T-shirts and hoodies. While the Insert Coins folks were super supportive, we had quality issues. It mostly comes from inexperience with managing these kind of products – and the delays with them.
 
7. Pricing. When planning the campaign, with a few, very anecdotal perks. BUT – when launching on Steam, you usually do a discount, in our case this was 20% off, meaning the game was at $16 at launch… That went way over our heads back when planning (and while we did research what other projects have done, very few had launched and encountered this issue – I now know that others ran into the same problem) and we got criticized by some backers, but that was their perception). There was also strong support from another part of the backer community which answered  the criticism better than the studio could have and basically said they were fine with what happened with the pricing as “Kickstarter is about crowdfunding, with the studio offering discount codes for the new content to the backers for instance. The idea was always to keep backers happy – and the studio has  this very much in mind.
 
8. Rewards system in Kickstarter. We always knew that we would not be able to edit the rewards after the campaign was launched, despite explaining it wasn’t the case at different points on the page. I definitely recommend going with the current best practice to name the rewards and reference them by that name when you need to.
 
9. Kickstarter documentation. There are quite a few things that you need to learn as you do them on Kickstarter. The way surveys work and advice on how to maximize their use could use some love on the documentation side. Nowhere on the site (it was true back then and it is  still true now) are you  told that after the campaign YOU CANNOT CHANGE THE MAIN PAGE ANYMORE… When you were able to reflect a lot of things moment to moment on it, is a big issue. It didn’t create many problems with SSZ, but it was very annoying. I did mention this to Kickstarter and I suspect they are working on a way to address this while protecting the information that was historically provided to the backers before the end of the campaign and avoid scamming.
 
 
Overall
 
 
**The numbers and graphs**
 
I love numbers and graphs (you should know that by now)

- Duration of the campaign – 30 days
- Number of backers who pledged money during the campaign – 4
- Number of backers whose payment actually went through – 4
- Payment that failed – 26
- $ amount pledged – $174
- $ amount paid – $173
- $ amount that failed to be paid – $932 
- The failure ratio was incredibly low for the project. No complaints here. The nice folks at Kickstarter said it was generally 2 to 3% of the payment that were affected on average.
- Number of backers choosing “No rewards” – 18 (for $335)
- Number of countries represented by the backers – 56
- Number of countries represented by the backers with physical rewards – 25
- Number of backers with physical rewards – 631
- Number of joysticks sent – 386

Pledges for physical rewards making 41% of the money raised is nothing to scoff at.

The Kickstarter system does send you an email whenever something related to your project happens. It can be overwhelming if you don’t expect it:
 
- Number of “Kickstarter” emails received during the campaign – 6462
- Number of pledges cancelled – 238
- Number of pledges decreased – 138
- Number of pledges increased – 564
- Number of official updates during the campaign – 21
- Number of comments during the campaign – 480
 
That’s about one comment per 10 backers. The project being a ‘help us finish our project’ rather than “help us start our project”
 
- Number of direct messages during the campaign – 228
- Number of “Kickstarter” emails received after the campaign (over 7 months) – 1621
- Number of official updates after the campaign – 22
- Number of comments after the campaign – 751
- Number of direct messages after the campaign – 842
- Number of views for the Kickstarter video – 74
- On Kickstarter – 63
- External – 11
 
About 11% of the views watched the video to the end. Not bad

**REWARDS SECTION**
 
- Number of artbooks produced – 1
- Number of artbooks sent – 248
- Artbooks production costs – £3
- Number of T-shirt produced – 320
- Number of T-Shirts sent – 302
- T-shirts production costs – £2
- Number of hoodies produced – 200
- Number of hoodies sent – 103
- Hoodies production costs – £2
- Number of OST CDs produced – 1
- Number of signed OST CDs sent – 27
- OST CDs production costs – £839 / $1
- Number of art prints produced and sent – 7
- Art prints production costs – £1
- Number of 3D printed Strike Suits produced – 2
- Number of 3D printed Strike Suits sent – 0
- 3D printed Strike Suits production costs – £450 / $702 
- Total postage cost (to date) – £1
 
Because the joysticks were managed differently through Logitech,981/$6,221 all included.
 
There are still a few things to send (T-shirts mostly) and the final costs for the 3D-printed figures (and their postage) won’t be final until it is actually done,062/$26,641 for the physical rewards. That’s 15.2% of the total raised spent there. Compared to other campaigns, this seems reasonable and within what was expected.
 
I shared in the past the following graph
 
 
 
The orange marks are for consumer events (Rezzed, Pax Trailer, and a feature on Athene’s channel) and the grey marks are positive articles in some media. Of everything that was undertaken in terms of communication and marketing (and arguably, this being an indie project, there weren’t a large budget allocate to these), none had an impact comparable to the Kickstarter campaign. As I mentioned before, the website at the time wasn’t very well done and we drove all the traffic towards the Facebook page
 
But that’s an incomplete (and old) picture
 
 
 
Because the time period covered is much longer, if only to say that the release of the second game seemed to have a much stronger impact on acquiring fans than the launch of the first game. I suspect that the commitment of the studio to create more content is what created this effect, but I have no evidence of this. The Facebook promotion that was running at the same time had a role to play as well, but looking at the numbers very closely, it was marginal compared to the release of Strike Suit Infinity itself.
 
Ideally, we can’t. What I can say is that thanks to the Kick Starter campaign, the  studio is still around and that, in the end, the backers, so critical in getting the game finished and released, ultimately represent a relatively small proportion of people who are now enjoying the game.

I want information about the engines that you've used IN THE PAST YEAR. Not that older experience doesn't matter

Here's the data I need:

* Engine Name

* Platforms it will deploy to

* 2D or 3D

* Language used to develop for it

* How active is the community

* How good is the documentation

* What does it cost? Licensing options? 

* Commercial games made with the engine? 

* What does it do well? 

* What are its short falls?

* Would you recommend the engine?

For me this is great but it is also really great for any indie developer since the sound of live instruments is just amazing. At the moment I'm just trying to find said game to write an awesome score for. So I thought I would post here and see if anyone is interested. Or if you know of anyone who is looking for a professional score

In terms of game composing experience, if you're interested just post here or PM me. Here is my soundcloud page, where you can check out some of my previous work: https://soundcloud.com/jordan-gagne.

- Linq performance sucks. Nothing sucks more than Linq performance in situations where speed is of the essence.

- So does string +=. Use stringbuilder.append instead.

- Dictionaries and standard arrays are your friend.

- Make your own random class and make the maximum value inclusive. This will save you so much time when programming and reading code.

- For heaven’s sake

**(General stuff)**

- Telling your friends and family about the game you’re making does not demotivate you ([as seems to be the general consensus](http://www.2knowmyself.com/why_you_should_keep_your_goals_to_yourself)). Instead

- Read as much as you can about techniques, you will teach your brain to think differently about your own stuff.

- You may have experience with the language

- ~~8gb of ram is actually... not that much.~~ People are having issues with this statement so I removed it. All I meant is, etc) you're gonna have a bad time.

- Keep a notebook handy. Jot down whatever comes to mind when it does. Especially helpful if you travel by bus a lot

- There’s so many ways you can do things; don’t be afraid to try it your own way.

- Git (or any other version control) is your best friend. 

- If you’re not backing up your code on some remote location you’re gonna have a bad time.

- Split and re-use. It’s easier to traverse through a couple of methods and fixing once than it is to read through a 1000 lines and then fixing the same piece of code wherever it occurs.

- Don’t be afraid to ask. /r/gamedev is amazing.

I think knowing what percentage of consoles on the market are owned by devs compared to that of units owned by consumers would help explain some of these numbers. As it's likely there are a lot of indie devs who own the Ouya

[Here](http://indiestatik.com/2013/07/22/ouya-stats/) is some additional info on sales though it's a few days old.

I'm curious as to everyone's thoughts on why the margin between downloads to sales is so large. Is it due to poor price points on the Ouya market

Also

Edit: doomedbunnies has made the point that the term attach rate is not correct for the figure given in the statement by Julie. The statistic is more likely referencing a conversion rate. Though how exactly Ouya is calculating that marketing figure is still unknown.

Edit 2: doomedbunnies amended his initial statement the term attach rate in this instance is not the same as the traditional use of attach rate.

1368634355.0,1ee0xs,The mundane side of game development,x70x,289,37,100,"Hey everyone. I put together a [post today on my website](http://randomseedgames.com/blog/2013/5/15/lacuna-passage-devlog-13-the-mundane-side-of-game-development) for a topic that doesn't get a lot of discussion. Basically

-----------------------------------

I really struggled to come up with a topic for a devlog this week. I feared that I might have to skip a week for the first time since I started writing devlogs for Lacuna Passage. Despite lots of game-related work that I had been doing I didn’t think that any of it was interesting enough to show off. A few people suggested

**Managing a Team**

The sad fact of team development is that someone inevitably has to spend time “managing” the team which detracts from the amount of time they can spend actually developing the game. This means finding reference images for concept artists and modelers, and documenting art pipeline specifics. Believe it or not, team management requires more than just poking your head into a room and telling someone to “tighten up the graphics on level 3”.

Google Drive is a lifesaver when it comes to communicating with your team. There is no better way that I have found to share and collaborate on important documents. All of our story and art pipeline documentation is shared via Google Drive.

Another great tool for team management is [Trello](http://www.trello.com). If you haven’t heard of it I highly suggest you check it out. It is essentially an advanced to-do list. You can assign team members to tasks, and leave comments and feedback. It’s seriously great. Even if you work alone it is perfect for keeping yourself on task.

**Managing Assets**

When I tell people I make video games in my free time I highly doubt they picture me spending 4 hours on a Saturday night converting image formats and adding new filename prefixes. But that’s exactly what happens more often than many developers would care to admit.

The allure of quickly throwing assets into your game “just to see how they look” can be strong, and SeriouslyThisIsTheFinalBigAwesomeRock_07_morenew will turn your folder structure into a wasteland of assets that have you scratching your head. Sometimes I wonder what the ratio of asset production to asset management is, but I know it’s much higher than most people think (or at least it should be). I spend a lot of time ensuring that there are backups of all our files and that all those files are properly labeled according to our naming conventions (which are conveniently available for reference in a Google doc).

When an asset is finally imported into the game I make sure that it has been properly checked for quality and conforms to our import settings for scale

This process of keeping your game assets properly organized can be tedious and extremely repetitive

**Bug-hunting**

I’m not sure if I can even conceive of a more annoying aspect of game development. If someone asked me how I spent last Friday evening this would be how the conversation would go:

“Hey Tyler

“Oh

Absolutely infuriating. Though I suppose I should mention that I am not a trained programmer and everything I do in code is extremely amatuer (I mostly work in Playmaker)

**Promotion**

Email, YouTube, Reddit, Screenshot Saturdays, press kits, Indie DB, and yes - Devlogs. I actually really enjoy promoting Lacuna Passage. It’s great to see people’s reactions to all your hard work, even if you have the greatest game in the world it doesn’t really matter if no one knows it exists.

Just last week I spent nearly three days putting together a [press kit](http://lacunapassage.com/press/sheet.php?p=lacuna_passage) for the game so that we have an easy place for journalists to find the latest info. That’s three days that I would love to have back for improving the game

After a full day of work at my 9-5 job I come home to manage team assignments, do some quick rounds of promotion, and maybe - just maybe - I will have time to get some real development done. All of this I do without the promise of any pay or reward, because there isn’t anything I would rather be doing. I make games and this is what it takes.

My background is in filmmaking &amp; vfx

So my big questions are: Where do you find the audience for a game like this? How do you try to connect with them

Here's where I'm at

----
- The game's in alpha &amp; being playtested. I'm guessing 4-6 months before it's finished. (That's padded since I've never done this before.)

- Windows / Mac / Linux with no plans for mobile or other platforms.

- A trailer will be ready in 2-3 weeks. I think I can cut a mean trailer

- Last week I created an [indiedb profile

- Game sites / forums / youtube channels? Which ones should I be paying attention to? Which ones are interested in games like mine? This is where I feel the most unplugged.

- Contests? GDC? I've never been to any before. I believe FRONTIERS is a quality game

- Kickstarter? Posts like [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/185z1j/my_kickstarter_is_struggling_why/) and [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/183e50/going_down_with_this_ship_my_kickstarter/) are helpful but I have no clue if my audience is big enough to support a campaign. I'm *really* eager to hear your opinions

- Steam Greenlight seems like a great fit for publishing but I'd like to hear your opinions on this as well.

""But, fellow industry peons who got left. The ladies and gentlemen who work 60, 70, 80+ hours a week for less than market pay of what they are really worth. When speaking at local colleges, conventions, and social networking events there are three questions I force those wanting to get into the industry to ask themselves.

    “Am I alright with no job security? Am I alright with being underpaid to work more hours? Am I alright with having to relocate?”.

If you answered yes to all three of those questions than you will have to deal with your decision. We all got seduced by the “glory” industry we love

The companies hold all the power. We accept these conditions blindly because we get to make games, most of use agree to not work on our own games while working for a company. Yes, think about it, we agree to not do what we went to school for, trained for, dreamed of doing because…why?

**Note:** Of you're interested in checking out other things people have asked for in the past (most of which have been put off due to time constraints), just so I can gauge interest.

**Update:**  Here are the most popular suggestions so far:

* Redesign the site
* More opportunities for users to participate (contests
* More fine-grained categories (I think the best way to do this would be to allow user-created collections to be ""promoted"" to categories
* More art.  :)
* Better organization of art content (this will require someone to spend time every week manually organizing content as it comes in)
* Open source all of the OGA source code
* Let game developers submit their games, and when you click on a game, you can see a description and screenshots, and all the art being used in it.
* Have a system to make it easier to relate and remix existing art.

**Update #2:**  Some reward ideas (looking for more input):

* The usual swag (t-shirts, etc)
* Donor gets to choose an art commission (this would have to be within certain parameters
* Name a character in a game (I'd have to get a game developer to agree to this)

Okay guys

As you all know

Yes

You will no doubt be surprised by this (I know we are), that's what I'd like to discuss here, as Valve have some very clear ideas about what they require from us, but they have also stated that they will be flexible and accept certain things that we propose relating to the product and the GMC. They do value the client/product interaction that we have here after all.

So what are they proposing for us here? Basically that the GMC become a part of the Steam Community and that we port the forums over to their format. this means that they will probably want to strip out all the creation forums, Mac and Linux. They are still debating about the Tutorials forums as we think they at least should be kept, but the general ""standard"" is not what they think it should be so I suspect that they too will be going, and Education will probably be expanded, with the emphasis being placed on student offers and events.

As for the staff, but this will depend on independent communication with Valve. I'll be putting them in touch with each of you). Unfortunately the moderators will not maintain their position, but we at YoYo Games would like to thank you all and will be supplying you with a copy of GMS Master Edition free of charge.

We have done all the regular: Homepage, Facebook, Twitter, Forum posts, IndieDB... We have gotten some good response from people who have tried out the game, but I guess it is just too average of a game.

Are the news outlets avoiding Kickstarter projects because the market is so over saturated?

* there are so many icons that it's hard to browse them
* there only available in a 400px PNG format

So I send a quick email to Lorc

I started to organize the graphics in folders but quickly figured out that it may be stupid to just let them hidden on my hard drive. They need to be easily accessible on the web in SVG.

Continuing from the recent success of my previous post on dungeon generation (**[Procedural Dungeon Generation Explained](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1dlwc4/procedural_dungeon_generation_algorithm_explained/)**) I decided that I will post more game development articles and videos in the future to inspire the community and also hopefully promote my game [TinyKeep](http://tinykeep.com) as well!

This is the first of the multi-part series of updates about TinyKeep's AI

I've posted a detailed **[YouTube video of the Roaming and Chasing behaviour](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAxfnFRB1Dg)**

In a nutshell

1 . A connected waypoint graph is calculated for a new procedurally generated dungeon. Generally we will have one waypoint per room (though some larger rooms may contain 2 or 3)

2 . By default a monster will be in non-alert (roam/patrol) mode

3 . The monster has a FOV of 90 degrees

4 . Once an enemy is detected

5 . If the enemy escapes line of sight

This is the most important part of the AI, by leaving behind the trail to follow.

6 . Trails decay over time (smells disappear), looks around for a bit, decides that he has lost the enemy and goes back to the patrol routine.

7 . All the while - a handful of rays are cast (about 6) around the monster to detect nearby walls. If it exceeds a certain distance the monster is repelled from the wall using the Separate Steering Behaviour. This pretty much guarantees that monsters won't get stuck on walls


That's pretty much it!


You can have a play yourself on the interactive demo shown on the video:

1351257918.0,124ejo,What I Learned During the Development of MatchCraft (Unity3D &amp; Free to Play),jafarykos,275,54,105,"Today I am releasing my first indie game, unlocks new elemental spells and earns coins to buy magical items.

* [Screenshot - iPad and iPhone](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mbandiKkbx1r4rcu5o1_1280.png)


What did I learn during the development of my first game? What went right? What went wrong and what I do I wish I'd have known before I started? My first source control check-in was over a year ago

.

*What Went Right*

***


1. **I finished a game** -  I started with a simple game concept (one that's probably been done to death) and put my own spin on it. I did this because I wanted to learn Unity and felt a simple game concept would allow me to focus on learning the tools. Knowing that I stuck with it and finished a game is something that makes me proud.

2. **I hired an artist** - I'm decent in PhotoShop but I'm no artist. I knew that if I wanted something polished and professional looking I would need to hire someone. At the very beginning I knew that I wanted Warcraft 3 / WoW style icons for the game. I contacted people from Deviant Art, but what he actually made was much better than I had imagined. [Screenshot - Icons](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mbandiKkbx1r4rcu5o2_1280.png) 

    In the end, store) myself to save costs. Check out [Anton's site here] (http://antonmagdalina.carbonmade.com/)

3. **I didn't write my own tools
    * EZ Gui / SpriteManager 2 - $400 - 2D Sprites - Would buy something else
    * GlyphDesigner - $30 - Fonts - Would buy again
    * TimelineFX - $50 - Bitmapped Particle Effects - Would buy again
    * Prime31 Assets - $Various - StoreKit

4. **I used the Unity WebPlayer for feedback** - I was able to send out builds of my game to friends and family using the Unity WebPlayer. The feedback I got during this process was helpful.

5. **I used source control** - I recall one occasion where my Unity project file became corrupted and none of the scene files worked. It would have been a nightmare to rebuild the scenes from scratch

6. **I got an office outside my home** - This is a success/failure wrapped up into one point. I find it very difficult to focus on work when at home. I work better in the afternoon/evenings and my work schedule shifted to 11am-7pm. I got so much more done when I got in my car

    The reason this is also a failure is that I ended my lease on the office space when I thought I was near completion (several months ago). This was before I discovered performance issues and started the iPhone UI. I should have stayed in the office until I shipped. The current plan is to get another out-of-the-house office as soon as possible.

7. **Checking off to-do lists** - I think one sign of a good developer is the ability to see the software problem from a few miles up. A good developer can look at one chunk of code and think through how changing it will affect something else. Having this ""mile high"" look at the game laid out in front of me also caused analysis paralysis at times. There were times where I realized just how much work was left to do and it was very difficult to figure out what elephant to eat. Making a to-do list of tasks helped because it allowed me to stop looking at the big picture and only look at what was next on the list. When overloaded mentally

8. **Versioned Game Save** - Honestly, I could forget to update that number.. Perhaps I should figure out how to tie the version # to an auto generated build #. Bah.

.

*What Went Wrong*

***

1. **I made too many screens and themed UIs** - I would wager that I spent over 60% of my time creating and implementing the UI. I thought I would be clever and make themed skins for my game: Earth, Water. I did this, and they look beautiful, but I should have never done it. I spent way too much time doing art and not enough time creating products that could earn my business money. I avoided the trappings of creating my own tools but I fell into the comfort of designing UI (it's what I am paid professionally to do). You are your own worst enemy when it comes to time management. All of my games in the future will have two screens: the main menu and the game. 

    [Screenshot - Fire &amp; Earth](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mbandiKkbx1r4rcu5o3_1280.png) | [Screenshot - Wind &amp; Water](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mbandiKkbx1r4rcu5o4_1280.png)

2. **I created iPhone and iPad Versions** - Ever wonder why Angry birds was only on iPhone for so long? I don't any more! I wanted to showcase the artwork by making two different versions

3. **I didn't test early enough on the iPad 1** - I have no good explanation for this. I tested my iPad code on the iPad 3

4. **I thought I could do sound myself** - I did the sound myself, buying audio and editing it for my game. I spent about $400 on audio, primarily because I had to throw away a lot of sounds that I thought were good but sounded annoying after they were in my game. I finally found a great website that let you download preview tracks and it saved so much money: [Pond5.com](http://www.Pond5.com)

5. **My UI is not flexible** - My process for UI was generally: Create something in PhotoShop

6. **I didn't implement a 'Free Code' system** - My game is free to play but has in app purchases. I wish I would have implemented a way for me to give away product keys that unlocked portions of the game or gave away IAP so I could send out fully unlocked versions to review sites or give to friends.

7. **Analytics were an afterthought** - Analytics should have been inserted early during development. Simply adding event logging after the fact will not give me actionable information. Also

.

*Freemium - aka - I hope I make money*

***
I had planned on MatchCraft being a $0.99 game

* The sheer number of free downloads dwarfs paid apps. I have a wallpaper app that earns me a few dollars a day at $0.99 that got 25

* The majority of Top Grossing apps are freemium

* My teenage family members and all their friends primarily download and play free apps

* I'm just flat out curious what it would look like when compared to stats of paid apps that I have access to

When I first implemented the virtual currency ""Coins"" in my game

**Enter Stage Left:** The blog post from the indie game devs about going bankrupt with their freemium game. After reading their post I realized that I suffered from a similar issue, there were other game modes that could be unlocked for coins, but when the user didn't have enough coins to unlock it, I did what a good UI person did and disabled the buttons. WRONG!

**My Solution:**

* **All buttons are enabled at all times** - If you don't have enough coins to perform the action
* **Change the way main UI elements work based on context** - While playing
* **Add more IAP and Virtual Currency Items** - Previously all I had was the ability to spend coins on in game items that slightly improve gameplay and the IAP were packs of coins enabling you to buy those items. I expanded the IAP offerings to include Unlock All Game Modes and a Coin Doubler. I expanded the Virtual Currency offerings to allow the user to buy level advancement with coins in the game. This lets people with currency quickly unlock new spells which I'm OK with since it's Single Player only.

.

*What would you tell other developers as they start a new game?*

***
**Choose a game topic that you will be proud to make. Plan for development to take you one month and expect for it to take you three.** - I feel like I chose this match-3 style because of inertia. I had written a basic version of ""elemental bejeweled"" in Torque2D in 2007 but scrapped it when PuzzleQuest launched. 

When I decided to make games in Unity I wanted to learn my tools

It's been getting a fair bit of love on [reddit](http://reddit.com/r/ftlgame) although it isn't without it's detractors. Although I see their points



**1. Look for creative ways to simplify.**

Making a game can be pretty damn hard. Thinking creatively about how to simplify the game and mechanics makes it more likely that the game will make it to completion. Simplifying doesn't just mean making shorter levels or fewer enemies


**1b. Discrete encounters and randomness are simplifications**

FTL does give the sense of living universe with different races and pirates and whatnot but it is only a sense. What was that pirate doing before you ran into him? Nothing


**2. Make dying a part of the experience**

Losing sucks. Dying sucks. One of the biggest gripes about FTL is that it's too random and/or too hard which can lead to players dying horribly through no fault of their own. FTL has taken Dwarf Fortress' ""Dying is Fun!"" approach. Barely fighting off a Zoltan cruiser only to warp near a sun can be exasperating but can also be amusing in a ""WTF can you believe what just happened?"" kind of way.


**3. Make a game that let's players tell a story**

Partially because of (2) what is happening in FTL (and happens in other games like Dwarf Fortress) is people are telling stories about their travels. It can be fun to tell and read stories about the lone crew member trying to fend off a pirate ship

Glorious deaths and (oh shit!) moments make for good stories. Short games make stories easier to tell (although Dwarf Fortress is a good counter example). Simplification can make it easier for players to fill in their own details. One nice thing that [Flotilla](http://blendogames.com/flotilla/) does is provide a 1-2 sentence description of each encounter which enforces the sense that you are telling a story through the journey.


**4. Allow players to mod the game (it may not be as hard as you think)**

Mods for the game are already starting to pop up. You can already fly [Serenity](http://www.ftlgame.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=2525) or the [Enterprise](http://www.ftlgame.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=2652&amp;start=1) and there are sure to be many others. For a hobby game dev this can be daunting. It's hard enough just to make the $@#$@# game, etc. too ?!

No


**5. Short games with great replayability can be as epic and grand as longer games.**

You don't have to make the next Skyrim to have an epic game. You can easily play a full game of FTL in a single sitting and yet it still feels like you've had an adventure. The variability due to the random nature each run means that I can have that same feeling of adventure each time I boot it up.

I have some tips from my experience that might help drastically improve your user's experience with configuring your game.

1. Let your user actually configure the keybindings. There's a lot of games out there that have little to no configuration options for controls. I see it a lot in strategy games

2. Make sure to include options to configure the mouse. Mice with more than two or three buttons are getting more popular nowadays

3. Don't confirm rebinding, just unbind the conflicting control. It gets very tedious when you have to change 15 or 20 keybindings and you have to confirm every single one. If you're worried about users accidentally screwing up their keybindings, have a ""Reset to Default"" button. More than likely, they weren't intending to change anything, just looking to see which key does what. The few of us who actually go through this process will fix it if we screw it up, or go back to defaults and start again.

That's about it for now. If I can think of anything else

1371820475.0,1gsj06,Breaking into game design: Part 2 - build your portfolio,FamousAspect,234,41,56,"*This is post is the second in a series on how to land your first job as a game designer. You can read the first post about [how to set your career goal at this link](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1giewv/breaking_into_game_design_part_1_find_your/).*

Although I do not review as many resumes now that I'm an indie developer working on [Enhanced Wars](http://www.enhancedwars.com) as I did when I was at BioWare San Francisco

At BioWare San Francisco, one of my favorite times of the year was when the fantastic university relations team at EA would deliver the resumes of potential interns they were bringing to campus for interviews.

It was not unusual for me to review 50 resumes in one marathon session to pick out the prospects that I thought would fit a need on my team. Whether I was reviewing a stack of resumes for intern candidates or a single resume from a recruiter for a full time position, I called someone instantly because the portfolio was so good I didn't want to waste any time lest the candidate be snatched up by another studio. Sometimes the candidate already had. A high quality portfolio was the single biggest factor in landing a phone interview.

**Tangible proof**

If your professional experience is minimal or non-existant, your extra curricular activities or your summer job in a completely unrelated industry. I only care about proof of your design abilities.

It can be difficult to know what to put in a design portfolio

*You know how to finish a game and release it to the world
*You took the time to listen to your players, reviews or other feedback
*You can tell a meaningful story about how you improved your game based on player feedback

Being able to tell me that story in the initial phone interview is an instant ticket to a full team interview.

Building a proper portfolio will take months, but when it came time to start working on the game they did not deliver. Unless you have a team you truly trust, my advice is to start out by making small but completed and polished games that you can build on your own. If you don't know how to code, it's time to learn!

**Feature portfolio material**

What you build for your portfolio is [highly dependent on your mountain](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1giewv/breaking_into_game_design_part_1_find_your/). No matter what type of design job you have, then dig into Unreal Engine 3 or Hammer and release levels to the world. If you want to work on a MOBA, then get cozy with the WarCraft III or Starcraft II editor and prototype a new MOBA style gameplay mode.

No matter what your mountain is, listen to their feedback and improve your content based on feedback will you be able to land that first professional gig. And if your goal is as targeted as working on a specific game or at a specific company, if they have publicly available tools you better invest time in mastering them.

**Other portfolio material**

A designer's job is much more dynamic than simply creating levels or quests. There are a number of other documents or types of content you can create and share as part of a portfolio. Here are some suggestions based off the varied types of work I do on [Enhanced Wars](http://www.enhancedwars.com) and other projects:

*Game Treatment* - no one is going to read a 75+ page game design document when evaluating you for a position. But they will scan a 5-7 page game treatment that outlines a game

*Feature Brief* - a detailed document that explains the full implementation of a single feature for a game, you have a section explaining why this feature needs to be added to this game.

*Game balance evaluation* - much of a designer's job is tuning and balancing game variables. Pick a game and write a report evaluating balance of a particular system or economy. Take detailed notes on multiple play sessions

*UI/UX redesign* - most of my work in mobile/tablet games involves designing or evaluating UI. Designing UI is a difficult task, and propose a detailed redesign.

*System balance spreadsheet* - most of my time as a designer is spent in spreadsheets or JSON files tweaking values. If you have followed the earlier advice and built some games

*Pen &amp; Paper prototype* - many games start as simple ideas prototyped on pen &amp; paper. Although you cannot easily share the results

These are just a few examples based off my experience. If you've done your homework and spent time identifying job postings you would like to apply to

**People are busy**

The hiring managers who will be evaluating your portfolio are likely to be some of the busiest people on the game team. They will not have a lot of time to review all the materials that you have spent months or years preparing. They will probably not install your game. They will probably not read your full document. They will probably not open your spreadsheet.

If you really want to shine, whether it is a level, design document or UI flow. Talk about the process of designing the work. What were your design goals? How did you achieve them? What feedback have you gotten from players or peers and how have you reacted to that feedback?

I was excited to see the community get organized and make more games... and then I tripped over this line:
&gt; We don't need ""producers"" or ""product managers"" posting in here. You must bring a significant asset to the game concept; whether its fiction writing, source, or music.

Now, I feel a bit excluded.  There's more to it, though: the tone of the sentiment (and it's not the first time I've seen this tone applied to production) is what gets me: it's practically hostile to an entire industry discipline.  I'd like to get a discussion going and understand this viewpoint better.

So here's the things I notice in this comment:

* ""Producer"" has been given the finger-quote treatment
* Production is excluded from the list of ""assets"" brought to the team.  It is
* For teams as small as three people, art (2d and/or 3d), environment design, sound, and QA, *fiction writing* (a discipline whose value to any given project ranges from moderate to literally pointless) is an asset that gets you in the door, but production is emphatically **not**. (1)

As I said

I'll at least try to take my best stab at why this happens:

* First
* It follows,"" i.e. ""guy who gets to tell everyone what to do.""  (I'm usually ""guy ultimately responsible for everything,"" but again, the difference between that and ""guy in charge"" isn't obvious to everyone.)
* On the indie side
* So, and generally come off more like the grossly out-of-touch executive... which, admittedly, has no place on a three-man team.

So

* What value do you place on production relative to other disciplines?
* If you value production very little
* Along the same lines
* Do you consider production problematic

(1) Fiction writers: I consider your work dearly important to games for which it is a focus.  Many games

**EDIT**: Wow, bureaucracy, and other factors commonly attributed to poor management.""  This perception is significantly affected by (1) professional use of production as a way to promote people; (2) ""producer"" serving as a indie-level dumping-ground title used by ""idea guy who wants to lead project""; (3) producers treating the role as ""person in charge"" rather than ""responsible facilitator and enabler.""

I worked on a couple educational gaming projects for Best Buy's Geek Squad Summer Academy in [2011](http://youtu.be/AXXHLN6vSNg) and [2012](http://youtu.be/XJooK8Itd38). During that time I also created a few games in my spare time

The idea for Lacuna Passage came about after the successful landing of the Curiosity rover on Mars. I have always been a big fan of space exploration so I kept wondering what it would be like for the first human explorers on Mars. What might they find? What kinds of challenges would they face? I read a lot of books on the subject and ultimately decided that it would make a great video game. I have spent the last year researching, but things are looking good.

During early development I began experimenting with different resources that might help me create the terrain of Mars more accurately and eventually I came up with a process to utilize actual Mars satellite data from the [HiRISE mapping project](http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/). You can read about how it is done in our devlog ([Part 1](http://randomseedgames.com/blog/2013/2/1/lacuna-passage-devlog-1-building-mars) and [Part 2](http://randomseedgames.com/blog/2013/2/6/lacuna-passage-devlog-2-building-mars-part-2)).

Throughout development I have found the Unity Asset Store to be immensely helpful in allowing me to quickly prototype different ideas using powerful plugins which I have adapted over time to form the foundation of Lacuna Passage. I wrote [another devlog post](http://randomseedgames.com/blog/2013/4/18/devlog-9-the-power-of-unity-plugins) about all the different plugins that we have utilized.

I have been very active here on Reddit about the game, [Kotaku](http://kotaku.com/an-indie-mars-based-survival-game-inspired-by-pokemo-643977567), [Rock Paper Shotgun](http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2013/05/14/mars-topography-photography-lacuna-passage/), and many more sites.

Greenlight is a bit opaque

So here's a breakdown of the campaign with some notes along the way:

[Five hours in](http://forum.maiagame.com/download/file.php?id=92&amp;mode=view)

The Greenlight went up. Lots of twitter attention and retweets. Posted on the (800 person) facebook page

[Eight hours in](http://forum.maiagame.com/download/file.php?id=93&amp;mode=view)

Around this mark we started to get some coverage. RPS covered the trailer and also linked to a ""lets play"" that I had ""liked"" on my Youtube account. Eurogamer and VG24/7 did small articles with video embeds.

[Twenty Four hours in](http://forum.maiagame.com/download/file.php?id=94&amp;mode=view)

Around this mark the (~8000)Kickstarter backers were notified in a big update.

We got coverage from Beefjack who I offered some comments to

[Thirty hours in](http://forum.maiagame.com/download/file.php?id=95&amp;mode=view)

The (~500) Indiegogo backers got an update as did the (~2000) subscribed to our newsletter.

[Fourty eight hours in](http://forum.maiagame.com/download/file.php?id=96&amp;mode=view)

[Fifty six hours in](http://forum.maiagame.com/download/file.php?id=99&amp;mode=view)

With the campaign going well I updated my Kickstarter backers on the progress of the campaign. By posting the full stats and a bit of commentary it provided enough news to be picked up by a few outlets

**A few notes/observations/opinions:**

**When to Greenlight:**

If you are crowd funding, use up precious time and be a distraction. Secondly, if are a small developer, you risk the Greenlight falling flat (spreading your votes out too thin over time) and not getting Valves attention.

Secondly


**Genre selection:**

One other thing to note is what genre you place your game in. Amoung my selections I had ""casual""


**Coverage:**

News sites are unlikely to cover your game if you send out releases for a Greenlight. Most have a no crowdfunding/Greenlight policy unless you are very famous. For the Greenlight campaign I only sent one email to the press. I regret not sending time before hand making more of a story to give the press an angle and make it more worthy of coverage.

If you want sites to feature you: 

* Pick a slow news day
* Ensure you have a press page on your site with NEW screenshots up.
* Video content is easy to post and speaks for itself so sites are more likely to write an article around it. Make sure it's new footage!
* Stagger your release
* Like any marketing drive
* Do something else newsworthy

**Don't spam:**

As with crowdfunding

**Extract value:**

Link people to your mailing list and encourage them to favourite your page

**Cross promote:**

The indie games scene is not a zero sum game. This means that you are not in competition with other games for the attention of your potential customers. Team up and promote your project with other developers

I'll add to this as I dig out more notes from the last week!

1347770679.0,zyjne,How To Go Full-Time Indie,TrueValhalla,248,57,83,"This post sourced from my original blog post here: http://www.truevalhalla.com/blog/?p=349

---

It’s been nearly 6 months since I went full-time indie, and already a few months into the year, I set myself a goal to make a minimum wage of $18,200 online by the end of 2012. Today, I have met that goal. And it’s only September.

After announcing this achievement on my Twitter and Facebook I received several messages asking if I had any tips for aspiring developers. It’s probably not all that common to find success while starting off as a full-time indie

How To Prepare

Before you make the transition to full-time indie you need to be thoroughly prepared for what lays ahead. Make sure you ask yourself these questions:

    - What do I hope to achieve by going indie?
    - When is the best time to make the transition?
    - How risky is it?
    - What is my fall back plan?
    - Do I have a skill set that can be monetized?

Your answers to these are very important.

If you go full-time indie

Unless you’re already set for life, it’s back to the office!

I recently watched a presentation by David Edery (Triple Town, as much as you might want to. Design everything you do to result in a payoff of some kind. For example, while I very much enjoy writing posts like this, my blog is a primarily promotional tool. I simply couldn’t afford to spend the time writing this post if it didn’t help to promote my book or improve my platform.

The point is

Most importantly, and money that you can fall back on if it doesn’t work out. If you have a family to support this becomes even more critical. Optimally, you want to be prepared to survive at least a year without a steady income. Hopefully it won’t take that long for you to start making money as an indie, but you need that safeguard in place.

How To Succeed

Some people think I’ve just been lucky, not luck. These two factors are really the key elements behind any success.

As I’ve discussed previously, and it may still be a grind. No matter how much you enjoy game development it may become just as tedious as a day job. This is something you’ll have to work through.

Of course

Try identifying fields that are relevant to your work where you may not necessarily be experienced. I study a lot of different fields online to round out my skill set, so study up!

I’d also recommend making new contacts at every chance – interact with everyone you can. Not only does this generate new possibilities for you, but it is useful. Not to mention you’ll get to meet a bunch of great people in the process. To think one email sent to a single developer has led me to talks with internet giant AOL is incredible.

Finally, an online income is a volatile one and you need to be prepared for the worst. This is another reason to improve your general skill set…the more you know the more you can do.

Overall

That said, thanks for reading, and I hope this post has been useful to you!

The past 4 years I've been producing my very own experimental music. Within every piece of my music there is part of my emotion inside of it. It’s created from anger


Within the time of music making I've came to realize that I don’t want to perform my work in front of a crowd. Yet I want to establish my emotional pieces within something much more than just a music site. As a child growing up I always enjoyed raw emotion from games. Surely playing a game with an amazing story or environment also needs that musical connection. Something that brings forth the emotion of the player… Anyways I’ll stop rambling about myself and let you just listen in on some of my pieces of work.

It has single player mode vs Ai and two player mode on same device. It has music and sound effects! Hardest part by far was complicated collision logic using vectors and heavy nested if statements. For example if you hit the ball with top part of the paddle, regardless of angle it came with. That adds complexity and nice feeling of control. It also uses small particle effect when the ball collides with paddle for eye candy. The game was written in cocos2d 1.0

**Q: I am a developer and I am working on/just finished a project. Can I post about it in /r/gamedev?**

**A:** /r/gamedev is for topics that are of interest to game developers as opposed to end-users. If you want to promote your project to potential players or testers

Having said that

* Feedback Friday is a thread where you can post playable versions of your projects and give and receive feedback from fellow developers.

* Screenshot Saturday is a weekly opportunity to share info

You are highly encouraged to participate in these threads and share feedback with your peers.

/r/gamedev does welcome technical discussions and post-mortems. If you do decide to introduce your game here

* Make sure to introduce yourself briefly

* Mention past projects you've worked on

* Explain what your game is

* Tell us about the languages

* Tell us about the development process and the challenges you faced.

* Tell us how you plan on marketing your game.

**Q: I work for a company that sells Unity plugins/3D modeling software/mobile platform licenses/books

**A:** It's important that if you do promote your products on /r/gamedev

Post in Feedback Friday if possible, hear out developers' feedback, and answer questions to the best of your ability.

Again, so if promoting a product to /r/gamedev's 40,000+ subscribers is important to you, consider using Reddit's self-serve advertising system.

I just shoved a blog post online about the response and flow-on effects PAX had for me as an indie with no finished game, or anything to really gain from PAX other than exposure. You can read the blog post here if you want: http://www.manfightdragon.com/

But I mainly wanted to know if you guys had any questions about going to a really big expo with your games

edit: Here's a link directly to the post,False,,t5_2qi0a,1374906624.0,,,t3_1j54pd
1352676548.0,1316sc,"A Technical Analysis of the ""Super Mario RPG"" Game System",Javelineer,218,38,22,"**Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars** was a game released by Square in 1996. The RPG system itself is fairly simplistic: it lacks any kind of ""skills"" such as Climb

The data I used to analyze the system is, and was usually distinct by their being dialog with the enemy before/during/after combat. The main player character, Mario, was also analyzed and used to compare to the enemies and bosses.

[Figure 1 - The Data](http://i.imgur.com/QEITg.png)

Boss monsters are highlighted in yellow.

**RPG SYSTEM BASICS**

The main system has four main character components:

* **Attack**
* **Defense**
* **Magic Attack**
* **Magic Defense**

Additionally

**EXPERIENCE POINTS**

As your character defeats monsters and challenges

[Figure 2 - Experience Points Needed vs Experience Points Given](http://i.imgur.com/w16FG.png)

As you can see in Figure 2 the amount of XP needed to attain a new level stair steps up while the overall payout from defeating monsters stays essentially the same. As expected Boss monsters give slightly more XP then normal enemies. Ideally

**COMBAT - ATTACK**

A character's ""Attack Power"" is the amount of damage dealt to an enemy. Part of the damage is nullified each attack by an enemies ""Defense Power""

&gt; For example

There is a timing mechanism in the game in which if the player presses the controller button at a specific time during the attack they can increase the amount of damage dealt somewhere between 1.5-1.7x the normal rate. This amount is only a guess on my part as I don't have the exact numbers to pin a figure down.

[Figure 3 - Player Attack vs Enemy Attack](http://i.imgur.com/OLnOJ.png)

One of the hallmarks of many Japanese RPGs is the fact that the players deal much more damage then the enemies do; but in return the enemies have orders of magnitude higher Hit Points. Figure 3 compares the amount of damage a player can deal vs what the enemies and bosses can deal. Even the bosses are no match for what Mario can deliver!

You'll notice in Figure 3

[Figure 4 - Player Magic Attack vs Enemy Magic Attack](http://i.imgur.com/PvtQv.png)

Looking at the Magical Attack abilities we once again see that the players tend to have the upper hand. Interestingly the Boss enemies did reign supreme for a short while. However this can be partially explained by the fact that the first spike is right about the time a second friendly character

**COMBAT - DEFENSE**

[Figure 5 - Player Defense vs Enemy Defense](http://i.imgur.com/AygMG.png)

Defense is the amount of damage that gets absorbed *before* it reduces the Hit Points of the receiving party. It's essentially ""armor"". In figure 5 we can see the players are no match even compared to the normal-leveled enemies. The enemies, however, that monsters do come in different strengths with some holding a lot of armor while others even less then the players themselves.

[Figure 6 - Player Magic Defense vs Enemy Magic Defense](http://i.imgur.com/cdwld.png)

Figure 6 tells a slightly different tail in which the competing parties are fairly even until after mid game when both Monsters and Bosses take the lead. This can be partially explained by the fact that in the opening of the game very little magic is used and so a defense for it is not required.

**HIT POINTS**

[Figure 7 - Player Hit Points vs Enemy Hit Points](http://i.imgur.com/E9yhw.png)

This is where we see the trademark of Japanese-based RPGs. While the Player's hit points are about the same as the Monster's hit points; it's the Bosses that tend to have exponentially more HP. In Figure 7 you can see that while the player only has about 50 HP

It should be noted that the saving grace to this runaway train is that right about the same time the Boss HP exploded was the same time a secondary character, note from Figure 3 &amp; 4 that the characters can deal more damage to an enemy then they receive. 

**ATTACK VS DEFENSE**

So far I've been comparing Apples to Apples. However

[Figure 8 - Player Attack vs Monster Defense &amp; Hit Points](http://i.imgur.com/u3rF8.png)

Figure 8 describes a rather beautiful relationship between the amount of damage dealt vs the amount that can be absorbed. We see that the blue line (Player Attack) never dips below the red line (Monster Defense)

As mentioned earlier the monster's stats tend to follow a wave pattern while the player characters favor a linear progression.

[Figure 9 - Player Attack vs Boss Defense &amp; Hit Points](http://i.imgur.com/FhG8p.png)

Looking at how a player's attack rating stands against a Boss defense is once again dwarfed by the sheer scale of the Boss's Hit Point value.

**DEFENSE VS ATTACK**

[Figure 10 - Monster Attack vs Player Defense &amp; Hit Points](http://i.imgur.com/AOFEQ.png)

Turning the tables we can look at how well a player character can take damage dealt by a monster. We see similar results as in Figure 8 where the blue line never dips below the red; which would cause the monster to deal no damage to the player!

[Figure 11 - Boss Attack vs Player Defense &amp; Hit Points](http://i.imgur.com/BrmBk.png)

The results are a little more erratic when it comes to Bosses. It would seem

Please note that the results for magic attacks vs magic defenses (the player giving the attack) are

**ATTACK VS MAGIC ATTACK**

[Figure 12 - Enemy Attack vs Enemy Magic Attack](http://i.imgur.com/OgAp6.png)

Looking at the progression of the game, instead, a dip in magic attacks by normal enemies. The sudden rise in use of magic attacks by bosses can not be taken without also noticing the rise in normal attacks as well.

It would seem

**DEFENSE VS MAGIC DEFENSE**

[Figure 13 - Enemy Defense vs Enemy Magic Defense](http://i.imgur.com/Pw5zN.png)

Counter to Figure 12, there is a steep rise in magic defenses just as normal defenses take a dip. Bosses are more well-rounded and choose to increase both sets of defense.

**COINS REWARDED**

[Figure 14 - Coins Rewarded](http://i.imgur.com/eySSv.png)

Shifting gears a bit

**OVERALL STRENGTH OF PLAYERS AND MONSTERS**

[Figure 15 - Player P/T Sum vs Enemy P/T Sum](http://i.imgur.com/qjuZx.png)

When we add up the total value for both forms of Attack and both forms of Defense (or as I like to call them ""Power"" and ""Toughness"") and purposefully exclude Hit Points, though the bosses make their signature spike to the top for a bit.

[Figure 16 - Total Enemies Strength (Hit Points Omitted)](http://i.imgur.com/sii9h.png)

Figure 16 compares all of the enemies (monsters and bosses combined) in a measurement of who has more points allocated to the Attack and Defense slots. Croco

1321803800.0,mj24i,r/gamedev Pixelart Lesson 1! Basics and UI,brevr,208,28,36,"Hey all! I had a poll a few days ago wondering if anyone is interested in a pixelart course and the response was astounding! 

This course is meant for absolute beginners who want to do their own game graphics but do not know where to start. Even if you plan on hiring out your art

For this course if you have any questions or want to post your work comment in the thread below or PM me on this profile. Any other community members who are wanting to help please say so and I will put your name up here. **Judges to look out for** brevr

Now to get right into the lesson. Some things that you will need for this course are:

* Photo editing program

* Mouse or pen tablet (NO TRACKPAD)

* Patience


For programs to use
 
* Graphics Gale (Free)

* Grafx2 (Free)

* GIMP (Free last I checked)

* MS paint


A lot of these programs are pretty similar, GG, and Gimp is the square brush set. Check online for your specific program on how to get to these brushes. Once you do locate them find the size one or 1px brush. This will be your main brush for just about anything in Pixel art. Familiarize yourself with the other options, tools and setting of your program before continuing to the next step. You should look for an eye dropper tool, a select tool, a free select tool (lasso), +800% zoom, We'll get into what those mean later. To my knowledge all the programs above have all of these except MS paint and hexidecimal numbering. **Please don't PM me with questions about these programs I have only ever used them lightly. Check online for help or post in the thread below**

This tutorial is aimed right to people making games, so I am not going to tell you how it is supposed to look. You can decide between a spread out UI, with bits and pieces of info scattered around the screen, or a enclosed UI with all the information you need in one specific area. For simplicities sake we are going to go with the enclosed UI. I came up with a quick [example](http://i.imgur.com/VxW6N.png) of the template that we will be using in this lesson. All I did here was mark out what size I wanted the UI to be, as well as everything inside it. 

Now for actual Pixeling! We are going to start with the weapon icon for a space shooter example. Now, don't act like a douche. With that out of the way, lets get started. The first thing you want to do whenever you start to pixel a piece is to get a basic framework done. You want to [define the proportions](http://i.imgur.com/XgrVl.png) of what you want to make. This is a simple outline for a space ship to go with the space shooter theme. We are going to go with a laser rifle or something like that for our weapon icon. This icon will just be a detailed image of what the weapon shoots out in-game. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/1CZlU.png) is the basic outline, and take note they are all the same, but again this is just a basic idea of what you will do. I suggest that you do this as well until you grasp all the concepts of the course. 

Quickly before we move on

Once you complete your outline, and fill the entire outline with it. We then use a very deep, royal blue for the interior lining. This is something that *some* pixel artist use to stylize their pieces, I like it and it gives some good definition and detail without being too difficult. To do the interior lining, you just take the royal blue and make a ring inside the outline, leaving one pixel space between the two the whole time. Once that is done, we have to decide on where the light source is. For this simple example lets say that the laser is brighter on the edges than in the middle. Also, using more of it where it is lightest. Once that is done, then you shade in concentric circles around it. This looks terrible! It looks unrealistic

For those of you who thought, stylized colouring and dithering. These are pretty much the same thing in this [example](http://i.imgur.com/3tdKZ.png) and pretty much all pieces. You can see that instead of using a gradient, pixel artists use dithering to transition and save colours. Dithering is great if you want to give something texture as well, but not so good for things like metal which is supposed to look smooth. Some artists take it a step further and stylize their dithering making it a trademark in their pieces. In the example above if I had used a traditional checker board dither it would have looked terrible, but with the stylized dither I incorporated it into the piece and really made it mine. There are a ton of ways to dither things and one great example is [this](http://purloux.com/images/artwork/tutorials/rundown/dither2.png) gradient. You can see that using different amounts of one colour and patterning differently you can get some really amazing results. 

For our laser

Next on the list is going to be the ammo counter for the laser example. Again

Once you are done your pieces throw them back into your UI template and see how it [looks.](http://i.imgur.com/Li883.png)

These are the most basic basics of pixel art and will get you far enough to finish off that UI example for yourselves. I suggest that you use a simmilar or the same template for your UI, and colour ramps.

1339506462.0,uxv8m,My experiences of making and releasing a game.,IllHaveAGo,209,25,112,"Hey gamedev!

I love videogames, all I wanted to do when i grew up was to make videogames. So I wrote little games at home. I went to school and eventually got a masters degree in computer sience. I worked as a mainstream programmer and saved up money for my grand game making adventure. And then, a year ago, I set off to make my game.

A few days ago I launched it. It's a space combat simulator for Android. It's intended to play very much like my favorite game as a kid

Now that the dust has settled and I can look it all with a little more clarity it feels bittersweet though. A lot of the comments I got were heartwarming and uplifting but there was also the occasional horrible comment. And by horrible I mean really horrific. Like ""You're an idiot. I hope you die."" type comments. I guess I should have been ready for that (in /r/gaming especially) and not have let it get to me

There's also the economic aspect of it. I wasn't really expecting to make a lot of (or any) money

To be honest

On the technical side I actually did what most of you would consider the cardinal no-no (apart from making an MMO). I wrote my own engine. And I did it in C. The game uses a thin java wrapper which calls the game code using JNI. I also have a corresponding wrapper written in C to run the very same game code natievly in linux on my desktop (without emulation), which the game then parses when the mission loads.

All in all it's been a good year. I wont miss working from home with no people but family around though. For the first few months I felt more and more claustrophobic

I'll probably keep making games

Anyway

Oh and btw: If you happen to have any good tips for jobs in Stockholm which you think might suit me

In a landscape including free-to-play, Ouya, Kickstarter, Desura, alpha funding, etc, there are more ways than ever to release a game and continually improve it. And there are cases, which show it is possible to grow your audience through strong game design. But by and large game development is a career of passion

Since my team [Quarter Spiral](http://quarterspiral.com) has been self-funded for the past year, but here are some thoughts on how to identify if it is time to move on.

**Engagement before monetization**

Many times people ask me to look at their game because they have a monetization problem. For an initial evaluation I both play the game and probe the dev with some questions about the game’s metrics. The dev may think he just needs more users

In free-to-play, in general the first few updates for your game are spent fixing unexpected bugs, difficulty spikes in the early game, or other factors to improve the number of returning players.

If you have low engagement numbers despite a number of updates to improve them

**Burn rate vs revenue**

Each developer’s economics are different. Metrics that represent a windfall profit for a solo developer working with contractors will get a team of 14 devs sunset at a large studio. If your burn rate (average monthly expenses) is greater than your monthly revenue

If you feel that you’ve more or less optimized your engagement rate then you can work to improve existing features or introduce new features that boost revenue. But in many cases these optimizations will be just that – optimizations. Silver bullets that dramatically change your game’s finances happen

If you’ve never done the exercise, you can use my [interactive forecast calculator](https://apps.facebook.com/forecastquest/) to do the rough math.

Evaluating your burn rate vs revenue sounds like a no brainer

**Paid advertising can’t save you**

More than once I’ve talked to a game developer with revenue losing metrics considering a paid advertising campaign to attract new users and turn their game around. When this happens, ballpark the acquisition cost per player and show them how much money they are likely to lose on advertising.

If you are an average game dev and not a player acquisition targeting expert, it is best for you to spend that money on the next game.

**Quitting is hard**

If you are driven enough to see a game through to ship, quitting your free-to-play game may be the best decision for you. It is hard to be objective, ignore your emotional attachment to a game and admit that it is just not working, but quitting something broken is the only way you will find yourself working on the right game.",,False,,False,t3_1jcjh1

I freaking love old games. I have an [arcade in my house](http://barrysarcade.com). So

Last week, they got a vintage style [video game flyer](http://i.imgur.com/jfgEp.jpg) that directed them to a URL for the game. 

The game doesn't actually have specific information about our wedding

The game is a NES-style platformer, and a few other wedding inspired levels. The main villain of the game is an emotionless robot with a circular saw blade for an arm. The smaller bad guys are various hors d'oeuvres that we hate: Shrimp, Deviled Eggs and Broccoli. Our yellow lab, Olive, serves as a guide. 

This concept for this game kind of built over time. In the beginning, using what little I knew of FlashPunk. When that was done, one level didn't seem like enough...it was too short. So, I built a few more levels, and realized the game needed some sort of story. I realized pretty early that this project had gotten out of control, and instead of dialing down the scope (which is my typical reaction), I just went for it. I created... and created

I'm wondering how much interest there is in a graphics specific community. Help, C#, Java, DirectX, OpenGL, etc. *No engines like Unity or UDK* (unless they're coding engines like OGRE perhaps?).

The reason I ask is because I have experience as a webmaster and, NeHe and all that are great, but do you really understand what a modelview projection matrix is and what it does?).

I also want to know what you guys think should be included in the website (galleries, discussion boards are obvious ones but what else?). Everything would be community oriented. You can post questions and answers, tutorials and snippets all of which could be 'featured/sponsored' on the frontpage. I was also thinking of some type of reward system for posting content and also a way of differentiating between 'expert' members.

So what do you say reddit? Is this worth investing in? I already have a domain which is sitting dormant waiting for a project like this. I'm also open to more suggestions

So why would small and indie game developers give a damn about a new payment processor?

Well two big reasons.

First off, but people trust Amazon, probably already have their credit card information registered.  Having a trust payment choice is certainly good for conversion.

Second

That is HUGE.  Amazon.com gets an enormous number of eyeballs.  It's the 8th most visited site in the world

One of the big problems that indie and smaller developers experience is getting exposure.  This could prove to be a huge help for these people.

The store is already online



So... if you are looking for a way to monetize your game, Amazon Game Connect might be a very good fit.

**Part 3: Hungry Skeletons**

YouTube Video:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=cwRo_kM19Ek

Today I'm going to talk about some behaviours that are specific to the Skeleton monster. The idea is that while Skeletons are not chasing or pursuing the player, consumed corpses turn into more undead Skeletons! We build upon all of the behaviours discussed in the previous articles to do this.

The procedure is as follows:

1 .The Skeleton is in non-alert mode (character is not in line of sight

2 . If a player is detected

3 . When the Skeleton reaches the corpse, this is to give the impression that the Skeletons are busy eating to notice much else. Also, it is still in non-alert mode and will not smell any breadcrumbs. This opens up gameplay opportunities such as sneaking around a group of Skeletons who are busy munching!

4 . When the eaten variable exceeds a certain amount (ie. 200) the corpse is completely consumed. At this point some corpses (such as Orc corpses) turn into more Skeletons! This has the effect of a large cluster of corpses quickly propagating into multiple Skeletons

5 . At that's it

This was really hard and interesting

**1) Make great game and prepare great marketing**
You need to spend on marketing as many time as you spend on development. Bad app can be pulled to top by great marketing

**2) Test your gameplay**
But game must be great not just for you — because what you make is already great

**3) Catch all bugs** 
Test game on different devices and firmwares. The worst thing you can have is a great game with bad review, so people will tell your about bugs not by App Store reviews, but on your support page.

And if you miss some bug — use [expedited review](https://developer.apple.com/appstore/contact/appreviewteam/index.html). You can use it once a year

**4) Don't make lite version**
It's boring and player will have to pass through same levels in full version if he buy it. But you need free version for players who would like to try your game! So make something special — we call it Gemibears Mini. It's free prequel for Gemibears, because you don't cut anything from the game — you add something new to it.

Remember that your paid and free (not light!) versions — are separate products. Free will help you with promotion of paid

**5) Cross promo and ad**
Make cross promo with other cool games. Gemibears have promo screens, or even travel to another city for meeting with their developers. Because support from other great games will give you lot of downloads.

Connect all your previous games by some cross-promo module. You can make in house solution or use something like chartboost — but 3rd party solutions are not flexible at all.

Use paid ad — but use it carefully. Buy iOS ad ONLY. No web, EA or Zynga games using [Burstly](http://www.burstly.com/), but be careful planning your budget. 

**6) Make something that will generate new users from inside of your game**
We have twitter community in Gemibears and Facebook connect in Gemibears Mini. Both give an option to attract new players

**7) Make all marketing efforts in one day**
Don't spread it for month or even week. We release Gemibears few days before all marketing and have no downloads at all. But after using all marketing that we prepare in just 3 days — top 25 occupied!

**8) Icon
You need a genius icon. Most of people make decision about buying or not your game just by looking at it icon. We make about 26 different variants of Gemibears icon before we considered it good enough. Great

Other really important part — App Store screenshots. Actually, but ""match-2"" — this is truly unique!   

[Official trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Akd-n9IgHGg). If you don't make it — some youtube teen will record video from shaking hands and all people will see the game as it looks at this video.

**9) After release buzz**
Don't underestimate any additional free buzz that you can make. Register your game in [Facebook App Center](https://www.facebook.com/appcenter/) if you have any fb functionality. Submit your icon (it's must be great

Don't expect Apple feature on App Store. You can't control featuring process

Don't expect Press will admire your game for first time, not before it.

But you have to write to everyone. Make not just text letter, send a latter again and — it works!

1347888472.0,100rl5,If you've ever want to proceduraly generate a texture on an arbitrarily perturbed sphere I have some helpful information for you,,197,37,49,"This is a problem I've been stuck for a good week or so on.  I finally got a result I'm happy with

Basically, etc, etc, in order to make the landscape interesting without needing some 4096x4096 monster texture which is pre-rendered for the entire landscape.  Inside a sphere, this gets a lot harder, because there's no obvious way to seamlessly repeat rectangles around a sphere.

1. [The naive approach](http://i.imgur.com/dkGuY.jpg)

I generated rectangles based upon latitude and longitude.  Half the problem here is that I forgot to make my textures seamless.  The bigger problem is that you end up with uneven texture stretching, especially along the poles.  Also, a nasty seam which is a pain to get rid of.

2.  [Texture every small triangle individually without worrying about seems](http://imgur.com/a/SnzSA)

You get some prettier results this way in general.  You never get stretched texture because each triangle is given UV coordinates separately with exact sizing based upon that triangle.  Not too bad, the individual triangles are all very distinct because their edges do not match up.

3.  [A play on cube-mapping inspired by an NVIDIA article](http://i.imgur.com/BdjXP.jpg)

Finally!  You don't get any obvious texture stretching

The only issue here is that the individual texture repetitions are pretty obvious.  Once I sub out my current sample textures for some larger samples (and turn down my UV multiplier) this will look near perfect.


So for those of you who want to do something like this
Cube-map the sphere.  For a vertices off to the left (large -X), you generate the texture coordinate as VertexPosition.YZ * MyUVRepeatingMultiplier.

For textures towards the top, for front and back you use VertexPosition.XY instead.

This doesn't look too bad
1.  You get seams at the transition points between ""faces"" of the cube.
2.  The texture is all stretched out on highly vertical faces.  For example, when the steepness towards the center means VertexPosition.XY might be a better choice of coordinate.



How to solve the seams:
Rather than choose ONE coordinate based upon which plane the vertex is closest too, and blend together.  So you end up saying

TextureColor = Texture.sample(VertexPosition.XZ) * abs(VertexPosition.Y) + Texture.sample(VertexPosition.YZ) * abs(VertexPosition.X) + Texture.sample(VertexPosition.XY) * abs(VertexPosition.Z) / (Total of X + Y + Z)


All of a sudden everything looks a really good
Rather than using ""abs(VertexPosition.X/Y/Z)"" as your blending factor, rather which plane its triangles lie closest to angularly.  Now flat surfaces off to the left are correctly weighted towards the YZ plane, while steep surfaces off to the left are more accurately weighted words the XZ or XY plane.


The one downside to this approach, if you are blending two samples together based upon altitude at each point, you are doing 6 texture samples per pixel rendered.  On other hand, my 2 year old laptop which was pretty cheap at the time can render this full-screen at 200 fps, so it's likely an ok thing to do unless you are targeting old Intel graphics chips.




EDIT:  If the triangles in your sphere have per-face normals rather than smoothed per-vertex normals,False,,t5_2qi0a,1347897374.0,,,t3_100rl5

Whenever I take a concept or a game asset to him, so I often have to do and redo the same piece from scratch several times making random changes in the hopes that I will hit the mark at some point. My friend also does programming (like my boss) but is currently a student with people under him working on a game. He has to manage these people on a much larger scale project and despite having the artistic talent of a 10 year old (his words, not mine) he is able to perfectly express exactly what he is looking for in every piece and his artists are able to hit the nail on the head every time because of this.

To make matters worse, he will say that it doesn't fit properly and demands that I redo it. (I've had this happen with one particular asset several times where he will tell me to revert a change that he made me make to an already finalized asset only to tell me to revert it again the next day.)

Another thing I've noticed is that if he is employing some sort of project management, he is expecting 3 separate games (albeit clones of the company's most recent game) to be made within **two weeks**, all with different visuals. Every day I have to make up to 6 finalized, *highly detailed* assets (see below for an example) within the 9 hour day, which I then have to take home and end up working on another 5 hours until midnight before I have to crash in time to be up for work again in the morning; and they still get rejected. There are no concepts for these pieces either, I'm working with nothing and he doesn't even want to see anything but a completed piece. I'm called lazy if I do a simple sketch to get a feel for what he's looking for or told that it needs color for him to decide so if I'm asked to make an asset, I have to to it start to finish before he ever even sees it.

We're working on mobile games as well and yet he constantly nitpicks about small details that wouldn't even be seen if they took up the entire phone screen

Here is an example of 2 of the 8 assets I have to do today which is *still* not approved. Again this is for a mobile phone game so actual viewing size would be between 3/4""-1"" and I am not under any NDA.

Hope you find it useful.  I tried to list all of the engines in most common use, as there are literally hundreds of engines out there in a semi-finished state.  As to the game examples, they were chosen pretty much at random by me.  Engines are listed in alphabetic order, and the list is submitted without bias ( at least, that is the intention ).

If you think another engine should be included on the list, I don't really want to fill it with cruft.

I made a couple questionable decisions.  I am not sure if the C4 Engine should or shouldn't be included; it is seemingly popular

I was also unable to discern the current status of the Gamebryo engine, please confirm if you know.

The same holds true for iDTech 4; with iD's purchase by Zenimax, but I need to confirm if you can create a commercial game using it.

Finally, well... I really like the Nebula device and well... a list of 19 doesn't sound as good! :)  It is rather outdated and unsupported, although products have been shipped using it, rather recently even, and full sourcecode is available.

I opted not to include Crystal Space; although it has been around forever and seems to have potential, the Build Engine, LithTech, etc.

Oh and for some stupid reason, the fonts can look a bit... off in Chrome.  Hopefully I will find the cause soon enough.

Hope some of you find it useful!  I have a similar engine in the works for 2D engines as well.

My name is Adrian, to help promote their work through social media. My main focus is on YouTube, but I also use the power of FB, Twitter, reddit, etc. I've been posting on this subreddit for a little while now and some of you might remember me.

The reason I started the channel was because I noticed that there are Let's Players out there that play indie games and even do requests

&gt; Here are some examples of games I've featured:  
* Terminally Ill by Sebastian Lague: http://youtu.be/o0mSp53h88s  
* Mystic Crusade by For Better or for Worse Games: http://youtu.be/YoqBZojbMDQ  
* Kingsport Cases by Machines in Motion: http://youtu.be/RFgEMBjnFoc  
* Delver by Priority Interrupt: http://youtu.be/BqwVGXtUXds  

A lot of the time I like to discuss information about the game and the developer while I play your game. So the easiest way for me to have everything is to submit your game to me through this form here: http://www.indiegamefarm.com/submit-your-game/

That site is one Weasel of [WeaselZone](http://www.youtube.com/user/WeaselZone) and I created to host our videos from our channels and to make it easier for submissions of developer's games. The form may look intimidating

I've seen some very interesting stuff on here and would love to continue featuring your games for the world to see. My channel is growing fast and I have a lot of plans for you guys in the coming months.

Can't wait to see what you guys have in store.

Take care and stay indie

Originally I posted this to /r/PixelArt

This is meant to be a look through of the GameBoy Advance game ""Final Fantasy Tactics: Advance"", let us get started.

Let's start with the main concept behind all art:

**Color &amp; Light**


The game uses a style of saturated darks &gt; pastel mediums &gt; unsaturated lights

&gt;[Scene 1](http://i.imgur.com/WS4DitF.png)

As you can see by the picture above, to purple, with minor white and green influences. (the snow and the sidewalks)

These other influences are hardly noticeable though, in a way, absorb the colors that are around them. These can be considered almost free colors, colors you can throw in your theme that will look good anywhere due to their absorbing nature.

As you will notice throughout this post, as the texture it forms is very eye catching, and too much can just create unnecessary clutter.

&gt;[Scene 2](http://i.imgur.com/RqlOkf6.png)

In this picture you can see that the overall theme of the level is yellow, with some minor greens. (The doors and windows - everything adds to the theme.)

As is good with almost any shadow or light

If you look on the sides of the dirt tiles in the bottom left and middle left

If you will also note, it is not confused with things which the player can interact with.

Notice the white cloth as well, but one thing to always remember: 

**Perfect greyscales will ALWAYS be boring to look at.**

And as well as just being plain boring, as the cloth gets darker, it dips closer to a brown color, with some purple-blue in the middle to account for the previously mention blue tint on shadows.

&gt;[Scene 2: Night](http://i.imgur.com/uEPbY1y.png)

This is the same scene as before, you can see how much of a difference light has on the overall color of a theme. The theme of this level has been changed from Yellow&gt;Brown&gt;White to Blue&gt;Green&gt;Purple.

This has been done by changing the cloth to purple
purple-ish blue color. And really, even hot feeling area, is now a cool, mysterious area. Color choice means everything, and generally cool (as in temperature), mysterious, or evil are what night time represents.

Also worth noting is that anytime scenery from closer to the screen would overlap scenery far away, adds depth and supports the illusion of a 3D world.

&gt;[Scene 3](http://i.imgur.com/GRjsMSw.png)

This levels theme is Blue&gt;grey&gt;purple

If you look closely, and greens were outlined with a dark purple rather than a dark green. Doing this keeps synergy between the colors even when they may seem far apart.

Add on to that note of synergy, once again going with the theme of never, ever, using flat greyscales. If you brought up the palette for the concrete tiles used on this level, it would look brown. However, the apparent grey illusion is kept by simply using more of the unsaturated colors and using very sparingly the dark, saturated browns in the palette. This is **very good**


**Characters**


If you look back on the characters in the scenes we just went over

1. Character palettes do not reflect their surroundings.

2. Regardless of the brightness/darkness of the area

3. All characters are outlined with thin

4. Characters are more saturated than their surroundings.

What this does is, it is easy on the eyes. Outlines tell you where things are, and they also make sure you know where the things you care about are.

&gt;[Character Sheet](http://i.imgur.com/QB8RrWF.png)

Notice the anatomy of the characters

1. Every single character looks like this. It looks a lot more reasonable when every single character is based off of the same anatomy.

2. It is easier to represent a character in such a small sprite when they are holding their limbs further from their body.

3. The body is stretched a small amount to give the illusion that the limbs aren't being held out oddly

This is an incredibly intelligent decision; they have more room to work with, the anatomy is kind of like an egg with a head.


**Interface**


This has more to do with design rather than art

&gt;[Example](http://i.imgur.com/Y7cbGyi.png)

The font used in the menus is the same font that is used in dialogue

Notice how there are also bubble letter versions of the base font. This font is used primarily for important things

Also notice how the HP


**Portraits**


&gt;[Example](http://i.imgur.com/MRBYoY9.png)

As you no doubt noticed, really, any other part of the game. This is done in a few ways:

1. First, ranging from 6-7 hues of the same color. This makes the transition smoother, and you end up with very smooth shiny looking portraits.

2. Second, it is black; however when it outlines a lighter white, it is dark brown, and when around blue, it is dark blue. This also adds to the smoothness of the portrait.

3. Third and by no means the least important

Other than those basic uses of outline and color

One more thing worth noting about the portraits, much more important than you would think. By giving the character from a little under the shoulders and up, you can tell they are human (or at least humanoid, in this moogles case). **NEVER** give your player floating heads. Unless your character actually *is* a floating head, then I suppose it's fine.


**On Shiny Things**


The look at the game is basically done now

&gt;First off, unsaturated colors, with sudden high saturation dark spots that appear in the middle of curves with almost no gradation.

&gt;[Example](http://i.imgur.com/5lIKpjH.png)

&gt;Second, they appear more near the edge as light isn't quite as reflective on this surface.

&gt;[Example](http://i.imgur.com/jwOZi0Y.png)

&gt;Third, but instead of having dark patches in the middle of curves, they have light in the middle of curves.

&gt;[Example](http://i.imgur.com/tsjK2kr.png)


**Some Basic Color Palettes**

For those that may have a bit of trouble grasping the color theory still

1. Cyan&gt;Blue&gt;Purple&gt;White was used to represent blue objects.

2. Brown&gt;Orange&gt;Yellow&gt;White was used to represent gold objects.

3. Black&gt;Low Saturation Green&gt;Low Saturation Blue&gt;Light Pastel Blue&gt;White was used to represent grey objects in GUIs.

4. Violet&gt;Pastel Red&gt;Unsaturated Red&gt;White was used to represent red objects.

5. High Saturation Brown&gt;Low Saturation Purple&gt;Grey&gt;White was used to represent white objects.

6. Light Unsaturated Cyan&gt;Very Light

One final hint on coloring objects

Try to imagine what the properties of what you are coloring are, even in a medium as small resolution as pixel art.


**That's All!**


That about wraps it up. I'm sure there is a lot I missed, and I hope you come out of this understanding color and lighting better!

In December I mustered up the courage to put together a [Kickstarter project](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/108259147/game-of-inches). This has been more than a struggle but it is what I expected.  I am not an artist nor am I a writer or marketer. I am a programmer and it shows. I come with the same flaws that many of us programmers share including shyness. Though

My fist error was assuming people would look past my art assets and view my game though the eyes of a programmer but I was wrong (now it seems to obvious). I wanted people to see that the mechanics of my game were smooth and simple. Instead they seemed to get stuck on the horribly ugly images I had on my page and in my game. 

Before day one I had my bucket ready and now I'm trying scoop out the water that's sinking this project.

**Updates:**

1. Added [Promotion Image](http://imgur.com/a/LkHNW#6) to top of page to clarify platform availability
2. I replaced this terrible custom field sketch with a cleaner version. Now that I look back I don't know what I was thinking to have this as the first image on my page.

* I created a [press release](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=gmail&amp;attid=0.1&amp;thid=13c86c38468ff8e3&amp;mt=application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document&amp;url=https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ui%3D2%26ik%3Da595dcdabe%26view%3Datt%26th%3D13c86c38468ff8e3%26attid%3D0.1%26disp%3Dsafe%26realattid%3Df_hcj5pez20%26zw&amp;sig=AHIEtbTPhoK8VwXb-xdDDLQMkMi7FOOkTQ) and sent it to as many related gaming sites a possible. 
* I sent out requests to my personal Facebook friends
* I created a Website, Youtube, and Reddit Account dedicated to my project. 
  * Twitter - 52 followers
  * Facebook - 77 Page likes (26 are Personal Friends)
  * Youtube - 1300 Views
  * Reddit - 60 Link Karma
* I was featured on the [IGDA Kickstarter page](http://www.kickstarter.com/igda)
* After meeting some of the guys at TecmoBowl.org through [a post](http://tecmobowl.org/topic/53094-tecmo-super-bowl-like-mobile-games/) they were kind enough to post my Kickstarter on the [Tecmo Super Bowl Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/TecmoSuperBowl?fref=ts) page on Super Bowl Sunday

**Kickstarter Statistics:** 

After all this I would have hoped for a better response but here are our statistics as of today:

* [Project Overview](http://imgur.com/a/2FLTO#3) - 9% Funded
* [Graph of Progress](http://imgur.com/a/2FLTO#2) - Flat
* [Total Video Views](http://imgur.com/a/2FLTO#6) - 1
* [Traffic Breakdown](http://imgur.com/a/2FLTO#4) - Facebook $160
* [Reward Popularity](http://imgur.com/a/2FLTO#5)

Hopefully with my updates I see a change but if not I will continue scooping water over the side.

If nothing else I hope this post helps others to understand that artistic assets are not to be overlooked. Had I done a better job preparing my Kickstarter initially I believe I would have had a much more positive response. 

Edit: This post is meant to be informational but if you disagree or have criticism please share it. I have shared a lot of personal opinion in this post and may very well be wrong.

At the moment we're working on a hugely ambitious project that's coming along nicely

I can't reveal too much about the game at this stage

In terms of who we're looking for...

- Ideally you'd have very strong C++ skills with a mathematical or graphics background

- You're willing to work under and follow directions from our lead programmer. 

- You're someone who understands how to deliver

- Someone good at working in a small team of completely unprofessional

- Have time to dedicate at least 20 hours a week to game development

- Are happy to work with an emphasis on communication and planning

If this sounds like you, though not essential. 

Location isn't important as we're willing to take people on who are able to work remotely. Though availability during GMT working hours/evenings is important.

**The story behind Futile:**

I come from a background using Flash and Cocos2D, but I just wanted something simple that could be used 100% from code, like all the platforms I was used to.

So I finally bit the bullet, and it ended up working really well. It was meant to be just a personal thing, but I casually mentioned it on Twitter and a bunch of people seemed to be interested, so I decided I'd make it a bit more presentable and release it.

It does a lot of neat stuff behind the scenes

Stuff like: 

    FContainer container = new FContainer();
    container.rotation = 90;
    container.x = -50;
    FEngine.stage.AddChild(container);
    
    FSprite banana = new FSprite(""Banana.png"");
    banana.x = 10;
    banana.y = 100;
    banana.scaleX = 1.5f;
    banana.alpha = 0.5f;
    
    container.AddChild(banana);

It's still in development and basically completely undocumented

I excel in any mood of electronic, psychedelic, experimental, and industrial music.

I work in constant communication with the game developers to craft the sounds and feelings that the world of your game deserves. I will not stop changing a song around until the game developers feel it is suitable for implementation.

The whole 'omg indies can now make games hat will play on TVs!' is great and all but when you think about it objectively indie game devs have always been able to do that and its a feature most people don't really bother with.

A little back story on Glare: It was made for XBLIG and while selling a respectable amount

Glare is an expansion of my university project to dynamically change the difficulty of the game based on the users current skill level. So while it may just look like a geometry wars clone

We just update our little Unity3D plugin

Texture Tools is a plugin that enables you to tweak some aspects of your textures inside Unity. All filters/tasks run in a separate thread

**Features:**

[SWF2PNG AIR App](https://s3.amazonaws.com/Cats0/catsplugins/unity/texturetools/promo300x300/promo_swf2png.png) - Your MovieClip animations to png sequences without having to deal with messy registration points manually.

[Solidify](https://s3.amazonaws.com/Cats0/catsplugins/unity/texturetools/promo300x300/promo_solidify.png) - Removes white halos from transparent textures. Solidify fixes the fully transparent pixels of your textures so they can be displayed properly when they are sampled by the engine.

[Resize](https://s3.amazonaws.com/Cats0/catsplugins/unity/texturetools/promo300x300/promo_resize.png) - Lanczos (great for reduction)

[Filters](https://s3.amazonaws.com/Cats0/catsplugins/unity/texturetools/promo300x300/promo_filters.png)
Photo Filters - InstaRetro
HSL - Hue

[Unpack/cut sprite atlases](https://s3.amazonaws.com/Cats0/catsplugins/unity/texturetools/promo300x300/promo_cut.png) - A fast way to use sprite-sheets from Tiled to your favorite 2d sprite plugin.

[Batch Processing](https://s3.amazonaws.com/Cats0/catsplugins/unity/texturetools/promo300x300/promo_batch.png) - All texture modifiers can do multiple textures at once.

All filters can be run in-game! [Here's an example.](http://www.catsinthesky.com/plugins/examples/texturetools_runtime) This is useful for editing avatars pictures inside your game.

* Sidebar: Post stuff related to topics on game development: programming, sound, engines, music, marketing, business. Questions, discussions and advice.

* Write about your own projects

* Make sure that your questions are properly researched; if the question has already been asked in the past, explain your problem, the steps you've taken, the things you've found that led you to decide that you had to ask a question, etc.

* If you want to self-promote, kickstarter, greenlight, etc., you have to give the community something. That could be an article that you wrote on your website. It could be an experience report, a story, an explanation of how you tackled a specific problem, insightful, and we will overlook the fact that you are promoting your game or crowdfunding campaign.

* You can and should post about any compos or contests that might be going on. If you're a compo organizer, use Feedback Friday or Screenshot Saturday. For contests, post about it once, and include the rules in the post.

* This is a nice place for a game developer AMA, how your drunk aunt kicked you out of her attic, etc. 

* If you are a game related service website, an in-game ad service, etc... You get one introductory post for your service or website. After that, you can pay for reddit advertising and your spam can go in the little box with the other paid spam.

A few months later something bad happened, a shameless attempt to milk things by putting a missleading ""4"" into the title.

I was approached by Apress again this year. They asked me to update the book, and agreed to do this revision.  I put 6 months of my life into the first edition, it's a love child and something i will look back on as one of my life achievements. I couldn't just give it up. So i put another 6 months into this 2nd edition, updating outdated information, fixing errors in the code of the ""Beginning Android 4 Games"" ""edition"" (how the hell could they fuck that up? First edition was prestine), adding new things.

An here i am with a [brand new edition](http://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Android-Games-Mario-Zechner/dp/1430246774/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1354918984&amp;sr=1-2-fkmr0&amp;keywords=beginning+android+games+sec). I put a lot of blood and sweat into this one, programming experience, preferably with Java is required though. You'll develop 3 games, two 2D games, one 3D game, and you'll get to know all Android APIs relevant to game development.

If you own a previous version, and the other one is on marketing and monetization. The NDK chapter is very lightweight, it's a beginner's book after all. However, it demonstrates a real use case, and should teach you all you need to move performance critical stuff to native code.

The income generated from the book goes mostly to [libgdx](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) and its nasty set of build servers. The best way to support libgdx is by taking part in its community or even participating in its development. The second best way is to buy a copy of the book. You get something for your money.

We were both invited to beta test the next app from Rocketcat Games. Throughout 2010

I had some moderate art skills and he had decent programming experience. That's obviously the perfect equation to create a video game. In 2011, a 2D platformer for iOS, is finally available on the App Store.

We hope everybody has a lot of fun with this one!

And here's some screenshots for those of you who don't like to watch videos before you see screenshots :P : http://imgur.com/a/QAhRK

The game is like geometry wars with abilities that you can level up as you progress through the game. It will involve more strategy and has an artstyle that was heavily influenced by ghost in the shell's vision of cyberspace. Hope you guys like the progression so far.

* What platforms did you target and ship those games to?

For those who know of us, and we're coming close to the end of our Beta era. A lot of the kinks have been worked out.


For those who do not know of us, and work with other developers.

We have three main areas of focus for the site: **Connect**


* **CONNECT**

We have systems in place to **browse developers by their skillset**, musicians, sound engineers, writers, or designers.

Part of what helps us connect developers is the ability to **upload your portfolio** pieces to show your work. You can upload images, audio samples, and other multimedia formats. This helps connect developers, because frankly, who wants to bring someone into their project without knowing what they're capable of? Right now, it isn't uncommon to browse Classifieds forums like those found on tigsource, gamedev.net, anyone who has tried to go this route knows that it isn't easy to research all the candidates or find quality people. At Develteam


* **COMMUNICATE**

The site itself has some great features. We have a site-wide **Forums**, social network style **Feeds and Walls**, a growing **list of Game Dev Tools and websites with Assets**, a **Private Mail system**, **Notifications**, and more. 

Whether you're showing off your personal work

* **COLLABORATE**

Once your team has been assembled

**Game projects have a variety of tools** at their disposal, **Public and Private Forums**, a **Member Task System** to keep track of what has been and what needs to be done, and a **Private Web-Based Chatroom**. 

**Each Chatroom has features that make collaboration easy**: A White Board, and Screen Sharing... All from the browser. 


----
* **THE FUTURE**

As I mentioned

We have some ideas that we're still working on. One is a ""Brainstorming"" system. Our thought is that one user can start a topic, throwing in ideas. Sort of a Stack Overflow for creative types.


----

We'd like to see you drop by and we look forward to seeing your portfolio.

What it does do, allow people to become interested and inspired in development, and give others an option to learn how to design fun, small-scale games without focusing on the busywork and bullshit associated with a lot of game coding.

Getting good at game development, lowers initial expectations and allows them to get started right away with something that can, given time, produce something exceptional. Telling people that MMOs are written in C++ so they should start writing their network code right away otherwise it's wasted time: that's not helping anyone.

We're currently still in the planning stages

The two languages I've enjoyed coding in the most have been C# and Java, or a way to make C++ more pleasant to work with.

So:

1. Is anything else really viable for cross-platform game development?
--- I looked at Vala a little bit - it compiles down to C which sounds promising. Have any of you guys worked with it?
--- Any other suggestions?

2. Is there anything I can do to make C++ as developer-friendly as C#? Perhaps a good object-oriented framework (maybe with garbage collection) that you can suggest starting from, and perhaps something to generate the makefiles and whatnot automatically? Perhaps something that does some of the above?

 **Tips Given** (comment pull

 * Simple simple simple. Have a background in simple games prior to starting any major product
 * Finish your game
 * Don't be afraid to make a copy of game like Pacman
 * Get experience from real jobs in programming
 * Great idea's can lead to unattainable desires
 * Re-work old projects for experience purposes
 * When learning a new engine, etc) to learn the engine faster
 * Keep a blog of your work
 * Break your game into small pieces
 * Finish/polish your game before letting the feature-creep set in ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_creep )
 * Only show initial prototypes to people who know what it takes to design/code things themselves (http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/18w3ea/tips_on_first_game/c8ijukk)
 * There is always a chance for ""Version 2.0"" of your game. A game that is notoriously bad could become stupendously awesome in v2.0
 * People are awesome. People are dicks. Learn to live with both of them.
 * Feedback Fridays on /r/gamedev. ""People are awesome/dicks"" rule applies
 * Remember your sibling saving over your Save Game in &lt;var String gameName = ""Favorite Game Here""&gt;
 * Start small and simple
 * Set your features/requirements for the game early on
 * There are no shortcuts to success (well

1357475905.0,1624gh,Axis the new open source html5 game engine,g1i1ch,154,28,25,"After seeing the recent JavaScript game engine thread I remembered, this was one of the most advanced JavaScript canvas2d engines available. 

Here's a small feature list pasted from my site.

* Sprites with time based animation
* Nice camera with customizable delay and follow actor features
* Infinite layers and switching between them
* Polygon based path system
* Sphere
* Custom and simple event system
* 150+ key combinations
* Basic behavior tree AI
* Scene Management
* Dialogue tree system with 670+ customization possibilities
* Resource manager
* Html5 audio and video manager
* In game skewed or shrunk video
* Timers with chained commands
* Works on known platforms and browsers and phones(as far as I know)
* Cached and word wrapped text

My methodology when making this was to make it light and keep it out of the way. I don't want to force too many of my ideas of programming on you so I made the engine more like a series of libraries you can use as you like. 

Some of the features like the resource manager I'm very proud of,images,sounds,video) into sections and pick which sections to load when you want, it'll return the ratio of loaded vs all. You can also unload sections, though whether or not the browser will free the memory depends on the browser.

Another nice feature is the ability to make individual paths for each actor with polygons. Turning on debug will draw the paths. 

Now, debugged, and remade. Like the level system, it's a complete mess and it only supports background and foreground images. Also I'm 100% self taught so some things I do I may do weird because I figured it out myself. In my roadmap to 0.5 I have to remake levels and do tiled maps too. The Behavior tree is simple and doesn't have any premade behaviors, the collisions are simple too and leave what to do up to you while giving all info you'll need. It's not too limiting as you'll see in the Tech Demo I'll post.

The current roadmap to 0.5 includes the level remaking

It's pretty fast and powerful

Here's the repository [(repo)](https://bitbucket.org/g1i1ch/axis). About the resources folder

I apologize for the weak use of comments

Here's the tech demo, there may be some messy code here to there since was on deadline! Actually works best on IE10, weird right?!&gt;

[Apalia Tech Demo](http://iris-studios.co/demo/). LMB to move

For those with too slow computers

I have some part way finished documentation on my site

I have a small polygon path editor for those interested in using the engine

Info on the polygon editor: 
Drag your background onto the ""Back"" box to set the background, and create new nodes with RMB. The little black dot denotes the head of the polygon, new nodes will be connected to it. Hit ""Enter"" for it to open a small window with a semi formatted array for you. This is just a little basic utility I made for myself, it's made with the engine itself. Make sure to use images bigger than the screen for now, there's a bug in the level code (needs to be remade remember).

If anyone would like to help me out making this open source let me know. I've only coded with myself before and haven't run a community. Oh yeah

Enjoy

1372856152.0,1hkb88,Great melodic music is a powerful way to promote your game,mastercelo,155,33,37,"The Musical Box #20: The importance of melody

What makes game music memorable? Is it the genre, the most important aspect is melody. Every single game that was featured on The Musical Box, and probably your favorite game soundtrack as well, has strong melodies. But, what the heck is a melody?

The Set-Up

A melody is a succession of notes that are highlighted in a composition. They stand out in the context of the whole song, rhythm and even production values. The melody is the hummable part of the music and some composers consider it the most important element of a composition.

A well-crafted melody is instantly recognized by the human brain. If done correctly, and this is when the composer must use his sensibility to use melodies with wisdom.

Balance is the key

Overusing melody may indeed be a problem, every developer is trying to conquer mindshare, and music with strong melodies is an incredibly powerful tool to achieve that.

Finding a good balance between songs with strong melodies and songs that blend with the background may be the solution

The moments

See below for some examples of music that have strong

https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=GJNEmet17Ak#at=195


The impact

If music has an impact in your life, there are other factors that may be considered when we talk about Super Mario Bros., such as historical relevance and pioneering, but you may rest assured that the melody played a huge role in the popularity of the franchise.

I'm one of the devs at [Cipher Prime](http://www.cipherprime.com), [Fractal](http://store.steampowered.com/app/61310/), and [Pulse](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pulse-volume-one/id432667443?mt=8)).

We're finishing up a month long [Kickstarter for the multiplayer sequel to Auditorium, and success or failure is still up in the air. I wanted to share some of the things we've learned from the experience thus far. Maybe it will give those of you at companies in a similar position (i.e. the game developers who aren't part-time hobbyists but also aren't Tim Schafer :) ) some ideas, and please feel free to contribute in comments!

The main message: **Publicity is the hardest part of game development.** Not a novel idea, and we think our main issue is simply not getting enough eyes on the project. UPDATE: [progress to date + five hours](http://i.imgur.com/oendt.png). UPDATE 2: [Funded!](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/761471459/auditorium-2-duet) :) + [Kickstarter backend data if you're into that sort of thing](http://imgur.com/a/T4XeO).

Some of the things we've tried/wished we'd tried/learned:

* **Big game press is damned hard to get.** The largest outlet we were able to get was [Joystiq](http://www.joystiq.com/tag/auditorium-duet/), submitting news, and trying to get in contact with editors/writers was pretty much a bust. We did get a few news articles or mentions on several more well-trafficked sites, like Destructoid and Gamasutra. This is primarily about networking. If you aren't doing any, start meeting people.
* **Little game press is easy to get.** We gave Steam keys out to anyone who wanted to review the original Auditorium's rerelease, but we thought it was still important to build relationships with budding game writers/sites, and it still gets our company's name out there for search engines. You meet a bunch of cool people.
* **Aggressive comment follow-up.** if someone writes a story about us, as this sort of stuff can suck up all of your dev time, and not all comments have good answers.
* **In-house mailing list.** We have a roughly 24k person mailing list, once at the beginning of this last week, and we're planning on one more tomorrow. This helps, as the people on it are usually interested in your work in the first place. If you don't have a mailing list for your company, start one. Just don't abuse it.
* **Local name brand has helped us out a bunch.** Philly's game dev scene is really small, and even smaller news outlets are way more willing to talk and write about you. We also participate actively in our local IGDA chapter and such, and were one of the sponsors for the Global Game Jam here in Philly. The friends you make help you out big time.
* **Cross-Game promotion.** Before the Kickstarter went off
* **Regular website promotion.** Our two highest trafficked sites are cipherprime.com and playauditorium.com
* **""Lateral publicity"".** We love love love Starcraft 2
* **Missed lateral publicity.** We really should have more educational stuff out in the aether. We participate in monthly Unity technical meetups in Philly
* **Game Giveaways.** This was something that is potentially very useful
* **Other giveaways**. We have two beta keys for Diablo III from GDC
* **Social media.** We have really lopsided social media use. Twitter we're great at ([follow us!](http://www.twitter.com/cipherprime)), because we think that's a huge piece missing from the formula. If you don't use social media because it's tedious and irrelevant to making games, that's fine and partly true. But it's a different story when you're trying to sell games.
* **Your fans are the most wonderful people on earth.** You can't please everyone

Finally

But in any case, we'll definitely be doing smaller ones for future games and side projects. We've made the Kicking It Forward pledge, and whatever happens, we plan on using company funds to contribute to at least two projects a month.

Recently I wrote a [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/183e50/going_down_with_this_ship_my_kickstarter/) about my [Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/108259147/game-of-inches) project

That same day, I had five responses from artists interested in contributing to Game of Inches. After talking to a few and narrowing down the choice I Skyped with an artist named Keith. 

He not only shared my love for games but also a liking in football and previous Kickstarter experience. After settling on details Keith got to work on concept art for our logo and in game sprite animations.

After just a few days here is what he has been able to help us with:

I wanted to show you the project I've been working for the exact past 3 years. Alegria is an open-source 2D gamedev environment for Windows written in C++. It includes an engine and a visual editor

First of all

http://i.imgur.com/3UAjGDp.png

http://i.imgur.com/iaTrHcF.png

http://i.imgur.com/6qQTtZe.png

http://i.imgur.com/KLcvhC3.jpg

http://i.imgur.com/iPOt9oN.jpg

I made this post because after all this time it's time to drop the project for an undetermined amount of time (or ever). I've learned a lot with it and I wanted to at least show it here in this subreddit where I lurk so much. It's in a usable state

So, but still). 

But, with the editor and some demos included. To play the demos just run Alegria.exe. If you want to check the editor, run AlegriaEd.exe and open some of the demos (in the ""demos"" folder) or the launcher (""main.xml"") and play around! You can run the demos from editor too.

**What is Alegria exactly?**

Alegria is made of Alegria Engine and Alegria Editor. The engine is written in C++, I know, more on that later), Box2D for physics, OpenAL for sound and Python as scripting language. 

The editor is written in C++ too

**Why did I make it? (and why didn't I do lots of games instead?)**

This is a thing I see around this subreddit (and other sites) a lot: ""Make games, which gets in the way of actually finishing and polishing games. Which is very important...

...if you are interested in finishing a game. That was not my case when I started 3 years ago. I was in my 2nd year of college (CS student) and I had been playing around with Pygame first (dat Tetris), I would act as if I had one. 

To summarize, but at that moment it was not my priority. Also, I hoped (and somehow still hope) that it would help me land a job on the industry.

**Engine architecture**

For the engine I decided to follow a component-entity architecture. It seemed the most reasonable thing at the moment and I don't regret the decision at all. I think it's a good choice for most of the cases

At first I envisioned my engine to be used from code, I finally went to an Unity-like style, where the editor is were the developing happens. I decided go to an easy-to-use approach, where the only code the user had to write was the Python scripting.

The engine is structured as follows. Entities are basically a set of Components. Each Component holds data and is processed by one or more Subsystems. An example of this is a ball:

* A ball is an entity which has a Render Component and a Physics Component. 
* The Render Component holds the texture data and the frame of the animation the Entity is in
* The Physics Component holds the Box2D body which is used by the Physics Subsystem. The same with Keyboard

With that in mind, and while there are several solutions to that I decided to creating the Archtype class. Basically an Archtype defines a game object, and an Entity is an instance of a given Archtype (similar to the class-instance concept). So if I wanted 20 enemies, I'd just create 20 entities from the ""enemy"" Archtype.

**Engine input: Scenes**

Another problem that arose was how to manage the different parts of a game, level 1, level 2... So I used the concept of Scenes (a.k.a Screens and many other names, you know what I'm talking about). And with that the engine became a ""Scene player"". The process to load an scene is simple:

* Open an XML with all the data.
* Load every resource (Textures
* Create the Archtypes defined on the XML.
* Create the initial Entities from those Archtypes

And then the gameloop starts and everything runs smoothly. Changing from a Scene from another is basically repeating this process. PROBLEM: The engine has to read from the HD everytime it changes an Scene. Is it solved? Well... no

**Engine input: Python scripting**

So, Lua and Python were the two options I was pondering. And I chose Python. Why? Because I already knew Python and because I was (am) like super fan of the Blender Game Engine. And the Blender Game Engine used Python. The point here is: don't do that. Try to weight your options correctly. The other point is: it actually went okay.

I won't start a debate here, wooo) and got some nice ideas from there. 

If you want some more insight on how I did it

So, which is a Box2D thing), we just call scripts on those Entities. But when do we call them?

**Logic**

Once again

* Conditions: Events that happen. An specific key press can be a Condition. The same with a mouse click
* Triggers: Groups of Conditions. When every Condition of a Trigger is positive
* Script: The Script to be called.

So if I want a player to jump

**Why not multiplatform?**

That's a fair question. The real answer is that I'm lazy and I realized too late that using a window manager would have been easier and better. One could argue I learnt something about managing low level thingies though ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯.

**Editor**

It was all fancy and stuff, it's amazing. One of the best decisions I've ever taken.

I won't bore you (more?) with the details. Developing the editor has been just a matter of iterating and iterating, themes and decisions. In short, it went from [this](http://i.imgur.com/OxLjJ.png) to [this](http://i.imgur.com/ucqhFtq.png). I am actually pretty proud of it (despite being a buggy mess) because without Alegria Editor, Alegria Engine is nothing. 

If I had stopped at the engine

**The Demos**

Little to be said here. Those are pretty straightforward games that helped me testing and developing Alegria further. I really loved developing them and proved to me that games can actually be made with my engine

1363068288.0,1a4u8u,My experience with Pygame,niteshg16,150,29,31,"Hello

My name is Nitesh and I have been learning and creating a game in Pygame for last 3 months. A couple of days back

Here is my experience with Python and Pygame:

Python is a fantastic language for beginners. I have never learnt programming in schools and college and spent seven years of my life studying business management. 

Once out of the blue, so simple and straight forward, perfect for newbies :) For some reason I can't stand a C/C++ like syntax and it annoys me.

Before going into proper game development, only when writing a game I learned about OOP concepts like composition and inheritance. Stack Exchange has been a big help for me in learning OOP, though I still don't fully understand all tricks and ways of OOP.

As I only know Python language

http://inventwithpython.com/

http://thepythongamebook.com/en:start

I also read source code of some projects on official Pygame website to understand how engine works.

Pygame is pretty great and fully featured engine and the developers have done a great job. The API is simple and easy to understand. Some users doesn't recommend Pygame/Python for games that need high performance and they are not wrong. Pygame may not be as efficient as other game engines when you absolutely need to redraw everything on game screen each frame.

As I have developed a turn based roguelike game

I have been reading a few posts on r/gamedev and learnt that it is important to separate your engine code from game variables

In my next application/game I will try to make my code more modular and probably use json/xml for storing attributes.

Thats it

* The changelog says 'fixed random bugs'. If I already have the game and I see a bug
* The game is actually a demo
* Placing a game on the store that does not have a demo for free. I can no longer trust many dev's out there and will not buy without playing first. Too many times I have been bitten by the 'ohh this game looks awesome' bug and then get it to find out I beat it in 15 min or worse
* Ads that block a main part of the game play. I understand the ads and have no issue with them, I delete the game.
* Playing a demo, use it!
* Ads that play video and turn on the media volume for the ad when I have it muted on the phone. While I have not seen this in a while it tends to piss off my wife when she is sleeping and gets woken up by the ad. My wife does not get pissed at the game dev or the ad supplier
* Games that are almost an EXACT copy of another game with different graphics or only minor game play differences. I understand many game ideas have already been taken, I am talking like 30 out of 50.
* Games that require you to wait before playing the next turn because you need more energy. I will probably play the game for a day or maybe 2
* Games that have the in game purchases that are to enhance game play but in all reality are required to really play the game. If this is the case
* An over priced game. I will pay 4.99 or less without thinking about it, but it is a psychological thing. If it is 6.99 I will actually sit there and decide do I really like the game and is it worth this. But at 4.99 (or less) I tend to just immediately hit buy if I already enjoyed it.

Things that I could care less that I feel too many dev's spend too much time on.

* Graphics. I am not saying that I want to see stick figures and I understand that graphic artists can be expensive. But If the game play is good
* Sounds. 90% of the time I play with no sound on or at the very least the music (not FX) part muted. It just is not important to me. I have never bought a game because of how awesome the sound is.


Things that I love about games and will make me buy more from that developer.

* A dev that is responsive. If I find a bug
* Something original. I know this is hard
* Updates to games

I know that I may not be the typical teenage gamer and that this is not something that applies to all. But for me it is important. I figured I would throw it up here since it might cause some of you to get a new look at what a gamer thinks.

I suppose it's fairly basic. It's my first time coding a game, you risk going blind looking at it, you've been warned. I coded the game in Processing, for those wondering.

Here it is:

Win: https://www.dropbox.com/s/umjwiu6gncqjfe3/JunkShipWindows.zip

Mac: https://www.dropbox.com/s/8dkzvcf061x7fm5/JunkShipMac.zip

Linux: https://www.dropbox.com/s/7agyfa1hicyjgtf/JunkShipLinux.zip

Here's the source code (if you have Processing this could run the game as well
https://www.dropbox.com/s/0w2s471b9dyq7ce/JunkShipCode.zip

As far as sources go

**The Game:**
Now, at least that's what I've taken to calling it. The game has the player pilot this little ship that can shoot bullets (left click) and rockets (right click). The bullets can only destroy a brown earth platform. The rocket can destroy both the brown earth platform and the gray steel platform. There's a crystal platform that cannot be destroyed. Finally, there's a gold platform that can be captured (cannot be shot or shot through) for a huge bonus in score.

With your imagination, only speed up. If you hit a platform, you slow down to the first speed. The speed increases act as score multipliers, so there's some risk/reward there as to whether or not you want to go faster.

**The Story**
First year university, we had the entire semester. It would be my first attempt at anything above about 100 lines of code, let alone actually making a game. Technically, there were groups, and I had a partner, but she never touched the code (she attempted a few lines of audio but it didn't work, so I wrote it). She did help, just not the hard stuff. That's a longer story though.

So, the game mechanics suffered because of this, I had a lack of control because I was limited by the ""visuals."" Future attempts at game creation will be heavily lacking in assets because I'd prefer to work with game mechanics for now, instead of visuals. The game was inspired by AaaaaAAaa…!!! – A Reckless Disregard For Gravity, even though I've never played the game, just saw a trailer :P


**Algorithms and techniques:**

*Under Obstacle Class

The platforms will never spawn on top of each other (well they shouldn't, but it's probably too simple to be so. The platforms are each relegated to a column (with a width slightly greater than the platforms themselves). Within this column, when a platform is spawned by the game, it is given some random x position in this column (say column 3 would be 200 pixels to 300 pixels, where the platform width is 60, the platform would spawn in this area if it were of column 3). The y position is determined a little differently. For each platform, there's this thing called the lowerBound, 50 pixels exactly. No other obstacle is to spawn above this lower bound. So, there should be enough space between platforms and no overlap anywhere.
Note: The Background class uses a very similar method of looping images over and over (randomly determined).

*Under Ship Class / ShipWeapons

This kind of... just works. I guess what I did was create a separate class representing *two* weapons (Why would you do this, some calculations are performed (angle, starting position at front of ship). Finally, the bullet or rocket is launched. The rockets are never fired fast enough to require an array, but the bullets are. So the bullets are in an array. Every time the bullet is fired, the next bullet in the array is loaded to be ready for fire. Once the previous shots are off the screen or gone, they are reset individually (so as not to interrupt the entire array). For some reason changing the length of the array increases the speed of the bullets being fired. My reaction to this --&gt; [wtf?](http://i.imgur.com/4fFe5.gif). There appears to be no immediate correlation between the length of the array and the speed at which bullets are fired.

**Thoughts that went into it:**
When I was making the game, so even this decision was sometimes difficult to some players. However, I found with better skilled players, they could stay in a straight line, never forced to move. I attempted to solve this by adding a gold platform for score. Perhaps people like imaginary points? Alas, it is not so. Well, some do, finally

To spruce up the gameplay a tad bit, it still meant they had to move if they used it. However, the player could be at the end of the screen and attempt to shift off screen, but they won't move and the shield will still be applied. This means that they can technically stay in that same straight line as before, but there's a cooldown. So this isn't likely. 

Now, as the levels increase, so to do the number of platforms. Slowly but surely, the player is swamped in a myriad of interestingly placed platforms. The space between them is maintained as per the method described in the above paragraphs, but it's still very difficult. At this point in the game, I ran out of time. I tried my best to make an enjoyable game. I'm very proud of it.

So, anything, really. Feel free to completely laugh at my game, or complement it. Thanks everyone!

**EDIT:** 

**FLOW: (The balance of challenge and skill resulting in immersion)**

A small note about Flow. One of the most important parts of this game didn't even involved coding, doesn't have time to look around the screen while they're falling at a rapid pace and trying to shoot and dodge platforms (debris, damnit!). So, how do you tell the player their health? How do you show them the cooldowns? Enter peripheral vision! It's the only alternative, that or sounds, I suppose. The player's eyes are primarily focused near the bottom of the screen, so the most important info should be placed there, the contrast between green and red will do that. The reason the Shift ability cooldown isn't a bar at the bottom of the screen like the health (green / red) and the rocket cooldown (blue / yellow), doesn't need to be viewed as much as the rocket cooldown. Health is important so the player can determine risk/reward strategies effectively.

Now to actually get to Flow. Flow requires a balance of challenge and skill (I'm not sure I have it in this game). It also requires clarity of information, the colour of the score part is changed to blue to represent this change. Again, it's subtle, and it's not too important that the player is notified of their achievement (It might be too distracting). The benefit of Flow is that the player ""loses track of time."" It represents immersion. I don't have the content to capture that, of course, but attempting to implement some of the principles of Flow isn't bad. I've been capitalizing Flow this whole time to let readers know that it has a special meaning as opposed to the traditional definition of flow.

Also, preferably something that was also capable of eating at some point.

But quick answers to a few questions I glanced:
1) We aim to be different to minecraft. Look at peoples super structures, CraftWorld needs to be different enough to warrant playing both for different reasons if you want.

2) WP7 version is all retro mode. PC version and Xbox version also have retro version

3) The inspiration for it was being annoyed in oblivion/skyrim. I've got 10 sets of sweet armour

I'll write more later.

I've answered a bunch of questions. Most seem to be concerns with being too similar to Minecraft. I'll cop that. But the short end of the matter is that the full design is too large to simply just ""do right first time"". We've gotta get this game out, and become a seperate experience in the same emerging ""genre"" as Minecraft, giving gamers cause to play both.

If I was rude to any of you, code better, code faster.

Greenlight will replace the old Steam submission process from the 30th of August.  Instead of sending an e-mail to the 'gatekeepers' and waiting a few weeks for a yes / no response, possibly a trailer video but won't support game demos for the time being.

The voting system appears much like Facebook 'likes' - each user can either vote for your game or choose not to.  Games with the most votes will be greenlit for publication on Steam (when the developers are ready).  They said they'd be tuning the system a lot after launch

There will be a fairly sophisticated system for users to browse games

1370286253.0,1fljtd,I built my career on a QA job - a response to Nathan (RC) Peters,FamousAspect,129,24,75,"*This is a repost from an article I just put up on my [Gamasutra blog](http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/EthanLevy/20130603/193512/I_built_my_career_on_a_QA_job__a_response_to_Nathan_RC_Peters.php) in response to a guest editorial on Kotaku last week called [I Freelanced on Halo 4. it's time for an industry wide strike.](http://kotaku.com/i-freelanced-on-halo-4-its-time-for-gamings-contract-510353357)*

After two years I was forced to hand in my employee badge for Pandemic Studios

I was taking 4 vicodin a day to dull the pain of a herniated disc in my lower back. Wrist braces adorned both my arms to help control the repetitive stress injury induced by long days of playing Star Wars: Battlefront and typing. The herniated disc – acquired on a rare crunch time day off as I stood up from my couch at home – gave me a bit of a limp

I was heartbroken. I was rejected. I could not fathom why I was let go from the team I had sacrificed so much for. In time

I was a student during my entire tenure at Pandemic and still had a few semesters left on my degree. I sat in class

“How can I make them pay?” 

In the months following my layoff this thought popped up. A lot. It was a very soothing fantasy to imagine I could somehow extract my revenge upon Pandemic. Luckily I did not act upon this immature instinct

I can certainly empathize with the [tale of Nathan (RC) Peters](http://kotaku.com/i-freelanced-on-halo-4-its-time-for-gamings-contract-510353357) and his time as a QA contractor on Halo 4. I worked at Pandemic Studios for two years. The first year I was an unpaid intern working 2-3 days a week and full time in the summer. The second year I was a paid tester, repetitive stress injury in both arms, persistent pain in my lower back and legs and a Lead Tester credit on a massively successful Star Wars game.

Eight and a half years later the injuries have healed. My bruised ego has mended. I have worked for game developers big and small

Of course, fantasizing desperately about extracting revenge, all I could see was a pink slip.

I did not work at Certain Affinity. I did not work on Halo 4. I cannot speak to Mr. Peters’ personal experience. What I can do is share some things I’ve learned over the past 10 years that I wish I knew back when I was killing myself in the QA job that is the foundation of my career.

The first thing I wish I knew was EA Chief Creative Director Rich Hilleman’s “Shit in the bag” anecdote. You can hear it firsthand in [this spectacular conversation and lecture between Rich and Warren Spector](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVnkI_F6KKA&amp;list=SPC4AF467F9391D767&amp;index=13) at about the hour and seven minute mark. I had the privilege of working for Rich and this frame of understanding the workplace is one of the most important lessons from my 4 years at EA.

In the talk, but it’s there. And I guarantee you they know it’s there. And for the most part, your relationship with them is defined by this bag. You’re either putting shit in the bag or you’re taking shit out of the bag.” 
Rich goes on to explain that the secret to success on a game team is to make sure you are removing shit from your boss’s bag. Asking the lead designer to let you sit in on design meetings? That is putting shit in the bag. People are busy

At Pandemic I was constantly trying to prove my worth

The second thing I wish I knew is that getting a job on a game team, hand shredded hundreds of discs, ordered and picked up team dinners, made sure new builds were waiting for people when they showed up in the morning and had some ideas for a tutorial level involving blowing up Ewoks. 

The true path to that level design job I thought I deserved involved building levels. The tools of game design are cheap and plentiful. If I had any sense, I would have deserved that interview for an entry level design job that hundreds of others would line up for.

The period of my life after being laid off from Pandemic was one of my darkest (which alone

QA can be a shit job. QA is monotonous. QA is unglamorous. QA is thankless. But work is work; no one promised this would be easy. I owe my career to QA and the people and company who gave me that job. I only wish that back then,False,,t5_2qi0a,False,,,t3_1fljtd

When you are a hobby game dev trying to work on your first game as time allows, launch fighter squadrons, and use them to intercept enemy ships. While this is very cool (for me) it's tempered by the fact that I have only now surpassed where I was 7 months ago.

I had been reading about Entity/Component systems and think they are a pretty good idea even though at that point I had not run into any of the issues that Entity/Component systems are designed to fix. Not being satisfied with selecting one to use, that it was worth it.

After an initial burst of progress, I avoided it more and more until I regressed yet another level and started reading gamedev blogs and listening to podcasts and while still thinking of it as ""game development"".

For no reason in particular I decided to scrap it all and start over. I have hard coded game entities with lots of plain old fields in them. Position/movement data is similar enough across lots of entities that I have written a separate ""component"" that they all use. I imagine this is how I will be developing going forward; straight-forward

I've made more progress in my game in the last 3 weeks than I have in the previous 7 months. I still think E/C is a good idea and that my particular flavor of it has promise and is different from what I have seen out there

I have written this as warning to others and to myself

1. Get a bunch of old game art/sound into a bundle.
2. People can pay-what-they-want for a commercial license
3. Once the funds hit a threshold

---

**Contribution List: (so far)**

* Art assets from [a now-offline MMORPG](http://mmorpg.dracsoft.com/)
* ~50 particle textures
* Photoshop brushes for creating pixelart. [Preview](http://nightwood.net/prywatne/particles/brushes.png)
* Isometric pixelart tiles. Preview [1](http://i.imgur.com/qXgqw.png)
* An upcoming tool for auto-generating sprites from images found online.

**[PM me](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=nutcasenightmare)** if you'd like to contribute! You'll be the first people ever to sell something *directly to the public domain*. You could give just a few spritesheets

Basically it looks at and compares the 4 major Lua based 2D game engines, Love and Moai.  It starts out with a simple features comparison matrix, then presents a code sample in each of the four languages ( it loads and plays an song, then displays Hello World on screen and responds to user touch ) so you can get a feel for what the code for each looks like.

It's meant to run at 60FPS but if I have too many lines/objects (I'm talking about 5 objects and 80 lines - nothing compared to other games)

So my main update loop isn't very efficient as every frame it's checking every object and every line. I don't know how else to check it

Here's some Pseudocode for the object handler:

    for(i = 0; i &lt; objects.length; i++)
    {
        for(j = 0; j &lt; lines.length; j++)
        {

            {
                // Collision code
            }
        }
    }

1342983461.0,wz5h5,I'm a producer/Biz dev guy at a mid sized publisher - AMA.,thegameproducer,138,33,113,"Hi

I work at a successful medium sized publisher (mainly PC) and I'm principally responsible for finding/signing new games. As a result I talk to a lot of developers - big and small

Why am I writing? Well, forums, college/universities, twitter etc. Granted it's because devs outnumber publisher folks by 1000-1 (guesstimate?) - as a result there's a lot of guesswork regarding ""the other side"" - especially when it comes to the business side of things. After all - most of us got into this because we love making games - not because business is such a joy.

I sometimes lecture at game development programmes/courses on said topic and as a rule I spend 1 hour talking and 2 hours answering questions - so inquisitive devs are not a scarcity.

Daily I come across situations where great devs with great games shoot themselves in the foot simply because lack of information on the business side of things and having to play a game of ""what the hell are they thinking/what do they want"". I think that the lack of knowledge about the other side is a huge reason as to why publisher generally get a bad rep. Many deserve it - but there are valuable lessons to be learned for both parties.

So I'd be happy to answer as many questions as possible regarding any topic - publishing, platforms, contracts, trends - and try to shed some light on ""the other side""

Disclaimer: I'll won't pretend to claim that what I say is the objective truth - rather how things are looking from this side of the looking glass. Ignorance isn't bliss.

Also - I'll start off anonymous so I can give your straight answers regardless of silly NDA's.

**EDIT:** Oh, sorry.. '^^ soooo basically I'm trying  to make a game where the world is not cube based, but in order to make it happen I needed a good surface algorithm(BAM!). 

I also need to traverse the constructed mesh effectively. I want to make that happen with some kind of localized search algorithm. For that I need to sort a frikkin large array fast(via quicksearch. BAM!). 

But if I want to make a localized search

1342103002.0,wfxjk,mmoAsteroids goes into open-alpha!,wildbunny,122,21,100,"Hi guys!

(2nd attempt after quick last minute disaster!)

Ok

For the uninitiated this game was inspired by an april-fool which showed an MMO version of the original game

Changes since last time are quite minor to game-play itself; mostly just bug-fixes and usability tweaking:

* Map now centres around you
* Stars don't go behind the map
* Chatting doesn't fire bullets + added an icon so you can tell if a player is chatting
* Changed the speed + size of the ufo's to make them harder to kill

Perhaps the biggest change is the web-site; its been fully upgraded from just an SWF to entire site with a community forum where I'm hoping fans can help shape the future of the game.

I'm also going crowd-funded because I'm getting to the point where I'm running out of money (this is my full time job) and don't want to have to get some more contract work because that would greatly delay the progress of the game. For now I've chosen to do this via in-game purchases

Anyway

1342723786.0,wtwv6,How does Notch solve generating biomes over an infinite world?,Hach-Que,133,37,64,"I'm working on a 2D top-down game with an infinite world in my attempts to learn procedural generation.  Most resources on the internet seem to deal with procedural generation over a predetermined size and not in connected chunks.

Each chunk is 2000x1000x64.  This is so that there is at maximum

The chunk generation is done in a series of stages:

* Generate heightmap using Perlin noise.  The same Perlin noise seed is used in each chunk generation
* Generate rainfall / temperature using the same Perlin noise technique.

Now this is the tricky bit.  On average I only want to determine biomes once a chunk; I don't want the biome to change every 3 squares because that's unrealistic.

So I take the average of the rainfall and temperature of the chunk and determine the biome that is best to cover this chunk.  So I do this and then apply the biome to the chunk, no less.  In order to generate smooth edging on the biomes, I need to know what biomes are next door (so that they can be generated onto this chunk if needed).  **But it's a catch-22.**  If I want to determine the biomes next to the current chunk to create some sort of smoothing between biomes, I need to generate the chunk next to this one.  But that chunk requires the next chunk to be generated!  ... so on and so forth.

Minecraft seems to handle this pretty well

**UPDATE:**

Okay so I think I've got this worked out!

I've realised that I don't need to actually generate the neighbouring chunks to work out what their height, I can guarantee that if chunk A calculates what it's neighbours will be (without generating them) then those are the same values that will be used when the neighbouring chunks are actually generated.

Now that I have the values for the neighbouring chunks I can look into using some of the suggested smoothing methods so that they aren't so rigid.  I'll update again later with more details and some diagrams on how this is all working.

**SOURCE CODE:**

I put up the source code for this so that other people can take a look and see how it all works: http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/wtwv6/how_does_notch_solve_generating_biomes_over_an/c5gtsn5.",,t5_2qi0a,1342816486.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/wtwv6/how_does_notch_solve_generating_biomes_over_an/

1372338253.0,1h6bzh,Breaking into game design: Part 3 - learn to sell yourself,FamousAspect,115,17,19,"*This post is the third in a series about how to land a job as a game designer. Check out previous posts for details on [setting your career goal](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1giewv/breaking_into_game_design_part_1_find_your/) and [building your portfolio](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1gsj06/breaking_into_game_design_part_2_build_your/).*

Now that you’ve built a strong portfolio filled with tangible design works

When I was deeply involved in the hiring process at BioWare San Francisco

It is hard to explain to someone who does not have hands on experience developing a game the difference between a content designer and a systems designer. Or to explain that you need a systems engineer who may have previous jobs listed as a system administrator

So you end up telling the HR partner about the types of experiences you are looking for. You may write a list of studios to look at

I explain all this to help you understand what is happening on the other side of the hiring process. HR partners will forward the hiring manager resumes that come in through online postings, you must figure out how to sell yourself.

**Hero stories**

Part of the reason to [build an extensive portfolio](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1gsj06/breaking_into_game_design_part_2_build_your/) is to gain a number of design experiences to talk about. You need to think through those experiences and figure out what your unique selling points are as a designer. Everyone applying for a game design job is passionate

Hero stories are the stories of a real world experience you had that highlights why you are uniquely qualified for this job. The conversations you will have with people looking to hire you will be driven by the content of your resume
For instance

&gt;We started prototyping [Enhanced Wars](http://www.enhancedwars.com) by first laying out our design goals. These were a list of bullet points that started with ‘We will know we are done prototyping Enhanced Wars when…’ then listed out things like ‘we have a game with no stalemating’ and ‘we have played at least 3 full games with the final rule set’. My colleague and I did 22 iterations of Enhanced Wars within 24 hours. Quite late at night, we discovered gaping holes in the design and kept prototyping until we finally had a version that fit all our requirements with iteration 22.

Now

**Write your failure resume**

Another important aspect of interviewing for a job will be showing how you have learned and grown from past experiences. In order to sell yourself with a level of introspection and acknowledgement of past mistakes

The failure resume is a summary of all your biggest screw ups and the lesson you learned from those mistakes. These stories will be just as powerful as your hero stories

&gt;“At PlayFirst, I did not realize till many years later that I simply did not have the maturity level to lead the design of the game when I was so fresh out of college. One of the biggest areas of difficulty I had was in listening to feedback from the senior people in the company – I would often shut down their ideas (with poor body language and tone of voice) and make them feel like I thought their ideas where stupid. This negative cycle meant people did not like to work with me. From my perspective, I felt like the game was failing because other people did not understand my vision and I had to compromise it past the point of fun.
&gt;
&gt;Years later, he just doesn’t know the project as intimately as you do. So what I did was to listen to feedback then try and identify the reason why the game was failing to deliver that led to a specific feature request. So, if someone would say ‘I want feature X’ I would reply ‘I think you are suggesting this feature because you are having problem Y, is that correct?’ Now we’re having a discussion about root cause and motivation that the game team can solve, instead of talking about the merits of a specific feature.”

By writing your failure resume

Now that you’ve identified all the stories you wish to use to sell yourself

Obviously that is so inefficient it is funny, it makes me hate myself.

* Only if the full team agrees on an idea does it go to the Short List.

1334053677.0,s2crm,Speech Recognition for (PC) Games,Kuldra,105,12,8,"So for this little post I'm going to mix in some personal interest with a bit of a tutorial

**History:** So little bit of background. I found a huge interest in the idea of using speech to things

**What are we making:** We are going to be using Microsoft Speech API (SAPI) 5.1 (XP on wards compatible) to create a sound engine (so we can disable Windows help commands) that allows for input from the DEFAULT input device (so make sure your microphone is setup as the Windows default input audio device) to use a series of Grammar rules (more on this below) for recognition of the users speech.

This has applications towards games and it is in this sub-reddit mainly due to my fascination of its application within games. So I'd like to see if anyone else would enjoy some playing around with it.

**Languages Involved:**
* C++ (Can be done with C# using the same API)
* Windows API

**Grammar Rules:** Before we begin we need to know something about the rules which our little application will work with. Grammar rules are created in XML and converted to .cfg files to be read by the recogniser.
So what is a grammar rule? A Grammar Rule is a piece of speech which the recogniser will try to match against.
...
    &lt;RULE NAME=""TEST"" TOPLEVEL=""ACTIVE""&gt;	
        &lt;P&gt;Testing&lt;/P&gt;
    &lt;/RULE&gt;
...

If the user was to say ""testing"" (or because it is an older API sometimes ""Testicles"" which is fun) the speech engine will respond (more later).
Grammar rules can be as complex as you like and even use dynamic content:
[Designing Grammar Rules - SAPI 5.3](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms723630(v=vs.85).aspx)
Note: We are using SAPI 5.1 but the XML is still relevant.

So now we have our Grammar rules for our first run. Keep them simple (see provided source code ""plancommands.xml"") for now. As noted above this needs to be in a .cfg format

    hr = cpGram-&gt;LoadCmdFromFile( L""plancommands.cfg""

**Initializing for Speech Recognition:**
*Source Code Reference: Speech.h -&gt; bool CSpeech::Initialize() { ... }*

Okay so now what we need is something that we can use to sort out our grammar rules. The first thing we have to do is bring in a sound engine

This is actually quite a simple task. We'll be using *hr* to check for failures and killing the application should this occur. Near enough everything above is in fact a single line of code stored in a COM Pointer (be ready for a lot of CComPtr).
*Note: Check MSDN for more information on all of the variables used. It's a great resource for those not aware.*

I wont go any further into this as the source code will be linked at the bottom and is commented through (with further video links provided to my original source of learning this myself). Once this section is set up the only missing piece is to load our grammar rules.

**Grammar inside the main code:**
*Source Code Reference: Speech.h -&gt; bool CSpeech::SetGrammar() { ... }*

Now that we have our engine

Our recognition context was setup with the event handler during the last method of code:

...
    hr = cpRecoCtx-&gt;SetNotifyWin32Event();
    hEvent = cpRecoCtx-&gt;GetNotifyEventHandle();
...
    hr = cpRecoCtx-&gt;SetInterest(ullEvents
...

So what we do in this method is to create a piece of grammar from a pre-compiled grammar file (the XML to .cfg conversion before). The main section of the SetGrammar() method I want to point out here is:

    hr = cpGram-&gt;LoadCmdFromFile( L""plancommands.cfg""

by using the SPLO_DYNAMIC option we can change the grammar rules at run-time.
[MSDN reference to SPLOADOPTIONS SAPI 5.3](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms717262(v=vs.85).aspx)
*Note: No change between 5.1 and 5.3 here so link is fine.*

The only part to watch our for is the option in setting the rules state:
    hr = cpGram-&gt;SetRuleState(0
[MSDN reference to SPRULESTATE SAPI 5.1](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms986388.aspx)

**Now we're all set up (finally):**
*Source Code Reference: Speech.h -&gt; LPWSTR CSpeech::Update() { ... }*

The setup code is the main bulk here but honestly it is quite simple after you understand what each little piece does (which is my aim here so if I have failed to do so I'll answer all questions as soon as I can).

The update code does a few things:
* Check for an event
* Check if the event was part of our grammar rules; otherwise report ""No recognition"".
* If we have a patch get the result from the recogniser into *pPhrase*.
* Get the whole phrase as text.
* Print out the phrase and give a confidence match to the rule.
* Return the phrase to main code.

For more information on these parts I'm once again going to suggest MSDN. You can set certain options to get sections of the phrase and different parts but honestly it is well documented there.

The biggest bit here when thinking about this for use in games is the confidence match.
...
    wcout &lt;&lt; pwszText &lt;&lt; "" ("" &lt;&lt; pParts-&gt;Rule.Confidence &lt;&lt; "") "" &lt;&lt; endl;
....

This is a value of  -1
-1 = No confidence that it matches the phrase it thought it found.
0 = Some confidence in a match.
1 = If it isn't right then my name is Microsoft Samantha. (Oddly as noted before ""Testing"" in grammar and ""Testicles"" in speech usually results in a 1 match. You can train your PC to recognise your accent better).

I made sure that for my AI I only ever used matches of 1. This was to be sure to separate similar names of AI and to get a solid match when I wasn't using a PTT (Push to Talk) so it would skip most of my obscene rambling to myself.

**So we now have a recognised piece of speech... What do I do?**
Well this is where the fun begins. Luckily you have XML (Parse that shit in

I personally begin with a simple 0 options just a list of names and had entitys being selected by name from recognition to begin with. So if I said ""John"" the John entity would turn and look at the camera.

I really enjoyed Speech Recognition as a little project and applying it towards a game environment. Hope some of this was useful to you and below you'll find the full source code (1 class, 1 config and the SDK), the original links I used back in December to play with this initially and a little bit of troubleshooting.

* I always enjoy watching Wolfire work, where perhaps the scope of the game they want to design is a little too large for the size of their team and the time they have. It also seems like they focus on finer details before it's necessary (something of a lateral rather than vertical development approach, if you get my meaning). But then, I have no 3D or Unity experience, so I don't have a good sense of what that development cycle looks like.

* I was extremely impressed with the Wasteland Kings by Vlambeer. It's fun, the music is amazing, and it just feels *complete*, while still leaving me wanting more.

It inspired me to post this guide here first after it did better than I hoped. While some may not like applying the term pre-order to Kickstarter rewards

What degrees should I be looking into if game programming is in my future? Is the ""game design"" degree worth its salt? Does anyone here know if any companies take the degree seriously?

Edit:
I am looking into the development side of things. I do know how to program in a couple of languages (Java, Lua, and bits and pieces other places), none of them are particularly game-oriented though. I know a smidgen of OpenGL and GLSL. My focus is procedural generation, and I am making a procedural city generator in my free time.

Edit 3: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rby1_MzDbxA this is a slightly outdated video of the city generation process from before I took it upon myself to learn GLSL. It should give you a good idea of what I know already.

Does any of that change anything?

I released it about two weeks ago and as of yesterday saw a huge influx of users. The goal of the game is to destroy websites. To help users find fun sites to destroy I have a button which I call ""Site of the day"". This redirects to a new site everyday, and today when I checked how many had bought it, it was not in the 1000s that I had expected, but 12. That's around 1% of the new users. (For an app that costs $1, that is not much at all)

So my conclusion is that it's being pirated. Firstly I want to know where people are downloading it from, nobody has written anything about it which I find very strange if that many people are using it. 

Many people say that the pirates will market it to people who are willing to buy it

I'm 18 years old, sick to my stomach and generally depressed. 

I don't think I can topple the pirating business

Sorry for the rant.

**Edit:** So this post derailed a bit. Honestly I'm a bit disappointed; many of the comments are about wether piracy is good or bad, since the statistics I received is only from people pressing an in-game button), I have gained 10 sales. From 10 to 20. And I honestly don't think it's the pirates, I think the increase is thanks to some of you guys. So there. For me it has only been bad. 

And one more thing, encourage each other and support each other in their game-development goals? If my outlook is that it's a huge store and thousands of thousands of games, and that my change of making it is next to 0, why would I even bother making it in the first place?

The fact as I'd love to have a lot of games on the list but I'm having trouble making it. Now for me to consider it a game every designer should play It doesn't have to be a 'good' game. Just  a game that can be easily dissected to help me or anyone else grow as a designer.   I'll try to update the list as often as I can. All I ask is that when you suggest a game you give the reasoning behind suggesting it. now for the list:



* [Mother 3/Earthbound 2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_3): This game gives a great example on how to use emotional and Deep topics to progress the story without it being to obtrusive. In my opinion this game gives a perfect example of balancing between humor and the deep stuff. It was able to successfully make me laugh one minute then cry the next. 



* [Super Meatboy](http://store.steampowered.com/app/40800/):This Is a great example of how to make a game hard without being annoying. You die quite often and quite quickly but you never feel like the game is it fault and it puts you back into the action right away.



* [Megman X](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_Man_X_(video_game)): pretty much everything ego raptor stated [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FpigqfcvlM&amp;t=5m53s) (semi-NSFW)



* [Steambot Chronicles/Bumpy Trot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steambot_Chronicles):""Despite a slow start, and develop your mech how you want (and change it frequently), but the real love comes for the NPCs you meet.
See, but they actually have things they care about, and they accomplish them.
The main characters are in a band together, which is a huge bummer.
And when I say they practice, really good. And the others improve their skills as well, until the whole band is putting on really good songs... Songs that you heard when they weren't good.
To this day, and difficult controls (on purpose, I think!) the game eventually draws you in and makes you actually care about the characters. You can dress your own character in many different styles, and develop your mech how you want (and change it frequently), but the real love comes for the NPCs you meet.
See, but they actually have things they care about, and they accomplish them.
The main characters are in a band together, which is a huge bummer.
And when I say they practice, really good. And the others improve their skills as well, until the whole band is putting on really good songs... Songs that you heard when they weren't good.
To this day

* [Any valve game in Developer commentary mode](http://www.valvesoftware.com/): Essentially the game directs itself. You hear why the developers and designers set everything up in a certain way. (thanks for the reminder anttirt!)

* [Metroid Other M](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metroid_other_m)/other terrible sequels: Good exercise to analyze exactly what went wrong in terrible sequels like those

* [Minecraft](http://www.minecraft.net/):  There are quite a few articles about why people love minecraft. But one thing that skips over people is the fact that its a great example of how **NOT** to introduce players to mechanics. 

* [Super Metroid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Metroid) : I could Spend hours Dissecting Super Metroid. It's great at being expansive but focused. The level design is set up to teach you as you play And its great at telling a story with very few words.

These type of languages do not appeal to me as much as a more flexible language like C++ and I was wondering if there were any full tutorials on making a simple game that you guys could recommend.

1336158148.0,t79ek,Any interest in monthly free game art?,richtaur,103,18,28,"We've been pumping out games as fast as we can make them

So today I'm experimenting with what I'm calling [Free Art Friday](http://www.lostdecadegames.com/free-art-friday-lemcraft/) -- the idea is the first Friday of each month I'll be giving away (most likely via Creative Commons or Public Domain) some of our unused art that will probably otherwise never see the light of day.

The first package I've posted is from an unreleased game I was calling **Lemcraft** (for Lemmings meets Minecraft). It's up on [OpenGameArt.org](http://opengameart.org/content/lemcraft) or you can [download the full zip](http://www.lostdecadegames.com/media/images/posts/faf/lemcraft/lemcraft_art.zip) directly from our website.
