Can't get over how much I loved the Twin Cities and Minnesota in general. Wish I could go to school here. Everybody was so nice and welcoming! Also

* Minneapolis Institute of Arts -- amazing!! 
* Driving through downtown in general
* All the bridges
* The skyline(s)
* Como zoo

I love arcades to death as much as the next redditor, both in the Indiegogo letter and on Facebook.  This is their 2nd donation drive in 12 months.  They are locked in a lease at their current location for another 18 months on rent they cannot afford.  No small business loans possible, no food/drink licenses possible.  

There is enough unpaid back rent that the mgmt company will only consider taking ownership of all the arcade machines to cover it other than $.  The owner has stated he thinks it's ""because the mgmt wants to run the arcade under different ownership"", the landlord might like some tangible assets of some kind wherever they can get it.

It is obvious that the couple that own the store pour their heart and soul into the arcade, nor make up for poor business ownership skills.  (I could armchair-criticize how they run their arcade for days, but at this point it barely matters.)  

I'm pleading with anyone considering throwing extra money their way to keep the Rusty Quarters dream alive to rethink their decision.

Go to [this link](http://myballotmn.sos.state.mn.us/Default.aspx) to find out where your polling place is

2. **I'm not registered to vote

YES!  Use the link above to find your polling place

a. Photo ID (if your current address is on this ID

b. If address on ID is different from current address, etc) from the **past 30 days**; if you get online bills, just print one out, or bring your laptop/smartphone

3. **I just moved/I don't pay any utilities/none of the bills are in my name

Bring someone else with you who lives in your precinct and is registered to vote.  They can vouch for you that you live where you say you do.  If they're not registered but they do have proof of their residency

4. **I want to vote but I can't walk/drive to my polling place**

No problem!  You can sign up for a free ride to the polls, they will sign you up for a ride.

***

Now for the personal appeal:

Voting is a very important civic duty, it would personally mean a lot to me if you vote NO on the marriage amendment and the voter ID amendment.  Here are some reasons why they matter to me:

**Voter ID**

1. The amendment is written very poorly.  It doesn't account for a lot of unintended consequences.

2. Unlike voter ID measures in almost every other state that has them

3. No other state with voter ID laws has same-day voter registration. Election officials have said that the law

4. Unlike other states

5. The amendment

6. Once it's in the constitution as currently written, we should send it back to the legislature and make them rewrite it, and decide **beforehand** how they plan to enforce the law, so they don't force us to vote on something without first knowing all of the consequences.

**Marriage Amendment**

1. No one would want to be told it's illegal to marry the person they love

2. Gays and lesbians will always be in the minority; therefore, to stand up for and protect their rights

3. No single religion should be held above others and put into law, 5 of the 6 Minnesota Lutheran synods, many Baptists, Episcopalians, Anglicans, Quakers, Unitarians, have same-sex marriage.  We shouldn't be discriminating against those religions.

4. The polls show that the vote is 50-50.  Whether the amendment is defeated will come down to how many people show up on election day. **You could be that 1 vote that makes the difference** (think of Al Franken's election)! How empowering is that???

***

Thank you all!  Please pass on all the information about how to vote to your friends.  This is a really important election and it's really important that you actually go out and vote!  I'm happy to answer any questions about how to vote if anyone is still not sure.

I can get behind how the TCS rules state that the subreddit “Is to be a pleasant subreddit and an appropriate level of decorum is expected. Comments not meeting this standard will be removed. Individuals repeatedly not meeting this standard will be removed.” I support that we should be aiming to maintain respectful posts–even when talking to those who we disagree with. Moderators should be expected to lead by example and to hold themselves accountable to their own expectations. Especially if part of the moderator’s goals are to repair the community which has been torn.


Yet just searching off of the most recent posts
“you are some sort of incompetent

Name calling is not just using a harmless word. It deteriorates the attitude of the subreddit, but as a leader in this subreddit, you shouldn’t choose to call names. According to the rules of TCS decorum where people who repeatedly makes issues are removed, I can think of at least one mod who is doing just this. Lowering moral, stirring up frustration and anger, he is not empathetic—instead he is caustic, he keeps ripping off scabs just as they begin to heal. Mkrfctr does not meet your own standards through his comments in the past several weeks. 


In a similar vein

I don’t think that you understand that it isn’t the same 4 people complaining. A lot of people are unhappy with the changes that were made; moreover

The parking lot was outside of St Mary's / Marys place, i think. 

The last thing i remember was being at sneaky petes with the crew i was with, or maybe a roofie intended for a girl ended up in my drink.

Just wondering if you guys know any other places that are down in that parking lot, and some good Samaritan brought me to the parking lot to stay out of trouble.

I live in Minneapolis and get internet service of 40 mbps down / 20 mbps up through Century Link. I had a 6 month promotion from when I signed up for the service. During the 6 month promotion I was paying approximately $40 per month for the internet service and modem lease. I do not use or need a home phone line or television subscription so I only had this internet service. 

The 6 month promotion period recently expired. When it did

I looked up the prices/promotions for new customers at Century Link and Comcast. New Century Link customers can still receive what looks like the same promotion I had when I started with Century Link. New Comcast customers can get 50 mbps service and a basic TV subscription for $50 per month (for 6 months).

I called Century Link customer service. From the list of automated options, she would have to transfer me to another department if that wasn't satisfactory. I asked to be transferred to the other department.

When I first heard of a nightclub/old school arcade opening in downtown Minneapolis I was ecstatic. I was hopeful that the mix would make for a perfect weekend hangout spot for all my neck beard and club friends. But alas

The location, not giving a hit whatsoever to what lies inside. When my friends and I entered we were told...let Me emphasize TOLD...that there was a strict No Hats policy and we would have to leave them in our car or coat check for $3 each. Fine. Whatever. 

Upon entering we were treated to a Group of 4 or 5 people standing behind

The interior

The only coin machine is located upstairs in the far back corner

NOW. The real problem with Insert coins...The staff. The staff. The staff. First off

Insert Coins does not know what it wants to be. The staff don't know what they should be doing. The customers wander around confused. And all this for a $10 cover

There are cops down here, also, but that's sorta normal. {There have been thieves stealing cell phones on the Light Rail platforms and bus loading areas.}

While were sitting there, three cops hot on his trail. There's a loud bang, a cry of pain, and then he's lead away in cuffs, his shirt missing. Apparently they maced the hell out of him. 

We wait a little while longer, and our bus is usually very small. We decide to take a cab, and they park on the North side. We figure that we'll cut through the mall, so we head back that way.

Nope! 8 to 12 cops are guarding the entrance, the mall was supposed to close at 9:30.

I've pretty much had one of the worst days of my life

Well first off, but the internet girl (let's call her Ana) had been abducted by her friends for a night of partying. Okay, I thought. I did kinda spring this on her, and it is late, so I'll just see her in the morning. So I found a parking lot in a decent neighborhood and fell asleep.

When I woke up the next day, and all was well till I was at an intersection; I began crossing, and got SMACKED by this fucking van. My car's front passenger tire got fucked, radiator was leaking, could barely turn the wheel. It was a fucking mess. Neither of us were injured, though, but my car had to be towed away, did their thing

When I got there, but then tells me that she can't stay because apparently her boss rescheduled her to work all this week. At that point, I just felt fucking defeated. Everything had gone so horribly wrong, and now I was alone in a huge city I was completely unfamiliar with, no place to go, and bound to walking everywhere (Her parents wouldn't allow guys to stay there).

So for the next 6 hours, so cheap was a necessity. After all that walking that scorched my skin and blistered my feet, I finally found a Days Inn to stay at.

And so that's where I'm at now: sitting in my motel room

**Today's restaurant: The American Burger Bar

This is the third or fourth time I've been to the American Burger Bar, I'm cheap.

Today's special was the Cheyenne Burger, and a light coating of barbeque sauce. Not enough to overload you on sweet, but just enough. Cajun fries on the side.

First impression: Well presented, some were almost bare. If that's the worst gripe I've got, I'm happy. 4/5.

Taste: Fantastic. What a burger. The bacon was perfectly done. But my favorite part of going to the American Burger Bar: When I order a burger medium rare, if you can get it at all. The fries, as noted, were pretty uneven on the seasoning, but nicely done, not too soft, not to crisp. 4.5/5.

Service: The other couple times I've been there, and *slow,* especially given how quiet the place typically is during the day. Today was quite a bit better. I got served promptly, got my bill promptly. Didn't get asked if I wanted a refill on my water until I was done eating, which was less than ideal. I think they're pretty new in that building, and they seem to be getting the hang of it. 3.5/5.

Seeks out attention when he would like some love but he is never pushy or annoying about it. Not a big meow-er, unless you are opening a can of wet food for him and then he is very encouraging. 

I have had this cat since he was a kitten; he is just the most amazing cat and is so important to my family! We are in a bad situation and cannot have him at the hotel with us. My brother was caring for him but is now moving to a place he can’t take Sydney. We literally have until the end of this week (28th of October) to find someone to watch him for us while we try to find an apartment. I hate to have to do this but I am afraid that if I can’t find a temporary home he will end up in a shelter that will put him down because he is old. This would be devastating.

I'm looking for someone to appear in a new show now.

You have to live within 25 miles of Minneapolis to be eligible, EXCEPT you have to pay the normal taxes for it.

In this show

Once all the planning is done, and in the space of about four to five hours, completely renovate the room.  The renovation is worth tens of thousands of dollars.

As you can imagine

It's a great show

So please, and ask me anything you like! I swear this is for real. I love Reddit, and would really like to see a Redditor get a new room.  We're particularly interested in doing a library for someone.

Surprise Your Spouse with a Room Remodel!

Do you want to surprise your spouse with a room remodel? We are currently casting for homeowners to appear on a national cable network, master bedrooms, basements -- any ugly room that needs an update. The key is it has to be a surprise for your spouse! So if you hate a room in your house and want to replace it quickly, then this show is for you. From cabinets to appliances, flooring to countertops - you'll get a new room designed by the pros, at little or no cost to you! Homes must be built in the 1978 or later. And please don't tell your spouse that you're applying. Interested? Please email us at: surprisecasting@magneticproductions.com Be sure to include the following: - A brief description of what you like/dislike about your room. - A daytime phone, email address

I am part of a committee who are setting up a prom alternative for GLBTQA youth.  Our theme this year is a [""Masquerade""](http://i.imgur.com/blyclqp.jpg) ball.  It will take place on April 6th from 8pm to midnight.  This prom is intended to be a safe place for GLBTQA youth to have a prom they might otherwise not attend. We do have an age range limit from 17-20.  Persons over 21 years of age may attend as someones date if they pledge to be free of alcohol and drugs.

This is our second year holding this prom and last year was a great success.  We had only a few months to prepare and we ended p having 5 couples join us.  We do hope to have many more this year but we need help getting the word out!  There are pictures of the setup last year on our website.  This year we will have a photographer

1359729329.0,17p16b,Moving to the Twin Cities - where do you recommend I live?,twincitiesbound,20,11,62,"I know this question has been asked and answered a lot on here but I have a few questions about living in the Twin Cities that I haven't seen answered yet.

Some background: I am 26 and my boyfriend is 25 and we have no kids or pets. He grew up in California and I grew up in Massachusetts (met at college in Boston) but we moved to Sioux Falls last March because of the better economy/to try living somewhere different. I've really like Sioux Falls but there really aren't many people our age and the plane tickets back to either coast to see our families are very expensive. I also have some extended family in Minneapolis. So we decided to make the move to the Twin Cities area

We are moving in a month and neither of us have jobs yet

We are chiefly looking at Minneapolis but would not be opposed to living in St. Paul either. We are hoping to spend $600-$700/month (heat included). We also have a one-car garage in Sioux Falls so that would be nice but isn't a requirement. We have one car so one of us will most likely have to walk/bike/take public transit to work. 

We don't go out to bars often but do appreciate being near good restaurants. I've heard Uptown in Minneapolis is the place to be for all of that stuff. I'm hoping we can find an area that's sort of in-between ""happening"" and ""dead quiet""

We both *love* co-ops and ethnic food stores - Asian, anything really. This is the question I haven't seen answered - what are some good neighborhoods with ethnic food stores nearby? Do these neighborhoods have any co-ops and farmer's markets during the non-winter months? We also shop at chain grocery stores and Wal-mart for some things, but would really love to be near some non-traditional food stores, co-ops and farmer's markets.

Also

Thanks and I am very excited to move to your wonderful cities!

**Edit:** Thank-you all for the input! I will definitely be looking into a lot of those neighborhoods. It feels like there are so many options so having some areas to narrow the search to has been great.
