This basically means that

I just feel like i'm pumping myself up for the moment of necessary action - say, and i just, watch it pass. that is, until the moment has finished passing and the me that i am immediately becomes filled with shame at how pathetic i am. I'm not sure if anyone here can relate, or if any of your past 'you's can relate, but i need to hear some words that are going to break this cycle that i feel has been going on forever. I am sick and tired of a life of waiting, procrastinating and stagnating like some rancid old pond. I WANT TO BE A RAGING RIVER crashing though the mountains and down to the valleys!!

I know some of you out there will say ""well if you REALLY wanted to

at 19 i feel like i've looked back over my life so far

Yuck. So if you just: got dumped/fired/in a fight with your mom/put on 5 lbs

Resisting feeling bad only prolongs it. As I said, but do float along the river of that feeling until you are gently deposited on the shore. If you try to fake happiness and squash bad feelings, they stay with you. If you let yourself really get in them and just be, just be, then they will eventually slip out the back door of your life. You will be done. Not holding those feelings down with both hands and pretending, but truly done and free of them. We in this country are addicted to being UP, and HAPPY, I honor it like any feeling. And I am equally glad when it goes. 

All emotions come and go, and it takes most of the power away from the crappy feeling. And you will find this way that you don’t drag all that baggage along in life. Of all the repressed emotions. You’ll feel your feelings, and you’ll be done. You’ll travel light on the emotional journey of life, and that is one great feeling.",,False,,1358688523.0,t3_16hsd3

One weekend my cousin(Uncle's son) and I went to the local Six Flags where I promptly sprained my lower back on a roller coaster. I didn't know what to do so we went home. I couldn't stand or sit for a week and it was another week till I could stand well enough to get back to work(which was relatively miserable for another few months). 

While I was laying there with my sprained back

Fast forward 6 months and I finally feel mobile enough to start exercising. I started searching the internet for some excercise programming (didn't know of reddit till last year) and found the Crossfit mainsite. Say what you will about it being insane but as far as I'm concerned, it was at the time). Bodybuilding always seemed like masturbation to me, but functional fitness made and still makes absolute total sense to me. On top of all that, it was free. 

I obviously wasn't able to jump in to it with both feet

It was then and there (end of 2007) that I decided what my life's goal would be. It is my desire to expose as many people as possible in this world to the joy, chinup bars..etc) and open a gym. On top of this I will build and sell such equipment along with providing the necessary fitness instruction and programming. 

To become qualified to design and build the steel frames of fitness equipment I decided to get a degree in Mechanical Engineering. I moved back in to my dad's home and enrolled in my local University.  


Four years ago I attended a barbell training cert with Mark Rippetoe and I've been coaching friends and family ever since. 

Three years ago I met the girl who would become my wife. 

Two years ago I landed a well paying internship at an automotive manufactuer that allowed me to develop my experience with welding and 

in two weeks I'll be receiving my BSME. 

I've already built my first squat rack and just picked out a little house on a corner lot with a *huge* garage that will be my first gym.

I hate how I have to get up in the middle of the night and force myself to run through five miles of humid air, and there’s always one guy who just can’t seem to do it right. After work, I have to exercise AGAIN for another hour or two and when I finally finish that and figure that I have some ME time, I have help babysit and do tasks around the house. Before I know it, I have to go to sleep and do it all over again.

**Attitude Is Everything.**

I love how I wake up so early and am motivated enough to lace up and take on the streets for five miles in the dead of night, moving pallets and products, rather than doing sedentary office work. I wouldn’t know what I would do if I didn’t have the guys at work who actually know what they’re doing. After work, I’ve already got so much done earlier in my day that I’m lucky to have enough time to get a few more hours of exercise in. I end my day by playing with my nephew and helping my mom out with chores, since she deserves any break she could get.

I'm a composer and have been told throughout my life (mostly during education, that it was a hobby not a career, the list goes on. In fact, my dad once told me I was embarrassing to him for my educational choices. That hurt, but you know what... now I have a successful career. I can barely keep up with my work load, because I decided they don't know what they're talking about. They don't see what I did every day to get to this point, the hours and hours I spent in front of the computer just practicing composing, or the hours listening to people that already had careers composing

The point of all this is: Don't ignore ambitions, the struggle becomes less and less and the rewards greater and greater.

Depending on what you want to do, and how to go about it, then just pick a starting point and DO IT. I'm not going to say everyone who thinks they can make a career as an abstract painter will succeed, what I am saying is that if you be real, approach it logically, and gain knowledge from your failures, then you can succeed. Too often people view ""too much work"" and ""too hard"" as the same thing, then you just have to work hard. I'm not here to tell you it's easy

A person who excels above others, if your constantly focused on getting up, that’s all the reason to keep pushing on. It’s a matter of making the right decisions at the right time and working hard.

Cut the bullshit and just give yourself a chance. If you are struggling with something

Physical pain and emotional pain can be overcome with physical strength and emotional strength. It just takes the right mindset to actively pursue it. Complaining and living a life that is governed by doubt

The best type of failure is the one you get after you’ve tried your hardest not to get. It should fuel you to try harder

Bad failures happen when you don’t think things through and you beat yourself up for it. They make you want to quit whatever you were originally pursuing because everything is just too complicated and difficult. Bad failures happen when you fail and automatically begin to think negatively

Well guess what happens to be the difference between the two? *Good and bad failures are exactly the same.* **It’s your mindset that determines which perspective you ultimately follow.**

It might make perfect sense when you read this

Like halfway through your first 10 mile run when you think that it just might be too far. Or, better “planned-out” people are pursuing.

I’m talking about that really low feeling you get when things just seem to turn to complete shit. That’s what the words in this post pertain to.

I’m writing this with personal experience. By no means am I great at anything, that so many people to quit way before they ever really began.

Keep in mind that no matter what trouble you may be facing, push on, cut the bullshit and just give yourself a chance to succeed. If you just let yourself push on, your goals will be attained, your wishes fulfilled, and your whole life will be elevated a step higher than those who face similar obstacles and choose to give up. 

Give yourself a chance.

My problem, because I enjoy learning the material in that class. I enjoy it because I see the connections in the material and between the material and what I want to do with my life. An example is genetics. I really am considering becoming a geneticist, so I think to myself, ""This stuff is important, and the questions it poses are interesting! I'm willing to learn this material."" So I want to practice it, to understand it. However, I then realize that I must put other classes first sometimes. That's where the problem comes in.

Other classes, too fast. But I do pick up a decent amount of it when I spend time doing the work, and when I understand the material, it gives me a sense of satisfaction. I see connections then. I realize why things are important. But I also am aware that I will never use 90 percent of this. So my brain quantifies that material as unimportant, useless. I can't force myself to memorize material for a test and then never use it. I then find myself not studying.

Philosophy is a whole different beast. I really enjoy philosophy in theory. I'd love to look in-depth at the theories behind some of history's greatest minds. But again

I went to work and during break was in line for coffee. The guy behind me was more than a little attractive and he and I exchanged pleasantries. I opened my mouth to offer to pay for his drink in exchange for a conversation over them. Before I could ask, but then gasped. Apparently the object of my flirtation used to date this person. As I was abandoned with my pants steaming, I looked up to see what could only be America's Next Top Model loudly proclaiming how good looking ""Justin"" was.

I'm using a throwaway because people that know me well know my real reddit name. And this post reveals things i want none of them to know about me.
I am 20 something years old. Born in Early spring 199*. My farther a U.S. Airforce man. i grew up traveling the world. I've been all over this planet from Las Vegas
By the age of 5 i was living back in the united states. My grandfather passed away. At this age i didn't truly understand death or what it meant to never to see him again. I saw my dad cry for the first time the day of his burial. This impacted me in a way i didn't quite understand.
Move forward a couple years. im 7 now living overseas again in Germany this time. My mother and father are fighting all the time.I don't really understand it all but it gets to the point where my dad is living one place and my mother in another.
At this age i felt my father had left me to live with my mother because he didn't want me. i didn't understand anything. just that my daddy was gone. My mother started dating other men and moving from house to house living with them.
At one point my mom moved in with this man, and drive for 3 hours or more. The truck always smelt like slim jims and coffee and i loved it.
My mothers boyfriend was.. an asshole.. he didnt care much about me or my asthma
After a year or two of driving for 3 hours there and back once a month. My mother announced she was getting married to her new boyfriend and was moving with him to the united states. Well i wanted to live with my dad for a while and i did. I lived with him for 2 years before my mom married him. I went to a german school and everything just so i could spend time with my dad.
But then the time came. My mom was moving back to the USA and i was going to be stuck in a foreign county for an unknown amount of time. even though i hated her husband i wanted so much to be back in schools with english speaking people and to have a semi normal life.
So i made the hardest decision of my life to move with my mom and live with her.
I left my dad i left my step brother i left my half sister and i moved to the USA to live with her and him.
We moved to the fabulous city of Las Vegas
I was 12, and so much more. At this point in my life i met the one person in my life that would change me for the better, and the worst.
Instantly we became best friends and spent every day together. lets call him terry. I spent every day after school at his house to escape my own home away from my step father and i became a part of his family because they saw how much i hated my home life. they were my home away from home. They were my family when i felt like i had none. Me and terry would spend the simple days together and just live life as it was given to us, and explore what life had to offer.
By time i went to high school i made another friend. and we will call him james. The one friend in my life that showed me the evil in life
now when i spent time with james we did a lot together but there was one point where his brother got out of jail and managed to get a house of his own and invited us to come hang out with him. Now james's brother would regularly have us over and just chill but one day he offered us beer and what ever we wanted. so being the 14-15 year olds we were we wanted to try it and see what it was like. so we did. At james's brothers house we drank alcohol smoked pot and had a god ol' time. occasionally had parties and slept with very impressionable girls our age
meanwhile terry and i lived a slightly more straight life only smoking pot and maybe having a beer here and there when his dad wasn't home. Terry is basically my brother and will always be thought of as such.
Eventually by the skin of my neck i graduated high school. with a 2.0 gpa. over 190 missed days of school. the last day of my high school year i managed to persuade my history teacher to pass me by giving the most inspirational oral exam on legalization or marijuana i could possibly come up with on the last day of school as i turned into him my pass/fail card.
After this i joined the United States Army. i began my training and did everything i could so i could join. i gave up all drugs alcohol and every thing. i was in a pre-enlistment program where they just did a lot of PT and such to get you in shape and ready to join. during this time i met my future exwife.
Me and her had a connection that was stronger than the toughest metal on earth. we were inseparable i gave everything to her. We had 2 children together
My children through a lot of court custody trials ended up being given to my mother. So i still get to see them anytime im back in that state.
Im going to fast forward quite a bit here.
i mean quite a bit.
I am now living in a completely different state from anywhere else ive ever been. i lived with my dad for a year i lived with my mom for a while too. but now im on my own living in a 1 bedroom community housing.
I have exactly $6.34 in my bank account. Every penny i had extra to my name i put into 2 CD's for my children. hopefully by the time they are able t to go to collage and everything else these CD's will have matured to be able to take care of their needs.
I dont know where my life wil take me from here. but at this point i dont have much left to live. About 3 months ago i was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor. i was given 3-6 months to live.
I dont know how much time i have left but i know it is nearing an end.
The only thing i wish for is that my children be well taken care of. I have done my best set them up with trust funds and CD's and all that crap and left everything in my will to them.
My advice to you the people of reddit is just to live your life. Live like you have no tomorrow but prepare for it to end in a moments notice. we have a limited control over what happens to us. i may not be here tomorrow i may be. but if im not i want you to know that this was my story. this is a basic knowledge of who i and where i am from and what i have experienced in my life.
i've done wrong and i've done good. i bielive that no matter what the wrong i have done in my life that i will pass knowing i have tried living my life.
Thats what i want all of you to do is just to LIVE.",,t5_2qvm1,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/motivation/comments/1i989w/it_is_what_is_is_just_remember_to_live/

1367537893.0,1dl2r6,Inspirational Letter to Myself to Get Fit,Phenomenon42,21,5,6,"I wrote the below letter to myself on 12/27/2012, albeit embarassing.

This is likely the last time in your life you will have nearly three months to change yourself. You had a year in New Jersey and you tried, you have one last chance, in a world where they can be so sparse. Don't let yourself down, in a year from now, failure may be something you cannot come back from.

Do it now

Earn this. Earn it for yourself

Think of the confidence you'll have. You want to be that 60 year old dude that looks ripped, 26 year old that looks ripped.

2 hours a day. I am sitting in a mall now, 15 hours a day, it drags on forever, until the 11 hour days seem short. So now you have a chance to do what I could not, for 2 hours a day. Fight for more, Lift and Pull more and more often, earn it

Build up the strength in your knee again

Sleep more

Write and record, or baby carrots, or almonds, don't eat shit.

Go all in for 3 months, will you fail? I wouldn't, if I could work out instead of sitting in this mall, I would not fail.

A man does not fail quietly. If you fail, and sweating. Fail pulling weight, throwing punches, and jumping.

If you fail, then you at least know that you did all you could. But do not fail sitting at your desk playing games. Do not fail without lacing up your sneakers and sweating through your shirt. Fail hard. Fail like you are fighting for your life (and you are, truly.) And at the end, after not being able to make it through 2 workouts, you'll find that you can. And all those days failing, all those lost battles where you stopped and the video kept going, at the end of these 3 months, see the cut in your arms

You will be able to lift more, live longer. LIVE LONGER.

You are getting older, less confident, less good looking. More tired. Think of how tired you have been this year, hours after hours, now is your chance to prepare yourself for the next time you work all those hours a week. Increase your energy, and appearance. Push the limits of what you can do, so that what you have done

This is your choice to do. To succeed or fail. A man can be many things, and will conquer it, or fail panting on the floor, with nothing left to fight with. A man takes responsibility, will get the job done, no matter the hours, the mistakes, do this now. This is for you

Think of all the things you want. The glances from women to validate your confidence, and in bed.

Remember the feeling of not being restricted by your body. Of the first day you noticed you could run longer, and not feel your heart pound harder and harder until it is all you can hear in your head.

Your body will tell you to stop, and sit down to rest. A man will choose to continue, and will continue to fail exhausted, until the day he succeeds, exhausted, and one day, you will just succeed

I can see it now. As I sit in this mall, your job is to make us happy, earn each day for yourself. You did it for work, now do it for yourself. 2 hours a day is all it takes for you to have it, at long last. Have it, you can! You really can! You are so close. I've been here for 2 solid months of 12-15 hour days. YOU only need 2 hours a day, for 3 months. Commit to it. Prove that you can do it. 

Choose to ignore, find a way. Find a way to do it. Find it each day, the garage is too cluttered? Move the weights upstairs. Dad wont like that? Move them back down stairs. It tracks dirt up and down each time? Vacuum. A slave obeys the wont and it becomes the cant. A man finds a way. A man chooses.

To whom it may concern


in 6th grade(1999) I was diagnosed with depression. I actually was not made aware of it until I discussed moving out of my parents house and them expressing their concerns on me living alone. I have never sought meds as a fix or even to help. I smoked weed for a bit



The past 7 years I have developed friendships based off of working out and being healthy, but you know what? I am not done, I have a goal, and dammit I'm going to fucking reach it. I know what you may be going through, I have been there, I may even be there with you now. 

I'll make you a promise

You will get out of this, do not be afraid to ask for it as we all need support. There are millions of people just like us and there are millions of people who are here to help us, so remember you are not alone.  Some of us are stepping into uncharted territory, we are declaring war on our old selves.  If you need motivation look at yourself in the mirror and say ""Dammit, you will not bring me down today, I am stronger than ever.""

Once a middle ground is found I talk with them for about 2-5 min, then leave when we both stop talking with nothing to say about the given subject anymore.

There is an abandoned six-screen theater in my town that is just SCREAMING at me every time I think of it.  I want a cultural spot for people in my area.  I want to start a YouTube channel that chronicles the building up and running of such a venture.  I want to spin off channels for the comedy and plays to run on.  I want friends and family to join and have a great time running something for everyone in the area and around the world to enjoy.

But I do not know where to start .... at all.

I started my career in IT when I was 18 before I knew who I was.  Now I am 37 and I am someone else entirely but never learned to do anything but this.  40+ hour weeks and a family on a tight budget leave no room for educating myself to do something new.

My problem is that I don't feel like I've seen any results anytime I've worked out. I wrestled for 4 years until grade 10 and didn't recognize any change in my body for years after hating 80% of wrestling. It didn't make me feel good, I gave it a solid 2 months of going to the gym 4 days a week for an hour and a half and 2 days of cardio, resting on sunday. I've been watching my diet, avoiding fatty foods, gave up pop and beer, started drinking tea and water like a fish. I just don't feel like I've seen ANY results. I lost maybe 5 pounds after those 2 months and it frustrated me so much I didn't keep it up. Honestly, as much as I know it isn't true, shy of becoming a completely different person, love handles, watching a movie

I don't know what the fuck to do, so I'll see if that helps at all, but at this point I've got low expectations and will likely quit if nothing else changes, after all, if nothing measurably changes, what's the point? I don't care for the ""just so I can say I did it"" aspect. I could go outside and beat a tree with a stick for a few hours and it would seemingly render the exact same results.

One of thing that I have benefited most by doing this, then I really need to start on my writing. It can also be used to see more clearly what things you like to do. And then when I ask myself down the road, ""What have I been doing with my life?"", I can just look and see.

I even set up a day system. Today was Tuesday, and things I want to learn.

Don't edit, or anything. The things that fly our of you in this moment are what you believe so get them out. Now have a look at what you wrote. Some may hit you kind of hard. The truth hurts is an expression for a reason. Somewhere way back when most of us get injured and we internalize it, we feel unworthy of something in life. And when it's unconscious, it's powerful. Once we take those things out in the sunlight and look at them and understand them, they loose their power. So now try this:

Rewrite those feelings in positive terms. If you wrote, it flows to me freely as I am a loving and generous person."" Or whatever...just write something positive and self loving and even if it feels fake, it's ok. Say that sentence to yourself any time you think of it all day, every day and just that action will slowly start to change that belief. At first you'll be faking it, but slowly you'll actually believe, because it's true! And your inner self knows that, it's just buried under someone else's garbage that they dumped on that sense of worthiness many moons ago.

So imagine the most amazing, fit energetic body, financial prosperity, true love, imagine it all and then know you're worth it! Tell the universe your worth and you will see your life change. You will receive what you believe you are worth. So you better up the value on the cosmic tag hanging off your soul! (and of course I'm not talking just about money here with this heavy financial metaphor, I'm talking about joy!) If you think of yourself as bargain basement, that's the sort of life you'll create.

This isn't some 'trick' response where I say that being lazy is actually HARDER to do. Nope, creating experiences, etc.... all of that requires EFFORT. No bones about it, going out is definitely a lot harder than staying in, especially if you have any introverted tendencies. 

But the efforts are worth it. I have been in the doldrums for a bit because I've had a rough 2013. Yesterday while messing around on my guitar I decided to record myself playing a cover of Imagine Dragons - Radioactive. Now, it would have been much easier to just stay at home and surf the computer or watch TV. But if I would have done that I wouldn't be able to look back on these experiences and be reminded of those victories. Reminiscing helps to inspire me to create MORE memories in the future!

**If you are curious about the video you can check it out here:**

This all reminds me of one of my favorite quotes:

*""Happiness is not mostly pleasure; it is mostly victory.""*

I messed up my A-Levels 4 years ago due to alcoholism and just generally going off the rails whilst in sixthform. I'm now working full time and have done since

Growing up I was sort of exceptional

The last 4 years I have generally been feeling quite down about it all, I should have took an apprenticeship (my mum expected me to go to sixthform though).
My problem really is (was) my ambition set against my notion of success

Basically in a massive rut.  Ultimately

Then, and I started to see thing differently:

-Young

-Little debt

-Not locked in to a degree career path

-Free to go back to college if I want

-Got a job

-Gay and don't want kids

What I'm saying is, I completely lost sight of what's important. I can do whatever the fuck I want. Its not too late, and if anything - I'm better for my experiences and bad decisions. 

Now

I'm going to start writing again and finish the novel I started, and Im going to do more. Meditate and practice mindfulness. Try new hobbies. Look after my body. I'm going to stop squandering my money on frivolous indulgence and practice frugality. Self sufficiency. Just some of the things I am going to draw my success from.

But I really don't know if I want to gamble on that. I'm quite short 5'9 but my projected height is about 6'3 (my father and his family are all over 6'3 and my mom is 6'0). I really think I have the work ethic to be sucessfull at it but I feel like how hard I ever try there's always going to be some 6'5 American guy 2 years younger than me trying even harder. Even though that is the fact I still feel like I can for example get injured and I want an education to fall back on. 

I kind of cruised through elementary school (1-9th grade) and graduated with a 305 score. (16 subjects, Biology and Physics.

Makes sense I'm a social worker - very one-sided relationship. I love being there for others, I really do. And I am trying to work on my own wellbeing and self-care by not answering the phone, remembering that people can care for themselves, blah blah. But some days I just want someone to ask ME how I'M doing, you know? Without just waiting for me to finish talking so they can talk. I'm so burned out in my life that I'm not even doing a very good job of caring for others anymore.

Think about how you can't wait to hate yourself tomorrow so you can feel even better than you do now. Think about if you keep it up for another week

I'm a 20 year old living with a minor form neurosis, save for that occasional ""spur of the moment"" where I manage to be inspired, but the inspiration quickly dies… Okay... Deep breath in... submitting *now*.


There's a lot that factors into my current status


I am born and raised in the bible belt, it is the least of my worries. I entertain the idea of doing some not-so-nice-things to them (sabotage) I really don't have the luck, intelligence or determination to do any prank on them. Although I'm not Christian, I do have respect for the Golden Rule. (I'm agnostic, because I don't believe you can prove or disprove anything. It's my personal opinion. That usually spares me from debates based on religion, which I find such a drag… I hope you guys won't give me heat about it. It's not why I'm here…)


Just a small town girl


I grew up with my mother leaving from my small town, my father is the one who drove us to school and picked us up. I don't remember my father ever being violent with me, but there were scuffles between him and my teenaged brother and sister. A lot of things happened, and my mom was oblivious to a lot of it. So was I, because I never became self aware of anything until just around the time they divorced.


My sister and brother graduated


My parents divorced


My sister, now she works to jobs. She strips for the Shriners when they request her. Her boyfriend doesn't know. She didn't believe I was looking for a job… and her boyfriend, who moved in, doesn't like me either. The negativity was killing me, and it didn't help that I couldn't find a job, not even in fast food. That's just fine because I don't see her as family anyway. (I have no sibling that is of full blood, only half-sibling.) My brother actually encouraged me to ""go make something of myself to prove to everyone I'm a bad ass"" when I was leaving. It was nice of him to say that… Uhh… My ""boyfriend"" (a term he and I both agree to be overused and terrible) encouraged me to go to school, but if there are questions about anything, masturbate


I love to write, found some of my files on the computer and praised them, like they were really that amazing. Any guy would say that to a girl they liked, so I didn't take it to heart until recently. Ben in just like me, and he knows me more than I know myself… but, fuck (…lol) I hardly know who I am. The one thing we don't have in common is passion. He has all the passion in the world, so much passion--more than any person I've ever met has, more comfort that I've felt since I can't remember. I'm not worried about dying alone because of him, and ugh--he is a Star Trek nerd, unknowingly up votes it.) and all the things that relate to space (also find on reddit.)


I spent most of all my life in front of a computer (dad made me PC's for me upon request) and I got into games for a while, and I LOVED that. Met my ex through it. (He wanted me more than he wanted to role play though, that's when I lost interest.) He was very literate, posted multiple paragraphs, and we did everything thinkable. However he never presented ideas, which is sad. Now I've got games, stories and role playing out of my system… but I would like to write again… Ben is really hoping I pick up where I left off in the scifi stories I write


Reddit, going to websites specially for the unmotivated, and all other things I could think of. Ben tells me I'm just stressed, but I'm not anymore… I live in a quiet house, I don't have to work, I have plenty of food and a warm, soft bed, just for the financial security. If I tried to go into anything like screenwriting, or any special event… Just writing in solitude… but I can't even do that anymore. I'm not far from going out like Elliot Smith (I appreciate those of you who don't have to google what I mean). I don't know what to do to get over this funk… but I've be very grateful if I just got advice


**TL;DR** I'm a sad sack who can't get no motivation. Please help?

The problem with me is despite knowing that I shouldn't get angry at such miniscule things I can't help but spiral into complete frustration and anger when things happen. For example:

Last night I went to bed happy, it was all good. So today I wake up (hoping it to be a good day) and log in only to realize that a $3000 scholarship for school (that I normally get every semester) won't be coming the following semester, because they couldn't issue enough. Okay here, in the past, I'd probably have been pissed off...but I've read and learned enough that I shouldn't take everything so badly, I shrug my shoulders.....""whatever""  I tell myself.

I look at my phone bill and realize I was charged over $30 for ""roaming"", he said 95% sure he can do it, apparently not).

So now I'm super pissed off AT EVERYTHING, irrelevant things. I HATE this feeling. I mean a guy was using his weedwacker outside and I got irritated, heard a bunch of people talking loudly outside my apartment and mumbled to myself ""why can't they just shut the fuck up!"", phone range twice within 10 minutes and I'm thinking ""leave me the fuck alone and stop calling!!!!""

How do you relax when you're in that state? It's a lot harder to just tell yourself ""relax! relax! relax!""

Are there any methods you guys suggest for feeling better in these types of situations???

Basically I'm a four-year student in college and I'm stuck home for the summer working at a dead-end job. I just had a horrible breakup with a person I very much liked but who had become distant. I really want a way out, or I want to make something that reaches out to people and makes them smile (it's one of my dreams to be able to make a large amount of people happy).

**THE PROBLEM**:
Problem is I have trouble when doing things, drawing, comics, writing. I am not very good at many of these things due to lack of practice, but whenever I practice I get so discouraged at my bad work and how long it's taking to get better. I have ADD and when I'm depressed my concentration is especially short so I keep fluttering between things and never getting any real work done.

Thursday was the day I'd assigned to finally write a short story that had been bouncing around in my head for a little while. I muddled through it

Friday was a little bit better. I made it to the Art gallery, so the weather helped. 

Yesterday... yesterday i ended up going into work. While it wasn't awful

Today was unfortunately similar. My thing of the day hovered over me until very late. it was nearly midnight before I started and I honestly don't intend to finish it before going to bed. Though it was beautiful and summer-like outside my door, not an argument, but a heated discussion about something we disagreed. I felt vilified, he felt belittled, it was frustrating. 

i don't really know where to go from here. Tomorrow I have the gym down once more. My hip hurts and tomorrow promises to be nightmarish at work

",GooseNuckle,8,1,1,"I believe that the majority of our lives are lived with mental presumptions about everything. Our lives are made to outline a constant stream of routines. The reason for this

What I've come to realize is that our subconscious decisions really drive the way we deal with life

First, is our preference for an undisturbed equilibrium. It's so easy to simply get comfortable with a certain workload, especially if it's a bit higher than your immediate peers. Things become manageable and the ole' adage: ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"" might start to take hold in your mind.

Assimilation, which usually reproduce predictable, desirable actions. This fits well with creating habits and routines because it explains why we like working with people who help us get things done.

Equilibrium. We all tend to cultivate our lives─and the things that affect us, our bad days are bad because of unexpected kinks that show up and make us work a bit harder than originally planned.

Explaining these factors may seem as if I’m sputtering out common sense

We should NEVER be content upon assimilation to a group ideal or idea. It might be great for developing your initial senses for a specific subject matter, which in turn, ultimately further enriches society as a whole. Even if it means doing it under the shadows of doubt, with no backers and by their lonesome.

When our lives become manageable, finding this equilibrium can do wonders for stress levels, which in turn, has a positive affect on our overall mood. But I believe that becoming reliant on maintaining such equilibrium will eventually cause a negative impact in our lives.  Bad days come, moods vary and things change. *Having a preference for an undisturbed equilibrium will make the bad days worse and the good days mundane.* 
 
We should always be trying to move from bad to good, even if nothing bad is really happening in my life, then it’s time to stir things up. Maybe it’s time to get uncomfortable and make a big decision that will provide some new perspective and scenery. 

Take the time to lurk, so if you find yourself frustrated with contentment, then take a leap into the unknown. Achieving excellence doesn't mean you have to win any medals or set yourself apart from the rest of humanity. It’s far more productive to compare yourself with your past versions, rather than with versions of others who may have been fortunate. 

Achieving excellence should be completely introspective

TLDR: Don't be lazy and read it!

Its going to function a lot like the 'Beachbody Challenge,' which is free but normally run through Facebook.

However, workouts, and ideas for people that are just diving in to better health. These will be thing like push-up challenges that are catered to each individual and focusing on increasing how many they can do in a month, etc...

I've always been fascinated by motivation and tried to ditch my procrastination for many years now. I failed tons of times and I still can't stop procrastinating whenever I want but I did have a few victories too.

I used to smoke up to 40 cigarettes per day and after years of trying to quit I finally did it. It's been 4 years since I stopped this July.

I've also been chubby all my life. I was able to change my diet

I always wanted to learn how to play piano but I would always give up after an hour of trying. After years of watching my piano gather dust I was recently able to learn my first full song.

There were a bunch of other similar mini victories. I seem to get bursts of sudden motivation that I can't really trigger at will even though I would have loved being able to.

I have however noticed something about the feeling I get moments prior to the motivational outburst that leads to successful completion of the task or change I was trying to accomplish.

I feel like I'm in some sort of state. My head feels foggy. I feel very calm and content. It almost feels like I'm meditating. My mind is clear and I'm not thinking about anything as if I just woke up from a dream and chilling in bed. I have a slight vision of the task that needs to be done but no emotions or visuals associated with doing or accomplishing the task. Just the thought of that task. Not even that. A representation of that thought in my mind. It almost feels like a little faded block of text at the back of my head: ""Must start redecorating the house"" for example. 

When I start doing the task I stay in the moment. I feel like I can't fail. I feel extremely calm and I don't have anything on my mind. I feel like I have reached the point of no return and only way is ahead now. I feel unstoppable. 

Here are a few things I've noticed.

1) I was never able to motivate myself to do anything when excited, frustrated or angry.

2) I was never able to motivate myself by reading a clever motivational quote. Yes

3) I was never able to motivate myself by scaring myself. Like thinking about how short life is or how if I keep on smoking I'll die from cancer etc.

4) I was never able to motivate myself by imagining my goals. For example if I have to make myself build a web page and I imagine how great and awesome a completed page would look like I would never get myself to actually start building it. If I imagine myself working on it and stop concentrating on the end result

Excuse my long rant type of post but I would really love to hear your success stories. What lead you to suddenly start doing something you failed at previously

I would love to be able to force myself to go into that state at will. I would be fucking invincible.
