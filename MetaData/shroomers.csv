I was nervous to try shrooms because this past year I went through an incredibly traumatic event that put me into a depression. And I thought that it would cause me to have a bad trip. I could not have been more wrong.
Everything was radiant and beautiful. I was seeing the world in a completely different way. The world was more vibrant and at the same time so peaceful. I felt connected to the world; I was one with it. It was so strange to me because I have come close to ending my life before
I can't really explain how things made sense
Everything felt right.
I have always had some self-esteem issues before taking shrooms.. But in a matter of one night I learned how to love myself and who I am

I have a totally new outlook on life and I feel so optimistic for the first time ever.

* 1:30: Oh jesus, or I'm just high. Looking at the TV burns my eyes a bit, and the image is burned into my eyes for a few seconds when I look away. I feel like a kid again. I'm ok with who I am - something I haven't felt for a long time.
* 2:00 Watching an animated movie. It's hilarious. Everything is so much more interesting. I'm becoming really empathetic. The TV is a fixed point against the wall...and the wall is moving. A lot.

I enjoyed that for awhile. After a few hours, life, and everything that bothers me. Anxiety cut through me like a knife plunged into my heart and left there. My friend was amazing at dealing with this. He taught me how to be ok with it. Maybe I have to feel anxiety, but I can live with it, and it will go away.

The trip ended at about 6 hours after I had taken the mushrooms. I felt like I had been gutted like a fish, and the most painful thing I've ever experienced. 
[The song Forty Six &amp; 2 by Tool](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tja6_h4lT6A) perfectly describes my trip.

I wrote this Sunday morning:

Both heaven and hell in the span of an hour -

a beautiful torment that cuts like a blade.

The hand of the healer that grinds me to powder

then rebuilds my mind through the pain.

I made the tea about a week ago with 135g of fresh cubensis, as I'm a bit paranoid and apprehensive when it comes to drugs

I put 2 liters into a water reservoir out of a camelback, and had a few *minor* visual distortions, but nothing really worth talking about. I had a few paranoid thoughts about my heart stopping, but I was able to push them out of my head relatively easy.

The next day I upped the dose to the rest of the water bottle, because their facial expressions were either really convincing or not at all. I didn't see any brightened colors or anything else. It was pretty lackluster of a trip.

Then two days later, finishing up the rest of the half and started seeing beautiful colors. I was in such a happy state of mind, so content with life and absolutely no worry of a bad trip. I thought 'Fuck it. lets go for the rest.' Melted down and drank the other Liter of tea over the next 30 minutes and it was absolutely euphoric.

All the colors were so beautiful. 2D pictures seemed to pop out at me

It was nothing like I expected. When people talked about faces morphing, but mind numbing. Out of everything my vision and mental capacity were increased by a large amount. Everyone said that using a computer would be impossible, but I ended up playing League of Legends with my brother for the next 3 hours, playing better than I ever had before. For those who play, I normally play at a Silver I level, and I'm generally a pretty toxic player, which I would have to say is probably due to my depression. That night I found 3 koreans to play with, mistakes I made, how terrible of a person I was

Although we didn't come back that game, which I never in the entirety of my life would have thought I could achieve.

The positive mentality from that night 2 nights ago has stuck with me for the past 2 days

Playing games is great and all, I had so many epiphanies about life. I was a bit in denial that night about being depressed. I thought that I was just a lazy fuck, but I honestly was in a very deep depression and that became so clear to me. All the commercials you see for depression medication became so clear to me. It WAS like a cloud was following me around, raining on me, or like my foot was tied to a ball and chain that I had to drag around. And this night, that had been completely lifted. Everything became so clear. Just like the game, I was able to see so many options in life. After nearly failing out of college, I saw other options I could take, and that I wasn't so bad off after all.

For the past 2 days not tripping, go out and exercise, and to be friendly with people who I hadn't previously cared for. And my family has noticed it, saying they're so glad that I'm feeling better, even if it has only been 2 days. I didn't realize how much my depression had a bad effect on my entire family. My little brother's sadness seems to have been gone, he is waking up for school much easier, my dad and mom went exercising yesterday and had a great time

* Grind up your (dried) mushrooms using a coffee or weed grinder
* Get enough lemon juice to suspend the powder. Although it's not great to drink I like to us two lemons as it speeds up metabolism
* Combine the two
* Drink the whole concoction down! It's not very pleasant but it sure does work.

And that's it. Using this method your trip should feel twice to three times as strong as your dose regularly would (although individual variance can affect this hugely).

========================

I have such clarity of feeling. I can actually feel now, sometimes it wasnt there. Now that is all gone. I feel as I felt after the motorcycle accident, where I couldnt see a bum on the street without giving him 5 dollars. 


I want to remember how it feels right now
I feel as though I will give myself in an instant to save my partner. Other women too for that matter. Any of the women I have slept with


I want to give of myself to everyone in everyway I can. I want to tell everyone I know and everyone I meet that I love them. Because I do. I really and truly do. I have felt this before, and I wish I could tell them all I loved them. Every last one.


I did see some interesting visuals about 6-8 hours in


All I can say to any first timers is that you should start with a small dose, by and far, one of the safest drugs* **in my opinion.** Most of the trip just felt like being stoned on really good pot. That is probably related to the dose that I took, and the fact that the veil hadn't broken because the guy who gave them to me was impatient and didnt let them be in the sun long enough. I will be growing my own and tripping again soon. This definitely wont be the last time.

Hey guys, someone named 0xidium approached me, and reported that it was possible to retrieve a copy of our database. Although our site itself is believed to be secure, I have an account on a different site which is vulnerable. This allowed people to retrieve the list of users and passwords in plaintext. To my embarassment, I disregarded basic security practices, and re-used my password on certain sensitive parts of the Shroomery and Growery. This problem has existed at least since August, and possibly much longer.

We are extremely lucky to have been alerted to this problem when we were. Unfortunately

* E-mail addresses associated with your account
* Unencrypted private messages
* Posts in restricted or private forums and journals
* IP addresses associated with your posts
* Image uploads
* The SHA-256 hash of your password

The last item is especially important. Although an SHA-256 hash is believed to be one-way (meaning you cannot deduce the actual password from the hash), and eventually find a hash that matches. If your password is a common word, or combination of words and numbers, or a geometric pattern on the keyboard, or leetspeak, it can potentially be retrieved with a dictionary-based attack by someone who has our database. If you use the same password on other sites, especially e-mail, or social networking

I wish to be clear that

Going forward, which will help prevent dictionary-based attacks in the future. The site is more secure now than it ever has been, and we will continue to work to protect our members to the best of our ability. We hope you will forgive us for this recent failure.

From research knew that p. azurescens flourish in this season and environment. The mushrooms found match many features of p. azurescens such as, and rapidly bruising flesh from blue to black. The only thing that threw me off is the ones found were missing the distinct UFO shaped cap and were also a light tan as opposed to a dark caramel color.

I started feeling light and things started to slow down a bit 20-30 minutes after we ate them. My friend also started to feel the effects coming on. Now, crazy things all around the room. At 10:30 the trip was hitting me, and my body could not stop shaking. I wasn't panicking or anything, as the visuals became greater I was really enjoying it. The thing I wasn't enjoying, although was how I felt physically. I couldn't get into a comfortable position, my limbs felt heavy, I would have random parts ache for a split second. As the trip intensified, it was just like my thought process was going a lot faster than I'd expect it to. We were playing Marvel vs Capcom 3, then I'd forsure lose it.


He sat back down and we continued to trip out. The whole room was moving, my friend goes ""When do you want to smoke that weed man?"" and I said ""Now."" So us two and his brother go out in his backyard to smoke out of their bong. Now, their mother is a really floral person. Crazy plants everywhere, a forest out back, vines and roots and leaves all around the wooden planks of their patio. I looked out into the forest and I saw plants that were shaped like faces, lots of them. I just laughed and said ""that's awesome"".


After we finished the bowl, self-discovering trip ever. I opened up to my friends, telling them how much they mean to me, opening up about my dark family past, and I was realizing who I was as a person and who/what meant a lot to me and did not mean anything to me. At this time I'm tripping balls, I look at the ground and there's kaleidoscope patterns everywhere. I look at the nearby roots and leaves, and they look as if they're breathing to. But with every 'breath', almost dead. I look over to my bud that's also tripping

I was trying to grow some B+ cubes on BRF cakes. I took meticulous care of these cakes-- they were my babies. Humidity gauge always read 90-100%, etc. I followed all of the guides step by step and produced only measly small shrooms that were all disfigured. 

So I said fuck it. I'm starting over. I wanted to do a monotub grow. I tossed (literally) the BRF fruiting chamber into my garage and walked away. About 3 days later I remembered I never threw them away, there were 10+ shrooms all 4-5in long, and as think as my thumb.

The weather has been humid enough to keep these babies growing. They were literally laying in a mess of perlite, a massive amount of mushrooms still managed to thrive.

I am completely amazed at how resilient the mycelium is and how well these mushrooms grew. Just take this into consideration if you're ever worried about giving your cakes the perfect conditions.

‚Ä¢	MAGIC MUSHROOMS ARE OUR TEACHERS AND YOU SHOULD EXPECT TO PURGE
‚Ä¢	AT THIS POINT I FEEL NATURALLY AS IF I AM WITH A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO BOTH KNOW THE ANSWERS AND ARE ASKING ME QUESTIONS

‚Ä¢	I FELT AS IF I HAD LET AN ENTIRE COMMUNITY OF MONKS, GROVES, MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ALL FROM THE WONDEROUS RECESSES OF MY HEAD BOTH REAL (PARENTS, FRIENDS, FRIENDS PARENTS) AND JUST PEOPLE OF THE WORLD CAME TO ME AND MY KNOWLEDGE AND IT WAS TOTAL PEACE, TRANQUILTIY AND DAO UNDERSTANDING. IT WAS THE MOST SIMPLE EXPRESSION OF LIFE AND THROUGH HELPING THESE ‚ÄúPEOPLE‚Äù ONE BY ONE ACHIEVE A ZEN UNDERSTANDING I WAS REAFFIRMING TO MYSELF, AND EVERYTHING WAS EXACTLY AS IT SHOULD BE

‚Ä¢	AND THEN I PURGED, NEGATIVE AMOUNT, JUST SPACE) OF SERENITY THAT EXIST IN NATURE ALSO EXIST IN MY HEAD AND OTHERS WILL SEEK ME TO ATTEMPT TO FEEL THAT SAME SORT OF UNDERSTANDING AND MY WHOLE PURPOSE IN LIFE IS TO HELP PEOPLE PEACEFULLY COEXIST WITH THE UNDERSTANDING OF REAL-LIFE AND REAL-NATURE AND THE NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ANYTHING AND ANYTHING ELSE

‚Ä¢	TONIGHT WAS LOVELY AND THE CLEANING WAS HALF THE FUN√ç

‚Ä¢	YOU REACH APOINT WHERE BRINGING THE MUSHROOM TEACHERS AND THE SUBSTANCE HELPERS IS GLUTTONOUS

‚Ä¢	 DRUG USE IN GENERAL AS A MANIFESTATION OF ATTACHMENT, TEACH US THINGS, AND RUIN OUR LIVES, AND TURN US INTO THE SUBSTANCE THEMSELVES. MODERATION AND BALANCE, AS WE SEE EVERYWHERE AND EVERYDAY IN NATURE, IS THE KEY TO A HEALTHY HAPPY HUMAN LIFE AND IT IS SILLY TO ASSUME WE SHOULD LOOK ANYWHERE ELSE

‚Ä¢	WORDS THEMSELVES ARE A GLUTTONOUS PRIVILEGE AND LACK SO MUCH IN WHAT THEY INTEND TO DISPLAY. HOWEVER THEY ARE A VESSEL IN WHICH SOME IDEAS CAN BE EXPRESSED AND THEY ARE ALL WE HAVE

‚Ä¢	WHAT IS TRULY BEAUTIFUL AND HAPPENS AMONGST FRIENDS IS THE WORDLESS ABSTRACT EXHANGE OF IDEAS‚Ä¶.THIS IS PURE AND COMES WITHOUT ANY OF THE CONNOTATION OR PRECONCEPTIONS THAT WORDS MIGHT CARRY WITH THEM

‚Ä¢	WHEN ONE USES WORDS HE MUST USE THEM CAREFULLY AND CHOOSE VERY DELICATELY WHAT HE SAYS BECAUSE YOU CAN NEVER BE QUITE SURE HOW SOMEONE ELSE WILL UNDERSTAND WORDS THAT YOUR INTENTION WAS QUITE DIFFERENT

‚Ä¢	SPEAK CAREFULLY, DO WORK WITH INTENT AND SHOW OTHERS THE WAY

‚Ä¢	IF ANYONE COMES ASKING FOR HELP

‚Ä¢	SO SAD TO SEE MAN AS SEEING HIMSELF AS COMPLETELY DIVIDED FROM THE WORLD AROUND HIM SO MUCH SO THAT HE NEEDS DRUGS MUSHROOMS THC LSD ANYTHING TO FULLY REALIZE THIS IS WHERE HE CAMES FROM BELONGS GREW UP AND WILL DIE

‚Ä¢	BUT EVERYONE HAS HOPE AND MUSHROOMS AND WALK IN THE WOODS CAN DO A WORLD OF GOOD FOR MOST PEOPLE

‚Ä¢	COEXISTANCE WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE SO DIRECTLY TIED UP AND SUBSUMED WITH THE WORLD OF FORMS THE WORLD THAT WE ALL KNOW IS SO FAKE AND ILLUSORY AND ALL A BIG LAUGHING HAHA JOKE GAME COEXISTANCE AND LEARNING HOW TO SOCIALLY BE AWARE OF BOTH OTHERS AND YOURSELF IS THE KEY TO MODERN LIVING

‚Ä¢	IT IS THE MOST DIFFICULT TASK TO MANAGE AND TRY TO BALANCE A DEEP WORLDLY UNDERSTANDING OF NATURE AND OUR CONNECTION TO IT AND THE  CAPITALISTIC UNDERSTANDING THAT WE ARE IN SOME WAY INDEBTED TO IT AND SHOULD PAY TO USE IT

‚Ä¢	AND IT STRESSES PEOPLE OUT AND IT CHANGES THE WAY THEY THINK THEY ARE NOT PURE, THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS TO PEOPLE. ITS SAD, BUT ALL YOU CAN DO IS BE AS RESPECTFUL AS POSSIBLE AND SHOW GRATITUDE FOR ALL THAT THEY HAVE GIVEN U THEY ALL COME FROM AND WILL GO TO THE SAME PLACE AS US

‚Ä¢	TEACHING PEOPLE PERSPECTIVE IS IMPOSSIBLE (WIHTOUT PERHAPS THE AID OF PSYCHEDELICS) BUT ALL YOU CAN DO IS TREAT THEM WITH TOTAL DIGNITY AND RESPECT ANDPUT OUT POSITIVE ENERGY

‚Ä¢	OBVIOUSLY ALL PROBLEMS IN THE WORLD ARE FAKE AND CREATED WITH WORDS AND POWER THAT DOESN‚ÄôT EVEN MEAN ANYTHING THEY CAN BE SOLVED WITH FACE TO FACE ONE ON ONE NATURAL COMPASSION WHICH WE ALL SHOULD EMBODY

‚Ä¢	EVERYONE SHOULD TAKE MUSHROOMS AND WALK IN THE WOODS

1368973847.0,1emqnp,My trip last night. What a roller coaster,Balltan,16,1,4,"Trip.
Catoctin mountains in Maryland . I have had many experiences with mushrooms and many different type of experiences . Before last night
Me and my two buddies spent the day hiking with plans to end the day back at the campsite with dinner and mushrooms. So around 10 pm we take some. Small doses. A cap here a stem there and over the course of the next 2 hours we sat around the fire and howled laughing . Haven't laughed that hard in ages. Truly a great feeling to be with friends that don't get to hang out as much as we did in the old days . As the night goes on we become a little more adventurous and travel outside the campsite into the complete darkness of the mountain. This is where I started seeing some visuals. I could see their bodies outlines in the darkness but their faces were black. This black void let my imagination come up with some pretty freaky but still fun faces. We wandered around the mountain campground admiring our campfire from afar and how the light was reflecting off of the trees and smoke. We made a couple trips through the night from the fire back to our little adventure. So one last time we take another dose of shrooms. This time a big thick blue stem. And this is where things go from a light hearted good trippy time to a complete mind fuck. 1 of my friends went to bed so it left just my one friend and I. I suddenly began getting this anxious feeling. An un easy feeling. I knew something was up. Then I began yawning and getting tired myself so I closed my eyes...... I will do my best at explaining this... When my eyes were closed I didn't just see darkness... I saw colors... Ugly colors... In odd creepy spider leg shapes. Then I'd see structures.. The perfect way to describe what I was seeing in my eyes was something from a damn tool video. So scary to me that I couldn't keep my eyes closed I had to open them.... But then the blanket of being so tired floated over me and was trying to lead me back to closing my eyes. I was in a hardcore scary catch 22.. So tired and needed to sleep. When I'd try and sleep I'd see horrible things. something in my mind was telling me there was an artist in my brain creating these images and it was a female. I really started bugging because time started moving slower and slower. My other buddy goes to bed to I'm left by myself . I lay down in the tent and try sleeping. Same thing. Then I open my eyes. This time I'm in the tent and it's pitch black. The fire was dying out. My phone was almost dead. I'd soon be with out light . My only source of reality I was holding on to. I go to my car and plug my phone in and call my cousin. We both had this exact experience prior . Last time I just bugged out for hours. I wasn't doing it this time. I was a lot calmer then previously. I tell him my situation and he talks to me. Explains how I control what light my mind sees things in. Gave me a speech about how I needed to go back in the tent and turn this ship around. Stop panicking. Stop thinking about the scary things I'd see. And take advantage of this. After 15 minutes I decide to go back into the tent and face my fears. I laid there. Laughed, snoopys friend. Yellow with hints of different colors and tentacles... These tentacles were just spinning and twirling. And I said to myself .. So this is what it's like if I don't resist... And the yellow creature smiled.and nodded. And then it was on. Kaleidoscopic hearts twirling into each other . Colors just smashing and rolling . Purely beautiful and blissful. It was right there where I learned that I'm in control of the positive and negative thoughts I'm projecting and if I just let the shrooms do what they do and don't fight them , I can enjoy my trip unlike anything I've ever experienced before.

**Answer to your ""Does this look like X grams to you?"":**

There is no good way to determine the weight of shrooms by eyesight alone. **Your best bet is to get a scale** so that you can weigh it out properly. The potency can also highly variable from shroom to shroom

**However**, or motivation to go out and buy a scale of their own. For that reason I have created a table below which you can eyeball for yourself what you think is about equal.

Note that wet shrooms are about 10 times as heavy as dry shrooms. In other words

I pulverized 3g of my B+ in a coffee grinder and stirred that with the juice of one whole lemon. Let that sit for about 25 minutes and topped it off with a little sugar and some pulpy orange juice. 

I saved 1g of them aside to munch on after, but this way far more intense than any other time. I went through a good 20-30 minute period of panic, which has never happened to me before. By the end of the first hour I was absolutely fine and on cloud 9. Very introspective and the moonlit clouds with snow falling were beyond humbling. 

I'd recommend at least trying the lemon tek to compare with a regular dose. I felt like it made the trip start far faster than other methods

1358785257.0,16zsks,"Trip Report: ""Pink Buffalo Fucked Me Up!""",champinonesmagicales,21,11,18,"Hy guys and gals. Last night I chopped up about 83 grams of fresh PB from my first flush... I split that between Myself

Our setting was great. Back yard bonfire just chilling around the fire drinking tea on a cool evening in the mountains.

Onset was fast. Felt a body buzz before I even finished my cup. By the time I was finished I was coming up fast. Started to see CEVs within 15 mins. By 45 mins hilarity ensued. We were laughing about everything hysterically. I was hoping the neighbors wouldn't hear us. 

By an hour my CEV's were incredible. Twisting and turning rivers of geometric shapes. Universes of depth. Vast space with shapes traveling throughout. Twisting and spinning psychedelic floral patterns that would spin and then stop instantly. I was in another world!

The whole night I just kept thinking about how fucked up I was. How different these were from the 30 grams I ate of B+. B+ was really mellow. Very introspective. Very philosophical. 
PB was pure psychedelics! I didn't have any revelations because my brain was so overloaded with shapes and swirls and visual information.

I stood in the kitchen for about 10 mins stairing at our flourecent lights. The were breathing like crazy. Almost pulsating... Then my gf made me come back out by the fire. 

As the fire died and I started to get cold I talked her into going into the house. We had to round up our dogs that were also outside with us but they would not come inside! It was like they knew something was off about us. They seemed very on edge. When we got them inside it was chaos for me. I was on the verge of passing out I was tripping so hard and my dog was whining and licking my face. It was away too much for me. I started to see condensation droplets and sweat dripping when I closed my eyes. It was like heat

After I laid in my room for a bit kind of freaking out that I had taken too much I almost got online to see how to come down. I turned the PC on and sat there but I couldn't really work the computer. I turned it off and laid back down and started talking sense into myself. 

My gf put on some electric sheep and I let that ride me out of the trip. We were listening to the radiohead station on pandora one and that really was great. 

So it was weird because we were thinking our roomie was missing out on these visualizations and right was we said that she knocked on the door of our bedroom. We thought it was so crazy we had to let her in even thought we were naked under the covers.

And then we watched until the end. The song and the visualizations ended at the same time and before it did

All I kept thinking was that with B+ we separated from reality but were still in that reality floating above it. With PB it was like I got into a rocket ship and blasted myself into deep space. 

I know everyone says ""a cube is a cube"" but I am just going to have to disagree after this experience. I've taken roughly the same amount the same way with the same people and it was NOTHING like this. And it affected us all the same both times. We all thought B+ was very mellow and calm and we all were tripping balls having crazy visuals last night on PB.

After Mixing about 4.1g with some orange juice we start feeling the usual stomach tension. We decide we want to build a fire but instead of buying firewood from the convenience store we decide to go forage it. We start walking the trail hoping to run into some firewood. We both start tripping as we begin walking the trail. 

We found ourselves mesmerized by the beauty of everything around us. Everything was so calm and relaxing; the boats riding in the distance. The gentle wind animating the trees

It's at this time that we have a very honest talk about the past years of our lives and how much we've experienced since last summer. We talk about our shortcomings, which leads to us not really feeling shameful about our past, but rather eager to do better in the future. 

Me personally

At this time my mood is just extreme happiness as I am surrounded by beauty. This whole time as we're walking the trial my life feels like a Wes Anderson film, and just being a nice person that can make others smile.

I realize that I likely won't feel as euphoric everyday as I did today. But still

Used one syringe between 10 jars

1341122018.0,vvbk0,My first trip outside of time.,Andeepanda,10,2,14,"So just the other day I had finally set out to take my shrooms I got off my green dealer. Picked up an 8th and saw that as being a good start between two people. I had been reading up on how to take them

It was about 11pm when we arrived at our destination amongst some college bleachers but my friend got nervious since she had never done them before so she wanted me to take my half first to see what it be like. After about half an hour of consuming my portion with some M&amp;Ms we saw no change

Half was into the walk we ended up by a tree nursery that was on a very dimly lit street which made the night sky the most spectacular back drop that triggered the biggest smile on my face. I began telling her that I loved how she painted because that was her mind setting forward an image to share with the world. Then I got into the idea that she not obey street signs when they have no rule over us. Slowly the other portion I took was sinking in.

We entered a very dark street covered in the shade of trees which is where I believe my trip peaked. Within the shade of the night sky I began wanting to tell her how the night felt like my home, but our bodys needed to remain in the physical realm to express love, because everything is love. 

I even had a flash back from being on the said street once before but there were signs I had to see and for some reason the idea of a fish came to mind, and phish. I stayed away from the concepts for as long as I could but then I began to hate time again, until I understood time as the universes piece of paper. You cant share every idea the way we could if we were telepathic, and so with our limitations we need time (paper) to share our ideas (dreams). 

Further down the street I thought of myself as a needle on a record player

Further still, and spirit and we are all connected. Then the concept of adam and eve came into play. I thought women could not understand what a man could. That because she was created of a rib all she knew was beauty, and I could not create anything more beautiful then her. After that I remember referencing lennon and yoko, but its all fuzzy in my memory. I do recall tossing my glasses to the floor and saying i did not need them, as well as wanting to talk to a gentlemen cleaning the streets at what was now sometime round 3am.

Once we continued back to the car I really lost it. I felt like time no longer exsisted as I hated it so much. I felt like she had to leave me behind because all that was left was me making my moves forward. Every place around me was the same and nothing mattered but going forward. She would not leave me so she physically had to put me in the car. ""Do you want to go home"" she asked... ""I want to die"" I said. 

The whole drive back I kept closing my eyes and seeing hexagons of a raindow tint pusing

In her bed I bagan to try to communicate to all those I had lost in my past telepathically. My father, and a former flaim all in there respective times. The last one was me asking for my brother in which at the same time she had called him on my phone. His voice brought my comfort back and I slowly began to realize where I was and what I had been doing. I felt so out of it, and to make things worse, in my fury of just moving forward and go go go mentality I pissed myself on her bed :/ .... 

I had kept my friend up for hours on end and when I finally asked what time it was 7am had just hit. So with all of this I will just learn to control my dosage next time and really just grab a grip on reality. I honestly felt in control of the cosmos but when you wake up pissed....  you know you were just tripping.

TL;DR
I, went mildly crazy, and crated a concept of God that empowers me and everyone around me.

[First harvest(part of)](http://i.imgur.com/sjNjU)

I actually took a timelapse from start till first harvest, dried down to 7g. 

I'm at what I'd probably say is the happiest I've ever been in my life (awesome job/girlfriend/everything) so I was not scared at all and took 3.5g. I'm ~170lbs male. My girlfriend (100lbs)

Here's the extremely short version of what happened: 2 hours in I was feeling pretty ""jolly"" and ""light"" but that's about it. My girlfriend was tripping balls. I decided to smoke smoke weed as I was somewhat disappointed. I'm not certain of what effects it had but if I had to use one word to describe the night it would be ""extreme concentration"" and raised senses. My vision was perfect

At one point I talked to my GF (who I don't think had any idea what I was saying) for what felt like an eternity on one specific subject without drifting off at all, which of course led into the whole ""I'm going to die, go insane, never going to return to normal blah blah"", there's a lot of detail missing here because it would take 2 pages to explain the reasoning behind it. Anyway. Things obviously returned to normal the next day.

After mulling this over for a few days, knowing what I then knew (I'm not going to die) and without smoking weed. Second flush only produced 2.5g dried which I took. The experience was similar (without the panic), I had EXTREME concentration and was not distracted by anything. I tried really hard to ""let go"" and had mild success staring at dots on the floor, with things ""wobbling"" considerably more than before but that's that. I tried sensory deperavation (earplugs, dark room) and had no success. I definitely felt ""weird"" and again ""light"", and extremely relaxed physically and concentrated mentally. In fact I laid in bed for at least 3 hours trying to sleep without any luck because I just couldn't stop thinking. Finally fell asleep at around 5am, took shrooms at 9pmish.

So I'm wondering... Wtf? Where are my awesome visuals and ""trips""? :P And from what I've read

I don't know if this is related, I guess it's almost been a year now. On and off. At first, it was the typical weed experience. Munchies and uncontrolable lolz. Then in the last 2-3 months it's started drifting towards the same type of hyper concentration that I experienced on shrooms. In fact, this entire grow was completed while high, and I couldn't have done it this well sober. 

Do I just need.. more?

What I'm also interested in knowing is whether there is a relation between high from weed and ""high"" from shrooms? Because it felt very similar to me

Anecdotally- have any of you that partake in shrooms often noticed any effect on your skin? 

Scientifically- it makes sense that it would be effective

Experimentation- I have a friend who has been having severe bouts of acne for the last few months.  She is the sort that would likely agree to this, do you think it would have any effect on skin condition?

I'm curious and if this sounds plausible I'd like to broach it with her and send her some so that we can test it.  I'll be seeing her over Christmas (perfect time for clearer skin) and we can discuss the effects she's seen.  I'd like to eventually write a paper on my findings.

The sensation only lasts a moment, followed by an even faster one. So the pulses pick up in frequency, usually about 4-5 in total (I usually jerk myself out of it at this point). 

This feeling is accompanied by massive nerve surge through my body. The only thing I can relate it to is when you're falling asleep and you're muscles all spasm at once. Except with your nerves. I can feel it start in my head/neck and work through my entire body. Feels kinda good honestly.

Anyways.

Some information about where these mushrooms were picked and the weather conditions today to a few days prior along with some pictures. I tried to capture the top of the cap

####Location

I live in Lafayette

Getting into specifics, if that's relevant at all.

####Weather

It rained for quite a bit on Thursday

####Pictures

I tried my best to get a clear pictures that captured anything important. If the pictures are of poor quality or not useful I apologize.

[Picture 1](http://i.imgur.com/dAVMwAv.jpg) and [Picture 2](http://i.imgur.com/vAaWsvs.jpg)

You'll notice some of them are crushed a bit. After picking them I put them in my pocket and went to herd cattle (seriously). That's why they got smushed. 

Now according to [this](http://www.shroomery.org/8461/Which-psilocybin-mushrooms-grow-wild-in-my-area) the mushrooms that grow wild in my area are:

#

* Gymnopilus junonius

* Panaeolus cinctulus

* Panaeolus cyanescens

* Psilocybe caerulescens

* Psilocybe cubensis

I looked up pictures of these for comparison, who knows?

In the drying process

Location: Nanaino

I did not know you couldn't take a spore print once mushrooms are dried, and not bruising. So we could possibly consider that as a spore print. Which would mean ""Dark Blue"". From what I remember seeing as a deposit in the coffee filter when I was drying, ""greyish"" could describe the spore print as well.

So last night I birthed some jars and 8 out of 10 of the jars had began to [fruit prematurely](http://i.imgur.com/WHe7Y.jpg) in the jar. Dunking these cakes would kill the premature fruits so I harvested them and they weighed out to 11 grams wet weight. 

I prepared them as described above not expecting anything to really happen. I have never dosed so low before but then again they were fresh and taken as tea so I really didn't know what to expect.
My gf and I went to see our favorite local band and I wasn't feeling much of anything but then again I just had 3 pieces of pizza and a salad

I found myself hyper attracted to females. I didn't want to do anything with these girls. The attraction was not sexual in any way but I just wanted to stare and take them all in. It was at this point I thought that I was a total creeper.

Everyone in the crowd seemed to be a TV/movie character of some sort. Probably because it was a rockabilly show but I thought everyone was so theatrical
Perhaps the most profound (and admittedly bizarre) thought I kept having was that I did not grow mushrooms for myself but the mushrooms were using me to manifest their effects. They needed me to grow and consume them. They did not exist for my enjoyment but rather I existed so they could survive and be consumed. I kept feeling as if I was on a separate layer of reality that was pulling away from actual reality. It felt as if I was from another universe observing the people of this universe. If anyone has ever watch the tv show 'Fringe' I would say I felt a lot like 'an observer.' That there were 2 universes and mushrooms were the key to visit the other side. This is when I came up with the theory that the show Fringe is actually based on a psychedelic trip. Walter is constantly referencing LSD and in the last season we discovered a parallel universe where everything was the same but slightly different. 
I came home after and played with my dog

All in all I was extremely surprised the effect of 11 grams fresh had on me. It was extremely profound and controlled. Except at the beginning when it my chest was heavy and I thought I may have been poisoned.

It was initially a fun trip, I couldn't hear myself speak English. I would talk to my friends and they would understand me, but I wouldn't understand myself. It's like when you tell someone that you're going to the bathroom. They hear you say ""I'm going to the bathroom"" and you hear your own voice say the same thing. However, when I told them ""I'm going to the bathroom"", I heard my own voice say some type of absolute gibbrish. It wasn't a language that exists but rather it was completely made up and composed of random sounds and words that I've heard or said throughout my life, even going as far as syllables of some words being combined with others to create new ones. The only way I knew that I wasn't quite going crazy was that I had to be certain in what I was saying. Even though I wouldn't hear myself saying ""I'm going to the bathroom"", based on how my friends reacted to what I said, in fact

Flashforward:

Last night was my first time doing shrooms since the 6g dosage. I did 3g because I didn't want to have the same effects as last time. However, these stars look radical,"" but in my head I would hear ""kingluxen something seomthing (mario coin pickup sound)."" Again, it didn't last long, but it was still strange. Thankfully I wasn't freaked out because this had happened before, but I was still wondering why and how this was happening.

Any ideas as to what this occurrence is?

1) My local shop has a few different spores in, Ecuador, they had a few more but I didn't catch the names (Golden teacher was one of them but that was sold out), all of these were in 10cc syringes. Is any strain easier to grow than another? Is any strain noticeably more potent?  
2) Like I said, will this give me mushrooms coming out the ass?  
3) If I have a big pot and boil the jars as seen in the pf tek vids is this sufficient? I don't have a pressure cooker / canner and if I don't have to spend the money on it I'd rather not..but if it produces noticeably better results I'll buy it.

Having read some pretty good things about them (and to further simplify the process since it's my first time), possibly relocating it after the first picking. The rest of the bags I'm going to use as media to spawn to bulk)

Here's the layout I'm planning on following for the bulk:
Innoc 2-3 mad bags
Wait until the bags are 100% colonized (going to just follow the mad bag instructions until I switch to bulk)
Wait another week (is this step necessary if you're spawning to bulk
Prepare coir (http://www.shroomery.org/forums/showflat.php/Number/11916595#11916595)
Prepare monotob (http://www.shroomery.org/forums/showflat.php/Number/14649819)
Place in 12/12 light, wait until they're ready to pick.

So my questions are:
Will 3 mad bags be enough to create spawn for a 30 qt tote like [this](http://www.target.com/p/rubbermaid-revelations-30-qt-latching-tote-purple/-/A-14051274#?lnk=sc_qi_detaillink)?
Can the mad bags even be used to spawn to bulk? I assume they can since I've read that you can do this with PF tek cakes; I don't see why it would be different.
The aforementioned ""Is this step necessary?"" 
How do you do flushes with a monotub? Or is it more of a ""one and done"" thing?
And did I miss anything else?

Many people also use grain in their jars instead of brown rice flour.  Also

Why is the pf tek so slow? Well

What is spawning to bulk? Well, or coco coir and vermiculite which after pasteurization (you can either do it or not depending on your type of substrate) you add your spawn to. 

I see a lot of threads here about the PF Tek and they are all good and everything, whether or not you are using multispore or a liquid culture, incubation temps, Relative Humidity.

Now that I mentioned Liquid Culture... I should say that if you buy spore syringes off the internet

Some people also use agar (many recipes, then take your spores from your prints and transfer them to your agar, then once the agar is colonized, you can cut wedges of the agar and transfer that to grains. Instead of making a spore syringe from your wild print, you can get it to colonize on agar and if say the agar has contaminates, you can carefully cut away the healthy mycelium from the contaminated stuff and then try with another plate to see if you can isolate the good stuff from the bad. 

Also I should say, I just wanted to spread some knowledge. 

Here are some good OMC's that I like to use

shroomery.org
mycotopia.net

I'm pretty sure I got to experience ego death, and the next day I started reading about production. I've decided me and these shrooms are going to be best friends forever.

I ordered some spores, and 30 more to noc up next time the wife heads out for an entire day.

I've been extremely discrete, so I plan on producing a metric fuckton this summer, and discretely storing for as long as possible. 

Here's the methods I've found so far that appeal to me to me.

1373654141.0,1i64ay,My first real dose,Greenpinky,5,0,4,"**Warning: Wall of text**     
Tl;dr. Good trip, would do again.

So a bit of backstory. I was raised religious and anti-drug, and also that I don't trust ""man-made"" drugs. So after I tried some Changa, my eyes were more open and I became interested in Shrooms.

Even though there are plenty of cows, and combining it with trees made trees seem brand new, but i didn't get what I was expecting from shrooms

Flash forward to yesterday. I didn't plan on taking them when I woke up, and put on the regular show for an hour as they started to kick in. I just ate them plain, no tek, slightly empty stomach. Regular show got abnormally funnier than usual, even episodes I had already saw before. (I didn't giggle barely at all the entire trip though). I'm starting to feel it as I puff on some trees, and decide to eat another dose... about .75. And it starts to kick in. I watch my cat, and when she breathes I see each individual hair reflect the light. I watched them all move in unison, and I decided to see what it was like outside.

I'm an art major, and everywhere I looked my thought was ""That is art"" just that everything could have been its own piece of work, just pure beauty. Was so cool

Now a third thing, my cat, I could read from my phone, and at the same time, i was hearing music. Not like melodys, or piano, but I was listening to songs that I both knew, drums

I ended up eating another .75 around 7:30

I didn't have any auditory or visual hallucinations, so I think I'll try the lemon tek next time, as well as upping my dose.

My only complaint is that, which is understandable. it just feels like I got a shit night of sleep haha.

Spore print is light brown. This is in northeastern US. I've heard the manure was from pigs but can't confirm that. The smell is unremarkable. I can also examine other features if anyone has followup questions. It seems like the caps start out concave and then turn up with age.

So two weeks ago was my first try. I crunched 2g straight up and waited... and felt n.o.t.h.i.n.g. No effects. I was kind of bummed

So yesterday was going to be my day. I ate sparingly to keep my stomach mostly empty; my last meal was half a meager peanut butter sandwich, poured a cup onto the finely minced shrooms, let it steep for 10 minutes, strained and sipped. Then I did a second infusion, which I drank and then ate the solids, just in case to avoid missing any goodies.

The effects? ... :/

I felt:

* mild body high

* enhanced mood

* seemingly increased visual acuity

* somewhat clumsy

* at peak (around 7:30pm)

I suffer from [Cluster Headaches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_headache) and a proven medicine for this is psilocybin. So i've been eating Psilocybe Semilanceata given to me by very nice friends. I was going to pick some myself this autumn to get me through the winter but i failed miserably with the mission.

My friends doesn't do shrooms anymore

So my solution is quite simply to start growing myself. 


Sorry for the long intro

I'm going to try growing some Cubensis using the PF TEK method listed in the sidebar. I'm a total newbie and notorious for killing plants

I understand that a completely sterile enviroment is recommended for growing and here is where the problem lies. My wife and I have two small dogs that shed hair like crazy. Does this mean that I am screwed from the get go and should give up? Exactly how sterile is ""sterile"" when it really comes down to it? The only room i can keep dog free is a very small room where we keep cleaning supplies and the vacuum cleaner. 
It will suffice for storage when all the work has been done but I can not do the work itself in there.

I found on ebay this product ( http://www.ebay.com/itm/Magic-Mountain-Mushroom-Grain-spawn-6-lbs-grow-bag-kit-/170595313683?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item27b845e813 )- it comes in three varieties- rye berries mushroom spawn, 5/6lb, 10lb packs, and honestly I'm not sure of a few things.


*what size bag i need per syringe I buy (would a one-pound bag and one syringe be a good mix

*am I missing anything, dose/reseal and wait to open the bag again once I see pins?

*would a one lb bag and one syringe make multiple flushes?  would it make more sense to buy a 5 or 10 lb bag

*would it make sense to buy multiple smaller bags and make different cultures with the same or different syringe types?

*would the rye berry or the grain substrate be a better choice

*after a harvest would I want to dunk it somehow


The brand has a very high rating (Positive Feedback:  100%

1333823035.0,ry4fa,Reporting back findings from my research,TriggerNutzofDOOM,6,1,2,"Last night my better half and I embarked on a path to seek out further knowledge of the effects of P. Cubes. We each took a dose of about 4 grams each on an empty stomach then sat back to record our data. 

30 minutes: There was a strong sense of calm and relaxation. My partner noted her headache's strength downgrading to a lower pain scale. I had a tingling sensation that encompassed my brain and slight prickling feeling on my arms. Here I should add that this was all on the positive side.

60 Minutes: My partner has a deeper sense of relaxation and a heightened sense of euphoria. Headache completely gone and also felt a tingling sensation in her frontal lobe. All positive. Much laughter followed.

80 Minutes: I feel at ease and also have a strong euphoric rush. We head to the bedroom to further investigate our surroundings. A note I'd like to add here: At this point I find myself breaking out into spontaneous laughter. Everything is 100% more amusing.

115 Minutes: We find ourselves staring at an elaborate blanket that is on our bed. The patterns seem to float as if a wave and there are shapes and figures we've never noticed before. The best way I can describe the visual is how you would see heat waves in the summer looking off in the distance. 

Lost track of time: Immensely hungry and having the realization that I am very much in control of my thoughts. We are both discovering that we can still function somewhat normally despite the fact that I am still laughing at random intervals. My head seems to be racing with lots of thoughts and new ideas. My partner is overwhelmed by a soothing drowsiness that finally sets her off to slumber peacefully. I manage to stay up a little longer and ponder many things. My brain is in overdrive while it processes all the amazing things going on inside my body. This is all very positive indeed. My legs felt like hey were steadily paddling through water as I waved them back and forth under my blanket. Finally

We both wake up with absolutely no side effects. Neither one of us felt physically ill or had any negative reactions. The ""come down"" was almost nonexistent. Unless

Conclusion: In our professional opinion this was by far one of the safest forms of altered mental states one can attain using natural growth provided by mother nature.

I've been really enjoying fiddling with my vegetable/herb garden this summer. Not a lot of goods but I still enjoy it for some reason. I'm sure it'll do better next year with some preperation and experience under my belt.

Anyway. I love white button mushrooms (Agaricus bisporus) and I've been reading up on how to grow them. I know most posts here are for psilocybin muchrooms but I figured I'd give it a try anyway.

I have a ""plan"" in mind based on the various stuff that I've read and I want to see if makes any sense or if there are any glaring holes in it.


**Spawn**: I bought [THIS]( http://www.ebay.com/itm/190505148271?ssPageName=STRK:MEWNX:IT&amp;_trksid=p3984.m1439.l2649#ht_765wt_950) on ebay and I'm awaiting delivery. My understanding is that I'll either want to sow this directly on my substrate? do I mix it or just sow on top?

Side-Question: If I were to do PF-Tek (not suitable for this type I know) with spawn, culture, prints, etc. Am I correct in assuming that pre made syringes are just a mix of spawn and distilled water? 



**Substrate:** I don't want to pay $30 for big bag of sterilized manure online that needs to be used within a couple of weeks. I want to start small. I'm planning to get composted manure at home depot and microwave nuke it. I know this is not proper sterilization but people seem to have some luck with it so I figure it'll be a good first step. If it fails first try I'm going to see about sterilizing it somehow. 


**Casing:** I don't really understand the concept of casing in relation to Agaricus bisporus. I have seen peat moss mentioned (readibly available in home depot) but I don't really know how to use it. Do I jsut put it on top after the colonization is finished?



**Temperature control:** My apartment is plenty warm (I live in Texas) for colonization


**Humidity control**: Not really sure on this one either but I think I'll manage somehow. I'm really obsessed with misting my plants when I'm at home. Also have some plexiglass DIY knowledge if I need to make a terrarium. 


**Housing**: Was considering just using something like [THIS](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-k2YhGIZ-f-s/TkbQ3DY-WjI/AAAAAAAAKJg/mSEKontb9TE/s720/IMG_20110813_142502.jpg) although perhaps a few inches taller for easier humidity control. I have some silocone sealant if it does not appear to be somewhat air tight.

All you will need is: Ground Rice/Barley

1. Create a mush with the ground rice and water, you dont want it sopping wet. Alternatively, remove the grain from the microwave before it becomes overly saturated.

2. Using a sterilized utensil

3. After a couple of days

4. Boil the hpoo up on a stove and afterwards squeeze out as much water as you can - I personally like to leave the hpoo out in the sun to dry off a bit. You know the hpoo is optimally damp when you put it in a container and you see almost no moisture collecting on the walls. Then prepare another small plate this time with a shallow layer of hpoo.

5. From your grain plate that is now growing mold, and transfer those spots to the plate of hpoo. It should look like this: http://imgur.com/mqmlmUY 

6. Eventually these small white dots will spread and take over the plate of hpoo

7. Once it takes over the plate and looks thick and healthy, you'll probably find some fatties pokin out a month later.

Horse manure is excellent as a substrate since it is incredibly contamination resistant and fungus thrives on it.
