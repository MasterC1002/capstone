1. **Decklists, ""Would this work, is this good, what do you recommend?"". Not only that, but I'm seeing non-competitive or budget decks being voted up and discussed. I often see good advice being downvoted, and bad advice being actively considered. I might be mistaken, but I never considered spikes a place to *feel good* or *be nice* - I saw it as the harsh but necessary advice. ""Your deck sucks

2. **Community base seems divided.** I feel like there are two parties here. There is a large influx of players who aren't that good but are looking to actively improve their game or get valuable advice from us, in turn, becoming bitter and irritated and downvoting the crap out of everything. I've literally walked into one topic about a boros deck that was voted to 0, with the top voted comment mentioning that this type of post doesn't belong here and to post in the Critique Thread - and then, I've walked into a nearly identical topic about a boros deck that is voted to the front and a post suggesting the Critique Thread is at negative. Can we make up our freaking minds? What is this subreddit for? Does anyone know anymore?

Here's the problem: this really isn't what this subreddit is about. We're here for competitive magic. That can include strategy tips, event reports, top 8 rundowns, and yes, the occasional competitive brew is fine. However, the subreddit loses its meaning. Even worse, it should not be because we want each other to tune up our decks that we know are less than optimal. It should be because we have tested the deck competitively, and want to share your success with others. Of course

1374601691.0,1iwb7r,[Standard] BUG Superfriends,NESSNESSNESSNESS,111,17,66,"**Introduction**


Hello all, and I’ve been prepping for it hard on cockatrice and by lurking on this subreddit and mtgsalvation. For around 4-5 months (Once I learned that I didn’t really enjoy playing aggro all that much), I’ve been trying to pilot various BUG decks. It started with BUG Delver, in the weeks before RTR rotated. Due to some problems with the Jund matchup (Olivia Voldaren was a nightmare for the deck) which was quite popular at my LGS, I switched it to BUG Control. Over the months, I’ve been adding more and more planeswalkers, until I finally gave in and went all out, I’ve been tweaking the deck almost non-stop for the month


So, it’s the shard with the best planeswalkers currently in the format, Sorin and Domri notwithstanding (who don’t really fit in a Superfriends decks in the first place). Black, Green, and Blue are the colors that give us Lilianna of the Veil, Jace Architect of Thougt, Garruk Relentless, and Vraska (as sideboard tech). The reason that we want to play planeswalkers is simple
	

Of course, we miss out on the aforementioned Sorin, Lingering Souls, and the big one: Supreme Verdict. While we do have a board wipe in black (Mutilate), it’s tough to use in three colors. Much of the mana base we’re using is built around the problem that the swamp requirement that the card comes with. On the other hand, because we have mutilate we hit some creatures that wouldn’t regularly die with our mutilates. If for some reason we see a Predator Ooze (becoming more popular) or a Falkenrath Aristocrat, our trusty mutilate will do things no Verdict could ever do. Overall, and I’ll now tell you why.


**Decklist**

2 Far // Away

2 Liliana of the Veil

3 Jace

2 Garruk Relentless	

2 Tamiyo

3 Scavenging Ooze

4 Thragtusk

2 Putrefy

4 Breeding Pool

2 Hinterland Harbor

2 Woodland Cemetery

3 Farseek

4 Swamp

2 Snapcaster Mage

1 AEtherling

2 Doom Blade

2 Psychic Strike

4 Mutilate

1 Progenitor Mimic

1 Syncopate

*Sideboard*

2 Pithing Needle

 1 Progenitor Mimic

 2 Abrupt Decay

2 Vraska the Unseen

2 Lifebane Zombie

2 Duress

2 Appetite for Brains

2 Ratchet Bomb


**Planeswalkers**


Liliana of the Veil – Our resident black walker can be summed up as simply extremely threatening. Her sacrifice is obviously good against a variety of decks

Jace, I like +1ing this guy on the turn he comes down for future protection. If I don’t or I really need an answer, I just go for the -2 to try and get what I need. Not much to say, as I just like to keep this guy as a recurring fact or fiction. Also hoses souls and assemble the legion, which is incredibly important.

Garruk Relentless – Simply excellent in the midrange and aggro matchups. In midrange he takes out mana dorks for our sac effects, lest he flips. Awesome card in the deck.

Tamiyo, drawing a ton of huge board states that just swung (the new green aggro deck). Simple, but effective.

**Creatures**

Scavenging Ooze – Obvious include. Hoses Junk Rites

Thragtusk – Value town. Stabilises in a lot of different matchups

Progenitor Mimic – I have 1 in the mainboard and 1 in the sideboard, he’s a solid finisher. Against Jund and Junk Midrange, you can copy a Thrag, AoS or Huntmaster to turn around a game. I run one of him mainboard because I simply expect to see a lot of Jund midrange, and I like him against that deck.

Snapcaster Mage – I’m running him as a 2-of and not a 3-of simply because I don’t like having two of him and no instants or sorceries in my opening hand. Put simply

Aetherling – Finisher for stalled board states

**Instants/Sorceries**

Doom Blade – My go-to 2 mana removal spell. I used to have 3 of them

Putrefy – Targeted non-black creature/artifact removal. The artifact mode hasn’t come up too often

Psychic Strike – My main counter spell. Mostly running it due to dissipate being hard on mana at double blue

Far and Away – Another good removal spell. The sacrifice is good for Hexproof

Syncopate – As earlier stated

Farseek – Running as a 3 of as I wanted more removal. Pretty integral to the deck

Mutilates – Our go to board wipe. Thankfully

**Land**

My land is mostly a standard mana base

**Sideboard**

Pithing Needle – A very versatile card. In the Esper matchup I like brining it in against Jace

Progenitor Mimic – I’ve already gone over why this card is good. I basically side it in

Abrupt Decay – Has a few uses. Deals well with aggro decks, and deals well with any deck that relies on O ring or D Sphere to remove my walkers.

Vraska the Unseen – Side it in when I need intangible removal. Doesn’t hit lands, and the ability to remove planeswalkers) make her worth the spot. This is probably one of the cards I’m least sure about because of Acidic Slime potentially being better (I do think Tamiyo does a decent job at land hate already though).

Lifebane Zombie – The list of standard playable targets this guy hits is absurd, which is amazing. His Intimidate ability has paid off well too.

Duress – Side it in in the matchups with not a lot of creatures (Esper being a big one). The uses here are fairly obvious

Appetite for Brains – Side it in in the matchups where there are a ton of CMC 4 or greater

Ratchet Bomb – Fairly recent addition based on what I saw from Richmond. Notably, and a lot of the two drops in R/G Aggro. I can also pump it up in R/G aggro once I’ve stabilised just in case a Burning Earth comes down. Considering removing it for Curse of Death’s Hold for the matchups I talked about before, but I feel Ratchet Bomb is slightly better.

**Matchups**

**Jund**

-2 Doom Blade	

-2 Mutilate

-1 Jace

+1 Progenitor Mimic

+2 Appetite for Brains

+2 Lifebane Zombie


I feel I have a good matchup against Jund (won many matches in testing against it). Progenitor Mimic is an All-Star, but don’t use it to exile until they tap out).

**Hexproof**

-1 Progenitor Mimic

-1 Doom Blade

-2 Putrefy	

+2 Abrupt Decay

+2 Ratchet Bomb

We have a good matchup against Hexproof pre-board with our sac effect in Far//Away and Liliana of the Veil

**Aggro**

-1 Progenitor Mimic

-2 Psychic Strike

-1 According to matchup 

+2 Ratchet Bomb

+2 Abrupt Decay


Thragtusk and Mutilate make this a pretty good matchup already. We take out Psychic Strike since it is a bit slow


**Control**

-1 Progenitor Mimic

-1 Doom Blade

-4 Mutilate

+2 Duress

+2 Appetite for Brains

+2 Pithing Needle	

We are the beatdown in this matchup, try baiting out their counters with another card before you put down a card like Garruk or Thragtusk, as these are the cards that’ll get us the game. Garruk is simply amazing post-board since a lot of esper players side out their verdicts for us. Pithing Needle is either used for Aetherling, Jace or Nephalia. Just because it costs 1 though, does not mean we need to put it down turn 1.

**W/B Humans**

-1 Progenitor Mimic

-1 Syncopate

-2 Psychic Strike

+2 Ratchet Bomb

+2 Abrupt Decay

This matchup is completely reliant on us drawing a wrath plus a removal. Our goal is to remove the Xathrid, but completely winnable.

**Mono Green Garruk/Hoof thing**


-1 Progenitor Mimic

-1 Lilianna of the Veil

-2 Putrefy

-2 Snapcaster

+2 Ratchet Bomb

+2 Abrupt Decay

+2 Pithing Needle


Matchup is fairly simple if we get a Mutilate, and Heart allows us to two for one in a few situations (doom blading or bouncing the Silverheart when they attack us).


**Wrap Up**

I think I’ve covered a basic overview of the BUG Superfriends decks. Again, and my reasoning. Thanks for reading!

EDIT: Thank you for all of the feedback! Here is the updated list with the 4th Farseek, as I realized that Aetherling was simply just a better card 99% of the time. Unfortunately could not find a way to get Lifebane Zombie in the manboard, and I still sort of do think he fits in the sideboard.

&gt;When playing aggro

&gt;I'm talking about feelings, based on the reasoning, that it should apply to a lot of people.

&gt;When playing control, but when you win, you establish control and get to keep pulling further ahead over a very long game. When you win with aggro, the game is over in a few minutes, and when you lose, you sit there feeling helpless, hoping to draw several of your few powerful spells in a row to steal a game you've fallen behind in

&gt;If you choose a deck based on the amount of time you spend winning rather than the number of wins you get

I've been playing Magic in a casual setting since 2000 and began playing competitively in early 2012. In the last year I've racked up six SCG Open series top 8s (two in standard and four in legacy). My first top 8 came during Scars block standard (at the height of UW delver) while playing a [BUG Control deck featuring Glissa the Traitor](http://sales.starcitygames.com//deckdatabase/displaydeck.php?DeckID=45346).

More recently I've top 8'd the last three SCG Opens I've played in (Legacy in Atlanta and Milwaukee and Standard in Milwaukee).

I just enjoy playing competitive Magic in general and enjoy myself even more when I can attack a format from a new/unexplored angle.

So

1366059627.0,1cexe6,[Standard] Third at SCG Milwaukee w/RUG Flash - Report,jeffhoogland,89,15,93,"I've been having a pretty crazy past month for playing magic. This weekend at Milwaukee makes for my third and fourth top 8s on the SCG Open Circuit recently. Today I would like to discuss my standard deck of choice – RUG Flash. I've been discussing and championing this deck in standard for a little over six weeks now. At the two previous opens I played the deck at I finished in the top 64 and the top 16 – so it was nice to finally break through to a top 8 with the list. You can find the 75 I played to a 3rd place finish out of 580~ people [here](http://sales.starcitygames.com//deckdatabase/displaydeck.php?DeckID=54984).

The following is a short event summary – feel free to post any questions/comments you might have below as a comment.

**Round 1 - BR Midrange**

The first round was against another brew of sorts that I can only describe as “BR Good stuff”. It had a midrangy plan that consisted of lots of removal

I dominated game one with counter magic – throughly stopping his first six or so spells before sticking a Wolfir Avenger and riding it to victory. Game two he sqeaked in with an Aristocrat+Olivia on a Cavern of Souls. In game three I was able to push through a victory even with Caverns on dragon **and** vampire.

1 - 0

**Round 2 - Junk Reanimator**

Pretty stock Junk Reanimator list

I missed up pretty badly in game one and allowed him to squeak out a turn five Angel of Serenity (AoS) to which I promptly scooped. 

We then moved into what ended up being a forty minute game two during which my full set of side board Clones were all stars. He had two AoS

Game three we presented with less than three minutes on the clock. My opponent however failed to shuffle his remove from game zone cards from our long game two back into his library. Because of this he was awarded a game loss for presenting an illegal deck.

2 - 0

**Round 3 - RG Aggro**

Lost the die roll for this matchup and my opponent had a turn one Arbor Elf into turn two Domri Rade. Domri then proceeded to do what he almost always does – absolutely nothing. Four +1's later my opponent had only drawn a single extra card from his three mana investment. RUG flash proceeded to do what it does best – chew up an aggro deck. Several removal spells and a couple of Huntmaster flips later game one closed out.

In game two I had my most glaring miss play of the day. My opponent had two Strangleroot Geists on board and as he moved to attackers I made a play on auto pilot

I won game two with one hit point – sometimes better lucky than good.

3 - 0

**Round 4 - Jund Midrange**

I really like RUG's Jund Midrange matchup. Their spell/mana base is setup in such a way that they generally can't play Cavern of Souls. This means that we have more counter magic/answers than they do relevant threats. I closed this round out in two fairly uninteresting games.

4 - 0

**Round 5 - Wolfrun Bant**

Our game one was a great game of magic. He had several Thragtusks into an Angel of Serenity

Game two was far less stimulating. He mulliganed to six keeping a hand with only GW mana and no farseeks. To compound things further he then missed his 5th land drop. The game ended soon there after.

5 - 0

**Round 6 - Esper Control**

I won the die roll here and after my opponent failed to play an Augur of Bolas on turn two I had my Snapcaster Mage do it's best Ambush Viper impersonation at the end of his second turn. That Snapcaster was able to sneak in ten points of damage before he finally spent a card to kill it – I was able to eek in the last ten points with a pair of Yeva's (one at a time) protected by some counter magic.

I am on the draw for game two and mulligan a one land seven

6 - 0

**Round 7 - Mike Nyberg with GR Brunch**

Mike is a friend of mine and he was my first loss in the swiss at this event. If you go back through the SCG coverage for the weekend this was a feature match on camera. He is playing what my group likes to call a “brunch” deck – not quite aggro

Game two he hits four land + a mana dork and powers out five drop after five drop. I on the other hand end up with nine lands on the table and four more in hand. The game ends shortly there after. Mike goes on to win his next round as well and double draws into top 8.

6 - 1

**Round 8 - GW Midrange**

In game one my opponent mulligans to five on the play and runs out of gas long before I run out of answers. In game two we play a fairly interactive game during which I have a solid answer for every play he tries to make. At one point I snuck in a Wolfir Avenger and rode it home.

7 – 1

**Round 9 – Bant Reanimator**

This deck was really interesting – it was a Bant deck splashing black for Unburial Rites and utilizing Tracker's Instincts for digging/filling up the yard. It also contained Farseek for ramp.

In game one the only real piece of action he found was a pair of Loxodon Smiters

Game two was awkward on both sides. We both stalled on three lands and then recovered at similar times. Thankfully I was able to stick a Wolfir Avenger before he played anything relevant I needed to answer. I then countered a bunch of his spells while beating down with my 3/3.

8 - 1

**Round 10 – Sam Black with Act 2**

I can ID this round and be a lock for top 8. Sam on the other hand can lose this round and still make it. He isn't familiar with the deck I am playing at all and tells me he wants to play out this last round. I have a very sub-par draw in game one and get throughly crushed. Game two I have a fairly good hand

Good guy Sam Black – even if he did make me sweat it out.

8 – 1 – 1

**Quarter Finals – Sam Black Again**

Turns out that drawing with Sam put me at the top of the 8 – 1 – 1s after swiss so I am the fifth seat – this means I am playing Sam again in the quarters.

This match was featured on camera – so check the twitch.tv archive for full footage. I was however able to turn the tables after getting crushed in round 10 – on the draw I am able to take this match down in two games.

9 – 1 – 1

**Semi Finals – Jund**

Brian ended up winning the whole event. This round was covered both on the stream and with written coverage [here](http://www.starcitygames.com/events/coverage/semifinals_jeff_hoogland_vs_br.html).   The tl/dr read version is that I took game one

9 – 2 – 1

**Wrap Up**

Over all I was fairly pleased with both my own play and the performance of the deck throughout the course of the event. Not only was it a blast to play

I would just like to comment on my use of Curse of Echoes in my sideboard before I end this post though (gotten the most questions about that one). This was a last minute change that I still do not have positive or negative feelings about after the event. In all past events these slots had been Garruk

For those who want one I've written up a sideboarding guide [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1cgkus/standard_sideboarding_with_rug_flash/).

A question for folks who read these things – is it worth while for me to do another event summary about the Loam deck I rode into a top 8 for the third time now or have you all read enough about that list?

Thanks for reading and happy flashing!

1366991357.0,1d5r81,[Standard] Is Voice of Resurgence relevant?,twotwobearz,76,9,45,"*(Disclaimer: This is a speculative article

On paper, as Craig Wescoe succinctly explained in [his recent article](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=11135), VoR does work against three of the major archetypes: aggro, midrange, and control.

Specifically: Against Blitz-style aggro, it does punishes a number of commonly-played instants (Azorius Charm, Think Twice, Sphinx's Revelation) and continues its Thragtusk impression.

How about removing it? Well

That about covers the card's strengths. How about his weaknesses?

First of all, Pillar is looking like a very reasonable card right now, as it deals well with decks from last season (particularly Naya Humans and any of the decks running mana dorks). It's also a good, proactive hedge against decks that update themselves for Dragon's Maze with Voice of Resurgence or Blood Scrivener/Zombies.

Beyond that

With that in mind

If you're using the Voice solely to trade against aggro, which is helpful.

 Against midrange, T3 Olivia/Huntmaster/Falkenrath. He also gets totally bricked by Boros Reckoner, which chumps his front half all day and probably trade up with his back half.

Versus control, a 1/1 Elemental isn't going to end games anytime soon. He also does nothing against Terminus, which is unfortunate. Finally, Sphinx's Revelation is still a very good card at sorcery-speed -- or maybe the control player just doesn't care about the token when they're wrathing the board on your next main phase anyway.

Given all this, but become less valuable later. This pretty much encapsulates the definition of an aggro card.

I think he fits best in an aggro shell that doesn't mind spending its turn 2 on a resilient and disruptive threat that has a decent percentage against the entire field. Unfortunately

How about other decks? As I alluded to earlier, and is a whole other discussion regardless.) However, his back half works extremely well with Trostani; Junk tokens or even just Junk with a small token subtheme could definitely do a lot of good work with him.

Where else might he fit? Well, he's not awful in Bant, but that deck is also very mana hungry and probably just wants to Farseek too.

All that said

He might actually be *better* in a format like Modern (or possibly even Legacy), dig, or use countermagic on their opponent's turns.

So, in some maindecks and many sideboards. But he's only a 2-drop, and the format is currently filled with decks whose game plans involve ignoring the 2-drop spot and racing to slam 3's and 4's or cheat 7's and 8's into play. That's not a good world for the Voice to really shine.

What do you think? Agree

1366897173.0,1d2y0n,[Discussion] Playing out all the rounds in Competitive Events,jeffhoogland,73,11,110,"Something that some players I travel with have often given me no end of flak for doing is playing out all the rounds in competitive REL events so long as I am still in contention for *some* prizes. I personally am of the opinion that playing in competitive events is some of the best play testing you can get. This means even when I start events 2-2 or 3-3 I keep playing until there is a zero percent chance of me winning something.

And you know what? The number of 2-2 starts I've ground out to 6-2 and 7-2 finishes are many. I also believe my better performance in other events can easily be tied to this extra playing.

What is spike's opinion on dropping from events once you are ""out of top 8 contention""? As I indicated above - I think this is foolish. Am I alone in this line of thought?

1369753373.0,1f7a1q,[Standard] RUG Flash Update in DGM Standard,jeffhoogland,77,9,74,"Okie dokie folks - I've had a number of people asking for some updated content with regards to the standard deck I've been playing for the last couple months now - RUG Flash. This post is intended for folks who want to think about their selections. For those who just want to copy a 75 and start playing you can always find my latest deck [here](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/magic-carpet/).

I've waited until now to post something because I wanted to prove to myself this arch type was still worth playing with the release of DGM - and I believe it is. I've played the in three large events since rotation with the following results:

* 200~ man PTQ
* 450~ man SCG Open
* 150~ man PTQ - 7-2 for 5th place

As I believe my results show - this arch type is competitive in addition to the crazy amounts of fun it is to play.

Instead of posting a specific deck list

**Threats:**

These are what we close the game out with. I've been playing with the following threat base I believe it is what you want to be playing:

* 4 [Huntmaster of the Fells](http://tappedout.net/mtg-card/huntmaster-of-the-fells/)
* 3 [Snapcaster Mage](http://tappedout.net/mtg-card/snapcaster-mage/)
* 4 [Wolfir Avenger](http://tappedout.net/mtg-card/wolfir-avenger/)
* 4 [Yeva

People always ask about Thragtusk (and now Atherling). I've played with both these cards and they feel out of place in this shell. I wouldn't play them main deck.

**Counter Magic:**

The reason this deck is so powerful is because we can play counter magic without being punished. I recommend the following counter suite:

* 3 [Dissipate](http://tappedout.net/mtg-card/dissipate/)
* 3 [Syncopate](http://tappedout.net/mtg-card/syncopate/)
* 1 [Izzet Charm](http://tappedout.net/mtg-card/izzet-charm/)

If you feel your metagame calls for more counter magic than what is listed above I've played up to three Izzet Charm main at certain points and this is a fine choice. It is a very flexible card that is rarely a dead draw.

Other cards that get mentioned a lot are Rewind and now Plasm Capture. While Rewind is a fine spell for heavy Midrange/Control meta games

Plasm Capture just isn't want this deck wants to be doing at all. The point of that card is to slam bombs - something we do not do.

**Removal:**

You should be playing a minimum of 10 pieces of spot removal. Which pieces you play should depend on what decks you are expecting to play against. You should have some combination of the following:

* [Izzet Charm](http://tappedout.net/mtg-card/izzet-charm/)
* [Searing Spear](http://tappedout.net/mtg-card/Searing-Spear/)
* [Turn / Burn](http://tappedout.net/mtg-card/turn-burn/)
* [Mizzium Mortars](http://tappedout.net/mtg-card/Mizzium-Mortars/)
* [Pillar of Flame](http://tappedout.net/mtg-card/pillar-of-flame/)

**Utility Cards/Lands:**

I feel the following are must includes:

* [Think Twice](http://tappedout.net/mtg-card/think-twice/)
* [Desolate Lighthouse](http://tappedout.net/mtg-card/desolate-lighthouse/)

Think Twice is both a straight forward source of card advantage

I firmly believe at this point that Desolate Lighthouse is the correct utility land for RUG Flash to be playing. Essentially it allows you to turn every land you draw after your 7th or 8th into a spell - which is a powerful ability to have. I've taken to playing 23 duals and 2 loothouse in my main deck.

**Sideboard Selection:**

Again

*Clones:*

* [Clone](http://tappedout.net/mtg-card/clone/)
* [Progenitor Mimic](http://tappedout.net/mtg-card/progenitor-mimic/)

Pretty sure you want a mix of Clone effects. I've been playing 4-5 clones in my board since Dragon's Maze released and they make reanimator a pretty easy match up. 4 mana VS 6 is a big difference though - so I think you want a split on these guys.

*Supplemental Removal:*

* [Mizzium Mortars](http://tappedout.net/mtg-card/Mizzium-Mortars/)
* [Pillar of Flame](http://tappedout.net/mtg-card/pillar-of-flame/)
* [Turn / Burn](http://tappedout.net/mtg-card/turn-burn/)

Just like the main deck

*Unsummon Effects:*

* [Cyclonic Rift](http://tappedout.net/mtg-card/cyclonic-rift/)
* [Unsummon](http://tappedout.net/mtg-card/unsummon/)

The main reason to play Rift over just Unsummon is that Rift can bounce enchantments. This is a really nice ""getcha"" when they attack in with their suited up Giest of St. Truck.

*Sweepers:*

* [Electrickery](http://tappedout.net/mtg-card/electrickery/)
* [Rolling Temblor](http://tappedout.net/mtg-card/rolling-temblor/)
* [Magmaquake](http://tappedout.net/mtg-card/Magmaquake/)

Electrickery is nice for killing Invisible Stalkers before the suit up and has the nice ability of killing most turn 1 plays out of aggro decks.

The discussion here is really Magmaquake VS Rolling Temblor. I'm currently thinking Rolling Temblor is the card you want - for two reasons.

1.) It flashes back. This makes 2 for 1s or better a lot more common with this card when you get the game to go long.

2.) It allows you to kill a turn 2 Giest on the play or a turn 3 Giest on the draw.

I really hate losing to Giest.

*Control Hate:*

UWx decks have been less popular of the late and I personally do not think they are a super good metagame choice (obviously this varies from week to week). Thankfully

* [Counterflux](http://tappedout.net/mtg-card/counterflux/)
* [Curse of Echoes](http://tappedout.net/mtg-card/curse-of-echoes/)

Both these cards allow you combat Revelations in nice ways. 

* [Garruk
* [AEtherling](http://tappedout.net/mtg-card/aetherling/)

These are hard to deal with threats that can close a game out on their own.

*Misc:*

* [Dissipate](http://tappedout.net/mtg-card/dissipate/)
* [Ground Seal](http://tappedout.net/mtg-card/ground-seal/)

Ground Seal is primarily extra reanimator hate and Dissipate does double duty of being good VS reanimator and being extra counter magic for the control/midrange match ups.

**Wrap Up:**

Hopefully you all learned something about my favorite standard deck. Have any questions/comments feel free to drop them below.

See yall in Chicago for the WMCQ this weekend.

Each Player can control the same Legendary Permanent. Legendary Rule only applies to a player controlling two of that permanent. For example

This also applies to Planeswalkers as well. Both players can now control a JTMS at the same time. 

Also there have been revisions made to sideboarding:
""We're also making an adjustment to sideboard composition in Constructed tournaments. Previously, your main deck is still sixty or more cards but your sideboard is now up to fifteen cards. Additionally, you are not required to swap cards between your main deck and sideboard on a one-for-one basis. For Games 2 and 3 (and so on), as long as your main deck is sixty or more cards and your sideboard is no more than fifteen cards, you're good. This change makes sideboarding in Constructed and in Limited closer.

1363015614.0,1a33db,[Legacy] Third at SCG Indy - Report,jeffhoogland,70,10,54,"Howdy All

This is a report from the SCG Legacy open in Indy this past weekend that had over 300 people – I finished third. You can find my deck list with a deck tech [here](http://www.starcitygames.com/events/coverage/deck_tech_4_color_loam_with_je.html). This list is what my friends and I refer to as the ""Norton Special"" - he is the man that designed the core of the list. I've changed maybe 5~ cards from the 75 he gave me.

I’ve posted a few things around here before. I’m what you could call a Midwest grinder

**Round 1 – No Side Board Burn**

Sometimes rounds 1-2 can be a bye at these things. My round one opponent sat down across from me and set his deck face up on the table for all to see – Chain Lightning. We shuffle and cut, chalice of the void and three cards that aren’t terribly relevant. He wins the die roll and bolts me to 17, I untap and slam a chalice on one. The game ends a few turns later after I stick a Knight.

Game 2

1 – 0

**Round 2 – Adam Prosak with ANT**

This is one of those times where keeping up with the SCG circuit paid off. Prosak sits down across from me and I put him on ANT even though I haven’t seen him play yet today. I win the die roll and mulligan aggressively on the play

Game 2. I probably should have mulliganed some more. I also miss-sideboarded and brought in both my thoughtseize by mistake. I might have been able to pull this game out if I had left a thoughtseize in my SB to burning wish for on turn 3.

Game 3. I act like a good magic player and mulligan aggressively again – I am rewarded for my troubles. I go to 5 on the play again, my next two draws are Knight, followed by a second chalice which I promptly place on zero. He dies 4 turns later to a 5/5 Knight.

2 – 0

**Round 3 – RUG Delver**

I don’t recall the exact specifics of our game 1 – I just remember he didn’t have a threat in his opening hand

3 – 0

**Round 4 – Camera Match with Goblins**

Variance caught up with me in game one of this match. I have one land in my 7 and then no lands in my 6

Games two and three I Devastate his Dreams – in the most literal sense. I’ve yet to lose a match to goblins with this list – and this round was no exception. I stick a knight and cast DD for 3+ cards at least once in both of the last games. In game two I killed him in one shot with a 19/19 Knight.

4 – 0

**Round 5 – Maverick**

He wins the die roll and I mulligan to 6. He leads out with cavern of souls on humans into Nobel Hiarch. I draw my card for the turn and decide to be aggressive. I play a land

Game 2. We have this really awkward board stall that I can’t find a DD to break. I did however draw all four Knights – they ran him over.

5 - 0

**Round 6 – Alex Binek with UWr Control**

Binek is a good friend of mine and we are one of the only top tables not called over to the feature match area. I can only describe our match as a grindy 50 minute troll fest. I had some very timely abrupt decays to kill his counter balances and a RIP in game one. In the second game I was able to bait a FoW with a dark confidant and then stick a game winning devastating dreams. I always hate beating a friend so late in an event

6 - 0

**Round 7 – Eric Riley with NO Elf Ball**

Eric is a very good player – he has top 8s under his belt wielding his legacy weapon of choice (Elves). Thankfully creature decks without counter magic have a VERY poor DD match up. Not going to lie, but my punishing fires are able to get me there. 

Game 2. I messed up again – I forget that elf ball now plays NO as a finisher. I boarded out my Gaddock Teeg. Whoops. He kills me very dead with a Progenitus while I fail to find white mana for the Retribution of the Meek I found with my burning wish. 

Game 3. I fix my side boarding mistake and bring back in my main deck Sir Teeglesworth along with my sideboard copy. On the play I put him into a “soft lock” with double chalice on 1 into Teeg. I eventually beat him down with my bear.

7 – 0

**Rounds 8/9**

The next two rounds I ID with RUG delver and twelve post. These are both fairly good matchups and I want them in the top 8 with me. Swiss record 7 – 0 – 2. I’ve only dropped three games all day – one of which I mulliganed out of. I’m feeling good. Entering top 8 as the third seat

**Quarter Finals – Twelve Post**

This matchup isn’t close – watch the camera coverage if you don’t believe me. Game one I have turn 1 dark confidant off of a wasteland and a mox diamond. Game two I’m not nearly as explosive

**Semi Finals – Binek Again**

We prize split the top 4. I was fairly giddy with excitement, I punted game two to him and game three he helm combo’d me out of the game. The entirety of the match myself, Binek and the handful of judges remaining were laughing pretty hard while Alex and I trolled each other in both subtle and obvious ways. Easily the most fun I’ve had playing magic ever.

**Wrap Up**

So over all I went 8 – 1 – 2 in matches for the day. I was pleased with my play for most of the day and I have a nice check coming in the mail to pay for future magical trips.

Thanks for reading this wall of text – feel free to drop any questions below as comments.

I was really happy with my 75 all day. Going into a diverse field of match ups I believe I would play the same list again in a heart beat. That being said - I do tweak based on the meta game I expect. For instance if I am expecting more grindy/fair decks I generally cut the second GSZ for a Volrath's Stronghold for more late game creatures. A Scavaging Ooze also bounces in and out of the 75 based on how many graveyard decks are running around and the number of creatures seeing play.

I'll talk about specific card selection and things I'd change after I talk a bit about the rounds I played.

**Round 1 - Evan with Jund**

So one of the things I've discovered is that the more people who know my name

Jund is something I consider to be a fairly good match up for RUG. We have more counter magic and removal than they do threats. Our added access to Turn / Burn allows us to care very little about the Cavern of Souls Jund is now playing. 

The one of Cyclonic Rift I added to my board the day before the event really did work in this match up. It works well for resetting an Olivia that has grown too large and at one point I was able to bounce a resolved Sire in response to its trigger.

I won this round in three fairly tight games.

1 - 0

**Round 2 - RG Aggro**

Not much to say about this round. He possibly should have mulliganed his hand in the first game. I won this round 2-0

2 - 0

**Round 3 - Junk Reanimator**

In game one this round my opponent kept what I like to refer to as a ""guild gate"" hand - meaning his first two lands entered the battlefield tapped. On his turn three a well placed Izzet Charm countered a Mulch. He didn't make a third land drop that turn. By the time he finally hit his third and fourth lands I was far enough ahead that it didn't matter.

In our second game I mulliganed to six, but I lacked a second green mana still and was unable to catch back up.

In the third game he mulliganed to five on the draw

3 - 0

**Round 4 - Big Naya**

I'm still torn on if big Naya is a good or bad match up for RUG (need to play test it some more that is for sure). I was able to handle his larger threats with counter magic and then mopped up the Loxodon Smiters that slipped through the cracks with Mizzium Mortars and Yevas. I won this match up 2-0

4 - 0

**Round 5 - Bant Hexproof**

This was a camera match you can find in the SCG Archives. I'd just like to talk about one play I had in our second game that was... Greedy to say the least. 

My opponent had spent his second and third turns playing Invisible Stalkers. I was feeling good with the Electrickery in my hand - but a two for one wasn't good enough for me. I wanted to three for one this card. I let my opponent untap and start his fourth turn. When he cast a Spectral Flight targeting one of his stalkers I responded with an overloaded Electrickery.

I got blown out by a negate. Thankfully I was able to race the pair of Invisible Stalkers and take this match up 2-0

5 - 0

**Round 6 - Ben Weinberg with Naya Blitz**

Generally, I failed to play around a Giant Growth and ended up taking ten extra points of damage on an attack because of it. That game didn't last much longer.

On the play for game two

I've been thinking a lot about the seven cards I kept in this game. On the draw I kept:

* Cyclonic Rift
* Searing Spear
* 2 Huntmaster of the Fells
* 3 lands that provide all my colors

This hand seems sweet

After Thalia put me very far off tempo I died very quickly.

5 - 1

**Round 7 - Dickie playing RUG Peddler**

Flash is really good against clunky midrange decks with a limited number of threats like this one. This match up played out very similar to Naya in round four. I countered his large threats

Even though it has a poor RUG Flash match up

6 - 1

**Round 8 - Bant Hexproof**

This match up can be a tough one for RUG due to how many different angles Bant Hexproof attacks from. Sometimes they come at you with Invisible Stalkers

I kept a hand in game one that was a poor one to keep against Bant Hexproof and quickly died.

In game two I was able to deal with the first few threats he deployed

In game three I had all the right answers at all the right times. I killed a turn 2 Invisible Stalker with an Eletricky (on my turn this time!) and then was able to answer a turn three Giest of St Traft with a Clone after only taking a single hit from it.

7 - 1

**Round 9 - Jund Aggro**

This is a ""win and in round"". Meaning if I win this round

This is one of the many times during the event where I sorely missed having a full set of Searing Spears. I kept a hand in game one that wasn't terribly good against aggro and quickly died to a pair of Boars backed up by three bloodrush creatures.

In game two I once more died to an aggressive start with three toughness creatures backed up by bloodrush. Sadly

**Round 10 - Intentional Draw**

At SCG opens 9th-32nd place receive the exact same prize. Knowing top 8 was out of reach even with a win in this last round my opponent and I drew so we could both be in the top 32.

**Wrap Up**

I am still exploring the exact card selection I want in both the main and the side board for this list. I know for certain at any future event I want to be playing 3-4 Searing Spear again. Cutting down to only two of that spell was a mistake. Not sure on what my cuts will be for it yet – but they will be getting added back in.

In terms of side board – Izzet Staticaster was a turd all day. Cyclonic Rift on the other hand seemed to over perform every time I drew it. You will also note I've dropped the Curse of Echoes from the board. This is because UWx decks are **not** good in the metagame we are currently seeing right now. Because of this I did not want to devote board slots to this archetype – this could very well change for future events.

Have any questions/comments feel free to drop them below and I'll answer when I can. To all the other grinders out there I'm taking next weekend off

1366708592.0,1cxcfz,[modern] Designing Combo Elves,aboshan,67,14,80,"How do we build combo elves in modern? I've got an initial list that I like

Here's my initial take: 

* 4 Arbor Elf
* 4 Llanowar Elves
* 4 Nettle Sentinel
* 4 Heritage Druid
* 2 Deathrite Shaman
* 4 Elvish Visionary
* 4 Elvish Archdruid
* 4 Summoner's Pact Targets (see below) 
* 4 Summoner's Pact
* 4 Beck // Call 
* 4 Intruder Alarm
* 4 Misty Rainforest 
* 4 Verdant Catacombs
* 4 Forbidden Orchard
* 2 Dryad Arbor
* 2 Breeding Pool
* 1 Overgrown Tomb
* 1 Forest

There are two different versions you can run: Intruder Alarm based combo and Cloudstone Curio based combo. Both make your deck subtly different. I've been impressed with the power of Intruder Alarm and unimpressed with how difficult it is to go off with Curio, though they're still good with Beck. 

I like Coiling Oracle

**My configuration for the Pact slots currently is:**

* 1 Craterhoof Behemoth
* 1 Regal Force
* 1 Wren's Run Packmaster
* 1 Ezuri

**Comments on Pact choices:** 

* I think Craterhoof is a requirement. Emrakul would be okay if you could find it via Summoner's Pact. 
* Wren's Run Packmaster can be one of ten different cards- Imperious Perfect, so Sprout Swarm isn't an option, but I'd run it otherwise. Imperious Perfect is also an elf lord and would be my choice if I didn't have to wait a turn to go off with it. 
* Ezuri is wrath protection
* I haven't been tutoring for Regal Force much
* Other options for pact choices include Yeva to try to go off on their end step, and Eternal Witness to recur things. 

**Other comments** 

* Consider Vengevine as either a sideboard or maindeck option. 
* I'd like a good way to give things haste
* Weird Harvest and Chord of Calling are both reasonable tutors,,False,,t5_2utkz,False,,True

2 Rewind  
1 Syncopate  

The main benefits of Dragon's Maze are AEtherling and Turn//Burn. Aetherling gives the deck a damage-based closer that is much more powerful and resilient than Aurelia, it dodges as much removal as you have mana open, and it can close out a game in a couple of turns. If ever there was a deck for this card, this is it. It gives you a strong game against Esper control, which was severely lacking, as often Aurelia could be dealt with before she is able to close the game, and there's always inherent risk with Reckoners and a single instant-speed removal spell from your opponent. Obviously

I had high expectations for Turn//Burn at the prerelease, and Burn the one that dies to a Shock. If needed, it can 1-for-1 an Angel of Serenity (and they don't get their guys back) or a Thragtusk. It's also an instant-speed answer to Sire of Insanity, which I predict will be a real issue for the deck. A cool added utility of the card is that you can flashback Turn with Snapcaster and then just eat the attacker with your 2/1. Due to its versatility, I can't imagine running less than 3 in any list, but for now, I'm suggesting 4. Given AEtherling's ability to close a game (and that I'm pretty sure that 25 lands with 4 TT and 4 Sphinxes is enough), I'm trying -2 Rewind and -1 Searing Spear because I think that these overlap most in intended role

These considerations put me at this list:

I haven't included a sideboard yet because I'm not sure how the metagame is going to develop, I would anticipate some amount of sideboarded countermagic for the control matchup. Due to RIP's strength against both Aristocrats Act 2 and Reanimator, I would probably put a couple of those in as well.

1365540418.0,1c0j8e,[Legacy] Third at SCG Atlanta - Report,jeffhoogland,54,12,13,"Howdy All

I’m back with another legacy event report – this time from the SCG Open in Atlanta. After having a stellar 7-1 day one at the invitational

The [write up](http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1a33db/legacy_third_at_scg_indy_report/) from my third place finish at SCG Indy was well received here and I’ve had a few requests from folks to do another write up – so here one is. 

**Round 1 – Chris VanMeter with UWBg Blade**

Sometimes round one at these things can be a bye – this was not one of those times. Chris is an established player

Sylvan Library was a last minute addition to my list before the legacy open (I hadn’t ever played it in loam previously). Library was worth its weight in gold this matchup. Over the course of the two games we played I easily drew at least six extra cards off of it (at one point I had a giant Knight get plowed giving me a ton of room to draw cards that game). 

In both games one and two I resolved very timely devastating dreams to lock him out of the game by wrathing his board and destroying all of his lands.

1 – 0

**Round 2 – Lands**

This is honestly a matchup I’d never played before – I’m still not sure if it is favorable or not. I was honestly just pleased we finished three games without going to time. In game one I resolved a Knight which quickly got stalemated by a few Maze of Ith on the other side of the table. Using the Knight to thin as many cards as possible out of my deck I was eventually able to draw a Devastating Dreams and cast it for seven – killing every land on his side of the table – a turn later he died to my massive Knight.

In game two I got locked out of the game fairly hard by his Wastelands (powered out by Exploration) and Engineered Explosives killing my Mox Diamonds. I know when I’m beat and scooped up my cards even though he wasn’t going to actually kill me for another 20~ minutes. Know when you need to beat the clock people!

Game three he died to a very large Knight yet again. The series of plays that got me there was the following though:
“Float green from my forest and float black from my Bojuka Bog. Knight my Forst into a Wasteland. Wasteland my Bojuka Bog. Loam back my Forst

Bogging the graveyard engine deck every other turn is a heck of a plan.

2 – 0

**Round 3 – UWBg Blade with Lingering Souls/Sorin**

Another take on Esper Blade this round – this time with a token based back up plan. In game one he leads by fetching up some non-basic lands (mistake!). I punish him by wastelanding him a bunch – but not before he floods a bunch of Lingering Souls tokens onto the table. A few turns later a Devastating Dreams and Knight a mop up his tokens and close out the game.

In game two I can tell he is fairly pleased with the seven cards he gets to keep. That is fine

Chalice of the Void is a heck of a magic card.

3 – 0

**Round 4 – Jund**

Jund can be a rough matchup for this Loam list. If a Deathrite sits on the table your engine is basically turned off. Thankfully Punishing Fire

Game three literally came down to a single top deck. He has bolted me down to two life with a Deathrite on the table

As an aside I was his only loss in the swiss – he made top 8 with me (Zach Tyree).

4 – 0

**Round 5 – Josh Glantzman with RUG Delver**

Josh is a friend of mine and I know this is his first weekend playing RUG Delver. I also know he made top 16 at the invitational missing his *win and in* round 16 VS Gerry T. His record with RUG delver for the weekend thus far you ask? A casual 12-0 of course. He also knows I really like Loam’s RUG Delver match up though.

This was the first dice roll I lost today

Game two Josh has what I can only describe as the “nut” hand out of RUG delver. Turn one delver

In game three I finally get to be on the play. I don’t remember all the details from this one aside from the fact that he countered the first five times I cast loam leaving me stuck on just a Tiaga and a Mox Diamond for a very long time. Thankfully his turn two delver didn’t flip right away and eventually he ran out of counter magic. Once my first loam resolved the game ran away from him very quickly.

5 – 0

**Round 6 – Bant Maverick**

Piece of advice folks – pile shuffle your deck and pack it away from both you *and* your opponent. This person was nice enough to show me a Mother of Runes and Tropical Island before the match even started. As far as I could tell his blue splash was purely for Giest.

In game one I was looking very

In game two the board came to a stale mate for a few turns until I could draw into a Devastating Dreams to mop things up. Thankfully he didn’t have a Knight of his own this time – so I was able to wrath his entire board while leaving behind a 17/17 Knight for myself.

6 – 0

**Round 7 – Max Tietze with Goblins**

There are only four undefeated players remaining – but it is still too early to ID. Max is the opponent I was hoping for this round – even though he is crazy good at playing Goblins I still have yet to lose to Goblins in a sanctioned event while playing Loam. He wins the die roll and has a hyper aggressive start that leaves me at one life on turn three. I have a Tiaga and a Devestating Dreams in my hand

I haven’t mentioned it yet in this write up, Mox Diamond, Dark Confidant, Knight. Max’s eyes get wide as I play a turn one Dark Confidant and pass. My read on him keeping a sketchy hand is dead on. His turn one is a port into a relic and he then has to cycle the relic on turn two in order to make his second land drop. A Knight and a Devastating Dreams later I close out game two.

Game three is really close and there is no doubt in my mind that I would not have won it if I hadn’t had a Sylvan Library active (if you aren’t familiar with how Sylvan Library and dredge interact together you should find a smart judge and ask them). Three Abrupt Decays to kill a Relic and two Vials later I stick a Knight and close things out once again with a Devastating Dreams.

7 – 0

**Rounds 8/9**

I am able to ID these last two rounds to make it into top 8. Sadly

**Quarter Finals – TES (The Perfect Storm)** 

TES hasn’t been getting nearly as much attention as ANT lately

**Semi Finals – Jund**

I could just be your typical magic player about this round and claim that my opponent drew “the nuts” while I failed to draw anything relevant. While I feel like his draws might have been above average

*Wrong*. 

I did end up bricking on my Library draws for far longer than I should have

But hey – this was my 25th round of magic in 48 hours. To say I was getting a bit burned out at that point was an understatement. 

**Wrap Up**

Once more I finished the event 8 – 1 – 2 in matches (not bad). I still love playing this arch type and there is a very high chance I will be playing it at SCG Milwaukee this coming weekend. Sylvan Library was a flipping all star in my deck for most of the day and I am still not sure why I hadn’t tried it sooner.

Thanks for reading this wall of text and as always if you have any questions/comments feel free to drop them below.

My inner Timmy roared when Kalonian Hydra was spoiled. I'm on my phone and can't link

3GG, trample, etb w/ 4 +1/+1 counters, when ~ attacks, double the num of +1/+1 counters on each creature you control.

Since I mostly play limited, and I realized this by playing limited. The RTR block oozes mechanics that beg to be abused by Kalonian Hydra. Unleash, evolve and scavenge each add +1/+1 counters to creatures. Additionally, for 3 months, we have access to cards with Undying, such as Strangleroot Geist and Young Wolf.

The biggest concern everyone has with Hydra is that it has no board impact when you cast it. You need to untap with it in order for it to be relevant. With the return of doom blade to standard, and Ogre Battledriver makes your topdecks much more powerful.

Dreadbore is for esper control decks/Reckoner

Doom Blade is for reckoner

Devour Flesh is for hexproof

Ooze is for graveyard hate and comes in fully to replace Gyre Sage

Acidic Slime is a cool cat

**Other considerations and notes:**

* Card advantage is limited
* ~~Not great vs Aristocrats~~ Post-changes
* ~~Boros Reckoner stonewalls the deck
* Gyre sage underperformed the first time around
* Best curve: t1 dork, t4 hydra
* Rakdos's return shreds control decks
* New garruk is awesome for the same reasons domri is - hard to kill
* No answer to Predator Ooze aside from Slaughter Games - considering Tragic Slip as sideboard removal
* Deck lacks a way to gain life aside from Scavenging Ooze
* Okay

**Playtesting records:**

(These are matches

* OVERALL RECORD: 10-5
* 1-0 vs Esper Control
* 2-0 vs Bant Pants
* 2-1 vs Aristocrats

1369100975.0,1eqipx,[Legacy] 19th at SCG Nashville - Report,jeffhoogland,50,8,24,"Because of the character limit on self posts I had to split this report into two of them. You can read about my SCG Nashville standard finish [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1eqinj/standard_21st_at_scg_nashville_report/).

**Legacy -**

In legacy I'm still rocking the four color Loam list that has been serving me well for the last few months. You can find a full primer on the deck [here](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/26118_Loam-Is-Where-The-Heart-Is.html).

**Round 1 - Goblins**

I won the die roll in game one and kept a bit of a risky hand:

* 2 Mox Diamond
* Knight of the Reliquary
* 3 Land
* Wasteland

This is a fairly all-in hand that odds are would either win or lose almost on the spot. Against Goblins this hand was pretty amazing though. Turn one Knight

Game two ended when I cast the first Devastating Dreams.

1 - 0

**Round 2 - Alex with Esper Stoneblade**

Alex had finished second in the standard open that morning (congrats!). I won the die roll and then we both mulliganed to six before starting our game. My six was stellar. Turn one Chalice of the Void followed up by a turn two Dark Confidant prompted a scooped from my opponent on the third turn once he saw Knight get flipped to my Bob.

This was one of those games where knowing the legacy format inside and out has its advantages. After seeing only an Island and an Academy Ruins from my opponent I was able to correctly assume he was playing Esper-blade. Our second game was fairly unexciting.

2 - 0

**Round 3 - Elves**

Another person who sat down across from me knowing what deck I was playing. Thankfully he was playing Elves - a fairly good match up for Loam.

I won the die roll and kept a hand that had a curve of cycle land

On the draw in game two he led with a Deathrite Shaman on one

3 - 0

**Round 4 - UR Delver**

As always Chalice of the Void was punching the clock and going to work today. I won the die roll and had a turn one Chalice on the play. The only spells he played this game were a Snapcaster Mage and a Force of Will. 

Game two I had another turn one Chalice (lot of those today). Nothing else very interesting in this game.

4 - 0

**Round 5 - Lands**

This was a camera match you can find in the SCG Archives.

My opponent in this round was flustered during our third game as the clock was running short and dredged his Loam

5 - 0

**Round 6 - Adam Prosak with ANT**

Prosak and I both knew what the other was playing. We've played this match up before and both know what to expect going in. He won the die roll and we then proceeded to have a fairly awkward game one. Because he was on the play

The game progressed and Adam cast an Ad Nausem which took him all the way down to three life while I had a Dark Confidant on the table. I untapped, a Wasteland, a Burning Wish or a Punishing Fire to close the game out.

Moving on to game two I had a double Chalice hand with two lands to start. I lead with a land and a Chalice on zero and passed the turn. Unfortunately for me

5 - 1

**Round 7 - Joe with Natural Order Bant**

After losing my first win and in last round to Prosak I am pumped to have a second chance at top 8. I know what Joe is playing as I have been watching the other players at the top tables for the last few rounds. I'm pretty excited to have this as my match up - four main deck Perish are pretty good against the Natural Order deck.

Sadly, my 26 land deck doesn't mind this line of play - but as I started my third turn I still had not drawn another land. No worries - I played my Savannah and cast Green Sun's Zenith to find my Dryad Arbor. On his turn he plowed my Dryad Arbor and I then failed to make a second land drop for the remainder of the game. 

Trying my best not to tilt I shuffle up for game two and draw my starting hand:

* 3 Land
* Mox Diamond
* Sylvan Library
* 2 Other Cards

Sweet! Turn one Library - I can't possibly stumble on lands this game

I signed the match slip and wished Joe good luck in the top 8.

**Round 8 - Intentional Draw/UW Rest in Peace**

Once again I offered the draw to my opponent so we could both make top 32. He accepted

Game one I had a strong start with a Chalice of the Void on turn one into a Knight of the Reliquary on two. An Abrupt Decay on a Rest in Peace and a few turns later I beat down my opponent with my Knight.

Game two I assembled my favorite ""soft lock"" of Chalice on one + Gaddock Teeg. Ten turns later my bear had beaten him into submission. 

**Wrap Up**

I don't really have much to say about my legacy list that wasn't already said in the [primer](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/26118_Loam-Is-Where-The-Heart-Is.html). If you want to hear about some legacy from a slightly different perspective [u/DarkM27](http://www.reddit.com/user/Darkm27) should be posting an event report from his top 16 finish from Nashville this weekend ~~in the next few days~~ [his report](http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1eqr81/legacy_15th_at_scg_nashville_with_bug_stuff_report/).

First, last Wednesday broke our record for unique visitors and pageviews (3,500 uniques and 11,500 pageviews), and also managed to bring 50 new subscribers to the subreddit.

Given this influx of new members

* **Don't be a jerk.** Personal attacks or disparaging comments will not be tolerated. This includes anything along the lines of ""you clearly don't understand how to play Magic."" That said

* **Keep downvotes to a minimum.** Don't downvote someone because you think their opinion is ""wrong"" (about a deck, reply and explain why you disagree.

* **Please report problematic threads or posts** using the button on every thread/post. This is the easiest way of bringing issues to the mods' attention.

* **We're only interested in discussing competitive Magic.** In general

* **Don't just post a decklist and expect us to critique it.** If you want to talk about an unproven deck
Posts that don't meet are subject to being removed.

* **Please remember to tag your posts.** For instance

Finally, including another installment of Winning Wednesday and [the upcoming AMA with Jeff Hoogland](http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1cgk7u/jeff_hoogland_coming_off_of_double_top_4/)!

The full set of dual lands opens up new color combinations. Do you think we might see a viable grixis control now that they can reliably use mutilate as a sweeper? Does the one-drop token make a token aggro strategy more viable?

So 6 days ago, and have messaged each person with a constructive way to increase the actual content in their posts. Many of the same points have been repeated, so I wanted to share a few of them with you.

- Be as informative as possible

This point is the biggest. The more you can tell us about your topic

- Don't speculate without testing

If you have an idea for a deck, then it wasn't worth asking and you've gained experience. If it is good or if you've had mixed results, that's a great time to make a topic.

- Nobody wants to talk about YOUR deck

If I asked anybody here if they cared about what deck I was playing, what you should include in your deck, if your deck is any good, nobody wants to see it because they are busy with their own decks.

Instead, and other more broadly interesting topics. If the post is about Magic and not about you, people are far more willing to listen.

Those are some preliminary ways to improve this sub's quality overall.

We have also decided that the Critique Your Deck thread is more often a place where we put things we don't want to see on the front page. Since we're moving toward discussions on archetypes and less about specific lists

1366746144.0,1cyg2a,[WMCQ DC] 12th Place with Naya Midrange,jellomoose,48,8,17,"A few friends and I were planning to make the trip down to DC from NYC for the WMCQ



Deck List found here: 

[http://sales.starcitygames.com//deckdatabase/displaydeck.php?DeckID=55189](http://sales.starcitygames.com//deckdatabase/displaydeck.php?DeckID=55189)



During the player meeting we were told that we had 372 players and would be slogging it out for 9 rounds.  At this point I was quite happy to have had a decent nights sleep and a good breakfast from a local cafe.



**Round 1: UWR Midrange**


Game 1: My opponent stumbled on mana


Sideboard:  I took out the Bonfires and the Selesnya Charms in favor of Garruk, Sigarda and a single Rest in Peace for the mise (I saw multiple Think Twices as well as Harvest Pyre).


Game 2: My opponent again has some mana and land drop issues.  I had a Boros Reckoner and Loxodon Smiter that kept attacking into Azorious Charm (I believe they used all 4 over the course of the game).  At some point I got down Assemble the Legion and the clock quickly became overwhelming.


**2-1 (1-0)**



**Round 2: Junk Rites**


Game 1: I Bonfired away multiple mana dorks and spirit tokens early and got to work with Thundermaw.  They were able to cast one Angel of Serenity


Sideboard:  I sideboarded out some number of Smiters (they seem to be lower impact when the opponent has Slimes)


Game 2:  I believe in this game he got a very quick Angel of Serenity and there was no Miracle Bonfire


Game 3:  In similar fashion to Game 1


**2-1 (2-0)**



**Round 3: Junk Rites**


Game 1 and 2:  This was a very quick match where I was able to cast and/or miracle multiple Bonfires per game and had a Selesnya Charm for any Thragtusk blinking shenanigans he tried to use to stabilize.  I felt my opponent had some bad luck and never really was in the match.  He got his vengeance on Sunday when he beat me in a close 3 game match in the PTQ.  I sideboarded the same way as the previous round.


**2-0 (3-0)**



**Round 4: Bant Control (w/ Drownyard)**


Game 1:  My opponent’s deck looked like it was a bit behind the current trends in a number of ways:  he was using Drownyard instead of Wolf Run and had multiple main deck Terminii.  The first game involved me playing my Thundermaws and pseudo-haste EOT Restoration Angels very carefully.  He miracled quite a few Terminii but I was able to grind out the win.


Sideboard: I took out my Avacyn’s Pilgrims and shaved a few other cards here and there in favor of Assemble


Game 2:  This was a very back and forth game where he was trying to keep a Jace, but luckily I was able to recoup card advantage by drawing 5 cards with each of my Garruks to make the fight a bit closer.


Game 3:  In this game I was able to ramp out a very early Assemble the Legion and he never really found an answer.  Eventually I stopped deploying creature based threats from my hand and just slammed the soldiers into his side of the board turn after turn until victory.


**2-1 (4-0)**



**Round 5: Wolf Run Bant**


My opponent this round was very nice and very excited to be undefeated.  It seemed like he was the only one out of his friends that was able to slip in at the end of registration while they were finding parking.  Unfortunately


Game 1: I was applying quite a bit of pressure and he had the option to use an Azorious Charm on a Thundermaw but we were playing the standard game of “Wolf Run Chicken”:


Me: “Attack with Smiter
Him: “No blocks”
Me: “Pass priority
Him: &lt;long pause&gt; “Ok.”
Me: “Take 12
Him: “Oh wow... that was pretty bad.”


Basically I had enough mana to Wolf Run for 3 or 4


Sideboard: Same as the prior Bant opponent.


Game 2:  In this game my deck stumbled a bit and he was able to resolve multiple large Sphinx’s Revelations.  I don’t think I drew any of my haymakers and it was over fairly quick.


Game 3:  This game went similar to the first one.  I had lots of early pressure and was able to follow up his Supreme Verdict with a string of deadly Thundermaws.  When it looked like he might stabilize on the back of a few Azorious Charms


**2-1 (5-0)**



**Round 6: Naya Blitz**


Game 1:  This game my opponent did the classic Naya Blitz curve of Champion into BTE + Mauler into Frontline Medic.  I ended up not being able to deal with the Medic and could not mount an offense while still keeping up enough defense.


Sideboard: I took out my Thundermaws and Selesnya Charms for Oblivion Ring


Game 2:  We shuffled up and right as we attempted to present we were hit with the dreaded mid round deck check.  This almost tilted me a bit as I had just gotten demolished in Game 1 and was anxious to see my opening 7 with the post board configuration.  Fortunately everything came back fine and we shuffled up once again.  My opponent mulliganed to 6 and keep what he later described as a “Risky but high potential” hand.  Unfortunately


Game 3:  This game my opponent kept another risky hand but it worked out a little better for him.  Unfortunately for him


**2-1 (6-0)**



**Round 7: GR Aggro**


Game 1:  My opponent had an awkward


Sideboard: I boarded out Thundermaws and some Bonfires (they seem impossible to make work as most of his stuff ends up having 3+ toughness and I haven’t quite had much miracle luck all day) in favor of Oblivion Ring


Game 2: My opponent came out of the gates swinging and my mulligan to 6 was sadly a turn or so two slow to compete with the sheer power of his curve.  I shrugged it off and moved to the next game.


Game 3:  This was a very close game where we got into a racing situation.  I was getting a bit land flooded but was taking advantage of it with Wolf Run.  I needed a Selesnya Charm to stay in the game


**1-2 (6-1)**



**Round 8: Junk Rites**


Game 1:  My opponent had a sketchy start and I had a string of Bonfires and Selesnya charms to deal with his mana dorks and large monsters.  He seemed a bit frustrated and quickly moved to sideboard.


Sideboard: My plan remained the same as it was in earlier rounds vs Junk Rites.


Game 2: My opponent paid me back a bit this time as my deck stumbled and was crushed by a string of Acidic Slime triggers.  Sometimes you just can’t keep the appropriate lands on the board if they draw enough of their LD package.


Game 3: This was a close game for a while where I was applying a lot of pressure but he kept bouncing back with Angel of Serenity and Thragtusk.  Eventually he was able to reanimate a second Angel of Serenity (I never drew RIP)


My opponent was able to crack me for 10 in the air and put me into a dead-on-board situation.  Fortunately


**2-1 (7-1)**



**Round 9: Aristocrats Act 2**


This round was my win and in feature match against Ben Friedman.  I was a bit intimidated going into this match


Game 1:  He had a slow start this game and I was able to settle into a Thragtusk blinking plan without a spot removal spell in sight to slip me up.  I believe I was able to Selesnya Charm a Falkenrath Aristocrat that picked up a +1/+1 counter from a Doomed Traveler to seal the deal.


Sideboard:  I was still a bit unsure how to sideboard for this match, Searing Spear and 2 Rest in Peace.  I kept the Selesnya Charms for the possibility of mising Falkenrath Aristocrats, Thundermaws and Obzedats.  


Game 2:  I was able to Thragtusk a number of times


Game 3:  This game I drew an inordinately large number of removal spells and not nearly enough threats.  I think I was able to hardcast 2 of my 3 Bonfires and Spear down a couple of solo Aristocrats.  Eventually we got to a point in the match where I had him dead if I miracled my last Bonfire over the course of 2-3 turns, but it was round 9 and I was certainly feeling the haze of many long battles at this point.


**1-2 (7-2)**



After the dust settled


Overall I had a great time playing in the WMCQ and met a lot of interesting players.  I knew luck was certainly on my side (I think I only mulliganed twice in 9 rounds) to get that far

1363120604.0,1a63x1,[Standard] Can RUG Flash be a deck?,jeffhoogland,46,3,74,"Some background

The deck's core threats are:

* Yeva
* Wolfir Avenger
* Huntmaster of the Fells
* Snapcaster Mage

Supported by counter magic and burn spells. Could there be something to this arch type? Is it simply a ""bad"" UWR flash deck?

I played a variation of RUG Flash this weekend at SCG Indy and managed to go 8-3 in 11 rounds for a top 64 finish. Two of the rounds I lost were to land screw in game 3 and the third round I felt like I thoroughly punted in game 3. 

Esper control feels like a good match up and if you mulligan correctly I think this list can dominate aggro decks. Midrange gets dicey - which might make this a poor deck choice right now. What do we think spikes? I feel like there could be something worth playing here.

I realized shortly after resolving it for the first time just how insane this card is. The power level is nuts to say the least.

We've seen a couple of UWr decks featuring 1-2 copies of Aetherling and then this past weekend a BUG Control deck was playing a single copy in their main deck.

My question to you is this - what do you think is (or could be) the best deck in standard featuring Aetherling as a finisher (and why)? I feel like this is the ""bomb"" true control decks have been waiting for since we lost the titan cycle.

I've changed: **Man he is suck a sack
Into: **What did I screw up last game?** If I felt like I made all the right plays - maybe my mistake was at the start **Should I have mulliganed that hand?**

Losing gracefully is hardest when it comes at the hands of a quick aggro/combo deck. Not going to lie - the first year I spent playing competitive magic I was a turd and often refused to shake the hand of a player that killed me before turn 4 (Charbelcher ack!).

3 Sphinx's Revelation

2 Syncopate

4 Think Twice

2 Turn

2 Warleader's Helix

3 Pillar of Flame

1 Supreme Verdict


Restoration Angel - 3W
When looking to create Value, namely Augur of Bolas. It can also function as a 4 Mana Snapcaster Mage provided you've used one already and kept it on the board. It's very important to know WHEN to use your Angels. You only have 4, and you're really counting on it to swing through and win you the game. Try to be extremely conservative with the Angels unless you have both the hand and knowledge to create an opportunity.

Augur of Bolas - 1U
In the Flash deck, and also helps you dig for an appropriate answer off the top of your deck. He can also be recycled for his Enter the Battlefield effect with Restoration Angel.

Moorland Haunt - Land UW(T).
With no large win conditions in the main 60, allowing them to have a much higher success rate of swinging in and doing some damage.

AEtherling - 4UU
Your big haymaker. When played correctly, and just generally does a great job at protecting both himself and you. More talk on him later, much like Countermagic and Snapcaster.


Assemble the Legion - 3WR
Playable as another vein of win condition. As soon as this card hits the field it puts a very intimidating clock on your opponent (although not nearly as fast as AEtherling) and is generally as hard


Desolate Lighthouse - Land 1UR(T)
While not as directly influential as Moorland Haunt is in the Flash variant, thin out the chaff, and reach a win condition or Sphinx's Revelation.

At the last few events I’ve also met a pile of folks who lurk/post on here – always fun! If you see me at an event please feel free to introduce yourself.

Anywho – still playing the Loam deck in legacy

**Round 1 – Elves**

There are few things that make me happier when playing Loam than seeing my opponent’s first turn play be *Forest -&gt; Llanowar Elves*. Main deck Chalice of the Void

Sadly in game one I did not have any of the awesome cards I just listed. When my opponent tried to combo out with Glimpse of Nature

In game two he promptly scooped to my turn one Chalice of the Void on one.

1 – 0

**Round 2 – Gerry Thompson with Nivmagus Elemental Combo**

Gerry was playing a brew that seemed similar to the Nivmagus combo deck his team had played at the modern PT last year. He probed me on turn one and saw my slightly greedy keep – my hand contained a Chalice, Confidant, Library, Burning Wish and one very lonely land. After pondering he shipped the turn back to me.

Being the luck sack that I am

The reason Gerry scooped when he did was to make it difficult for me to side board. I assumed he was on a combo deck of some sort so I mistakenly boarded out my Abrupt Decays. Thankfully I left in my Maze of Ith – just in case he was some new form of Show and Tell deck. He scooped to Maze on turn 5 in our second game.

2 – 0

**Round 3 – Charbelcher**

This is one of the very few legacy decks that really punishes players who do not sling Force of Wills. Thankfully it is also a fairly inconsistent deck – so it often does not do well in large events. That being said

I win the die roll and mulligan to six. I keep a fairly balanced hand that has a turn 2 Gaddock Teeg, use my forest to cycle a land, untap, play a Plateau and put my Gaddock Teeg on the table.

I have a Teeg in play and a Dreams in my hand – I’m winning this game easy right? *Nope.* While I had a third land in hand I did not yet have a second red source. Plateau was the only red mana in my opening hand and both my cycle and my draw step missed. That means with Teeg blocking a goblin each turn I have two more draw steps to hit any of the following outs:

* 4 Wooded Foothils
* 4 Mox Diamond
* 2 Tiaga 
* 1 Badlands
* 2 Grove of the Burnwillows

Sadly

In game two I played a turn 1 Gaddock Teeg on the play

In game three I was on the draw. After we had both agreed to keep our seven card hands I asked the question many legacy players have asked over the years:

*”Am I dead yet?”*

My Belcher opponent laughed

My seven card hand contained a turn 1 Chalice of the Void

2 – 1

**Round 4 – ANT**

This round was against a player that had knocked me out of a PTQ top 8 in Indy a few weeks previous (mulligan to five and flooded out in game three). He won the whole thing though – so congrats Andrew!

That being said – he took some risky lines in our first game and got rewarded instead of punished. I had no idea what he was playing and I ended up keeping a six card hand that was good against fair decks. He kept a seven card hand that involved him probing me and then using a Lotus Petal to cast a Ponder in order to hit his first land drop. A few turns down the line I had no pressure on the table and no cards in hand. He deemed it necessary to try and “go off” with Past in Flames

In game two I had a seven that was very good. Turn one I played a Chalice for One off of a Mox Diamond and a Wasteland. I followed it up with a Chalice for Zero that same turn. He packed it in.

In game three I kept a six card hand that contained three lands

2 – 2

**Round 5 – UR Delver**

This is one of those matches that ended the minute I resolved my Chalice of the Void on one. The only tricky thing to play around once I stuck that is Price of Progress (hint: you can wasteland yourself in response).

Took this match down in a quick 2-0

3 – 2

**Round 6 – High Tide**

Another die roll won

I learned a valuable lesson from this first game – when you are unsure which mono-blue deck they are playing

Games two and three I ended up winning because I played out multiple Chalice of the Void on one and then Abrupt Decay’d my own Chalice when he tried to Echoing Truth all of them.

Oh and in game three I got to Slaughter Games his High Tides :D

4 – 2

**Round 7 – Dredge**

My opponent this round 100% should have mulliganed further in our first game. He kept a 5 that did actual nothing without top decking a land. I on the other hand kept a six that had a turn 1 Sylvan Library

Game two it was my turn to screw up my mulligans – I kept a hand that was a *very* poor choice against Dredge on the draw. I died very quickly.

Game three I mulliganed aggressively and was rewarded. My opponent dumping his opening hand with an LED and then used a Faithless Looting to dredge a pile of cards, Thalia and Wasteland later the game was locked up.

5 – 2

**Round 8 – Hive Mind**

Whew! I hadn’t played against this much combo in a long time.  Thankfully I knew what this guy was playing and my seven was well equipped to battle it. I won the die roll and had a turn 1 Sylvan Library into a turn 2 Burning Wish for Thoughtseize to take out one of his combo pieces. He fumbled around with cantrips for a while trying to assemble his three card combo. He did not find all of his pieces before I cast a Slaughter Games taking out his Hive Minds. 

In game two he had a turn two kill on the play. I kept a hand that had disruption

In game three I led with a turn 1 Thalia on the play. My little hate bear in conjunction with Wastelands lead me to victory.

6 – 2

**Round 9 – BG Pox**

I was relieved to be playing against a fair deck for this last round. Even though I can hold my own against combo decks – those matches are always nail biters. I much prefer a good

In game one he kept a land light hand that was only non-basics. I punished this with a few Wastelands and then clocked him out with a Knight.

In game two he tore apart my hand and killed my Dark Confidant. Thankfully he did not have land disruption as well and my Nantuko Monastery was able to race his Cursed Scrolled easily.

7 – 2

**Wrap Up**

I’m still enjoying playing the Loam deck and I’ve still be doing well with even though most people know when I am playing when I sit down across from them. If you enjoy playing grindy

Sadly I do not have any more standard/legacy events until the New Jersey SCG Invitational at the end of July (which I will be testing Dark Depths+Stage for). I’m off to figure out MM sealed before this weekend so I don’t waste my three byes at GP Vegas!

P.S. [u/DarkM27]( http://www.reddit.com/user/Darkm27) is one of the guys who grinds the Midwest with me. He made top 8 this past weekend playing a [BUG Walkers]( http://sales.starcitygames.com//deckdatabase/displaydeck.php?DeckID=56688) deck we built in about 20 minutes in the hotel the night before.

When you first cast him, and that something is dreadbore.  Wow.   Now that you've already gotten roughly your card's worth, he sticks around for at least one turn and is freaking huge.  They are probably not attacking profitably on their turn unless they kill him (+1 cards).

Assuming he survives until your upkeep

God help them if you ever get 6 in the yard

Other things to like:

* Great in an attrition war when you are likely to break 6 in the yard naturally.
* Blocks 5 power no problem.  This is where a lot of the other ""huge"" creatures in standard are.
* Plays really well with both of Domri Rade's abilities.  Domri always wanted a shriekmaw to play with in standard and this is a doozy.  Might even work in modern.

As you all know, or if I would rather have a mana base filled with powerful utility lands that is somewhat inconsistent.


Take [this deck](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/azorius-aggro-01-04-13-1/) for example, the deck is almost mono-white, but splashed blue for a few cards.


The first 8 lands of out 22 card mana-base are easy enough


3 Cavern of Souls seems like a good choice since it fixes our mana and at 3 we are fairly likely to see at least 1 copy each game. With 11 slots left


Testing the deck with this mana reveals that we almost always have the colors we need


We only need the blue sources for 6 cards in the main deck


In testing we still consistently have our colors so we cut 1 plains to add a moorland haunt


Now when we test the deck we have our colors most of the time


In summation

So

Cost: 1B. Very efficient for what we want it to do. Gets rid of a troublesome guy, we're likely to gain much more of an advantage than that. 

Type: Instant - Yes

Rules Text: Destroy target mono-colored creature.
Now here's where people start to let their imagination run wild. ""Oh no

This is not the case. This card is only a dead card versus one real contender in the field, Huntsmaster, Aristocrat aren't valid targets.

Yes, very miniscule chance of making it even a 1-2 spread. Jund deals with tempo-aggro decks absolutely terribly, and that is where this card best finds a home. 

So what parts of Jund's deck most heavily interact with our creaturebase and gameplan? Thundermaw Hellkite, but that's fine. Thundermaw Hellkite just kills us, and it has the potential to be a one-sided sweeper with a body, haste, and no drawback. We can usually keep counter mana up for him, and that's fine. But he also can be cast off a Cavern. 

I know it seems like a long shot, maybe two. Two of these have hexproof, making it a moot point (Sigarda and Geist, things a list similar to the 5k 1st would not have trouble dealing with due to piked souls or other various dudes). Also, Armada Wurm's token is only green, and is a viable target for this card as well. This is card disadvantage, so let's think about that

I would also like to stress a final point. Card disadvantage is always bad for you. It is NOT always the incorrect decision! People are so slow to use cards that are not innately card advantageous because they think that means that card is just bad. That's not correct! I never feel bad for using Ultimate Price on a swinging Thragtusk. Yeah he gets a 3/3 dude, and I have 2 less power to worry about. The token also is easily blocked by a flashed restoration angel, providing more of that precious tempo advantage we are looking for.

This card (and the deck it finds its best home in) are worth your consideration! But I want to hear your opinions as well. What were your reasons for dismissing Ultimate Price? Do you think you were wrong to do so? Is Dreadbore really a necessity? Does the format merit playing instant speed removal?

Previously, which is usually Missed Trigger instead). That infraction's been removed and its language has been folded into a clause that allows upgrading the penalty on Game Rule Violation.

**Extra cards in the deckbox**

You probably know (or should know) that if you have extra cards in your deckbox when you're being deck checked, of varying levels of formality, for things like copies of your double-faced cards, or storing a promo card that you got at the tournament.

Now that's laid out formally in the IPG. So long as they're not sleeved the same as the rest of the deck

* Promotional cards that have been handed out as part of the tournament.
* Double-faced cards represented by checklist cards in the deck.
* Double-faced cards being used to represent the ‘night’ side of cards in the deck.

**And one more thing**

Well, a Zenith in the graveyard instead of shuffled in), we can ""partial fix"" by putting it in the correct zone. Used to be that was allowed within a turn cycle of the error. Now it's just within a turn.

And that's basically it. There were some changes in the Tournament Rules, as well as a flat ""no"" on using video replay to make rulings, but the IPG changes are the ones most likely to actually impact you, so please be aware of them as you head out to events this weekend.",,False,,False,t3_111d4v

As has been suggested, we are trying to condense our competitive budget discussion into one place on a weekly basis.  
  
This is the place where we discuss budget-conscious spikes and their needs for competitive magic.  Maybe it's a card consideration given an X dollar budget.

1373932576.0,1idk4q,[Standard] Bant Hexproof in a Post M14 Meta,Ryuoka,39,7,35,"M14 brought a lot of changes for Bant Hexproof

I've played the deck for a couple months now at several competitive REL events to good results

**--- New Goodies ---**

**Gladecover Scout**: One of the obvious cards to talk about, in multiples, and any time you draw it past turn 2. It does add much consistency to being able to find hexproof guys.

**Witchstalker**: The other new hexproof creature. I can't say I'm overly impressed with this creature however. As a 3-drop, whereas Geist is a 2/2 hexproof that swings for 6. I have actually been considering Fiendslayer Paladin as an alternative

**Fiendslayer Paladin**: I really like this card. It naturally has lifelink and first strike, having real abilities and almost-hexproof makes it better in my opinion.

Other cards I have seen people consider: 

**Trollhide**: At 2 mana this might be playable

**Ajani's Chosen**: No. Despite the Enchantment synergy

**Illusionary Armor**: 5 mana



**--- Hate Cards ---**

**Ratchet Bomb**: At 2 mana, clearing all Rancors, Ethereal Armors, and Gladecover Scouts on Turn 3.

**Celestial Flare**: This could be a very effective hate card for hexproof. At 2 mana (albeit a demanding WW)

Despite all this

**--- Tentative Decklist ---**

**Creatures (19)**

* 3 Avacyn's Pilgrim (need even more white mana for Fiendslayer Paladin)
* 4 Gladecover Scout (not sure if 4 is a correct number
* 4 Invisible Stalker
* 4 Geist of Saint Traft
* 4 Fiendslayer Paladin (4 may be overly ambitious

**Spells (3)**

* 3 Simic Charm

**The rest of it (38)**

* 16 Enchantments
* 22 Land

**Cards in contention**:

* Voice of Resurgence - defense against offensive decks
* Fencing Ace - still kills them faster than any hexproof threat
* Strangleroot Geist - probably sideboard
* Loxodon Smiter - never saw the appeal of this card and never ran it
* Witchstalker - although hexproof
* Silverblade Paladin - everyone loves doublestrike
* Ajani - gives flying+doublestrike to a creature for 3 mana
* Selesnya Charm - +2/+2 trample is nice, so +3/+3 is just better. With less hexproof threats the 3rd mode gets worse, but can still protect enchantments from Ray or Abrupt Decay

Potential Changes:

* Cut 1 Gladecover Scout and 1 Fiendslayer and add 2x of cards in contention? Pros: get more diverse threats, fewer hexproof threats (unless Witchstalker is added).

* Cut some number (1x?) of Simic Charms. Pros: could run more threats now that the hexproof mode is less relevant. Cons: lose versatile card

* ???

1364750053.0,1bd6kz,Junk Rites pilots: We're public enemy number one now. How do we adapt?,abutterfly,47,16,52,"**My last list

It should go without saying that Junk Rites is one of, based on a decision to play my favorite cards in the format, and build a deck in which nearly every card was a source of card advantage. Making a few tweaks, I arrived at a list very similar to the top lists we're seeing now. Previously, decks I'd taken to large tournaments had been sub-par due to my own self-imposed mental restrictions. Having beaten that barrier, I'm both excited to see my deck choice performing so well and made nervous because I know the field is going to be looking to beat this deck specifically. 

___


So, similar to Melissa DeTora's [Wolf Run Bant revision](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=11090). The proposed list plays the same advantage-generating creatures we do, but opts for permission cards instead of the digging engines and utility cards we play. This is...troubling. The deck obviously has no difficult generating as much advantage as we do, and a Sphinx's Rev or two makes it very difficult to beat. 

How should we beat this? Do we tune the deck to operate faster, 1 side? 

---

Let's talk card options. Many of our lists look very similar


**Land Count**: I was as high as 25, it's not often a move I feel comfortable making. Those of you with low lands, high dorks: How has your mana situation been?

**Mana Dorks**: This goes hand in hand with the previous paragraph, our playset of Avacyn's Pilgrims should be filled out before our Arbor Elves. I've been playing only 4 Pilgrims, no Elves. How have the Elf lists been performing? Are the extra dorks necessary to the deck? Could Farseek be a potential replacement?

**Liliana of the Veil** This is where my unused Elf slots have gone, but she certainly has been effective to some extent. Coupled with Lingering Souls and Centaur Healers, she provides us another option for us to stabilize with 3 mana against control.

**Lingering Souls**: This card has been popping in and out of mainboards. I think it's too crucial to the deck's advantage engine to cut entirely

**Sever the Bloodline**: I have not played with this card yet, and a very important removal spell, allows the deck to operate without disrupting its search engine. How many ought we play between the main and side?

**Abrupt Decay**: In the main, Liliana of the Veil, Snapcaster Mage, any of Naya Blitz's creatures. Which decks is it least effective against in the main? I'm looking to play a total of 3 in the 75.

**Random techy shit: Cloudshift** Hitting Angel of Serenity with it is cool, I'd like to play 2, but it's still a card that relies on others to be effective. It will probably not make the cut. 

---

I'll try to edit this section to add a sideboard discussion in a bit, most important part of Standard metagaming, once you have a top-tier deck in your hands, so I'd love to start out with some discussion about that as well.

---

Quick blurbs on sideboard cards and ideas that I'll expand throughout the day:

**Golgari Charm** : Incredibly versatile against UWx. ""Counters"" a Verdict


**Loxodon Smiter** : If Bant is the deck to beat

**Obzedat


**Acidic Slime** : Haven't played this card either

**Abrupt Decay** : I've been attempting to play 3 of these. Do these get replaced by Slime?

**Deathrite Shaman** : He's a Swiss Army Knife

1363572731.0,1ai0my,[Modern] Let's talk about Eggs.,Falcon_Cunt_Punch,53,19,103,"If you saw GP San Diego then you just saw the eggs pilot rip through two of the highest ranked pro's in modern. You saw him beat Kibler when Kibler had two lands in play

But most of all you watched the most boring games of Magic I have literally ever seen.

Let's go over some shit. The Eggs pilot did not stall the game. He won his games in between other games

During the semi-finals the table had TWO spectators. Both of the Marshall's were constantly commenting on how boring it was to watch the Eggs match up.

Brian Kibler wrote ""F6"" on a piece of paper and got up from his table while the Eggs deck combo'd off. For those of you unaware F6 on MODO means ""pass priority"". So Kibler was basically being extremely rude to the pilot. He did the same at the previous PTQ

Reshape + Lotus Bloom is essentially Tinker + Black Lotus in modern

Let me quickly state that I am not for Eggs being banned at this point in time. I think this GP is going to be a real eye opener for anyone participating in Modern to be better prepared for Eggs in the future. Rest In Peace/Extirpate can go a long way and it's very clear by many main deck choices that people didn't expect Eggs to sweep the way it did.",,t5_2utkz,1363573402.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1ai0my/modern_lets_talk_about_eggs/
1361758978.0,19617c,[Modern] Kiki-Pod PTQ Report,fumar,35,5,20,"I played [this version](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/kiki-pod-24-02-13-1/) of Kiki Pod Saturday at a PTQ. For those of you unfamiliar with the achetype

Some of the wrinkles in the maindeck: -1 Wall of Roots for +1 Wall of Omens (to help against the grindy control decks), -1 Izzet Staticaster for +1 Deceiver Exarch. The 2nd Exarch was amazing for me, early game you can go from Wall of Roots/Omens to a 4 drop on the same turn if you have to and late game you can still kill on a cmc 1 and a cmc 2 creature, at least 4 mana, Pod, and at least 9 life, plus you can get the rare kill with 2 cmc 2 creatures (most people don't see this coming). 

On to the event!

**Round 1**

My opponent is on UWR Flash and game 1 is relatively bland with me resolving a Pod and grinding him down with Kitchen Finks podded into Restoration Angel repeatedly. 

I sideboarded +2 Qasali Pridemage, -1 Murderous Redcap, -1 Linvala, -1 Aven Mindcensor, -1 Bird of Paradise. Most decks have some sort of Torpor Orb/Pithing Needle/Stony Silence hate they bring in so Qasali Pridemage comes in in almost every matchup. 

Game 2 I play the midrange plan and eventually kill my opponent with powerful cards and incremental advantage. Honestly

**Round 2** 

My opponent is on Bogle (GW Auras). Game 1 I'm on the play and turn 1 Hierarch into turn 2 Wall of Roots while he goes turn 1 Hexproof dude, pod it for Resto Angel and kill him next turn podding Angel for Conscripts (untap Pod), Pod Finks for Resto (flicker Conscripts), untap pod with Conscripts, Pod Resto for Kiki-Jiki. In come the Paths and the Pridemages, out go Wall of Omens, Mindcensor, and Redcap. 

Game 2 he puts a lot of pressure on me with a double rancor'ed hexproofer. I am at 2 with Birds, and Birds, Restoration Angel, Kiki Jiki in hand. He has a Spirit Mantle on his Hexproofer, another Bogle and a Dryad Arbor in play. I play my Birds and pass with 3 lands open. He attacks (his hand was empty) with everything and I flicker my Sliver before blockers, killing the Spirit Mantle, I block the 5/1 with 0/4 Wall of Roots

2-0

**Round 3**

My opponent is on Infect and I'm on the play. I go turn 1 Hierarch, he then moves to combat and I attempt to tap his Agent down with Deceiver but he has the Apostles Blessing and I'm dead. Nice turn 3 kill &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;


Sideboarding I brought in the Dispels, and Paths for -2 Kitchen Finks, -1 Aven Mindcensor, -1 Chord of Calling, -1 Linvala, , and -1 Restoration Angel.

Game 2 I had a similar opening with him hitting with a turn 1 Glisener Elf except turn 3 I played Pod

2-1

**Round 4**

The Kiki-Pod mirror. Game 1 my opponent played a turn 2 pod of Noble Hierarch which I punished with a turn 3 Pod (Bird and Wall of Roots in play) saccing Wall of Roots for Harmonic Sliver. He follows this up with a Qasali Pridemage next turn on my pod. I draw Pod and turn Harmonic Sliver into Linvala. Two turns later I kill him after he Chorded for Phantasmal Image on Linvala and I untap and kill with a 2 and a 1 drop. 

Game 2 I keep a loose hand with just Bird

Game 3 he makes a misplay and I punish him for it. This game was an utter clusterfuck and I barely remember anything from it other than I won. 

**Round 5**

My opponent is on Affinity and drops a turn 1 Vault Skirge and Ornithopter followed by a turn 2 Steel Overseer. I went turn 1 Bird into turn 2 Wall of Roots. He plays another Skirge and then hits me for 5 in the air from the Overseer activation. I cast Pod into Harmonic Sliver and kill the Overseer. He hits me for 5 again and I'm at 7. Next turn I Pod the Bird into a Phantasmal Image to blow up both of his Vault Skirges as a copied Harmonic Sliver (we had about a 4 minute delay as I had to call a judge to explain the interaction to my opponent). I go to 6 from the Ornithoper then cast Kitchen Finks (go to 8) Pod away Finks (at 10) and then flicker it with Restoration Angel (go to 12) my opponent top decks Cranial Plating with 5 artifacts on the field but it doesn't matter. I kill him the following turn with a Googol of Restoration Angels. 

In come the Paths, and Staticaster. 

Game 2 is a similar story with my opponent doing very little against my Wall of Omens as he opened up with Memnite and Signal Pest. I follow it up with a Pod for Kitchen Finks and two turns later he's dead despite casting Blood Moon.

**Round  6**

I heard whispers from my friends before the tournament about Mono Blue Tron but I had no idea what to expect when I saw my opponent go turn 1 Island turn 2 Urza's Tower. Regardless

In comes Avalanche Riders + Paths and Pridemages, 2 Kitchen Finks, and Murderous Redcap.  

Game two he plays two tron pieces and turn 1 map. I played a bird turn 1 and then fetched for a shock and passed turn 2. He failed to crack his map on his turn or in response to my fetch (I have no idea why people wait to do this EOT) so I punish him by flashing in Aven Mindcensor and he fails to find. He plays an Island next turn and passes. I attempt to cast Pod but get Remanded. He top decks his tron piece and cast's Sundering Titan killing all my lands. I Path his Titan next turn (blowing up his Island) off Birds

Game 3 I keep a hand that's dorks, Kiki, or Phantasmal Image) and start beating for 2 until he casts Solemn. He reassembles Tron and casts Platinum Angel. I proceed to top deck Kiki-Jiki to break up his tron again. He puts me to 10 via Angel while I strip mine him every turn while drawing Aven Mindcensor, locking him out of tutors. I finally draw Chord of Calling and cast it for Phantasmal Image copying his Angel. I proceed to beat him down with a 5/5 angel via Noble Hierarch and then draw a Pridemage to beat him down to 4 and threaten to kill him next turn on turn 1 before we draw. Next turn I pop the pridemage and kill him with the Phantasmal Image. 

**Round 7**

I'm in 6th going into this round and am unfortunately paired against the player in 8th in a win and in. He's on Splinter Twin (with green splash). Game 1 I am forced to mull to 4 on the play while he keeps 7. I keep Bird, Linvala. He plays turn 2 Spellskite and I top deck a Hierarch. He passes on turn 3 and in my upkeep taps my Bird down with Pestermite. I Phantasmal Image his Spellskite and he seems quite unhappy (I assume he has Twin in hand). He starts searching for answers and passes while I top deck a land and slam Linvala on the field. He Remands a Restoration Angel twice but eventually it sticks as does another Angel and the Angel beatdown plan begins. He filters 3 Dispels from his and and eventually casts 2 Izzet Charms on my Linvala. I Spellskite the 2nd one (causing my Image to die) and he dies the next turn to Angel beatdown.

In comes the Dispels, the Combusts, and the Staticaster. 

Game 2 I die terribly with a loose keep.

Game 3 I draw all my removal and a Dispel. I resolve a Pod and Pod for Finks followed by Podding Finks for Resto turn 4. Turn 5 he Grudges my Pod and then taps down a land in my upkeep via Pestermite. He attempts to Kiki me and I path his Kiki in response. Next turn I top deck a Chord

**Top 8 R1**

I had the #1 seed going in and knew I was playing against RBg Burn. Game 1 he kills me with burn followed up by Deathrites to seal the game a turn before I would kill him. 

In come 2 Obstinate Baloth

Game 2 I slow him down with Wall of Roots followed up by a pod into Kitchen Finks. Next turn I pod the Finks away but he eats it with the persist trigger on the stack

Game 3 He opens with Vexing Devil and I opt to take the 4. He top decks Goblin Guide and puts me to 18 after I played Grove and Birds. He follows this up with another Devil which I again opt to take the 4 so I can play Wall of Roots (followed by t3 Deceiver and turn 4 Kiki). He attacks into my Wall with Guide and then Searing Blazes me to 7 and casts Deathrite. I EOT fetch to go to 6 and then cast Finks to go to 8

I sided out Linvala and Redcap against Burn as I didn't consider Deathrite to be the main threat. This was clearly wrong and I was punished for it. The matchup is extremely difficult anyway as Pod LOVES killing itself (I've done 16 damage to myself before).",,t5_2utkz,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/19617c/modern_kikipod_ptq_report/

I stop, and cast the 1W +1/+1 and flying/first strike on my thunderfist, or die) Opp says ""so that would put me at 1?"" I look at his spindown - 8.

 At this point, I am a little miffed, because the burden of proof is being placed solely on me only because my opponent does not care to write down life totals, but instead use a die (wtf). Nevertheless, I show my math. [Judge] states ""I believe you are taking advantage of your opponents lack of proper life total tracking, and I am going to have to DQ you"". I first point out, that no matter if he is at 7 or 8, and says again he is DQing me. I then ask Andrew ""are you accusing me of cheating?"" he responds ""yes"". I respond (I admit a bit hastily) ""Go fuck yourself"". What transpired afterwards was pretty much an insistence on [Judge]'s part that I am a cheater

**Round 3** vs. Bob Thompson (Affinity) 2-0

I was very excited to get the tournament underway.  Bob mulliganed to 6 while I kept my opening 7.  He led with Inkmoth Nexus, Loxodon Smiter.  He still had no follow-up play, again missing a land drop.  A turn 3 Wilt-Leaf Liege from me led to an early concession as he was facing down a 6/6 Loxodon Smiter.  

For game 2, and Kataki, War's Wage all came in.  My opening 7 was very nice, consisting of both Kataki and Stony Silence.  My opponent also kept on 7, playing Inkmoth Nexus, Memnite, Memnite, Birds of Paradise.  He then played Inkmoth Nexus, War's Wage.  Bob shook his head at that and sacrificed all of his artifacts on his third turn's upkeep.  He then played a third Inkmoth Nexus and attempted to attack me with one of them.  I pointed out that Blood Moon made them all Mountains

Game 3 was more of the same as my Lingering Souls proved better than his Lingering Souls backed by Gaddock Teeg and Thalia

**Round 5** vs. Lawrence Wight (Living End) 2-0

The only damage I took in this entire match were off my own lands.  In game 1 he cycled a bunch of creatures and never found a cascade spell.  

In game 2 I brought in Chalice of the Void, and Rule of Law.  Needless to say, that did not end well for him.  

5-0

**Round 6** vs. Melissa DeTora (BW Tokens) 1-1-1  

This one was a very interesting match.  Both of us had powerful spells to back up Lingering Souls and the games were interactive.  

I took game 1 despite Melissa casting multiple Auriok Champions.  I distinctly recall Orzhov Pontiff eating her entire team and allowing me to kill her from 17 life.  

In game 2 she correctly identified the power of Orzhov Pontiff and it was promptly Tidehollow Sculler'd out of my hand

Game 3 saw a turn 2 Gaddock Teeg eat an early Dismember as she had double Windbrisk Heights followed by a Spectral Procession.  I was forced to Path one of the Spirits before combat to prevent the Heights from getting activated.  We traded blows down to 3 and 7 life respectively before turn 5 on time came

5-0-1  

**Round 7** vs. Franz Ombico (Scapeshift) 2-0  

My opponent led with Blood Crypt and Overgrown Tomb into Prismatic Omen, as I ate his Bob with an Orzhov Pontiff.  A Jund Charm as Pyrcolasm during my turn 4 attack step slowed down my assault, but was ultimately futile.  

The Jund Charm and Bob had me confused as I had not seen anyone play those in Scapeshift recently.  He cast a few ramp spells as well as Prismatic Omen, but failed to take account of the lifegain I had with Deathrite Shaman, ending the game at 1 life.

6-0-1 

**Round 8** vs. Omar Beldon (Jund) 2-0  

Finally, fetching double Baneslayer Angel to seal the game.  

In game 2 he brought in some really strange cards like Slaughter Pact and Thragtusk

And with that I locked myself in for day 2

P.S. English isn't my first language

----------

**[P1p01](http://i.imgur.com/B8cCiZ9.jpg)**: This wasn't an easy first pick. No huge bombs, but on the plus side, I'm almost guaranteed to wheel something decent for any of those decks. I finally settled on Mystic Genesis here with 3 seconds on the timer because it's a huge hit in the midgame and Simic is my favorite guild so far. I think it's the best Simic card here, but I could have gone Boros/Gruul with Martial Glory or the very overrated Madcap Skills.

**[P1p02](http://i.imgur.com/XvCAqaB.jpg)**: And now I hate my first pick. Couple of decent Simic cards here (Frilled Oculus

**[P1p03](http://i.imgur.com/sLfZya6.jpg)**: As usual, Slaughterhorn and even Spell Rupture. My pick here is Sapphire Drake as he is a fantastic finisher in a good Simic deck. I hope to table something, probably the Spell Rupture, but one can always hope for Slaughterhorn or the overcosted Merfolk guy.

**[P1p04](http://i.imgur.com/Nv4Ikpp.jpg)**: Decent cards in every colour except Gruul. Two good Boros 2-drops but at this point I think I'd rather follow the signal from p3 and grab the card that is the backbone of every good simic deck: Cloudfin Raptor! I'd really like to wheel the Snapjaw here but I think it's asking too much with all the crap in the pack.

**[P1p05](http://i.imgur.com/4MIZNcI.jpg)**: Pretty strong signal for Orzhov being open here, but finally went for the semi-removal (which I hate more and more everytime I play it). I think BoS was the pick here, or switch colors and go Orzhov.

**[P1p06](http://i.imgur.com/HC0AuZm.jpg)**: And now Gruul is showing up all over the place

**[P1p07](http://i.imgur.com/tWnZdhB.jpg)**: Pretty awful pack here

**[P1P08](http://i.imgur.com/HS7ygfV.jpg)**: This pack is pretty much empty except for the Gateway Shade (those kind of cards are always pretty good in heavy black decks) and the goblin (good in Boros aggro). I pick the beefy scarab in hopes to send a signal again.

**[P1p09](http://i.imgur.com/174UAjw.jpg)**: Let's see what went around the table... 2/5 simic cards and 1/4 for boros. I'll gladly take the Shambleshark here as I think it was the third best simic card in the original pack (only a bit behind Elusive Krasis) and someone is going to be stoked about a very late Martial Glory.

**[P1p10](http://i.imgur.com/z5NTSgB.jpg)**: I tabled the Charger here

**[P1p11](http://i.imgur.com/CcSt8gz.jpg)**: Well I wheeled the crappy cards in my colors. I chose the draw spell

-------

First pack ends without giving me much more playables

-------

**[P2p01](http://i.imgur.com/iNCZDum.jpg)**: Well

**[P2p02](http://i.imgur.com/G4yfPnr.jpg)**: Pick for me here are Either Frilled Oculus or Slaughterhorn

**[P2p03](http://i.imgur.com/YIp0e3Z.jpg)**: Again some very late Orzhov goodies here but Simic is a racing deck that doesn't really like Devour Flesh and splashing white is out of the question. I can choose between the Sprite or the Rogue. I was really hurting for 3-drops at that point so I went with the rogue.

**[P2p04](http://i.imgur.com/xKY4sVl.jpg)**: More good Orzhov stuff makes me whish I switched guilds pick 5

**[P2p05](http://i.imgur.com/EqdR2Ac.jpg)**: Simic Fluxmage or Disciple of the Old Ways are the picks here... Had I went for a Red splash

**[P2p06](http://i.imgur.com/EkmIWfa.jpg)**: Not much else for me (or anyone else

**[P2p07](http://i.imgur.com/3F3ZU8c.jpg)**: Drakewing Krasis and it's not even close since I don't have any gates and the flier is an excellent 3-drop.

-------

Not much else for pack 2 except a Greenside Watcher and a Leyline Phantom

-------

**[P3p01](http://i.imgur.com/Pk0MfxY.jpg)**: This is where I really regret not goig Gruul. The red primordial is absolutely brutal in limited. It's a Zealous Conscript on steroids. On the other hand I have 2 really nice cards for my deck here in Simic Charm and Pit Fight. Pit Fight is pretty good removal but the +3/+3 from the charm does this job better in this deck and it's much more flexible. Charm it is

**[P3p02](http://i.imgur.com/qs2Ge54.jpg)**: Does this pack seem familiar to you? Well see above for explanations. Hope I wheel Agoraphobia or the rogue

**[P3p03](http://i.imgur.com/L47Hdsi.jpg)**: Well. I don't know what the guys before me picked, but I feel bad nonethless.

**[P3P04](http://i.imgur.com/qEKrOkC.jpg)**: Here the pick is between the 3-drops. I like the Krasis a lot

**[P3p05](http://i.imgur.com/WiUs9Uu.jpg)**: Second Keymaster Rogue that I'm probably not going to play or... nothing... I almost hate-picked here since some of those tricks are huge blowouts againt my deck but I still went for the rogue after all was said and done.

**[P3p06](http://i.imgur.com/Jb173uY.jpg)**: Some cards are VERY late in this pack. This is the second super-late Devour Flesh and Hands of Binding hand (I know

**[P3p07](http://i.imgur.com/ckXE19b.jpg)**: Not much for me here. I just hate-pick the removal spell that's wayyyyyy too late again.

**[P3p08](http://i.imgur.com/Br5tveu.jpg)**: As much as I like the shackles for constructed shenanigans

**[P3p09](http://i.imgur.com/v1tzI6o.jpg)**: Well the Rogue did wheel after all!

**P3p10**: failed to screencap here but the Agoraphobia wheeled too!

**[P3p11](http://i.imgur.com/k0ecKyP.jpg)**: And the Gate!

**[P3p12](http://i.imgur.com/WsYrjZt.jpg)**: And the second Gate!!

**P3P13**: Did you really think I got any other playable after those!?

-------

So I think I ended up with an ok deck but I finished the draft with the impression that I should have splashed red or straight up went Gruul or Orzhov since my first couple of packs probably put 2 other drafters in Simic.

**[This is what the deck ended up looking like](http://i.imgur.com/LcQWVjp.jpg)**

It's got quality 2-drops

-------

**Match 1: VS Borzhov**

- Game 1: I'm on the play and keep [my 7](http://i.imgur.com/TjFeTEw.jpg). This is kind of the nuts hand of the deck as long as I draw a land so there is really no question in keeping. I go the agressive way and [start the beats early](http://i.imgur.com/MFXiotY.jpg) while my opponent plays taplands and [not much else](http://i.imgur.com/gD4T14L.jpg). I end up miscalculating something and end an attack phase with my opp [on 1 life](http://i.imgur.com/rwiY0Fp.jpg). Thankfully it didn't matter in the end as I have the [answer to his super-blocker on the next turn](http://i.imgur.com/nFs0imE.jpg).

- Game 2: He opts to play and I have to mull to 6 into a pretty shaky hand

- Game 3: I keep [my 7](http://i.imgur.com/3ZF4SwM.jpg) even tough it lacks a 2-drop and a Forest because it's got my Raptor and a Charm. Things are pretty slow and the second spell I cast is a Mystic Genesis on his Syndicate Enforcer

-------

**Match 2: VS Borzhov

- Game 1: He's on the play and I keep my 7 since it has [all that I need](http://i.imgur.com/rOW2ab9.jpg). We play our creatures and I eventually bait him into blocking my petty fliers with his assault griffin but he's smarter than that and [takes the hit](http://i.imgur.com/YLI79oY.jpg). I think this was a misplay as I should have swung with only the 3/1 to propose the trade. Attacking with the Raptor kind of gave the plan away and was not worth it because I really needed to kill the flier. Anyway I Play a Keymaster Rogue

- Game 2: He plays and I keep [my 7](http://i.imgur.com/z27Sgfh.jpg) which is a bit on the slow end but has great potential if I draw almost anything (sorry for the ""you win"" panel, he drops Assemble the Legion and enough blockers to [slow me down](http://i.imgur.com/NDLpEvA.jpg). I'm on my way to winning in the air regardless when he plays a Martial Glory on his Griffin to block my 4/4 Nimbus Swimmer and I make the tragic mistake of forgetting to bloodrush my Scab-Clan Charger to [save him and kill the bird](http://i.imgur.com/OIWKL9I.jpg)... Fuck me, right? He then killed my Deathcult Rogue and chump-blocked into victory with Assemble the Legion. Well that was bad, I guess the stress of being low on time due to all the screencapping did play a role. Let's try to win game 3 in under 6 minutes, shall we?

- Game 3: Or we could just [get stomped](http://i.imgur.com/oq4AgsP.jpg).

Looking at the red spells from gatecrash


1 Mana:


[Legion Loyalist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=366348): He's definitely not a 1 drop. Obviously, I would play him, but at the moment, I would play [Stromkirk Noble](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=230783) &gt; [Rakdos Cackler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=253596) &gt; [Stonewright](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=239975)/[Legion Loyalist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=366348) (depending on opening hand mana).
That being said, considering your 1 and 2 drops don't usually have enough power to make the trample relevant... I don't know. I honestly just think I don't have room for him. What if they have spot removal? He's then just a 1/1 with haste, which is 1 damage at best.
Do I want to play Worldfire


2 Mana:


[Burning Tree Emissary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=366467): Yes, but that feels like magical christmas land. [Ash Zealot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=253623) is your primary 2 drop, which you can't cast after Burning Tree, and I've honestly been underwhelmed by Lightning Mauler's presence in my RDW.


[Skullcrack](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=366238): Think how many times you use Searing Spear to your opponents face during a match. I would probably then cut those, it doesn't need a win more card.


3 mana:

[Arrows of Justice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=366381): It's an answer to have if they have a Restoration Angel, I prefer to just sideboard in Traitorous Blood and steal their blocker instead.

[Boros Reckoner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=366385): Probably the best addition to RDW. The 3 R cost isn't too harsh, and deal 1 or 2 damage, or if they wish to trade with him, that's minimum 3 damage to their face (or another creature!?). That's like a free searing spear on a 3/3 for 3. The first strike ability is just gravy.
Another point is that if they're a very aggro deck


4 mana:


[Rubblebelt Raiders](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=366462): Hard to justify swapping out Hellrider for this. I feel like this card needs haste to be worth it.

If it untaps, usually. Or they may have cleared your board, in which case it only receives one +1/+1 counter. Needs more testing.


[Scorchwalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=366409): This card should honestly just be in the 3 mana slot. He's 5 damage for 1RR, he's a 5/1 for 4, which is simply put: Will trade with (mostly) anything that blocks it.


[Viashino Shanktail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=366264): A 3/1 first strike for 4 doesn't seem as good as a 5/1 for 4. Also


5 mana:


[Wrecking Ogre] (http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=366446): This card won me most of my games at pre-release. The 5 mana cost is intensive

1375982975.0,1jyuqz,[Discussion] Tool to Analyze your Win Percentages based on Formats/Time,jeffhoogland,36,10,54,"So I've started working on an excel workbook that allows you to import your event history from the [Planeswalker Points site](https://www.wizards.com/Magic/PlaneswalkerPoints/) and then does some number break down for you. It is kind of neat to see how I've improved over the past year.

For instance my win percentages in constructed formats from 2012:

* Format:	All
* Win Percentage (without draws):	60.68181818
* Win Percentage (with draws):	57.9175705

* Win Percentage (with draws):	46.875
	
* Format:	Standard
* Win Percentage (without draws):	62.5

Is this something other people would find useful? If so I'd be interested in having a few other folks see if it works for them as well. 

I've only tested it using my own data so far - so I'm not sure if it will hit formatting snags with people who have lots of years of event history.

**EDIT:** Looks like others are interested in seeing what I am working on. I can confirm the steps listed on the ""instructions"" sheet work on Office 2010.  Github -&gt; https://github.com/JeffHoogland/mtgstats

Another unexpected addition to this deck is the reprint of [Quicken](http://media.wizards.com/images/magic/tcg/products/m14/poi798sjkasd/FkPjIQNnfY_EN.jpg). Slamming a Supreme Verdict on their turn is fantastic (source: Alchemist's Refuge in early Bant Control variants). This one is a 'free' card

I'm posting it here for two reasons--so that those going to KC for the GP will know that it exists, but not quite there.

This deck is fast enough to race combo and resilient enough to stick around in the more grindy matchups. It has trouble against decks that flood the board with small creatures that can chump over and over again

For those of you who are not familiar, as re-buying dredgers and discarding them to him every turn adds up quickly. Everythign you're pitching into your GY you want there anyway, so you aren't always risking anything by going ""all in"" on a Troll. He is, however, susceptible to Path to Exile and Terminate. 

In the board, and Wurmcoil Engine, and has the added bonus of being used off of a dredge. Gnaw to the Bone is bonkers against Burn in this deck, as it can be cast twice or used off of a dredge, and often gains 8+ life. Lavamancer comes in in several matchups--whenever creatures with 1 or 2 toughness are important. Rakdos Charm is the best answer I've found to storm, as it fights both of their game plans. It can exile the GY when they cast Past in Flames, or it can kill them if they empty the Warrens. It also comes in against Twin

Glaring omissions from the Deck are Tarmogoyf and Demigod of Revenge. Goyf would be an excellent beater

I very much want to squeeze Blood Artist into this deck, and then bringing them back and doing it again the next turn. Blood Artist fits perfectly into this plan, but we don't run a sac outlet and he doesn't do much on his own. I have also considered Blasting Station. 

Any feedback is much appreciated. Thanks. ",,t5_2utkz,1372990579.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1hkgv0/modern_zombievine/

[This is the deck I played.](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/gw-aggromidrange/) Some points about card choices:

- I didn't play any copies of Yeva, so I replaced the 2 Yeva with 2 more copies of Wolfir Avenger, putting it up to 3. I wish I had run 4.

- I ran 4 Thragtusks in the 75. This wasn't really where I wanted to be, I know it's a common. I wanted 2 of those in place of 2 of the Thragtusks, since it comes down earlier against the super aggressive matchups. Thankfully I only had to play one Zombies matchup.

- An extra Faith's Shield in the side. That card is really good

- In his most recent article about this deck, and here's my reasoning. You usually won't have anything ridiculous to pair it with right when he hits, since your earlier drops are 1/1's and Thalia. He spent a good deal of time just sitting around this tournament, and while he occasionally made a Loxodon Smiter much scarier, there were very few times he truly shined. I boarded him out almost every match.

- I feel like the mana in this deck is really good

Now for the event.

**Round 1 - UW Flash (0-2)**

I kept a speculative opener: 5 lands, since by the time I could start casting spells my opponent could counter them all. Unfortunately, none of the cards I drew were uncounterable, had flash, caused their spells to cost 1 more to cast, or did anything relevant. So I lost that one fairly decisively. Game 2 I boarded in both Garruk Relentless and Triumph of Ferocity, as well as the third Faith's Shield. After casting Garruk, but realized I could have saved him with Faith's Shield to make another Wolf token. I got him to 6 before he stabilized with just the single Wolf I had

**Current Record: 0-1**

**Round 2 - UW Humans (0-2)**

He won the die roll

So there I am

**Current Record: 0-2**

**Round 3 - 4-Color Reanimator [Junk splash Red] (2-0)**

This round was actually against someone from my local shop. He had played another local in Round 1 and lost as well. Game 1, ladies and gentlemen, he dropped the final Thragtusk, for a total of 5 consecutive turns of Thragtusk. Luckily, games 2 and 3 went much smoother with the 3 Rest In Peace out of the sideboard. At one point I cast Faith's Shield to save Wolfir Silverheart from a hardcast Angel of Serenity, which allowed me to take over the game.

**Current Record: 1-2**

**Round 4 - UW Flash (2-1)**

This guy got paired down, but removed them for game 3. I figured he had probably boarded out his Runechanter's Pikes and Snapcaster Mages, which means that I could throw in more value cards in their place. How will he know I'm siding them out? If he's siding out like they're already in play, they've done their job without having to be in the mainboard. Since the deck I played is designed with UW Flash in mind, the matchup was very much in my favor most of the way through. I made a misplay at the end of the 3rd game, but it didn't cost me anything because he didn't have the Unsummon.

**Current Record: 2-2**

**Round 5 - UW Flash (2-0)**

This match was against Anthony Hoyhn(sp?). If anybody knows who I'm talking about and can correct me please do so.

I started this match off by asking him if I could call him Tony. I was unaware that apparently he's a fairly prominent player that has attended the Pro Tour

The game went very much my way, but a couple Faith's Shields to blank his Azorius Charms and Unsummons allowed my larger creatures to grind it out in game 1. In game 2 I probably invested too much to the board before the Supreme Verdict, but I drew Nevermore naming Supreme Verdict the next turn. The second one he was holding rotted in his hand all game as he was forced to use his Detention Spheres on my Thalia in order to be able to cast enough spells to not die. He cast a Rhox Faithmender, and also had a Runechanter's Pike, but my early Rest In Peace just meant the small amount of damage he would negate would make the game longer for him than it had to be. He never drew a Sphinx's Revelation.

**Current Record: 3-2**

**Round 6 - Jund Midrange**

I feel like this was one of my poor matchups. It's harder for a creature deck to go bigger than Olivia, and while his Huntmaster flipping back and forth almost killed me, blinking Thragtusk got me there. In game 2, I was unable to stick any reasonable threat, and had to play defense until he just killed me. Game 3, he dropped the hammer on me. He put on enough early pressure that I needed to play my Restoration Angel before my Thragtusk, and then slammed Olivia. First he stole Restoration Angel, he used Rakdos's Return to discard my hand. I cast the Wolfir Avenger but lost my other cards, and swing for lethal with the creatures I got back.

**Current Record: 4-2**

**Round 7 - Junk Midrange**

His deck seemed basically like it was Junk Goodstuff. Deathrite Shaman, Farseek, you name it. Unfortunately, he didn't really give himself any of the ridiculous card advantage engines like Grisly Salvage or Unburial Rites (that I saw), so his draws fell short. In game 1 he was very mana light, losing with only 4 in play, although he had a mana guy and still cast quite a lot of spells. Eventually I took it by swinging with 2 Restoration Angels with him at 5, as he had to mulligan to 4 cards. I took over the game with an Ulvenwald Tracker fairly quickly

**Current Record 5-2**

**Round 8 - BR Zombies**

Without Centaur Healers in the board, and Restoration Angel bonded with a Wolfir Silverheart ends games very quickly. Game 2 he came blazing out the gates, absolutely smashing me. 4 Thragtusks did me no good when I couldn't live long enough to cast them. Game 3 he mulliganed to 5, then got stuck on lands. He had a Mountain and a Rakdos Guildgate in play with 3 Hellriders in hand. If he had drawn into the lands he needed that would've been it for me. It wasn't pretty, but it was a win.

**Current Record: 6-2**

**Round 9 - Naya Midrange**

At this point, found out that if I won my last match I would be able to make Top 32! When rounds were posted, I saw that I was paired up with yet another player from my LGS. I was exactly one point and one tier in the standings ahead of him, so we were both in contention for prizes and the finish. It looked like I was going the full 9 rounds. We shook hands, wished each other good luck, and got to playing.

Game 1 he was able to drop a Huntmaster on turn 3

Game 2 saw me on the play, but ended up risking it anyway and played out the Wolfir Silverheart. He didn't have an answer, and while he was able to drop a Huntmaster to get back up to 14, Restoration Angel paired with the big bad wolf is still a two-turn clock. 1-1

Game 3, it was fairly uneventful. While there was a Bonfire of the Damned for 1 to wipe my mana guys, I used Faith's Shield to save one and still have enough to cast a Restoration Angel the next turn. I kept drawing Wolfir Avengers and Restoration Angels to blink in, and when he finally dropped his Thundermaw Hellkite, I had the Selesnya Charm to stop it before it hit me. With regeneration and 4 toughness making his burn next to useless, my creatures quickly overwhelmed him. 2-1

**Final Record: 7-2**

After everything, and 4 other players from my local shop (of which there were only 8) ended up making prizes. One of them, a 14 year-old who has been playing for less than 6 months, went 7-0-2 in his second major tournament, and ended up in the top 8! While he ended up busting in the quarterfinals, he still earned lots of respect and bragging rights. And $150.",,,,

1376156748.0,1k3jvk,Is The Rock (Junk Midrange) viable in Modern?,Ryuusaki,42,16,17,"Is The Rock (Junk Midrange) viable in Modern? Lets discuss.

My decklist relevant to my discussion of the Junk Midrange Archetype following this link:

[The Rock /Junk Midrange](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/the-rock-17-06-13-1/)

After the banning of Bloodbraid Elf I have found Jund to be much less aggressive in modern regardless of how you switch up the deck and try to fill the void that Bloodbraid has left. I then looked to Ajani Jund that 'splashes' white for Ajani Vengeant, Linvala Keeper of Silence and possibly Stony Silence). The deck shares a lot of card choices with Jund, but plays a bit differently. It trades lightning Bolts for Path to Exile sacrificing aggression for early to late game versatility playing better against Wurmcoil Engine, Goyf, Finks, etc. Lingering Souls is a very synergistic card for the deck and helps cover a weak point against fliers. For the next card choice, there is still a lot of argument about what card deserves the spot (Voice, Scavenging Ooze), the argument for it is the ability to end the game faster as opposed to Vault's purpose of pseudo removal/stabilization). I play 16 Black sources

I will now address what playing GBW means in the current competitive meta. 

Jund - Playing against Jund we are less aggressive

Affinity - Ghost Quarter helps against Inkmoth and Blinkmoth

RDW, etc - Game one can be difficult despite the help from Path, Knight and souls, but the deck can handle extremely aggressive strategies quite well game two and three siding out Bob and Thoughtseize and bring in Scavenging Ooze and other relevant cards, Linvala is not bad as simply a 3/4 Flier when Bob is coming out anyways, etc.

Hatebears - White really gives the deck a fighting chance against a sea of big and or disruptive creatures as path can take care of liege

Merfolk - Path hits lords often when lightning bolt cannot

Tron - Ghost Quarter (Great with sideboarded Life from the Loam), Lingering Souls can buy turns against big stuff, Scavenging Ooze in from the side helps stop Mindslaver lock, Thoughtseize is also effective here and Liliana of the Veil eats up their resources and pushes the game in our favor.

UWx Midrange/Control - Path to Exile/Ghost Quarter for Celestial Collonade, Liliana of the Veil is amazing in this matchup as she is very hard for them to kill, she eats up their resources that allow them to live and removes lone Geist of Saint Traft.

Gifts - They're more effective game 1 than UWx Control, the same kinds of cards are good against Gifts as UWx Control, except Gifts Ungiven gives them an edge unless we hate it out, preferably with a timely thoughtseize.

Soul Sisters/ Martyr Life - Path to Exile helps remove buffed Serra Asendant's and Vault of the Archangel helps race against their life gain while removing their dudes, I haven't played this matchup this much and I think Soul Sister isn't that competitive despite putting up 'some' results.

Faeries - Knight provides a way to stabilize with vault or township and also snowballs into a huge threat they will have serious trouble dealing with. Liliana of the Veil is very nice for applying pressure. Many of our cards are effective here

Birthing Pod - Our removal is good vs both combo pods, our one toughness dudes are vulnerable to Orzhov Pontiff and Izzet Staticaster, Knight is big, ghost quarter for their township, vault to grind them out. Thoughtseize is very nice for removing Pod from their hand among many of their threats and silver bullets. Aven Mindcensor, Linvala Keeper of Silence come in also with Scavenging Ooze and help out, bringing out Lingering Souls and Bob.

Splinter Twin - Instant Removal is huge in this matchup especially being able to kill the Exarch with 4 toughness. Liliana of the Veil is a critical blow to them as you force them to combo into your removal without protection as you eat their resources. Thoughtseize is very nice being able to take away critical combo pieces from their hand. Abrupt Decay is Lethal to their game plan. Linvala can come in to help ensure victory.

Scapeshift - Thoughtseize for Scaleshift is huge. Albeit difficult

Living End - Knight gets big when they blow up our lands and we are not devastated by their land destruction, Life from the Loam can be nice to dredge dudes and keep lands on the table and Scavenging Ooze is very nice for devouring their yard.

Instant Reanimator - Deathrite Shaman is huge if they do not win by the time he is active and he must be removed by them. Thoughtseize is very nice to remove their reanimation spell. Path to Exile can help somewhat against Griselbrand

UR Storm - Storm is weaker now relying a lot on Pyromancer's ascension which we can blow up

I've run into two Maze's End decks in the last couple of days playing Standard 8-mans. The first one was fairly weak

I can't find a Maze's End decklist in the Decks of the Week archive

4 Fog

3 Druid's Deliverance

3 Riot Control

4 Urban Evolution

4 Terminus

2 or 3 Supreme Verdict

1 or 2 Cyclonic Rift

2 Detention Sphere

4 Saruli Gatekeepers

2 or 3 Sphinx's Revelation

1 or 2 Ral Zarek

(at least) 2 Maze's End

After sideboarding, but every turn he just played another Fog. He didn't care how many elemental tokens my Voice of Resurgence made, they would be getting Fogged every turn anyway until a Terminus swept them all under the rug.

The Ral Zarek is a nice touch to untap a Maze's End on the first turn it's in play and activate it for the win.

What are some ways for creature midrange decks to handle this archetype? Is UWR Flash in a better position against this deck? Once Mutavaults come to MTGO Standard

1369727710.0,1f6sks,[Standard] UWR Control or Midrange? or both?,Apertural,32,2,37,"**Introduction**


So I've been pushing UWR as a deck multiple times on this subreddit for the past few weeks and some people have opposing views that UW anything isn't going to be good in this format. I think that assumption is wrong and UWR has had plenty of top spots in Daily's

**The Decks**

[UWR Control-SCG Open](http://sales.starcitygames.com//deckdatabase/displaydeck.php?DeckID=56106)

I really like this deck

[Aetherling UWR](http://www.mtgtop8.com/event?e=5004&amp;d=228864)

it's a simmilar list to previous Aurelia decks but using Aetherling as win con instead. I think Aetherling is a great finisher and so is Aurelia but Aetherling is a lot more difficult to deal with.

[Aurelia UWR](http://www.mtgtop8.com/event?e=4993&amp;d=228798)

With new additions such as Turn

[Reckoner UWR](http://www.mtgtop8.com/event?e=5008&amp;d=228896)

See above. Also the name of this deck is interesting.

[Mixed UWR](http://www.mtgtop8.com/event?e=4961&amp;d=228636)

Decks like this have been popping up on MTGO daily's and Premiers and I like the idea of running Reckoner along side Aurelia. You don't have to use the Combos with reckoner but you can use him as a stone wall against aggro and when the game is in your favor swing in favorably. There have been more list but I can't find the most recent ones on MTGTOP8. [2](http://www.mtgtop8.com/event?e=4932&amp;d=228477)

**Card Choices**

*Creatures*

* Geist of Saint Traft - A power house in Tempo and some UWR midrange decks recently have used him along side Reckoner. I think he isn't very good here but I'd like to be proven wrong

* Thundermaw Hellkite - A strong finisher and can be curved into with a midrange deck that uses Geist.

* Aurelia - An already dominant role player in UWR that can end games when she is put on the battlefield.

* Aetherling - A hard to remove finisher that can kill in two turns if they are at 16 life or below.

* Reckoner - A Big role player in the beginnings of UWR in GTC with combo cards like Harvest Pyre and Blasphemous Act. 

* Snapcaster - Obvious inclusion in any UW deck.

* Restoration Angel - See above.

* Augur of Bolas - Serves as a great 2 drop that can find spells and block aggro fairly well.

* Deputy of acquittals - Recurring Snapcasters/Restoration Angel for Max value and also saves Win cons from Board wipes.

* Izzet Staticaster -  Great against mana dorks

*Burn*

* Warleader's Helix - a 4 Mana Lightning Helix + 1 is seen as slow compared to the original but still is very useful at instant speed. Can bluff Resto with this up as well.

* Turn / Burn - What the Blue Red decks needed to help against Big green Fatties and other problem creatures.

* Searing Spear - 2 Mana Lightning bolt has been a pillar of format and can deal with a lot of creatures

* Pillar of Flame - Voice of Resurgence

*Counters*

* Counterflux - Uncounterable counterspell is really good but overshadowed by Dissipate and it's exile clause
 
* Rendersilent - Counterspell with Silence tacked on can stop a lot of decks.

* Rewind - At 4 mana can counter a spell untap either Resto or Helix with the mana after.

* Dissipate -  Counterspell and Exile the card instead works great against reanimator.

* Negate/Dispel - Work great in the Sideboard

* Syncopate - Good counterspell for X mana and exile clause.

*Card Draw*

* Thought Scour - Filter through deck and making Snapcaster more Potent at 1 mana

* Think Twice - Draw and Flashback Draw

* Azorius Charm - 3 Modes are all good and Cycling it is the most common of the three

* Sphinx's Revelation -  Staple of the Archetype for a reason.

*Others*
 
* Assemble the Leigon - Can get out of hand and just pumps out to many creatures to deal with. 

* Detention Sphere - Can lock away any permanent(s)

* Tamiyo - Great planeswalker that can hurt when opponent is stumbling on mana.

* Ral Zarek - Mana accelerator

* Jace

* Jace Memory Adept - Card Draw and Mill great sideboard

* Renounce the Guilds - Removal that can deal with Multicolored permanents.

* Supreme Verdict - Board wipe that can't be countered 

* Terminus - Board wipe that can be miracled and hard to play around. 

* Clone - Great in the side

**Thoughts**

I think UWR is a fairly powerful archetype to begin with and I think it is hear to stay. There can be improvements to some decks. I will be working with the Control version when I can refine a list and also with the Mixed UWR I think they are all powerful and there won't be one list to rule them all. I want to see a list that is similar to that of UWR control in Modern. I would like to hear your ideas of UWR and maybe help with refining of the decks. If there is anything I missed please let me know thank you for reading.

I wanted to put a heavy emphasis on higher finishers, but I couldn't find those.

Using this value

I thought this gave a pretty good illustration what the biggest decks were

From here, removal, wraths, counter spells, auras and planeswalkers to be prepared for.

I hope this helps out people trying to figure out how to crack this meta at least a little bit. Good luck brewing!

**Edit:** Thanks to /u/jeffhoogland

    =((Points^2/(30)^2)*(OMW%+100-(Best OMW% in top 30))/100)*((30-Finish)/30)^.05

This is a bit of a confusing formula. I think the best way to explain it is to show how changes in each variable effect the resulting score. Here are three graphs to illustrate just this:

[Change in Score with Respect to Points](http://i.imgur.com/DYEVUDk.png)

[Change in Score With Respect to OMW%](http://i.imgur.com/bcvFaP5.png)

[Change in Score With Respect to Place](http://i.imgur.com/UNAsHBf.png)

As you can see, with Placing having very little effect. I discounted placing as it is a redundant statistic outside of the top 8.

I think this card has plenty of room in modern/legacy to be awesome though. In legacy it hoses Brainstorm/any cantrip/Sensei's Top/Sylvan Library/Many other cards. It does cost 4 mana

In modern this card can be crazy with just your own cards. Imagine Clique'ing your opponent with a Notion Thief on the table:

The draft: We had a lot of people, and it wasn't very hard. The rare was gone and the rest of the playables were solid creatures like Drakewing Krasis. Pack 3 was the pivotal pick for me. Several playables, but the Syndic of Tithes stood out. I strongly prefer drafting Orzhov, and if I see that it's open, I will switch into it every time.
After that it was pretty straightforward. I saw that to my right, so by the end of Pack 1 I was confident that I'd be able to continue. The only majorly difficult pick after that was p3p1, between a Knight of Obligation and a Blind Obedience. I ended up picking the Knight because I figured the additional creature would be better.   
We do a rare redraft, everyone was told that someone had opened a foil Boros Reckoner.  
  
Decklist:  
3 Syndic of Tithes  
1 Basilica Guards  
3 Smite  
1 Vizkopa Guildmage  
2 Devour Flesh  
2 Grisly Spectacle  
1 Knight of Obligation  
1 Frontline Medic  
1 Kingpin's Pet  
1 Millennial Gargoyle  
1 Daring Skyjek  
1 Syndicate Enforcer  
1 Assault Griffin  
1 Basilica Screecher  
1 Cartel Aristocrat  
1 Vizkopa Confessor  
1 Court Street Denizen  
9 Plains  
8 Swamp  
  
Relevant Sideboard:  
2 Zarachi Tiger  
1 Millennial Gargoyle  
1 Vizkopa Confessor  
1 Shadow Slice  
1 Death's Approach  
   
I share Ben Stark's view that Orzhov should be as low-curve and aggressive as possible. Usually I actually draft the 18 land Orzhov deck, or something like an Angelic Skirmisher if I get lucky. Here I went 17 lands and topped out with 4 drops. The Court St Denizen slot was variable, and I switched it out often for Zarachi Tigers or Death's Approach.  
  
Round 1: Dimir    

- Game 1 I lost to t1 Cloudfin Raptor, and t4 Deathcult Rogue. Too fast of a start for me to handle.  

- Game 2 I beat him handily

- Game 3 went long, with him attacking with Dinrova Horror and me ignoring combat and just playing out everything I drew with my 4 extorters on board. At one point I attacked with my Knight into a rat token because I forgot it was there, as it was only represented by a die.  Eventually I draw the Grisly Spectacle I need to clear the Ogre Slumlord so I can start attacking for the win.    

(2-1 match
  
Round 2: Gruul    

- Game 1 I remove all of his early creatures, it was Signal the Clans, he searched for 3 bloodrushers and that was game.  

- Game 2: He got stuck on 2 lands until the fifth turn

- Game 3: He kept a hand of 6 lands

(1-2 match
  
Round 3: Dimir  

- Game 1: I played aggressively first game. My grisly spectacle milled his Mind Grind so I was curious just how much milling his deck was capable of. I got him down low enough that I threatened lethal

- Game 2: I sided out Basilica Guards as I didn't see any non-evasive guys

(2-0 match
  
Round 3: Boros  
I was told I was facing the only undefeated guy in the pod
- Game 1: I keep a hand of 2 plains, Grisly Spectacle, Devour Flesh, and another non-land that I forget. I knew it was questionable but decided to risk it. He's on the play and drops Dutiful Thrull. I think that he is playing sub-optimal creatures to hit 3rd turn Battalion off Skynight. I draw an irrelevant card and play plains. Turn 2 he puts Madcap Skills on the Thrull and hits me. Here I get anxious because last time I drafted my only loss was to the Madcap Skills and Spire Tracer deck. I draw a swamp and am relieved. I Devour Flesh his guy when he tries to attack with it again and he thinks for a long time before playing Bomber Corps. I suspect that he kept a land with Thrull and Madcap and not much else action. I think I was correct and I proceeded to win the game pretty handily after that, just by attacking with flyers and extorting. I let all of his attacks through my Guards and Knight as I wasn't willing to get Martial Glory'ed, but I never saw it.   

- Game 2: Here I side in 2 Zarachi Tigers for the Confessor and the Court Street Denizen as I figured the life gain could do some work, but having 2 white creatures, devour flesh, a smite, and something else. I tried to read him to see if he kept the madcap opener again, but I figured this was a safe keep and I didn't think he was going to go for the same trick. I was right and it seemed like he kept a slow hand, with a turn 2 Bomber Corps and no turn 3 play. This gave me time to set up a bit of a board position, and Daring Skyjek and the next turn. Here he thought for a minute before playing Mark for Death
(2-0 in match

We talked a bit after the games and I explained that he basically put me in Orzhov because he passed the Syndic to me (he was 2 to my right). He said he almost first-picked it, so we had to wait around until  the round was over and tiebreakers were calculated before the ranking (and rare redraft pick order) could be determined. I ended up third, and somehow the top rares were just the foil Reckoner, a Sacred Foundry, and Aurelia's Fury. I took the Fury.

Previous self post: http://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/qwg03/steps_to_moving_past_being_a_new_player_into/


**1.) Arrive Early / Register Early** - Seems silly or a given, eat breakfast? I've personally arrived to a few tournaments late, trying to get my deck registered, realizing I'm missing cards and frantically searching for them only to arrive at my first game flustered. You make bad decisions under duress (hehe). **Don't forget your name on your registration / DCI number**. No reason to forget something as critical as this. Also, triple check your decklist. You can never be too safe!

**2.) Eat food. Stay Hydrated** - Bring small snacks that are clean (stay away from chips

**3.) Come with a Sideboard Plan for the Haymakers** - You may not be net decking. You may hate those who do. But they're out there, I like to keep a sheet that explains exactly what my sideboard is so after my match, I double check against it as to make certain if I am deck checked, I won't get a match loss.

**4.) Watch the time before making decisions** - So many match losses come from you not showing up to your table before the round starts. A long round before, whatever the case may be. Unless it's an emergency, if it is coming down to player turns soon, I wouldn't risk it. Not always will the turns be necessary. If it is a bathroom emergency, I would recommend stopping by a judge to just explain it quickly. He may be feeling friendly that day, he may just tell you you're getting a match loss. Either way, the worst case scenario is the same

**5.) When spectating, the most interaction would be ""guys would you please stop the game while I go get a judge?"" If you try and explain to them what's going wrong, or give out information in any way with a comment or otherwise, you could get one person, or both a warning or worse, as well as yourself.  

**6.) With the latest rules changes, non-may triggers. However, if I recall correctly, there's one full turn that it may addressed that will be honored (if it happens on an opponents second main phase, they have until the next to catch it). This may be beneficial to you at times, and it may hurt you on others. Personally, I would like the board state to be represented correctly so I usually inform them of the triggers

**7.) Whenever you don't understand something / seems fishy / all around uncomfortable, or explain gamestate and ask about the question you have.

**8.) Thoroughly Shuffle your opponents deck** - We've seen a lot of things about ""potential"" cheats on /r/magicTCG lately, and it is also a nice to evaluate game state.

**9.) Always pile shuffle your deck** - And not for the ""randomization"" reason. Pile shuffle to count your deck to make certain no card is lost, you should still shuffle as though you have not pile shuffled. I have read somewhere 7 riffle shuffles fully randomize your deck, but I cannot say perfectly from memory right now.... 

**10. Read the Rules for Competitive REL** - Pretty straight forward here. Read the rules to understand how it works for your given format

You can earn byes for these events. To see if you have one/two byes (or how close you are) look up your open points [here](http://www.starcitygames.com/openpoints/).

The format is split between Standard/Legacy. This weekend is standard first

It is OK to share copies of cards between your standard and legacy deck lists.

Top 96 or 15+ points makes the second day of the event. Generally you need the 15+ points. [The last invitational in Atlanta had under 300 people and 104 made day 2 with 15+ points](http://8e8460c4912582c4e519-11fcbfd88ed5b90cfb46edba899033c9.r65.cf1.rackcdn.com/www/scg_events/files/20130406120021000000.html).

This is Brad Nelson's updated Act 2 list that's been making its way around. I ran it at the PTQ in DC last week to some success, more people will be packing hate for it. 

First things first, which becomes a lot harder once you no longer have access to your tokens. Not only that, but I've found my worst match up (so far) is Bant Hexproof. Maybe not the most popular deck, but it certainly pops up here and there and certainly in my local meta (two at my store run it). Hoping for an early Blasphemous Act just doesn't cut it. Also, I believe that new RW blink enchantment will see play (which is dangerous!), and in the mirror, having something against an opposing Assemble the Legion is nice. And, Rest in Peace! Denies the deck its Blood Artist triggers and Doomed Traveler triggers

Secondly, Advent of the Wurm and Blood Baron. I've found playing against Voice of Resurgence to be beneficial, it's a waste of a slot against the deck. Not only can I just ignore it without any penalty in game 1, where it doesn't do anything, in game 2, I can Mark of Mutiny or Conscript it and then sac it to an Aristocrat to get the x/x token, which happened in every game against the deck. It was wonderful. I also enjoyed playing against Advent over Restoration Angel. It was always obvious when he had the Advent in hand, instead of having to think a bit if I knew it was a Restoration Angel instead. The biggest threat was the Blood Baron. It's immune to all the removal in the deck and we can only get around it with our spirit tokens or Aristocrat, it can turn the tide.

At the PTQ

Another card I've been considering is Profit // Loss

Finally, and is only kept in the main board against that deck, Naya Blitz and GR Aggro (and possibly the mirror). Every other deck it's taken out.

I played GR Tron at a PTQ on Saturday. I thought I would give a tournament report. This was my decklist (http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/gr-tron-v2/) and I finished 14th / 142. I went 6-2.

* R1 - Amulet of Vigor (2-0)

Went 2-0 against the Amulet of Vigor / Primeeval Titan combo deck. The key thing here is blowing up their stuff and getting a Wurmcoil into play. Game 1

* R2 - Splinter Twin (2-1)

Against a pretty standard Splinter Twin list. Game 1 he was a bit mana screwed and I was not sure what I was playing

Game three, Nature’s Claim my own expedition map and tutor up a Phyrexia’s Core to sacrifice a spellskite for one life.

* R3 - Splinter Twin (0-2)

I lost badly here. I misplayed game one (I didn’t exile a Zealous Conscripts

* R4 - Affinity (0-2)

Again, and got smashed again.

* R5 - BUG (2-1)

Tron shines against BUG and other mid-range decks. There isn’t much to say here apart from Relics of Progenitus lock down Snapcasters beautifully

* R6 - Hexproof Bogle (2-1)

This is another decent match up for Tron. He smashed me game one, etc. I managed to resolve a Chalice of the Void in game 3 for both 1 and 2 counters respectively, which locked his deck down.

* R7 - RDW (2-1)

This was again a really tight match up. I won game one, how back breaking Chalices of the Void really are against so many decks in the format. 

* R8 - Affinity (2-1)

This was super tense, but game two I just couldn’t deal with him. Game three, I mull’ed to 6 with a hand of Eye, Forest, Chalice, Map, Map, this hand looks dreadful

Reflections on my deck and GR Tron

•	Life totals matter. I find my Tron deck consistently stabilised the board against affinity, Phyrexia’s core did excellent work for me all day. It got me extra life, it protected my wurmcoils from Path to Exiles and brought my Spine of Ish Sah truly online. Of the twenty lands that Tron plays, there is room for two utility lands (except for Tron pieces, Forest, Eye and Groves). I recommend one of those should be Phyrexia’s Core, even if you are not playing the Spine.

•	Wurmcoils are more important than I thought. Resolving one of those is back breaking against most decks

•	Spine of Ish Sah is pretty useful. It can work as a fifth Karn and when you can tutor up a Phyrexia’s Core (and you often will have extra Tutors spare after Tron is online)

•	I mainboarded a Spellskite to deal with infect / bogle / etc. It never became too relevant, but it wasn’t the backbreaking singleton I was hoping.

•	Defense Grid is fantastic against control decks (I was expecting to see a lot of them), Resto Angel, Zealous Conscripts, etc.

•	Slaughter Games did great work for me

•	Chalice of the Void was a sideboard all-star. It basically reads ‘I win’ against a huge number of decks. If you are on the play against affinity, rdw, any aggro deck, eggs – being able to resolve Chalice for 1 is almost an ‘I-win’ button, even if it slows down your eggs, maps and stirrings. This is a definite four-of.

This would probably be my new list; http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/gr-tron-v3/

1359415504.0,17gjmq,[Standard] Esper after Gatecrash,fjdkslan,32,4,43,"Hi guys

So if your local crowd is similar to mine, spot removal, wraths, and Drownyard is likely highly powerful. The question is, what version of Esper is best?

Some are slower, and then Sphinx's Revelation for a bunch to lock up the game, while killing with Drownyard. [Here's a sample list that I'm currently planning on running after Gatecrash hits](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/deck.asp?deck_id=1089499). I should note that I'm planning on adding another black source to better cast Liliana, or removing Liliana altogether, or adding two black sources while going up to 27 lands. I should also note that I'm testing a bit of a transformational sideboard with 4 Resto Angel and the 4th Augur in the board to turn into a Flash variant against the decks where tons of removal and sweepers are bad. So far it's worked out fairly well, since everyone sides out their removal after game one and then has trouble dealing with Angel, but I need more testing to know if it's good or not for sure.

The other option is a more tempo-styled build modeled after UW Flash. These generally run Angel, and often Geist and Obzedat. They look to build tons of incremental advantage through their synergistic creatures and powerful spells, and often tempo out aggressive decks with Geist or Obzedat.

Keep it mind this usually requires multiple pieces though since Moorland Haunt + Runechanter's Pike is essentially infinite power. Curse of Death's Hold goes a long way if you can power it through via Duress or other methods. Staff of Nin also shuts off half the attacking part of the deck. If you want to grind them out

1348025324.0,1049wk,So You Want to Play Magic Competitively? Here's How to Get Started.,k1ngch0wm31n,34,7,5,"So you want to get better at Magic? 

The Beginning


There are quite a few differences between competitive Magic and casual Magic; money, even knowledge. Here’s a basic primer to get you started.


On average, utilize a proxy. Don’t actually commit to buying a card until you’re absolutely sure you’re going to need it. Proxy up entire decklists if you want, but remember, never spend more than you have to.


The easiest way to get the cards you need is start a playtest group. Find a couple of friends who are willing to make the competitive jump with you and work together. You don’t have the duals you need
This accomplishes several things. You don’t have to break the bank buying cards for a multitude of decks


Speaking of time


What card should I play? What land should I drop? Should I swing? All of these are now questions you have to ask yourself on a consistent basis whenever you play. 


Playtesting also allows you to fine-tune your deck. Should I run the 4 Mana Leaks? Tragic Slip or Gut Shot? How many Path to Exiles do I want to run mainboard? How is my aggro/combo/control matchup? Can I consistently beat the mirror?


If you’re unfortunate enough to not have a consistent playgroup, many of the other players at FNM will use homebrews, budget versions, other random jank crap, but it's viable. The important part is that all decks tend to fall under three categories aggro/combo/control.  Understand how you can play against all three archetypes.
Get blown out by homebrew infect? Well


It's not a perfect system, your first thought should never be to blame variance or luck. If it is luck based, it's luck based and you'll never be able to change that fact. Try and find alternate lines of play that would've bought you another turn. See if that extra turn would've given you an out. Maybe you could've killed him a couple turns ago, but failed to attack. Always look back and try and find mistakes in your play.


Finally, sometimes correctly. Essentially, a “metagame” or “metagaming” is utilizing outside knowledge to influence your decisions. In the case of Magic, you know (from tournament results) that Delver is popular so you know that the current “meta” is Delver-centric. This can give you a bonus when playing and constructing. By understanding the “metagame”, you are able to work on more information and understand plays better.
For example (without “metagame”)


Turn 1: Seachrome Coast


What deck is he playing? U/W Control? U/W Midrange? Delver? Miracles? Maybe some jank homebrew using the lands he had available? Without a metagame


(With “metagame)


Turn 1: Seachrome Coast


We can narrow the deck choice down to pretty much just U/W Delver and Miracles. Turn 1 Ponder followed by Shuffle/Draw means that they are displeased with the 3 cards they looked at. If they’re playing Delver


As you can see
However, old ones are utilized in a new fashion. People want to break the mold of the old “metagame” and confuse you. As a result, take the “metagame” with a grain of salt. Understand that a majority of the time, the meta will be stable, but there will be sudden shifts on occasion.


The most important thing to remember is that Magic is a game. Relax. Have fun. Don’t force yourself into playing if you don’t want to. Getting to the Pro Tour is the dream

Hey there /r/spikes I recently took a break from magic but I'm back at it again. I've taken to looking at recent lists and how recent opens/GP's have gone. What I realized is that UWR has evolved in the current meta quite a bit lately and right now there are only really two dominant versions of it, Augur, and Restoration Angel with thundermaw in the side. Both have put up results in the past on MTGO daily's and premier events and even PTQs.

**Here are the lists I found**

[Midrange List](http://www.mtgtop8.com/event?e=5308&amp;d=230609)

[Thundermaw Main](http://www.mtgtop8.com/event?e=5211&amp;d=230042)

What is the purpose of Thundermaw from the side

[Control List](http://www.mtgtop8.com/event?e=5210&amp;d=230036)

Why has this version fallen out of place and why is the midrange version so much more dominant?

**The Meta**

Looking at recent list of daily's, and the occasional bigger events I've noticed that the Control variant of UWR is basically gone what is the reason behind this?

From what I've noticed Grull aggro, UWR, Naya, and Junk Cats are the big decks in the format and this will change once M14 is available, reading up on what is being released Bant Pants seems to be in favor soon to come. Does UWR have a good match up against this deck in it's current form?

Since I haven't played in quite some time I'm seeing new decks that hadn't been there when I left. What makes Junk Cats better than Act 1 or 2? Why is Liliana in the side of Jund and How to deal with Ruric Thar? Is Junk Re-An still top dog in this format?

1372087376.0,1gz0xk,[MODERN] Developing and improving blue tron.,prollyLucario,36,11,21,"Mono-U tron has been a deck for quite some time

Blue based tron has been putting up fantastic results recently, like Platinum Angel and mindslaver.

Here's an example mono blue tron list
http://mtgo-stats.info/archInfo/?aID=506&amp;fName=Modern

You counter and delay threats, assuming they don't have land destruction or spreading seas, will be more than enough to counter every relevant threat -- and can theoretically stabilize against aggro using Wurmcoil, sad robots, and, although this is a bit fringe right now, sideboarded red 
or white sweepers.

Your win condition is usually going to be Mindslaver -- locks are very possible with your 1x Academy Ruins

My problems with the deck --

1: If you lose the coin flip and your (aggro) opponent has a keepable hand

Obviously

I'm uncertain if this is correct. I've won far too many games against robots and affinity with 2-3 life left before recovering to want to take any additional damage from my lands. You can still certainly win with a god hand containing all three urza lands + wurmcoil

Even worse

Personally, unfortunately, but was great practice) has a lot of success with spell snare. It made matchups like affinity and melira-pod MUCH less painful, and gives us an option to do something on turn 1 when on the draw. It also counters a lot of relevant hate, such as stony silence, but I'm going to be honest here---

Opponents playing decks like melira-pod should not be siding that card in against this deck. You need to become aggro and beat down as hard as possible. Spending two mana to shut down expedition map, but the deck has more diverse win conditions, and can just repeal @ EoT anyways. I'd directly attribute at least two wins to 'oversideboarding' on my opponents' part.

Still

In the dozens of jund matchups (including white jund, my most common losses occurred when a turn 2 dark confidant resolved and the opponent was able to directly answer my threats 1 for 1 while gaining card advantage. This is the ideal line for the deck, obviously, but we really should have a way to counter a turn 2 confidant on the draw if we aren't able to remove it.

Spell snare is dead against no matchup, with honorable mentions for 'cheap' going to soul sisters and bant hexproof.

Batterskull is another inclusion to combat aggro/tempo decks, as does the ability to bounce itself in response to a path. You can even toss one on a sad robot or treasure mage!



2: For a control deck


Melira pod isn't a combo deck -- it's an aggro deck that just happens to get infinite life or deal infinite damage a terrifying amount of time. This realization is crucial if you want to realize ""who's the beatdown"" and know your role in the matchup. I'm talking about scapeshift and R/U twin.

Mono-U tron is prevalent enough that people know it runs no true 'hard' counters, but it doesn't really hurt them -- we need to take out combo pieces for good, not delay them, as any infinite combo is going to outrace what we're doing.

Spell snare helps quite a bit with scapeshift matchups, but neither are capable of delaying the decks long enough to get consistent wins.

I honestly don't know how to properly answer these decks, if a bit of a pipe dream, to be able to win game 1 against combo.



3 -- Path to Exile negates all of your win conditions except Mindslaver

Batterskull solves all of this. I realize you can't tutor batterskull with Treasure Mage, Mindslaver, the body left behind has rarely been relevant. I do not think 'tutorable with treasure mage' should remain a criteria for every win condition in this deck, nor should we be exclusively playing 7-drops due to the ideal situation of having all three urza lands on turn 3.

A final possibility and proposed inclusion is Myr Incubator. Extensive testing at 1-2 of shows it's often capable of making ten myr -- even late in the game. Of course, often being able to win the game in a single swing after accounting for fetch/shockland damage. The card was a powerhouse in standard, and it's proving quite potent in Modern too.

Of course, which are more than a little difficult to break open.


That's all the testing I've done for now

The biggest mistake I think I made in Nashville last weekend was not playing more Searing Spear. I think this is an easy 3-4 of in any deck playing red removal right now as their primary source of killing things.

I'm also going back and forth as to whether main decking a couple of pillar of flame is the right call. They are fairly good against aggressive decks and Voice (which all the bant flash/hexproof decks have been playing). Plus in matchups like reanimator it kills dorks on turn 1 and it can at least kill Huntmaster against Jund.

What is your opinion on red removal right now spikes?

My highly anticipated tournament report shamelessly plugged by our own [Jeff Hoogland](http://www.reddit.com/user/jeffhoogland). You can find the 75 I ran at the open [here](http://sales.starcitygames.com//deckdatabase/displaydeck.php?DeckID=55954) with the changes I've made since my last report for my top 16 in Milwaukee. Enough Babbling lets hop in.

**Round 1 - Shardless Bug**

I'll start off by saying this is a very hard match up due to the fact that they just simply draw more cards than me and pull ahead. Game 1 my opponent keeps a hand that got punished by a wasteland which I was lucky enough to have 2 of in my opening hand that where followed up by a Bob and he quickly concedes. Game 2 is a bit more of a grind where I end up getting blown out by Bob flipping a Tombstalker and my opponent casting a whipflare with a board that lived through it. I stumble on lands game 3 and it ends pretty quickly. So I start the open off to a bad start but I don't let it get to me.

My side boarding went as follows:

+1 Notion Thief

+2 Tombstalker

+1 Umezawa's Jitte

+1 Maelstrom Pulse


-2 Daze

-3 Thoughtseize

0-1


**Round 2 - Dredge**

Contrary to popular belief Deathrite Shaman is not very good against Dredge due to the sheer number of things they put in the graveyard that being said I start the game off by mulliganing an unplayable 7 into a 6 with 2 Thoughtseizes and a Liliana. It doesn't take long for my keep to look embarrassing as my opponents first turn is City of Brass into Careful Study discarding some dredgers. Things look bad for our hero and I pack it in pretty quickly. Game 2 I open up on the play with a Thoughtseize and take his only enabler in the form of a Careful Study and add a Goyf and a Deathrite Shaman to the board to clean up after his slow start. Game 3 I board out my Thoughtseizes on the draw and brought in my Phyrexian Revoker just as a body that can potentially shut off LED. I'm pleasantly surprised when I look like I stone cold master and have the Revoker to name Grindstone after he shows me his transformative sideboard I did not get to see game 2. The revoker is able to close the game out with the help of a Jitte and a Jace.

My side boarding went as follows:

+1 Nihil Spellbomb

+2 Surigical Extraction

+1 Umezawa's Jitte

+1 Maelstrom Pulse

+1 Blue Elemental Blast

+3 Engineered Plague


-2 Hymn to Tourach

-2 Liliana of the Veil

-2 Thoughtseize

-1 Sylvan Library

-2 Jace

On game 3 when I was on the draw I took out the 2 remaining Thoughtseizes for the Revoker and a Jace

1-1

**Round 3 - Storm (TES)**

I like my storm match up a lot due to a large amount of main deck disruption I have combined with a fairly quick clock. So I wasn't to unhappy when my opponent starts off with a Gemstone Mine into a ponder. I lead with a shaman and he follows up with a 2nd cavern and a preordain. I wasteland the fresh cavern and watch him miss his next land drop and have to burn the last counter on a brainstorm which misses

My side boarding went as follows:

+1 Nihil Spellbomb

+2 Surigical Extraction

+1 Phyrexian Revoker

+1 Notion Thief

+1 Blue Elemental Blast

+1 Zur's Weirding

+1 Duress

-1 Sylvan Library

-2 Baleful Strix

-4 Abrupt Decay

-2 Jace

2-1

**Round 4 - Sneak and Show**

Much like storm I like this matchup due to my large amount of disruption. My opponent is kind enough to shuffle towards me showing me a show and tell and a sneak attack (be careful when you shuffle kids) so I mulligan accordingly. Naturally this means I go to 5 with my only disruption being a Hymn that gets misdirected and I lose game 1. Game 2 starts with some hand hate and ends with him empty handed facing down a Zur's weirding and a Goyf. Game 3 we have a fairly long game which ends with my Notion thief staring down his Grislebrand after a show and tell followed up with a Liliana.

My side boarding went as follows:

+1 Phyrexian Revoker

+1 Notion Thief

+1 Zur's Weirding

+1 Blue Elemental Blast

+2 Surgical Extraction

+1 Duress

+1 Maelstrom Pulse

-4 Abrupt Decay

-1 Daze

-1 Jace

-1 Sylvan Library

-1 Hymn to Tourach

3-1

**Round 5 - Sneak and Show**

I keep a hand with a Hymn and 2 Thoughtseizes in the dark and my opponent mulls to 5 so it's a fairly easy game 1. Game 2 ends with him staring down lethal on board and an upkeep Dimir Charm to keep him from top decking a sneak attack for the win.

For sideboarding see above.

4-1

**Round 6 - Adam Jensen with Sneak and Show**

I have a bitter sweet feeling sitting down across from Adam as we're friends and I know what he's on with my last 2 rounds proving that isn't good for him. The match plays out like the previous two

I sideboard similarly to the previous two matches except I boared out the 2nd daze over the Hymn because I know Adam plays simian spirit guides. 

5-1

**Round 7 - Camera match with Brian Braun-Duin running Death Blade**

Getting called over to the camera after losing round 1 is a good feeling

My side boarding went as follows:

+1 Nihil Spellbomb

+1 Notion Thief

+2 Engineered Plague

+1 Umexawa's Jitte

+1 Maelstrom Pulse

-2 Daze

-2 Baleful Strix

-2 Thoughtseize

6-1

**Round 8 - Win and in match with Lauren Nolan with Death Blade**

After doing some tie breaker math with Jeff Hoogland I cannot draw in due to being paired down so I have to play. Game 1 Lauren gets a little greedy and runs out two Bob's. I have no answer for either of them so I just start trying to race with a Strix. Lauren gets pretty lucky and flips 3 lands in a row at &lt;5 life and the game slips out from under me when he gets a jace and shaman online. Game 2 I keep a creature heavy hand and lead with a Thoughtseize into a hand with 3 Swords to Plowshares. Lauren draws into a Jace first and locks the game up.


My side boarding went as follows:

+1 Nihil Spellbomb

+1 Notion Thief

+1 Umexawa's Jitte

+1 Maelstrom Pulse

-2 Daze

-2 Thoughtseize

6-2

I felt a little bummed losing my win and in but Laurens a good player and ended up winning the whole thing so I can't feel to bad. All 3 of the legacy players in our car landed in the top 20 so I'd say it was a pretty successful weekend overall. In my last report I got asked to explain some card choices so I'll address those here.

* Dimir charm

I wanted another removal spell in my main deck but I didn't want another dead card against combo. So I tried this little gem out and its been nothing short of stellar for me ever since I sleeved it up a few opens ago. It hits the a lot of relevant creatures in the form of Bob, etc. Also it counters many combo pieces such as Show and Tell, Natural Order, Time Spiral, etc. It is just an extremely versatile card which is what you want in this format. 

* Tombstalker

These bad boys are a nod to the punishing fire decks. If you take a look at my creature suite I have a pretty hard time keeping anything on the board vs a fire deck. They also do some work in the BUG mirror since 8 CMC does a pretty good job of dodging abrupt decay. 

* Zur's Weirding

I originally saw this card in Adrian Sullivan's [deck list](http://sales.starcitygames.com//deckdatabase/displaydeck.php?DeckID=55010) from Milwaukee and thought it was pretty interesting. I ended up having a discussion with Adrian about the card and thought I'd give it a shot. This card is pretty amazing as it allows you to completely stabilize vs a combo deck. After you pick their hand clean slamming this on the table is just game

* No Force of Will

For awhile I was running 2 forces out of the board and was never really impressed with them just running them out of a sense of obligation. In my experience a proactive strategy and making your combo opponent deal with what you're doing first instead of the reverse is the most effective. Also just adding a dash of force of will isn't going to win me a counter war versus a deck designed to that like sneak and show so I just avoid the fight entirely. with 10 of my last 17 rounds of legacy being versus combo since I made the cut and losing one match to sneak and show after some mulls to 4 I'd say it was a good cut.

* Changes going forward

I was pretty happy with how the deck performed as a whole. The only changes I'm making at the time being is my Jitte is coming out in place of a Jace Belern and a Hymn out for an Inquisition in. The Tombstalkers may also prove unnecessary going forward as the number of punishing fire decks is decreasing. I would like to try out a pernicious deed in my sideboard in place of one of them.

-1 Hymn to Tourach

+1 Inquisition of Kozilek

-1 Umezawa's Jitte

+1 Jace Beleren / Jace

Very uneventful match he won the dice roll Game one he took over the board early with an Augur of Bolas into Supreme Verdict Then Thragtusk hit followed by Resto Angel and the game was quickly over. 

I don't remember my sideboard choices for this game but I probably brought in Boros Charm

Game two I had turn one Champion turn two Burning-Tree into Mauler and a turn three Thalia to prevent a turn three verdict for him after his turn two farseek.

Game three he mulled down to four. He never made it past two lands and the match was over.

Record 2-1

**Match four vs Aaron playing RG aggro.**

Game one I lost the dice roll again and he drops a turn one Stromkirk Noble. I play a Sacred Foundry and Champion of the Parish. Turn two he plays a Flinthoof Boar and swings for one. I play a Mayor and pass. He untaps leaves back his boar and swings for two with Noble then cast a Reckoner. I don't really recall the next few turns

Side in 3x Nearheath Pilgrim

Game two we both got in some early attacks but he wasn't able to draw burn for my Nearheath Pilgrims I was swinging every turn with Frontline paired with Nearheath and a Burning-Tree. He thought he had lethal at one point when he top decked a hellrider dropped it turned his creatures sideways and said game. I had to tell him to wait so I could cast my Searing Spear before he could declare attackers. After that my lifegain was too much for him to deal with as he slowly lost life and creatures while I gained life.

Record 3-1

**Match five vs Jimmy playing UWR Flash.**

Game one he managed to land a Reckoner and then a second Reckoner after he burns my first two threats. I managed to take the game when I had double Ghor-Clan pump on my Mayor and Experiment One on turn four to take out his two Reckoners.

Side in x2 Domri

Game two he mulligans to five and I have a champion turn one with double Burning-Tree into Mayor on turn two. The match was quickly over.

Record 4-1

**Match 6 vs Alex playing Jund midrange.**

The first game was very long with him getting two bonfires to wipe the board but not finding any threats to close out the game. I was able to draw into enough threats to pull out a win even after he cast two Thragtusk. Swinging with a Frontline Medic and two other creatures each turn made his Thragtusks into chump blockers.
Side in 2x Domri Rade 2x Ghor-Clan Rampager 2x Boros Charm. Side out 4x Flinthoof Boar 2x Boros Elite.

Game two he had removal for my early creatures

Record 5-1

Match 7 vs Eddie playing Junk Reanimator

Game one I manage to bring him down to seven life before he resolves an Unburial Rites on an Angel of Serenity

Side in 2x Domri Rade

Game two this game was too long for me to completely recall the plays but I did miss several triggers this game I missed a Mayor flip

Game three I manage to get a quick start on him and he never reaches a fourth land to drop the three Thragtusks he was holding in his hand.

Record 6-1

**Match 8 vs Rob playing Wolfrun Bant.**

Game one I was able to take him down to five before he resolved a Verdict and landed a Centaur Healer and Thragtusk he won shortly after landing the Thragtusk.

Side in 2x Domri-Rade

Game two I had a turn one Champion

Game three I had the best hand of the night. Turn one I drop a Champion, and passes turn without getting a land drop. He proceeds to miss land drops for five turns in a row while I rebuild my army and swing in for lethal.

Record 7-1 


**Top 8 sixth seed vs third seed Cameron playing “Sunny Jund”**

My first top 8 opponent was playing a Jund deck splashing white for Restoration Angel since we're in the top 8 and he had a higher seed he went first. The first game was I managed to bring him down to four with a Frontline Medic a Flinthoof Boar and a Boros Elite swinging in every turn. He was at 2 red lands when I dropped a second Frontline Medic to make sure I could swing for lethal if he miracle cast a Bonfire. Sadly he top decked a Stomping Ground went to 2 and overloaded a Missium Mortars. He then dropped a Thragtusk followed by an Olivia which quickly ended the game.

Side in 2x Boros Charm

Game two I kept my initial seven of 2 Searing Spear

Game three I was able to quickly take over the game. I dropped a Thalia on turn three and he dropped a Nighthawk on turn four. I swung with my Thalia on the next turn and he blocked with Nighthawk. I pumped with Ghor-Clan to take it out. He thin drew into only land instead of anything to stabilize and the match was over.

Record 8-1

**Semi-Finals vs second seed Keith playing Jund Midrange.**

Game one was long and drawn out he had a Nighthawk out swinging and gaining life while he was playing Huntmaster

Side in 2x Domri Rade, 4x Flinthoof Boar.

Game two also went very long but I managed to pull out the win with a surprise Ghor-Clan followed by Boros Charm for lethal when he was at 10 life.

Game three he had to mulligan to five and wasn't able to respond to the threats I was playing the game ended fairly quickly and I was on to the finals.

Record 9-1

**Finals vs Chris playing GB Predator Ooze**

Game one we both mulligan to five. He starts first since he's the higher seed

Side in 2x Fiend Hunter, 1x Searing Spear
Game two I keep my seven he goes down to six. he plays a land and passes. I drop a turn one champion. His turn two he plays a land and passes. His turn two he plays another land and passes turn

1364181807.0,1aybt6,[Standard] RUG Control,ZekeD,28,4,35,"Earlier today I arrived at my local shop, and build something I saw as a ""fun to play"" brew that I had been kicking around. With some input from a few people

What followed was a tear through the swiss and elimination rounds, I went up against a nice spread of different decks, Aristocrats, Naya Blitz, Junk Rites, Wolf Run Bant, and Esper (though more of a mid-rangy list

Without further ado

Card Choices:

Nicol Bolas, and the most fun I had with the deck was slamming down a Nicol Bolas.  Ever since I started experimenting with control decks, Bolas was always on my mind.  After a failed bant attempt, I made a 5-color list that topped out with Bolas, and while it was strong, the mana made it inconsistent. I knew that this deck could easily support him for late-game situations, and the addition of black allowed me to also support the next card.

Abrupt Decay - To put it simply, but those where it shined it was great.

Mizzium Mortars - Overloading this card just feels dirty.  Yesterday during the SCG I heard (I believe) Cedric Philips describe it as ""Plague Wind that has a Terror stapled on to it"". And that's absolutely true. If you need it

Prime Speaker Zegana - After experimenting with Prime Speaker Bant, this card started to show just how great it was.  With counterspells not as popular, this is a great body that refills your hand.  And much like any other great card in the current format, it goes great with Thragtusk.

Izzet Staticaster - I can assure you that without Staticaster, as well as help clear the way in the Junk Rites match when my opponent kept a land-light hand with triple Avacyn's Pilgrim.  Clearing away lingering souls tokens, as well as making combat difficult for just about any deck, made this card an all-star, despite it being nothing more than a chump blocker in a few instances.

All in all, and replace the abrupt decays and nicol bolas with more relevant threats (perhaps Yeva, for more flash run, or maindeck counterflux?) but it's performance today leads me to believe I'm on to something.

What do you guys think? Have you had any luck testing out similar RUG control decks? Any cards I happen to be forgetting exist (as this WAS put together using just what I happened to have on hand,False,,t5_2utkz,False,,,t3_1aybt6

1362321064.0,19ks1s,[Modern] Toronto March 2 PTQ report (Top 4) with UG Infect,thedoh,35,10,27,"I was playing UG Infect for the day. I woke up at 07:20

181 players showed up for 8 rounds of swiss. The prize payout is absolutely bonkers. Kudos to 401 Games for that. They paid out to top 24! 24th went home with a half box.

My decklist is as follows:

Main Deck

* 4 Vines of Vastwood
* 3 Apostle's Blessing
* 1 Dispel
* 1 Dismember
* 4 Might of Old Krosa
* 4 Mutagenic Growth
* 4 Rancor
* 4 Groundswell

* 4 Ichorclaw Myr
* 4 Glistener Elf
* 4 Blighted Agent
* 4 Inkmoth Nexus
* 2 Pendelhaven

* 2 Nature's Claim
* 1 Distortion Strike
* 1 Vendilion Clique
* 1 Dismember
* 1 Torpor Orb
* 1 Grafdigger's Cage



**Round 1**

My Round 1 opponent

Game 1

Sometimes Infect nickel-and-dimes the opponent and sometimes they kill them in big chunks. This was the nickel-and-dime approach. He gained a bunch of life off Kitchen Finks and hit me down a bunch but he still fell to the poison.

Game 2

Turn 1 Noble Hierarch into turn 2 infect guy plus Rancor. This is very difficult to beat with all the protection my deck has. It was a quick one and he didn't do much.

1-0

**Round 2**

My opponent here

Game 1

I squeak out game 1 with big chunks of his infect going away and then we're on to game 2.

Game 2

I mulligan to 6. This is the kind of game that can be frustrating. He's at 8 infect with lethal on board for me and he hits his Splinter Twin enchantment without me having an answer.

I had a proactive answer for his Spellskites in the form of an early Pithing Needle but it wasn't enough to save me.

Game 3

He lands turn 2 Spellskite and I don't draw an answer in time so I'm on the nickel-and-dime plan. He beats me down with his army of tempo creatures (which he seemingly has an endless army of on my turn) and while at 4 infect he shows me Kiki-Jiki. I had a Nature's Claim as my next draw step but it didn't matter; Cappy showed me two Dispel in hand. His win was well protected. He would have killed me with his creatures before I managed to kill him with infect at that rate anyways.

1-1

**Round 3**

This is up against a RB Burn deck

Game 1

I win the die roll and mulligan to 6. I have early lethal on board and in hand. My opponent swings in with a Goblin Guide. I flip Might of Old Krosa, counted my hand and objected again, then realized I had played an Inkmoth Nexus and accepted the Game Loss fate and learned to pay attention no matter how dead my opponent is.

Game 2

I 9-spot him early in the game and then he has no answer. Easy win.

Game 3

He keeps a one-lander for some reason on 7 cards and never gets there. I whack him for 7 and then he scoops when he realizes he's dead on board.

I had so much protection this match between Dispel

**Round 4**

I know my opponent personally

Game 1

I am on the play and lead off with a Noble Hierarch

That doesn't happen and instead I smack him for 7

2-1

Game 2

He sideboards a bunch of cards and I bring in my Pithing Needles

He starts. I lead with an early Needle on Spellskite and have Dismember in my opening 6. I feel very good about this game and feel that I have it absolutely locked up.

He paths my guy which ramps me into more mana to use in protecting and buffing my team.

I land a Torpor Orb and endure the beatdown from his creatures until I start taking large chunks out of his infect life. 0 to 3 to 7 to dead.

After the match he tells me that he doesn't play Melira at all. I didn't realize that Resto-Pod had cut Melira entirely from their list! I guess now they are all-in on the Kiki-Jiki plan and don't feel the need to board in Meliras.

3-1

**Round 5**

This round my opponent is on Affinity/Robots. I win the die roll and we crack on.

Game 1

I'm on the play and lead off with a threat. He barfs a bunch of artifacts on the table and I realize he's doing basically the same thing as me but with creature damage.

I get the impression that he isn't very familiar with the Infect archtype since he reads a bunch of cards. This will lead to his downfall.

He quickly starts throwing his creatures in front of my attackers and they all die. He goes to block with an Ornithopter and use a Welding Jar on it and I comment ""that doesn't work the way you think it does."" He calls a judge over to confirm and just throws the `Thopter away

He runs out of effective blockers and I'm able to start connecting for huge chunks of damage: 5 infect and then dead.

Game 2

He starts out on 7 while I head to mulligan town and pick up 6 good ones.

He does something irrelevant and I turn 1 Pithing Needle Cranial Plating which basically guarantees that I'm going to win the quick race. He lands turn 2 Etched Champion and I follow up with Blighted Agent. He has a read

I untap and ten-spot him. He seems very surprised that his Etched Champion can't block and the match is over.

He looked very dejected and the match was over very quickly. I don't think he expected my deck to be able to just untap and kill him even though his deck is aiming to do the same thing. Let it be a lesson: FULLY READ the cards your opponents play if you're not familiar with it.

4-1

**Round 6**

I'm up against a SWEET Boros Landfall deck. I won't say too much since I know the deckbuilder (my opponent) and I think he wants to keep it under wraps.

Game 1

I win the dice roll and start on the play. I score another ten-spot and he's dead.

Game 2

He whoops me good without me landing any infect damage. This very rarely happens.

Game 3

He goes all in on a plan of attack and I have the clutch Dispel and he's now without a board position, marvel at his deck and then hand in my slip.

5-1

**Round 7**

Going into this round I am in 4th place with the best tiebreakers of the 15 pointers. If I win I can very likely draw round 8 and make it into top 8. But first I need to get through a Jund deck.

Game 1:

This game is pretty fucking miserable because of an unpleasant judge call. I have my opponent at 9 infect and dead when I untap and he has me dead on board

He turns his attackers sideways

My opponent did not understand that once we're in Declare Attackers and he is nominating attackers that it is too late to animate the manland and turn it sideways. I won the game but felt super bad about it. Talking with people after the match they bring up that on Modo there's no takebacksies in this regard. We're playing a match to determine who can draw into top 8 and earn a trip to the Pro Tour; these tournaments are designed to reward players with a superior rules knowledge and even though it felt bad in this regard that is what happened.

Game 2 

He gets it done even after I pre-emptively needle Spellskite. Should have been Liliana. He's up to 5 poison but his discard rips my hand apart.

Game 3

I'm on the play and my opponent mulligans quite a bit. He's unable to interact and I kill him. He signs the slip and I GTFO as soon as possible.

6-1

**Round 8**

I'm in 5th place. My buddy hopped me by 1% on breakers and stole 4th. I'm sitting with the 3rd place seed due to 3rd and 4th having played already. We agree to draw and 4th, pickle, and onion with mustard (not toasted, obv) and pick up a bottle of water. I vanquish my opponent while 4th seed was defeated, getting a bag to take leftovers away. We head back and pop some gum to not offend our top 8 opponents.

6-1-1


**Top 8**


I'm playing against Jund again. He's a higher seed and is on the play

Game 1

I steal this game which is absolutely clutch. He kept a hand of discard spells and one swamp(!?!) knowing that I was on infect. He lands a Deathrite and I'm able to get through for enough infect with him shocking me from 20 to 10 with Deathrite.

I see that he's on maindeck Olivia Voldaren and Profane Command! I obviously fold to Olivia but I had 2 Hierarchs and Pendelhaven plus an Inkmoth. He was forced to block with Olivia while at 7 infect to stop the 4/5 Inkmoth and revealed Profane Command the next turn to kill a Hierarch and resurrect Olivia. It didn't matter because he had to throw Olivia away again to stop the 3/4 Inkmoth. A quick Judge call here to verify Exalted and the new trigger rules and he quickly scooped.

Game 2

I mulligan once again down to 6 and get him up to 6 infect. He flips a bolt to Bob

Game 3 

Infect on the play with a full grip is not good.

I alter my opening sequence and lead off with a Glistener Elf instead of Hierarch as I'd done game 1 and 2. I've got a good hand and feel confident that I can kill him quickly.

He goes to 3 infect and then 8 and then I'm in the top 4.

After the match he consults with his friends about his keeps and lines of play. In the end he was unable to disrupt my plan in game 3.

7-1-1

Prior to this weekend

[Mike Mahaffey's Bant Control](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/deck.asp?deck_id=1093834)

And here's Detora's deck if you haven't seen it:

[Melissa Detora's Wolf-Run Bant](http://www.decklists.net/index.php?option=com_ohmydeckdb&amp;controller=deck&amp;view=deck&amp;deckId=16927)

Mahaffey's list was better than Reid Duke's list because of its acceleration, namely Jace, Architect of Thought. Prime Speaker Zegana is powerful, but underwhelming on her own. 

The most important thing Melissa Detora picked up on was the need for Kessig Wolf-Run. I didn't like just sitting there with Drownyard as my Plan B. Kessig Wolf-Run generates insane value on one creature

So, I 4-0-2'd the Swiss and took 5th overall (losing a heartbreaker to Jund Aggro in Game 3 in the quarter-finals). 

For reference

- Naya Humans
- Humanimator
- Jund
- Jund
- Round 5 was an intentional draw
- Round 6 was an intentional draw
- Jund Aggro

1 - Over-confidence in hands during Game 2 coming off a win is a major weakness of mine

Here are some highlights:

- Swinging in with Gisela

- Holding a Kessig Wolf-Run against another Jund player who admitted (for some reason) to not knowing what I was playing. He put me in the red zone thinking I could only punch back for 3 with a Beast token. I dropped the Wolf-Run and charged in for lethal. 

- Letting a Humanimator player pack his graveyard because he knew I was holding a Supreme Verdict

- Beating a Naya Human player 62-0. 

**What I like:**

- A lot of things just feel right about Detora's list. At 25 land

- The sideboard is strong in a lot of match-ups. Humanimator, in particular, was fantastic. Witchbane Orb seems oppressive against Esper, and I think I like it more than Jace, Memory Adept. Gisela, Blade of Goldnight is incredibly spicy. 

**What I don't like:**

- 14 shocklands. I get that you want plenty of targets for Farseek

- 3 Rhox Faithmender. It feels like a bit much. I'm happy to see him

Moving forward

- Huntmaster of the Fells. It feels very powerful in this archetype

- Garruk

- Feeling of Dread. This seems like a really good option for the decks that use Boros Reckoner aggressively (instead of the more combo-oriented UWR builds). Naturally

- Angel of Serenity. I don't think the deck is screaming for this inclusion

1358355023.0,16ox4o,More Sam Black from his SCG Premium article today,hivemind_MVGC,35,10,52,"&gt;I've heard a lot of complaints about this Standard format

&gt;The objection has to be (I assume) in the actual game play or possibly the way decks are built generally. Decks and games rely far more heavily on single cards

&gt;R&amp;D has made a conscious shift toward flashy cards that stand on their own and away from linear strategies, it's more likely that every deck will share a few cards regardless of what their plan is, which is why so many decks have Thragtusk and/or Restoration Angel.

&gt;This is to say that it's extremely unlikely that you'll play against someone who is playing the same deck as you, it was often because the card was just too good and needed to be banned like Skullclamp or Sensei's Divining Top. It's not too surprising that it's unpopular now because complaints have been pretty common in any format where there's some card that's in every deck.

&gt;I think people just don't have the language or structure to identify the fact that several cards are in half the decks to properly form complaints, so it will take a significant amount of time for it to change. While banning has been a possible solution in the past, calling to ban a card merely because every white deck plays it and half the decks have white mana is no longer a reasonable cause for banning because there are ten other cards that would do the exact same thing if it wasn't that card. Magic is just different now.

[Steps to moving past being a ""new player"" into becoming a competitive player](http://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/qwg03/steps_to_moving_past_being_a_new_player_into/)
 
[Competitive Tournament Perparedness](http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/yrsh5/competitive_tournament_preparedness/)

**Pre-Sealed Preparation:**

1.) **Mentally Prepared** - Leave your baggage at home. Go for a walk/ jog in the morning if necessary to help to invigorate yourself and get your mind moving in a positive direction. Make certain you're not arriving late/hungry/hungover/etc. You don't want to deal with things like that throughout the day. Stay hydrated

2.) **Bring Paper to Track Life, like counters, etc.

3.) **Be Fresh to Death** - Everyone hates the negative connotation that surrounds geeks and nerds about being smelly, and your fellow players will appreciate it.

**Registration / Sealed Pool Registration:**

(This area is for if you have to register a pool and turn it in.)

1.) **Write Name / DCI on the Pool you're Registering** - This is the pool that you're registering for someone else. Simple practice

2.) **Count the amount of cards you're registering** - I do a double check: Make certain there's 84 in the pool and there's 6 rares (plus foils). It's the two most noticeable screw ups you can make so I prefer to not make either. Also list the cards from each color in alphabetical order for each color.You do not register the basic lands you open (unless they're foil). If you have a pool that for whatever reason you count isn't 84 cards

3.) **Work in a Clean Space** - This is just to help you keep track of everything. A table riddled with lands, toss it into your pocket or an acceptable place off of the table.

**Deck Construction**

1.) **Write your name on the Deck Registration Sheet** - Pretty straight forward.

2.) **Go through your cards quickly and match them all to the Registration** - This is imperative. If someone lost a card you're only screwing yourself if you don't due diligence.

3.) **Count the Physical Cards, imperative - Only person this hurts is you if you do not do so.

4.) **Once Deck is Built, etc). 

**Enough

1.) **De-Sideboard** - People more easily forget this when it's sealed than when it's standard. A product of Pre-Releases and Releases that are non-competitive (i.e. you don't de-sideboard the strong cards you have identified from playing).

2.) **While on Sideboard

3.) **Be Vigilant on your triggers** - This one screwed me in a match and almost made me lose the round. Make certain you're being mindful of your own must and may triggers now more than ever. No more Lapsing Triggers

4.) **Shuffle Plenty** - No need to screw yourself into that fat stack of lands you had built up last round because you went to time.

**Woo! Top 8!**

1.) **Listen to the Head Judge on How You're to Draft** - It may vary if only slightly from location to location. For instance, and in your hand) as the only 3 piles that may exist.

2.) **Go in with a Rough Strategy and be Willing to toss it out** - There're certain archtypes your comfortable in or are most suited to. While aim for them, maybe you should be trying to get Selesnya. Or you're going for the Rakdos ""balls to the wall"" approach, but you're getting cut out of those strong drops or out of black all together, maybe you should see if another color is open.

3.) **Don't Talk to Anyone Until After the Deck is Registered** - And write your name on the paper :). 


**Final Thoughts**

1.) **This is a Hobby: Enjoy Yourself** - Seems contradictory

So

As a spike, it was clear that the best decks in the format were Jund, Junk Aristocrats, and WB Humans/tokens variants. In addition, I knew that some players would attempt to poke a hole in greedy manabases with Burning Earth mono-red, and some players would rather die than play a deck that isn’t UWx control. After some thinking, I determined the cards that the majority of the decks were soft to: 

* Blood Baron of Vizkopa (Many decks simply cannot beat this card)
* Olivia Voldaren (a true powerhouse against swarms of tokens
* Lifebane Zombie (a 2-for-1 in some matchups
* Pillar of Flame (Voice, High Priest. Kills things dead)
* Bonfire of the Damned (should be self-evident)

That meant constructing a W/B/R midrange list to exploit the power of these cards and win games against unprepared opponents. The game plan of this deck is simple: survive for a while and then keep slamming powerful, Vampire Nighthawk, and a wide variety of 2-mana removal spells. The majority of cards in this list are 2-ofs and 4-ofs. The 2-ofs often serve overlapping functions but are slightly better or worse in various matchups. The 4-ofs are generally fantastic overall. This led me to the following list:

Creatures:

* 2 Gloom Surgeon
* 2 Vampire Nighthawk
* 2 Lifebane Zombie
* 4 Boros Reckoner
* 2 Olivia Voldaren
* 4 Blood Baron of Vizkopa
* 2 Obzedat

Spells:

* 4 Pillar of Flame
* 2 Ultimate Price (need to be able to answer Desecration Demon (thanks Jeff Hoogland))
* 2 Dreadbore
* 3 Warleader's Helix
* 2 Bonfire of the Damned
* 2 Rakdos's's's's Return

Artifacts:

* 2 Rakdos Keyrune

Land:

* 4 of each dual
* 1 Cavern of Souls

Sideboard

* 2 Ratchet Bomb
* 2 Barter in Blood
* 1 Celestial Flare
* 3 Lingering Souls
* 2 Thundermaw Hellkite
* 2 Appetite for Brains
* 3 Sin Collector


After much testing (including against the Junk 'Crats player who won the entire PTQ and the Jund player who got third (go LGS!)), W/B humans/tokens, Domri Naya, and UWR midrange. It had neutral matchups against Mono Red and Mono Green Ooze. It had poor matchups against Esper control and Bant Hexproof. I was okay with this, and allotted heavy sideboard to Bant Hexproof. I hoped to dodge Esper Control. This leads us to the first round.

**Round 1: Esper Control**

So much for dodging Esper. My opponent was on a Planeswalker/Verdict heavy list, I conceded, knowing I needed to win two games. He boarded in his Curse of Death's Hold, which was surprisingly effective at shutting down my threats. Lots of my cards died on the spot, and 3/3 Blood Barons are much worse at clocking than 4/4s. 0-2 Loss. 

0-1

**Round 2: Jund**

I kept a slow hand game 1, and Blood Baron Turn 5, he Rakdoses the rest of my hand, slams a Thragtusk, and wipes the floor with me. Game 2, I did to him what he did to me Game 1. Game 3, I keep a faster hand and go under him with Gloom Surgeon, 2 Helixes

1-1

**Round 3: Bant Hexproof**

Game 1 he suits up a Turn 2 Geist and crushes me. Game 2

Game 3 was definitely the most interesting game of Magic I played the entire day. I had a Reckoner on board, and Voice of Resurgence. I was looking pretty dead. I was holding a Barter in Blood, which was no good due to his Pilgrim. I decided to count the board's creatures (4), count my lands (5), and say ""Nine. Sweet. You're at 15?"" After he confirmed, I attacked immediately. Falling for my Blasphemous Act bluff, he blocked with his suited up Geist, and easily won the game from there. 2-1 win.

2-1

**Round 4: U/W Humans**

It turns out that Nighthawk

3-1

**Round 5: Junk Aristocrats**

Game 1 was close, I made a misplay and lost. Game 3, he got stuck on 2 Sunpetal Groves, and after Pillaring his Voice, I took the game home. 2-1 win.

4-1

**Round 6: Junk Aristocrats**

My opponent was a stronger player than my last opponent, I removed her threats one by one, including the Archangel the moment it came down. Someone watching the game said ""Wow, that's an aggressive Helix."" I asked him to leave. Game 3, I kept, on the draw, 4 land (Shock and 3 check with perfect mana, and 2 Blood Baron). She proceeded to Gavony up some Souls and took the game. 1-2 Loss

4-2

**Round 7: Domri Naya**

Although I was out of Top 8 contention

5-2

**Round 8: Intentional Draw**

The PTQ gave prizing based on points

**Take away**

All in all, this deck was a pile of unbeatable cards. At its worst, it's a Jund deck without Farseek or Wolf Run. In reality, its power depends on how prepared your opponents are for Blood Baron.

1374477194.0,1isrvg,[Standard]Esper Control Post M14,amich45,32,7,35,"**Overview**

I have been playing Esper since RTR Standard and have tried a few different versions. It seems like there are a few variants that are all fine to play most of the time although some trump over others from time to time. 

For example GTC Standard Esper Cleansing performed well at the pro tour. This was because at the time Jund was probably the favorite going into the tournament and this deck was set up to beat Jund. It should also be noted that this was the first event The Aristocrats began to see play. Cats, but it did place in large tourneys here and there. Finally as Junk Aristocrats started up in DGM along with Act II and Rg Aggro Esper decided to start mainboarding 4x Terminus to make the matchable winnable. Again Esper struggled in the format until right before M14 release.

Personally I always enjoyed playing the most controlling version possible. I always adapted my deck to the metagame

**Concepts**

Post M14 why are we playing Esper. To be honest I play it even when the deck is T2 at best, that is one very unfavorable matchup that we can cross off our plate as well.

As I have said before I meant for this deck to play as a pure control list. Generally accepting the fact that winning a match 1-0 is completely fine helps this deck by giving it more answers and never needing to give up precious mana. Think of this deck having 2-3 mainboard win cons and those being Sphinx after stabilizing. Drownyard will eventually just win the game for you

This deck really is built with four decks in mind. Most importantly it wants to beat Jund. Secondly Hexproof must be a good matchup at least post board. And it needs to play well against Rg Aggo and UWR. Some choices on cards will seem bad vs other decks because they were not main considerations in the deck building process.

**Creatures**

2x Snapcaster Mage - 95% of the time this card says 1U - target instant in your library gains flashback. But sometimes it comes in end of turn and with some main phase removal it slows down Domri.

**Removal**

2x Doom Blade - Very good in most game 1's. at two mana allows you to play removal end of turn on turn two against aggressive decks when you would otherwise would have to untap and hold up mana for charm or away.

1x Warped Physique - I wouldn't fault anyone for running multiples, Sire, Olivia, Falkenrath, and Blood Artist with ease, which is nice.

2x Far // Away - Kills all the black creatures. Sometimes it is a board wipe after a turn 4 Huntmaster. Sometimes it hits a mana dork and a geist. However most of the time I'm casting this it is just for the edict

1x Tribute to Hunger - This simply gains us life back sometimes. Definitely not a card I want to rely on early game

4x Azorious Charm - Sometimes this card is a time walk if they swing in for what they think is a free ping with a mana dork. Even just forcing an opponent to draw that reckoner or smitter without haste is great. I've seen so many players play around this card just because of the possible setback if they don't have a land in there hand for the next turn yet. It also works with drownyard once in a while to get rid of otherwise problem creatures like falkenrath.

**Card Advantage**

4x Think Twice - This has almost always been a four of in my deck and it didn't last as a three of very long the one time it was. I liked turn two think over Augur in probably 80% of my games. It gives card advantage as early as turn three and more importantly drawing one on turn five or six can help to refill your hand as you run out of answers. We also are not playing Augur anymore so this is a preferred turn two play.

4x Sphinx's Revelation - We are not one of the Sorin/Obzedat lists that wants to find our wincon and win behind it. We want to play this game forever. Running four over three allows us better chances of having one by turn seven or eight to close out the game and it also allows us to cast it on turn five or six when we need more cards and not feel bad.

**Counters**

4x Syncopate - This is why we are not playing Augur. This is better on the play than the draw because it does hit Farseek that way but with so many good two and three drops in standard (Farseek, Thalia, Strangleroot Geist, Blood Artist, Flinthoof Boar, Geist of Saint Traft, Lingering Souls, and early Huntmaster) it is really nice running four because we will almost always have one early on to keep us alive until we can board wipe and later sphinx. Also running 27 lands means it will always work in our list

2x Dissipate - This is much better late game. Countering a Thragtusk

**Board Wipes**

4x Supreme Verdict - I have always liked this much more than Terminus because it feels much more consistent. In certain matchups if I see it in my opening hand with a little more action I feel very safe. Terminus does not do that for me. Sure Verdict folds to Blood Artist

2x Planar Cleansing - This deck was designed to beat Jund. What card destroys Jund? Planar Cleansing. It also has its merits against other annoying permenants like Witchbane Orb and Pithing Needle. It is really slow for Domri

**Planeswalkers**

1x Jace

**Land**

4x Hollowed Fountain

4x Watery Grave

3x Godless Shrine

4x Glacial Fortress

4x Drowned Catacomb

4x Isolated Chapel

3x Nephalia Drownyard

1x Ghost Quarter

I decided to cut one shock instead of a check land because the two life can be relevant sometimes. It seems more likely to need two life in games I lose than to lose because a couple lands came in tapped before turn four. Three drownyard is plenty

**Sideboard**

1x Jace

1x Curse of Echoes - I love this card although I would not fault anyone for ripping it out. Our list does not run any enchantments main deck. It runs 1 walker and only two ""creatures."" Game two it can catch  people off guard as they board out some of there removal. Even if they do leave in a little removal (one or two O-Rings

1x Planar Cleansing - Vs Jund this card is amazing. Bringing in a third is crippling. 

2x Aetherling - Generally these come in vs control as well to give alternate

2x Doom Blade - Against aggro decks this card can be amazing so bringing two more in always feels good. 

2x Far // Away - This could easily be Devour Flesh. The point is this card adds in two additional edicts for Hexproof. Far // Away is better against more decks and against Hexproof it isn't much worse.

3x Appetite for Brains - This is left over from my DGM sideboard and will probably be trimmed down as the meta establishes itself. Right now it is amazing against Jund

3x Rest In Peace - This is for our Aristocrats matchup. It does work if we see Rites but to be honest I'd rather play Purify the Grave against them. Right now however Rest In Peace shuts off Blood Artist, Doomed Traveler, Geralf's Messenger, Snapcaster Mage, Elixir of Immortality, and Physic Spiral.

**Matchups**

**vs Jund** - We hope to see counter spells for Thratusk but we are okay charming his beast. Syncopating turn two Farseek can be really back breaking. Cleansing deals with all there walkers. Verdict a lot of the time will just be used as a single targeted removal spell

-2 Doom Blade

-3 Verdict

-1 Jace

+1 Cleansing

+2 Far // Away

+3 Appetite

**vs Aristocrats** - We pretty much auto lose game one. If we can keep Blood Artist off the table we may be okay but its doubtful. Bring in all the Rest In Peace and hope you see them. If not

-2 Doom Blade

-2 Snapcaster

-1 Dissipate

+2 Far // Away

+3 Rest In Peace

**vs Hexproof** - Game one can be tough but not unwinnable. Game two and three keep edicts and verdicts and it should be an easy win. Just remember to mulligan if needed and don't forget about mending touch.

-1 Doom Blade

-1 Warped Physique

-1 Jace

+2 Far // Away

+1 Planar Cleansing

**vs Aggro** - Use Syncopate and Doom Blade to keep you alive until you can verdict. Sideboarding can change depending on matchup. If no Domri feel free to take out Cleansings. if Wolf Run leave Ghost Quarter in. Jund Aggro

-2 Dissipate

-1 Ghost Quarter

-1 Jace

+2 Doom Blade

+2 Far // Away

**Dega Midrange** - Really good matchup for us. Sin Collector and Slaughter Games can be a true pain post board but with some many different answers and so many dead cards for them we should be good. Let the reckoners hit you in the early game or charm them to slow them down. Don't let Obzedat stick.

-2 Doom Blade

+2 Far // Away

**vs Control** - UWR you need to be careful about tapping out for Sphinx and being burnt. Bant you cannot underestimate how fast there deck can actually be post board. Play around with the board depending on the deck. Appetite can be good vs most some Bant lists. Doom Blade can be excellent vs Thundermaw lists. And Cleansing/Verdict should depend on the list (Smitter Heavy

+2 Atherling

+1 Jace

How about the Edel Naya deck that you only played with 3-5 times proxy before in your life with cards you've never even played with before like Tmaw and Resto Angel and only 2 Voices and put together on the day of said PTQ? Sounds good right? I had played a similar style deck as a homebrew a month back in a Tarmogyf tournament back home and got 2nd because I cant see a Gavony Township in front of my face + leathal on board

Round 1: 4 Color Reanimator guy from yesterday
1-0

R2: UWR g1 mull to 4. He kills my domri so I scoop. g2 t2 domri on the play is brutal followed by resto into Tmaw is too much to handle. g3 I get into a situation where mains Revelation to try to kill my E1 with a Pillar or he dies but Resto blinking my Tusk to make it 4/4 is too much.
2-0

R3: Play against the guy who got 2nd in the Platinum event yesterday with 4 color reanimator. Very similar to my other match

3-0 

Round 4: Arron Barich Naya Aggro on the play go t2 Smiter into Resto into Tmaw into Tmaw. g2 On the draw face 3 Militant draw but have a t1 pilgrim to help. t2 Reckoner Helps me live long enough to beat his face in with a Resto and a Tmaw even when he has Advent into Boros Charm.

4-0

R5: I finally play against the boogyman of the format after avoiding it all weekend, I end up with a Smiter + Resto Angel out, flip a Conscripts off my Domri and use it to put him at 3 AKA dead to Tmaw but he decides he's far too cool to show up even after going through 3 Domri's so I lose. 

4-1

Round 6: Junk Reanimator  I win the die roll so I play land go t2 land go then when he attacks with his t1 dork I eat it with a Knight. I go t3 smiter t4 Angel t5 Hellkite and he dies. Yay quality curve outs! g2 I go t2 Smiter t3 Smiter only to get blown out by Sever again... -_- (That is the last time that weekend it happened). After that it's Slime time and I only have 3 lands so after he blinks it with Angel I scoop. g3 he has a t4 AoS but I went t2 Smiter into t4-3 Resto dont remember but I blinked my Smiter to save it from the angel Then stole his AoS with Conscripts off the top to kill him.

5-1

Round 7: Aristocrats! I dont how this matchup usually pans out but living long enough to go Resto Resto Tmaw Tmaw is good enough to win g1. G2 die to Aristocrat backed up by infinite doomed travelers and lingering souls

6-1

Round 8: UWR Control. This guy has beaten my friend John (who I mentioned in my Platinum report) and Jack who also came down so I have to win this. T2 domri on the play ranches him and restos allow me to apply pressure while stressing his mana in all directions

7-1

Round 9: Bant Hexproof. I am 6th in standings. This time I actually have the option to draw in without getting kicked to 9th place :P. After discussion with the rest of my team who are all out of contention for top 8 I decide to play because I feel it was the best way to win the whole thing (It would have given me 1st seed because the top 4 drew). I will discuss my thought process after. Thank the Lord I won the die roll because even though I sat next to this guy earlier I got tunnel vision during my match and didnt know he was on Hexproof. Very tight g1

7-2

At the end of the day I got 10th, threw it together the morning of, and was missing 2 Voices + 2 Acts SB. 

Now about the play/draw issue in the last round. I chose to play because I knew there were at least 2 Junk Reanimator and 1 Bant Hexproof in the top 8

I got 12 Packs and opened some good stuff including a Stomping Ground, then I would have loved to make jokes about being top 9 king.

Thanks to the SGW crew who came down and lent my poor ass cards so I could compete in these events and for supporting my decision to play. I had a great time and can't wait to go to States or more PTQs in the fall after making some $$$ from my summer camp job.

**Card discussion:**

DRS: This guy is good against so many decks. Only problem is I wish he could reliably ramp (I tried out using forbidden alchemy to get lands in the GY but this is janky). Could see dropping him to 2 MB in my heavy agro meta. 

Vampire Nighthawk: Good all around 3 drop

Thragtusk: Best 5 drop creature in standard

Evil Twin: Awesome with Thrag or Aetherling

Aetherling: This guy is a HOUSE. Could see running 3, planeswalkers and finishing the game. Awesome with Garruk's -3.

Gaze of Granite: Awesome boardwipe

Plasm Capture: This thing is awesome

Far // Away: Utility. I'm liking this card a lot so far. Bant aura is going to see more play since armadillo cloak is back

Putrefy: Great all around removal.

**Cards considered/tested:**

Garruk Relentless: He is pretty good against a lot of decks

Dimir Charm: This card has so much utility

Griselbrand: Really good with plasm capture

Think Twice: If this deck needs one thing it's a draw outlet. This card does help smooth certain draws out

Forbidden Alchemy: Decent synergy with DRS. I often found myself using the mana from plasm capture to flash it back

Progenitor Mimic: This card wrecks certain decks

**Cards I'd like to try:**

Increasing ambition: I think this would be really good with plasm capture

Deadbridge chant: Probably needs a deck built around it

Snapcaster Mage: I don't think I run enough instant/sorcery

4x Skylasher: i think i'm in love with this card. a lot of times he'll just end up trading with a little dude so he ends up just being another removal spell

3x Varolz, but this guy is awesome.

2x Putrefy

3x Syncopate

I'm digging this build because of the hard removal. the aggro matchup is very favorable post board with 4 abrupt decay although some form of life gain would be nice. i've given some thought to thragtusk but it hasnt quite made the list yet.

Whew there are a lot of things in standard right now! Now

* Garruk
* Rapid Hybridization
* Magma Quake
* Wolfir Silverheart
* Rolling Temblor

Have any questions feel free to ask. Also remember that the above should *not* be taken as ""hard and fast"" rules for side boarding. Almost every deck you play against could include slight variations from a ""stock"" list that could require slightly different boarding for optimal play. This is the reason why I *never* write out advanced side boarding guides and always ""fly by the seat of my pants"" when playing an event. The more you play test boarded games

1360010670.0,17vxoq,[Limited] Gatecrash Draft 5-color archetype Primer,FlamingTelepath,30,7,31,"So i've been working on perfecting drafting 5-color in Gatecrash.  It seems to be one of the better archetypes

So far I have drafted this archetype 3 times - and each time I easily 3-0'd the draft.  One of these drafts was FNM

***The advantages of this archetype***

* Will always be the best deck at the table if you get your mana working

* Always have answers to bombs

* Get to play any sweet rares opened in packs 2 and 3

* Significantly less reliant on signals

* Extremely high win % against drafters with weaker decks (due to being cut, etc.)

* This *is* /r/spikes


***Disadvantages***

* Easy to lose to your manabase if you draft poorly

* Very weak to Naturalize in games 2 and 3

* Can fold to extremely aggressive Boros draws


Pick Order:

**1. Bombs**

Having a card that steals games from being way behind is really nice.  You don't really need any absolute bombs in your deck

**2. Top-tier removal**

My pick order for removal goes something like this:

* [Merciless Eviction](http://magiccards.info/gtc/en/177.html)
* [Grisly Spectacle](http://magiccards.info/gtc/en/66.html)
* [One Thousand Lashes](http://magiccards.info/gtc/en/183.html)
* [Orzhov Charm](http://magiccards.info/gtc/en/185.html)
* [Killing Glare](http://magiccards.info/gtc/en/70.html)
* [Arrows of Justice](http://magiccards.info/gtc/en/211.html)
* [Homing Lightning](http://magiccards.info/gtc/en/96.html)
* [Mugging](http://magiccards.info/gtc/en/102.html)
* [Ground Assault](http://magiccards.info/gtc/en/168.html)
* [Executioner's Swing](http://magiccards.info/gtc/en/161.html)

I expect to get at least 5-6 top-tier removal spells.  This is the most important part of the deck

A few notes on the order:

* Merciless Eviction isn't a bomb in this deck always

* Executioner's Swing is much better in this deck than others, and can kill evasive creatures.

* Ground Assault doesn't really kill anything before turn 3

**3. [Prophetic Prism](http://magiccards.info/gtc/en/234.html) and [Urban Evolution](http://magiccards.info/gtc/en/204.html)**

**4. [Verdant Haven](http://magiccards.info/gtc/en/138.html)**

**5. All of the Guildgates and Keyrunes**

I think Urban Evolution should be self-explanatory - the card is insane.

I like taking both Verdant Haven and Prophetic Prism over Guildgates.  These cards are the engine in this deck

I also like taking Guildgates over Keyrunes.  Keyrunes tend to be a bit slow in this format, blocks well, and gains life.  I don't really like playing more than 4 keyrunes in any deck, so I wouldn't pick too many.

**5. Lower tier removal and top-tier creatures**

Basically

Some examples of cards that fall into this category: (in no particular order

* [Smite](http://magiccards.info/gtc/en/25.html)
* [Cinder Elemental](http://magiccards.info/gtc/en/87.html)
* [Debtor's Pulpit](http://magiccards.info/gtc/en/10.html)
* [Angelic Edict](http://magiccards.info/gtc/en/2.html)
* [Death's Approach](http://magiccards.info/gtc/en/62.html)

* [Bane Alley Broker](http://magiccards.info/gtc/en/145.html)
* [Guardian of the Gateless](http://magiccards.info/gtc/en/14.html)
* [Ghor-Clan Rampager](http://magiccards.info/gtc/en/167.html)
* [Nimbus Swimmer](http://magiccards.info/gtc/en/181.html)
* [Dinrova Horror](http://magiccards.info/gtc/en/155.html)

**6. Defensive creatures and big stuff to end the game**

Four toughness is the number we look for here.  This is when I start taking cards like [Elusive Krassis](http://magiccards.info/gtc/en/160.html), and [Corpse Blockade](http://magiccards.info/gtc/en/60.html).

I also really like picking up one or two copies of [Zhur-Taa Swine](http://magiccards.info/gtc/en/210.html) and [Ruination Wurm](http://magiccards.info/gtc/en/192.html) to make sure we have a way of closing out games.


**Notable cards that we value much lower than normal**

* Pit Fight

This is a great card, we have usually already won.

* Smite

We often don't have a creature in play until turn 4, which are the top priority.  I will usually take this card pretty early, but it is definitely not a first pickable card in this archetype.

* Guildmages

It is really hard to get these going

**Open Questions**

* I really don't know how to value the worse removal spells against the really good defensive creatures.  For example

* Which color guildgates and keyrunes to pick up first.  Orzhov tends to always be the best

Round 1:G/B Zombies - This was a deck I haven't played against before. He ran Gravecrawler , and Lotleth Troll . Very fast but Wurmcoil Engine let me stabilize in game 1. (SB in Oblivion Stone ) Game 2 I had a lot harder of a time with all he hand disruption that got sided in. Game 3 I mull'ed to 5 and it was not meant to be. This deck mulligans horribly. (1-2) (0-1)

Round 2: B/W Tokens - One of the best possible match ups. I got Sundering Titan out turn 4 after an early Pyroclasm to blow up his lands

Round 3: Storm - Terrible match, since he took out Grape Shot. (2-0) (2-1)

Round 4: Storm - An even worse match than before because he ran Pyromancer's Ascension. He detroyed me by turn 4. (SB in 4 Nature's Claim , an I was turn 0. I played a 2nd Coil on 0. He passed his turn 1. I swung with both Coils and put him down to 8 goblins. I Eye of Ugin 'ed Emrakul on his turn 3. Turn 4 I swung with the Coils to put him down to 6 goblins, 4 lands, and 16 life. I cast Emrakul and stole his turn 5. I began combat and he sac'ed all but 2 goblins. after Annihilator resolved before blockers I Faith's Shield 'ed a Coil to get lethal in. (2-1) (3-1)

Round 5: 4c Pod - So many people were playing this so I was due to hit it and I was not excited. I got combo'ed out game 1. (SB in 2 Combust , 2 Torpor Orb ) Turn 3 Karn after some ramp and won it handily. Game 3 He was able to Sowing Salt my Mine and I didn't have my Faith's Shield to protect it. I luckily drew into all my Coils and a Stone. He admittedly got mana screwed and I was able to eek it out. (2-1) (4-1)

Round 6: Jund - I love this match up. I absolutely crushed him after I Pyroclasm 'ed and landed Coils. (SB in 2 Faith's Shield , and I resolved a Sundering Titan which I loved as a last minute addition, blowing up 4 lands. I resolved an Emrakul and it was GG. (2-0) (5-1)

Round 7: Splinter Twin - Another terrible match. He kept a one land hand with some dig and didn't find any, 2 Slaughter Games , 4 Nature's Claim ) Game 2 I restarted the game late with Karn because he had 10 mana available and could win at any time. I ended up losing as he top-decked Twin and slammed it. Game 3 I got turn 3 Karn again (been happening like crazy). I controlled board state with Torpor Orb and Emrakul took me to the Top 8. (2-1) (6-1)

Top8: RG Tron, Reanimate, Slippery BogleTop 8:3rd(me) vs 6th: 4c Pod - I wish there was something I could say aside from Harmonic Sliver . He resolved turn 2 on a map, then Phantasmal Image 'ed it to blow up a Star and Sphere. (SB in 2 Combust , 2 Torpor Orb , Oblivion Stone ) Game 2 Deceiver Exarch on my Upkeep to slow me down followed by Thalia. I hit no Torpor Orb's or Pyroclasm and got my face smashed. (0-2)

6-1 (3rd/118): Deck drew extremely well aside from 2 games. I think I need more Torpor Orb s since it loses so hard to Pod. Great experience for a first time serious Modern event.",,t5_2utkz,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1694sx/rg_tron_isnt_gone_i_piloted_it_so_top_8_at_my/

That

So we start with a blank slate: where do I start?

Well

- Paper or Digital

Becoming a better tournament player means you're required to have access to a large card pool (or at least enough money/value to obtain the things you need). As you network and make connections with people, and also the most important; it doesn't matter how good a player you are if your decks are just that much worse.

Now, then Magic Online is almost always going to be the best bet. You won't have to spend tons of time trying to track down cards; they're all located in the Classifieds. Lots of cards are much cheaper on MTGO; Mythics are about the only exception. Sometimes something like Blade Splicer, which became popular in multiple decks simultaneously almost overnight, will rise in price dramatically. Overall, though, MTGO is fairly cost-efficient, especially with Daily Events (but we'll discuss that later).

If you have lots of free time and your local shop offers decent prize support, in an ideal world! Strive for it.

- Learn the Rules

This game has lots of complicated interactions

The [comprehensive rules](http://www.wizards.com/magic/comprules/MagicCompRules_20120201.pdf) are a great resource to have. If you ever have a question about a specific interaction, that's what he's there for.

The best thing to do, and finding out about an obscure interaction in a playtest session is far preferred to discovering it in the middle of a tournament, where it really counts.

- Practice

There's no substitute for practice. Studying is important

Seriously

Every time you play

- Know your Format

The smaller the format, they steadily get bigger. Block Constructed deals with the sets in the most recent Expert expansion; Standard uses cards from the two most recent Expert expansions and the most recent Core set. That means that Limited, Block, and Standard are all formats that constantly rotate. Because of this, prices can fluctuate rapidly due to changes in demand more often than the eternal formats. In paper Magic, Standard and Draft are the most popular, while Sealed is slightly less so and Block Constructed hardly sees play at all. On MTGO, but not even Wizards likes Extended.

Vintage, and Modern are eternal formats. They differ from the other formats in that they have established ban lists, but no cards rotate out. So as every new set is printed, those cards become available to play with. In paper Magic, Legacy and Modern are the most popular, with Pauper rarely seen and and sanctioned Vintage events being some kind of strange ghost that you only hear about in stories. On MTGO, Pauper is the most popular, with Legacy events firing irregularly and Vintage not even existing due to the lack of Power 9 cards.

The most important part of this point, or get him out of a specific situation, or put you in a bad spot if you play one way and not another. Now, this doesn't require that you learn EVERY card in a format; for Legacy, this would be almost impossible. However, you should keep your eyes out for commonly played cards and which decks they appear in. 

You should know, there's a possibility they could have Daze or Force of Will in their hand to counter your first spell, even if they don't have any mana available. You should know that if your opponent played a Blade Splicer on turn 3 and passed the turn without doing anything on turn 4, it's likely they have a Restoration Angel in their hand.

I decided to bring a deck that proactively dealt with a meta that was full of UWr and jund.

In that way it plays much like Jund except with a favorable UWr matchup game 1.

Tournament Report:
 
 
Round 1: Mono Green Aggro

After winning the dice roll I kept a hand with LBZ, and good land.  His elf eats a doom blade and he follows up with stangleroot geist. He eventually suits up a predator ooze  becuase I spent too much time worrying about the strangleroot geist and even 2 thragtusks can't save me. I even LBZ'd away a kalonian hydra at one point, I just don't have access to exile effects so my outs were limited.  Game 2 I sideboard in edicts, appetite for brains  (my Lifebane Zombie revelaed a Garruk caller of beasts game one), and removal. I sideboarded out the sin collectors, desecration demon, and disciple of bolas.  I keep a hand full of answers and spend the first 6 turns either killing or making him sacrifice his board.  Eventually he plays Big Garruk and I answer with an Oblivion Ring.  At this point I still hadn't seen a creature but the next turn I lay down a thragtusk. He was out of steam and eventually died to the lone tusk I played.  Unfortunately this game took us to 8 minutes left in the round and we agree to speed this game up.  I kept a hand with Ooze, Abrupt Decay and no white land.  He kept a 2 land on the play but still curved out to play a ton of elves.  I zap away a craterhoof the turn before he plays it with LBZ.  At some point I drew a mutilate and killed his 5 or 6 elves and my LBZ after it had gotten in for 3 damage.  I had 3 green sources at this point and played my ooze.  I got in for 5 and passed the turn right as time expired.  he didn't have a follow up but the graveyard didn't have the fuel for my ooze to get there.  At this point I asked my opponent to concede because the board state was vastly in my favor.  He agreed and it pretty much made my day.
 
 

1-0
 
 

Round 2: GB Rock

This was her 2nd time playing the deck and she played very tight magic considering that.  Game 1 was a grind fest and involved my LBZing away a tusk and her making me sac the zombie with Liliana.  I abupt decay the Lili and we don't do much else for a while.  Eventually we start trading tusks and I topdeck 2 in a row with a resto angel and grind out the win.  We brought in all out hand disruption and the match was decided by who saw the right disruption first.  I kept a hand with duress and appetite.  She leads with an appetite for brains but I only have the disruption and lifebane zombie.  I played a duress and she revealed another appetite for brains and a Liliana

2-0

 
 
Round 3: Big Red

I've never actually played against this deck and underestimated how resilient chandras phoenix can be.  I'm on the play and LBZ away a boros reckoner, searing spear and bonfire to buyback the phoenix stall the game out until he played a burning earth.  I play a thragtusk and gain 1, but it wasn't enough to stop the hellrider and thundermaw barrage that ensued.  Game 3 was the best game of magic I have played to date.  I kept a hand with sign in blood, 2 basic swamps, doom blades,  ultimate price, and LBZ.  I draw the much needed lands with sign in blood and traded his early reckoner and phoenix with removal, but he had a second one to follow up with.  I play Obzedat to gain life and he crashes in with a hellrider and mutavault.  Decide to take it as I have restoration angel in hand and I can't lose the obzedat to shock or it's game over.  After combat my life total is at 4 and he was still at 20.  I hit him for 5 with obzedat and blink the ghost with my opponent tapped out. The board state stalls for him and I get in with resto and the obzedat triggers taking him to 3.  The way the game ended with me removing the hellrider and the mutavault creature with one card left in his hand. Because of the burning earth the removal took me down to 2 life

3-0

Round 4: UWr Flash

Game 1 I kept a great hand against creature decks.  2 removal spells. LBZ, you win some you lose some.  Great games too.

3-1

 
Round 5: Jund

My opponent seemed pretty tilted from what I'm assuming was a bad loss recently in the tournament and I feel like he bought himself some bad luck.  There's no way to quantify that of course, seem to find ways to lose.  Game 1 I win the dice roll and take a huntmaster before he farseeks into it.  He never found the 5th land for a thragtusk and I flickered the zombie to take it anyway.  He eventually clears the board with bonfire but I won the thragtusk war with some help from scavenging ooze and won from there.  Game 2 I boarded poorly and had to discard off of a sign in blood on turn 2.  It didn't matter bacuase he farseeked into olivia and I had no answers.  game 3 he kept a hand with 2 kessig wolf runs and an overgrown Tomb with a farseek.  He never found Triple green for a garruk and I ripped his hand apart with sin collector, appetite for brains out of the board,  and LBZ. The discard in this deck is nuts.

4-1


Round 6: Act II Aristocrats

I don't remember the specifics of the match as these games involve alot of what I call ""microtransactions"".  Meaning they ping you with blood artist and and hit you with souls tokens but nothing devastating happens outside of reckoner into blasphemous acts.  I remember scavenging ooze hitting his souls every time he played them and me removing his reckoners and Oringing his blood artists to not lose to blasphemous acts.  The games were good but I just had all the right answers. 2-0

5-1

Round 7:  UWr Flash

I've played this guy before and know that he is sorest of losers.  This guy makes magic look so bad.  He's not a neckbeard a social misfit

6-1


Round 8:  RWB Humancrats

The old win and in.  At this point I am in fifth and could tie in, Thragtusk, and Resto Angel.  In hindsight this is a good hand on the play, but one of the worst on the draw.  I see him pay 2 for a sacred foundry and shit myself as he plays a turn one Champion of the Parish.  I play a tapped overgrown tomb and I see him smile.  We both know I'm fucked.  His turn 2 play is gather the townsfolk and he starts the beats. 17-20.   play a tapped Godless Shrine and cry a little.  His turn 3 play was a doomed traveler and a blood artist.  Dat curve 11-20.  After my LBZ revealing a falkenrath aristcrat I see my PTQ flash before my eyes.  He finishes me with sorin emblems and aristocrat.  Thragtusk Resto be damned.  At least my sideboard was somewhat relevant with the sac effects and mutilate.  I really with I had curse of deaths hold in the board and but for whatever reason I though aristocrats was dead.  Game 2 I keep Doom Blade, devour flesh, desecration demon, mutilate, LBZ, but at the same time I'm super stoked at 10th place.

6-2
 
 
Overall it was huge success and after I got over my loss and collected my prize I was very satisfied with the whole thing.  I brought a rogue deck and performed well with it. Can't ask for much more.  I don't plan on continuing this archetype as I don't think it will be as good in a meta full of G/R aggro

Let's talk about the aggro decks. Naya decks don't really care about burning earth because they're casting t2 smiter/reckoner, and wear//tear comes out of the board (if it's even there, I don't play UWR). Hexproof kills you the turn after you cast burning earth, and it does nothing for you. 

I'm just not seeing why people have hyped it up so much. Did I miss something?",,t5_2utkz,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1jeqqc/standard_card_discussion_burning_earth/
1374811121.0,1j2rm6,[STANDARD] Why UWR flash is the only blue deck you should be playing,Phrost_,34,10,21,"So I’ve been playing a version of UWR very close to Matt Costa’s that he piloted to a GP top 8 at GP Miami.  You can view the list here: http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/uwr-flash-21-07-13-1/
Why should you play UWR flash over other UW control variants?  There are a lot of reasons:

1)	Supreme Verdict sucks.  A lot of decks get BETTER board positions after you cast it.  It’s pretty abysmal.

2)	Terminus can be great when you miracle it and pretty awful when you don’t.

3)	Planeswalkers (which are usually very strong versus dedicated UW control variants) are very easy to deal with and you don’t have to play temporary solutions (oblivion ring

4)	You can close out a game much quicker than aetherling or drownyard decks.

One of the biggest reasons I have trouble picking up blue decks is because you can frequently have trouble closing out games that stretch on for seemingly days.  I never want to go to time in a round and have my match decided by 5 extra turns if I can help it.  U/W/R has the ability to quickly switch gears from survival control mode to beat down.  With the addition of Mutavault

Card choices:

Mutavault : I like these a lot.  They do everything that you want to be doing

Thundermaw Hellkite: I don’t play Aetherling, and for less mana.  Thundermaw is also a lot better at closing out games if you draw multiple (there are several games I’ve played that ended with turn 5 thundermaw, turn 6 thundermaw).  Aetherling is very hard to kill but is also VERY slow.  Ideally you should be able to protect your threats with counter spells and the durability factor of aetherling should not matter.  The mana/damage ration of thundermaw is also much higher as this deck wants to play a win condition and then protect it until it wins.

Counterflux:  With the waning popularity of Junk Reanimator

61st card: There is a flex slot here too


Sideboard:

I’ve made a few changes post-m14.  I am playing 2 wear//tear to respect burning earth.  They were keening apparitions but I found that frequently playing the 2/2 just wasn’t ever as good as flashback on wear//tear.  These also come in against bant hexproof and can sometimes give us just enough of a chance to race.
Supreme Verdict: Yeah I said it sucks but it’s really good at stabilizing against 2 matchups.  Bant hexproof and any kind of naya or mono-red esque deck.  Basically any deck that isn’t full of undying creatures


Ratchet Bomb: I bring this in against bant hexproof once again to hope to get their similarly costed permanents.  This matchup is usually a crap shoot so I don’t devote too many sideboard slots to a deck that you beat more often than not when it beats itself.


Thundermaw:  He comes in against every non-aggressive matchup but he stays in the board because of how bad Thundermaw is in matchups where it’s bad.  If you ever look at your opening hand against monored with a thundermaw in it


Izzet Staticaster // Renounce the Guilds:  Unfortunately both of these come in together against a lot of the same decks even though it’s a non-bo.  The staticaster shores up UWR’s general softness to token and Falkenrath Aristocrat.


Matchups:


UWX control: 

After board I feel favored in everything but the mirror match (because that should theoretically be 50/50 on paper) due to increased threat density and favoring cheaper dispels over negates to protect my threats.  Esper control decks with lots of spot removal can be a pain but if they’re relying on sweepers it’s very easy to sneak in enough damage with mutavault


Jund Midrange:

Pre-board it’s usually a cake walk.  If you are able to counter the rakdos return and keep olivia and garruk off the table


Bant Hexproof:

This is pretty much the matchup you want to dodge on any given day.  The first game is pretty bad and it doesn’t really get that much better after sideboard.  My suggestion is try to race as much as possible with Azorius Charm’s lifelink mode.  I have tried devoting many sideboard slots to this matchup but it rarely gets very much better without drastically affecting other matchups.  I would chalk this up as a tough loss you will likely swallow.


Naya decks:

If they go up to Thundermaw and beyond


Junk Aristocrats:

There are not a lot of important cards in this matchup so it is important to know which ones to counter.  The most important targets are Cartel Aristocrat and Varloz, thundermaws ,and renounce the guilds to clear out all of the problematic cards.  The matchup can become trivial with Rest in Peace but it’s more than good enough without it so I don’t recommend playing the enchantment.


Act 2 Aristocrats (or any red version):

This is a lot harder than the green decks because Falkenrath Aristocrat has no real good answers.  The clock it presents plus the ineffectiveness of Azorius Charm against it makes it a difficult deck to beat.  After board if you keep a hand with Renounce the Guilds and Snapcaster Mage


W/B Humans:

I’m not convinced this deck is real or should have even won the SCG.  The Jund player against AJ Sacher kept some loose hands and paid the price.   The matchup’s win percentage jumps depending on how many pillar of flames you are able to draw.  As always


Mono-Red (and mono-red splash g version)

This is a matchup that comes down a lot to the die roll and how many augur of bolas and pillar of flames you can assemble on turns 1-3.  An on curve hellrider can leave you reeling but warleader’s helix and turn//burn can take him out before he does too much damage.  After sideboard

in conclusion:

good matchups: red agressive decks, WB humans

50/50 matchups: Jund

bad matchups: Act 2 Aristocrats (RBW),False,,t5_2utkz,False,,,t3_1j2rm6

1372562998.0,1hchxk,GP Miami Day 1 report with Act 2,kreldin,26,3,5,"I went 6-3, I dropped; and 5-4 at GP Quebec).

I don't know if anyone is interested in a report from someone who ultimately missed day 2

My deck: Aristocrats Act 2 (http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/act-2-29-04-13-2/)

I threw in Witchbane Orb into the sideboard as a last minute decision late last night. I was trying to figure out some tech against Curse of Death's Hold and other enchantments, as I faced four Jund decks, and Witchbane won me a round against one of them. I felt two was too much, but I never drew it against the other Jund decks. If I would go back, I'd probably take out the Intangible Virtues and Assemble, as I only faced one control deck the entire night, in my ninth round

Round 1: Bye!

Round 2: Junk Reanimator
This is normally a great match up for me. In fact, where was I holding on with a Reckoner and two lingering souls tokens at 9 health. I had another Reckoner in hand, and enough mana to cast that and a Blasphemous Act in the same turn to deal 26 damage (he was at 19). Unfortunately I didn't draw any of the four acts the entire game, and eventually I ran out of chump blockers. This is a situation where the extra two Appetites might have been handy; if I could have prevented one of those Angels from entering the battlefield I would have been golden. I tend not to run gy hate, as I already have such a great match up against Reanimator.

Round 3: Jund Aggro
This was ridiculous. Game 1 he just steamrolled me and won with Falkenrath + Ghor Clan Rampager. I never had a chance to stabilize, slip, act, mark, 3 lands). I should have mulled. He just annihilated me; I was one mana/creature short from casting Act to stabilize and potentially win, and I never drew a sac outlet for my Mark. It was a terrible decision on my part.

Round 4: Jund Midrange
Typical Jund midrange build with Thragtusks and Huntmasters. But she was making some mistakes, I did exact damage to win game 1. Game 2 I just sided in my Marks and stole all her threats and sacced them. I really can't overstate Mark's value in this deck, it's incredible. I probably should just freaking main board it already.

Round 5: GW Aggro
This was essentially a bye. He kept a one lander game 1

Round 6: Jund Midrange
Game 1 I won easily. I think I resolved two Falkenraths, played it turn 4 and shut down the Curse and Bonfire he had in his hand. He didn't have anything after that; he was actually dumbfounded when he looked at the Orb, so I was kinda happy I brought it in. Maybe it wasn't deserving of a place in the SB, as it only won me one game, but the game could have turned out very different otherwise if he had resolved that Curse. 

Round 7: Jund Midrange
Game 1 was an easy win and I was feeling very confident. Game 2 is where it got tricky, but I didn't see a good opening - I did not want to two-for-one myself by blocking the beast token he swung with, and then lose the other token to Olivia's 1 damage ability. I would have been able to slip Olivia, but I felt it was the wrong move. BUt I was terribly wrong. The tokens didn't matter shit, since he was at 6 life at that point and I only needed Obzedat to resolve three more times, not counting what else I may draw before then. Instead, I let Olivia live. On my upkeep, he shoots one of my tokens

Round 8: GW Tokens
This guy was a pain in the butt. A jerk, I beat him and his tokens and walked away with a smile. Again, Mark of Mutiny was my best card. Really wish I Had an electrickery in the side, though.

Round 9: American Control
My first control matchup of the night. His deck was a bit weird, and game 2 I sided in assemble, intangible, and sin collector. He milled me to death game 2 with Jace. I brought in Liliana and made a silly mistake - I had her at 6, facing down a Rest in Peace, Jace and nothing else but lands. I Should have just ultimated her while he was tapped out, but instead I passed turn and she ended up dying to a Warleader's HElix and some other spell. BUt game 3 I recovered and steam rolled him - he just didn't have enough answers for me, but not enough to win.

Total: 6 wins, it just steals wins like it's no one business and has no real terrible matchup, or at least as far as I could tell. I now have two byes for the next GP, so I'm happy.

I'm surprised I didn't play the mirror at all, I had fun and was happy with my performance - aside from the crucial decision in round 7 against Jund with the Obzedat/Olivia interaction, I felt I played great all day. Just sad I won't be able to play Act 2 at another standard GP this year, I've had so much fun playing it.",,False,,False,t3_1hchxk

[BUG Infect] (http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/bug-infect-19-04-13-1/)

Anyways

**ROUND 1** UR Affinity

Game one I was on the draw, but a Vines of Vastwood followed up by a Groundswell ended that game.

Sideboard: -4 Rancor

Game two was a joke. He mulliganed to 4

1-0

** Game 2** 4 color good stuff

So having tested against this player before, it was just a whole bunch of counters and bolts and Snapcasters for all my threats. He nickel and dimed me down.

Sideboard: -3 Rancor

Game 2 I dropped a turn 1 Noble Hierarch

Game 3 it was more of the same of Game 1, my last three cards were my own Spellskites. Tables may have been flipped.

1-1

**Game 3** Mono-Black Discard Control something?

Game 1 was a little odd

Sideboard: -4 Rancor

Game 2 I was dumb and got greedy, he Doom Bladed it. I played bad and I felt bad. That was followed up by 6 turned of lands, by which point he had 2 Racks out, 2 Liliana's Caress, and then forced me to dump my hand, at which point I died.

Game 3 was pretty much the highlight of my night. Turn 1 Glistener Elf followed up by Turn 2 land, Mutagenic Growth win. The dude couldn't believe it.

2-1

**Round 4** UWR Delver

Game 1 was pretty quick. Yet again, which was met by my Apostle's Blessing.

Sideboard: -3 Rancor

Game 2 was more of the same. Glistener Elf then Blighted Agent then Plague Stinger x2 just added up the counters until I swung in for lethal. He looked like he wasn't holding much in his hand

3-1

After the four rounds, we all split. I was more than happy with it.

So the deck runs pretty quick. The biggest problem I have is people with a ton of removal/counters/Snapcasters. But other than that, I'm all ears since I'm really new to Modern. Thanks everyone1",,False,,t5_2utkz,False,,

**Gruul** - Very fast

**Jund**  - Very fast as well

**Naya** - Not too sure on this one.. I assume it is very fast but inconsistent but defends better than the other aggro decks with the FS'ers.

**RDW** A pinch slower than the rest possibly but still fast. Has access to high power if need be but many of the early creatures are very weak. Highly consistent though.

1359709132.0,17opym,"[Standard] GTC Naya discussion - Slots, curve, and new toys",Economize,27,59

I'm going to examine these cards in more of a midrange/""big"" style Naya list

I'd like to start with the discussion on slots (will be organized by 1-drop

Lands -  Now that we have access to 3 different shocks, doing so makes aggro matches a bit tougher (RDW looks to be a big contender!)  I think playing 10 is probably about right, with about 10 more buddy lands, a basic or two, and 2-4 utility lands.

The utility lands that we have to work with are:
Cavern of Souls - Great vs a field of permission and in decks where it can fix well (i.e. humans)
Kessig Wolf Run - Pretty much an auto include
Gavony Township - Allows us to build board presence without overcommitting
Slayer's Stronghold - Makes topdecked creatures a threat, ~resto angel)

***1 Drops***

Avacyn's Pilgrim - The old standby

Arbor Elf - With new GTC shocks, I think 4-5 basic forests is reasonable.  

Pillar of Flame - Frankly, boros elite, cloudfin raptor)  

***2 drop***

Farseek - It ramps

Searing Spear - A versatile burn spell with many applications, last points of burn, etc

Selesnya Charm - A solid charm we have access to with 3 very relevant abilities.  In mid to late game

Boros Charm - Another solid charm we have access to.  Again, it seems less versatile (but more powerful) than Selesnya charm.  

***3 slot***

Boros Reckoner - Insane 3 drop, and can profitably block thragtusk, hellrider, geralf's.  Somewhat of a 'combo' with Clan Defiance to burn them out.  Can be a little hard to cast.

Loxodon Smiter - Another great 3 drop we have access to, and Rakdos Return.

Centaur Healer - Generally not where you want to be.  Can make your aggro matchups a little easier

Borderland Ranger - Almost required before GTC for fixing

***4 slot***

Restoration Angel - Format staple

Huntmaster of the Fells - Archetype staple.  4 power across two bodies and 2 life the turn it comes in is already a good deal and when you add it's ability to flip, why are you playing these colors?!

Hellrider - Not really the deck for it

Ghor-Clan Rampager - Another card that does a lot better in more aggressive decks.  I can see this doing well in R/G aggro or possibly even Naya aggro. 

Firemane Avenger - If we were to take away this card's battalion ability it would be unplayable

***5 slot***

Thragtusk - Format Staple, good vs wraths, one of the reasons to be playing Naya!

Thundermaw Hellkite - Haste

Garruk

***6 slot***

Aurelia - Alone, may be a win more card

Angelic Skirmisher -  May be a sleeper hit card, verdict still out, could be too slow, but this is an incredibly powerful effect.  

***7 slot***

Angel of Serenity - One of the best ways to win a creature mirror between angel loops, though it can be slow and sometimes hard to cast.


***XXXX slot***
Note* I was unsure where to include this on the curve

Bonfire of the damned - If you've ever miracled a bonfire for a come-back victory

Clan Defiance - Seems reasonable

Signal the Clans - So

Mizzium Mortars - I like this card a lot and it's a more 'reliable' bonfire that hits most of the field w/ a split cost.  However

With regards to the PTQ, then lost 3 heartbreakers in a row to knock myself out of prizes. I swore retribution for the next day, and well, I got it!

First of all

&gt; 4 Avacyn’s Pilgrim

&gt; 4 Invisible Stalker

&gt; 4 Voice of Resurgence

&gt; 4 Geist of Saint Traft

&gt; 4 Fiendslayer Paladin

&gt; 2 Ajani

&gt; 4 Rancor

&gt; 4 Ethereal Armor

&gt; 4 Spectral Flight

&gt; 4 Unflinching Courage

&gt; 4 Hallowed Fountain

&gt; 4 Temple Garden

&gt; 4 Breeding Pool

&gt; 2 Hinterland Harbor

&gt; 2 Sunpetal Grove

&gt; 2 Glacial Fortress

&gt; 2 Forest

&gt; 2 Plains

&gt; Sideboard:

&gt; 1 Sigarda

&gt; 1 Nevermore

&gt; 1 Detention Sphere

&gt; 2 Negate

&gt; 2 Selesnya Charm

&gt; 2 Mending Touch

&gt; 3 Ray of Revelation

&gt; 3 Fog

Now that everyone hates me for playing Bant Hexproof with Voices main

**Round 1: Bant Hexproof**

I win the die roll, and using ray to hit his unflinching courage and rancor. My Avacyn’s Pilgrim that took that block died a hero, as it allowed me to swing back with a 12/12 Geist of Saint Traft to end the game.

*I win

**Round 2: Gruul Aggro**

My second round opponent is my friend Cy Cook. You may know him as the guy who popularized the Bant Evolve deck from a few months ago. Anyway, and then drop a ton of enchantments the next turn, followed up by a couple more the next. Game 2 I kept a somewhat shaky hand, without a second white source. I had a Pilgrim, Voice, Paladin and a few rancors and a spectral flight. Sure enough, my pilgrim gets pillared, I make the best play I can to get me to survive a turn at 1 life. He ends up dropping a second Hellrider

*I win

**Round 3: Gruul Aggro**

My third round opponent is the guy who handed me my second loss of the previous day’s PTQ, though when I told him we’d have to settle the series in the top 8, he lightened up a bit. Unfortunately for him, he didn’t make the top 8.

*I win

**Round 4: Bant Evolve**

My opponent for this round is a member of my team/playtesting group. We’re both very familiar with each other’s decks, as we both hand to mulligan to five. Unfortunately for my friend, my five included two land, Pilgrim, GoST, and an Ethereal Armor.  After top decking runner-runner enchantments I roll over him. 

*I win

**Round 5: Selesnya Hexproof**

This round I get to play against the guy who knocked my previous round opponent out of the PTQ the previous day on their win-and-in game. He also almost got DQ’d on a slow play call from what I heard through the grapevine. That being said, as my scorepad had run out at this point. I do know that I lost this round though. More on my opponent’s deck later…

*I lose

**Round 6: America Control**

After doing some math, and had no clue how the whole tiebreakers thing worked. After explaining to him that since his tiebreakers were better than mine, he was 99% guaranteed to make it, while I was more on the order of 95% to make it. He thought about it for a bit, and he agreed to split in. It was a risky split for me, but I felt good about it. We decided to play just for fun anyway. I ended up beating him both games we played very quickly. After the games, he told me that today was not only his first time playing in a “big” tournament

*We split! ID (4-1-1)*

After what seemed like an eternity, but to talk with him first. I thought that was a bit of a dick move, and he later apologized for it. I also thought “Screw him. I can ID if I want to. If it knocks him out, then that’s his fault for not playing better!”
Going into the Top 8, playmats, and a Top 8 pin, and then we get our quarterfinal opponents.

**TOP 8 Quarterfials: Naya Midrange(?)**

I end up winning the die roll (for some reason, and I finish him off quickly with Geist. Game 2 I keep a hand of 2 Temple Gardens, a Hallowed Fountain, a Geist of Saint Traft, 2 Ethereal Armors, and an Avacyn’s Pilgrim. I then proceed to top deck Ethereal Armor on turn 2 and Unflinching Courage on turn 3. Needless to say, this game didn’t last very long. My opponent congratulated me, so that would explain it. 

*I win! 2-0 (5-1-1)*

As we headed into the Top 4

**TOP 8 Semifinals: America Control**

My opponent this round is the aforementioned dude who yelled at me for taking the risky split in. Since I’m not really favored in this match, I notice that I’ve got a lot more people behind me now. I don’t know if this affected me subconsciously or not, but game two ended up falling in my favor. Answers.dek became ThinkTwice.dek, because that’s really all he did. We banter a bit more,  asking each other if we want to concede. Game three is a much faster version of game two, as he doesn’t manage to get much of anything going, and gets stuck on one white source. 

*I win! 2-1 (6-1-1)*

**TOP 8 FINALS: “Barely Boros” Exalted**

Holy shit. I made it to the finals! This was my first “big” tournament Top 8, this guy was doing work on both sides of the table. I end up getting him down to three life while getting myself up to 25 life. He then proceeds to either top deck or otherwise windmill slam a Silverblade Paladin on the table and pair it with the Fiendslayer. He swings in with a 10/10 double striker. I misplay and don’t block with my Pilgrim but I end up scooping them up instead. Game 2 is more of the first game, but this time with a lot more going in my favor. I finish him off with a 16/16 flying, first striking, trampling, and lifelinking GoST. Between games we banter a bit while shuffling, saying how awesome it was to be in the finals. Luckily for me, and I managed to draw nothing but. I finish him off with a massive Fiendslayer Paladin and two invisible stalkers.

*I WIN! 2-1 (7-1-1)*

Overall the weekend was pretty rad. The venue that both events were held at provided us with free coffee, and an assortment of pastry. I had never seen anything like it, and all the players really seemed to be grateful for the free refreshments.

In a nutshell, big green derpy bombs end the game.

My friend handed me his mono-green variant, 3 yeva, 3 scavenging ooze, 4 hydra, etc. It was not running visionaries or pilgrims, which was the major difference. I played the build, but didn't like a few things - namely, first was a miracle for 2 to kill my archdruid and dork) and the lack of consistency without dorks. 

I really enjoyed playing the deck, vorapede). It doesn't immediately out-value aggro decks, but they don't really interact with us, allowing our turn 4-5 plays to turn the game around. Predator ooze is incredibly mean against aggro, as well.

With the main weaknesses being dork vulnerability and lack of consistency

Card choices:

- Farseek - I think farseek belongs in any deck that wants to reliably ramp. This deck, making Farseek unplayable. I wanted Farseek in the deck. It's the only playable 2cmc non-creature ramp spell in standard, and I needed a way to add it. While I didn't want to change the list that much, I figured out how to do it without causing much trouble - spell lands.

- Temple Garden/Gavony Township - Continuing from my previous point

- Craterhoof Behemoth - You can play it through Garruk to play around counters. Usually, as 4 might be too many, but I always want to see this guy at some point.

- 4 new Garruk - when 50% of your deck is creatures, it's very hard to lose.

- Acidic Slimes - This is here for greedy mana decks and hexproof. If we ramp into t3 slime and slime their land

- Scavenging Ooze - These come in versus reanimator (duh)

- Plummet - This deck straight up folds to Olivia Voldaren/Angel of Serenity/Most fliers. This is our cheese tech (and it worked well for me this weekend).

- Selesnya charm - good vs things

- Tree of Redemption - tech vs aggro

This deck has a good matchup against aggro decks

* Has an outlet for possibly large amounts of mana
* Elfball is probably the best combo deck for this land

Things that come to mind:

* **Natural Order deck (Maverick?)**
* Lets us include Garruk
* Knight of the Reliquary can be absurd with it
* **Slivers**
* Could Cradle give it an edge over Fish? My gut feeling is no.

1373643353.0,1i5p7h,[Modern] Crafting Aggro/Control,Lightupthenight,32,10,23,"After seeing Jeff Hoogland's UR Wizard list

1)Splash white for a bigger beater. UWR geist decks all tend to b either heavily aggro focused, utilizing restoration angel. While the white splash would give us access to a huge variety of sideboard options, I feel we would lose one of the biggest advantages Jeff's deck had moving through the rounds, Blood Moon. BM alone, as per Jeff's report, wins games, and consdering the greedy manabases of jund, and UWR

2)Finding more pressure in UR. Delver is a nice clock, which is fantastic in conjunction with a turn 1 delver, but still means there is no set up for him until t3, hooping that your opponent plays nothing counter worthy on their second turn. My houghts turn to the new addition, Young Pyromancer, whose legacy counter magic (FOW and daze) make him a monster of a clock. With no daze in modern, or efficient free counter, I have found, he is highly appealing. Testing him, and is only cast at sorcery speed

3)Which leads into the thrd path, as I have used it in merfolk with great success. The low land count, which enables drawing into more gas and is enabled by the low curve, pushes me away from Cryptic, which helps shore up a lot of problems thanks to the swiss army knife applications.

1373041730.0,1hp4ns,[Standard] Naya - Bonfire vs. Mizzium Mortars,UpThaPunx,26,3,27,"With M14 fast approaching

In [the comments of his GP Miami report](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/26457_Birthday-Wishes-Do-Come-True-GP-Miami-6th.html), but that's just me."" [Mark Eilers](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/inside-the-deck-rich-castle-video-07022013-grand-prix-miami/) also included 4 Bonfires in his Domri-less take on Naya, which more resembles Jund with its Farseek -&gt; high-impact spell strategy. Brian Kibler also lists Bonfire at #1 on his list of cards you should be playing. 

Are these people right? Is this the direction these decks have taken proper? In my own testing, and the Overload cost often has a Plague Wind effect since there are not terribly many 5+ toughness creatures running about (Hellkite and Angel of Serenity being major exceptions, Obzedat being a somewhat irrelevant exception). My main reason for leaving Bonfire in the board was expecting a lot of UWR, which Bonfire is somewhat mediocre against (Mortars at least clears out Augur/Resto), and Boros Reckoner decks, which make a large Bonfire somewhat awkward. I've found myself bringing in Bonfire against the Reckoner decks anyway, though

So I wanted to try something new in Modern and came up with this (now a link instead of a terrible looking attempt at a list):

http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/gw-vengevine-25-06-13-1/

This is an engine deck, and Fauna Shaman.

On their own

After the core 12 cards, I went with Wilt-Lief Liege. This of course led to the Smiters and Finks (I don't own Voices). The Lieges also do a pretty good job of making the mana dorks into threats, especially when combined with Gavony Township. 

Lead the Stampede is awesome in this deck. The deck has 31 creatures

Is this deck Tier 1? Certainly not. But after a day of testing, give it a try. 

So

Thanks.

1371424476.0,1ghbad,[Standard] Grixis Control ft. Master of Cruelties. Can this get to tier 1?,dontsuemewizards,28,6,64,"I've been toying around with Grixis control for awhile, but its not so bad with thinks and alchemies.  Here's what I'm working with now.

**Creatures:**

* 1 AEtherling
* 2 Master of Cruelties
* 2 Snapcaster Mage
* 3 Vampire Nighthawk

**Instants:**

* 3 Forbidden Alchemy
* 3 Searing Spear
* 4 Think Twice

**Sorceries:**

* 3 Mutilate
* 3 Dreadbore
* 4 Pillar of Flame

**Planeswalkers:**

* 2 Chandra
* 2 Jace
* 2 Liliana of the Veil
* 1 Tamiyo

**Lands:**

* 4 Blood Crypt
* 2 Rogue's Passage
* 4 Steam Vents
* 3 Sulfur Falls
* 8 Swamp
* 4 Watery Grave

**Sideboard:**

* 3 Slaughter Games
* 3 Negate
* 1 Dreadbore
* 2 Rolling Temblor
* 1 Mutilate
* 2 Devour Flesh
* 2 Olivia Voldaren
* 1 Rakdos's Return

The Master of Cruelties package seems questionable, but it can win games out of no where.  He can also swing for the win with Chandra or Pillar and passage on turn 6.  Additionally, he is a very strong blocker for any of the other lines of play and can't be removed with pillar, spear, price, or selesnya charm.

The deck can also win with aetherling

1369796467.0,1f8ucp,[Standard] Building a Better Plasm Capture,Awkamess,32,9,59,"Unfortunately, we must ask ourselves a very important. Why are we trying to a force a GGUU counterspell to work in Standard?

Right now midrange archetypes such as Junk reanimator, and Bant are integral parts of the format. These decks usually win by fending off early threats for the first couple of turns and then resolving 4-6 mana win conditions to try and seal the game. Plasm Capture excels against this general strategy. Counter their large threat, untap, play your own large threat for free, hold up burn/countermagic for their next turn.

Against control decks, so you can usually outnumber their answers with the number of threats you have.

Aggro seems to be the worst matchup for Plasm Capture judging by my current testing. Plasm Capture and your other countermagic is completely dead game one. As I mentioned before

Being placed into U/G gives us some powerful tools to begin with. For example:

* Farseek for ramp and mana fixing. Enables a turn 3 Plasm Capture which can be important.
* Augur of Bolas for stall/spell search. Snapcaster Mage is a powerful tool like Augur that also fulfills this role.
* Thragtusk.
* Aetherling is the most resilient bomb this deck can have against control archetypes.
* Garruk
* Progenitor Mimic and Prime Speaker Zegana are interesting U/G finishers for this type of deck.

Let's start with the possible shells that you could put Plasm Capture into. It's pretty much narrowed it down to 3 colors

Bant:

* Reliable board sweeper in Supreme Verdict.
* Powerful bombs in Angel of Serenity and Restoration Angel.
* Instant speed tricks with Advent of the Wurm.
* Azorius Charm and Sphinx's Revelation.

RUG:

* Ral Zarek is a promising 4 drop in this style of deck because the deck is pretty mana intensive.
* Quality burn with Mizzium Mortars
* More midrange hate with Turn // Burn.
* Huntmaster as a mid-game stabilizer.
* Niv-Mizzet Dracogenius as a good card advantage game winner.

BUG:

* Best single target removal with Putrefy and Warped Physique. Also Far // Away.
* Mutilate as a possible board wipe.
* Discard package option.
* Griselbrand as the most “raw power” finisher on this list.
* Reap Intellect? Seems janky.

While I think that Bant probably has the most potential (drawing similarities between a Bant Flash / Prime Speaker Bant hybrid), but it seems to be outclassed by Huntmaster even though this deck can use it’s +1 to ramp effectively.  I’ve been having some mediocre results against aggro, but I’ve been tinkering with Augur of Bolas, Huntmaster and the burn suite to find the best combination to stall out the early game until you can hit 5 mana.

I’m playing about 10 bombs (cards 5+ mana), 5 counterspells, and then 2 think twice/ 3 farseek. I’m not sure any of these ratios are necessarily correct, to be honest. I’m pretty sure that from my list, I could cut the Ral Zareks for more Huntmasters to have a better aggro matchup without having to cut as much top end. I think there is some rationale behind moving a Garruk to the side and replacing it with the fourth Farseek. I wish these colors had a board wipe better than Magmaquake/Rolling Temblor, because I’m not sure they’re good enough to stop the aggressive decks (although I haven’t played them very much in other decks). Wolfir Avengers in the side should probably just be two of the formerly mentioned “board wipes” because you can hit them off of Augur.

1364433971.0,1b5edr,[Modern] Let's talk Loam and viability,OrpheusV,27,3,35,"First

Some notes on the list:

- A good friend (Jaberwocki) ran the list to a top 4 finish at a PTQ a few weeks ago on MTGO

- Talking matchup-wise, especially the gruul lists are rough simply because of how absurdly fast they are, so I'd look to shore up those as well if possible. Tarmogoyfs are the obvious fix here and I'd probably borrow them if I need to. Combo matchups are pretty damn good as well even if twin is still consistent as hell. The only outright awful matchups from play is tron which is just frustrating when they stick a turn 3 karn through the hate and take over the whole game, and kiki pod who has answers for everything apparently. Dredgevine is just awful without hate as they just ride my engine and kill me with it.

- The single Temple Garden is for Ray of Revelation in the sideboard. I absolutely need Ray just because of how much Rest in Peace and Leyline of Sanctity hurts

- Smallpox is amazing tech. If I have the lands

- There's three different archetypes that are rather common here: Affinity, so a playset of Ancient Grudge and maybe some Dragon's Claws might shore up the first two matchups, but the third one gives me a headache. 4x Relic mainboard is rough to fight when they start exiling your stuff all the time.

* I built the list with more hand destruction in mind simply because of Inquisition being one of the best discard spells in the format

I'll get to the point here, Ray of Revelation, Dragon's Claw, and maybe some more Ghost Quarters vs Tron? And I assume the usual graveyard hate will be useful, but which one? Grafdigger's Cage stops their recursion (and mine), but I can eventually kill them with Flame Jab or SS triggers. Tormod's Crypt is free, but eh.

1363055938.0,1a4gwc,Modern deck concept - American Super Friends,,28,6,47,"I was interested in building a Super Friends deck for Modern. I don't have a refined decklist yet but I thought I would discuss it with you all. I'll lay down what I consider to be the most important pillars of the deck. We can discuss whether it can be truly competitive and if so
   
**Planeswalkers** - This is obviously the most important part of a Super Friends deck. If you aren't familiar
    
* [Ajani Vengeant](http://magiccards.info/ddh/en/1.html) - His +1 make a mana problem for an opponent crippling. It can hurt RG Tron by keeping Urza lands down. It can lockdown powerful creatures. His -2 is good for staying in the game and spot removal. His ultimate wins the game.    
* [Elspeth, perhaps after a Supreme Verdict. Her ult is decent in weird circumstances, but it's usually better to just keep producing blockers or enabling powerful attackers.    
* [Gideon Jura](http://magiccards.info/m12/en/16.html) - His +2 protects our other friends
* [Jace Beleren](http://magiccards.info/m11/en/58.html) - Card advantage up the ass. I usually alternate between the +2 and the -1 but the ultimate can serve as an alt win condition.
* [Jace
* [Venser
    
**Counterspells** - These serve the important purposes of disrupting the opponent's early to mid game and protecting our walkers. Most of these will be fairly obvious choices so don't feel bad for skipping my descriptions.     
    
* [Mana Leak](http://magiccards.info/m12/en/63.html) - One of my favorite counterspells ever printed. Very popular for a reason. Very cheap
* [Spell Snare](http://magiccards.info/di/en/33.html) - Cheap as hell (nice with Snapcaster) and works wonders against so many decks. Kills a Tarmogoyf, Tribal Flames (common in my meta), Mana Leak, Remand, Dreadbore, etc.    
* [Spell Pierce](http://magiccards.info/zen/en/67.html) - Weaker of the counterspells
* [Mindbreak Trap](http://magiccards.info/zen/en/57.html) - Free counters occasionally
    
**Removal** - Once again
    
* [Lightning Bolt](http://magiccards.info/pd2/en/17.html) - Simple and classic. One mana for three damage is great value. I usually find myself using this on early-game utility creatures like Bob and Deathrite. I can also save it to zap attackers after I've gotten a walker down so they can build up counters and be safe.      
* [Path to Exile](http://magiccards.info/ddi/en/23.html) - Stupidly good removal. Nullifies undying/persist (usually Kitchen Finks) and indestructible creatures. Really don't have to explain this great card. It serves no special purpose in this deck aside from being cheap so I can cast it early.    
* [Lightning Helix](http://magiccards.info/ddh/en/23.html) - Keeps me from suffering against fast decks and serves as removal. Three-toughness creatures aren't that common in Modern as far as my experience goes (Vexing Devil, but it's value.  
* [Wrath of God](http://magiccards.info/10e/en/61.html) - Relatively cheap boardwipe that goes over the occasional regenerate creature like Lotleth Troll.    
* [Supreme Verdict](http://magiccards.info/rtr/en/201.html) - Bit more color heavy but shouldn't be a problem. ""can't be countered"" is pretty relevant (probably moreso than ""they can't be regenerated"") so I think this is the better boardwipe for this deck.    
* [Electrolyze](http://magiccards.info/cmd/en/197.html) - There are plenty of valuable one or two power creatures seeing play in Modern, hitting the opponent with one to the face, and drawing is a great feeling.
    
**Creatures** - Super Friends decks are usually light on the creatures. The only ones I would consider are ones that serve a very important purpose.     
    
* [Snapcaster Mage](http://magiccards.info/isd/en/78.html) - the only creature I would definitely include in this deck. He's cheap
* [Wall of Omens](http://magiccards.info/cmd/en/37.html) - Might be strong because of generating card advantage and having a good toughness to slow down aggro significantly.     
* [Sun Titan](http://magiccards.info/m12/en/39.html) - Good finisher with relevant things to recur like Snapcaster, Jace, and Tectonic Edge and Phantasmal Image if I include them. Thanks to aspect0 for suggesting Sun Titan.    
* [Vendilion Clique](http://magiccards.info/mt/en/55.html) - Good for neutering combos or just hurting your opponent's game plan. Can also get a decent amount of damage in with 3 power and evasion. The flying can also be good on the defense for protecting my walkers against fliers since it trades high
    
    
I have left out lands and sideboard options
    
* Do you see any cards that should be included that aren't? Why would they be valuable to this deck?    
* Do you see a card here that you don't see as having a place in a deck like this? Why do you see it as being too weak?    
* Do you think a deck like this can be competitive and why?    
* Do you have any questions you'd like to ask me?

The amount of synergy in this list is pretty high. Card draw and card selection wins you games, multiple times in a game. Hard to lose with that much card advantage. 

Farseek and Mana Bloom make going 5 colors fairly easy; I would almost never have any problems casting spells in my hand, though.  

Overall thoughts on my list: Alchemy was a night-before-states change after seeing a teammate do well with it, it searches out that last land you need, and it flashes back to do it a few turns later. Awesome card. if I were going to cut colors from this last, I'd run Alchemy as as 3x easily.

Disciple is, I've been a huge proponent of it, and it DID win me games due to 5 life gain and 5 cards...but I just hate playing it. =/ The 4 drop spot in my list is already full of stuff, and Disciple sucks on an empty board. I may cut it down to 1, if not completely. Disciple is best when you have Restoration Angels, as I would almost always swing for 3 in the air, drop Disciple, because they're good as they are - I don't need 5 cards most of the time when my 5/5 trampler can kill you in two turns. 

Verdict saved my tail plenty of times, I just didn't have the two Vorapedes (I actually have one, but didn't want to run it as a 1x). Running Vorapede also seems to turn the deck into pure aggro, and you just race/outgun your opponent into submission. My list plays more control like - I'll often hold an Armada Wurm in my hand until I know I can drop it and let it do it's work. A lot of my life total sheets from States just have ""20, 10, 0"" for my opponent's life.  Seems like a good way to win...

Also, and while I think Lantern is a good card, I didn't like it in this list at all. Also, there's a hidden benefit to Bloom: people just let it sit there. It's so quiet and unassuming, no big deal, it's only one mana at a time, right? But it hands down lets me win games, and it's not as ""oh man, and it was when my opponent was mana screwed on two land and felt he had to do SOMETHING

If you've yet to try Bloom in your lists, you can just pitch it as a useless card. But even without being able to do that, Mana Bloom was spectacular. There were lots of games were I lay a Bloom for 1 on turn 1, ramp to an EOT angel on turn 3, then replay bloom for 2 on turn 4 to hit the turn 5 Armada Wurm. Yes, technically I lose my turn 2 and turn 4 plays, but I've also hit an Armada Wurm (or Severed a dude I need to kill!), which is often too much for the midrange decks to deal with because they can't sever

1374604545.0,1iwfdn,[Standard] 26th at SCG Open: Richmond,BSent,22,1,26,"To start


I was a big fan of B/R zombies back in the day with 4 falkenrath and 4 tundermaw. Cedric Phillips has been championing a deck recently that had 4 of both, and Naya was a better high curve aggressive deck. After reading Kibler’s article, (http://www.starcitygames.com/article/26461_Taking-My-Dragons-To-South-Beach.html ) I took some of his notes. I dropped the burning tree’s and gyre sage’s for stragleroot’s and putrefry, among other things, while also settling on a split 3-3 spilt of my 4 drops, rampager and huntmaster. I’m sure the list could be improved, but that’s not my strong spot. My final list can be seen here. http://admin.starcitygames.com//deckdatabase/displaydeck.php?DeckID=57566

Round 1: vs. Mitch (GW Ramp) His turn 1 play was elvish mystic,  so in games 2 and 3 Falkenrath and Thundermaw got him. Win 2-1

Round 2: vs. Jason (Jund) He was playing a pretty stock Jund list, but kessig wolf run is pretty good at beating 1/1's for 1. Game 2 I just kind of flooded out, and after he dealt with my only form of pressure, he quickly won. Loss 2-0

Round 3: vs. (Junk Aristocrats) Now this is a match I like to play against. His tokens are just vastly inferior to my stronger creatures. Even cartel aristocrat is a minor annoyance when I have something like Flinthoof Boar. I just have to make sure to use removal on the key threats, but it still gets me now. I mull to 6 and as my opponent cuts he jokes about how he’s giving me a really good one. I told him it was going to be good, and I was going to have a turn 2 domri rade like last game. I play an elvish mystic, and as I draw my first card for the turn, it’s a domi rade. My opponent groans and I plus 1 him and reveal thundermaw helkite just for my opponent to groan again. I suspect he’s holding a lingering souls just I don’t get him when I cast the thundermaw. So I just attack with ground creatures  until I get him low enough to where the thundermaw will just get him anyways. Win 2-1

Round 4: vs. Alan (Naya Aggro) The thingI love about these GWx decks is they have barely any way to deal with my fliers aside from a flier of their own or selesyna charm. He plays experiment one and thalia, and once again he has no way to get there. Win 2-1

Round 5: vs. Voss (Esper Control) He’s playing esper control, but it left him very vulnerable to aristocrat.  Win 2-0

Round 6: vs. Ali Antrazi (Esper Control) Ali is super nice, but for example, I was playing in a legacy open one time, and my opponent shuffled his deck in a way I was able to see some of his cards. From this I saw that he was on show and tell. This was for game 1 and my hand was one I would mulligan. But this hand was actually the nuts against show and tell, so I snap kept , and proceeded to win that game(and the match) Regardless, in game 1, 2 strangleroot geists and an aristorcrat. I play borderland ranger, and get him for 17 exactly. Game 2 his life total goes from 18 to 14 to 10 to 6 to 2. Can anyone guess what this was. I’ll give you a hint; it starts with “F” and ends in “alkenrath aristocrat.” It was actually pretty close because when he as at 2

Round 7: vs. Joe (Jund) His hand has a bunch of removal, and it sticks, and I’m sure everyone can see what happened from there. Pretty straightforward game 2, he mulls to five, I play fliers and win.  Game 3 ends the game with him at 36 life. Double thragtusk and double huntmaster is pretty strong. Loss 0-2

Round 8: vs. Tyler(Esper Control) I’m a bit disheartened at this point as my chances of top 8 are gone with my second loss, and had an emblem in play with another domri in play. He has a lot of answers though and it took us a good 20 minutes to finish the game. This was a super tight game, and I get him to 2. He revs for 8 though, and at this point I concede for time’s sake. With about 10-15 minutes left in the round, we agree to a board state concession. We both want to make top 32, so a draw might as well be a loss. Essentially if it looks like he is going  to win but can’t because of time, I concede, turn 2 haste boar

Round 9: vs. Jarvis Yu(Jund) Jarvis seemed kind of upset when I sat down

I end up in 26th

Placed 11 at SCG Legacy Open in Columbus on 6/17/13 – Playing Omni-Show
Decklist: http://deckbox.org/sets/399922


This was the first big event I had gone to since a sealed event that I went to when conflux was released. I had always wanted to play a show and tell list, I was set in the style of show and tell that I wanted to play.

On to the matches:

**Match 1: CounterTop with Mark**

I won the die roll, which allowed me to go off on my second turn.  Unsure of what he was playing except for a plains, I did not side in the leylines to counter any discard he might have had.

Game 2 I kept a hand with 2 digging spells and a show and tells, I let that resolve thinking it would not slow me down too much, as he would only get about 1-2 uses of it as long as I did not whiff with the digging spells. I preordained and found 1 piece of the combo and passed.  He played a second top and a plains and passed.  I dug again on my turn and found the whole combo while having another cantrip to use with force.  He topped end of turn, played a plains and passed. I untapped, drew a city of traitors which would have let me pay for daze if that is what he was holding and played Show and Tell.  After forcing his spell pierce, Show and Tell resolved leaving him with a Detention Sphere targeting Omniscience.  With trigger on the stack, Cunning Wish into Firemind’s into Cunning Wish and Flusterstorm into trickbind let me secure the win.

1-0	in matches

**Match 2: American with Bryan Hockey**

Losing the die roll, I was able to take game 1. Shuffle up and onto the next game.

Had a turn 2 kill in opening hand with Pact of Negation
	Game 3 was one of the closest matches that I had during the whole tournament, I tried for a show and tell for dreamhalls with enter the infinite in hand along with 2 Force of Wills, a Brainstorm, and a Pact of Negation.  He starts the counter war with his own force, which I meet with a pact, which after resolution is met with a RED on the Show and Tell, which I try to counter with a Force paying a brainstorm, which leads me to have to pay all 5 lands I have on my upkeep and him flashing in a Restoration angel to take the game.

1-1 in matches

**Match 3: American Delver with Donavan** 

Was able to play though his double daze and force and a turn 1 delver that flipped with having City of Traitors as my third land and a Force plus Pact to secure game 1.

Game 2 was another counter war that started with Show and Tell getting Dazed, then finally Forcing his Pyroblast.

2-1 in matches

**Match 4: Elves with Justing Hertel**
 
I have never played against an elves deck before, with him fizzling off his turn 3 Glimpse of Nature, I was able to win on my turn 3 as elves cannot really answer a show and tell.  

Game 2 I lost as he did not fail to combo off on turn 3

Game 3 I was able to Show and Tell on turn 3 to win, Justin said that he decided not to side in anything vs me, since it would only slow him down and he thought just being able to pretty consistently combo off on t3 would be better than drawing a discard spell.

3-1 in matches

**Match 5: Sneak and Show with Stephen Rakovich**

Very nice guy, for which I showed a Dream Halls.  Passing the turn, I was able to brainstorm and draw and Enter the Infinite to seal the game, even with facing down an Emrakul.

Game 2 he said after the match he sided would some of his Show and Tells for Misdirections.  With him going first , along with an Intuition as well as a cunning wish, I felt I was safe to let him, as I could wish for something to put in, or wish for a Force of Will for more protection or Intuition for Omniscience should the need arise.  He plays 2 lotus petals on his third turn followed by a sneak attack with 1 mana open and 3 cards in hand, not wanting to lose to an Emrakul, I decide it would be best to Force the Sneak Attack.  He then Spell Pierces my force, I decide to pay for it rather than leave mana open in order to win on my turn.  He then tanks for a while and calls a judge while spell pierce is still on the stack.  After talking with the judge for a few minutes the force resolves and I go on to win on my turn 3 with a luckily drawn enter the infinite. The question that he was asking was that if he was allowed to move my Force of Will with one of the 2 Misdirections that were in his hand to his spell pierce after I paid for it.  He did not ask the right question

4-1 in matches

**Match 6: ANT with Scott Ruggirero**

I had played against Scott the night before in a side event and got crushed the last time

This was the first match that I felt I needed to side in the 3 Leyline of Sanctity in order to both counter his tendrils and his discard. The first time I did this the night before, and with him unable to draw a chain of vapor, I was able to win off of 3 cunning wishes in a row in order to combo off with force backup. 

5-1 in matches. 11-3 in games

**Match 7: BUG with Justin Geary**

Losing the die roll and getting hit with 2 discard spells plus a spellpierce when I tried to show and tell to not die lost game 1 for me.
Game 2 even with siding in the 3 leylines, even if he had no counters in his hand.

5-2 in matches

**Match 8: Shardless BUG with Brad Hammond**

With me winning the die roll and him mulling to 5
Game 2 went about the same

6-2 in matches

**Match 9 : Feature Match with _______________**

I do not know what he was playing unfortunately, and did not want to lose the match due to him wastelanding my Ancient Tomb that I had as my only land and then needing to get 3 lands instead of just draw the 1 I needed to in order to go off on T3.

I saw that he was playing Black or Green, of which I got 1 in my opening hand in game 2. He had no answer to it, and it was a T3 Show and Tell in order to win the game.

**Final Record: 7-2

I was happy with how the deck preformed, it may even be ban worthy, and since the sideboard is mainly wish, there are really only 3 cards that need to come in, which any game they came in took the place of the Pact of Negations in the main board.

As far as the sideboard goes:
* I never faced dredge, then Surgical can probably be replaced.
* I never had to play against death and taxes, so depending on the Meta this card is not necessary.
* I did not face belcher or a deck that ran Chalice of the Void
* Force/Pact should stay
* Firemind’s foresight seems like a card that does not really need a slot, it almost always becomes another Cunning wish or Intuition + Flusterstorm + Impulse. If you have Dream Halls out, it works in your favor by netting you 1 card, as long as Impulse is still in the deck verses going Cunning Wish straight for Intuition.
* Intuition needs to stay in the sideboard so that you can find an enter the infinite off of an Omniscience resolving.
* Trickbind needs to stay in because it stops almost every deck’s answer to Show and Tell resolving and cannot be responded to.

Since I did not know the field I had the sideboard as it was

1 Noxious Revival

1 Slaughter Pact

1 Research // Development

1 Wipe Away

1 Trickbind

1 Firemind’s Foresight

1 Intuition

1 Force of Will

1 Laboratory Maniac

4 Leyline of Sanctity – slightly more discard hate

2 Defense Grid – deal with the multitude of counters I had to deal with all day


TL;DR: Went to my first large legacy event and decided to try my hand at writing a deck report

1371571900.0,1glaw2,[Legacy] 7th at SCG Columbus with BUG Walkers - Report,Darkm27,26,5,15,"In the words of our own Jeff Hoogland ""Okay

**Round 1 - Death Blade**

Game 1 was very grindy and I ended up pulling it out at 1 life thanks to a Deathrite Shaman and a Jace. Game 2 started looking really bad really fast so I scooped to save some clock for game 3 which paid off when my Garruk killed him in turns.

1-0

**Round 2 - Aggro Loam**

Due to the nature of Loam decks we had a 35 minute grind fest game 1 that ended with my Garruk fighting a Countryside Crusher to clear the way for my factories. Game 2 was somewhat close but I got stuck on lands and died to a big knight. We started Game 3 with 2 minutes on the clock and shockingly drew the match.

1-0-1

**Round 3 - Aggro Loam**

In what is probably a first in open series history I hit my second aggro loam opponent in a row. Game 1 I won the die roll and landed a deathrite shaman before he could chalice on one. The shaman was able to widdle him away while I kept him on one land with a wasteland lock. Game 2 ended in a similar fashion. 

2-0-1

**Round 4 - U/W Miracles**

I thought game 1 was going to be over before it began as I mulled to 5 with a one lander. I was able to climb back in when I wasted my opponents 2nd land and spell pierced his Rest In Peace. We both looked at each other for a few turns and discarded before either of us found a 2nd land. Typically durdleing occurred until I blew him out with a deed killing a detentionshipere on my lilly, and an enginereed explosives on 1 you can use your imagination from there. Game 2 I ruined his hand with a raven's crime and liliana and killed him with factories.

3-0-1

**Round 5 - U/W/R Midrange**

Game 1 was sort of a blow out as I thoughtseized his Jace and deeded his board away with some man lands to clean up. Game 2 was quite the nail biter however. At one point I was at 4 life facing down a stoneforge, a lilly edict, and a waste land. A few turns later he lands a V-Clique on the end step which is met with my brainstorm dredging my darkblast in combat. After I had successfully stabalized at 4 a shaman and a factory where able to beat him down while Jace filtered his draws. I ended up seeing my opponent at the top 8 meeting later so it worked out for him.

4-0-1

**Round 6 - Reanimator**

Game 1 was pretty quick as a turn 1 thought seize saw an Iona, and some lands. After taking the careful study I resolved a Shaman on turn 2 and locked him out. Game 2 was lead with a thoughtseize into a goyf that was followed up with a clique and a force on his carefulstudy to take it down in 2 games.


5-0-1

**Round 7 - Zoo**

Game 1 was very long and very grindy. I made a mistake I won't be making again in auto pioliting when I think I have it locked up. I did not wasteland my opponents 2nd land and he ended up drawing the game with a price of progress while dead on board to my death rite shaman. Games 2 and 3 where not nearly as close however has I was able to stabilize fairly quickly with removal for his creatures and wastelands for his mostly non basic mana base.

6-0-1


**Round 8 - Camera match versus Death Blade**

I was a little bit worried when my opponent had a turn 2 stoneforge on the play but was able to grind it out with liliana and cabal pit killing him 25 minutes later with a pair of factories. Game 2 was a little more in my favor after a k grip on his batterskull early on. The feature match can be watched [here](http://blip.tv/scglive/scgcol-lgc-rd-8b-michael-kletz-vs-justin-geary-6605038)

7-0-1

**Round 9 - Intentional Draw**

After doing some tie breaker math with Hoogland I was for sure in with a draw and my opponent had similar feelings.

7-0-2

**Quarterfinals vs Todd Anderson**

The match can be found [here](http://www.twitch.tv/m/25901). Game 1 was an absolute grind fest. At one point todd had double my lands with a jace and creature advantage but I was able to grind him out and take over the game with a cabal pit. Game 2 was very close and the weight of the day and being sick was setting in. I let Todd untap with a karakas when I had a deed for his geist and lost rather quickly after that. Between games 2 and 3 Todd requested we take a short break and get me some water because I looked like death and felt like passing out. Game 3 Todd had the very strong opener his deck needs to beat mine and I wasn't able to recover. Lesson learned always drink water during these things especially when your sick...

**In conclusion**

The deck felt extremely powerful all day and I'm for sure playing it at the invitational in Somerset next month. The cards I'm looking at changing are the spell snare from the main deck also the Raven's Crime and Notion Thief from the sideboard. I have a few different ideas in mind for the changes like an exploration but thats still to be figured out. I enjoyed writing this so I hope you enjoyed reading it!

The idea of this thread is to get us talking about Sealed strategies for GP Vegas or to just be a better Limited player. So lets discuss the two pools and talk about what would be best to build from them.

Below is my reasoning for the two decks I created:

Deck1:

I think the Green/White appear to be strong (white having the single good removal spell)

Deck 2:

When I was going through this I immediately noticed the numerous amount of combos for Jiki and decided to try and build around that

I also splashed green for alternate win conditions with Cloak and Tromp. But the more I look at this pool the more I wonder if abandoning Jiki all together is a better idea and to focus on G/W/? to use the kitchen flinks and white control cards,,False,,t5_2utkz,False,,True

- Memory adept is obviously quite good. We have [this deck](http://sales.starcitygames.com//deckdatabase/displaydeck.php?DeckID=54805) that runs 3, and is often a solid finisher for him.

- One of Obzedat main. I'm not a fan of this - it never seems to be that incredibly helpful. To be fair

- Forbidden alchemy is a great card, but there's already so much draw in the deck it doesn't seem necessary.

- Ghost Quarter seems solid. I've talked to a couple people running it and they've said it's fantastic for Caverns and Kessig - both of which wreck Esper. People I've talked to run one main

- ""Superfriends"" Esper control (Like [this](http://sales.starcitygames.com//deckdatabase/displaydeck.php?DeckID=54796)). I've always been a fan of Superfriends

So those are my thoughts

I've been tempted to give this archetype a shot for a while now

- Terminus could be good against Aggro

1363725629.0,1am74m,[Standard] UWr Midrange or Flash,Apertural,27,6,54,"So I'm playing UWr and I would like to bring up that there are 2 different kind of list out here for these colors. I play the Flash Version at the moment but I am leaning towards going Midrange.

These are my lists

http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/uwr-flash-16-03-13-1/ - Flash

http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/uwr-midrange-18-03-13-1/ - Midrange


**Midrange or Flash**

On one hand you have the Flash deck that has been popular and has done fairly well in tournaments.[This list took 8th at GP Verona](http://www.mtgtop8.com/event?e=4503&amp;d=226130) it's the more traditonal Flash list other than the 2 main board Assemble the Legion. It uses the Boros Reckoner and Harvest Pyre combo and the rest of the list is what we've been seeing as of late from UWr.

Then there is the Midrange deck that runs Thundermaws

So which would you play and why is one the better choice?

**Mainboard**

I've been feeling Boros Reckoner to be Very lackluster in my deck and have been debating running Geist over him and this is what brought me to the Idea of running a Midrange deck instead of the flash. 

With access to Thundermaw Hellkite maindeck we lose our weakness to Lingering souls which is a problem with all the Junk decks starting to pop up that use this card as a 2-3 of. 

Some list I've seen run Aurelia and I find this to be interesting also the deck seemed to be more midrange focused instead of flash. [Here is the list](http://www.mtgtop8.com/event?e=4551&amp;d=226391).


**Sideboard**

The sideboard is something to talk about also

I think Geist is a must in the flash list if you want to play more aggressively you can swap him with Reckoner.

Supreme Verdict Sideboard is better than having it mainboard in my opinion in the flash version. With Boros Reckoner as such a defensive card that they can't attack into you can have enough time to stabilize and take over the game. 

Assemble has been very promising. It puts Control in a difficult spot since they can't deal with it very well and in other match ups they are really good chump blockers and put you ahead if the game continues to drag on. 


With Junk rites using Obzedat now and the rise of Assemble decks we need a way to deal with then and I think Urgent Exorcism is that card it's instant speed so it can deal with Obze and Assemble as soon as they come out if they are really an issue.


**Why isn't this deck a good choice? What Else should I play?**

Other than Junk Rites deck what are our bad match ups? How do we deal with these kinds of decks and what can we change in the deck and board to have a better chance at these decks?

Are there better decks to be playing in the current meta?

Is a more aggressive take the right way to go though?

It also allows you to stay on defense for most of the game and kill them from nearly half life with end step Boros Charm

Notably out of the current decks UWR Flash matches up best against the various Saito decks RG and Naya Aggro strategies and even Jund Aggro has issues against either build or UWR.

Against Birthing Pod it does work

&gt;[Suppression Field](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=83617)

After getting crushed by Sire Jund last night with my Wolf Run Bant deck, as Sire punishes all of the decks that run Wrath effects, which mean Wrath effects will probably be at a low for the near future. Spamming tokens into play makes their Sires pretty bad, and also gives you a leg-up in the aggro matchups, where hopefully you can then go over the top with Intangible Virtue or Collective Blessing.

I'm jumping between Junk, so mashing them together into a 4-color monstrosity doesn't seem like a great idea. My thoughts on each of the decks:

**Junk**

* Ready//Willing is insane

* Advent of the Wurm is a great new addition

* Lacks ways to generate card advantage other than 2-for-1 token makers and PWs

**Bant**

* Loses Lingering Souls and Sorin

* Snapcaster is awesome (had to put this twice, Midnight Haunting... good stuff.

* Sphinx's Rev. is playable

**Esper**

* Lingering Souls, and potentially Call of the Nightwing means lots of evasive creatures, but smaller than those of the other decks

* Talrand proper could have a slot

* Snapcaster can be a big player

* Tokens all have flying

* Access to far//away and sphinx's rev for card advantage

* Probably the most controlling

Vs. Aggro decks: Not terribly good, Loxodon Smiter or Restoration Angel and cast this card, cloning one of the 4 dudes I just named, it should put the game out of reach for those decks.  For something like a Bant Hexproof deck it is probably too slow still, but if they stumble or go all-in on a GoST and you can survive to cast this, you should win.


vs. Control decks: Again, but again, if you can get it to start pooping out tokens of itself, it should put the game out of reach, no matter how many wraths and bounce effects they have.


vs. Midrange (and Reanimator) decks: this is where the Mimic truly shines.  They play a Thragtusk, thank you very much.  Craterhoof Behemoth? Assuming you survive the hoofing, you can Hoof right back.  Even cloning something cheap like a Fiend Hunter, Boros Reckoner, or Falkenrath Aristocrat means you have probably just stabilized the board and threaten to over-take them if you untap with it still alive.


""The Flex Role"" : depending upon how you build your deck, Restoration Angel #5-8, Acidic Slime #3-6, and any other cards I can't think of.  The extra mana cost should be viewed here not as a hinderance, but a down payment of what it's ability does.  It forces your opponent to answer it right away, or the game will quickly fall out of their reach.

1366398316.0,1coxj8,[Standard] Shadow Carpet Primer,Awkamess,25,5,14,"**Introduction**

Shadow Carpet (or ""Peddle to the Metal"" / RUG staticaster-peddler splashing black) is a deck that originated in Grand Prix Atlantic City and brought to the attention of the masses by Brad Nelson. Brad piloted [this list](http://mtgtop8.com/event?e=4185&amp;d=224451) to a 3rd place finish in the event. During my down time, I've been trying to create a more competitive version for the current meta over the last two weeks; improving the control matchup. I'll give a basic overview of the deck I'm playing right now and discuss major card choices.

**Decklist and Reasoning**

You can usually find my most updated list that I'm playing on [TappedOut](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/shadow-carpet/). My sideboard is constantly in flux

**Creatures** (26):

4 Nightshade Peddler

The ""combo"" creature of the deck

4 Izzet Staticaster

The main other half of the ""combo"". Izzet Staticaster by itself is a little better than Peddler however. Being able to pick off Junk's mana dorks and pick on their mana very important. A solid blocker for all the 2/2s in naya blitz

4 Thragtusk

Thragtusk is just a powerhouse in this deck. While Restoration Angel is not included in this list

4 Huntmaster of the Fells

Similar to Thragtusk. While not having Restoration Angel is a bit of downside, if you pair Huntmaster to Peddler, when Huntmaster flips into Ravager it can take a creature with its 2 damage to it. Good value overall. 

3 Yeva

I started with only a single copy of Yeva in Shadow Carpet

3 Prime Speaker Zegana

Prime Speaker is the Sphinx's Revelation of Shadow Carpet. Easily drawing up to 5-6 cards with little effort. Keeps the hand full and stocked with combo pieces. Chaining Zeganas is usually very easy to do

2 Olivia Voldaren

Olivia is the card that tips the Junk matchup into our favor. Stealing their Angels of Serenity or Thragtusks is very good and it can become a become a bulky evasive beater. When paired with Nightshade Peddler

2 Borderland Ranger

Not too much to say about Borderland Ranger

**Non-Creatures** (10):

3 Domri Rade

Domri is a card I'm really not sure how I feel about yet. People keep telling me that it's bad, hexproof, and trample. Fighting with Nightshade Peddler is also very good.

4 Farseek

Farseek is really important in this deck. Getting a turn 3 Yeva, but can take lands out of the deck to help it hit a little bit more. Also helps with the atrocious color fixing I mentioned earlier.

3 Grisly Salvage

I've been playing grisly salvage

**Important Lands**:

One of each basic

Only important for borderland ranger.

1 Kessig Wolf Run

Could probably go up to two and cut a salvage (increasing the land count slightly) because this card is so good. It turns our dead peddlers or staticasters into threats for every deck and functions well with the tokens that huntmaster and thragtusk leave behind. Also makes the extra farseeks and borderland rangers relevant in the late game.

1 Alchemist's Refuge

I've like this card in all of my testing because instant speed has so much versatility

**Notable Cards I've Tried**:

Deathrite Shaman

I like deathrite shaman and I understand it has a lot of potential

Master Biomancer

A little too gimmicky for the deck and requires a huge commitment to the board to make it work effectively. Tested one copy that I ended up cutting.

Evil Twin

Like DRS, so I put two in the sideboard. Speaking of sideboard...

Rakdos's Return

This is a local meta call for me. None in the mainboard because most of my local meta is Naya blitz/ other aggro

**Sideboard**:

While the sideboard on TappedOut is a little outdated (I was trying out an experimental snapcaster mage package)

4 Deathrite Shaman
2 Evil Twin
2 Rakdos's Return
2 Abrupt Decay
2 Duress
1 Pillar of flame
2 Slaughter Games

While a sideboarding guide would be a little long (and I'm running out of space by now)

Deathrite and Evil Twin against Junk because Deathrite gets to hate their graveyard and possibly ramp us early on. It helps us recover from being slimed as well. Evil Twin copies everything in their deck for usually a lot less mana than they're paying for it.

Abrupt decay and pillar of flame for aristocrats (or Naya Blitz) usually. Abrupt is good against reckoner in general

Duress

**Matchups**:

General information about the more common matchups.

Naya Blitz

Usually very easy. Your creatures are better than theirs after ~turn 5 and it isn't very hard to stall that long with peddler

Junk Rites

I find this matchup to also be favored on our side. Their superficial amounts of removal make peddler/staticaster great and olivia can steal all of their threats with ease. Watch our for angel of serenity and try to make it so that you have an out to it at all times

Esper Control

Peddler and Staticaster/Olivia are usually pretty dead in this matchup

Running out of words so I'll cut it out here. Would love to hear your questions

Tournament report inside.,jmeyer40,27,6,12,"I became tired of seeing Top-8 finishes with almost nothing but Reanimator, so I decided to try my hand at a different kind of control deck: B/W/R. The original idea stemmed from a deck I played on Cockatrice. It focused on creature removal and getting Obzedat out

After a bit of tweaking here and there




Tournament 1

Round 1 vs. Rakdos Burn: 2-0

Game 1: Both my deck and my opponent's deck drew a bunch of creature removal

Game 2: My opponent didn't have a great hand. I ended up getting Olivia Voldaren out and a turn later used Unburial Rites to reanimate Obzedat




Round 2 vs. R/B Demonic Rising: 2-1

Game 1: This deck revolved on having a Rakdos Keyrune and a Demonic Rising in play to get a steady stream of demons. I made a mistake with Faithless Looting and discarded a Dreadbore and kept a Searing Spear. He played a Bloodgift Demon, dealt me 18 damage in one turn.

Game 2: I played a couple of Lingering Souls and flashed them back. I whittled my opponent down to 3. After a couple turns

Game 3: Used Slayer's Stronghold and lingering souls to deal heavy damage. My opponent got land screwed




Rd 3 vs. Esper Control: 0-2

Game 1: Wore him down over and over

Game 2: Sided in Duress, Reckoner, 2 spirits. Then he drew and cast another Planar Cleansing. Next turn--Rest in Peace.  Killed me with Augur, Resto Angel, and Snapcaster.




Round 4 vs. BUG Undying Tempo: 1-2

Game 1: held my opponent for a while, and Dreg Mangler.

Game 2: Cast Olivia Voldaren

Game 3: His Evil Twin copied my Reckoner



In the end, and Divine Reckoning was dreadful in the deck. I also ended up sideboarding out Assemble the Legion nearly every match, so I needed to replace those.



After tournament one, and Blasphemous Act, and I replaced them with 4 Resto Angels and 2 Runechanter's Pikes. In the SB, I put Slaughter Games in for control matchups and Gloom Surgeons in for Aggro matchups.

Tournament 2

Round 1 vs. G/W Jank: 2-0

Played against a high school student with a thrown-together deck. Both games ended fairly quickly.




Round 2 vs. Miracle Grow Delver (U/G): 0-2

Game 1: Tokens and a Delver wore me down

Game 2: Stupidly kept a hand with 4 land and 3 Boros Reckoner. Basically just lost to one delver. Couldn't draw any removal.

This match was the worst the deck ever drew. In both games, and a couple removal spells. No Resto Angels, Faithless Looting, etc. 




Round 3 vs. Esper Spirits: 2-1

Game 1: All my opponent's spirits ended up being 4/4s, and finished me off. This single-handedly lost me the game.

Game 2: My opponent was land-screwed

Game 3: My opponent could have overwhelmed me with spirits, I used Liliana to make him sac a creature and killed the other with a Searing Spear I top-decked, finishing him off with my angel.




Round 4: Draw into top 8.

They are the only way to truly ""win"" the metagame.

Even though the current meta has a bit of a ""rock-scissor's-paper"" meta, beats ""paper"" and does decently against ""scissors"".  Sure, those decks might be able to easily adapt to crush you, but they won't.  This is a one-shot deck (even if you play it at a couple tournaments) that will be retired if it ever becomes popular.

In this thread

**Esper Control** - [As played by Ben Stark](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/ptgtc13/top_8_decks)

* Non-targeted removal with heavy board-wipes
* Heavy card-draw and card-efficiency
* Minimal creatures
* Decking as primary wincon
* Sideboards well against combo decks.

Possible Weaknesses:

* Non-creature-based control  
* Evasive aggro
* Mana intensive
* Combo before sideboard
* No permanent removal


**Jund Midrange** - [As played by Owen Turtenwald](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/ptgtc13/top_8_decks)

* Efficient
* Moderate planeswalker presence
* Solid Hand destruction
* Variety of removal
* Strong sideboard against control
* Moderate (land/creature) ramp component
* Solid X-spell direct damage

Possible Weaknesses:

* Weak against permission before sideboard.
* High curve without ramp.

The common factor between these decks is the pre-sideboard permission.  Both decks have the potential to be vulnerable to combo/permission prior to sideboard.  Both decks are very mana-intensive and vulnerable to an environment that slows down mana availability or enables card-draw.

Anyone else have some ideas/input?

9 Rounds of Swiss:
Round 1: Bant Enchantment Combo - Had no idea what this deck was about. Game 1 I just stormed out with a turn 1 Jace's Phantasm followed by an Archive Trap on his turn after he fetched. Played a 2nd Phantasm and ended it quickly. I wasn't really sure what to board since he didn't play any creatures and I didn't see much so I only added surgical so add synergy with Archive Trap. 2nd game I didn't start out nearly as fast


Round 2: Mono Red Burn - First game I hit a Phantasm/Trap combo. That 5/5 Flyer was too much for him to handle. Game 2 he layed a Pyrostatic Pillar after laying down Goblin Guides. With that damage advantage and no way to remove it we went to game 3. Finally Delver comes through big time

Round 3: Show &amp; Tell - One of the few Legacy decks I knew about and was prepared for. Game 1 he had a Show &amp; Tell backed up by a Force of Will so that was ugly. I SB in all my Curfews and Surgicals for any creature hate I had. He tutored for 3 Show &amp; Tell which made a beautiful Surgical Target. I then Surgical'ed his Sneak Attack after I Acrhive Trap'ed him. He actually started the beats with 2 Spirit Apes and I was getting nervous. I had to Snapcaster just to trade twice, not that it mattered with *3* Curfews in hand. (2-1) (2-1)

Round 4: Mefolfk - Not excited about this match as I've tested against a friend's Modern Merfolk and did not fair well. I got a Delver turn 1 that didn't flip. Turn 2 I dropped another Delver and Ponder'ed to set them up. After flipping I won quickly. Game 2 was awesome for him he his Aether Vial and started with the Lords. Once they start landing there is no answer at all. Mutavault is also something I'm not a fan of. Game 3 he got himself stuck on 1 land with no Vial. I would so I'm sorry for him

Round 5: Dredge - Another deck I knew about so I was prepared post SB. First game I got stomped by zombies given these enchantments that were in his yard. I SB all Surgical and Crypt. I had to Mull but had 2 Ponder's and a Preordain. I figured it was enough dig to try to find a SB answer. In retrospect as his deck was so dedicated to the Yard I should've tried to Mull until I hit a Crypt

Round 6: MUD - I had no idea what this deck was about. I crushed him game 1
The second game I saw it going off. He ramped into Wurmcoil Engine and Lightening Greaves for the game. Once I saw it I knew that the Curfews all had to go in. I started the early beats with Delver and had him on the ropes. Kuldotha Forgemaster made me nervous because I saw he put in Ratchet Bomb. After I attacked him and had him within one attack step of winning I Ponder'ed into Curfew. He had to return it to his hand and left him with no other outs. (2-1) (4-2)

Round 7: American Delver - I started with a Delver then Dazed his. I got one attack in before it was Bolted. I was able to slam a turn 3 GoST. I flashed in a Snap to trade. He tried to play another one

Round 8: RUG Delver - I was 14 seconds late and got a game loss. I was on the play and dropped a Delver and Dazed his Delver. I dropped another Delver that both of the flipped on my turn. I started the beats with some counter magic. and his Sylvan Library got out-tempo'd. Now that I could SB I threw in the Gut Shots. He started with a Delver that I was able to Gut Shot before laying down one of my own. He ponder'ed before playing a land so I Dazed it. Turns out he kept a one land hand. Mine flipped and started swinging. He tried to Ponder without playing another land so I Pierce'd it. No land again. I laid a Phantasm and another Delver. He finally hit land and started land Mongoose's

Round 9: Storm - So I guess people use storm in this format too. I only saw a Gitaxian probe game 1 before he scooped. I had no SB cards for this match up (Mindbreak where are you??). He was able to go off turn 0 and get 12 tokens. Being honest with myself I just scooped them up. Game 3 he had to mull which I had to assume was crazy risky with that kind of deck. I landed a Phantasm and then he missed his land and passed. I swung and Ninjitsu'd into a daze. He exiled a Spirit Guide for that 1 mana 2 mana producing and I Dazed it. With no land for him I started the beats and kept playing creatures. With him at 3 life he stormed into a Pyroclasm just to stay alive. I landed a Clique and won with that. (2-1) (6-3)

Overall: Finished the day in 52nd. I was really impressed with how a $220 deck functioned. I have to say My first impressions of this format are positive ones. I will definitely be trying to get more into this. I'd appreciate any opinions of changes for this deck and how to broaden the SB to help against different match ups. Thanks!

The deck plays lots of very good cards and tries to achieve maximum value from them. The looting package (faithless looting, the cards thrown away are always either cards that are of no current use anyway, or cards which provide value in the graveyard and for all intents and purposes the discard is irrelevant, as you simply keep the best cards for the situation. Unburial rites can also simply be used as reckoner/blood baron 5-8.  

In terms of threats, and the single angel of serenity solves difficult board states and just provides insane value. I often feel like gideon is one of the best cards in the deck. Unanswered he will win games very quickly, and behind a wall of reckoners and lingering souls tokens it's very difficult to deal with him. 

Liliana is probably the best card in the deck, and otherwise just grinding down their hand. She prays on decks with slow starts, or players who keep bad hands. In combination with the discard package in the sideboard, this deck can really tear apart an opponents hand and library, whilst you drop lots of very difficult to answer threats.

I like curse of death's hold. Whilst expensive, it can just be discarded to looting or liliana, but I feel like it's slot is warranted by how much better it makes certain matchups for you game 1.

* Assume that 3 colors is standard.
* Guildgates seem to be worth taking in your top 5 picks.
* Cluestones should be in your last 5 picks.
* Prioritize a Gatecrash guild in your first pack to increase the likelyhood that it will be passed back to you in pack 2.
* 4 and 5 color trash is quite playable.

Some of the better color combinations:

* WBr:  Good combination for aggro or control.  If your table is fairly stable

* WUx:  Azorius tempo seems solid with or without a splash if you can find it open.  Several under-drafted GTC cards synergise very well:  [Keymaster Rogue](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=366380)

**Master of Cruelties** - Seems like a good sideboard against control, with no mainboard due to its high cost.

**Puetrify** - Great card for both sideboard and main. Instant speed removal, not many artifacts currently see standard play.) Still, 3 cmc is a bit expensive for an aggro that typically aims for a very low mana curve, especially when it has beefy, hasted creatures to play instead.

**Spiked Jester** - Burning-tree variants may not consider this an option, just a bit off color for the currently favored 2 drops.

**Blood Scrivener** - As with Spiked Jester, 2 drops. Still, the card advantage for aggro is great, especially considering how often and quickly Jund Aggro can empty its hand onto the field. Definite mainboard possibility.

This is a preliminary list I came up with:

    3 Think Twice
    2 Forbidden Alchemy

    4 Drowned Catacomb
    2 Dragonskull Summit
    1 Island
    1 Swamp
    1 Mountain
    2 Cavern of Souls
    25

    Sideboard:
    
    2 Rakdos Charm
    4 Izzet Staticaster
    1 Sire of Insanity
    2 Evil Twin
    2 Underworld Connections
    3 Duress
    1 Dreadbore

My thoughts are:

1. EOT Overloaded Rift followed by Sire = gg.
2. Against Aggro
3. Against Midrange
4. Against Control
5. Reanimator is probably the worst matchup pre-board but that can be shored up post-board.  Bouncing things are generally better in the early game anyway.



Other cards I've thought about but either no space or don't think it's as good:

1. Mizzium Mortars: I feel that Dreadbore is just better at this slot.  The option to hit PW seems more relevant compared to the option to overload.  I also don't want to Mortars a Reckoner whereas Dreadbore happily does that job.
2. Jace: don't think he does near enough compared to Ral.
3. Bolas: too slow.  This isn't a Gilded Lotus build.
4. Counterspells: permissions in general don't seem to mesh w/ Sire.

Cards I want to fit in but I don't think is as good as the current 75:

1. Tamiyo: more PW based control build.  Might be interesting to try.
2. Rakdos Keyrune: 5 on turn 4 is pretty good for all of the fuse cards.  Not sure if worth it.
3. Staff of Nin: don't know if I can fit in that many 6 drops.
4. Aetherling: feels like this deck wouldn't get to the amount of mana needed to run this guy out successfully.


So this is just a preliminary list.  I would love to hear other people's thoughts.",,t5_2utkz,1366897214.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1d16xx/postdgm_standard_brainstorming_grixis/

1366065959.0,1cf5zf,[Primer &amp; Discussion] Bant Delver in Standard,Killblue,22,2,17,"*""Delver?! Without Ponder

- Competitive Magic Community

_______________________________________________________

**Background**

A few weeks ago, and, immediately, we saw how powerful the deck was. Even without the ability to profitably line-up Delver flips, the deck can still perform, with great success, as an intense tempo deck. 

______________________________________________________

**The Deck**

[For reference

I just love playing this deck. The versatility is phenomenal, and pulls all of its shenanigans against Aggro. 

*The Guys*

- 4x Delver of Secrets
- 4x Snapcaster Mage
- 4x Geist of Saint Traft

I'm not really sure much needs to be said about these choices. Snapcaster is an all-star in a deck with such a low average CMC. Geist of Saint Traft turns Rootborn Defenses and

The original list ran Cloudfin Raptor. I played with him for a week or so and wanted to rip the card in half most of the time. Yes, but other times it just felt like a dead spot on the board, especially given that I've won a lot of games on the back of a single Insectile Aberration or Geist of Saint Traft

*The Other Guys*

- 4x Selesnya Charm
- 3x Call of the Conclave

I hate Call of the Conclave with every fiber of my being

Your second or third turn, Spell Rupture your Farseek if you're on the play, Unsummon the Lightning Mauler you dropped with Burning-Tree Emissary so that your Boros Elite trigger doesn't go off, etc.). Worst case scenario: you play nothing and I get to make a Vigilant 2/2 guy before I untap. It's not as great as the 3/3, but I was still able to make other plays if needed. You'll notice that my ideal play is not ""I spend two mana on my turn so that you can do whatever the hell you want on your turn."" Call of the Conclave is infuriating in that regard. I've struggled about finding more relevant, instant speed stuff to do, but more on that later.

*The Stuff*

- 4x Selesnya Charm
- 3x Simic Charm
- 3x Azorius Charm
- 2x Spell Rupture
- 2x Syncopate
- 2x Rootborn Defenses
- 1x Druid's Deliverance
- 1x Faith's Shield
- 1x Giant Growth

Selesnya Charm is the VIP in this deck. Every mode is relevant right now, or giving me an extra swinger. Simic Charm is also quite good. Mass hexproof is incredibly silly, and the other two modes provide wonderful versatility. Azorius Charm is something I added on my own. I didn't like that this deck had no draw power. Having a cycling card that I can also use to get something out of the way is too valuable to ignore.

The 2/2 split on Spell Rupture and Syncopate is something that keeps me up at night. Naturally

Rootborn Defenses and Druid's Deliverance are *so incredibly good.* At worst, I'm keeping my Geist alive and then dropping in a 4/4 Flying blocker. And then I'm going to untap and run your over.

I've even gotten to Druid's Deliverance on a 'Hoof swing

Giant Growth is nice, of course. Faith's Shield is the weakest card, I think. I've used it to great success, but it just doesn't feel good enough. The 1-of was an experiment, and I'm not thrilled with my results.

________________________________________________

**PTQ-ing**

4-3 isn't setting the world on fire. Allow me to qualify why I'm not dissatisfied with this in a mini-tournament report. 

**Round 1 - Fognidoor - 2-0**

I hadn't expected the match-up, but I managed to defeat the deck quite handily

**Round 2 - Barely Boros - 2-1**

I lost Game 1 to double Boros Reckoner and Hellrider. It was about as explosive a start as the deck could've accomplished. After sideboards

**Round 3 - Esper Control (Shaheen Soorani) - 1-2**

Going in, and, frankly, there aren't many people I'd rather have played. He was incredibly friendly and we played an enjoyable round of Magic. He had a very slow start in Game 1, and I managed to drop him to 4...and then I started picking up lands. When I ran out of gas, he was able to accelerate and turn the game around. I took Game 2 very handily thanks to Syncopate on Lingering Souls and Rootborn Defenses the following turn. Game 3 was just a blow-out. I picked up my opening seven and saw two Loxodon Smiter, two Selesnya Charm, especially since he dropped a turn three Liliana of the Veil. Instead, sadly

I was happy to play such a competent Esper player. Game 2 went so much better than I imagined and showed me that this deck can actually stand up to Esper.

**Round 4 - Prime Speaker Bant - 0-2**

I could not have lost this round any more spectacularly if I tried. I stuck threats early in both games, Prime Speaker Bant is hands-down the toughest one (I imagine any sort of Big Naya/Wolf-Run Bant lists could also be problematic, but I haven't seen much of them lately). 

**Round 5 - Red Deck Wins - 0-2**

This is where the wheels fell off. Disclaimer: I have a horrible habit of being unable to sleep the night before big Magic events. The night before the PTQ, a late start and a GPS screw-up prevented any such effort. After my round with Shaheen, I started to feel just terrible. I took the loss from Shaheen in stride and resolved to press on, but I just couldn't keep my damn eyes open. 

I was basically non-functional at this point. I let my opponent Searing Spear an Insectile Aberration while I had a Giant Growth in-hand

Since our game ended so briefly, baby, I had a stew goin'.

**Round 6 - UWR - 2-1**

I also pegged this as an abysmal match-up, Sunpetal Grove, Snapcaster Mage, Selesnya Charm. I picked up blue source on my third turn but decided to scoop so that my opponent had no idea how to sideboard (at that point, he had seen only two Green/White lands). On the other hand, I had seen a Thought Scour, and whatever that milled, so, my opponent had to completely change his sideboard. Game 3 was just oppressive: T1 Delver, followed by a Rootborn Defenses to effectively counter a Supreme Verdict to get me the win. 

**Round 7 - Jund Vampire/Zombie Aggro - 2-0**

Azorius Charm ripped this deck apart.

1365870076.0,1c9vph,[Standard] Changes in Junk Rites,Melonbomb,26,3,31,"So I've been playing Junk Rites for a while now and after constant tinkering

What I want to do is continue refining my deck for the WMCQ in DC so that I'm a bit more prepared. To do this

**No Lingering Souls:**
There are a couple reasons for this one really: First against aggro it really doesn't help you all that much. Aggro with green will Wolf Run/Rancor/Ghor-Clan through the puny 1 toughness and Electrickery/Thundermaw makes it miserable. I have never been in a situation where the tokens have been especially good, but that's usually fine as it is anyway or to block Falkenrath Aristocrat. The problem I see with Lingering Souls against Act 2 is that you're effectively giving them 2-4 more mana for Blasphemous Act and 2-4 more drain triggers off Artist. Maybe I'm really missing something here, but Lingering Souls  just hasn't ever been relevant for me.

**Loxodon Smiters over Centaur Healers/Lotleth Troll:**
I've tried Lotleth Troll and I've just been really disappointed with him. He seems like a good fit, but that's not really as much of a problem for Junk, you need more against Aggro. Lotleth Troll is just not the defensive card we need. I was enamored with Healer for a while, thinking that 6 points of life/toughness was better than 4 but 3 toughness means you'll trade/lose against most aggro creatures or just get Speared and then smashed. Loxodon at least offers a 2-for-1 on most of those combats or trades with cards just out of reach of what Centaur Healer could deal with. He either makes them take unfavorable trades/card disadvantage or pseudo fogs. He also is a bit better against Hexproof decks that counter anything that gets in the way of Traft or some tempo lists.

**Acidic Slime in the Main:**
This has just been TOO GOOD. Reanimating/Restoration Angel-ing Slime has just shut off so many decks and deathtouch lets us trade well. Its probably the best against control decks

**2 Caverns Main:**
One of the easiest ways for decks to disrupt this is dissipate/syncopate. Against Prime Speaker

**SB Choices:**

**Diving Reckoning:**
Sever the Bloodline has been really bad for me. Against Aristocrats, Reckoners, Blood Artists, Paladins...everything except Falkenrath and maybe an errant spirit token and that's fine. You also get value as you might have destroyed a Thrag and have a 3/3 in addition to whatever you saved. Its also great against Blitz where they overextend so much and even if they're left with their best guy, blocking one is much easier especially when you have a blocker as well.

EDIT: Link and stuff

**Liliana:**
I'm kinda sad that I have her to be honest

**Garruk:**
Beats the tar out of the mirror because smacking their mana dorks is good. Smack a dork

Against Junk Rites its really good at denying them mana to do things which is really what the matchup is about. Control has a hard time dealing with losing their Drownyards/mana for bigger X's for Revelation and sometimes I can keep them off double blue or white. What I really need to do is improve the aggro matchup because that's been really difficult for me lately. Of course

So Jund has me down. I love the archetype. I wanted something new and exciting. Now I’m not Reid Duke, so I know I’m not going to personally break the format. But there has to be something that will throw my FNM, Open, GP, PTQ, or IQ opponents for a loop. Anything is worth a try. 

I asked myself what I wanted. I want a sweeper! I want a reset button. But I want more than “destroy”. A light bulb went off; I grabbed my trade binder and found it. Merciless Eviction. Six mana? Well that’s a Mizzium overloaded. That’s a bonfire for 2.5. Six isn’t too much. It only asks for one white mana. 

Now let’s take a look at its other uses: Choose one — Exile all artifacts; or exile all creatures; or exile all enchantments; or exile all planeswalkers. Assemble the Legion? Witchbane Orb? any Planeswalker? Gone Exile all the creatures. 

I started testing. I love it. Bear in mind, Swamp, Blood Crypt, and Stomping Ground for x2 Temple Garden and x2 Godless Shrine, still have to cast Garruk at triple green. Jund plays minimal creatures. I prefer Vampire Nighthawk over Arbor Elf at the moment. If I drop a Nighthawk which either trades, deters, or gains some life and gets me to 6 mana, then no reason to sweep just yet. And i'm fine with casting a Thragtusk

Round 1 (1-2) - R/B Burn

I went in thinking this matchup would be heavily favoured in my opponents favour, this cost me the game) by attacking before I cast it, so that was dumb.  Then I made the further mistake of deciding to counter his threats rather than let them go through and get off a big revelation that would've surely given me the steam I needed to close it out.  Round goes to him purely through my own misplays.  Lesson learned, but I feel like with tighter play this isn't actually a bad matchup, and this persons deck consistently top 8s events so that actually gives me confidence about the deck.


Round 2 (2-0) - Tron

Game 1 he was focusing on dropping wurmcoils which I kept pathing, and got in with clique and colonnade for lethal.  Game 2 I saw an opening hand with two mana and a stony silence, snap keep, shut down his entire hand, colonnades finished the job.


Round 3 (2-0) - Jund

First Jund of the day, he attacked his own life total with lands, thoughtseizes, and bobs, while I kept him off his threats and finished with a clique and a lightning bolt.  Game 2 went more or less the same way.  I feel like any jund variant is a fantastic matchup for this deck since it has enough removals/counters to keep them off their threats for the first 5-6 turns until their hand depletes and you can get off a revelation or two, it's pretty tough to come back from that.


Round 4 (2-0) - Fish

Fish, being able to keep them off their creatures is devastating for them, their creatures don't have any kind of evasion, so one for oneing their threats and finishing off with batterskull/colonnades/cliques is very efficient here.  Game 2 was only strengthened by verdicts.


Round 5 - Draw into top 8


Round 6 (2-0) - Junk/Jund

This was a Junk variant on Jund running Wilt Leaf Lieges and Loxodon Smiters , clique, and electrolyze to the face.


Top 4 split.


A major competitor at the event were the eggs decks, and apparently these things were going off on turn 3 consistently.  This event was a qualifier so I'm going to start packing more graveyard hate vis a vis relic of progenitus for the main event next week.

I feel pretty happy with the deck.  Originally I was playing two cryptics because I only have two and was ready to buy two more, so I'm going to stick with two.

All stars today were path, and revelation.  Revelation is an interesting topic because as it began to be played in modern in the UW decks, people often remarked that it's too slow for the format.  In this deck I think it really shines though.  Basically the premise of the deck is to 1 for 1 your opponent until about turn 5, then your opponent may begin to run out of steam and you can start aggressively think twicing to make land drops up to 6-7, then you can revelate for a large number to stabilize your life total, and at that point you should have enough mana and cards in hand to keep your opponent completely locked down.  It's not uncommon to sneak a clique in end of turn and then burn your opponent out for another 3-6.

Changes moving forward, and I maybe consider going up to 3 revelations in the main.

However, there are a few new tools being brought to the game for our use. Granted, there don't seem to be any truly standout cards for this archetype, but decks like B/R zombies and RDW should be still be a force to be Reckoned with (Ha ha, LSV puns.) after their potential upgrades.

Because most of you are familiar with the staples of the various types

**Skull Crack** - Seems like an obvious sideboard because of the current love standard has for Thragtusk. Main board is a bit risky

**Legion Loyalist** - Scary 1 drop

**Boros Reckoner** - The card everyone seems to be hyping as a new potential 3 drop in many decks. He is powerful, he's essentially a mono-red card, which can be a difficult cost to pay in many situations

**Burning-Tree Emissary** - A very interesting two drop that may open up potential combos as the meta evolves. One commonly theorycrafted one is to play it and then a Lightning Mauler to swing for 4 on turn 2. Still

Personally, while the bulk of B/R zombies will remain the same, I expect to see many decks packing 3 or 4 Skullcracks in the side board just to deal with new threats.

I've tested a bit online, but it's really unsure to say what will happen so far seeing as the set is still new. I also tested a Chavest aggro that was essentially regular B/R aggro with Aurelia's Fury, Knight of Glory and Boros Charm splashed. Boros Charm is just as good as they say, and Knight of Glory provided interesting ultility in matches against other B/R aggro, but Aurelia's seems far too slow for aggro, and even then not beneficial enough for the deck type.

Obzedat seems like he'll pose a big problem

So since RtR has been spoiled, UWR Miracles has made quite a show, but some people (such as myself) have shown their disdain for miracles. If you're like me, you don't like having to get a perfectly-timed topdeck of Entreat the Angels to win, or you don't like having to rely on lucky Termini to win against Zombies. So, I went ahead and made a much more draw-go style of UWR Control: 

http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/deck.asp?deck_id=1049876

The idea is that cards like Lingering Souls, and with four Syncopates, Jace becomes a lot worse in our list. Also, with such little creatures, running Niv-Mizzet or Angel of Serenity as a win condition becomes a bit flimsy, since all of your opponent's kill spells have been sitting in their hand the entire game. Tamiyo avoids all of that, and she wins the game just as well. The primary way of winning is to ultimate her and then Pillar of Flame them to death.

Before States, but happy to see all the odd brews people were playing. My tournament went as follows:

Round 1: UWR Miracles. Game one he got stuck on two land on the play for the first 5 turns of the game, but Geist got there pretty quickly.

Round 2: UW Miracles. This one was pretty interesting. I lost a long game one due to some play mistakes, so when he played his own Geist I couldn't Dissipate it. I didn't draw another threat for a very long time, but we both drew plenty of land, and we eventually went to time after about 12 turns of each of us going land-go.

Round 3: Junk. This guy went on to come in 2nd, and I lost after 3 back-to-back Thragtusks. Game two I got a hand with 3 UW lands and a grip full of red spells that I knew were great against him, so I decided to gamble. I lost.

Round 4: UWR Miracles against a well-known friend of mine. This was a very interesting match. Normally going turn-two Snapcaster for beats is very bad in this matchup since I'm a lot more controlling than he is so he should be the beat-down, and he couldn't answer them.

Round 5: Rainbow Reanimator. A turn two Grisly Salvage from him showed me what deck he was playing, and with 6 mainboard exiling counterspells, I could deal with his bombs and Unburial Rites very well. I was unfortunately fairly unlucky. Game one, after the aforementioned Grisly Salvage, he plays a turn 5 Thragtusk, which I'm forced to counter. He casts Unburial Rites targeting a Griselbrand in his yard, which I had to counter. He then casts another Rites, and by turn 5 I had cast and flashed back two Desperate Ravings and been as unlucky to discard all my spells and draw all lands. My opponent Slaughter Games'd me on his turn 6

Round 6: At this point, so I knew he was playing Bant Control. After a 37 minute long game one, which involved us both being down to 6 cards in our deck, he plays the last threat in his entire deck, a Thragtusk, while I'm at 3 life and he's at a ton, but he would mill out first.

1345689712.0,yoat9,Control in Standard [Lists Inside],fjdkslan,26,7,46,"Hi all!

So if you're like me, but what I can tell you is that if you are a Spike who is legitimately good at this game, Control will often give you the most tools to work with to utilize your skills. This is not to say that Control takes more thought or skill than Aggro. Rather, the options given to Control players often allow more lines of play over a longer game, rather than trying to find the most efficient and effective way to win with one single line of play. For this reason, I am particularly fond of piloting Control decks. 

If you have been keeping up on some of Wizards' development team and their opinion on Spells vs Creatures in modern Magic, while sitting on Counterspell for four turns in a row not doing anything seems counterproductive to a newer player. 

As a result of R&amp;D's current outlook on spells vs creatures, is, well, Mana Leak, and is by design sometimes unreliable. That doesn't mean that control is dead though! So, without further ado, I present to you some of the control decks that I think can be good in this format.

[First up is Esper Control.](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/deck.asp?deck_id=1033604) This is a draw-go list that wins by stalling the game, Grave Titan, Batterskull, Nephalia Drownyard Mill, or Lingering Souls beatdown. Between Terminus, Forbidden Alchemy, and Curse of Death's Hold, to be very honest, ""Do I play Lingering Souls to absorb some damage

[This is Shaheen Soorani's Esper Superfriends list.](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/deck.asp?deck_id=1019903) It gives up counterspells completely in favor of board control through Planeswalkers and Lingering Souls. I can tell you that this list is very finely tuned, it is occasionally weak to Trading Post decks that have a ton of inevitability on you. This gets better after sideboard though, where Memoricide can rip the action out of the opponent's deck. Overall, this is close to my favorite list here. 

[Third, I don't particularly care for this list. Grixis has some great tools in the form of Pillar of Flame/Galvanic Blast, Whipflare, Bonfire, and Slagstorm, all of which are very good, but I don't particularly like the idea of Gilded Lotus into Fatty. The reason being, they don't do anything. There will be games where you draw all of your bombs and no ramp, this list is merely a placeholder. If any of you have an alternative list

[Finally, it may look like a Midrange deck, or even a slow Aggro deck, but this deck is definitely Control. It simply controls differently. Here's how: First, Elvish Visionary acts as the Think Twice of this deck. It immediately draws you a card, and then it can do one of a few things. It can either chump to gain you life, trade with a smaller creature and give you card advantage, or it can be blinked with Restoration Angel for value. Blade Splicer is another great control card in this deck. It is a brickwall for many of the aggressive decks in the format, or gains you life and a beast. Not to mention, it's very hard to lose. Other supporting cards of the deck are pretty self explanatory. If you think this deck is interesting

For reference

Afew quick things about his standard romp at the open:

- He never played Jund during swiss.  He split his matches against Jund in the top 8. 

- The games he won against Jund were on the backs of poor draws and mulligans on the Jund player's part.  It was obvious he was poorly matched.

- He had very good draws during the finals.  He played Kalonian Hydra on turns 3 and 4.  A seemingly unlosable play.  Wrong. They we're both removed at instant speed via doom blade and putrefy.

 

Now it seems to me the issue is that Huey commited 100 percent to the beatdown plan.  This makes sense as it IS a big dumb green creature deck.  The issue is that not only are big dumb green creatures easily delt with

This brings me to my recommended changes to his decklist:

4 Arbor Elf

3 Avacyn's Pilgrim

4 Craterhoof Behemoth

4 Elvish Archdruid

4 Elvish Mystic

4 Elvish Visionary

3 Restoration Angel

3 Farseek

4 Thragtusk

Planeswalkers (5)

3 Garruk

2 Garruk

Lands (22)

10 Forest

4 Gavony Township

4 Sunpetal Grove

4 Temple Garden

Voice of Resurgence - This card is a hedge against removal as well as being a hate-bearing against UWr.  I realize that both decks run Pillar of Flame.  The way I see it is if I play a turn 1 dork they will pillar of flame the dork instead

 
 
Thragtusk-  A great clock that discourages spot removal.  If you can make Jund's removal less efficient you have bought yourself enough time to finish the game.  Against aggro he is the kind of stabilizing.  Without resto angel he isn't quite as good

Restoration Angel - Huge with thragtusk and elvish visionary.  A turn 4 flickered thragtusk is lights out against most decks.  I would love to hear suggestions on choosing between VoR and Resto Angel.


Now a few questions for r/spikes:

-Is the beatdown plan better than the resiliency plan?

-Is voice of resurgence even relevant in this meta?  Is pillar of flame too good?

-With Jund tuning itself to beat the mirror match

-Why do you think the pro's aren't playing thragtusk and restoration angel?

-Do you think that other colors are worth splashing for?  For example G/R for Kessig Wolf Run

Thanks for your input

My thoughts around this:

First of all, two cantrips (Brainstorm and Ponder), disruption (Stifle and Wasteland), and two colored mana sources and on a blind keep this is pretty solid.

* I feel that Wasteland is just a horrible play turn one
* Misty Rainforest and Scalding Tarn. Their play order is irrelevant
* I feel that cracking a fetchland to Brainstorm or Ponder blind is not a very good play.
* My dilemma here is whether I play Delver on turn one or hold up Stifle.

My arguments for turn one Delver:

* Delver can apply good pressure. We can immediately untap and Brainstorm to flip into Insectile Aberration as long as there are no shenanigans from our opponent (i.e. Bolt and Plow are what come to mind).

* If we hold up Stifle and our opponent just plays a non-fetchland

* Additionally

My arguments for holding up Stifle:

* We can disrupt their first turn fetchland if they have it.

* Even if they don't have action

http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/grixis-control-moc-rspikes-edit/  


I posted this in the winning wednesday thread yesterday but it has no responses

So i've been playing around with this grixis control list for a little more than a week now. (http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/grixis-control-moc/)  

Land (25)  
4x Blood Crypt  
1x Desolate Lighthouse  
2x Dragonskull Summit  
3x Drowned Catacomb  
4x Steam Vents  
4x Sulfur Falls  
3x Swamp  
4x Watery Grave  

Instant (10)  
3x Far / Away  
2x Forbidden Alchemy  
3x Think Twice  
2x Turn / Burn  

Creature (9)  
1x AEtherling  
2x Master of Cruelties  
1x Niv-Mizzet
2x Snapcaster Mage  
3x Vampire Nighthawk  

Sorcery (9)  
1x Devil's Play  
2x Dreadbore  
3x Mutilate  
3x Pillar of Flame  

Planeswalker (7)  
3x Chandra
2x Jace
2x Liliana of the Veil  

Sideboard (15)  
2x Appetite for Brains  
2x Augur of Bolas  
2x Counterflux  
1x Curse of Echoes  
2x Dreadbore  
1x Far / Away  
1x Negate  
1x Pillar of Flame  
1x Rolling Temblor  
2x Turn / Burn  

Essentially the deck has Master of Cruelties as it's primary wincon, the only one that has underperformed is surprisingly Aetherling. But i believe this is because i haven't faced a control deck yet.  

So far I have tested extensively it against:  

* RG/Naya Aggro - good matchup when RG doesn't have the nuts. board brings in 4th pillar

* Naya Midrange - difficult matchup. pre board without 4 dreadbores for hellkites/ reckoners. This matchup feels like it needs countermagic to win against things like selesnya charm

* Jund Midrange - difficult matchup. Garruk (either variant) is a problem unless i can kill them the turn he comes down. Though a sweet play has been using far/away or turn/burn in response to primal hunter's minus to prevent card draw and kill him at the same time. Variants still running Sire also really suck without an answer in hand.  

* Junk Aristocrats - Surprisingly okay matchup. Jace's +1 is very relevant here. Mutilate is very good also. Voice is still not a huge problem. Cartel Aristocrat is the best card that deck has against me though and not saving/having an answer for it usually is a loss though.  

TL;DR: I am looking for feedback on how to improve my midrange matchups, but it's plenty possible i'm missing something great. As a side note if any control players can comment on how they feel about facing my deck, as i have yet to test against esper/UWR.

I've been playing Act II for a while now. Just so we're all on the same page, featuring Blood Artist and the full set of Lingering Souls over cards like Champion of the Parish and Silverblade Paladin. The deck has gone through a ton of permutations, removing Skirsdag High Priests for Sorins, taking out Orzhov Charms and putting High Priests back in, taking out Sorins and putting in mainboard Obzedats, etc. However, a lot of the base is the same, however

4 Cartel Aristocrat

4 Falkenrath Aristocrat

4 Doomed Traveler

4 Blood Artist

4 Boros Reckoner

3 Blasphemous Act

4 Tragic Slip

4 Lingering Souls

4 Godless Shrine

4 Blood Crypt

4 Sacred Foundry

4 Isolated Chapel

4 Dragonskull Summit

1 Plains

You'll notice that there's 8 cards missing from the main deck. Five of them are nonlands

* Skirsdag High Priest

* Sorin

* Orzhov Charm

* Obzedat

* Sin Collector

Basically, the only real question is how greedy to get with the mana base. The most common lists will just run 1 Cavern, 1 Plains, and 1 Clifftop Retreat, but some are taking out either the Clifftop Retreat or the Plains for another Cavern or even a Vault of the Archangel.

The other question is, Assemble the Legions, Appetite for Brains/Duress, Electrickery, Zealous Conscripts, Intangible Virtue, additional Caverns/Blasphemous Acts/Sorins/Sin Collectors

**New Lists**

A few new lists have popped up such as the one running Aureila as a 2 of and Angel of Serenity in the Sideboard to recur all of your creatures or get rid of your opponents. I like this list as it can just end a game quickly by dropping the Aurelia. It recently took second place at SCG KC. But a recent deck has caught my eye. At the 2012 MTGO Championship there was a deck tech of a UWR Flash Variant that had Geist and Thundermaw mainboard like I had suggested in my other thread. [The Deck is called ThunderGeist](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sqmf2nPsVlE) it uses Feeling of dread to tap down opposing threats and can deal quick damage with geist of saint traft and end games using Thundermaw. The deck uses a lot of things I had thought up in my last thread and the main diffrences is that the deck is more aggro/control than what I was trying to come up with. I think this deck can end the game quickly before Junk or any other midrange deck that UWr Flash usually has problems with but is more vulnerable to aggro which was our better match up with Boros Reckoner.

What can we do to have better match ups against these decks? Or is it ""If we can't beat them

With the popularity of Junk Reaimator and how good the deck is what is going to bring this deck down?


**Our Match ups**

UWR against your average meta.

*Esper Control*

Esper isn't a bad match up for us with how much damage we can do and with things like Psychic Spiral and Harvest Pyre/Reckoner to battle the milling we can win out of nowhere against this deck.

*Aggro*

With cards like Reckoner and Augur of Bolas chump blocking we can usually survive long enough to either burn them out and put the game out of reach with cards like Sphinx's revelation.

*Naya/Jund(Midrange)*

Big Creatures with Trample and Life gain from Thragtusk really puts us behind and is hard to gain control of the game. Also hard to end the game. But this isn't a good or bad match up if you can play your cards right the game can swing in your favor and you can win the game.

*Reanimator*

With junk it's just hard to do anything they put down Thragtusk and Blink it with Resto and just puts the game way out of reach for us and down comes Craterhoof and that's usually game. Post board you'd bring in graveyard hate and they can just play through it

So overall we have good match ups against Aggro but decent against Midrange and horrible against Junk.

**Thoughts on the deck:**

* I played this because I wanted to play a midrange deck due to my expectation of the field (expected lots of aggro). I had yet to play the deck before the tournament so the list was a first go at building the deck. It is certainly rough. 
* This is like the Bant Midrange deck, the Warleader. I'm of the opinion that this change is definitely good- Zegana is sweet and draws you a bunch of cards, but Aurelia just kills them dead. 
* Only one card in the deck was actively bad- Aurelia's Fury. It rarely did anything amazing
* A lot of decks are cold to Assemble the Legion. It was much better in the main than in the board
* Domri Rade is excellent. Against control it's a three mana Garruk. I definitely want more of the card. 
* Don't play Boros Reckoner in three color decks. It's a good card
* The Gruul Keyrune is in the board because you want to side out mana dorks a reasonable amount of the time (they're bad vs any sort of wrath)
* Cards I feared included Olivia Voldaren and Planar Cleansing. The first you need a removal spell for. The second is a card fights any nonland trump against the control decks. Mortars was also annoying and made me realize that everything in the deck has four toughness.

Over the course of five rounds I played against a strange deck (it curved Invisible Stalker into High Priest of Thune into Intangible Virtue + Blind Obedience one game), a Naya aggro deck, and Human Reanimator.

The biggest concern is obviously the high CMC of the deck (3x Jace, and a Dark Confidant sticking makes the already impressive card advantage that this deck generates become obscene.

I think the card shines the most in control matchups (which Ben Stepka agrees with), It does, of course die to Abrupt Decay, but against a heavy controlling BUG deck, he improves the chances of a threat sticking, so having both SFM and Bob should be good as well.

I've recently been having the itch to throw myself into Legacy; I enjoy the fast, I like Fish, I find that the combination of obnoxious tempo/control and creature beats fits my style very well.  It's also very well positioned in both metas I play in and tends to always do fairly well, if never finishing first.

So my next question would be

I could easily put together a more fringe, Elves!, Belcher, or Reanimator, but I'm seriously hesitating on dropping the cash.  With the exception of Elves! there isn't much in either deck that can be reused for another deck later down the road.  

Fish allowed me the luxury of Vial, and Wasteland; all major staples I've already slid into various other comp. and casual decks when the need arises.

That being said, and I enjoy both tournaments and casual play and spend a good deal of time doing both.

What do the Spikes of Reddit suggest; do I throw together Goblins or do I start piecing together one of the many ""Good Stuff"" Legacy decks like Jund or Delver (There was a mono-blue rogue tempo deck that placed a while back I thought looked interesting...) knowing that it's about double what I'd be paying for Goblins or Elves, Goyf, Bob, etc)?

Or do you have any other Legacy deck suggestions that are fun and competitive?  I'm in the fishing for ideas phase right now

This card is Grapeshot. Link to Grapeshot: http://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/card/details.aspx?name=grapeshot

This is the deck that runs Grapeshot Storm: http://forums.mtgsalvation.com/showthread.php?t=399245
There are three decks considered to be Tier 1 competitive decks in Pauper - Blue Delver - http://forums.mtgsalvation.com/showthread.php?t=390528) - IzzetPost - http://forums.mtgsalvation.com/showthread.php?t=379000 - and Storm. The reason for there being only 3 decks is that the two non-Storm decks are the only decks that can potentially deal with Grapeshot Storm via counterspells. Every other deck can only hope that the Storm player has a bad draw or screws up their math. At any time from turn 3 on

Why is Grapeshot the issue and not also Empty the Warrens + Goblin Bushwhacker? Because aggro and midrange decks can actually sideboard in cards to combat the mass hasted tokens storm. White has cards like Suture Priest and Holy Light

So what does removing Grapeshot from the format do? It opens up the top tier of the format to decks that are not control decks, it can be a very frustrating experience (not that playing control mirrors is the most fun thing in the world either).

I also want to note that banning Grapeshot, and if they went first, the opponent will likely not have enough mana to board wipe them. I want to be clear I am not against combo decks in any way, but this combo is by itself shutting down the possibility of a great number of otherwise viable competitive decks.

The above reasons are why I feel like Grapeshot should be banned from the Pauper format.

1353432770.0,13incm,"[Standard] awjustaguy's complete guide to competitive Naya, with match-ups, sideboard reviews, and lots of notes.",awjustaguy,8, but I figured with the success I'm having that some variation of this will get out anyway

http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/who-let-the-zoo-out/

Feel free to ask me any questions about it and I'll explain some of the plays you can make.

**Why Naya?** It is no secret that Thragtusk + Restoration Angel is one of the most powerful combos in standard. Thragtusk has immense creature value as he is always a 2-for-1. I wanted to capitalize on the theme of creature value; if all of my creatures are a 2-for-1, and Zealous Conscripts was in-color too, which works wonderfully with Restoration Angel. White and Green are also low on decent removal. White has oblivion ring, green has prey upon and ulvenwald, so red filled up a weakness by providing burn spells.

**But awjustaguy, the solution is obvious and even synergistic - ramping. Mana ramping fixes the base and boosts us to midgame, which is where the deck shines naturally. Adding in 4x Avacyn's Pilgrim and 4x Farseek has eliminated nearly all mana screw. I can't remember any games in which I have lost due to a missing color. Evolving Wilds also makes a return in this deck, providing just the extra fixing necessary in emergency situations. We don't have many t1-t2 plays anyway so it hardly ever impedes my progress. A consequence of the color wedge, however, is that I do not recommend running any more than 2 colorless land. I have chosen to run Slayers' Stronghold as I think it is good in the meta, but Wolf Run and Township are perfectly viable options as well.

The point of this deck is simple; ramp to 4 land and abuse Restoration Angel and the most powerful 4-6 cc creatures in Standard.

A few notes: It's really important to know when to push and when to hold back with this deck. Just because you have a Thragtusk on the field and a restoration angel in your hand doesn't mean you should flicker him at the end of turn; it's best to save angel in response to enemy removal. Sideboarding can change this deck to be more aggressive for control matchups. With zealous conscripts, and ulvenwald tracker, you are capable of massive board-state changes in just one turn; use it to your advantage, and you can almost always catch opponents off-guard. Cavern of Souls should probably be included but we have such a variety of creature types that it can strain the manabase; I'll leave that up to you.

Cute combos: Grabbing a creature with Conscripts and then flickering it with angel gives you a shiny new creature. Grabbing a creature with conscripts and making it fight enemy creatures with Tracker gives you board domination.

Here's my explanation on the match ups against current competitive and the sideboard options.
__________________________________________________________

***Against RDW:*** One of our easier matchups. Once you get to 5 mana they are mostly helpless. Watch out for Thundermaw Hellkite; you want to save your oblivion rings / tracker for this guy as you have no other way to kill it. Often times you can even outrace the RDW player; make sure to watch for this and know when you can be aggressive as they won't expect you to go on the offense and will often times keep being aggressive anyway.

***Cards you want to see in your hand:*** Thragtusk, Pillar, Huntmaster, Centaur Healer, Loxodon Smiter, Oblivion Ring, Restoration Angel

***Sideboard:*** -2 Zealous Conscripts, -3 Avacyn's Pilgrim, +2 Mizzium Mortars, +3 Searing Spear, +3 Pillar of Flame, +3 Loxodon Smiter
__________________________________________________________

***Against U/W Flash:*** This is one of the harder matchups. This deck alone is a potential reason to put in 4 Cavern of Souls. You need to be as fast as possible against this deck because you have no way to answer Sphinx's Revelation. They won't be able to kill you very fast, azorius charm and unsummon become a little worse. Acidic Slime shuts down Moorland Haunt and can reduce their tempo if they don't get many lands. Huntmaster forces them to play cards when they don't want to; if you can get it out early do so. Ulvenwald Tracker is a star in this matchup- they often have few ways to remove him and his instant-speed removal bypasses counters. Severely reduces the effectiveness of Angel / Pike / Moorland.

***Cards to look for in your hand:*** Farseek, Oblivion Ring, Acidic Slime, Zealous Conscripts, Huntmaster of the Fells, Ulvenwald Tracker

***Note on Counters:*** Since I don't have a way to draw more cards, Thragtusk. Try to bait out their counters with removal or a more minor creature.

***Sideboard:*** -2 Mizzium Mortars, +4 Loxodon Smiter, +1 Acidic Slime
__________________________________________________________

***Against Jund:*** Jund is like our older brother. We're both midrange decks, and he will most likely eat up a removal spell if he doesn't, which is good for a one-drop. Just overwhelm them midgame with your superior forces and this will be a fairly easy matchup. Acidic Slime can take out wolf runs / Rakdos Keyrunes.

***Cards to look for in your hand:*** Armada Wurm, Restoration Angel, Huntmaster of the Fells, Ulvenwald Tracker, Mizzium Mortars.

***Sideboard:*** -3 Centaur Healer
__________________________________________________________

***Against Reanimator:*** This matchup isn't too bad. Your goal here is to do as much damage as you can before they get out their fatty, if you DO happen to get Angel'd, you get your ETB effects again. Matchup becomes much more favorable with RIP sideboarded in. NOTE: If you're playing the lingering souls/craterhoof reanimator combo, value Mizzium Mortars much more highly.

***Cards to look for in your hand:*** Thragtusk, Restoration Angel, Loxodon Smiter, Rest in Peace, Farseek

***Sideboard:*** -1 Searing Spear, -1 Centaur Healer, +4 Loxodon Smiter, +3 Rest in Peace
__________________________________________________________

***Against Bant Control:*** Every deck has a worst matchup, and we don't have many ways to deal with Planeswalkers. Thragtusk and Conscripts will be your best bet here, as well as getting out some early Loxodon Smiters. Make sure to save Conscripts for their planeswalkers; you can usually finish them off with their - ability.

***Cards to look for in hand:*** Loxodon Smiter, Thragtusk, Avacyn's Pilgrim.

***Sideboard:*** -2 Mizzium Mortars, +4 Loxodon Smiter
__________________________________________________________

***Against B/R Zombies:*** Another one of our easier matchups. This is the same principal as RDW: Get to 5 mana, along with centaur healer and Ulvenwald Tracker. Just as with RDW, look for times when their offense has slowed considerably or isn't very strong, and become the aggressor, it catches them off guard as they aren't used to defending.

***Cards to look for in hand:*** Same as RDW.

***Sideboard:*** Same as RDW.
__________________________________________________________

***Against G/W Aggro:*** G/W Aggro is a favorable match up but you have a few things to watch out for. Sigarda is impossible for us to kill without two resto angels, but not nearly so troublesome - just have a searing spear or an oblivion ring set aside. The important thing to remember in this matchup is A: The turn 3 silverblade paladin, and B: The turn 4/5 wolfir silverheart. If you are prepared to handle these threats (don't just count on them not getting them, they will most likely get them), then you will sail through this match up. If you aren't prepared, you will be caught with your pants down. Keep early burn in your hand to keep them out of the game until you can fight them on your own terms. Once you get an ulvenwald trackers and a beefy creature on the field, you can pretty much lock the game down

***Cards to look for in hand:*** Mizzium Mortars, Thragtusk, Oblivion Ring, Restoration Angel

***Sideboard:*** -2 Acidic Slime, +1 searing spear, +2 pillar of flame
__________________________________________________________

That's all for now. If you guys want advice on any other matchups I can give it.

***Conclusion:*** There is no doubt that this deck has some extreme power. Is it tier 1? After multiple first places in constructed tournaments, this deck has no place to go but up. I'm convinced that this will be the deck to watch out for in the next few months. I'll be glad to answer any more questions and give advice as requested.",,False,,t5_2utkz,1353471999.0,,

He was playing his most recent version of U/W draw-go (sorry can't find the link) with a scatterbrained sideboard that had 1 griffin in it. The matchup was some sort of Junk Midrange that looked really powerful. We saw Sorin LOI, Cavern, Lingering souls, probably Restoration Angel (though we didn't see it), mainboard Underworld connections, stuff like that. After going down game 1, Prosak decided to side in griffin for gigs and at the request of the stream because he figured there was no way he was winning.

Then game 2 happened and a turn 2 Rest in Peace was dropped. Prosak Thought scour'd himself

Game 3, he got a spirit and the griffin just came back. Chumping all day with haunt spirits plus griffin beats sealed the deal again and Prosak finished at an (what we thought was) unlikely 4-0 given that matchup of his draw-go deck versus T5-cavern-naming-beast-thragtusk-go deck.

Hey

Round 1 - Punishing Jund - Game 1: He started Grove into Deathrite and I responded with Grove into Bolt. The next turn he played Bob which I hit with a Fire. He passed after missing a land drop and I resolved a Library then Wasted him. The next turn he wasted me. It became very grindy until Library allowed me to pull ahead with Cascade. Game 2: Turn 1 I got Thoughtseized with a Hymn turn 2 and Lily Turn 3. Couldn't do much, Pithing Needle SB Out: 4 Force of Will (1-0)

Round 2 - Maverick (Jack Wang) - Game 1: All I saw this game was 2 Noble Heirarch. I started by destroying both with burn spells, Pithing Needle, Surgical Extraction SB Out: 4 Force of Will (2-0)

Round 3 - Landstall - Game 1: I wasn't very sure what I was going against as I'm relatively new to Legacy and the only card he cast was Crucible of Worlds. I was able to land a Turn 2 Domri Rade and ultimate him uninterrupted. Game 2: Again

Round 4 - RUG Delver (Chris Pikula) - Game 1 - I saw the absolute worst things as an opponent of this deck. He was on the play and Stifled my first fetch. I had a Grove of Burnwillows into Deathrite. He followed up with Forked Bolt into Wasteland. After he resolved double Mongoose and Goyf it was more than over. Game 2 - I tried to Mull into a hand that was too vulnerable, Sylvan Library, BBE (3-1)

Round 5 - RUG Delver (Featured but off camera) - Game 1: He only hit one land but it was pretty awesome in the Delver point of view. He burned me down to 1 as I established a small board presence and he luckily wasn't able to hit anything as I ran into BBE and cascaded away. Game 2: Same old stuff with this deck. Played a fetch and passed and I did the same. He played a Dual and dropped a Mongoose. I had to try and crack the fetch but a Stifle was waiting in the wings. I crushed very hard. Game 3: I got to play the Delver game myself with a 5 land opening land. I was able to crack for an island and suspend Visions. His turn was a Ponder which I was very happy with. I Wasted him and passed. I was able to Waste every land he played and grow my board presence with Cascade. SB In: 2 Grim Lavamancer, BBE (4-1)

Round 6 - 4c Loam (Hoogland's list) - Game 1: He went land, but him mulling to 5 was a pretty big help. I made myself Waste-proof and got to Shardless turn 2 and BBE turn 3. Game 3 he started by going to 6 and with a cycle land tapped, I then suspended a Visions turn 1. He was only able to drop Mox and Wish for a Loam. I played a land and Grudged his Mox. At the end of his draw step I Surgically Extracted his Wasteland that he pitched with Mox. He actually drew one that turn so he had no lands in hand and no Wastelands. The win was pretty easy after that. SB In: 2 Ancient Grudge, 3 Surgical Extraction, Pithing Needle SB Out: 3 Punishing Fire, Misdirection, Domri Rade

Game 7 - Countertop - Game 1: These decks go a little silly against Cascade with all the triggers. Game 1 I was able to keep bashing in enough threats through the top thanks to Cascade. Game 2 I got crushed pretty badly, Maelstrom Pulse SB Out: 3 Punishing Fire (6-1)

Game 8 - I was the 4th seed

Top 8 - Reanimator - So this was the match some of you might have seen. I'm sorry that I couldn't show how the deck worked -_- Game 1 he was on the play, but in case you didn't know Angel of Despair &gt; Elesh Norn. On to game 3. I had to Mull again and didn't get anything better. I had a FoW and was hoping to hit a blue card. This game was my Goyf racing his Griselbrand, which was actually way closer than many people thought it's be due to his liberal use of Griselbrand. 

So my first tournament with more than 14 people using that deck and overall I was very impressed with it. Thanks for reading and sorry if this wasn't as informative as it could be. I have to get better with notes as I'm playing.

1372042106.0,1gy139,[Standard] Madcap Skills vs. Firefist Striker vs. Lightning Mauler in RG Aggro [Discussion],highchaz,20,4,41,"The most recent RG Aggro list to [Top 8 at SCG](http://www.mtgtop8.com/event?e=5132&amp;d=229589) had 4 Mainboard Madcap Skills

This got me thinking

Now, I think it may be the way to go. It's not much different than running Firefist Striker, honestly, allowing your suited up creature to get through while your others are being blocked, or, your other creatures are getting through while you are making your opponent block a 5/2 Stromkirk, losing 2 creatures in the process most of the time.

The possibility of going turn 1 Noble, Madcap on Noble is so explosive. As you are hitting for 4 on your first swing. And, on the play or on the draw, that 4 damage is getting through regardless, or they are losing 2 creatures. As I said, this leaves us open for 2-for-1's, but, the targeted removal would simply go to him first anyways

And if you can happen to land a Madcap on Reckoner

Now, as I'm likely choosing to run Mauler over removal or Ghor Clan in some combination. Intial thoughts were: +3 Mauler, -1 Rampager -2 Searing Spear. This makes us quicker, but less resilient. 

I've even considered a straight creature build: -4 Pillar -4 Searing Spear

But

So

Here is the decklist: http://www.starcitygames.com/article/26243_The-Industry-Standard-Burn-Those-Burning-Trees-6th-1st.html

Now onto the report!

Round 1: Jund run by Greg Smith

Game one I start off with a shaky that consisted of a few lands

1-0

Sided in 3 skullcracks and 1 mizzium

Round 2: UWR Control run by Tyler Mollenkopf

Game one he has got the pillar of flame snapcaster hand which proceeds to shut down my deck and ends up finishing it with an uncontested Aetherling.  Game two I am able to keep landing threats faster than he can take them out

2-0

Sided in 2 Boros Charms and 3 Skullcracks while taking out 2 rancors and 3 Searing Spears.

Round 3 UWR Control run by Edward Fox

Edwards deck seemed a bit wonky

3-0

Round 4: Esper Control run by my buddy Raymond Perez Jr.

I played against Raymond at a 5k the weekend before when he was on Grixis and I was on just RG.  I was able to pull of the win but I knew he was an insanely good player.  I lost both games because he was able to ration of his removal consisting of warped physique and Far//Away over the course of the game and wasn't afraid to one for one his supreme verdicts. I can't remember what he played that killed me but I know it wasn't Obzedat or Blood Baron of Vizkopa.

3-1

I sided in 2 boros charms as well as 3 skull cracks

Round 5-7 Bant Hexproof run by William Dickey

I had yet to have played against Bant Hexproof with this deck so I was nervous playing the first one.  Then I realized that this deck stomps Hexproof.  It can race just as fast as long as they don't get an unflinching courage online.  The key cards in this matchup is being able to swing and do the Ghor-clan/Boros Charm combo to blow them out of the water.  I lumped them all together because the games played out the same way.  All went to game 3

6-1 in top 8!

Top 8: Bant Hexproof yet again.

Top 4: Also Bant Hexproof!

I wish I could write about these matchups but they all ran the same way

I ended up splitting Top 2 with a guy running 4 color reanimator however we played it out for the plaque.  

Game one I had a steady stream of creatures while he was trying to hit some big stuff in his yard.  Turn 6 I cast my voice of resurgence and have enough mana to cast Reckoner as well


All in all I am very happy with how well this deck did.  Over the course of the weekend it went 13-5 in matches which is awesome for a first run.

1369070394.0,1epdi0,[Modern] Underplayed or Unplayed cards that you think have potential.,AlasPoorOstrava,24,7,102,"Hey spikes

Some cards just have potential, or maybe the meta is just currently too punishing against it.  Whatever the reason, I think it's important to be aware of and remember these cards when deck tuning.  You never know when a new set or ban could suddenly spring them into relevance.  

Let's share some cards that you think could have potential in the future.

Here are a few of mine

1) **Blade Splicer** - This thing was a beating in standard, and loves flicker effects.  I think it saw a bit of play in a modern UW Caw-Blade variant, but otherwise fell off the map pretty quickly.

http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=233068

2) **Devout Lightcaster** - Triple white means this would need a very particular deck to work, Olivia, Deathrite, etc.  Most likely sideboard hate, but I like this card a lot.

http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=191374

3) **Paladin en-Vec** - Auriok Champion has started seeing some play because its pro-red / pro-black makes it a very pesky creature to deal with.  The Paladin loses the life text from Champion

http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=129668

4) **Sedraxis Specter** - Okay this one is a bit pie in the sky, I think this guy would be very wicked in a Grixis tempo shell, if that ever gets the cards to become a thing.

1368641777.0,1eeaqz,[Standard] U/W/x,Apertural,20,2,50,"So with Dragon's Maze out and available online I have taken curiosity to see where U/W/x decks would go in the format and a few variation of the deck have popped up on Daily events and Premiers. I would like to stay with U/W/x  as a deck and I feel like it can adapt to the format fairly well. Ætherling has been an addition in some UWR decks and I like this and have yet to try it but 2 lists have struck my attention.

**The New and not so new Decks**

[UW Flash/Control](http://www.mtgtop8.com/event?e=4941&amp;d=228539)

This deck recently took 4th in a MTGO Premier event and I was surprised to see it there. With counters

[UWR Reckoner/Aurelia](http://www.mtgtop8.com/event?e=4932)

1st place in premier. This deck uses both Aurelia and Reckoner where before it was one or the other. The deck can handle aggro better with reckoner and still end games with Aurelia. There are a lot of burn spells they have avalible that I think can be done better Warleader's Helix comes to mind. But the deck also uses Ral Zarek as a 2 of I like him here he acts as burn to get rid of opposing creatures and can ramp you into an Aurelia quicker. I think the board and some of the burn can be worked on but I like where this deck is going.

I like the creature base of UWR with:

* 2 Aurelia
* 3 Boros Reckoner
* 3 Restoration Angel
* 3 Snapcaster Mage
* 2 Augur of Bolas(Deputy could be good here also.)

I think this base could work well as an answer to aggro and be good against the Midrage decks like how the Aurelia list is.

I've been pondering an idea of a Midrange UWR deck that uses Lavina and other UWR staple creatures with draw spells burn and other cards but haven't been able to finalize a list. I feel like UWR with a good board presence could be good instead of Flash. Also Aurelia's Fury and Legion's Initiative

**Some Cards in Mind**

I've been thinking of some cards to add to UWR are:

* Aurelia's Fury
* Renounce The Guilds
* Legion's Initiative
* Lavinia of The Tenth
* Warleader's Helix
* Turn // Burn
* Ætherling
* Ral Zarek
* Niv-Mizzet

I think some of these could find a home in UWR in a Midrage kind of deck With Lavinia tapping down creatures and letting you swing in for more damage then keeping things tapped down with Aurelia's fury letting them play no spells on there turn and with counters and burn to deal with things creatures that we don't want to see.

There's a few choices I've made that I should go over:
  
* AEtherling as a finisher over Aurelia. This card's been under a lot of dispute
* No Boros Reckoners in the 75. I really do like Reckoner, and he makes my board wipes much trickier to cast. Also, I don't have the room to run things that combo well with Reckoner like Boros Charm (infinite life combo) and Harvest Pyre.
* Jace, and the mill 10 is an occasional game breaker.
* Tamiyo, I don't know what to bring her in aganist. She seems pretty good against every matchup (except that she's too slow to handle aggro), so I thought she might be good in the mainboard.
* Ral Zarek. I've been testing him and I've liked him so far. At worst, he stays online and keeps giving me tempo advantage. I would like to run two of him, but the list is tight, and I'm not sure where I could fit him in.
* 2 Warleader's Helix. Seems strong, Restos, and a strong aggro dampener with the lifegain.
* 2 Turn // Burn. I think this is the right number
* No Pillars mainboard. I am worried about Voice and/or Aristocrats, Aurelia's Fury).
* Aurelia's Fury. I've been testing with 2 Furies mainboard, I cut it to 1 main 1 side. It costed too much mana anyway.

This is my first report so I guess I'll just jump right into it!

**Round 1** - Andy with R/B Goblins

Game 1 - My opponent keeps a slow hand on the play (no lacky) and just gets picked apart by thought seizes and goyfs

Game 2 - My opponent opens up with an Aether Vial on the play into 3 goblin lackys on turn 2 vs my Death rite shaman into turn 2 Engineered Plague. The game ends about 7 turns later with myself having 10 more permanents in play and 3 more cards in hand.

1-0

**Round 2** - Scott with Merfolk

Game 1 - my opponent floods out a little and lilliana is able to close the game out with some goyfs for pressure

Game 2 - we both mulligan down to 5 and my hand of bob, delta, underground sea beats his 1 island, 3 lord, Spellskite opener

2-0

**Round 3** - David with Sneak and Show

Game 1 - I recognize my opponent from the legacy challenge the night before and know hes on Sneak and Show and mulligan accordingly. Naturally this means I go down to 4. The game ends several turns later with him dead on board peeling a spaghetti monster for the win.

Game 2 - Once again I mulligan down to 5 with him keeping 7. This was an interesting game that ended with me sacrificing 6 permanents and exiling one of my creatures sacrificed with a Deathrite shaman to go to 16 before getting hit for 15. I put him on not having another creature and cast dimir charm to look at the top of his library which was met with a force of will and then a concession after he draws a fetch land starring down a lethal goyf.

Game 3 - I keep a 6 card hand with a little disruption and get blown out by the turn 2 show and tell with force back up.

2-1

**Round 4** - Matt with Jund

Game 1 - I get a little bit flooded and scoop to my opponent after he only sees daze

Game 2 - My wish comes true after all his removal is boarded out and my goyf is met with a look of suprise. The dream is short lived how ever by having 4 spells and 12 lands by the end of the game. 

2-2

**Round 5** - Andy with Sneak and Show

Game 1 - Andy goes for the blind turn 1 on the play and I promptly scoop em up and go to side boarding

Games 2 and 3 where both pretty one sided as he just couldn't recover from Bob feeding me cards and promptly shredding his hand.

3-2

**Round 6** - Jeremy with Oops all spells 

Game 1 - My opponent is on the play and has the turn 1 so we go to side boarding

Game 2 - I have a turn 1 thought seize followed up by a daze and a goyf and my opponent concedes

Game 3 - My opponent keeps a speculative hand with 3 cyclers on the play and misses the turn 1. His hand gets picked apart and he is unable to recover.

4-2

**Round 7** - Sam Black with B/W Humans

I had heard rumors throughout the day that Sam had a spicy new brew he was playing but that was about all I knew going into game 1.

Game 1 - I'm on the play with a bob and few wastelands and land a Jace vs his empty board. Sam sees the writing on the wall and scoops em up.

Game 2 - We have a very strange game that eventually ends with Sam winning. After seeing some more of his deck I go back to my sideboard and bring in my Engineered Plagues.

Game 3 - I open up on the play with a Thoughtseize and take Sam's only non-human card in hand (Stoneforge mystic) and promptly slam an E Plague on turn 3 which gets a concession. 

5-2

**Round 8** - Michael with Merfolk

Much like Show and tell Merfolk was everywhere this past weekend. I don't remember the last time I hit it twice in the swiss but it has proven to be a decent match up so I didn't complain.

Game 1 - I keep a removal light hand in the dark and get run over.

Game 2 - I use my life as a resource and get my opponent to over extend a little bit then clean up the board with an EE on 2 and he is unable to recover.

Game 3 - We have a VERY grindy game 3 which easily went 20 turns. My opponent's inexperience with the deck started showing as we entered the late game and I was able to pull it out at 1 life. 

6-2

**Round 9** - Jason with Sneak and Show

Game 1 - My turn 1 Thoughtseize gets misdirected and I immediately know my opponent is on Show and Tell. After beating the deck twice in the Legacy challenge and once before (nearly twice) in the swiss I feel very confidant (buh dum tiss) going into this round. I squeak out game 1 with the help of Mr. Maher and some Thoughtseizes.

Game 2 - My opener had some disruption but a mediocre clock so my opponent was able to recover and come back for the win. 

Game 3 - My opponent mulligans to 5 on the draw and isn't able to recover from a Thoughtseize taking his only action and a hymn and some pressure to follow it up.

In Sealed I've found that playing your best cards still largely takes precedence over everything else

So it's a fast format, Crocanura, Kingpin's Pet, Basilica Screecher are the backbones of decks in this format and yet people consistently pick higher cost creatures / removal over them. 

While I understand the removal preference for the guilds with black

So there's my question to you guys

Initial thoughts on the list:

1. Land count is low. It's usually not a problem but I've had hairy situations arise where I want more lands and am just not drawing them. I'd like to raise the land count by at least one (Gavony Township probably)

2. I'm not a huge fan of Avacyn's Pilgrim. There are very few three drops I want to ramp into on turn 2 (Medic/Paladin and neither is mandatory). I want a one drop that applies pressure

3. Potential replacements are really only one: Experiment One. He's a human, he would synergize with the addition of a Township. The cons are obvious - we need to up mana sources and he's a mediocre to poor late game top deck. He also competes with the Champ for the one drop spot (though he probably beats champ since champ triggers off ANY human, whereas Experiment only triggers off bigger humans). 

4. Nearthearth Pilgrim is good but only in an aggro heavy format. Slower formats make him mediocre to bad and I think I'd dump him to the sideboard to up my land count and add more action to the main deck. Meta-dependent call.

5. Selesnya Charm isn't great in a slower format. The things it hits in G1 rarely merits its place in the MD. I think it's a better board card. Evasion is given by wolf run and 9/10 I'd rather top deck a spear or a boros charm. 


So

Finally

Another option for ramping up the clock is replacing Neartheath w/ Burning Tree Emissary - which isn't a bad idea save for the fact that its ability isn't terribly relevant in a white heavy deck unless you play her T4 to get her and a huntmaster.

I think the changes I'd make would be as follows:

-2 Avacyn's Pilgrim

-3 Nearheath Pilgrim

-2 Selesnya Charm

+4 Experiment One

+2 Boros Charm

+1 Gavony Township

1356284387.0,15bzh8,[Standard] Choosing a deck for GP Atlantic City,VideSupra,25,8,31,"Hey fellow spikes

So I'm trying to decide what deck to bring to GP AC. I last played a competitive tourny at SCG Baltimore with UW Flash and got completely smoked. It was a terrible meta call (needed red for removal) and an overall bad results day but one that gave me lots of good experience.

Now

1. UWR Control (Flash)
2. Angel Reanimator (GP Nagoya winner)

My question to you is what do you think the meta will look like? I think Angel Reanimator has a great matchup against almost everything - the real question is dealing with hate. Rest in Peace and Grafdigger's Cage can wreck that deck very effectively games 2 and 3 in a way Ray of Revelation may be insufficient to deal with.

I'm comfortable with UWR control but I feel like I still don't have a fantastic matchup against aggro, I have a creeping hunch that it will be a bad meta call due to its recent success (everyone will be packing hate) and its luck-of-the-draw matchups v. hyper aggressive decks.

I love playing Angel combo and am leaning towards running it but I'm really worried about hate. Do you think many people will be packing GY hate? I assume it will be on people's minds due to its success at GP Nagoya. The general existence of Frites decks all but guarantees hate and the deck doesn't auto-lose to hate but the matchups becomes much much rougher.

Long story short - what do you think the GP-AC meta will be and which deck (UWR Flash or Angel Combo) will be the better meta call?

1376787018.0,1kkw4n,[Modern] UWR Options,Apertural,22,4,22,"**Introduction**

I have been playing UWR for quite sometime now and still haven't gotten a good understanding of Modern as a format. So I think it is a good time to make that push and really get into the format on MTGO. I have all the cards for UWR Contorl and Midrange. UWR is a top deck in the format and there are many choices in these colors. Recently the main creatures of the midrange have shifted dropping Geist in favor of a more controlling card package. With so many people jumping onto UWR after Shahar's recent Victory at the 2013 World Championship I think it is a good time to talk about the recent changes and what we can do with the deck itself and some card choices I can get into later.

**The Decks**

[Shahar Shenhar's winning list from Worlds](http://www.mtgtop8.com/event?e=5388&amp;d=231110)

I enjoyed watching him play this deck throughout the tournament especially in the top 4 and the finals. I like the solo Ajani and I like the creature package but I'm wondering why has Geist of Saint Traft been removed from Midranges 75? This seems like a Flash deck more than a midrange.

[Sammy Tukeman's 2nd place decklist from GP San Diego](http://www.mtgtop8.com/event?e=4573&amp;d=226496)

This is the deck I purchased as soon as I saw it. I love control and I love the colors of UWR

[Orie Guo 5/8 Decklist](http://www.mtgtop8.com/event?e=4927&amp;d=228454)

I didn't get a chance to see this tournament but he placed fairly well and still had Geist in the 75. With some interesting additions like Grim Lavamancer and Mana Tithe and no Restoration Angels. This seemed to be more of a tempo deck than a Midrange deck but really didn't catch on.

[The Control Variant at Worlds](http://www.mtgtop8.com/event?e=5388&amp;d=231112)

When I watched Ben Stark and Shahar Shenhar play in the top 4 I thought Stark was favored but was rooting for Shenhar. This is different from Sammy's list it uses 4 Snapcaster Mages and Drops Ajani Vengeant for a solo Gideon Jura. Why Hallowed Burial over Terminus?

**Card Choices**

*Creatures*

* Geist of Saint Traft - at the three drop it can really close games out quickly and has been a staple of the deck for quite sometime now.
* Snapcaster Mage - An auto include in most blue decks since he is all utility.
* Restoration Angel - A powerful 4 drop that has a lot of favorable blocks in the format and can swing well also has flash
* Vendilion Clique - Flashes in and removes combo pieces and other cards we can't deal with from their hands.
* Thundermaw Hellkite - Hasty 5 drop beater that kills Souls and taps fliers excellent for racing.
* Aven Mindcensor - Hate card with flash can shut down Pod and fetch lands.
* Baneslayer Angel - Another 5 drop beater that is great at closing out games.
* Batterskull - Not techniaclly a creature but is another great 5 drop finisher.
* Grim Lavamancer - Kind of bad with snapcaster but can remove cards like fetches for extra damage.
* Lightning Angel - 4 drop with haste and evasion
* Teferi

*Counter Magic*

* Cryptic Command - 4 Mana do whatever you want sounds good.
* Mana Leak - Great in the beginning of the game but loses a lot of power after that.
* Spell Snare - Counters the most important cards in the format.
* Remand - Tempo Counter that has some tricks.
* Izzet Charm - Each mode is over costed but the variety is what makes this a good card.
* Counterflux - Usually in the side for Control match ups and stops storm.
* Negate - a good counterspell.
* Dispel - 1 mana counter for instants.
* Spell Pierce - 1 mana counter that is alike Mana Leak and is a mode in Izzet Charm.
* Mana Tithe - White Counter that can catch people off guard.

*Burn/Removal*

* Lightning Helix - 2 Mana 6 life swing is good
* Lightning Bolt - The Main burn of this deck 1 mana 3 damage can do a lot.
* Electrolyze - Card advantage and can 2 for 1 pesky x/1's in the format.
* Path To Exile - Path to Exile

*Others*

* Sphinx's Revelation - This card is nuts in all formats and can really change the direction of a game or put it out of reach.
* Supreme Verdict / Wrath of God - 4 Mana Board wipes that have a plus to each of them.
* Shadow of Doubt - Hate card for pod and fetches if need be that replaces itself.
* Think Twice - Best card draw we have that is still bad.
* Sword of ______ - The swords are all pretty powerful in there own way

*Planeswalkers*

* Ajani Vengeant - Lightning Helix on a stick and a one sided Armageddon ultimate.
* Elspeth
* Gideon Jura - Can be a creature and takes damage for you.
* There are other U/W/R walkers but I don't think any of them fit our game plan.(Ral Zarek, Other Ajanis, Elspeth Tirel)

*Sideboard**

* Stony Silence / Kataki
* Pyroclasm - Really hurts a lot of decks like Pod.
* Celestial Purge - Liliana of the Veil and other Black stuff
* Engineered Explosives - Just a good card
* Sowing Salt / Molten Rain - Mana Denial along side Tec Edge main board Hurts Tron a lot.
* Threads of Disloyalty - Tarmogoyf
* Wear / Tear - Better than Disenchant
* Spellskite - Hate for a lot of cards in the format
* Relic of Progenitus / Grafdigger's Cage - Graveyard Hate

**Thoughts**

UWR has a lot of choices on what kind of deck they want to play as and what kind of creature/burn/counter package they want and That's what makes it a tier 1 deck in the format. I really enjoy this format and I find myself looking for changes and reasoning behind changes to the deck I am running. So I would like a more in depth understanding of UWR and Modern as format itself. If there are any new decklist or cards to check out I'm all ears and would love to give them a try.

**Questions I have** 

* Why has Geist been dropped from recent lists?
* Why aren't the swords used more?
* What other variations of UWR are there that can really shake up the format?
* Which is the best version in the current format?
* Why aren't there other U/W/x decks in the format such as esper and bant?

http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/prime-speaker-bant-09-07-13-1/

I've stuck with this deck

* Voice of Resurgence is supposedly an obvious inclusion, so there's that.
* Progenitor Mimic started as a joke, the Mimic usually ends up being a removal sink, getting killed before the next upkeep. Still, I believe having the opponent play around Mimic is a benefit of its own. 
* Advent of the Wurm is great to bring in for aggro

MATCHUPS:

I've tested against: 

* R/G Aggro and Naya Aggro - This is a fairly simple match to play against, turn 3 Advent should stall long enough until I find a Thragtusk. Supreme Verdict comes in as a reset button, and Trostani comes in for the extra lifegain. 

* Jund Midrange - A tough matchup. It usually ends up grindy and extended, I bring in the 3rd and 4th Slime, along with Sigarda. Selesnya Charm also replaces Azorius Charm, dealing with their 'tusks, Sires (and if shit hits the fan), their pumped Olivia's. I've tried bringing in Clone and Pithing Needle, but this usually dilutes the deck's power. 

* Junk Reanimator - More or less the same as Jund Midrange

* Junk Aristocrats - This is interesting. I haven't tested against this deck as much, though I'm really shaky on a sideboard plan here. 

* U/W/x Control - Frankly, but I have no trouble beating them down post-Verdict. Slime comes in, Azorius Charms come out, and that's really about it. I'm thinking Advent might be good here, but I'm not really sure.

I can go through this deck in detail.  I have playtested it a lot. And this deck has very few bad matchups.  My most recent FNM

With Gate crash coming out, and will use blind obediance sideboard for the rdw matchup



**Agaist RDW:**

+2 supreme Verdict

+3 lingering Souls (normally a bit hesitant due to Ash Zealot)

-2 sever the bloodline

-1 angel of serenity

-1 craterhoof behemoth

-1 alchemist refuge

Definitely my worst matchup is RDW, If i can get t4 or t5 angel i normally win.


**Against Naya Aggro:**

+2 supreme verdict

+3 golgari charm  (wrecks there tokens, and will destroy rest in peace/nevermore

+1 sundering growth

-2 sever the bloodline 

-1 cavern of souls

-1 Angel of Serenity

-1 Craterhoof Behemoth

-1 Centaur Healer or Thragtusk (depending on how aggro their deck is)

Again a little bit of a rougher matchup


**Against Reanimator:**

+3 Deathrite Shaman

-1 centaur healer

-1 cavern of souls

-1 thragtusk

I have played against 2 different reanimator decks, but with sever the bloodline and alchemist refuge to flash in my angel whenever i wanted. it ends pretty shortly after that.
Against Human reanimator


**Zombies**

Depending on exactly which type of zombie they run will vary what comes in

+2 verdict

+2 golgari charm (sometimes

+2 deathrite shaman (gets rid of gravecrawler and geralf's)

-1 Thragtusk

-1 craterhoof

-1 angel

Not a horrible matchup


**Door To Nothingness**

+2 sundering growth

sometimes something else

-1 cavern of souls

-1 angel of serenity

Surprisingly this is a difficult matchup, I normally can force their fogs and win quickly.


**Against Control**

+1 Cavern of Souls

+3 deathrite shaman

-2 terminus

-2 supreme verdict

I don't think this deck has ever lost a game to control.  I was very close one time, and we got to time before we could finish game one.  I ended up with less than 10 cards in my deck. Normally, alchemist refuge and cavern of souls together will wreck control, then deathrite shaman is there to take care of their snapcaster or their Tamiyo emblem.


**Bant hexproof**

+2 supreme verdict

-1 angel of serenity

-1 cavern of souls
I haven't got to play against it much but I normally hit a fieldwipe and thats enough to change it into my favor

Her opponent neglected to vocally announce the Stab Wound triggers, doesn't say anything or change her life total.  She is not responsible for her opponent's missed triggers under the current rules.

I have spent a few weeks crafting together a deck for the WMCQ this weekend and I feel I've got it right.  At first I was planning on running RG aggro but I decided why not run white?  White gives you access to Voice of Resurgence as well as Loxodon Smiter which is where I started.  Then

I switched out those cards for a playset of both the GW Charm as well as Call of the Conclave

Now

Pillar of Flame as a one of is necessary

Two Drops:

Flinthoof Boar is an insane card, the only gripe is it does not work well with Rest in Peace. Now, the searing spears are solid because they give me the reach to kill or just blow up a guy. The GW Charm's are full of utility, I have a problem against Reanimator so when they get their angel, EoT I get my guys back without them being able to reanimate her again.  The Boros Charms allow for blowouts such as Ghor-Clan+Boros charm, or just insurance against board wipes.

Three Drops:

Boros Reckoner is a god damn beast.  He can almost always two for one your opponent so I made it sure that I can always cast him on turn 3

Four Drops:
Ghor-Clan, this guy + reckoner is so brutal. Only 3 because it sucks having two in the opening hand.

There's the deck! I have yet to playtest it other than having a couple hands, 25 hands so it's got really tight mana.  Comment on what you think of it, such as matchup potential and if it has a good shot of taking down the WMCQ.

For example

* Do you want more of Liliana in an aggro matchup for the 3 drop removal? Or less because she's too slow? 

* Is it a good idea to keep her in a Naya matchup when they could Loxodon? Or is the discard disruption enough to not be bothered by it?

* How about against Rites? Do you really want to help them get more things into the graveyard? Or is the removal powerful enough to justify her inclusion?


**Bonfire:**

* Do you leave these in versus other midrange decks? It clears out mana dorks and eventually can sweep even AoS. However

**Tragic Slip:**

Let's look at what format all-stars we're working with:

**RED:**

* Bonfire of the Damned
* Hellrider
* Searing Spear
* Thundermaw Hellkite
* Zealous Conscripts
* Rakdos Cackler
* Ash Zealot

**BLUE:**

* Delver of Secrets
* Snapcaster Mage
* Dissipate
* Syncopate
* Augur of Bolas
* Jace
* Unsummon

**GREEN:**

* Thragtusk
* Farseek
* Strangleroot Geist
* Arbor Elf
* Garruk

**MULTI:**

* Huntmaster of the Fells
* Alchemist's Refuge

There are also many cards with potential that haven't seen much play this season. Things like Quirion Dryad, Izzet Charm, Simic Charm, etc. There are too many to list.

**Potential RUG Archetypes:**

* Aggro: Not my first choice of colors when considering aggro, strangleroot geist, ash zealot. I'm not really feeling it but I won't leave it out.

* Midrange: I'd say there's a lot of potential here. You've got the traditional Huntmaster, Loxodon that white brings, so I guess it's just a matter of what does blue bring to make up for that? Counters are nice, maybe not in a creature meta filled with cavern of souls though. Draw is good. There are a few good blue creatures that haven't seen play yet. Deadeye Navigator might be a good alternative to Restoration Angel. Gatecrash is a weak set but there might be potential in Zegana.

* Control: Control isn't really my strong suite. I think RUG lacks the board wipes needed for control. I don't know if bonfire is a good enough replacement wipe

* Tempo: Maybe the best hope for these colors being tournament-playable. Red for cheap burn, possibly Mayor, also as a splash for simic charm.



I've been trying out a tempo deck running 4x Delver, nearly all 1-2 cmc tempo and counters with all stars like simic charm and izzet charm. It seems to work pretty well. I'd post a decklist but it's not refined enough yet for /r/spikes.

Alan Lee – Lifebane Jund – 6th Place

Here is a tournament report from my 6th place finish at SCG Open: SLC. I played in the Saturday Open and ended up going 3-4 and dropping. 

[**Deck List**](http://sales.starcitygames.com//deckdatabase/displaydeck.php?DeckID=58342)

**Round 1: Matt – UWR Flash**
**Game 1:** This is a long drawn out game and he ends up winning after playing Sphinx’s Revelation 3x and I just ran out of threats and had a lot of useless removal cards in hand. When I could land a Thragtusk
**Game 2:** I sideboard out most of my removal and bring in my good cards. I am able to keep my threats on the board and win fairly easily. I was also able to resolve a Ruric
**Game 3:** He gets stuck on 3 land and I have farseek and double liliana of the veil. He counters the first one but I am able to resolve the 2nd and start destroying his hand. I am able to Rakdos’s Return and land a thragtusk.
1-0	(2-1)

**Round 2: Steven – UWR Flash**
**Game 1:** He counters a few of my threats and is able to Sphinx’s Revelation for 4 and then for 6. The game goes longer but I end up scooping when I run out of threats.
**Game 2:** He keeps slow hand and I end up casting a thragtusk into a Ruric Thar. He is down to 10 and can’t do anything and scoops.
**Game 3:** We both keep and he doesn’t have counter  for my thragtusk. He does Warleader Helix after I get one swing with my thragtusk but I am able to wolf run my beast and Olivia to win.
2-0	(4-2)

**Round 3: Julia – Bant Hexproof**
**Game 1:** I keep a slow hand and she throws down a turn 1 Gladecover Scout and suits it up and I die on turn 5.
**Game 2:** I have Farseek into Lifebane Zombie into double Thragtusk. She tries to race me with a suited up Invisible Stalker (no Unflinching Courage) but I am able to win the race.
**Game 3:** She plays a Voice and hits me for 2 into a Smiter. I remove the Voice on my turn and she swings in the next turn and plays an Invisible Stalker. On my turn I cast a Golgari Charm

3-0	(6-3)

**Round 4: Jeremy – Junk Aristocrats**
**Game 1:** I end up playing a Lifebane Zombie into a Thragtusk but I run out of Sac outlets for desecration demon and die.
**Game 2:** I get off to a fast start with a Farseek  and removal. I play Thragtusk then I play a Scavenging Ooze and eat everything up.
**Game 3:** He gets a blood artist out quick but I am able to get rid of it. He ends up with a board of Desecration Demon

3-1 (7-5)

**Round 5: Lance – U/W Control**
**Game 1:** I am able to play a few thragtusks but he is able to rev and ult Jace and I scoop.
**Game 2:** I sideboard in a ton of cards and he has a slow start and he can’t stop my huntmaster and thragtusk.
**Game 3:** I am able to rakdos return him for 2. The next turn I am able to Duress when he has 3 cards in hand. He thinks about it for a little bit and he ends up not countering it. He shows an Aetherling

4-1 (9-6)

**Round 6: Thomas – R/W Aggro**
**Game 1:** He is on the play and throws down a turn 2 Thalia and it really just slows down my hand because I had a farseek in hand and I could have played huntmaster a turn early but end up falling behind too much.
**Game 2:** I am able to play a Thragtusk to kind of stabilize against his early aggression but then I miracle a bonfire for 4 wiping his board of Sublime/Knight of Glory and Silverblade. I follow it up with a Scavenging Ooze and a Huntmaster and he can’t recover from the Bonfire.
**Game 3:** I keep a removal heavy hand and am able to deal with his threats. He tries to play Burning Earth and I float G/B to Golgari Charm after it resolves. I am able to land 2 huntmasters and ride them to victory.

5-1 (11-7)

**Round 7: Buddy – Rakdos Control**
**Game 1:** I am able to keep bigger threats on the board and end up winning the top deck battle.
**Game 2:** He Rakdos’s Returns me and I do it back and he ends up winning the top deck battle with Bonfire.
**Game 3:** I start off with a Farseek into Huntmaster then another Huntmaster. He Returns me for 2 then Mutilates and wipes the board. We are both in top deck mode and life totals are 20-4. I’m not worried because I’m thinking I will surely be able to draw something before he kills me. I also have Bonfire/Rakdos to just win the game. I draw a land and he top decks a Desecration Demon, I say no blocks and go down to 2. He has 1 card in hand a passes. I draw, ping desecration demon and swing in for 4. He shows a land and I win!

6-1 (13-8)

**Round 8** 
After 7 rounds of Swiss

6-1-1 (13-8-3)

**Top 8**
It is announced that the 4th seed is my Round 4 opponent (Jeremy) and then I am the 5th seed. I’m not happy about playing against him again especially on the draw again.

**Game 1:** I am able to stay alive and get him to 12. I misplay by playing a bonfire for 2 then playing a Garruk Primal Hunter. He had a desecration demon and is able to swing with that. I should have played the Garruk
**Game 2:** He gets off to a decent start and all I have is 2 Lifebane Zombies. I have an Olivia in hand and I’m hoping to ride that out to victory but I know he has 2x Tragic Slip and I’m not able to comeback and win.

6-2-1 (13-10-3)

All in all, Primal Hunter in and an Abrupt Decay. As I walk into the tournament, I decide to change it back and play the same 75 as the day before. I ended up playing well and it just goes to show that just because you do poorly with a deck one day that you can’t be successful the next. I think that I played a lot better on Sunday, had good matchups and got lucky a few times.

**Moving forward:**
I dislike the Lifebane Zombies. I have taken them out and added more removal. I feel like it is a great card but it is not a great card for Jund in the current Meta. If Big Domri Naya or Junk Reanimator is big again I can see including it.
Just remember
See you at the invitational in Vegas and many more events!

1374253073.0,1in3ka,"[Standard] BW Zombies, Junk Aristocrats, and abusing the new 3 drops.",hehepeter,15,26, but in my opinion the mana is bad for t2 GW t3 1BB.  Joshua Silvestri suggests moving to a mostly BW shell for humans




Lets start with Junk Aristocrats:



Decklist: http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/junk-aristocrats-18-07-13-5/



This deck attempts to make the best possible use of a creature recursion engine.  



-Obviously the nuts is having Aristocrat



-Some people are arguing for the removal of blood artist


-Personally I like Avacyn's Pilgirm as the one drop of choice. For 1, especially if you can curve out into T3 Garruk or T4 Obzedat/Increasing Devotion.  Also T2 Souls T3 Aristocrat Blood Artist is a very strong line of play.  The way I see it, if we are cutting young wolf we need to improve our clock and get to the endgame a little faster.  This is IMO the best deck for Pilgrim yet.


- A notable ommision is Skirsdag High priest.  Act II cut him because they only had Doomed Traveler to set up a turn 3 demon. This deck now runs into the same problem.  Priest also doesn't play well with Necromancer








Now I wanted to also get some input on this BW Zombies build: 


http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/bw-zombies-18-07-13-1/


The mana for this deck is much better than what Junk is doing, possibly back to back.  Against Naya you get Aurelia, Reckoner, Voice, Resto Angel.  The number of creature that are either White or Green right now is astounding.  


-Between Resto Angel, and Geralf's Messenger, you should win any attrition war by a long long mile.  


-Obviously has some problems with RG aggro as it doesn't block.  Luckily Doom blade is a catch all against them and makes Ghor-Clan Rampager look bad.  On the play you can hit the very troublesome reckoner with LB Zombie



Against Reanimator



- This deck hates pillar of flame and will obviously see some cross hate because of VoR





Hopefully these decks are good starting points for discussing the future of aristocrats style decks well into theros.  We have some great tools and we seem pretty divided on how to best use them.  Please let me know what you think of my sample decks as well,,False,,t5_2utkz,False,,True

The deck list is quite similar to the one used in spring states by Raymond Perez (Planeswalker-heavy). The deck has a steady performance vs. aggressive decks and does particularly well against Jund but suffers heavily against Reanimator and particular cards (see below for examples).

Long story short, (Domri and Garruk in particular which Esper has nearly no answer, save Detention Sphere) and even Assemble (although Jayce, Architect of Thought does handle the card quite effectively) it just seems like I'm bashing my head against a brick wall playing a SLOW Tier two control deck. So I'm giving control another shot with American Midrange, specifically this following decklist:

1 AEtherling 2 Snapcaster Mage -Creatures (3)

1 Jace

4 Azorius Charm 3 Dissipate 2 Essence Scatter 3 Pillar of Flame 2 Searing Spear 3 Sphinx's Revelation 2 Supreme Verdict 2 Syncopate 1 Terminus 1 Assemble the Legions 3 Think Twice 2 Turn // Burn 2 Warleader's Helix -Spells [30]

Reasons for some of my changes:

* 15 lands was too inconsistent. 4x Blinkmoth/4x Inkmoth seemed too important. I put in an island over the Steam Vents because getting hit by a Path really hurts otherwise.

* Thoughtcast seemed too important. Having only two didn't seem right.

But after playing my list a bit in the last week

* Dispatch over Galvanic Blast? Dispatch is almost always a better Path

* Is Steelshaper's Gift worth playing? I've considered dropping a Thoughtcast for one since I am usually digging for a Cranial Plating anyway.

Both forms of the deck run 7-8 loot abilities and a play set of thought scours.  These form the backbone of the decks as they allow for massive filtering and feed your graveyard.  Later on they can still be used for spellcast triggers at a small cost.  They both also utilize artful dodge and nivix cyclops.

Do we think this list has staying power or is it just a fluke finish? All the random 1 of's in the main lead me to think it could use some tuning if it is going to compete with the rest of the tier 1/2 decks running around standard at the moment.

My first thought would be that the rise of Voice/Giest decks increasing the number of Pillar of Flames seeing play makes this deck a rough choice.

1360693695.0,18e1zb,[Modern] Pleasantly surprised by M(-ish)BC,v1ND,18,5,25,"I went looking for modern decks running DRS and stumbled across [this](http://www.mtgtop8.com/event?e=4157&amp;d=224327):

    7 Swamp
    4 Inkmoth Nexus
    4 Overgrown Tomb
    4 Verdant Catacombs
    2 Howltooth Hollow
    1 Urborg

    4 Dark Confidant

    SB: 2 Deathrite Shaman
    SB: 4 Infest
    SB: 4 Nature's Claim
    SB: 3 Nihil Spellbomb
    SB: 2 Sickening Shoal

After a bit of play testing online

Deathrite with retrace is quite nice on our side. Howltooth+Liliana also play very nicely together. All the discard help to give DRS and pike lots to work with.

I think there's still a lot of room for refinement:

* LftL is something I'd like to fit in. Howltooth does a surprising amount of work late game. Being able to chain GQ-Howltooth-LftL late game. Dropping more spells in the yard to fuel pike. Extra ammo for Raven's Crime. This might be more of a small pox/deathcloud tech.

* Worm Harvest? If I go the LftL route. Probably both as singletons in the board for the slower match-ups. An iffy SB addition.

* Fulminator Mage. Was kind of surprised to not see it in the board. Tron has always been big in my local meta however.

* Enaring Bridge. DRS can still get in for damage when you're in top-deck mode and a naked inkmoth can get the job done relatively quickly. Seems like it would be more effective against aggro than the 4 infest. Much of the removal is for targetted at smaller creatures; a large goyf, or boggle could be hard to deal with. 

How would you say a deck like this is positioned at the moment? What weak match-ups are you fore-seeing? What changes would you make to the maindeck/board? What experience have you had with the deck (or similar ones)?

EDIT: I'll keep a live list with changes I make below.

    5 Swamp

Current thoughts:

* Maelstrom Pulse vs. Abrupt Decay. I have no real out to large creatures with high cost or a resolved pod in game 1.

* Geth's verdict. Again more reach against larger creatures.

* Discard. I'm shy of thoughtseize due to its price tag. IoK I haven't touched as a 4 of but I keep varying raven's crime, but otherwise nearly hymn.

* Bgw. I love lingering souls. Great lili fodder with flashback. Even if I can't find white (unlikely)

When comparing the mana from before and after Gatecrash, shouldn't the black splash in Naya be easier to sustain?

Here is where I think I might be wrong (I am relatively new to Naya and don't have the experience in it that other might have): Pre-Gatecrash, the splash for black allowed them access to Overgrown Tomb and potentially Blood Crypt. Therefore, this black splash came at a relatively minimal cost to the mana-base and gave the deck a powerful mid-game spell in Rakdos's Return as well as a greater variety of sideboard options (i.e. Rakdos's Return). Furthermore, being Farseek targets meant that the additional shock were quite easily accessible (why would you have cast Farseek for a mountain when you could have gotten a Blood Crypt instead?).

Now, the cards that the black splash gave access to are not even that great right now. Rakdos's Return is mediocre at best in the aggro-heavy format that is currently prevalent (although it does break mid-range mirrors) and Slaughter Games is sub-par for the same reasons.

* Wait until I have mana then play spire golems/delvers and protect them with the remaining mana and extra cards I'll have drawn.  In this case
* Don't play creatures until I've ran them out of counterspells by fighting over mulldrifters and the like.  In this case
* Counter any 2-for-1 they have

Is this just a bad matchup for me?  What are the important cards that I should be fighting over?  How soon should I try to put them on a clock?  What are good maindeck/sideboard cards vs. them?

5. My friend playing GW Aggro. Lost game one

Based on this I'm not sure if this deck is actually alright or if I just got crazy lucky. I do know that it was the most fun I've had playing magic in a long time. I got to win with Door to Nothingness four times. Four! I realise I didn't play against anyone playing counterspells

So I've been playing UW Draw-Go for the past couple weeks (74/75 of Adam Prosak's initial list, Bant, Junk, and control feel like auto-wins. That said, the deck does seem to be gaining speed, and as it does there will certainly be hate for it. I predict that anyone playing slower decks like Jund will likely pack some Cavern of Souls, but many will eschew the deck altogether for something faster. BR Zombies should also be picking up in speed.

So where does the deck go? My first predictions are adaptations to beat the mirror. It seems as though the mirror is often decided by who plays more lands and who has Cavern of Souls, Sky Summoner. If you untap with him in the mirror, you win, no matter what. The only thing an opponent can do is Unsummon it over and over, especially if you have Cavern naming Wizard.

What also may become necessary as Zombies becomes more prevalent is to play UWr Draw-Go, I don't know what I would take out of the deck to add Pillar and Spear. I'm also not sure how consistent the mana base is. If anyone has a good list for this, please link it in the comments. 

The most interesting new tech I've seen is Todd Anderson's use of Jace's Phantasm. I have no idea how good it is, or is it more cute than effective?

1375069113.0,1j96n6,[Standard] Green Bay PTQ Report – Jund and sideboard plans,lokimorgan,21,7,4,"This is my first tournament report so feedback is appreciated. :)

I played Adam Jansen’s standard Jund build.  It was similar to this one - http://sales.starcitygames.com/deckdatabase/displaydeck.php?DeckID=55876 - but with these changes:

**Main deck**
*Creatures:*
Out – 2 Sire of Insanity
In – 3 Scavenging Ooze

*Planeswalkers:*
Out – 1 Liliana of the Veil 

*Lands:*
Out – 1 Cavern of Souls

*Spells:*
Out – 1 Ground Seal, 1 Rakdos Keyrune
In – 2 Pillar of Flames, 1 Doom Blade

**New Sideboard:**

2 Lifebane Zombie

1 Rakdos’s Return

1 Golgari Charm

3 Liliana of the Veil

1 Appetite for Brains

1 Barter in Blood

2 Vampire Nighthawk

1 Underworld Connections

1 Tragic Slip

1 Duress

1 Vraska the Unseen

I piloted the deck for the first time the night before the PTQ at FNM and this was my first time playing Jund so I was not very confident going into the tournament.  My husband plays Jund in every format and since we share cards I always end up with a different deck.  Now I understand why he likes Jund so much!  One of the biggest strengths I see with the deck is its ability to adapt and change based on your opponent.  I played terribly but I got some very valuable experience especially with the sideboard plans.  I hope you find this interesting.

Congratulations to Connor Birdsall who won the PTQ with his Naya build.

**Round 1 Me vs Steve – Mono Red Aggro**


*Game 1:* I kept a really slow hand the first game and was punished for it.  After 4 hits I was dead.


*Sideboard:*


Out – 2 radkos’s return
In – 2 vampire nighthawk


*Game 2:* In this game I was able to stabilize early with a hard cast bonfire and win.


*Game 3:* I lost this one due to two main factors.  I made a big mistake not mulliganing correctly.   I was on the draw and threw back my first hand.  I decided to keep a 6 that was way too slow.  I had four lands, Primal Hunter.  I was nervous to go down to 5 cards because I was just being dumb.  I continued to make this mistake for the first part of the tournament but I understand now that with this deck I need to throw back hands with nothing to do before turn 4. 

He also had 2 burning earths out so there was that.


**Round 2 Me vs Alex – GU Evolve?**


Unfortunately Alex had a deck registration error so he came to the table with 1 loss.  We started the second game without sideboarding and I won.  


**Round 3 Me vs Travis – America Control**


*Game 1:* I cast 3 farseeks and had my Thragtusk countered before I died.


*Sideboard:*


Out – 2 putrefy, 2 pillar of flame, 1 dreadbore
In – 1 golgari charm, 1 duress, 3 liliana of the veil, 1 appetite for brains


*Game 2:* I was able to just throw out creatures to be countered until I got to resolve some threats and won this one.


*Game 3:* I lost this one due to my own hesitancy to put out Garruk.  He had a restoration angel on the field so I was hoping to deal with her by hardcasting bonfire before I put him out.  In hindsight I should have put him out


**Round 4 Me vs Jacky – BRW Unicorns**


In the woman mirror I battled against Obzedat


I sideboarded in the same manner as I would against BGW Aristocrats


Out – 2 rakdos’s returns
In – 1 golgari charm


**Round 5 Me vs Luke – Jund mirror**


I was able to win this one in three games.  There was actually one pretty fantastic moment in which is probably the moment I started to love Jund.

 
I kept a hands with lands, and rakdos’s return.  I just kept accerating until boom, discard all 6 of your cards.  


*Sideboard:*


Out – 1 abrupt decay, 1 scavenging ooze, 2 pillar of flame
In – 1 appetite for brains, 1 rakdos’s return, 1 underworld connections


**Round 6 Me vs Nick – Esper Control**


*Game 1:* I learnt a hard lesson this game.  When your opponent casts Sphinx’s Revelations twice and you are basically out of threats you should just scoop and go to the next game.  I let him kill me slowly while trying to fight myself out of it.  


*Sideboard:*


Out – 1 tragic slip, 2 pillar of flame, 1 bonfire
In – 1 rakdos’s return, 3 liliana, 1 appetite for brains


*Game 2:* Here I also made a huge mistake.  I had him slow-ish so I decided to hit him with damage instead of Tamiyo.  Soon after Jace came out.  With both planeswalkers live he was able to stabilize and come back to win with about a minute left in the round.


**Round 7: Me vs Scott – RBW **


For some reason I’m having trouble remembering everything that Scott was playing.  I think there were lingering souls, and Obzedat.  


I sideboarded similar to how I would for BGW aristocrats shown above.


**Round 8: Me vs Charming Bob and his Pigs for Rolling – Jund Mirror**


We rolled pigs to see who went first.  Bob won and I trust that he was following some format to score the rolls. 


The sideboard plan for the Jund mirror is shown above.


In the Jund mirror you have the ability to outplay your opponent.  If you both play optimally then it seems to just come to who draws better.


**Bant Hexproof**
I did not see Bant Hexproof which was the matchup I was the most worried about.  Here is how I would have sideboarded.


Out – 2 rakdos’s return, primal hunter, 1 thundermaw, 2 putrefy, 1 thragtusk


There are a couple more matchups that I worked out but I didn’t see.  If you’re interested in any specific ones let me know but understand they weren’t tested.

Besides him, Deathrite Shaman, and either or both Garruks. Is this enough for the base of something competitive? I'm not sure but I'd like to try.

One thing the deck needs is some kind of protection/recovery from boardwipes and heavy removal: Ready, Urban Evolution, Garruk, Caller of Beasts, and/or Creeping Renaissance seem to be our best options. If we do use Ready, the black we're splashing for Deathrite can be used for Willing, too. We *could* go deep into three or four colours but I doubt it's worth it.

3x Rhox Faithmender

2x Sever the Bloodline



A couple of notes on deck choice:


I have been playing Junk Rites for something like two months now

As you can see, but aside from a more favorable matchup in the mirror, I haven't seen the newer deck do enough to convince me to switch.

Finally, we were informed that Bant Hexproof and Naya Midrange were ruling the top tables for the most part at Saturday's WMCQ tournament at the same site. I decided to cut 2x Lotleth Troll and a sideboard card to make room for Lili, whom I thought could really help against those relatively poor matchups. I added a 24th land, the third Godless Shrine, to make the double black a bit easier, and registered my list.


Rd. 1 vs. Javier Berrones (Mono Green)

My first round opponent was running the Predator Ooze deck, and cleared the way for a heavy-handed win. Game 2, the Ooze dropped on turn 2, but a timely rip of Sever the Bloodline dealt with the threat and Centaur Healer and Restoration Angel both kept my life total high and created a powerful board presence, allowing me to bring down my opponent in just a few swings.

Special shout-out to Javier

-1 Craterhoof Behemoth, Ghost Council, +2 Sever the Bloodline

2-0 Win (1-0)


Rd. 2 vs. Susan Zell (Jund)

My opponent this round was unforunately informed that she was being awarded a game loss due to a deck registration error. We shuffled up for the official game 2, I untapped, brought in a Craterhoof Behemoth from the yard and bashed with some Lingering Souls tokens for 19. In a test match afterwards, I discovered that Lily can be quite effective against the deck post-sideboard, as the typical plan is to sideboard out their own Lilianas.

Susan went on to recover and end up a match away from making Top 8.

2-0 Win (2-0)


Rd. 3 vs. Andrew Baeckstrom (4C Reanimator)

My third round opponent was playing an interesting take on the deck, as his 4 color manabase came together too late after I generated an early Thragtusk.

-2 Craterhoof Behemoth, +3 Deathrite Shaman, +1 Obzedat, Ghost Council, +2 Sever the Bloodline

2-0 Win (3-0)


Rd. 4 vs. Justin Kanthak (Naya Mid-Middle-Range)

Justin was running a list the landed somewhere in between the Naya Blitz decks and the five-drop Naya Midrange decks. In game 1, he had to mulligan to 5 and was essentially forced to keep a hand of lands and Searing Spears. A Skullcrack kept my life total from getting out of hand, but his lack of board presence made this game not even close.

-2 Craterhoof Behemoth, -1 Arbor Elf, +3 Abrupt Decay, +2 Rhox Faithmender, +2 Sever the Bloodline

2-0 Win (4-0)


Rd. 5 vs. Shea Strausman (Jund)

This was my second match of the day against an archetype that had been showing up in decent numbers at the top tables. Game 1 was a nail-biter, while I, at 6 life, had 5 lands, two mana dorks, a Lingering Souls token and an Angel of Serenity, with two more in hand. He passed the turn, but chose to kill a Spirit token rather than the second mana creature. I ripped a land and slammed Angel to all but wipe his board. After attempting to stabilize with the Olivia and another creature

-2 Craterhoof Behemoth, +3 Acidic Slime, +1 Obzedat, Ghost Council, +2 Sever the Bloodline

2-0 Win (5-0)


Rd. 6 vs. Nick Edgerle (Junk Rites)

My opponent's Rites deck was on the Farseek plan, he was in need of black mana for several turns, while my Spirit tokens and later fat creatures allowed my to push for the kill before he could stabilize.

-2 Craterhoof Behemoth, +3 Deathrite Shaman, +1 Obzedat, Ghost Council, +2 Sever the Bloodline

2-0 Win (6-0)


Rd. 7 vs. Oscar Jones (Junk Aristocrats)
I had just heard of this deck the day before when Brad Nelson was piloting it to victory in SCG Baltimore. The deck seemed to double down on Skirsdag High Priest, with High Priest at the ready, and a whiffed Mulch combined with the fact that I did not see any Unburial Rites put the game squarely in his favor. In game 3, however, Centaur Healer gummed up the board early, and then the Angel of Serenity parade again proved too much for my opponent to handle.

Oscar went on to win his next match

-2 Craterhoof Behemoth, -1 Mulch, +3 Abrupt Decay, +3 Deathrite Shaman, +1 Obzedat, Ghost Council, +2 Sever the Bloodline

2-1 Win (7-0)


Rd. 8 vs. Raymond Perez Jr. (Esper Control)

As the only 7-0 players in the room

0-0 Draw (7-0-1)


Rd. 9 vs. Reed Hartman (Junk Rites)

After my Round 8 draw, featuring Fiend Hunter. Ten Sprit tokens off my Lingerling Souls game 1, however, proved impossible for him to deal with. In game 2, I learned of the power of Garruk Relentless in the mirror, as he ate my mana dork and eventually tutored up a game-winning Craterhoof Behemoth. After game 2, for whatever reason

-2 Craterhoof Behemoth, -1 Centaur Healer, +3 Acidic Slime, +3 Deathrite Shaman, +1 Obzedat, Ghost Council, +2 Sever the Bloodline

1-1 Draw (7-0-2)


Rd. Top 8 vs. Reed Hartman (Junk Rites)

My decision to draw came back to bite me as I was paired against my Round 9 opponent in the 3 vs. 6 matchup. I kept a questionably slow hand of 7 in game 1

I readjusted my sideboard plan after Round 9

-1 Craterhoof Behemoth, -1 Mulch, +2 Acidic Slime, +3 Deathrite Shaman, +2 Sever the Bloodline

0-2 Loss (7-1-2)



While I left with a bit of a bad taste in my mouth, and I think the move to Liliana was actually quite helpful. It also reinforced my knowledge that Angel of Serenity is just a crazy good card, and I will likely be finding a way to wedge in a fourth. As well as make room for a Garruk Relentless or two to help in the mirror. Again, congrats to Oscar and thanks for reading!",,False,,1370387537.0,t3_1foftx

I feel like this deck has a lot of room to grow and a lot of variation and innovation left in it

First off

Secondly, and this is a way to fight that. Again though, is it too dependent on our other cards to truly be worth considering?

And then there is Hydroform. Using our lands as blockers or a way to push damage through seems pretty good. It is more of a three mana spell than a two mana one but I feel like that isn't all that relevant. The biggest concern is that the deck plays so few lands so is it worth potentially losing our precious lands? Also

Lastly, which suffers a very similar fate. At only one mana it certainly looks appealing, but is the trample more valuable than the first strike Pike gives? Does Pike make our Spell Rupture that much better than Rancor does?

Naya has been quietly placing in most of the standard events for the past month while falling off everyone's radar. How well placed is it right now?

Naya has always had the problem of awkward draws that don't do much of anything until turn 4

Naya Midrange isn't well suited to going ""under"" anything like Blitz is, but 4 Thraggies doesn't seem right either. If we're going to go through Reanimator, which is rocking beasts and angels themselves, then we want our 5-drops to be winning the game instead of trying to help us gain an incremental advantage.

Thundermaw Hellkite and Zealous Conscripts seem well suited to this. At least

Something thing I've noticed is the absence on Bonfire in these lists for Mortars. I haven't tested much with Mortars

This is where I'm at right now. The sideboard is a mess because I've been changing it constantly. What does r/spikes think? Does this deck have the potential to actually win a major tournament as opposed to sneaking into the top 8/16?

I'm decided to play Junk (GWB) Reanimator. 

You've got a powerful reanimator strategy that can effectively fight the control decks and goes over the top of most other decks. You also can be a powerful midrange deck. 

The hate cards do very little to you. Unlike Human Reanimator

I wanted to discuss the deck

**Martin Juza's deck or Sam Black's?**

[Juza played this list at GP Verona](http://www.wizards.com/magic/samplehand.asp?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/gpver13/day2&amp;decknum=7). [Sam Black played this](http://www.wizards.com/magic/samplehand.asp?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/gpver13/day2&amp;decknum=8) (I believe Sperling is credited with the build). They're pretty different

I like Sam Black's list for quite a few reasons

* Playing a bunch of Elves is bad against various wrath effects. You also have to play a bunch of Forests
* Centaur Healer is not a powerful card. It doesn't match up well against a lot of the aggressive threats. If they have Flinthoof Boar or Searing Spear or Loxodon Smiter or Boros Reckoner
* Lotleth Troll and Lingering Souls are sweet cards that do powerful things. The latter also increases the value of Mulch and Grisly Salvage by a lot. 

But there's a counterpoint: 

* Juza's list a lot more explosive. Lots of elves makes you much faster. 
* Lingering Souls doesn't really block much. All the aggressive creatures are good against it. 
* Restoration Angel is a powerful card
* Centaur Healer is a good way to fight against the aggressive decks. 

So which one would you play

**When am I actually supposed to side out Unburial Rites?** 

I feel like I might be siding out the card too often in my testing. I think I almost always cut at least one of them after board (except against the control decks

Generally, but I'm not sure if it's right. Do I want to side out a land when I'm doing this? 

How should I be sideboarding? 

**Which sideboard cards are the right ones?** 

Deathrite Shaman is the obvious choice against the other Reanimator decks

Is Loxodon Smiter better post-board than Centaur Healer? 

Against the aggressive decks, but seems to have additional value in killing things like Hellrider. 

What do I want to be siding in against control decks? My choices are likely Duress

**Why shouldn't I play this deck?**

First tournament at competitive REL

**Match 1: Splinter-twin**

**Game 1**: I mulled down to 6 after a one land hand. I lost the die roll... and he proceeded to land a turn-3 flash in Pestermite into a turn-4 Splinter-twin. +2 spellskite, -3 Oust, -2 Baterskull, -1 Wall of Omens.

**Game two**, and a island in hand. Fortunately, I drew into a spreading seas, which allowed me to land Jace... leading into a ghostly prison, and a quick scoop from there.

**Game three**, landing goyfs turn 2 and 3. I top-decked into a d-sphere, and got a 2-for one. Spreading Seas his Manlands, and then Elspeth then went to work. 

**1-0**

**Match 2**: UW Control

**G1**: This... honestly was just a bit of a blur to me. I won game 1 by beating in with Eslpeth's Soldier tokens, while pathing his Angel, tec-edge his colonnade, just getting better draws. -3 Wall of Omens, -1 Wrath, +1 Verdict, +1 Meddling Mage

**Game 2**: Early Geist of St. Traft + Clique took the verdict I had in hand. Lingering souls became chump blockers

**Game 3**: Opening hand had 2 verdicts, we went to turns. He Sphinx'ed again for 8, right after I drew into a batterskull. We then proceeded to tie.

**1-0-1**

**Match 3: Jund**

**Game 1**: On the draw, +1 Meddling Mage, -1 Gideon, -1 D-sphere.
	
**Game 2**: Early Treetop Village went far. Then he dropped a thrun

**Game 3**:  Ousted a t-1 deathrite. Dsphere his goyf. Wall of Omens kept + Jace’s +1 Ability kept him from killing me. Inquisition took a Lingering Souls, and I drew into verdicts to kill them. We went to time.

**1-0-2**

**Game 4:  Affinity**

**G1**: He won the dice roll.. which won him the game. T1- Blinkmoth, ornithropter, memnite memnite, second signal pest. I... uh... ousted one, and attempted to stall until I could wrath. He got me to 8, then killed me with double Galvanic Blast (his turn 3 and 4 draws). +2 Stony Silence, +2 Ghostly Prison, +1 Verdict

**G2**: T2 Stony Silence

**G3**: Hit a T3 Ghostly Prison and a t4 Wrath. Won with spirit token + Elspeth beats. 

**2-0-2**

**Match 5: Tron**

This was the matchup I was definitely ready for. I've playtested primarily against Tron, and find that I win Tron 80% of the time.

**G1**- Spreading seas and Tec-edges did so much work it was ridiculous. He didn’t even get to 5 lands, +2 Path to Exile, -2 Verdict, -1 Wrath, -1 Wall of Omens,  -1 Jace.

**G**2- He must have had a nuts hand, he seemed to have two more. I had to path a wurmcoil, which gave him the lands to Karn. Following which, I scooped.

**G3**- Similar to game 1. Spreading seas did work

**3-0-2**

**Match 6**: Team America

**G1**- Geist ran rampant on me. Really couldn’t deal. Lingering Souls took out one, -3 Oust, +2 Path, -3 Sphere, +3 Rest in Peace.

**G2**- Opening hand had two verdicts. Thankfully

**G3**- Misplay on my part (Tapping for the wrong threat. Leaving Tec-edge open for Colonnade) prevented me from flashing back lingering souls to act as a blocker. When I was at 6, but he counterfluxed. There, I thought I misplayed, thinking I should have pathed the snapcaster in response to the angel being cast, but I realize now that, if I had done that, he would have colonade mana

**3-1-2**

**Match 7**: Some weird GWrb zoo deck. 

**G1**- Had to mulligan to 5 due to lands. Couldn’t deal with turn-2 Loxodon Smiter, -1 Spreading Seas, -1 Gideon, -1 Jace.

**G2**- Two wraths in a row killed Baneslayer, and I proceeded to just flat out with with Elspeth and Batterskull. 

**G3** – Almost went to time

**4-1-2**

**Match 8: Kiki-pod**

**G1**: I haven’t really playtested against kiki-pod, +2 Ghostly Prison, +2 Path to Exile, -2 Oust, +1 Verdict, -1 Elspeth.

**G2**: Mulled to 5

**Final Score: 4-2-2**

**What I learned about the deck**: I have a terrible matchup against any decks that can combo off turn 3. I'm probably going to take out the wall of Omens for Snapcasters, against the current meta, Superfriends control does some damn good work. I just need to learn to pilot it better.

**What I learned about events**: I need to bring water and food to these large events, almost all of which reached turns, is an absolutely nerve-wracking experience.

I'm still a bit jittery.

4-2-2. Not too terrible for my first major event. Definitely could have done better though. I consoled myself with picking up cards to pimp out my EDH deck with.

4 Wolfir Silverheart

Enchantments
4 Rancor

3 Scavenging Ooze
3 Thragtusk
3 Kalonian Hydra
1 Primeval Bounty
2 Naturalize
1 Garruk Relentless
1 Witchbane Orb
1 Ulvenwald Tracker

Couple things about the deck I like:
1.) This deck is very explosive. More on that in a bit.
2.) People forgot about Rancor the way they Forgot about Dre. 
3.) It's got predator ooze in it. 

The one thing I don't like about this version of the deck.
1.) It's soft to blood artist.

Round 1: Fight!

G/b OOZE..

In Round one I played against someone who was very excited to be playing Magic. He was so excited that he kept talking about the decisions he was making out loud. I won the die roll and played t2 Ooze t3

2-0 Games.

Round 2 Fight!

Jasper Johnson-Epstein playing Jund

Game one 

Jasper played like shit and knew it. Going into the final turn of the game Jasper was at 5

Jasper's board was Huntmaster, and an arbor elf. He cast a garruk, primal hunter off the top and cashed it in for 3 cards. He did some math and rakdos's returned me for 2 tapping the arbor elf putting me to 5, and attacked me proudly with his beast, his wolf, and his huntmaster. Proclaiming me dead and starting to pack his things up. I blocked his beast with my wolf and said ""I'll take 4 and go to 1"" Jasper had been looking at the wrong life total when he started his turn and thought I was at 5 before the return."" 

Jasper is a very good player

game 2 he crushed me

2-1

Round 3
U/W/R

You know what is awesome against supreme verdict? Indestructable trampling monsters. You know what is awesome against U/W/R? This deck. 

2-0

Round 4

Mono Red

The reason we played this deck when zombies and hellrider decks were good was because this deck is a bitch to attack into. Nice legion loyalist...

2-0

After I started 4-0 and Lukas﻿ and Court﻿ had long since died, you have your priorities fucked. You are representing a 3/3 not named olivia voldaren. Cast the Hydra, and attack with it once. You'll feel much better about yourself. 

Round 5

Mother-fuckin Blood Artist deck.

Round 6

Blood Artist: The sequel. 

This Match... was more painful than watching Twilight with Kristen Stewart. 

I lost because I am bad and should feel bad. Valuable lesson to learn here. When trying to get your opponent dead

1-2

Round 7

Naya

I played against a Naya player. He was not prepared for turn four of our game two. 

Let's have a little conversation about primeval bounty. This card is fucking bonkers. It's never a bad thing to have in play. Only good things happen to you. It's what magical christmas land actually looks like. 

On the Draw
One: Forest
Two: Mutavault
Three: Mutavault

Four: Activate Mutavaults
Cast Hydra

Board after, 4 3/3 Elves, Kalonian Hydra, Scavenging Ooze with Rancor and 3 +1/+1 Counters. 2 4/4 Mutavaults. Bounty... The quicker-picker-upper. My opponent had a loxodon smiter.

2-0

Round 8

Junk Tokens

My opponent was busy casting lingering souls and I was casting resilient threats and then enchanting them with the popeye like powers of rancor. 

This list is sweet

There has also been some discussion about adding another color to this deck. Right now I like the mono green deck. I would cut new Garruk from this deck and replace him with another Relentless. I would give serious thought to changing the sideboard. 

The different color options are white and red. 

White: Rest in Peace and Unflinching Courage have been suggested. Ray of revelation is also under consideration. 

Red: Domri Rade and Bonfire of the Damned. Predator Ooze and Domri seems sweet. Other card to consider

Simple - Keep playing the deck.  
  
Junk 'Crats gets some new goodies that we can explore and abuse:  
  
1.  Archangel of Thune - With all of the Blood Artist triggers we have throughout a game, a reliable tutor target for the dark side of Garruk is nothing to scoff at.  
  
2. Xathrid Necromancer - I'm not sure just *how* great he will be in the deck, with Supreme Verdict, Bonfire of the Damned, and now Ratchet Bomb joining the party, this deck needs.  I would play 2.  My only hesitation is that it reduces our number of early drops against Aggro, particularly on the draw.  
  
3.  Scavenging Ooze - No 4-of by any means
  
4.  Disciple of Bolas - not a new goodie, could catch an opponent off guard, while giving us value through Blood Artist triggers.

I've been having issues with figuring out what to run in the sideboard. I've been thinking of going +1 Assemble the Legion, -2 Izzet Staticaster, -1 Counterflux. Although depending on how widely Aristocrats is going to show up, Staticaster may not be a good cut.

A few notes on the list that I've noticed so far.

Electrickery has been surprisingly good

Pillar of Flame has been underwhelming at sorcery speed. Pretty much the only thing it's killed has been mana dorks turn 1 on the draw. However I'm not sure what I'd replace it with. Perhaps +1 Mizzium Mortars

Izzet Charm doesn't seem to have much of an impact most games

From what I've taken from playtesting so far:

Naya Blitz: the matchup is pretty good even pre-board. Lots of burn to keep their creatures off

Junk Rites: this matchup doesn't seem too bad with Dissipate on their Unburial Rites or Angels and post-sideboard Clone for Angels or Thragtusks.

Aristocrats: I haven't gotten to play a ton of matches against this deck

Since Zombies aren't the boogeymen they used to be, which is a far better situation then months ago. Other cards are ineffective at best - Azorius Charm is rather terrible against Messanger or Aristocrat, the same goes for Devour Flesh or Ultimate Price. The only true creature threat is Angel of Serenity, though Slaughter Games can usually take care of it (which reminds me to put more into the Sideboard). If Naya Blitz has the nuts, you will probably lose, but that's not much of an argument. With Blood Artists, Vampire Nighthawks, faster decks than this one. 

While most of the deck is rather self-explanatory

- Searing Spear can be used to finish off your opponent while Dreadbore is amazing overall. 

- The mainboarded Pillar of Flame seem to be decent against Naya (killing Champion of the Parish on T1 is really important), it is a burn spell for two.

- Skirsdag High Priest has great showing in the B/w version and against some decks it provides a continuous supply of huge fliers.

- Bloodthrone Vampire is the B/r version replacement of Cartel Aristocrat in B/w. While it starts off as a 1/1 rather than 2/2 and cannot gain any sort of protection, the vampire's ability seems to me a bit more relevant in lategame even against a stabilized opponent. Just having a Gravecrawler, one more Zombie and BTV on the board presents a considerable threat for your opponent.

- Two mainboarded Vampire Nighthawks and one more in the sideboard

So what do Spikes think? Are B/r Zombies viable in the current meta?

http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/big-naya-02-04-13-1/

The deck is a basic Naya Midrange running just good stuff in it's colors, and post board Slaughter games and Rakdos's Return. These cards help some of our match ups significantly. So I have gone to making a list for this deck also. Here it is:

http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/dark-naya-07-04-13-2/

But do we need to splash black? Are adding the cards specified above really necessary? We could just play Jund Midrange/Control and already have the favorable match ups. Is jund really better?

**The Cards**

Naya:

* Thragtusk: Gains 5 life and is a big threat and can put the game out of reach for a lot of decks

* Restoration Angel: Has a lot of Synergy with Both Thragtusk and Huntmaster and the ability to flash in is very good.

* Huntmaster of The Fells: Gains 2 life and puts 2 bodies on the table

* Aurelia

* Thundermaw Hellkite: Good ability when entering the battlefield and can kill planeswalkers as soon as it drops.

* Loxodon Smiter: Stops aggro and can't be countered.

* Boros Reckoner: Can't attack into him.

* Domri Rade: Great Walker and it's pit fight ability with Boros Reckoner is really good.

* Garruk Primal Hunter: Great Planeswalker that puts out 3/3s and draws cards.

* Garruk Relentless: deathtouch wolves and Tutor Ability are good.

* Boros Charm: Saves us from Board wipes as is debated as the best charm.

* Selesnya Charm: Can Exile Angel of Serenity and Obzedat and is Faux counter to Edict spells.

* Kessig Wolfrun: Can take games.

Adding Black:

* Olivia Voldaren: Can end games and is hard to interact with. Really good against naya.

* Slaughter Games: Can name key spells agaisnt ceartin decks that can prevent us from winnining.

* Rakdos's Return: Can empty control players hands after a tapped out Sphinx's.

Round one i had no issues with naya. I get my turn two farseek, except i ult my garruk. 

Round two was a bit awkward. He had his combo going with misthollw and moorland haunt. To end game one, i bonfire for three, which got his three misthollow griffins out of the way, and swing for the win. Game two was no differnet, slam guys, bonfire his team. 

Round three was very similar to round 1. Kill his guys

Round four was against my roommate. I dont think i deserved the win i got, i kill hit. He misses his second land drop. I get the game shortly after. 

Round Five was a little rough. He gets game one with his removal plus thundermaw. Game two, he keeps a two land hand. I duress him, taking his rakdos keyrune. He misses the next land drop. I play dudes and when he has to tap out to kill my guys, i nail him with another big rakdos's return.

WE play out the game. He starts strong and fast. I stablize at one, then hit my thragtusk. The end of the game he tells me his last three draws are lands. We finish rather early, so i start scouting the other games out. One of my buddies also top eight'd with Naya blitz. I watch his game three. He was playing versus bant auras. He mulled to two cards and proceeds to lose. It was nasty. The head judge comes over to me and says that we can go ahead and play. I thought it was weird that we had to play, due to the seating. We start our games and he walks over me game one and repeats game two. I take my defeat with a smile and head to the front desk. One of the folks i rode with was finishing up some trading at the time, so i go over and watch the other top 8 games. As they finished, the TO tells me that i am actually not out yet. We had a mispair. I am extremely excited at this point. My top four oppenent sits down and we start our match. Our first game was a slug fest with misplays on both parts. I manage to pull out the win with a timed bonfire 'mircle. Game two is not too good for me. I keep a loose hand, a huntmaster and olivia. He starts with his mulches and grisly salvage and mana dorks. I miss land drop three and then he acidic slimes me, super tech Slayer of the wicked. I scoop up my cards shortly after. Game three, no resto angel

I've been running Bant Control for the majority of RtR standard. I top-4 FNM weekly with it

With the recent success of RDW and Bant Auras I'm expecting to see a lot of this Sunday. These are my current ideas to adjust for the metagame.

-1 Think Twice/+ 1 Supreme Verdict: RDW and Bant Auras are both extremely fast. I think it's important to nearly always have a Supreme Verdict in my hand for T3 or T4. Detention Sphere was first choice to cut but after thinking about it I felt its ability to exile enchantments if I don't hit a Verdict put it over the top of an additional card draw early.

-2 Psychic Spiral/ +2 Witchbane Orb: The control mirrors often come down to who can mill the other first. Psychic Spiral was my way to combat this

-1 Tamiyo/+1 Ray of Revelation:  Tamiyo is often brought in against midrange decks to shut down whatever threat they slam after a few turns. With the addition of a fourth Supreme Verdict I'm not sure this card will ever really be necessary. Adding a 2nd Ray of Revelation sideboard gives me more outs against Bant Auras

I took this to FNM last night, I only lost two games.

Round 1: vs. RB Aggro Burn

Admittedly

Round 2: vs. GW Aggro

I took one of my losses here because I misread his deck. He didn't draw well in game one, and I paid for that. Game 3 saw my Supreme Verdicts come in (I took Prosak's advice and put an extra one in the side board instead of a third Detention Sphere).

Game 3: vs. Jund Midrange

Fucked this guy up. The answers were always there for me in this game. He scooped out of frustration in Game 2

Game 4: vs. UWR Delver

I took this deck down fairly easily. I was able to counter his Geists at every turn

Game 5: Grixis Control

My other loss was here. I hit a clump of land in the first game. The other two games were fairly easy. In the second and third games, but he chose to remove counterspells and Restoration Angel instead of the Pike.

Overall, counters, and other spells is great.

**Primer on my list**

Reasons for playing Grixis:
        
I enjoy the win conditions more in Grixis, Sphinx's revelation, Detention Sphere, and Verdict. That being said, I think Grixis has competitive potential, and with proper sideboarding, can be successful in the current meta. I have had success against some American Control builds

Counterspells:

3 Dissipate
Dissipate has built-in graveyard hate and offers certainty unlike Syncopate, but took them out for the two Opportunity.

Removal/Bounce:

2 Cyclonic Rift - Gets rid of tokens, hexproof, tokens, and artifacts. Really helps against detention sphere/Oblivion ring/pithing needle, and populate decks.

4 Far//Away - 2-for-1 against tokens

3 Searing Spear - Standard burn

2 Mizzium Mortars - Can kill things like the Loxodon Smiters or Intangible Virtued Centaurs

Card Advantage:

2 Opportunity - Sphinx's for decks without white

4 Think Twice - Normal draw. Considering replacing with Forbidden Alchemy

2 Rakdos's Return - Gets rid of a full hand

Planeswalkers:

2 Jace, what's not to love?

1 Ral Zarek - -2 Helps kill things, -7 got 0 turns once but willing to try again

Creatures:

3 Augur of Bolas - Card advantage and a blocker against most aggro

3 Vampire Nighthawk - Lifegain

2 Aetherling - Win condition.

**Concerns**

I have some general concerns about the deck

On the other hand, and sin collector get, regardless of being removed. I don't have much trouble with B/W tokens due to Curse/staticaster/Jace, AoT. 

As for the lists I posted above

1. Should I go more counter heavy or more removal heavy? The Grixis Draw-Go runs many more counters than I do, Larsson's list ran only a few counterspells and mostly removal (also a Sire sideboard, which doesn't make too much sense to me).

2. Should I put in the 26th land? If so

3. What creatures should I be running. Nighthawk helps sometimes

4. What are the advantages of a Tapout list compared to the Draw-go style? What about having many 2-of removal rather than a few higher frequency removal?

5. Is Barter in Blood a good inclusion? What about Magmaquake or Mutilate? Rakdos Keyrune?

6. How many planeswalkers? What are the advantages of either getting more

7. Improvements to the sideboard? Suggestions for better removal (victim for example)?

8. Is Desperate Ravings a good card? I don't like the randomness of the discard

[Jedi Jund](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/jedi-jund-03-08-13-1/)

That's the current decklist I am toying around with.

As for the standard Jund list I was running... 
[Jund](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/jund-11-05-13-3/)

It's a pretty standard Jund list with Lifebane Zombies mainboarded.

I've basically been encountering issues with UWR flash and B/W tokens (Which I feel should be an easy matchup). 

Any ideas

I basically don't know what I'm doing wrong outside of lacking Lily.

With articles advocating Flash, how does Jund stay ahead of the game? 

  Jund's 75 was not a united front at all last weekend within the Top 32. What are the key must haves and glaring pieces requiring change when determining the industry standard Jund for the Invitational? 

  Topics might include the addition of Arbor Elf, Thundermaw Hellkites, and Scavenging Ooze numbers within the 75. 

  The more varying sideboards last weekend included Ruric Thar, Deadbridge Chant, Vraska, Golgari Charm, and Slaughter Games. 
Even more of an issue seems to be lists void of Pillar of Flame

1373776461.0,1i9cpg,[Modern] Scapeshift - burn match up help,atniomn,17,7,29,"Hey r/spikes

I play RUG scapeshift with primetime in modern

Against burn, I don't think it's worth having. Remand and Izzet Charm are also not super effective at buying me time, either. I don't know what else to have in my board for the match up, though. I have seen people play mana leak in the board for this match up, but I want to know if there are other options.

I have a lot of problems with the sideboard, which is played in my meta. Nihil Spellbomb is invaluable versus any GY based deck. Spellskite shuts down bogle and is a great blocker. Combust is the best answer for Colonnades. Torpor Orb is great versus both Twin/Pod. I have naturalize for blood moon, which is so obnoxious. The baloths are the only cards I am really unsure about, but what would I replace them with?

1372637419.0,1he7bv,[MODERN] Leyline of the Void in Jund Sideboard,georgejabbour3,18,5,17,"What do you guys think? 

The biggest thing is this kills any Melira Pod deck's combo element since Melira Pod is a big part of the meta now and it slows down Kiki-Pod by a fair amount. Also, any eggs players that haven't moved on (lol), Lingering Souls and other flashback, opposing Tarmogoyfs, any rogue zombie lists with Gravecrawler. And the Unburial Rites/Gifts Ungiven decks. Also Pyromancer Ascension/Past in Flames. Also destroys the fringe Living End deck going around. Also monoblue tron Mindslaver lock. 

Basically leyline shuts down 2/3 of the field.

Do you guys think it deserves 4 sideboard slots? I think it's the best graveyard hate you can have. I mean it's played in Vintage :P. And you can pitch redundant copies to Liliana of the Veil. 

So what do you all think?

Thanks

1372292873.0,1h595z,[Modern] loam!,Angelbaka,13,2,17,"So

The deck:

 loam! 

  // Lands 

3 Blood Crypt 

2 Buried Ruin 

1 Forest 

3 Ghost Quarter 

3 Graven Cairns 

2 Marsh Flats 

2 Overgrown Tomb 

1 Stomping Ground 

1 Swamp 

2 Urborg

4 Verdant Catacombs  

// Creatures 

4 Dark Confidant 

3 Deathrite Shaman 

2 Haakon

// Instants 

3 Darkblast 

3 Nameless Inversion  

// Sorceries 

3 Faithless Looting 

4 Life from the Loam 

2 Raven's Crime  

// Enchantments 

2 Seismic Assault  

// Artifacts 

2 Batterskull 

3 Engineered Explosives  

// Planeswalkers 

3 Liliana of the Veil 

2 Tibalt

// Sideboard 

SB: 3 Extirpate 

SB: 1 Ghost Quarter 

SB: 2 Maelstrom Pulse 

SB: 2 Spellskite 

SB: 4 Tarmogoyf 

SB: 3 Thoughtseize 

The choices:

Buried ruin: artifact recursion and selection from the graveyard. Better than academy ruins because no blue requirement and to hand means I can dredge without worry. 

Ghost quarter: I put three in the main because it's basically the only way I have to interact with certain decks (tron, etc) and it is in fact possible to use it as a modern legal wasteland for several matchups. 

Dark confidant:  Bob! Bob is always good. Average damage I'll take from him purely off cmc numbers for the deck is ~1.1.  Card advantage is supremely helpful at finding planeswalkers and seismic while still dredging. 

Deathrite: turn two Lili is good no matter what. Also provides much needed early life gain and helps make the mana ever so slightly easier. 

Haakon: recurrable blocker and hard to remove threat. Can be found and played with dredge. Also

Darkblast: one drop instant speed removal that lets me dredge three. Some of these maybe should be stinkweed imp? 

Nameless inversion:  see Haakon. Almost a recurrable bolt in this deck. 

Faithless looting: the best draw spell a dredge deck could ever ask for. 

Loam:  card advantage

Raven's crime: no

Seismic assault: combine with active loam for board-owning

Batterskull: finisher, I can do a lot of damage to myself), attacks and blocks. Very powerful here. 

Engineered explosives: board wipe of choice. Although it's theoretically possible to set it to five in here, this does. 

Lili: does work. 

Tibalt: in this deck

Sideboard: 

So most of the sideboard is essentially there to let me turn into a fairly standard kind of jund aggro. Spellskite is just a good card and can be recurred for value. Extra ghost quarter for tron and scapeshift. Extripate for the same plus combo. Maelstrom for tron and anything else too big/annoying to remove with assault/nameless.

I'm just not sure what axis I'm supposed to try to fight Jund on. Do I try to slow them down with Blood Moon and slowly roll out the combo? Or do I try to get the combo out underneath their removal and discard? If Blood Moon isn't the way to go what would be good SB slots against Jund?,t5_2utkz,True

The deck seems to be well positioned in standard. Predator ooze is extremely hard to get rid of and can easily fight Boros Reckoners. Lotleth troll is another card that can be an answer to the Reckoner and Planeswalkers seem to be good in standard against all control decks. The deck also seems to have pretty good matchups against both aggro and control which makes up most of the standard metagame.

1360775724.0,18gcnv,[Legacy] Dealing with Esper Stoneblade,buughost,14,3,30,"Hello spikes!

I've recently been getting into legacy play and I've been playing my mono-black pox resource denial deck([seen here](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/mono-black-pox-12-02-13-1/)).

A friend of mine is playing Esper Stoneblade, and the nether void has certainly  put a stop on him, but I'm wondering what I can do to deal with decks like Esper Stoneblade. 

I can generally keep the game locked down on resources pretty well, my choices are limited to say the least. Second game I do my best to force him to discard a stoneforge mystic, then follow up when possible with an extirpate.

What is a good way to deal with batterskull in this mono-black deck? He can return it to his hand at any time, pernicious deed and life on the loam. Thanks in advance!

**EDIT**
Thank you everyone for the advice! For starters it looks like I'll start by transitioning to BG Pox, BUG, or Nic Fit!
