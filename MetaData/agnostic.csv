---
If you're arguing that atheists have nothing to benefit from broadening their base and lumping agnostics in with them, and I'm just gonna have to disagree with it. If I were to make up my own belief chart, it wouldn't be binary, or have quadrants, it would be a venn diagram. Agnostic being the center circle, atheist and theist being the outer circles. Most if not all people are slightly agnostic in their views, meaning, but they also hold some doubt. That's why agnostic would be the center circle. Some people are hard theists, who are unwilling to concede that the possibility of a god is even remotely plausible. In the center, through and through. Some days I have inclinations that there is a creating force in the universe
I'll also add that it's logically incorrect to do what you're doing, and theist, and yet you're linking me to your own given definitions. If I'm to throw out my definitions, you have to expect me to then ask you to throw away yours.
Another thing to note, agnostic, and theist began changing, mainly due to the rise of internet atheism. It's not like any new evidence has come out to disprove God. The same logic is still used, by an large, and yet, the definitions have changed. I won't assume that it is an attempt to broaden the atheist base, I won't deny the plausibility of this being the case.
I want you to look up what has happened recently in regard to NDT's wikipedia account. Whoever first wrote the article included that he was an atheist. NDT saw this, so to speak. I'm no NDT, but you're kind of doing the same thing to me right now.

It seems to me that the vast majority of atheists and agnostics become this way because they resort to *pure* reason when constructing their beliefs. Of course when you erase all religions from your frame of belief

I'm completely agnostic. I still haven't really been able to decisively lean one way or the other on the god vs. no god debate. However

Now, the life stops. It's done. Almost *every single* atheist or agnostic I've ever met seems to have the belief that death is death, and there is nothing but eternal emptiness devoid of thought or existence. This is where my belief splits off.

Alright. You're just gonna have to bear with me on what I'm going to explain

Okay, is that really true? What makes me ""me""? What separates me from my father, from my dog, from that tree, and from a rock? We're all matter and as far as humans go, we're all VERY similar. So again, what makes me ""me""? In my view, and is comprised of many different tenets such as identity

The birth and development of a human is a remarkable way to create and foster this system of information that I'm calling a ""consciousness"". There could be other ways of creating a consciousness. In fact

So, there exists a system of information. Perhaps it's atoms interacting in the hot core of some asteroid. Perhaps it's intergalactic particles roaming around colliding with one another. Or perhaps it's even in a supercomputer developed by some post-human civilization. What's *special* about this particular system of information is that it's EXACTLY similar to your consciousness the MOMENT that you died. The biological mechanisms of your Earthly body may have failed, but that does not mean your consciousness just needs to stop. If this system of information is sustainable (unlike the human body), then your mind would continue on into the afterlife. There's no reason that it wouldn't! We have no reason to suspect that consciousnesses are tied to any particular point in space or time.

I think that i don't ""know"" if there is a god. I haven't met him or anything like that. But i see the possibility for a god or gods. I also see a possibility that everything is just simple coincidence or we are just in some sort of simulation like the Matrix or anything else you could think of or couldn't. I think all of the possibilitys are possible and they are so at the same percentage of chance. So with my knowledege right now it makes no sense to choose one of them over the other. If i ever find proof for one or the other i will become a believer in that theory. For example if would meet a god or whatever i probably become religious. But i would never start believing just because someone tells me that there is a god or we all live in the ""Matrix"". I need to decide for myself based on my own experiences and thoughts.

2. An average person trusts experts in a field to explain scientific evidence as true
3. The average person believes in most aspects of science that they can not personally test only because they have read it or been told it by a trusted source
4. The way the average person takes this belief in is similar to the way early man gained ""knowledge"" of religions. They were told that things happened because of magic and believed the trusted source.

Now let us look at the average religious person

2. An average christian trusts experts in Christianity to explain Christian issues
3. The average christian knowledge of christianity is not from personal research

I've always lived in a devout Christian area, feeling everyone else get that spiritual high - when they're uplifted and feeling hopeful - and all I could feel was a sense of intrusion, because I didn't fit into their community. Not really, anyway.

Then I went through a period of anger. I hated anyone and anything that was remotely Christian. I hated it/them because I could never be part of their group, I bashed Christians and arrogantly proclaimed myself an atheist, thinking that *anything* was better than being Christian. Even I didn't understand that frustration and loneliness were at the heart of my actions.

And when the fire to hate other people for being happy finally died away, that I was an anomaly in my community - an anomaly in my family. The rest of my family is Christian, though admittedly all different denominations. Yet they all have something in common. Me, I've just gone through my life trying to figure out what I believe. I've been trying to make myself act ethically according to my own standards - and failing miserably. I looked into Buddhism and Taoism, trying to find something I could absolutely agree with, and found nothing.

Then I found this subreddit by accident. I clicked through some of the links, because I'm so unsure of what my feelings are doing. I've spent so long feeling lost and alone, and now I find that's not the case. I've been afraid of being spiritual, because I didn't know how.

There was a time when learned intelligent people scoffed at the idea of dinosaurs, of germs, of atoms, of every possible thing that we now know is true. I think to suggest that what we currently have proof of is all that is true shows a folly that is in opposition of the scientific process.

By insisting there is no possibility of such a thing, you believe something that isn't true. Something that in 50 years, people will say ""Oh my god, can you believed we thought that XYZ was true!""

1347724373.0,zxgkj,I am an Agnostic enrolled in an Old Testament Survey course at a Baptist university--here are a few of my thoughts.,Rockfiend,47,8,13," I am Agnostic, my professors have been extremely open-minded and view the Bible as a human-made compilation of stories like most legitimate Bible scholars do.  In the first week of class in both cases the lectures were about how the Bible is inconsistent and how it should never be involved in science or politics.  This certainly was not what I was expecting to hear.

 The reason I am posting this is because I have learned a lot in these courses.  I have learned that both Christians and non-Christians have elevated the Bible higher than it should ever have been.  The people who put the Bible together knew that it had inconsistencies because they purposefully put differing perspectives next to each other so that readers could compare and contrast (consider the gospels).  It is only in recent history that people are expecting the Bible to not contradict itself or it isn't valid.  

 Bible writers never cared about accuracy.  All they cared about was getting a point across and they did that through storytelling.

 It saddens me that there is such a stigma associated with the Bible.  Although the courses have not deterred me from my Agnostic viewpoint and there are definitely things that turn me off about the Bible, much like we study epic poems or ancient mythologies that are also based on oral tradition.

Firstly, even though I've misplaced them many times.

There's a certain grey area between how probable a believed fact can be before it can be considered knowledge. I think the nonexistence of deities is probable enough to be put into this class of things which can be considered knowledge.

Based upon what I know about the world, there is absolutely no physical or mathematical law which can prevent there from being an elephant in my dad's house. I even know elephants can exist. However, to say I'm not without some knowledge would be a perversion of the word agnostic. 

Based on what is known about the universe

I also don't think my position is faith based as it is often accused of being here. It's derived purely from reason. I don't consider myself to have a horse in the race of whether there is a god or which it might be. It's kind of like how based on what I know about my parents

I think the debate about gnostic atheism vs agnostic atheism vs agnosticism is more of a debate on what constitutes knowledge than on the beliefs or lack thereof themselves.

I'll answer one quick objection before you guys comment:

* But with a potentially infinite amount of unexplored universe and a potentially infinite amount of potential gods or deities

There are a potentially infinite amount of numbers too. Even without exploring each one of them

Religion was an attempt to pin down the Divine. The Divine was eternally in flux, true enough: absolutely mobile. Absolutely transcendent. Absolutely flexible. Absolutely impersonal. It had its god and goddess aspects, but it was ultimately no more male or female than it was star or screwdriver. It was the sum of all those things, but that sum could never be chalked on a slate. The Divine was beyond description, beyond knowing, beyond comprehension. To say that the Divine was Creation divided by Destruction was as close as one could come to definition. But the puny of soul, the dull of wit, jealousy, our prayers would have bored him to death long ago. 
The Divine was expansive

And I seriously almost cry when I see how much it has done wonders  for my family and my happiness. I'm a lot more happy and less stressed because of the no arguments. My family has back off from trying to reconvert me (something that was kinda annoying me) and let me run my course.

&gt;Imagine you are in the middle of a vast ocean, but it's missing that spark of life, it's missing water. Now if you dip that cup into the ocean, you have now filled that vessel with the breath of life, with a soul, with a small piece of the consciousness. Now this body is full and can go about its life. But with life comes death. The cup has served its purpose and it is now time for the soul and the vessel to part ways. Thus the cup is shattered and is gone. But does the water float off into space, never to again join the ocean? No, to share its own unique experiences with its fellow consciousness.

&gt;To answer your question, there is the chance that some of the water used before will be in that cup. All consciousness is meant to be used and recycled, used and recycled, all for what I believe to be the great purpose of life. My personal belief is that all life exists to experience life itself. The consciousness is a thing, and like all things it wishes to survive and prosper. The best way to do that is to gain experience and knowledge. That is why it send pieces of itself to gain this experience and knowledge, so that it may thrive, survive, the world of the living.

This goes for any of the major three monotheistic faiths.

Sure, greek mythology seems silly in essence, but I just can't 100% disprove anything in the universe.  For all I know, I still cannot prove it does not exist.  But regarding the popular concept of ""God""...I just can't simply say I believe or not.

Hi r/agnostic!

I am a panentheistic Catholic and ex-agnostic

I hope for polite discussion, I only hope that my reasoning is novel for some of the members here, and that maybe I can offer a different perspective. 

Anyways

**What follows is my latest iteration of my argument for the belief in God. It is not a proof of the existence of God. This cannot be proven. It is however proof that if one accepts a certain premises then one has a belief in God

**Operational Definitions**

*Objective/objectivity*: existing independently of verification; existing independently of any subject: existing necessarily.

*Consciousness*: awareness

*Subject/subjectivity*: dependent upon another for existence; dependent upon verification; contingent.

*Experience*: having a subjective perception of...

*Perception*: an object of consciousness

*God*: an objective consciousness

*Reality*: the physical universe as understood by science

**Argument**

&gt;1. If and only if (IFF) an objective consciousness (God) exists

&gt;2. We experience an objective reality

&gt;3. Therefore

This is undeniably a valid deduction. The conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. Therefore

The argument can be refuted by refuting either of the premises (1 or 2). Premise 2 (we experience an objective reality), it is illogical and irrational to deny 2. To deny 2 is to deny science. A denial of 2 is a commitment to solipsism.

This leaves us in a position where

To refute 1 we would need to prove that the existence of an objective consciousness (God) is either a) unnecessary (only if) or b) insufficient (if) for us to experience an objective reality.

However

&gt;1. We only directly experience (A)consciousness; all experience of (B) reality is within our experience of consciousness. *(theory of mind; indirect realism

&gt;2. A cannot prove the truth (objectivity) of B unless the objectivity of A has been established. *(Descartes, therefore I am, and by the objectivity of my being I can prove that my experiences are real. Without establishing that I exsist I am unable to prove the existence of my subjective experiences)*

&gt;3. Therefore

&gt;4. Consciousness cannot prove the objectivity of itself (circularity) though neither can the objectivity of consciousness be doubted. *(Descartes)*

&gt;5. That which is not susceptible to rigorous proof can only be believed. *(definition belief)*

&gt;6. That which cannot be doubted must be believed *(definition self-evidence)*

&gt;7. Therefore, believed, but it cannot be proven. *(from 4, 5, 6)*

&gt;8. Therefore, 3, 7). (this proves that the necessary condition is met. Only if there exists an objective consciousness do we experience an objective reality; one MUST assume the existence of an objective consciousness to believe we experience an objective reality, regardless of whether we are cognizant of the fact we are making this assumption)*

&gt;9. If there is an objective consciousness

&gt;10. (1 in the original argument). Therefore, 9)*

&gt;QED

So this is, I think. it is irrational to assume that I am the objective consciousness (that I am God) because I cannot manifest reality with ""my"" consciousness (it isnt mine I only experience it directly), and it is illogical to think solipsism is true because all evidence suggests that reality is objective and other minds exist. This leaves us in the position of accepting the existence of a transcendent and objective consciousness which manifests and sustains the reality we experience, i.e. God, if we accept that we experience an objective reality. 

I am kind of hoping for just some respectful comments and critiques of my argument

Cheers.

Obviously yes, but that doesn't mean that the model is the right way to think about things.

No matter how factually accurate that is, but that each persons does not scan very well to the next.

I view agnosticism as largely

I claim agnosticism not because of lack of judgement or conviction

So that is why I am agnostic, just as highly as they value their state of 'confirmed' knowledge.

The brain is such a complex thing, and study it; we can only study the brain when some one is deceased. So I thought about this long and hard and  came up with a philosophy that many people may either agree or disagree with. So during life, we come to believe in God(s) just for the pure fact that we need a sense of security, like when you die that there will be ""paradise"" or something like that. Like it or not, this is a clear fact because we do not surely know of any higher being. But to me, when someone dies, their brain's last final function may be compiling what the person has believed during their life religious wise, and they've believed their whole life that ""heaven"" is in the clouds and you will see all of you dead loved ones, and the person is forever in that world. Think of it as a huge simulation the brain is putting on. Another example, and I had to share this with somebody. Please tell me what you guys think

Wall of text incoming!

I'm a 19 year old female who used to be a Baptist. I didn't start attending until my freshman year of high school, this was a big deal for me, and I started going to youth group every week. My pastor was awesome, my friends there were welcoming, and I was becoming more confident in myself.

Towards the middle of my freshman year, calling me fat and ugly, and at one point stopped hugging me because of a verse in the bible his neighbor told him about that says, ""It is good for a man not to touch a woman"" (I believe it's in Corinthians somewhere). Of course I was hurt, but I thought it was normal (I was very naive) and then one day he dumped me out of (what I thought) the blue. He continued to send me menacing messages on facebook, though, causing my depression to worsen and eventually my dad got involved. He never bothered me again after that

Fast forward to the end of my freshman year. My dad was arrested, searching for answers, trying to work through my depression, and now to try and find forgiveness for my dad (which I did--we've always been best friends and although it was hard at first, I love him to death). 

Because my parents saw how much I depended on the church

The first thing that started to get me thinking that maybe church wasn’t all it’s cracked up to be was during one youth group where the topic of homosexuality was being discussed. Thankfully I’m WAYYYYY more open minded now, two of those friends were at youth group that night, where my pastor basically bashed the gay community, called them sinners, and told us that it was our duty to pray for them to not be gay. Obviously, my two friends didn’t come back to youth group.

Some of you may think that that experience should have been enough for me to leave, almost brainwashed at this point. But I was happy, and my parents were happy, and I thought church was a good thing. And then the three of us decided to become members.

Before I go into this

Anyway, etc. it was time for us to become members in front of the Sunday morning service. However, a week before it was supposed to happen, the deacons pulled the three of us aside because they didn’t think it would be good for church politics if my dad became a member because of the shit he was going through with his trial. It had been three years since everything had happened at this point, and he had been attending church for almost two. We all thought, of all places, the church would be most forgiving. Apparently not.

After that we stopped going to church. I could no longer believe in a god whose followers treated their fellow human beings like the church had treated my family. There was obviously a lot of unhappiness in the hearts of these people who said that they were always filled with happiness

Since then, in prison. I couldn’t bring myself to go back. I have, however, started becoming more spiritual lately. I want to believe there is something out there, whether it be a higher being or just nature in and of itself. I want to believe that someday I’ll find true happiness within myself and within the world.

TL;DR: Started going to church in high school

Growing through my teen years, to government, to religion... I began researching politics and government, mythology and religion, science, music, and many other fields.

Upon researching mythology

Upon researching religion, I found some convincing and doubtless holes and stories that just made me say, ""This religion can not be true..."" You know, even the church leaders say not to look up anti-mormon doctrine. Being naturally suspicious, I began thinking, ""That's probably because they're afraid we'll discover it is impossible and untrue.""

Science has always made so much sense to me. Sure, the creation of planets and stars. It all just made so much more sense than an invisible man taking some dirt and making a man, then taking his rib and making a woman, and light suddenly appearing cause he said for it to appear, and simply making the earth in 7 days. Satan also doesn't make sense. Chemicals in the brain determine our emotion, our thought, our everything. There is no man whispering in our ear to do evil. Same with the holy spirit.

So I have determined, and to teach people to behave. And don't get me wrong - I respect religion. It brings people happiness and joy. But I have also seen the dark side of it, as we all have.

But I can't tell my parents this. They would be shocked. Truth is, but obviously, I don't want to do something for a cause I don't believe in. I would rather move on with my own life. But I don't know what to do or say. So I'm coming to you, reddit, for advice.",,False,t5_2qjrd,True

I had avoided the the roundabout and saved costly damage to my cars steering rack. I didn't think this was any type of miracle nor did I praise the heavens, I  just thought good reflexes and a little bit of dumb luck saved me. So I filled up my tank, and went back home without thinking anything of it. 

Upon arriving home, ""Uhhh no Mom, I can drive, I don't run into inanimate objects."" My mom then said, ""Oh huh, cause when I was napping I had a dream where my mom (so my grandmother, who is deceased) told me to tell you to never ever do that again and she saved you from the curb.""

Here's an example as to why I think the default conclusion should be to disbelieve it.
There is a chance that there could be a completely undetectable dinosaur in your bed right now. You have no reason to believe it and you have to reason to think that there isn't

1342317406.0,wkpgq,Why I reject the common agnostic chart and my proposed solution of a better system,GGTeMpLaR,29,10,48,"A few years ago I remember adamantly arguing that agnosticism was actually compatible with atheism or theism on many occasions. As of recent though

I've come up with an extremely simple and clear alternative that relies on two simple statements and their logical negations (based on Universal and Existential quantifiers and their negations in Symbolic Logic). The new system I propose is in stark contrast with the currently accepted chart of ""http://i.imgur.com/s2m7D.png""


The new system is comprised of an argument of four simple statements as seen below:

(1)Statement: It is the case that I believe God exists.
(2)Negation: It is not the case that I believe God exists.

(3)Statement: It is the case that I believe God does not exist.
(4)Negation: It is not the case that I believe God does not exist.


I will argue that Theism


Theism: Holds statements 1 and 4 to be true.
(1)It is the case that I believe God exists.
(4)It not the case that I believe God does not exist.

Agnosticism: Holds statements 2 and 4 to be true.
(2)It is not the case that I believe God exists.
(4)It is not the case that I believe God does not exist.

Atheism: Holds statements 3 and 2 to be true.
(3)It is the case that I believe God does not exist.
(2)It is not the case that I believe God exists.

A simple and messy chart I have made will make it easier to see:
http://i.imgur.com/6Wixe.jpg


TL;DR ~~~~~ IMPORTANT~~~~~
The chart and entire definition system is based on three assumptions. I believe unless you disprove one of these assumptions, and will prevent numerous debates of semantics that arise from the alternative graph.

i) If one argues statement (3) to be true

ii) If one argues statement (1) to be true

iii.) If one argues neither statements (1) or (3) are true


Again

I was brought up to believe in very religious values and to follow the bible. I only recently joined a youth group at my church and we had a retreat sort of thing called catholic heart work camp. It was mostly a volunteer opportunity. It sounded fun and I thought I might grow in my faith from it. 

We took a 4 hour trip to the location. We were bunked in rooms in a catholic school that was on summer break. And had some free time before the afternoon mass. A buddy of mine and I started to talk and the topic lead to religion. Now we both had been sort of questioning what our beliefs were and we connected deeply on the subject.

We brought up how we thought the church was a little hypocritical with some of its values. One thing that we both didn't agree with the church on most deeply was the topic of homosexuality. God loves everyone right? That's what the church says

Throughout the weeklong camp my friend and I further questioned our beliefs. One day the camp had a ""religious deepening experience"" planned for us. What this was was an amount if time set aside where we could reflect on our faith and talk to the priest and other patrons and what- not. My friend decided to talk to the priest about what he and I had been thinking throughout the trip. The priest was unable to answer questions about what we didn't like about Catholicism and tried to get my friend to not talk to anyone about what he was thinking about. He also told my friend to never draw anyone else away from the catholic faith. My friend was very distraught

This experience was life changing to me. I finally felt right about what I believe and In my personal faith and I made one of the best friends I had ever had who happens to think nearly the same way I do about the subject.

I do) beliefs tend not to come up in conversations.  I gave him the common answer, saying that there's not enough evidence on either side to believe in the existence of a deity or not.  He claims that since there is no (cue the magic word) **rational** proof of a god, the default belief should be disbelief.

Now, this guy is very large and intimidating) and said ""Well do you have any proof for there **NOT** being one?""

He pretty much blew his shit and started going off in the middle of the sandwich shop, if this 'silly' and 'unbelievable' religion is so absurd, then how do you explain the millennia of belief by people?  I'm not saying God exists or not, but even people from 2000 years ago had brains.  And the bible isn't known for being completely morally sound, but it says that Israelites struggled with their faith, and their god showed wonders to rekindle their belief (paraphrasing.  Some were harsh).  I'm not citing that as proof either.  But something kept these people believing, whether it was real or imagination.  The only thing is...you and I both know that we don't know which it is.  So you can't claim you know there isn't a god

If the answer is yes, completely ignoring even the slim possibility that one's logic or interpretation of reality is flawed. The term ""agnostic"" would apply to almost everyone because no one can claim, with absolute confidence, that they are right. The term ""agnostic"" would be meaningless because it would apply to almost everyone. Calling oneself an ""agnostic"" would not provide any information that constructs an individual identity because the description ""agnostic"" would fit almost everyone.

If the answer is no, while the people who were the most gnostic would be the ones who claim to be almost certain of their beliefs, accepting only a small possibility that they are wrong. Knowledge and Belief would be no different, or at least knowledge would be nothing more than strong belief.

To briefly explain my present situation:  I grew up going to church, I think my mind mostly didn't contemplate bigger questions of existence, etc.  And if I ever did, it always came back to the answers that were provided by my church having to deal with God, heaven, salvation, and all of that.  So
  
I am now in my late twenties, but at the end of the day, I think the most sensible conclusion that I have reached at this point in time is to call myself an Agnostic.  I realize that I simply don't know.
  
Although this deeper contemplation of existence has been positive in some ways, or moment by moment.  It is even kind of silly to me, but the thought that keeps churning in the back of my mind is, ""you are going to die someday, and you will no longer exist.""  It's kind of like the opposite of being suicidal, if that makes any sense.. it's like I get incredibly afraid of death because I enjoy life so much.  I feel the weight of the fact that life ends and we do not know what comes afterward, if anything.  Then, happy life

So I make a quick phone call to my Dad (who was smart and divorced the crazy bitch years prior) and my Girlfriend at the time to come help me grab stuff. I was gone before she even came back from church.

Whenever I go on /r/atheism or talk to my atheist friends, no logically and scientifically they're sound. I'm talking morally. It's so frustratingly annoying how I'll talk to them and one minute they'll be talking about how they don't need god to care for one another and next thing you know they're bragging about how they completely ""dominated"" in an argument someone JUST for having different beliefs than them.

Then you get the religious people... the thing is that it seems to be only a sense of... how do I put this... it seems to only bring a sense of peace at mind at times, but to what extent is it truly ok? It honestly just isn't exactly appealing. 

The thing both have in common, correct?

Yes, I understand, ""Mikeyoyo, it's just not that easy"" I get it. But actually think about it. Either accept that you're both argumentativeness hypocrites or talk it out and then one will actually show the truth.

I'll try to keep this simple:

The last few years

However, the first land-based organisms would live in the dirt. Considering the Bible was written for an unintelligent people, maybe this was the author's way of explaining man's origin without detracting from the value of the Bible?

In both attacking and defending the Bible

One thing that turned me on to theism (It's not a strong point, right? Yeah yeah, big bang yadda yadda. But hold on: how did time start? What happened before time began? Was there a time before time was time? That wouldn't make sense, because if time is not time, then the time before time was time could not be a time. (May have worded that correctly?) This would suggest something that was not bound by time created time. (A creator of reality wouldn't be bound by that reality.)

Anywho, I ended up with monotheism, because polytheism contradicted itself like no other. (in my study, at least) Assuming there is A god, then which is it? I had narrowed it down to Islam, Judaism, and Christianity. I noticed they all accept the Old Testament. And from my studies

So what? A prophet existed. Big deal. Eventually, too. Judaism v. Christianity began. If we take the prophecies word-for-word and literally, Jesus does not fit the description. However, if we look at it from a broad sense, He does. Eventually, I decided Christianity was my belief. Okay, what next?

We ALL know contradictions exist in the Bible. In r/atheism

I'm not here to convert people, if at all possible. I'd love to hear both sides of the story.

(Also, I don't believe birth control is evil, and I don't believe non-Christians are damned. I believe that IF God exists, and He is benevolent, He will give all a second chance at judgement. Otherwise, it would be unfair and unjust.)

Thanks for your help! I look forward to answering questions and having my own answered.

     There are points I feel both parties refuse to acknowledge. Atheists don't seem to admit or realize that religion teaches morals and serves as a form of government in its own community. At its bare minimum, however, constantly defend their religion and tell people they're going to hell if they're non-believers, which is ineffective. Pretty sure atheists won't really fear something they mock and don't believe in.

The church seems pretty open, but were very anti-gay and promoted the American Dream.  I am willing to be able to identify that and walk away and to treat the experience as a positive learning experience.

__________________________________________________________________________

Well

I was raised in a non-denominational Christian church my entire life, and just ""believed"" because it's what my family was doing (it's funny how much sociology in involved with religion). I was raised to believe that we ""shouldn't question"" things and just ""have faith"" that God controls everything. My mother always used Biblical references in raising me, and I grew to secretly resent the Bible's teachings.

As I grew into my preteen years, and lack of support from my family were all factors to this. At 12, I ""re-found"" God and things started looking up. I took comfort in the fact that ""someone out there"" cared for me. I became a really devout Christian from ages 12-15.

At age 16, but tried to convince myself that dating outside of my faith was really bad for me to do. But one day, I took a chance and dated an agnostic. I made him agree (before we started our ""relationship"") that he would respect my beliefs. Well, that ended after a week. He called me crazy for talking about God like he was a real, living person. After that, I decided that dating anyone outside of my faith was never going to happen again. I (stupidly) put all ""non-believers"" under the label of being disrespectful people. Until...

My senior year in high school, since he always seemed to shy away from discussions about God. I tried to stop myself from liking him, until one day, I just gave up and let myself have a major crush on the kid. Turns out, he was an atheist. When we started dating, I was still kind of believing, but more-so doubting my faith. Things like discussions in my Comparative Religions class and how my church started preaching about ""the evils of homosexuality"" were what really chipped away at my belief in God.

I started becoming scared, and I felt alone (""My entire family is made up of Christians."") But then I began to think... even if God existed, why would I want to ""serve"" a God that has killed so many innocent people (as it states in the Bible and now in modern days)? What God of love would allow such terrible things like that? Why should I believe in God if my only reason anymore would be to avoid hell? (I could go on and on about everything I don't like)

But anyway

______________________________________________________________________________

Now I am over the ""fearful"" transition of becoming an ex-Christian, am ready to live my life and then die when my time comes. I wish I could convey this feeling to my loved ones, but I feel as though they would just ""not have it"" (my new beliefs).

In my view buildings like churches and all the complex ranks people have within the Church (and institutions like it) seem a little... unnecessary. 
Do people really need them? We give off quite a bit of tax money to the institutions plus they already hoarded a lot of property and wealth throught history which could be used in other better ways.
I'm not against them believing in any religion of course
If they can't do it without structures because of ceremonies can't we just maybe maintain the already existing structures and build some more here and there if needed? Can't they come and pray

In reality it is very simple to see how evolution can create human intelligence and how it can create self-awareness.

In the case of the incredible achievement of human intelligence [there are many good theories](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_human_intelligence) and possibly most of them can be combined

[Ecological dominance-social competition model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_human_intelligence#Ecological_dominance-social_competition_model): Basically, social, able to organize others against others, was more likely to be naturally selected. This explains also all the human vs human strife in history and why animals basically have more to fear from nature than from their own species.

Now, as a part of a machine, and it's not really a Soul that does it or a divine power that is planted into us.

But, it must be aware of its own importance in the decision making process. It is not just a variable, it is what must survive along with its companions.

One can go further that and go beyond the thought process: the whole nervous system in organisms, and the fact you have a brain that can calculate that, it doesn't mean it's that much different from a basic organism that was hurt.


In any case. the point I'm making is, unless one sees atheism as a religion, which is silly, but it's very, very, difficult to see a high probability of that existing when in reality, for such an afterlife to exist, then why not simpler machines? Why not dogs and cats? And why not simpler machines? Why not birds like parrots? Why not even simpler machines like insects or bacteria? And in the end

You look up ""theism""--
Wikipedia: ""Theism, theism is commonly a monotheistic doctrine concerning the nature of a deity, and that deity's relationship to the universe.[2][3][4][5] Theism, in this specific sense, conceives of God as personal, present and active in the governance and organization of the world and the universe.""

Definition of deity--
Wikipedia: ""a supernatural being, or sacred.""

I have called myself agnostic for a while now because I cannot refute a non-religious

Wikipedia: ""Agnosticism is the view that the existence or non-existence of any deity is unknown and possibly unknowable.""

If a deity is considered to be a supernatural being created by religion, theism, agnosticism in the first place? I did not see anywhere in any of the overviews anything about a higher power type--just deities. Are we all diverting from the real issue at the root of it all--religion?

Now, or if so many of us are arguing while being on the same side.
I apologize if my writing is unclear--I wrote this in a hurry.

EDIT: Td;lr--According to the wikipedia article overviews for ""theism"", it seems to me that atheism disbelieves in deities created by religion and not a higher power. Agnosticism says that deities are possible. If this is true then I cannot be agnostic spiritually and I can call myself an atheist while admitting that I cannot prove the existence of a non-supernatural being that has nothing to do with religion to instigate the big-bang. Opinions?

EDIT 2: I think some people are misunderstanding my post or I am not being clear. I am not getting hung up on words...when I read these article overviews, ""if it's only about religion, then there is no way I'm agnostic."" According to those article overviews, I am a staunch atheist. I am the most anti-religion person I know and I have been researching how gods are created by religion for the last couple of years. Since I have identified as agnostic for a long time, this was a little of an odd feeling to me. I began to wonder--if it is all really just about religion, then a lot more people would be atheists. When I looked up Agnostic on Wikipedia, it said that Agnostics believe that the gods created by religion could be real.  That is not me by any stretch of the imagination--it can be shown that the gods created by religion are false.  But when you use agnostic as a descriptor,"" then me and a lot of atheists would probably use it for many unknowns in the universe. One of these unknowns is the catalyst for the expansion of the universe

Look, Atheism, and Agnostic are...and I definitely had my own opinions. I usually go to Wikipedia for a quick reference and it turned out that most people don't agree with their definition, but it is the one that makes the most sense to me. I will probably never tell someone face to face what my ""label"" is, but it is important for ME to know. I have felt a kinship with both groups, Atheists and Agnostics, which is why I subscribe to both and why I find both sides to be compelling perspectives. I think where most of us would staunchly agree is that religion is the problem. That is where I am drawing my boundaries from now on,,1370954216.0,t3_1g1wz0

Some of you define gnosticism as a position of KNOWLEDGE, because I know Spanish but then I could also be a Swahili gnostic, because I know Swahili exists... well, I don't truly know as I have no first hand evidence, but I believe people who claim it to exist and other second hand evidence.

So applied to our Agnosticism

Agnostics are not about knowledge of the existence of god

I'm going to explain the subtle but important difference.

A typical ""chartist"" (guy who believe in the agnostic/gnostic/theist/atheist chart) will tell you crap like:

* If you KNOW there is no god but you BELIEVE there is no god then you are a Gnostic Atheist.

* If you DON'T KNOW there is a god but you BELIEVE there is a god then you are an Agnostic Theist.

But they will never tell you what happens if you truly deeply don't know WHAT god is.

A definition of god includes its existence. Let's go about one of the staples of e-Atheism: Atheists love to compare the Christian god with leprechauns. What is a leprechaun? A leprechaun is a MYTHICAL little dude that has gold and does not exist. Atheist do not compare God with say

Where am I going with this? Well to the conclusion that the definition of something INCLUDES whether that something exists or not. 

Chartists define gnosticism as a position of knowledge about the EXISTENCE of god, keep pushing them and they will have to come to a definition then you will find up they basically share some form of definition that is compatible with Christian fanatics, an ""omniscient, omnipotent, etc... being"", with the only exception that the atheist definition adds the ""mythic"" attribute to it.

In that sense they are already lost (or found? or saved?); incapable of being agnostics. They have decided on a definition of god to believe or disbelieve. They KNOW.

Now by this point if you still read me you are going to give me the link to Ignosticism in the wikipedia, the true spirit of agnosticism is pretty much compatible with ignosticism always: we don't know what the word 'god' means, we don't know what god is, and some of us BELIEVE we may never KNOW.

You just noticed I mentioned a chartist agenda. Sounds like tin foil hat crap but it's not. It's very human, it drives the internet, we live with it, why can't we conceive it? Throw away your definitions.

So in sum

* Do you KNOW what god is but don't believe it exists? You are an Atheist.

* Do you KNOW what god is and believe it exists? You are a Theist.

* You DON'T KNOW what god is and you believe it exists or does not exist? You are lying to yourself: you can't believe or disbelieve something if you don't know what it is.

If you DON'T KNOW what god is and you can live with that then you are an Agnostic.

And I'll end with a funny cliché:

Agnostic atheists are agnostics without balls :P

I was born and raised in a christian family who attended church every week.  Somewhere around 16

We followed up and said we would be attending my home church but decided to do so before his card.  He then followed up to her reply with an even more religious email.  He did this all behind my back and he barely knew my GF.

I unloaded on him and made it clear that he needed to accept and respect the both of us for who we are despite our religious differences.

She is not your best friend at all; in fact, if you run into her she quickly becomes your enemy. This is all she has ever known after all. 2 years of living like this, lives like a king

Through all of this, because the 20 years on Earth weren't spent living the righteous path she was never offered. Perhaps she was reincarnated into a tree, perhaps her lungs are filled with liquid fire that flows through the very bowels of hell, or maybe she is pierced daily by the elongated nails of demons.

I apologise if these examples are too crude, scientific, mathematical models of it, but it is something that even though we attest, escapes our full understanding. I am even agnostic about the complexities of economy; I doubt we can ever understand it in a concise and intuitive way.

Those examples are purely personal. I don't think it's impossible for some people to fully understand the flow of economy but I just find it unlikely. It is I who doubt I will ever really

I find that this way of thinking helps me delve deeper into those topics and maybe the theological conclusion is just a consequence of thinking about the world in an agnostic way. To me agnosticism starts with the humility of accepting I just don't know.

The logic goes that here is a point where

While the internal logic of this point is valid I have trouble when this applied to the concept of a ""creator"" or ""higher being.""  Basically the problem is that for this logic to be valid you have to have some basis on which to determine any relevant probability.  For the tea pot we have no historical record that anyone launched a tea pot into space and for santa clause I personally left presents under trees enough to know what is actually going on here.  But where is the actual physical reasoning on which you can make any probability claim about a creator?  What is the experiment/observation that supports either decision?  The only physical evidence that would oppose a creator is that we dont see one as far as I can tell.  Is that really it ?   Cause I don't find that very convincing and it definitely doesnt even approach the same level of certainty that the tea pot or santa clause analogy would imply and I find it extremely frustrating that people seem to think that it does.  It isnt that there is a 50/50 chance because that would imply some basis for determining this 50/50 chance.  There is nothing on which anyone can make any evidence based claim about the existence of a god so we can make no claim whatsoever !

Also a certain area in the basement was extremly colder than the rest of the basement, and the dogs would always avoid that spot.

I believe there are three main Principles in Agnosticism that truly help define our group of individuals.

**LOGIC**

I was always raised a Presbyterian Christian which tends to be a more Liberal sect of Christianity. Now

**EQUALITY**

The only idea we were hard headed about was the fact that Jesus loved everybody no matter their religious affiliation, or socioeconomic status. I always treated everyone as an equal. This, I believe, was the reason I find making friends pretty easy despite my slight social awkwardness. 

**TRUTH**

Be honest to everyone was a huge part of the church I attended. ""The Truth shall set us free"" was a huge point. Whether it was with your parents

Now granted these Principles were found in religious dogma

Science classes started to make me question the validity of the facts presented in the Bible. I soon realized what the Bible along with every other major religious text was at least in some distorted way

**The One Superior Being Thought:**

(*inspired by [this picture](http://brain-buster-puzzle-pack.brainfunctionz.com/images/brain-cell-and-the-universe-3.jpg)*)

Our entire universe is the single brain cell of a superior being.  Our entire existence is a passing thought of this being.  Our universe was created when his/her cell was created.  Our planet, conscious or subconscious, of this being.  When they forget something, it dies.  When they die, so will our universe.

Take it a step further... we are the superior beings to the universes in our own minds.  By that notion, Westeros is real... just on a different level of existence.


**The Reincarnation Thought:**

(*inspired by [Final Fantasy VII](http://www.finalfantasyunion.com/charimg/screenshots/bugenhagen-solar-system.jpg)*)

We learned from The Lion King about the Circle of Life.  ""When we die our bodies become the grass and the antelope eat the grass.""  but what makes our dead body different from our living body?  The energy it has fused with it.  You can say a rock has energy when it moves, or a bit of water, and became life.  When the energy within us separates from the matter we are made of, we die.  Our matter decomposes and spreads everywhere - it is decomposed by bacteria, eaten by insects, fertilizes grass, feeds other animals

Like our bodies, it becomes other things - the wind, lightning, or even energy to your home computer.  A part of it may even infuse with other energy to become a living being - a sapling, a puppy, or even a baby person... thus, granting us rebirth.

Of course, since our energy spreads everywhere like our bodies, we do not wholly become another being, but only a bit of the energy that once dwelled in us would then be in another being, making them a mixture of all sorts of energies which came from all sorts of different paths.

I believe in science

The conversation / questions asked are ones I'd like to have / ask with a religious person who has an open mind...

The concept starts with a simple question - if a delivery man delivers a parcel, delivering the delivery man?

Most religions believe God is everywhere, action or reaction. Take a deck of 52 cards. The scientific probability of picking any card from the deck is 1 in 52. So in theory, if said person believes in God, shouldn't he guide their hand to a specified card?

Religious person says maybe. Atheist says no.

The book highlights a point - if you flip a coin 50 times
Religious or not, most coins are not equally balanced, the heads side is slightly heavier, making tails very slightly more probable.

Actually, yet questioned so easily, then how much do we really know about the reality around us?

Building on this

r/atheism did highlight if the sun, why would any God design a system so flawed? Along with the appendix and wisdom teeth, among others.

Now, spanning time and space. So, I now know the outcome of mankind, and when man reaches that penultimate plane of existence? Then what? Do it all again? This is akin to a director making a sequel movie with the exact same plot. What's the point? This isn't some show someone's watching like Big Brother to see what we do. 

A point I'll add here - we don't know we're not some experiment inside a dish. To us

Back to the God argument, really boring. So why start at all - why do anything, if everything is pre determined by your hand?

Science is the body of activities and knowledge gathered from observation.  Whenever I'm discussing religion with people, which we (scientifically) have proven to be flawed.   Science is also based on certain axioms that we hold to be true without having proof for them.

Other than being internally more consistent, then continuing to refine that model until everything fits. 

I tried using faith here, political or personal motives by their thoughtleaders and scriptures.

can you help me bring some order into this?

TL;DR what makes science better than faith? Can you disprove a deity?

I was never told an acceptable answer but nonetheless continued believing Christianity is the “right” religion to believe in. It wasn't until recently I started to really think about what I believed and the reasons behind it. Partially because I’m not sure what I want to teach my newborn son as he grows up. And I haven’t really discussed this transcendent view with my wife or family

Some people say “X” religion is the only way to get to heaven all other religions are wrong and will not reap the benefits of “X” religion because they are non believers. So basically they are saying religion is like betting on a religious roulette table and if you loose

Some say you get to some sort of heaven for doing the good things of “X” religion. Wouldn’t the best way a human could prove themselves worthy, Quran etc…)

Some people claim there is nothing more than what we are and all people of religions are ill-informed. It is possible

If this dimension theory were true (it could be, so how could one claim with 100% certainly, nothing higher exists, be it God, Buddha or what/whom-ever?

I don’t really like the term “agnostic” to describe how I rationalize it all. I consider it more of being religiously transcendent.

Does anyone else feel this way? Any thoughts about any of these points?

______________

in the beginning man wondered to himself

why oh why are we here

and yet with each asking of this question

the answer would become

even less clear

.

overwhelmed by fear

distraction took its place

and so it was

in the world’s first shelter

that we began

the human race

.

the human race to fill up

more and more

empty space

.

oh how we love the human race

.

till one day this one guy said to this other guy

he said “hey have you seen that guy over there?”

“he’s got more than everybody else has got “

""to me that don’t seem fair""

.

the second guy agreed with the first guy

everybody else did too

till they all got so worked up

they figured there was something they just had to do

.

divide his things up among each other

*after they killed him of course*

so they could see no real good reason not

to just take what they wanted by force

.

but when they found him he said

“hey wait a minute fellas”

“i wouldn’t kill me just now”

“you can see that i’ve got more than any of you have ever got”

“wouldn’t you first at least like to know how?”

.

and with that he had their attention

and with that he went all loud and clear

he said “y’all know how long we’ve all wondered”

“why oh why are we here?”

.

“well today i’m gonna tell you all about it.”

“i’m gonna teach you about suffering and bliss.”

“i’m gonna teach you all a little about heaven and hell

“and the god that gave me all this.”

.

“god gave me this.”

.

“because i’m humble. and he can do the same for you too.”

‘but if you’re seeking his love and affection

“what you’re doing is the last thing i’d do.”

.

“he sends killers to hellfire.”

“both here and eternally.”

“the good live forever in a place called heaven.”

“god told me this personally.”

.

who you gonna trust in?

you can’t trust me

.

“so unless you want suffering and heartache”

“unless you want trouble and fear”

“you better find some kind of way to humble yourself man”

“i suggest helping me clean up around here.

.

“of course i could pay you a little bit of money

“more importantly - god would see.”

“and if he sees you working humbly

“he may give you what he’s given me.”

.

well the crowd just didn’t know what to do with that

nor could they prove what he said wasn’t true

and since he had what everyone else thought they wanted

it seemed like a thing to do

.

and with that we roll into the future

**and ain’t it a son of a bitch**

**to think that we would still need religion**

**to keep the poor from killing the rich**

.

who you gonna gonna trust in?

you dont trust me

We can't be sure there isn't a god or that there is.

This is due to the nature of god. If he was an all-powerful being surly he could hide from us.

However we can say the god of the bible does not exist. 

This is backed up by the old argument written by Epicurus around 341-270 B.C.E
Is God willing to prevent evil

This fully disproves the biblical God. 

But let’s not be rash god could exist. He could just be an entity that created the universe and just watches it progress with no interaction.

Maybe he judges us but at no point interacts with us. 

This is why it is a stretch to say there is no god because the possibility of a god that leaves no proof exists.

Personal experiences of mine have been emotional, just living. No matter what, I have either been aware of living my life as though I had a mission and other times where I appeared aimless. TODAY, I am in a place as I have been for the past 4 months or so, where I am aware that I am not *hearing* nor feeling the active presence of any spiritual entity. So the label agnostic atheist *seems* to fit. 

But one final CLAIM I wish to make is that **I have not rejected any of my [former] beliefs**. They were valid for me in their own time. They are part of me no matter what. I find my conclusions, rippling to fade. I have observed patterns in my life of such obsessions almost manic, followed by periods of flatness, almost depressive. I have never been diagnosed bi-polar nor have I ever written like I have today. This is the most honest I have ever been with myself. I have lived duplicitous for fear of rejection/condemnation, have rationalized, have treated myself chemically (substance abuse/alcohol) have been a fanatical athlete, been back to my Catholic roots and many other religions throughout my life. I know in my *heart* the I am good; that I am grateful for my loving wife and my current circumstance.

Today I am fully aware that my belief system is ambiguous and non-committal. Does that make me wishy-washy with no credibility? I don't think so. I think it defines me as a seeker who still hasn't found what I am looking for or something that truly fits. I am nearing the end of my 5th decade of life. I am doing my best to accept myself as one who's convictions change like seasons. I give myself permission to do so.

I've read a few posts on this and other similar subreddits (eg r/TrueAtheism and r/agnosticism) recently

I define supernatural as something beyond the laws of nature, because it breaks rules that I have seen proven; it's supernatural. However, I can imagine that, with a comprehensive understanding of the human being and the right technology, it would be possible to deconstruct and then reconstruct a person flawlessly to 'teleport' them. This does not break any natural laws I am aware of.

Not all definitions of deities require them to be supernatural, the Christo-Judean god and the Muslim god to be supernatural. Given this, I not only do not believe in these gods, I believe that they do not exist. If anyone gave me reason to believe these gods are not supernatural I would stop believing that they don't exist (although I would not believe that they did exist until someone gave me reason to).

When I was about 19 years old I still lived at home and we lived in a major city in a not very nice area. We did not have a powered garage door so to park my car I would need to drive through the alley, but felt that needed to be explained. Anyways, this ""voice"" was different than my typical inner monologue and it just felt urgent and blocked out whatever other teenage thoughts I had. So I grabbed it, walked to the garage door with the machete in my left hand and as I bent down to pull the bar holding the door open in place a man suddenly stepped around the garage door. In a very quick moment, he looked at me, looked at the machete which I unknowingly was holding in a ""ready to chop some limbs"" way and then he backed off and ran down the alley. It happened faster than I could process and I didn't fully understand what just happened until after I closed the garage doors. 

I still think about that from time to time and occurred to me to ask on here and see some other opinions. Was it some type of instinct kicking in or what?

atheist - agnostic atheist - agnostic - agnostic theist - theist - religious


People often say that it requires no belief to be an atheist, and would claim that theists and atheists both make assumptions, or ""beliefs"", about our universe.


I hold my ground on the basis of intuitionistic logic, in which we do not accept the law of the excluded middle.


That is, and we are to discover where each statement lies.  If we show the statement does not reside in the space of falsity, it must lie in the space of truth, even if we cannot show it does.


However, we must be able to prove the statement actually resides in ""truthiness"" or ""falsity"".  It does not suffice to take a proof that it does not reside in one, as a proof that it resides in the other.


Those are a lot of words


From the wiki on intuitionism:

""If a statement P is provable


In application: Take P to be the statement ""no god exists""


Apply the second sentence of the quote to this statement.

No disproof of P is possible

We only show that there is not not no god


To be strictly atheist


This is a little confusing with so many negatives.  But I hope it is interesting to you.

1375967788.0,1jyc27,"In regards to the definition of ""agnosticism"".",theforshizzalist,3,1,22,"So I want to find some common ground here. I have been thinking about the classic argument between atheists and agnostics on the definition of atheism and agnosticism. I sympathize with both and I'm not even sure how to properly define them

I am an atheist myself and I think there is common ground where both atheists and agnostics acknowledge that gnosticism and agnosticism deal with knowledge only and not belief. But agnostics get rustled when an atheist claims that agnostics are atheists too and I completely understand why. At one point in time in my search for answers I held no stance in any direction. I simply did not know and was searching for answers and the best way I knew to describe it would be ""agnosticism"" but it didn't feel like a complete description to me. Sure

Both atheists and agnostics can be a bit stubborn when it comes to this. I think there needs to be an extra term that agnostics go by because you can be a theist or an atheist and an agnostic at the same time. While atheists like to widen their definition to include those who lack belief (as opposed to active disbelief)

So while the traditional ""atheist definitions"" look something like this:

               Theist
                  |
                  |
Agnostic --------- Gnostic

                  |
                  |
              Atheist


I think there needs to be some term added on that is completely neutral in regards to any of these stances. Because if theism is the assertion that there is a god, which is what ""agnostics"" are. Because if gnosticism is the assertion that you know, agnosticism is the assertion that you don't know. While the latter holds true for people of this subreddit there is also a neutral aspect here where people do not make a stance one way or another, because of their agnosticism. So instead of including lack of belief in the definition of atheism, I think there needs to be another term that describes the lack of belief. If you can be an agnostic theist, or an agnostic atheist, then you can be an agnostic something or another

The issue is

I believe that science and anything related is a very small slice of 'reality.' I like to divide it up into three general sections. Religion

There are a magnitude of subjects which are not/will never be explained or researched by science. It simply isn't designed for some things.

What of the subjective reality? Science is by definition focused on objectivity

And the biggest issue is that I'm a theist.

Having to defend myself from accusations of basically 'not believing in evidence and thus believing whatever I feel like' is a pain. I have no trouble with logic, I believe in the virtue of science and I use science in my day to day life.

But how do I relate to people what my actual position is? Does anyone have any nice non-woowoo concepts about uncertainty

for instance,000 years ago so that humans would develop technology' (just a random example) and then, even though I disagree with the premise, I can extract valuable information from the rest of the argument.

1:Examine your current beliefs. No matter what you previously believed. Read Your scripture from cover to cover (If you already have done this sorry

2 Consider your ethics and try to understand where they come from.. 
You may want to read books by Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, and Carl Sagan They are all associated with atheism. 

3 Study various forms of theism. It is important to thoroughly understand your former faith and its tenets as well as those of other faiths. The more versed you are in other religions and the more you understand why people believe what they do

You may want to read books by Joseph Campbell and Karen Armstrong.
My personal favourites is The Power of Myth and The Hero with a thousand faces...

This universe is vast and immeasurable, and saying that something is impossible is just stupid to me. While I'm 99.9999 percent sure that there is no god, I'm still open to the possibility of it being true. I believe in maintaining that open-mindedness  because if I don't, I'm just as bad those close minded religious freaks who only see the world their way and everything else is just bullshit. This doesn't mean YOU Have to maintain this open-mindedness because another of my core beliefs is that EVERYONE is entitled to their opinion! Who am I to change YOUR belief? Who am I to say YOU'RE wrong? Thats why I don't tell my girlfriend to not believe in god, that's why i don't even tell my parents i don't believe in god. I know so little in this universe

The reason I am not atheist yet is because (1) I LOVE the idea of a God (2) I really don't see any conflicts between science and the bible. (I have come up with a multitude of thoughts and theories in my mind that I am not ready to share with the world yet)

**ANYWAY** argument is not on whether there is a God or not.. It's the fact that despite my eager naive mind, someone who will love us unconditionally. However, until I know my prayers are being heard and I get some vision, or several radical prayers are answered, i will stay at the end of the road, hoping for an extension of it to be discovered.

Anyway, I can always sink into my agnosticism, a middle point where untruth and truth are balanced finely, waiting for one side or the other to tip. I find comfort in this stasis.

To try and explain my views I'm going to use Reddit as an analogy. Nobody knows how Reddit was created, you may believe it was a higher power, or a scientific theory on how it was created., but as it stands we do not know how the world came into being. I mean if it was God, why did he suddenly come up and decide to create the universe?

Reddit grows, and begins to improve itself. Just as we humans have, growing brinGing the world to what it is now with advances in science, medicine etc.

The majority of the world are good human beings, and such is the case with reddit. Most people will browse the site, provide funny and insghtful comments, but your also going to get people who lie on Reddit and spread hate and force their views upon people.

This is how I see the world, decide that being an asshole is the way to go.

Then we get to Reddit's karma system. A user posts something

In comparision the the real world, or people who believe it's wrong.

This leads me to my final point, regardless if you know them or not, you will have the same happen to you. Doing this provides that feeling, that feeling you cannot describe where you have performed a selfless act, whether it be paying for a strangers coffee, or providing an organ for a complete stranger. It is this feeling, which is religion, a higher power. It is this feeling of and act you have performed that you cannot describe to anyone, and there is a reason why we feel like crap when we hurt someone

This is why I believe we are here, to do well and help others, whether it be family, friends or strangers. This is why I believe there is higher power out there, for whatever reason he created he, he installed this basic into our human nature. and providing this amazing feeling, when performing these selfless acts. It is of course down to your free will

This is why I don't feel I am agnostic, because I feel you CAN make positive assertions that you DONT have the means to test for, in fact, science is precisely based on hypothesis and looking for positive confirmations, not falsifications of arbitrary statements.

1352008648.0,12lolz,Through Buddhism I have finally realized the Judeo-Christian God and where our society has lost Him. (x-post),gigglefarting,3,4,0,"Just a little bit of my background. I was raised Jewish, and has inspired me to read a few books. I am no scholar or expert in either religion by any means

So now onto this God guy and where the problem is with him and our society...

The crux of the problem is the fact that God is seen as a super natural being. But the word God is just a label, it takes on properties that might not necessarily define it. And this label has transformed through the ages to take on properties of the super natural. It's not super natural. It's super nature. All of nature. Everything that exists in the universe and the nothingness that's, well... nothing. Through philosophy class I was able to attach the basic properties of the Judeo-Christian God: omniscience, omnipotent, and omni-benevolence. But at the same time, we're quick to say that there's some OTHER, super natural, I've become aware that these are all attributes that can describe ourselves and nature if we drop our ego/mind and allow nature to happen.

Omniscience - People say that God knows everything. He has all the answers. He knows what I'm going to do tomorrow. But I'm starting to think that we shouldn't be looking at it as if you know all the answers to everything already, then you already know everything. In a meditative state you don't ask, ""why is that tree there?"" You only observe the tree with complete awareness and accept it as is. Complete acceptance transcends you past a state of questioning. The mind asks the questions, but the body already knows everything it needs to know.

Omnipotent - If we can get past the concept that God is a super natural being, and will ever happen happens in nature. Men are part of nature, so even things we do and create are created in nature. Like I said before, God is not some super natural being that's external from our world. He's not a guy with super powers that is here to save the day for you. He is the all encompassing, so when you take away the super natural properties it only makes sense that nature has the full power of nature.

Omni-benevolence - God is all good and all loving. People's natural state is all good and all loving. True, but it does separate you from everything else. Your ego can drive you to give to charity, but the ego is what wants to take credit for giving to charity. Selfless acts aren't ego driven, and that should be obvious since it's right there in the word itself ""self less."" When you sit and lose your ego, only becoming aware of everything around you, you'll learn that the void your ego leaves is filled with love and compassion. There has been brain scans on meditating monks that has given scientific proof of this concept. It is within all of us to tap this power, but it does require dropping the ego. But once you drop the ego this power fills up everything. We are omni-benevolent if we allow ourselves to be

To feel the presence of God is to feel the presence of everything and the presence of self. To be completely aware of nature. And this can only be felt in the present. Only right now you can drop your self and become all knowing (or should I say no longer questioning) and all good

There are 2 questions I remember from philosophy class that have been used to prove the inexistence of God:

1) ""Can God create a rock so big that even he can't lift?"" and
2) ""If God exists

To answer the first question. If we realize that it is not something super natural but all of nature the question then becomes illogical. It's assuming that there is something OTHER than the lifter and the lifted. If there is an other force it is the nothingness or just pure consciousness that connects us all, does exist, and it will unexist, and the rock would not be anything different than everything that already is. Hell, planets are big rocks, and what's holding those up?

As to the second question, or something else? If it's physical pain then pain is also part of nature, and you can't attribute the labels ""good"" or ""bad"" to pain. Sometimes it's a defense mechanism and saves our lives. The point is is that it exists, and because of this it's part of God as it's a part of all of us. Some people even enjoy this physical sensation and it's not ""suffering"" at all. Now we can attribute suffering to what the Buddha was getting at and it's this desire that things aren't as they are. So suffering exists because our ego gets in the way between our body and what is God. Pain is not suffering. Pain is God. It is the ego/mind that suffers. The reason why there is suffering in the world is because we choose to suffer and not choose to feel everything as is.

But once you realize all this
The God that our society views is nothing more than a manifestation of people's egos. People take all of their fears, which is only pushing their own ego, their own fears and desires, onto others. People have asked me quite often if I'm afraid to go to Hell? And I can only laugh because I choose not to believe in such a place. If anything, Hell is the mind/ego, and Heaven is the body. Why do people want to wait till they die to live in bliss and peace when we all have that ability to do so right now on this planet.

The weird thing is, Judaism, Buddhism, Christianity, Islam, etc.. But inside each main category there's different sects as well. But the weird part is that those are all monotheistic religions, (with the possible exception of Buddhism, you can see where the root sprouts and understand. By dropping one religion you can gain a concept of all religions. Then organized religions just become a set of laws.
