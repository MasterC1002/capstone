You can see a ""normal"" animated sitcom like American Dad one second, the more absurd episodes of South Park notwithstanding.

Even better, that’s still to this day the only animated show they’ve ever broadcast with both story arcs and real character development that follows the model of a traditional drama. When Tom Goes to the Mayor premiered in 2004, there was nothing close to it on the network. It was jarring visually and tonally, but it opened up at least some segment of the audience to a new type of comedy. In 2007 they let a show try something no other show had, obliterate it's own tried and true formula, when they broadcast Moral Orel’s “Nature” and the subsequent ultra-dark seasons that followed it.

I can understand distaste for some of the shows Adult Swim has aired. I honestly can’t stand Loiter Squad, what you’re really saying is that you hate experimentation, you’re saying you hate what makes Adult Swim great and what separates it from the rest of boring TV. 

If you want to live in the past like Fry did when he found the anchovies can then you’re welcome to drop those sweatpants right now, and look forward to what they have in store for us in the future. Now if you don’t mind, I've got another episode of Off the Air to watch.",,False,,t5_2r5tw,,http://www.reddit.com/r/adultswim/comments/1h8ctb/from_assy_mcgee_to_the_xtacles_variety_is_what/

Your audience is more loyal than crack addicts... reward our dependency with more shows like:
* Sealab
* Venture Bros
* Harvey Birdman
* Oral (edit: Moral Oral)
* Robot Chicken
* Home Movies

I know that most of the production teams for the above mentioned shows have gone on to bigger things... good for them. But that just leaves more room for more talent. OC is the spice of life.

You used to have one of the best streaming video sites out there. Long before hulu or even Netflix watch, set a wonderful standard, and made it so I didn't have to torrent your shows from myslpeen (remember them, adultswim only tracker from the golden days of bittorrent). 

Hell

Then, pages took forever to load, and the amount of ads skyrocketed. I thought it was ok, but then you stopped uploading new shows promptly, first it was just or day or two, but then it went up to 3 or 4 days, or even a week. 

What the hell adult swim? What happened to your internet video service? Now I have to wait weeks to get new content. What caused this unnecessary update? I could stand the ads, I have no interest in your content and i have returned to finding my adult swim fix through illicit means. 

I want to support you, hard to use, and never has new content. I'm returning to the torrent world for my adult swim content and you are losing ad revenue, or whatever it is that you gain from my viewership. I wish I could support you, I really do, but I just can't wait for my shows.
