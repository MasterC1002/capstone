**EDIT 322: 7:43PM** He is on the boat.  Center mass is leaned towards the fence line.  He is inside the stern - or maybe the gastank is inside the stern.  Half full tank with 20 gallons of fuel.  Unsure if the suspect is trying to get to it.  
**EDIT 321: 7:42PM** Confirmed movement in the boat from multiple sources.  Confirmed movement in the boat.  
**EDIT 320: 7:40PM** There is a full tank on the boat.  20 gallons of fuel on the boat.  Helicopters overhead say there is movement in the boat.  Asking for spotlights on the boat.  
**EDIT 319: 7:40PM** There is quite a bit of movement in the boat.  He is sitting up and moving.  
**EDIT 318: 7:39PM** SORRY!  It wouldn't let me make a new post in /r/news so I had to make one here.  I don't know why.  
**EDIT 317: 7:32PM** They are working to meet up around the back of the house.  They almost have the top of the boat ripped off.

I could barely wait until this evening to dig up my buried treasure.  I had pondered opening the letter before going to work


http://imgur.com/a/73ft8#0 


http://imgur.com/a/aT8NL#0 


http://youtu.be/-AYUVFZdcEU




The results:


Step one was opening the letter to myself.  To my surprise, but without the aid of a metal detector I would have been digging for quite a while.


The search only took about 15 minutes thanks to my friend Mike and his metal detector and due to recent rain, Ziploc brand bags may not survive the apocalypse. 


The box was, sorry.  This one won't be on the auction block any time soon.  It was badly deteriorated and rusty but you could still make out some characters and the General Lee.


What was in it?  Well, but I'll try to provide a bit more detail here.  


The first item was the NY Yankees hat.  This is the one article I remembered being in there.  It was a gift from a fellow fan that lived in NY.  He bought it at Yankee stadium (along with a few others) and sent them to me.  This one was badly faded though so I never wore it.  The cotton on the hat had long ago rotted away.  What was left was the nylon bill and strapping that holds the hat together.  


On the bill of the hat I found a barely recognizable picture of my family.  It was a family portrait of my parents


There was also a plastic card holder with four Don Mattingly cards inside.  I was a huge Mattingly fan in those days


That's it.  I'm fairly certain that I had written myself a letter


Thanks for accompanying me on this adventure!

TL;DR - 13 year old me was a troll ;-)

This is an update of [this](http://i.imgur.com/edFu0.jpg) picture. [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/wp10x/settlers_make_fun_of_the_palestinian_woman_after/) are the reddit comments. And [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/wp10x/settlers_make_fun_of_the_palestinian_woman_after/c5f7v9x) is my comment that stirred some nice conversation that I enjoyed greatly =)

ok. So this update is an attempt at giving a lot of information. The picture gave very little information

I'd like to add, but it definitely is not 100% positive. 


**BACKGROUND INFORMATION**

*Sheikh Jarrah*- Sheikh Jarrah is a strip of houses in East Jerusalem that used to be Arab owned. In August 2009

Before you yell at Israel for being racist or an apartheid state or whatever, and took them to court. It made it up to the Supreme court, and they ruled that the Arabs were correct. They forcefully evicted the Jews, and now the Arabs live their happily. 

So before you condemn Israel for evicting Arabs; just know that they evict Arabs, whomever. They evict those who they think legally don't own the land. 

Anyway, like they did in Ulpana, they allowed them to pay rent and stay. Some of the tenants refused to pay rent, so like any tenant who doesn't pay rent, they were evicted. But some of the families stayed. 

So it was at that point that this picture was taken. When a bunch of the houses already had Jewish families in them

*Jerusalem Day*- Jerusalem day is a modern holiday that was established to commemorate the day Israeli captured The Old City of Jerusalem in 1967, Sinai Peninsula, East Jerusalem. (On a side note, Sinai and Gaza were both given back in exchange for a promise of peace. Both in Sinai and in the Gaza strip, there were Jewish communities that were forcefully evicted by Israel). 

If Israel got a bunch of places back, even if it wasn't the capital. Jerusalem is the heart of the Jewish people, and has been for thousands of years. We pray every day to be able to come back to Jerusalem. So logically, when we DO have the ability to come back to Jerusalem, it's kind of a big deal. It's the first time, since it was owned by the British, that a Jew set foot into the Old City.

So how does Israel commemorate Jerusalem day? Well, continues down Jaffa street and into the Jaffa gate of the old city. The parade continues to wind through the Jewish quarter of the old city (as opposed to the Arab, Christian, and Armenian quarter). The parade ends with a giant concert at the Western Wall. 

Due to the simplistic nature of the day that we are celebrating a victory, and Arabs who are pissed of at these people. 

**ACTUAL STORY BEHIND THE PICTURE**

So obviously

&gt;Ya I know it. I've seen this picture. This isn't the first time that it's popped up on reddit. It's false propaganda. The guy is clearly a good photographer and caught our faces (mostly mine) at exactly the right second. The truth is It was yom yerushalayim [Jerusalem Day] and we were singing in a part of yerushalayim [Jerusalem] that was recently resettled by Jews [Sheikh Jarrah]. Singing and celebrating. And the Arab woman came out banging with a metal stock on a pot trying to interrupt out celebration so we were just raising our voices and singing louder as she came into our faces. We were not screaming at her or mocking her. We were just trying to continue our celebration that she is trying to interrupt. And what's not show in the picture is a few more women banging on pots as well. She came to us. We didn't move at all. In fact

&gt; recently resettled by Jews

I'd like to comment on that part of his email and explain a little. Remember what I said above about what Jerusalem Day was celebrating? That Jews were once again allowed into Jerusalem? So logically

moving on.

ok. So this is a little better, that obviously this is a two sided issue, that I only have one side for. I wish I had the Palestinian woman's side but, unfortunately, I don't. So yes. I'm giving a VERY one sided view, and just know, that I do understand that.**

Anyway. So I emailed him back and asked a question:

&gt;if it was Jewish

(at this point I haven't researched Sheikh Jarrah yet. 

his response:

&gt;I think only part of it was resettled by Jews. We took a tour of a house there and went on the roof that overlooks the whole area and then went down sang and danced. That's when she showed up from behind a fence across the street protesting. 

So here he goes further. That the women was behind an enclosed private area

So I told him that I was going to make a post like this

&gt;A big response to anyone can be, the Arab media wasn't only taking pictures. They were also taking video. So we can turn around and ask, why is there only one still shot picture with a caption? Must be 1) they only caught our faces in one bad pose for one second because we really were singing and dancing and 2) they can't release the video because that will reveal the truth, that we were singing and dancing. But if they take one picture and distort it with a false caption, they capture the media. The video and all other pictures were probably destroyed. 

I personally think that those are valid questions. Am I right?

Anyway. In summation; according to this kid. They were singing and dancing, meaning she was the active one, they didn't actively seek her out. She was banging the can trying to protest the celebration, and they didn't stop, and the picture was snapped. 

Again. I give this from a strictly one sided view. That doesn't mean that it's wrong

If there's anything that needs to be clarified



**tl;dr** they weren't mocking her. They were celebrating a holiday and she approached them banging the metal thing protesting their legal celebration. They continued to sing and dance as they were doing prior to her intervention. No harassment.

Here is what I figured out. I added the lines

Here is how I got 418. Using the Zodiac Killer's code (see above), the second integer, aka after the [:], is how many times it occurred in a row. The totals of these numbers, with their appropriate positive or negative attributes, gave me a subtotal for each line. These subtotals, also both positive and negative

Line 1: +22:5, +1:1; +22:10, Line 1= 0

Line 2: -187:1, +22:5, -419:1, +22:5, Line 2= 0

Total is + 418 (From the sum of individual lines' totals.)

Here is some of what the Wiki article says about Abrahadabra and 418:

""ABRAHADABRA has 11 letters ABRAHADABRA = 1+2+2+1+5+1+4+1+2+2+1 = 22 The five letters in the word are: A, the Cup; H, the Sword; R, the Rosy Cross; and refer further to Amoun the Father, Thoth His messenger, and Isis, Horus, the divine-human triad. Also 418 = ATh IAV, or Ra Hoor 418= הרו-רא-הא, which = 365 [10] 418 = 22 x 19 Manifestation""

Notice the 22x19=Manifestation

*Edit:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_square

If you add the numbers (not the differences
The number .4641 happens to be a constant multiplier in mathematics (equal to dividing by the constant

This does in fact seem to be a ""circle squared"" (not that that really means anything).

EDIT: I looked up the 800+ pg. FBI file where this magic square was from. Also in there were a couple of photocopies of detailed pictures of someone practicing Thelema (robed magician sitting in a pentagram

I looked up every older alphabet I could find, it has its own alphabet—and a very ambiguous one at that. Thelema has two alternates for every letter, and uses pictures. Many of the pictures matched up to the Zodiac's.

So I have spend at the least 3 hours with Comcast tech support explaining my issue. I would say about 15% of my total calls have resulted in someone who isn't reading troubleshooting lines off of the F.A.Q supplied with their job. Just about every employee wants to tell me that they see no interruptions in my service over the past weeks and the connection is working fine now so they can't help. That or they want try and troubleshoot my hardware. I have tried to work around this by using the XFinity live chat


This shit is not acceptable Reddit, and it's impossible to play video games, did I mention it's impossible to play video games? I CAN'T PLAY VIDEO GAMES WITH MY MOTHERFUCKING ONLINE FRIENDS. What's the big holdup with Comcast replacing amplifiers? Why is that such a huge fucking no-no that the company has to give you the run around and try blaming the problem on your hardware constantly? A quick google search confirms there are about a billion other people with this issue. Scumbag Comcast doesn't give a fuck.

PS - WHERE DO I POST THIS TO?

In the 2000 presidential election, I voted against Bush and went for Kerry.  Neither time did I think ""Hey, my guy lost.  I don't like the guy who won.  Well, guess I better petition for *MY STATE TO LEAVE THE FUCKING UNION*.""  

Seriously America?  Fucking seriously?  First of all, you lost.  Take after the 8 year old little league kids who lose - you suck it up, get a soda and a slice of pizza, and get the fuck over it.  Lastly, welcome to fucking America.  Where the majority wins.  Just because you're in the minority doesn't mean you need to run away crying.  What you need to do, if you're that opposed to the other side winning, is make sure your team gets the popular (and electoral) vote next time.  And, then the *majority* of the country obviously doesn't like your team's platform.  Just because the Giants beat the Pats in the Superbowl in 2012 doesn't mean that the Pats and their fans are leaving the NFL and going to the Canadian Football League.  What are they gonna do?  They're gonna work harder and try to win next time.

Jesus fucking Christ.  I am so angry at the so-called ""patriots"" who think America is a sham when their candidate or idea loses.  Get the fuck over it.

Oh, and now you're mad b\c Obama won, too fucking bad.  If your god is real (who\whatever you pray to), and you believe that he actually listens to prayer and does what is asked of him, then obviously he put the right person in office - even if that person isn't the one you had in mind.  Obviously, your idea of the ""right"" candidate isn't your god's idea of the right candidate, which means (if you're a faithful, not your god.

-
Dear Friend
 
Thank you for contacting PETA. We appreciate the opportunity to address your concerns.
 
PETA is on the front lines in the battle to help unwanted dogs and cats. Our caseworkers work tirelessly to rescue homeless animals from environmental dangers and situations of cruelty and neglect (http://www.PETA.org/about/learn-about-peta/community-animal-project.aspx). Our staff members crawl through sewers, and dodge traffic in order to reach animals in danger. During floods and storms, we are out saving animals’ lives at all hours.
 
PETA does not run a traditional adoption facility; we are a shelter of last resort. While a few of the animals we take in are lost companion animals whom we eventually reunite with their grateful guardians and others are taken to local open-admission agencies where they will have a chance to be adopted
 
Because most people take healthy, euthanasia is, without a doubt, the most humane option. PETA provides free euthanasia services for people who have very sick, critically injured, or geriatric companions but can’t afford to take them to a veterinarian. One family—lacking money for vet care and transportation—turned to us for help for their cat, who had barely crawled back home after being mauled by a pack of dogs. We were able to give the cat a peaceful end to her intense pain. On another occasion, PETA was the only agency to come to the birds’ aid. If our trained technicians had not been ready to end these starlings’ misery
 
PETA also began offering our services to pounds in North Carolina in 2000 after we were contacted by a police officer who was distressed by conditions at a county pound. When PETA steps in to properly euthanize animals—at no cost to participating animal shelters—our involvement prevents animals from being shot to death with a .22 caliber firearm, illness, or worse. We know from bitter experience that for homeless animals—even those in some animal shelters—there is such a thing as a fate worse than death.
 
Some well-intentioned people might argue that the solution to the overflow of unwanted animals is to open sanctuaries. But the sad reality is that the math just doesn’t add up. There is not enough money available to us or to anyone to build enough sanctuaries or organize enough animal-adoption programs to keep up with the number of unwanted animals—particularly those animals deemed “undesirable” because of their infirmities, of course, but keeping them in cages or pens for a lifetime is no more humane for homeless dogs and cats than it is for animals in laboratories or circuses. To learn more about “no-kill” shelters, please see http://www.PETA.org/features/turned-away-a-closer-look-at-no-kill.aspx, http://www.PETA.org/about/why-peta/no-kill-shelters.aspx and http://features.PETA.org/AllCreaturesGreatAndSmall/ .
 
Putting all our resources into kenneling unwanted animals would also do nothing to stop the flow of more and more homeless dogs and cats. Preventing the source of the problem—the birth of unwanted animals—is where money and efforts need to go. PETA runs three mobile spay-and-neuter clinics in Virginia and North Carolina at least six days a week. The clinics conduct much of their work in disadvantaged neighborhoods, and deworming. We sterilize thousands of dogs and cats each year, including feral animals. Since starting our first mobile clinic in 2001, we have sterilized more than 90,000 animals, including more than 9,200 in the 2012 fiscal year alone.
 
We hope you understand that it is heart-wrenching for those of us at PETA and at animal shelters across the country who care deeply for animals to have to hold these animals in our arms and take their lives because there is nowhere for them to go. Those who truly seek to make a difference for animals understand that it is necessary to do the right thing—even when it’s unpleasant—rather than supporting false “solutions” simply because they make us feel less uncomfortable. PETA has always spoken openly about euthanasia on our website and in our publications
 
We hope that this message has shed some light on our work. To read more about PETA’s lifesaving work
 
Thanks again for writing and for sharing your compassion for animals.
 
Sincerely

P.S. A lot of the misleading and outright false rumors that are spread concerning our efforts are the work of the deceitfully named Center for Consumer Freedom (CCF), KFC, cattle ranchers, and other animal exploiters who kill millions of animals every year—not out of compassion but out of greed.

I mainly created it because the type of videos i find most interesting are the videos of a human having an intense (usually unintentional) situation with a dangerous wild animal. A good example of that would be [1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixyA49jX_XI) [2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V1J2Jyk3Uw) [3](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_-9t5lXXSU) [4](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqVE9qfg7yI). Number 4 is my favorite and the best example of what i mean.

First off: tonight was a horrible night for me.  Truly horrible.  I won't go into details; no one really wants to read a sob story.  

That being said and established

You all are the most wonderful, while that may seem hyperbolic, I stand by it.  We're members of a community that has done nothing but contribute to the betterment of the lives of others.  

I get that I might sound overzealous.  There are those of us who are pessimists.  There are those who say and do hurtful things.  We all know that.

But if one were to look at the grand scheme of what we have here

Again, I noticed that I felt a bit better.  

And then I decided to write this.

I get that it won't make it to the front page.  I get that probably only a few of you will see it

To use western science and technology to counter imperialist encroachment (late Qing modernizing slogan). but i think it must not happen in present society but it looks like the society is fucked up).

Parents in south korea hired very scary gangs to solve school bullying problem.
they look very scary with big tattoos. they act like uncle for the victim student. they spread rumor that his uncle is gang member. there are many enterprises on this nowadays. if those teenages are not students
there were 40 cases for 2~3 years. they didn't fail even a time.

I am looking for men and women over the age of 18 to complete an anonymous online questionnaire. The questionnaire will take approximately 30 minutes to complete and may be carried out in your own time and in your own environment. 

I imagine the results from my study will be interesting to most of you and as a thank you I will post a document detailing my results (when I have them) to Reddit.

I hope you enjoy the study and maybe learn a little about yourself through completing it!
