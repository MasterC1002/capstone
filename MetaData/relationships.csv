This is all a very complicated and sad situation. About four years ago my wife and partner of 8 years passed away due to complications after the birth (very rare) of our second son. I was deployed at the time, so I asked a sister of one of my Marine buddies,Cass, to help out. She had been friends with my wife, but not great friends, and she agreed in exchange for a place to stay.

At the time, she asked to borrow money to see a doctor due to shaking hands (no insurance). I happily obliged, she was an angel: doing all of the cooking and cleaning and keeping my young family together.

It turned out that she had developed some sort of neurological disorder, I never thought I'd be able to move on from my wife, and she was afraid of intimacy. I agreed that I would marry her, but keep our platonic relationship. She promised not to burden me with her debt, and we had  a prenuptial agreement and all. I know that this is 'fraud' of the government, hence the throwaway, but we were both so damaged and needed somebody

The past three years have been about as good as expected, had food ready every night when I get home, and has been working overnights as a baker and almost has her debt paid off. Her condition has improved greatly, also, due to the great medical care she was able to receive. With the boys, she is a saint. She tells them about their mother, shows them pictures, and even taught them how to read (of course the six year old just finished kindergarten, she is going to go into a nursing program.

Our relationship: still platonic, and yelled at her about something pretty inconsequential (she had taken my sons to see Santa without me). She, of course, became quite frightened, but we worked it out and I even offered to pay for her to see a counselor (she didn't). That was two years ago, and we have had little fights ever since, but have been able to work through them. She seems to understand me whenever I'm hurt, or angry

The problem, her smile, her laugh. The way she smiles with her eyes when she sees me, how much my boys love her. Not to mention that she's gorgeous, hardworking, and one of the strongest people i've ever encountered. A few nights ago I almost kissed her after we had put the boys to bed, and her hugs goodbye have started lasting a little bit longer. The other day she was taking a nap in my bed (she was washing her sheets), just lay with her and hold and kiss her

I don't know what to do, no candle can replace it.' meaning that since his true love has died, nobody could replace him. that's how I used to feel, but... there have been days where my thoughts have been occupied with Cass, and I haven't even thought about my wife. I feel bad about it, and I still miss her, but I never thought that I'd be able to 'move on.' I feel guilty and disloyal. 

At the same time, not just as friends. I don't know how to bring it up. I don't want to scare her or make her uncomfortable. but this is becoming more difficult than I could have ever imagined. I was thinking about asking her to get dinner, just the two of us, and bringing it up. But whatif she refuses? How can I gauge her interest?

If it means anything, but she pranced around, finishing dinner and putting the flowers in a vase. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

TL;DR: After my wife died

**EDIT:** Fuck it. It's been an hour on here and you've convinced me to tell her. I've called her favorite fancy restaurant and made a reservation.

Second Post: http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1fb0bg/update_i_told_my_wife_i_loved_her/

Last night was hectic as shit at first. Our younger son had eaten, even though he was fine. Her brother (we'll call him Joe), told her that he'd take care of it, and basically forced her out of the house to 'celebrate getting out of debt.' She really didn't seem like she wanted to go. At all. I became fucking nervous.

So we got to the restaurant pretty early, because she hasn't drank much since she broke up with her ex, but I figured it was a time to celebrate. We made small talk for a while, but it seemed forced, and I knew that I had to tell her soon.

So

i hurridly told her that I was so sorry, frowned, and said that it was okay, she just wanted me to be happy and that I deserved it. I told her that I didn't want to stress her out or make her uncomfortable, but I just needed to tell her, and see how she felt, and that it was completely up to her. She gave me a look and said that it actually was up to me, and promised to stay out of the way until then.

It was then that I realized something was a bit off

She said that he told her I wanted to take her out to dinner to tell her that I had started developing feelings for a girl

Our entrees came (I had shrimp and pesto gnocchi, yes I had started developing feelings for a girl, I just didn't want it to mess up what we had. She said that it wouldn't mess anything up, she still loved the boys and would take care of them and the house. I continued to then explain that I wasn't going to ask the girl on a date, though, and she asked, incredulously

Right? Thanks Joe

She gave me this look that she gives my sons when they tell her things like 'I'm going to the mall by myself' or 'I have a girlfriend named Tammy.' Then she looked away, and that I had fallen in love with her.

She then took a drink of wine, Alex.' And I'll never forget what happened next. Maybe it was a faux pas, but I leaned across the table and kissed her... spilling her wine. But neither of us cared and we kissed for about a minute, before she told me to get off her before her crab legs got cold (this was joking, but not. you'd have to know her).

After leaving the restaurant we got ice cream and sat around and kissed some more, screaming at him that he ruined everything and that she was going to have to move in with mom now. We let him believe it for about 5 seconds before bursting into laughter.

He shook my hand and told me that the boys were sleeping and left. I picked Cass up and kissed her and carried her to my room where we... welll....

Made out for like two hours and snuggled the shit out of each other. (She isn't ready for anything else

At one point the youngest son came in because of a nightmare, let him in. I woke up early to make everyone breakfast (and of course, deliver), and am about to go and kiss my wife goodbye, and ask my boss for the second part of the day off so that I can spend more time with her while the boys are at school, preschool. 

(I'm really sorry I haven't replied to everything... I was a little busy

I wanted to give you guys another update

Anyway, but they told me they would support me and help me any way that they could. I’m glad I did this now because my step-father was able to recommend an attorney to me, which I wound up contacting immediately.


I was able to meet with him (the attorney) that same day and informed him of the situation, given that I did not get into a physical confrontation with her or do anything stupid. He also told me that I might had better take a witness along just in case she claimed I tried to rape her or assault her.


After I finished up at my attorney’s office, but I wasn’t sure how she would respond after I had been ignoring her.) I asked her if I could come by and talk, and she told me that she would really like that. I then called up a friend of mine and asked if he would come with me, so I picked him up and we drove over to her place. I asked him to give me a few minutes to talk to her about the ultrasound, and then I would come back to get him. (I thought that maybe she wouldn’t let me look at the ultrasound or would tell me to leave if I seemed confrontational.) 


Anyway, and it didn’t have her name on it or any of her information. It was just a plain ultrasound photo, and I remembered some of you told me that it should have her name and information on it. I talked some about the photo and asked her if the procedure was uncomfortable and if they rubbed something on her stomach. She confirmed that they did, which I also remembered was incorrect. After this, I confronted her and told her that she had been clearly lying to me because of these inconsistencies.


She said that I didn’t know what I was talking about and that she “forgave me” and knew I would “love being married and being a father” once I stopped worrying.  I told her I needed to get something from the car and that I would be back.


I returned with the pregnancy tests and my friend and told her that, and then we could go from there. She, at first, refused to do this and told me that I was being ""cruel"" to her and the baby. I told her that I just wanted to make sure that she was pregnant, since there were so many things that didn’t make sense. I then told her that unless she did this we were over and that I would never see her again. She finally agreed to take one, and I insisted that she do it in front of me--like many of you suggested. We had another mini-fight about this, and she accused me of not trusting her. Long story short


I can’t say I was, so I got another one of the tests and told her to try again. This caused another mini-fight, and she only agreed after I repeated my threat to leave her. This test also came out negative, and she again tried to claim that it was also an error. I told her that she had been lying all along and that she never was pregnant.


I told her that we were finished and that I never wanted her to contact me again

 I told her that I had loved her and tried to make her happy and that she could have had me (and children with me) if she would have waited

A quick re-hash: I [16M] broke up with my (Strongly Christian) girlfriend [17F] because I was questioning my sexuality and didn't want to hurt her. She turned it around on me and told all of the people at my school that I raped her. We have never had sex or come close to it.

Thank you for all your responses

I brought this to the attention of the school interventionist (non-academic counselor) and my ex-girlfriend, but the interventionist with us explained to her the consequences of outing and blackmail. Once talking with the officer, she completely changed her story from all previous accounts to that, basically, she was not raped.

We made a plan with the officer and drafted a formal e-mail she would send to all of her friends and others she falsely told

I know this update is only a day later but I wanted to update you guys on what has happened so far. Even though I didn't respond to any of the comments

This morning I quietly packed a backpack with essentials - makeup, underwear, a few shirts and pants, laptop, wallet, and all the cash I could find in our bedroom, while he made breakfast.

We sat down to eat breakfast and I said, and that I expected so much more of him. Then I told him that I was leaving, and got up to get my bag from our room. He started crying and was begging me not to go. I asked him why I shouldn't. He said that he would never talk to her again, that it was a huge mistake, and he just got carried away, that he was going to break it off soon anyways, that he loved me

It was honestly so hard to walk away from him. I absolutely love him and I always will. It's such a shame because I know we would have been together forever. I wish he could have had more self-control

When I got to my parent's house I asked to stay with them because I'd left my husband. My mom said of course and I told her everything and turned into a blubbering mess. She told me I was perfectly right and I could stay as long as I wanted. I love my mom.

Tomorrow I'm going to call the non-emergency number of the police department and tell them anonymously because I live in Oregon and the age of consent is 18. I'm very scared to do it but my mom said she would sit with me while I did it so I hope it'll go okay.

I'm probably going to get an apartment and divorce him in the near future

I'm going to wait until the holidays are over to tell all my close friends

My husband has been calling and texting non-stop

I'm still considering what to do about the girl and her parents. I'm assuming that the police will find out who she is and tell her parents

Sorry it took so long to write this. I needed a minute to recollect myself and thoughts so I could at least write something coherent. If I seem a bit dazed and this post is messy

My SO got home early from work and I immediately confronted him. I showed him the pictures, he met a woman at his old office, they remained friends after he left his job and kept in touch. It wasn't until about two months ago that their relationship crossed the line between friends to cheating, when she drunkenly sent him nude pictures and he responded back. They were talking back and forth and sending pictures, eventually making plans to meet up when I was away for the month. I've never met her before, briefly heard about her in passing, but she knew from the beginning about me. She knew we were in a relationship and had seen pictures of us on his desk. She's also married. They met up once and fucked, and she's now pregnant. I am unsure if my SO is the father or not

After he explained everything, that he's a dumbass, yaddda yadda yadda. He promised he'd change. Promised counseling, promised it was a one time thing and he couldn't stop feeling guilty about it. Honestly I don't remember much of it because I was in such shock. 

I asked him to leave our apartment, my valuables, the animals, and headed to my sisters house. I have a doctors appointment on Monday for a full STD panel. There were a lot of tears and a lot of begging but honestly after what I read and now know, there is no way I could forgive him. 

Honestly, but honestly I just feel worse. One second I feel like I can't stop crying and next I'm numb and angry. 

Thank you all for all your support and advice. I really appreciate you all reaching out and all your kind words. My world kinda of sucks right now and while you're all strangers it feels good to know such decent people exist in this world.

[Half Update](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/17n4hz/semiupdatei_was_a_hair_away_from_cheating_on_my/)

Things are really weird right now but the future is clear. 

He came home nearly 12 hours later. He said he needed to tell me something. I stopped him and told him about almost booking the trip. He looked confused and asked me why it was even relevant since I didn't do it. I mumbled something about how the internet told me to do it... So there, he did not really find that part important. 

Anyway, or anything at first. Mostly I was shocked. He wasn't going to tell me until he saw how wrecked I was from just flirting with another guy. He said I didn't deserve it, he's a scum bag, blah blah. That he'd understand if I wanted to leave him. 

I didn't think it was a question of ""if"". I am here, so he put me at risk for what-the-fuck-ever she could have. She is single and definitely has had plenty of dudes around in the past year and before. He attempted to cheat on me, continued to do so, effectively humiliating me in front of our friends (since she is well into our circle), with no plans to tell me until I did something to fuck up. The tables have turned, my friends. 

As of now, we are unmarried (THANK FUCKING GOD), and he is staying in a nice hotel on my dime because I couldn't just kick him out on his ass. There is still plenty (most) of his stuff here but I am boxing it up and moving it into storage. It's funny how my confession of lust for another really changed my life, beyond what I could possibly imagine. 

You can see why it took me a bit to update. I had to call my family &amp; friends. I had to sort my own shit out. I had to go through all the feels. But

I have learned so many new lessons in these past few days

I wanted to make an update because there were so many replies and thank you guys for letting me know its ok to go to my parents with this.

My dad wasnt home when I got up this morning but my sister was already out of the house so it was just me and mom. I asked her if we could talk about my sister and I told her everything I heard on the phone. She started crying and said she was afraid something was happening because my sister had been acting so ""weird"" lately but she didnt think it would be something like that.

She called my dad and asked him to come home. I told him everything I had heard and then they called my sister. She was with her boyfriend

Her and her boyfriend got here and as soon as they came in the house it was obv. theyd been fighting again. I thought my dad was gonna sock him as soon as he came through the door but he didnt. My parents asked them to come in to the living room and talk and told me to go upstairs. I didnt

They talked to them for a little bit and told them THEY were the ones listening in on the convo (my sister knows thats bulshit but she kept her mouth shut) and told them they wouldnt be allowed to see each other anymore.

The boyfriend started defending himself and saying it wasn't any of their business what he talked to their daughter about because shes an adult. This pissed my dad off

That made my dad even angrier and said he didnt see the differerence in hitting her or saying he would hit her

They finally told the guy to leave and threatened him again with cops. and my dad said if he ever laid a hand on my sister he'd go through the cops and kill him himself.

I could see him leave from in the kitchen and he looked scared shitless. I went back upstairs to type this up. I hope everything will be okay now

Thanks for the help you guys.. talking to my parents was the right thing to do and i shouldve have went to them immediately.

Thank you all again so much for your kindness and support on my original post the other day. Because some of you wanted to be updated

On Sunday a.m., saying that he had gotten drunk and was sick, had been puking, and had become a dickead (I assume to other girl, also). He also said he didn't remember what happened, and that he was sure he and other girl didn't do anything because he had been so much of a tool to her. (It couldn't have been too bad, though

I texted him back several hours later and told him I knew what he had done

At that point, though, because I wasn't standing in his way any longer. 

We exchanged a few other less than nice messages but I haven't spoken to him in any capacity since about 10 p.m. last night. He also defriended me on Facebook. 

I gathered my girlfriends today and we moved all his stuff out of the house and into a storage unit. I also changed all the locks on my house. I left him a note with the storage unit info and a few other details about his mail and motorcycle. 

Oh! And some particularly good news: I got hired at a second job today so I won't be up a financial shit creek without him. Money was a big reason I stayed with him so long.

We have been together for 8 years

My wife (31f) is accusing me (32m) of getting an erection because of our baby (2 month

I was bouncing him on my lap while she was getting dressed.  I was watching her in various stages of being unclothed and I got an erection because of this.  My wife saw my erection and flipped the fuck out.  She grabbed my son and threw a book at me while screaming that I am a baby molester.  She says I am sexually attracted to my son and she was going to call the police and have me arrested for molestation.  

What the fuck?  I am not attracted to my son, I just never really noticed.

So this happened last night

So

I left. I moved in with my uncle, and he apologized a lot. After a couple weeks, I decided to give it another try. We went to couple's counseling, talked every day, and things really seemed to be getting better.

I started to think maybe things weren't getting better as I thought. I found out he still had her phone number saved on his phone. He kept his phone on silent and with him at all times, and she had been to the apartment while we were separated. He also admitted to cheating on me with a different girl last August, and his weak defense was that he was on ecstasy. He started throwing tantrums every time I acted suspicious, sad, or just wanted to talk. He refused to change his phone number, and sometimes the girl would call him upwards of thirty times a day. She said she was in love with him and would kill herself if they couldn't be together.

He finally changed his phone number. She went insane, and slipping notes under the front door. Then she suddenly stopped. I was relieved at first, but then he started going on long drives every day (like 6 hours), going to the movies by himself, never answering his phone when I wasn't there. 

Finally, and yeah, I snooped. I had to reason to trust him. He had pictures of them playing with our dog from Sunday, when I was out of town visiting my aunt. I remembered that he had an SD card he always kept in his wallet. On it, I found more pictures from the last month of her in sexy lingerie, selfies of them kissing, and like 20 shots of her ass in a thong. 

Clearly, but I left. I've moved in with my mom and am looking for a better job. I gave him every chance, and he really fucking blew it. That girl is an idiot. She once asked him who the president of England is, and she's fucked like three other guys since they've been together. I've been tested, and I'm clean, thank God. I know he can't be really happy with her, but he chose her, I'm happier now that I left than I was the whole time I was trying to make it work.

That said, there is nothing wrong with really trying to fix it. If I hadn't, I would have always wondered if I made the right choice. Now I know I gave it my very best, and it didn't work, and it isn't my fault. Now I know I'll never go back to him, I won't keep holding on to the memory of our happiness, and I'm truly free. I hope this story can help someone.

tl;dr Yeah, he kept fucking her, I left. I'm glad I tried to work it out, despite the fact that it didn't in the end. ",Updates,False,,False,t3_1gqr1g

A week ago I posted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/167gcz/i_21m_am_falling_for_best_friend_19f_and_im_not/) wondering what to do about my feelings. Unfortunately I can't remember what I made the password for the first throwaway

I spent a couple days thinking about it

We were hanging out on Saturday at her place, just the two of us. We'll meet up and go get dinner, see a movie, go get some ice cream and then I'll drop her off at her place. This probably happens once or twice a week, although it isn't always the same thing. I told her that to me, it seems like we're casually dating except without any kind of physical contact. I went on about how I really enjoy spending time with her, and just doing whatever with her. It doesn't matter what

Eventually she got a little impatient and said, although I was completely ecstatic. 

Fast forward to Monday and I show up to her house sweating bullets. She's wearing the dress I got her for her birthday last year and looks absolutely beautiful. I tell her as much and she gives me a kiss on the cheek and we hold hands as we walk to my car. I took her out to dinner at one of our favorite restaurants

By now it was late and freezing cold, and I ended up spending the night there. We're a couple now and I can't remember being this happy. :) 

Thank you to everyone who told me to go for it! I can never express how much I appreciate all of your comments!

Hello everyone. I apologize for not updating sooner

So John came home last night around 11:30 as I was watching t.v. in our bedroom. He came in and looked like absolute shit

He apologized to me for the way he had been acting recently, more expensive room in our hotel (which Mike and Tara had to end up staying in that night so as to make sure I wasn't aware of the fact that John was supposed to propose; they switched key cards while I was walking back).

He then told me what I was afraid of: ""it just didn't feel right, he said he knew that it was not what he wanted, and thought it would be better to not ask me to marry him because he knew it wasn't what he'd want in the long run. 

So at this point I'm in hysterics, put my head in his lap while he sat on the couch, and just kept incoherently saying ""please"" in between sobs. Not my proudest moment. But, at that moment, this man was my best friend, the future father of my children. I just never, ever in a million years, and that's all he could say to me

At that point I could barely breath, she just looked so helpless while I sat there in the car crying so hard I eventually got a nose bleed.

So, I'm on Facebook, looking through a bunch of old picture of John and me, sobbing uncontrollably and sending him text after text with reasons why we should be together, and I eventually stumble onto Mike's page through a tagged photo. He updated his status from a few hours ago to something along the lines of ""California was amazing, wish work would send me for more than five days."" My stomach started doing flips...because John kept telling me he was spending the days he was practically ignoring me with Mike. But Mike was in California for several days...and we're in Canada, so not very close.

I freaked. I called Mike from my house phone and when he answered

Basically, not even Tara, but he felt guilty and was glad I called him. He apologized and said if I had to tell John that he told me, I could. 

That's all I know for now. I haven't bothered contacting John yet, which is practically all that consumes my thoughts, I feel disgusted, humiliated and devastated. It actually feels like my heart is breaking in two and I have no control. 

I need to get my stuff from our place

tl;dr: boyfriend told me he didn't see a future with me

**Edit Update: John called me a bunch of times while I was in an rx-induced/depression coma. I woke up as he was calling me again and kind of just answered the phone without thinking about it. He was crying and apologizing (I guess Mike told him that I knew), but that he'd be home tomorrow, so could I please meet him to talk about things at our house? I said sure. I asked my mom to drive me to our place a little while ago and I kidnapped my dog, brought her back and I'm feeling much, much better. I'm also NOT meeting with him tomorrow.**

1355591281.0,14welq,[24M] Relationship of 7 years with [24F]. Just found out she's cheated on me a few days ago. I've got terminal cancer. Can't deal with this as well. Help.,,1153,292,472,"A little background first I guess. I was diagnosed with cancer at the start of this year and I've been through a fair amount of shit throughout the year. I had intensive chemotherapy from January through to April

Throughout all of this, and  she would always tell me she loved me even when I looked skeletal, lost all my hair, and was being sick. I wondered at how well she was coping with everything... I put myself in her shoes, thought about how I would deal with it and I found myself questioning if I could. I mean, I have changed SO much, I'm not the same person she fell in love with. I know that. I mean

I've been back home with her the last week or so after my last treatment and I've noticed a few things. She's become a bit more distant, after seven years you can easily tell when something's up, and minute changes in facial expressions and behaviour stick out like a sore thumb. So, the other night, she tells me she's going out to see an ex co-worker, a guy, just the two of them. My first thoughts were, ""Oh

She comes home drunk. Not like...mega drunk but the kind of drunk where you roll your eyes and get ready for silliness, her answers are short but I put that down to being hungover. This carries on all day. She barely talks to me, I can't cheer her up no matter what I say. She doesn't sleep that night and her mood carries on to the day after. Now I KNOW something is up and, to be honest, I've already assumed the worst. I think she's had thoughts about me, about how she doesn't actually love me anymore, about how she doesn't find me attractive anymore, I may be right...but that's not what's been on her mind these last couple of days apparently. 

She changed the password on her phone, I'm getting angrier as I type this. So she met this guy, they got drunk together, with no one else around, and they makeout in the bar. He ""can't stop thinking about"" her, and ""neither can I,"" according to her. So she tells me she's going shopping today and I saw that she's meeting up with him right now and this shopping is just a ruse. I just....I don't know. Seven fucking years of PURE happiness. We have this one blip at the start of the year and I thought we were going to come out of it ten times stronger. But she needed comfort from another man...even though I am right here, and I'd be so happy to help. I just don't  know how to cope now. I go from anger at this FUCKING DILDO WANKER of a guy for doing it to the most soul crushing depression I've ever felt. Seriously

She's told me that she knows I would never cheat on her and she has told me that she would NEVER cheat on me, so many amazing memories... She asked me today what I would have done with my life if she wasn't in the equation. Does she want to make it any more fucking obvious? ....here's the thing, though: I can't confront her. I love her so much and I'm terrified of losing her. She is my absolute world and I can't even imagine my life without her in it. I want to take her all around the world, see everything this planet has to offer and I want to share all these experiences with her. I want us to come out of this cancer battle stronger than ever before and I want every day to be full of happiness. But it turns out I'm just a naiive, spineless, hopeless romantic who's too much of a coward to deal with this. I can't turn to my family because they'll turn on her. My friends have all become a bit more distant with me as well so I don't feel close enough to them to talk this kind of thing through anymore. Besides, if any of them Reddit, I hope her co-worker is a Redditor because then he can fucking see how hard this has hit me and I hope he drowns in an ocean of guilt.....

Someone give me some guidance. Please. I don't know who to turn to anymore......please.

TL;DR: GF of 7 years cheated on me. I'm a hopeless wreck. Trying to deal with terminal cancer on top of this. Too much of a coward to confront her as I'm scared of the outcome.

**[UPDATE]**

Hi guys. 

Sorry it's taken me so long (apparently) to give you guys an update. Been trying to sort out all this mess and only just found the time to sit down and get on here.

Anyway. First and foremost

Now to the update. I think I may have gone against the status quo a bit but we sat down and talked about this. For hours. I explained how I knew, I had a few paths I could go down to make the conversation a bit easier and it certainly helped. She managed to open up about everything, about how she's not known how to have dealt with everything, and how alone she's felt whilst going through it, and how what she's done has made her physically sick. She knows it was wrong and she's cut off all contact with the co-worker (who, by the way, knew about my cancer- I know some people were saying he was totally innocent in all this) and she can't bear the thought of us not being together... 

Our relationship has turned around these last couple of days. Some of the fun spirit we lost has come back and we've gone out and enjoyed some great nights together. I know people may find this weird that I can somehow forgive her in my situation (and a week ago I would have been right there with you) but you didn't see the look in her eyes when she was explaining everything to me, but I'm happy with where things are going now. 

Some of you are going to tell me I've done the wrong thing

Since my previous two posts were so popular I decided I'd update you all on the ridiculous circus of my life.

After the conversation from my last post

Anyway

Anyway

My brother-in-law told my mother-in-law. Jerk. That went over about as well as you'd think it would. She called my husband and freaked out about us just asking for our daughter to be molested. She also said that it would be better if my sister and her boyfriend were married. If he's pedophile I'm not sure what difference being married makes but that's a crazy person for you. My husband hung up on her.

This is when shit gets really crazy. SHE CALLED 911. Seriously. I'm not sure exactly what she told them but something along the lines of our daughter being alone with a sexual predator. The police showed up at our house expecting to find our daughter with a pervert.

We explained our situation and the officers (super nice!) recommended we make an official report about harassment. We're also going to go for a restraining order. I was mortified that the police had been called but they assured me that they'd seen crazier.

So that's our life. We're attempting to completely cut her out. I feel somewhat guilty if she's having some kind of mental breakdown that we're not doing more to help, I'm done.

And to think

TL;DR: My MIL called 911 on us and we're attempting to get a restraining order.

*EDIT: Just when you thought she couldn't get crazier! She left my husband an angry voicemail saying she can prove that my sister's boyfriend is a pedophile. He didn't believe it (of course) but called her to find out what she was saying so we could tell the police. 

She said that my sister's boyfriend had been attracted to my sister when she was a child. Which is true. He and my sister started dating when she was 12. He was also 12. Apparently

Ughhh. Hopefully we'll have a restraining order next week and she'll take it seriously.*",,t5_2qjvn,1351187404.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/120tbg/update_2_my_mil_pierced_my_8mo_daughters_ears/

--------
Here was the original [story](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1b3h13/i_44m_caught_my_daughter_15_having_sex_in_our/)

YESTERDAY: I felt a little more calm and collected in comparison to the day after I found out what was happening. My daughter's breakfast session with me was very brief as I just made my coffee and ran out. I wasn't trying to avoid her. I had two board meetings to attend that day

I come home later in the afternoon. Daughter is home. She welcomes me with a hug and kiss and then proceeds to be very cute and bashful with me. She asked how my day was and what business plans I was planning to make. Things that she hasn't had interest in talking about for ages. This alone was a red flag that indicated that she probably thought that I knew about her and the bf

The night ended with my daughter asking if she could join me on the couch to watch a movie until she fell asleep. She put her head on a pillow on my lap and watched the movie. I will admit that I had some mixed feelings seeing her head on my lap because it just reminded me of when she was 7 years old and she would always watch tv with me like that. Those memories surprisingly began to lessen my disappointment. It was at that point that I became really calmed down about the situation and realized how much my love for her will always overcome anything that may disappoint me.
After she fell asleep

TODAY: I pick up wife from airport in the morning. We decided that it wouldn't be smart to approach her both at the same time. Her mother would break the news to her and immediately take her to get contraceptives and have an introductory talk about sex. Then I would talk to her when she got home. And then finally

According to my wife

They came home and my daughter immediately tried to hide from me upstairs. She told her mother that she needed about an hour before I had the talk with her. I gave her that time and space before going to her to have our discussion. She was embarrassed to look me in the eyes but I told her I needed her to cooperate so that we could both get through this. I told her that her mother would continue talking to her later about the more personal sex questions later and told her that she did not have to include any of that in our conversation as I didn't want her too either. I got the following answers from the questions I asked:

. She and Chris have been having sex for about 4 months.

. Chris was a virgin as well when they started having sex.

. It was both of their ideas to begin having sex

. There was mutual consent and neither one has pressured the other into doing something they didn't want to.

. There was only one time when Chris unintentionally did something she didn't want but she informed him right away and he apologized and stopped--this made me realize that I needed to sit down with little Romeo and have a little chat with him.

. That night was the first night they had sex in our home. All other times were at his house.

. Both of Chris's parents know they have sex in their home. They also found out the hard way. Both thought they were too young but in the end

. His dad is more accepting of the kids having sex than his mother. His mom is still uneasy having them behind closed doors at home but the dad is more ok with it at this point like any stereotypical dad with his son.

. His dad had a talk with Chris about how to handle my daughter respectfully and that I was happy to hear at least.

I ended our talk with telling her that yes

She apologized over and over again and told me she was stupid for not being more careful and courteous of the possibility of anyone else being home. I told her not to dwell on it anymore and to move on. I emphasized that I wanted her to be safe at all times and that if she was old enough to have sex, and lives as well. And because having sex is a privilege and not a right, she would be responsible for purchasing the BC pills and condoms coming out from her savings account we have set up for her.

I told her I loved her and that I would always be there for her and that she should not be afraid to come to me with any questions or concerns. I told her I planned on having a little civil talk with Chris about the topic sometime this weekend and she said ok.

The train was horrible. There were all sorts of delays, I put my arm around her, she rested her head on me, etc. We got to the train station and it was already dark. We drove back to my house, where she had left her bike in my backyard. 

We were complaining about the train, or if we should take a chance. I told her I'm in love with her. She told me she's in love with me too. We kissed. We embraced. We made love. We cuddled.

--

Anyway, I had a conversation with my girlfriend last night about some of her recent behavior (wanting me to finish inside her, offering to buy condoms for me, talking excessively about babies and the like, etc.) and also about the concerns (she was trying to get pregnant) that I was having about these things and our relationship, and it did not go very well—to say the least. 

--

I started off by telling her that I felt like we had been having problems communicating lately and maybe this had led us to have a misunderstanding about where we felt we were going. I then told her that I felt like maybe in our conversations about our future together I had made her think that my unwillingness to settle down was a sign I was still looking around or didn’t want to commit to her, but that I just didn’t feel ready for those things yet. I didn’t want to be hostile, so I first tried to reassure her of my commitment to her before I confronted her about trying to possibly get pregnant in secret. This is the point where our conversation started to go badly.

--

I then questioned her about why she had been so concerned lately with babies. Was it because several people we know have just recently gotten pregnant or had babies? Or was there something else that had caused this development? She became defensive at first saying that “all girls think about babies a lot, so would it be so terrible if we have a baby now since we plan to someday?” I told her that the timing wasn’t right and that I was becoming increasingly concerned that maybe she wasn’t trying as hard not to get pregnant and brought up some of the reasons why (see previous post). I said that I had talked about this with some other people (you guys) and that they, too, thought it seemed like she might almost be trying to get pregnant. 

--

Here, but I was so angry/hurt/shocked that I don’t remember). I asked her if she knew for sure, and she said that she has been to her OB/GYN to confirm it and didn’t tell me because she wanted to see how I would react to the idea.

--

I think at this point we both were in tears. I accused her of manipulating me and deceiving me,” as she was not going to get an abortion.

--

I left after that and haven’t talked to her since. I don’t know if there is anything I can do at this point, I can’t imagine that I could ever be with her again given that she broke my trust. I suppose the moral of the story is to always wear condoms and never take for granted that a girl is using her birth control—no matter how much you trust her.

**EDIT:** I can't thank you guys enough for all the advice, I intend to contact an attorney today (June 12) just in case she is pregnant, and I then plan to call her and insist she take a home pregnancy test (but I will also contact her doctor's office to also confirm whether or not she is pregnant) and make sure she understands that we have no future together.

He told her that he always assumed I was still aggressive and angry from my college football days and that really scared him. But he thought he would be an idiot not to own up to his actions and come to me to explain his side. He said that he put himself in my shoes and realized that he would probably react the way I did initially and knows it wouldn't be right to leave the situation as is if he intended on not showing any disrespect towards my wife and me.

I appreciated hearing all that and the kid began to actually grow on me at that point

I told him right away that he needed to relax because I wasn't angry and aggressive. I told him that being strict didn't mean I was heartless. We sat down and before anything, they will be the final decision makers in their relationship. All I expected was mutual respect, consent, and compromise. 

He understood everything that I said and then began apologizing about what happened that night. He said he meant no disrespect to me or my wife and that they even discussed closing the door but ""stupidly"" decided it wouldn't matter according to him. I told him to relax and that I have put myself in his shoes too the last couple of days and realized how easy it would be for a couple of teenagers to act on a whim and not be careful about the things they do. I told him that common courtesy always matters regardless of you being alone or not. What you do invariably affects others at some point down the line. 

He mentioned that his parents knew but had only recently found out (a couple of weeks?). He said they were shocked themselves and didn't know if they should approach my wife and I in fear of us lashing out at our daughter. So instead, unlike my daughter, has to pay for his own stuff with an allowance that is half of my daughter's in which he has mostly worked for one way or another. His parents provide funds for all important and normal costs that Chris may have but have him pay for all the things he uses for ""fun times"" from his allowance therefore condoms fall under that category. 

I told him that he shouldn't worry that much about the money because being that my daughter is in a similar boat

TL;DR - The boy came to talk to me. He apologized and we discussed some ground rules for my house. He's a good kid.",,t5_2qjvn,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1bgwbc/final_update_i_44m_caught_my_daughter_15_having/

The first thing I noticed was around April of this year. Back when it first started, but there'd be no sound. He got his vision and hearing checked, and ""nothing was wrong"".

He started doing or saying things that simply did not make sense (in addition to the above). We got a cat tree for our pet. The night after we bought it, but whenever I asked him what it was, he'd dodge the question.

Gradually the frequency of things like this kept growing. For example I caught him trying to pour cereal from empty box and getting frustrated that none would come out

I was in denial for a while. I finally confronted him about it when I came home and he was trying to pour water for the cat. He was holding the bowl sideways

I cried. And then he came over to me, and I told him he was just holding the bowl sideways. He looked at me, and walked over to the sink and tried filling the bowl sideways. Then he rotated it, and when it started to fill up he just dropped the bowl and started crying. He asked me what was wrong with him.

We talked about it all and things were going to be ok again. He said to call him out on it whenever he did something that didn't make any sense. We made an appointment for him to see a psychiatrist as well. He was diagnosed as bipolar. I don't know how psychology works but I didn't think he was having mood swings

He wasn't. He started staring. For long periods of time he would just stare at something. It would be hard to snap him of it

Today I came home to see him standing in the kitchen staring at the bowl he had previously tried to fill sideways sitting on the counter top. My 3 year old was crying

This has been a dramatic few days. My MIL has gone entirely crazy. 

My husband has been the only one talking to her over the last few days. He wanted her to understand that HE was upset too and it wasn't just me being crazy. She accused me of brainwashing him with ""pseudo hippie bullshit.""

She's furious that I took out the earrings. She said since my daughter will get her ears pierced again later that I'm needlessly torturing her just to be petty. She has called several family members to get them on her side. Luckily

My 20 year old sister is our usual babysitter. If she babysits

My MIL threatened to call children's services and report us for letting some ""random guy"" sleep in the same house as our daughter if we don't allow her to spend time with Annie alone anymore. My husband told her not to expect to ever see her granddaughter again. That was last night.

I'm just floored. I can't believe it's all turning out like this. My husband keeps apologizing like it's his fault. We've already decided that if she calls we're going to file some kind of harassment claim against her. 

I had no idea people could be this crazy.

[Last Update. Baby steps.](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1drxyg/update_step_in_the_right_direction_after/)

I figured now would be a good time to update you guys on the situation with my girlfriend. Prior to now, I can definitely say it was 100% worth it.

Let's see if I can break this down because quite a bit has happened


- Girlfriend ended up going to the support group almost immediately. She'd chatted on their forum pretty much the entire week before she went, she went to her group and I drank coffee. Sometimes we'd talk about it, sometimes we wouldn't. 

- Eventually, day or night, no matter what's going on. She was told to call them ANY time she has a night terror, anytime she feels an anxiety attack coming on, anything. This woman is basically her on-call personal therapist, only without a degree. This woman is WONDERFUL, and has been so amazing for my girlfriend. 

- Not long after my post, aside from me using a condom. We didn't want her on anything hormonal, and she's holding off on an IUD (she's looking at Paragard.) So far, no problems, but it hasn't been that long and her anxiety has gotten much better, but still too soon to tell if it was the shot or if therapy is what's helping her.

- Girlfriends counselor found her a therapist, all in all, she goes to her therapist, next day group, therapist, group. It's a good schedule for her, she says, her therapist is male and she's completely okay with that. I think it's great for her because she's sort of overcoming that whole

- She hasn't been put on any medication, she had them every other or night or so until she just stopped having them. Her therapist says it's probably because she has an outlet for everything she's thinking/feeling instead of bottling it up and it letting itself out while she's sleeping.

So, obviously but for 2 months, I think she's done a damn good job.

I just want to say thank you to everyone who replied. I'm sorry I couldn't get back to everyone

I thought about what everyone said and I decided I would try talking to his mom first. I was a little taken aback by her reaction

..what?! Ultimately, lazy, and he is spoiled beyond belief. I won't be held back anymore, in any aspect. I can't go to school and be in a relationship with someone who is not and wants to stay out until 6 in the morning. I won't be with someone who accuses me of wrong doing when I don't do anything! I also will not be an enabler anymore. He can figure out for himself how much I really did and how much I really loved him.

I have talked to my best friend, I plan on moving back to my hometown, 2500 miles away from here, where my mom is. Once I'm done with work and am finally off for a couple of days, I'm packing my shit up and not looking back. I don't care what garbage excuses he has to say to me, he no longer has any control of me. I'm giving back everything he has given me and will be asking for some things back.

So

I spent the night over at her place

I told her ""You know

BOOM! The words ""**It's not only that...**"" came out. She unleashed a verbal tirade about minor things that she claimed was neglectful of her.  Apparently I dont care because I didn't ask her what she wanted at the grocery store.  I felt sort of bad until half-way through the tirade until I remembered something... Jokingly (while slightly frustrated) that she kept saying IDK to whatever food I asked her about

I finally stuck up to her. I unleashed into her about how she just fabricates things in her head. I asked her a million times what food she liked

""I don't know, and not being able to have sex!?""

I picked up my back pack

Her jaw dropped. ""you can't do that"".... ""yes, you're acting insane. this is insane. and your demands are insane."" (in the calmest voice I can), and I walk out of there peacefully, and gently close the door.

So - walking away from her apartment she's screaming and yelling crap at me. Keep walking. By the time i'm out the elevator and out front she's on the balcony screaming horrible crap at me in front of EVERYONE. I'm apparently dickless. then I had a dick

I turned around

I hard some laughter, hun!?""

Okay

While we have a ton in common and I love her so much

It hit me then that we make much better friends

I realize now that I deserve much better. I'm always looking out on how to help others and so focused on what others want that I never really looked at what ""I"" want. And looking back I wasn't treated the way one should be

I went in the bedroom and saw she was awake. I laid down and asked her about her day. I asked her if she wants to talk about what is going on and she replied with ""No"" while looking away from me. I ask again and she quickly replies again with ""No."" We laid there for about 5 minutes quietly and then she starts bawling. I start tearing up a bit.

She asked how long I knew something wasn't right and I told her a month ago I could tell something was up with her. Which she replies with ""You know me so damn well"" and I said ""I know."" I explained what I realized and she agreed with everything I had to say. We both laughed a bit while passing the tissue back and forth.

We talked about what we want in life and she realizes now that she needs to focus on herself. What she wants to achieve and where she wants to be. I helped her realize that she is trying to fill the void of being unhappy with herself with a relationship, rather than trying to use a partner to fill it.

So we are giving our two months notice to the apartment complex and moving out. We are going to try to remain friends but we will see how that works out.

I feel sad that it couldn't work out but excited for what the future holds for me. I'm going to focus a lot more on me now and hopefully be able to share my accomplishments with someone I truly love and who truly loves me.

I am content. :)

Thank you so much from the bottom of my heart reddit. You guys and gals are awesome.

Edit: Just wanted to note that we both decided that neither of us are going to get into a relationship anytime soon and we are both going to start focusing on our lives to better ourselves first.

**TL;DR** I realized that I wasn't happy in this relationship as I wasn't treated with the respect or given the affection I deserved. I helped her realize that she needs to focus on herself and her life instead of seeking a relationship to fill her needs in life. Lots of crying ensued. Going to try to be friends but we'll see. I'm looking forward to what the future holds for me. Thank you reddit

-----------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------

**Update:** Hey thanks for all the replies! I wasn't expecting so many... And I'm actually quite surprised as I was half expecting most people hoping for a more... drama-style breakup

To address a few questions, even if this man wasn't in the picture, I feel I still deserve better and am not so much concerned about that situation anymore.

Will we actually stay friends? I really don't know, but at this point I realized I don't want to be in this relationship anymore. I was a doormat for staying in this relationship and always blamed myself for the way I was treated. Deciding with myself that I was not going to try to stay in this relationship, even if that was what she wanted, was probably the first thing I did for ""me"" in a long time. I felt empowered and found a love for myself that I have been ignoring for too long.

She apologized to me about everything. I told her how upset I was about the whole situation. Her acknowledgement and taking responsibility for what she put me through recently is what helped me agree to stay friends with her.

Some of you said that she wasted 9 years of my life. I don't look at it that way at all. While the relationship itself didn't work out

It will be interesting to see how things go until we move into our own places. I'm sure there will be emotions to come but I just need to remember that this is not a relationship I want to be in.

I feel like learning how to rock climb

1373047902.0,1hpblr,I (21F) turned my little brother (17M) in to the DFCS for child neglect and he's going to hate me.,might-as-well,897,181,263,"This is a long story so I will mostly use bullets to summarize but there is some required background info first:

My 17-year-old brother, Alice, for around 8 months.  She is basically his first girlfriend and he lost his virginity to her.  Alice has a 3-year-old son, Brady, and a 5-month-old daughter, Bailey, each from a different father (neither of which is my brother).  Alice was married to Bailey's father but divorced him around 3 months ago.  Within a few weeks after the divorce was finalized

From the beginning, disrespectful, trashy, immature person I have ever met.  She grew up with a terrible home life, so I have tried to be supportive in hopes that she would grow up a little bit, but there is no hope for this girl.  She's racist and bitches about everything and is convinced the entire world is out to get her.  I could go on and on, but I'll leave it at that and if I need to elaborate on anything I will.

Meanwhile, they had nowhere to go, so out of concern for the children my parents grudgingly let them move in.  Alice as never had a job before, and Mike worked for a few weeks but after losing that job claims he hasn't been able to find another one.  They literally just sit around day in and day out, living off my mother's very limited income.  Mike claims the children as his own, going so far as to have Brady call him “daddy” even though Brady's real father is still in the picture and is called “daddy” as well.

* They feel no need to work to provide basic necessities for the kids, formula, food, clothing, etc.  My mom (who is enabling them and that's an entirely different story) provides these items because she doesn't want Mike and the kids to go without, despite her being backed up on bills and beyond broke herself.

* They get $600+ dollars in food stamp assistance each month
* The baby, so she's always been on the small side.  However, I've seen them go 12+ hours without feeding her (despite doctors' orders to feed her every 3 hours).  She's now over 5 months old and weighs 10 pounds, which is below the 5th percentile.  She looks emaciated.

* I've witnessed them get up in the morning

* From the time Bailey was a few weeks old when the excitement of having a new baby wore off

* They have, so it was easily 90+ degrees in the house) to cry herself to sleep, without even checking on her periodically.

* After my dad basically kicked them out after months of them living there, nasty, has a serious wolf-rat infestation, garbage piled up around the house and property, etc.  They haven't attempted to clean it up or make it safe. Brady's room doesn't have an actual floor, just plywood with no covering.

* Mike takes it upon himself (with Alice's encouragement) to punish the little boy.  For everything, Mike “spanks” him.  I'm not inherently opposed to physical punishment, but I feel like it should be reserved for extreme situations (like maybe running into the road or something).  However, it's so bad that if Brady does anything wrong and sees Mike coming toward him, he immediately starts screaming and crying out of fear.  I've been around before when it happens, and could hear Mike “spank” him at least 10 times from two rooms over.  It made me sick.

I guess I should cut that short and summarize where we are now.  After all of this, and Alice said she's raised one child and she doesn't need Mike's mama to tell her how to raise her other one; just to show how disrespectful and completely self-righteous she is).  They think they're the world's best parents.

So... I called the Department of Family and Children Services and filed a complaint against them.  I've been genuinely afraid something will happen to one of the kids, the case worker gave out enough details in the initial investigation that they can just about pin-point that it was me, and I know Mike is going to hate me for it.

I guess my question is, is there any way we can make them wake up and realize they're neglecting and in some cases abusing these kids?  I don't think they mean to hurt them, I think they're just so immature and so convinced they aren't doing anything wrong that they genuinely don't see a problem.  I have little hope that the investigation will do any good, and I'm worried about the kids.

Meanwhile, ""Lets just say whenever I find out who it was whether it be male or female. Lets just say you should pray to God I don't run across your ass! Have a great day haters:))""  They're so convinced it's just someone trying to cause unnecessary problems for them that they won't even consider the complaints against them.

TL;DR:  My little brother and sister-in-law are horrible parents.  They let their kids (3 years, diapers, etc. and are emotionally abusive and negligent.  I finally broke down and turned them in for neglect.  How can I salvage my relationship with my brother, and how can I make them realize they need to change for the sake of the kids?",Misc,False,,False,t3_1hpblr

First off, thats got to have one best positivity and sweetness to meaness and jerks ratios on all of reddit, like ever. You guys knocked it out of the park for me, I'm still figure out why.


So yesterday after getting a barrage of support from you guys on my phone every couple minutes non-stop all day

I had to stop him to let me get a word in and tell him it wasn't his friends so much as it was what HE said. When I told him what he said his whole tone changed

but I just started to cry, telling me he was just angry and didn't speak very well. That he really does find me attractive even if the world doesn't, and his friends don't.

I calmed down pretty quick; I'd basically cried myself out the day before. He took me to his computer and showed me an email he sent to all of his friends on Sunday. I wish I could copy paste it now, for time indefinite they'd have to find another host, were no longer welcome in my home (he actually said ""[my name]'s home"", I thought that would make it sound like I was ordering him around being a bitch, but he said he just wanted to empathize how wrong what they were doing was). Seeing him stand up for me again made me happy, especially seeing me do it without talking bad about me, helping me believe it really was just heat of the moment bad word choice.
 
He told me to wait in the room and left

But I realized that it had to be several thousand dollars he'd spent. We budget pretty thoroughly, change from groceries, etc.

When I say that sometimes I'm not sure I deserve him, so I have to go, but I'll be on again tonight.

So about 2 years ago, but then we got back together as an official ""couple"" in the last month of the relationship, only for me to find out through mutual friends that she was still having a sexual relationship with another guy.  After I broke up with her, this other guy called me and told me that him and my GF were in love with one another, and that I needed to ""get lost"" or he'd make me ""sorry"".  I asked him to clarify what that meant, but he hung up the phone.  These two have been dating ever since, and are now engaged.

So, someone in her family, very accidentally, informed a mutual friend of ours that she (my ex) had gotten pregnant and that the baby was mine, and that she had given birth to it, and her and her fiance are raising it as though it's his baby.  (My son is now about 10 months old).

So, her fiance called me cursing and screaming, telling me that I needed to leave his family the hell alone.  I remained totally calm, and eventually got him to explain that she had indeed given birth to a baby, and that they had, because she had been sleeping with both of us at the time, tested him for paternity and found out the baby was not his.  So, assuming she's not lying about who she was sleeping with

I contacted a lawyer, and both of them and their attorney, where I was informed that they were going to be fighting for full custody with only 2 hours per week of supervised visitation, which my lawyer said was outrageous and would never fly in court, to which their response was to get up and walk out of the room without any further word.  A court date was set for later this month.

Then, basically telling me that I'm ruining everyone's life, that I'm being selfish, I'm tearing her family apart, etc.  I explained that I have no intention of ruining anyone's life, but that since this baby is mine, that I do have every intention of being as much a part of my son's life as humanly possible, including domestic violence, my lawyer is telling me that there is a very good chance I will actually win full custody of our son.  This resulted in even further hysterical crying

That's when things get crazy heated.  Minutes later, so I answer.  Now it's her fiance.  He tells me he wants to meet with me to ""talk this over rationally"".  Given his prior threats against me, and given his history, I told him no way would I be meeting up with him.  He eventually talked me into meeting him for a face to face conversation in a police station parking lot, which I finally (reluctantly) agreed to, even though my lawyer told me it was a bad idea.

To make a long story short, in exchange for me dropping the case and permanently signing away all rights to custody or visitation, ever.

I showed the check to my attorney, and he explained that yes it is legal, though I would have to pay income taxes on the money as the deal was presently constituted.

I'm actually considering taking them up on the deal.  Now, my ex, is crazy.  She's basically the typical spoiled rich girl... she's always had everything handed to her in life and she works for nothing and expects all the best of everything in life without ever having to do anything for it.  She is spoiled and entitled, and you would not believe how horrible her attitude can be at times.  Also, this guy she is engaged to is a seriously scary person... I mean it was like something out of a movie, this big burly dude meeting me in a parking lot and grimly offering to bribe me away.  His eyes have this ""dead"" quality to them that chills me to the bone.

On the one hand, but the next 16 years of my life will become a living hell of dealing with these people.  I have even considered the idea that given this guy's history, and given their apparent access to so much cash, maybe at some point in time they'll decide it's cheaper just to pay someone to kill me or something?  So in many ways, it seems like the easiest thing would be to just take the money and walk away.  I could use the cash to pay off my student loans, and there would still be enough left over to retire my mortgage.

On the other hand, or being his male role model, makes me feel like a total piece of shit for even considering taking money.

At this point I'm totally torn.  I've turned to every friend and relative I've got

Ok first let me apologise for the throwaway

I'll get right to it. Last night was my bucks night and my fiancee's hens night. We've been together for 4 years

Our wedding day is this Thursday

So last night we got home at different times, and immediately said that she must have dropped it somewhere. This struck me as odd, because originally we had to have the ring resized to fit her (when I first proposed), so I know it fits perfectly now. Not exactly easy to slip off. 

So I asked a few more questions, and that she needed to get some sleep. 

Later that morning she was in the shower, one I've never seen before, and inside is her ring. What??! So I'm about to call out to her in the shower but then I get suspicious. Something feels wrong. Usually I'm not one to snoop, I believe in privacy and trust as the foundation of a good relationship, but I had the most overwhelming feeling. So I looked at her phone which was sitting on the nightstand. She had two missed calls from a number I didn't recognise, and a message from the same number in her inbox. The message just had a street address and the words ""see you soon xx"". At this point my mind was racing and I had butterflies in my stomach. Shit. Shit shit shit. This took me completely by surprise, and I'm not used to feeling paranoid. She's never given me any reason to doubt her in the past.

She got out of the shower and I was still too numb to say anything. I felt like I needed some time to process what I'd found. I mean

But then came that afternoon. I came back into the bedroom after making some lunch (this was around 1 pm) to find her beaming at me. ""The bar found my ring!"" she said

So that's where I'm at, or both. What the hell do I do? Obviously the immediate answer is to talk to her about it, but what do I say? Help! I'm absolutely lost and I feel like my world has been turned upside down by this.

We're engaged!

It went great! She got out of her grad school classes early, but she still had no idea!  I took my camera and in my camera bag I hid a bottle of champagne and two plastic champagne flutes. I popped the question after dancing around the bandstand and giving her my sweet proposal speech, I got down on one knee (she started crying) and **she said yes!**  She even yelled ""OH MY GOD ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!"".. who knew that really happened in real life? We popped the champagne and carved our initials and the date into the inside of the bandstand.  We had about an hour before our dinner reservations so she could change and do her hair and then we went back to where we had our first date, and we even both wore the same clothes we wore on that date, too!

*****************************************************
First off - thank you to everyone who replied with legitimate advice. I came here looking for outsiders perspective and people who would not sugar coat things. A lot of you did just that. I might not have agreed with all of it, or criticism.

Secondly - To those of you who messaged me saying that I need to kill myself... I'm sorry to disappoint. 

I'm sure I'm forgetting a lot here


Also
**********************************************
So, and this was something that was really bugging me, so I stepped outside of the office real quick and called him. I said sure, definitely come over. But I also said that I had been thinking about some things lately and I wanted to talk to him about them. The back of my mind was definitely screaming ""Don't say, 'we need to talk'!! Don't do it!"" So I did my best to not terrify him, as suggested by so many of you. Either way, he said that sounds find, see you tonight. 

Once he's at my house, and I reminded myself the entire time. I can get pretty emotional when it comes to him, but me crying and trying to be rational was not going to help. Sugar coating would not help either. I also knew I had to tell him that I knew.

&gt;Me: ""B
B: --15 seconds of wide-eyed terror--  ""... ok...""   
Me: ""I need to talk to you about all of this.""   

Then begins my long speech to him. I told him that I wasn't sure what his plan was with the ring

""B, and I told you that there are a few things that I would need from you before marriage could even be discussed? Things like you being independent on your own, away from you parents? You knowing where your money is coming from, saving, understanding what it's like to be responsible for only yourself? Well, it's now a year and a half later, and  I don't see much that has changed.""

B then tries to say that a lot has changed. When I ask him what has

""B, I want to know that the other person is working just as hard for not only our future, but their future as well. A year and a half later, and you still live with your parents, and have not really moved toward your future at all. You don't have money and I don't understand why you don't. You're an amazing person with a lot of potential in your future, but you don't have the drive to go after it, and I don't know why.""

* ""I have bad credit and can't get an apartment"" - No, and many, many places look at income more than they do with credit. My past two places have not required credit checks, but rather employment verification. I'm not saying everyone is like this, but I am saying that there are options. 

* ""Every time I start saving, etc. etc."" - While that's fine and dandy, having a saving account is part of being prepared for these expenses. Buying that $500 thing, when you could have set aside the $500 and then bought said thing later, is what it's like to be an adult. Sure, I have money right now to go buy a brand new wardrobe, but if I did, I'd be screwed. It's about preparing for life and the unknown.

* ""I have been working on my passions"" - (Note: He has them, you've been talking about the passions, but not actively pursuing them. I've offered to go with you to technical schools, training, entry level jobs, whatever you need to get this ball rolling into a professional career, but you haven't stepped up. I'll do your resume, but you have to want to set up the appointments

So, I would shoot it down with legitimate choices and concerns. I asked that when he leaves, to spend time thinking about what I've said. That if he has more questions or thoughts to please discuss them with me, but he really needs to think about it on his own. If he thinks I'm wrong in all of this, he needs to say that too (and if he does, I'll have to deal with it then).

So, but also the point of realization.

&gt;""B
""It would! It's not going to be easy
""How would it just 'work' B? Better yet
""I was thinking about proposing at Christmas
""Alright B, he does like you, but because he would point out everything that I have, and even worse. You want to ask a navy seal for his blessing, when you live at home and have no money? Think about how bad that would go.""    

I think a light went on in his head. He went from being crushed and heartbroken to going ""Oh shit"". There was something in his face that changed. He went from being defensive to looking like he was thinking really hard. We then sat in silence for a very long time. A few questions, I thought about it, and was just honest. I told him that was his decision. I was not breaking up with him, but a lot has to change and we have a lot to work on separately and alone. I can't tell him if keeping the ring is better for him or not. ""Do you want to see it?"" - No, I can't see what good that would do. 

He sat there for a long time, and he said ""It has to be hard to say the things you've said. You've brought up a lot of stuff, and I don't know what to think yet. But thank you for giving me the time to think about it. It's definitely been a dose of reality."" After that, he left. I gave him a hug for a long time, told him I loved him, and that we'll talk later. 

So - we'll see. It's not something anyone can immediately change, she's crazy.. I'm fine"". And I need to not back down on these things either. 

**TL:DR: Talked to boyfriend about everything. Didn't understand, then thanked me. Proposal sufficiently postponed.**

First I just want to say thank you for all the helpful responses that I received yesterday. I've never in my life had to deal with a situation like this. I also hope it is the last time as well. 


As soon as he got home from work this morning I told him that we needed to have a serious conversation. We both sat down and I told him that I found the cup he had been pissing in behind the chair. That it was the most disgusting thing I had ever seen and I was repulsed that he would actually do something like that when we have a perfectly working bathroom upstairs. He started to actually DEFEND himself as to why he was using it! I tried to stay calm but I couldn't anymore and eventually it turned into a heated argument. He stated that the cup was easier to use than going upstairs to use our bathroom which is seriously 30 ft away!! And he usually dumps it in the KITCHEN SINK when he's finished.. W.T.F. That right there was a deal breaker for me. This has been going on for quite some time. Upon further inspection where I originally found the cup I could clearly see urine stains on the floor. How I didn't know about this sooner I don't know. But I'm really glad that I do now. I can't continue to live with this sick fuck any longer. I'll be moving my things out today and will be staying with a friend for the time being.

**(First off

Previous Post: http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/12qiif/my_m23_parents_m58f63_have_taken_me_out_of_the/

Hello all, that they prefer my sister.

I wanted to get this sorted out as soon as possible for book the afternoon off work and went round to see them and learned two new things about myself from my parents: 

1). **I was an accident.** Apparently after my sister my mum had a miscarriage and they decided not to try again and then a year later along pops me. Because I was unplanned they hadn’t really though through their finances and so for about a year and a half my Dad had to work two jobs and has always felt that I made him miss out on my sister growing up and that because he rarely saw me he has never really connected with me. As for my mum

2). **They are disappointed with me.** They don’t like my fiancée, who has treated them appallingly, who stole money from them regularly until she moved out and who I was persuaded to lend £2,000 of my savings for University to so she could clear some debts; she never paid that back and I had to get into a lot of debt myself to get through my final year. Its not even like I am horrible to my sister now, I love my niece and nephew and spoil them all the time and for their sake will help her out from time to time with money for bills/food.

Apparently this is why I am not in the will (and never have been – except when I was younger where custody of me would have been given to an aunt until I was 18). They have “never really seen me as their son”
I’m not down to get anything as they don’t really view me as part of the family. Me going away for three years to Uni made it worse but its something that they have always felt. They asked me if I felt that it was wrong what I did and said if I could persuade them otherwise they would change it somewhat


**Tl;dr. I am excluded as my parents are unhappy with my life choices despite never telling me so before. Also I was unwanted and so they have never really connected with me or viewed me as part of the family. Because they were so focussed on my sister I became self succient and grew up faster and that made them feel more distant. My sister means more to them than I and they do not want to change their minds or try to work things through.**


**I have no parents now.

First off, and I really do adore her, aside from this one kind of weird behavioral trait.  We have very similar interests, share many mutual friends, and get along on a day-to-day basis quite well.  

The problem is that every few weeks, she'll accuse me of taking her for granted.  I really don't think this is the case, as I go out of my way to compliment her and say ""I love you"" almost every day.  

Anyways, play ""Amazing Grace"" (the song they played at my grandfather's funeral a few years back), lay in bed, and cover herself with a sheet.  Then I am supposed to kneel down and say some ""last words"" to her.  She gets pissed if I don't cry, sometimes withholding sex as punishment.  

I've always known that she has some self-esteem issues, but I can't keep mourning her death every few weeks.

**TL;DR**: I don't know how to summarize this. Girlfriends nightmares led to a six hour conversation about her being raped and abused by multiple people in her life. She won't talk to a therapist

Throwaway for obvious reasons. This might turn out to be more of a vent than really needing advice

We've been together for a year come end of May. We started having sex before we were dating

Before I begin, so this is just to give you an idea of how violent and loud she got during sleep.

The first few times we slept together, she started waking me up at night by screaming and thrashing around in bed. I would get her calmed down, and hold her until we fell back asleep. She insisted she didn't want to talk about it, that it was just a nightmare. She would go through, cycles, I guess of this? She'd be alright for a few nights, sometimes even for a few weeks

It was so bad that she would scratch and bruise herself from digging into her arms, gripping the sheets, just, it was awful.

About two months ago, so it was really taking a toll on my sleep and hers as well. Some nights this would happen two or three times. 

Four nights ago, but like, a life or death fight. She just wouldn't snap out of it, until finally after clawing my arms and busting my lip she snapped out of it. She was shaking, and was doing that weird cold sweat thing. It scared the shit out of me, and we didn't go to sleep afterwards. After she woke up, and seemed to understand where she was and who she was with, and I needed her to talk to me about it.

An hour later

She broke down and told me about her ex. He beat her, and three of her fingers on her left hand. He would choke her, slam her into things, and she showed me the pictures on her laptop from when he'd slammed her head into the side of his truck. The pictures were taken by a friend of hers when she was going to court against him. She pointed out all the scars on her body and told me the stories behind them. With every one, my heart broke even more.

I knew that her home life had been kind of shitty. Her mom had kind of abandoned her when she was thirteen, when she had him put in jail. 


It doesn't end there. When she was 6, pulled off the road (I know where she's talking about, because my brother and I used to go fishing there) and raped her in his truck. He shoved an A&amp;W rootbeer bottle into her bottom, and then basically made her clean him off with her mouth. She told her mom about it, who's response was to tell her not to tell anyone because if her dad found out, he would kill the little bastard and she didn't want her dad going to jail for it. 

After telling me everything, but it happens) and she would freak out if a door got slammed, even accidentally. I know now all of this is because of her ex, and it hurts...

I don't know how to help her. I *begged* her to see someone, or rape her. It just breaks my fucking heart and if I could find her ex or the guy who raped her, I would fuck their shit up. 

How do I help her? Is there anything I can do to make her feel safe, she's everything I want in a person, and in a relationship, and I just can't get my head around how you can treat another human being, especially someone like her, worse than fucking trash.

It used to hurt to see him

My parents were very upset I moved and keep thinking I will change my mind. But I won't. My dad was almost angry and said I was being an idiot and if I was going to ""ruin my life"" I wasted a year crying because what's the difference? But that's just his way. My brother said they needed the space anyways and would turn my room into the baby's.. so he's being the same self involved boy he's always been. 

I hope he starts medicating again for his bipolar disorder

First of all I want to say thankyou to all the people who replied with support and advice, but I'll do my best to update as thoroughly as I can.

I still can't wrap my head around everything that has happened in the past 48 hours. A few posters suggested that I go to the address in the text message, perhaps this way was not the most mature or calm, but I was so upset that she was lying to me and I wasn't thinking too clearly.

So I waited until she'd left the garage to ""go get the ring"" and them I followed her out with my car. By this point I was second guessing whether or not I should just wait until she got home to confront her and thinking I was acting too crazy and abruptly

I drove carefully behind

She pulled up to the address and I pulled into a driveway a few houses down, and then a wave of relief flooded me. It was a woman. Someone I had never seen before, but a woman nevertheless. Must be a new friend my fiancee made at the bar, who had invited her to a party after the hens night was over. All this relief and clarity made me feel so stupid for thinking badly of her for even a second. But then the woman got into my fiancee's car, and my fiancee leaned over her. At first I thought she was helping her close the passenger door which sometimes gets stuck, but then I realised she was kissing her. Full on, open mouth

I can't really remember the rest of the day. I remember slowly reversing out of the driveway and driving home. I felt like I was on autopilot as I got home and got into bed. I don't know how I survived those 6 hours until her shift ended (I called her work and actually made sure she was rostered on for that evening and her manager said she was). When she got home I told her immediately that we need to talk. She had no idea I know about the ring in her bag or the woman in the car. This was 20 minutes ago

She has never said anything about liking women, but not like this. Not behind my back. I feel so deeply betrayed.

**TL;DR**: Baby steps.


Hey /r/relationships

I'd held off from talking to her too much about everything she had told me because she made it pretty clear she didn't want my opinion of her to change, how to find her a therapist, and how to hopefully get this going in the right direction, I decided I needed to talk to her about seeing someone. 

Last night

I asked her if she would consider going to talk to someone *with* me. She got kind of pissed at first

She said she wasn't ready to go in and talk to someone yet, and that she wasn't sure yet. Then I asked if maybe she'd be interested in finding a support group. This didn't really click with her either until I explained that *if* she went to a group, she wouldn't have to speak, but she might be able to get to know some people who could recommend a therapist for her. This seemed to work.

After some googling

We went back to bed, introduced herself, and mentioned she was considering coming to the group. She wants to get a feel for it first, but said she hopes maybe this Thursday she'll go. Since it's a women's only group, I can't go with her, but I told her I'll drive her and sit in the parking lot while she's there.

Also, but said she'll schedule an appointment with her gyno this week to talk about it. 

So... I know it won't be fixed over night, and has a huge problem opening up to people. She was afraid even if she found a good one, she'd just sit there not knowing where to start. 

I'm hoping that as long as she knows I'm backing her 100% in this

Thanks so much you guys... I needed to get everything off my chest and I appreciate all the wonderful messages and comments you guys sent me. And for those of you who had more to say than just ""break up with her

And also, find that appropriate, especially after her story. But I didn't mean that boys aren't capable of taking care of girls, or that all of them are rapists or abusers, just that I would avoid that altogether with my children and make damn sure I knew who was babysitting my child.

Well

So within a week of the last post, and sure enough... within a couple minutes of the case worker leaving, Mike called our mom, furious.

Basically, taking pictures of the garbage piled up throughout, the plywood floor in Brady's room, the rat holes in the walls, etc.  He basically told them they had one week from that day to get it cleaned up and he'd be back to check.  Brady has been at his father's house a few states away for over a month now, so he wasn't present for this.

Mike and Alice also had a dog (one they had obtained for free from a grocery store parking lot) that was essentially starving to death because they couldn't afford to feed it.  They blamed the trash strewn throughout the yard on this dog, also from a parking lot giveaway.  Not extremely relevant, but illustrates their character and I had been hoping the CW would notice this irresponsible behavior as well.

Moving on to the next week; they conveniently scheduled Alice's doctor appointment for the day of the CW's return, and we began to question whether the investigators even actually cared.

Then we heard that they had contacted Bailey's pediatrician and she wanted to see the baby before speaking about the case.  Mike and Alice came back from that appointment with reassurances that Bailey was now 10 lbs, word for word, that he just ""needs to see the boy when he gets back in town, to make sure he's alive, and he can close the case"".

Until yesterday... Please note that my details on this are a little patchy because I get the updates second-hand from others, that she needed to see her that day and that furthermore, they may want to pack some bags because she might be admitting her in the hospital!

I have no idea what snapped in the doctor's mind to make her realize this isn't normal, and there will be weekly appointments until she's making progress.  At least now someone is paying attention, even if DFCS isn't going to do anything beyond the bare minimum investigation.  I'm hoping when the little boy returns, he will have similar nutritional guidelines placed.

So, but there has been progress, and we fully intend to file another report at the first sign of more outright neglect (like leaving one of the kids unattended for hours, etc).  We also have others who are willing to report them also, if necessary.

The only other thing... she's been posting a lot of statuses like this recently:

""Everybodys got pregnant bellies and having babies....I know I'm still young but I extremely miss having a big belly! Hmmmm... I miss miss miss it. Babies are blessings from God you just can't have enough blessings. We love our two gorgeous children a gorgeous little girl and handsome and so smart little boy! I love my family.""

So... she's going to get pregnant again any day now and there's nothing anyone can do.  So there's that.

A) They felt that I would go onto college and be successful. Whereas they think that even if Ryan gave this baby up

B) My depression made them hesitant to inflict that on anyone

C) ""How many grandchildren can we give away?""

D) They thought I would be pleased they were helping Ryan.

I explained to them that the idea of a baby living in the next room was like a hot iron. That I genuinely didn't know if I could cope. I can't even volunteer in the church nursery for an hour on sundays... and now there will be a baby at my place 24/7. I know trying to forget isn't the best strategy

And my dad said that they didn't realize I would feel this way. That he thought I was content with my decision now. That I'd be happy? He said if he had known better he wouldn't have offered for her to move in

I reminded him that he told me he ""would not have any teenage kid of his raising a kid in his house."" And it disintegrated from there into a screaming match.

He texted us the next morning saying he was at his dad's. And considering we needed to regroup

I didn't bring it up until we got to the empty house (my wife and the youngest who isn't in school yet went out) but he did apologize immediately. When we got there

He seemed embarrassed and tried to interrupt me by saying, it's not fair to Jonah and Rebecca that they have to live in all this disharmony because he can't follow reasonable rules.  I told him that he isn't a little kid and that kind of behavior could get him arrested. I also told him that it made me respect him less- because there was nothing decent about hitting someone who is smaller than you and loves you completely. 

I told him I know that he gets contradicting views from his dad about what being a man is

I outlined his ""punishment"" (one me and his mom came up with together). His xbox, and phone are not his until we see a change in his behavior. He is also grounded for a month, solid, with any excursions after that being dependent on what they are and how is is behaving. I encouraged him to spend this time with us as a family, but other than pulling out a deck of cards/board game on the weeknights and a redbox movie on the weekend, I won't force it.

I am forcing him to go spend his saturdays as a big brother for children who are victims of domestic violence. His counseling session will go on (his counselor showed appropriate dismay at the revelation and I think Connor has a dialogue with him and I worry about disrupt it). And on  thursdays

He balked at all this. Said he was really sorry and would make it up to his mom but that he wouldn't have any free time and he would lose his friends.

But then

I worry I went soft, then he insisted on cleaning up. Rather than whine about being bored like he usually would when grounded, he borrowed a book and read in the family room. I think he's trying. So we will too.

tl;dr I left and am so glad I did. Always always always trust your gut and fuck the creepers! Kindness should never be wasted on shitheads.

Thanks to all who responded. I GTFO'd on Sunday morning and am now staying at a hotel downtown. The internet didn't work there yesterday, haha. 

It's funny, won't fuck me, spends all our money on crystal meth, kicks the dog, and pees in my shampoo. What do I do??"" and then goes ""but I don't want to break up!"" when the entire Internet tells them they obviously need to be done. I realized, reading that the entire Internet's consensus was to leave, that I WAS THAT PERSON. Humbling

So the details. Three things happened on Saturday that convinced me to leave:

1) Realizing I smelled and my hair was greasy enough to cook an egg in, and having to leave my locked bedroom (the suite door was a clear sliding door that doesn't lock - not cool), and deciding I shouldn't anyway because if I ran into him it'd be safer to be repulsive. 

2) Not eating or drinking anything after breakfast because I didn't want to run into him getting food or even going out to buy bottled water (can't drink tap here) 

3) Reading all your responses. 

Sometime between choking down my malaria pill sans water and panicking when I heard the doorbell ring at the neighbor's house I realized that THIS IS FUCKING INSANE. I didn't even notice how freaked out I was until after I made a reservation at a hotel - the magnitude of the relief I felt alone was enough to know I'd made the right choice.

So Sunday morning, along with a patio) for lunch. I said I'd be up in a minute, packed up my shit, listened to make sure he was still on the roof, and left. At the time, I felt like such a coward for not speaking to him face-to-face about leaving, but after what happened next I'm glad I trusted my instincts about that

I texted him in the taxi to the hotel: thanks for everything, I was disturbed. He texts back this masterpiece, the Platonic ideal of manipulative creep - ""OK fine. I know that nothing will happen to you with me. You're not the first client to have stayed here, but whatever. I've been a victim of my own goodness, my own desire to treat my client well. My apologies.""

I also wrote the woman I'd arranged this room with on Saturday to say I would need to stay elsewhere, and to maybe even consider booking female guests so that they're not alone to completely avoid this situation. Reading between the lines, of course, I was saying ""Your landlord is a creep, and please don't let this happen to anyone else.""

I do feel bad for them. He is a very good friend of theirs, betrayed, and guilty - which they shouldn't, they were so sympathetic, talked to him about it, and didn't do anything wrong! As I finish up dealing with them, I'm trying to empathize with how it would feel to hear that a good guy friend of mine had aggressively hit on and peeping tom'ed one of my friends; it can't possibly be good. **So

Those of you who told me not to worry about my company and my coworkers were right on. Everyone at work has been unanimously supportive. I was so afraid that they'd think I was both overly sensitive and culturally insensitive, they'd do exactly the same thing. One of my project managers kept in touch all weekend and even called (international, long distance, on her cell) when she didn't hear from me yesterday because of the hotel's internet situation. I feel so, so incredibly lucky to work for such kind, caring people. 

Better yet, unfortunate though it was, this was an important test case, and the official conclusion is that shit happens, do what you have to do, just tell us about it. Once again, go my company!

So yeah, ate some ice cream, and watched the tide come in. I kept my window open all night because I'm on the 5th floor and I fucking can. I trusted my gut: I was really friendly and had great conversations with several people, women and men, who came up, introduced themselves, and didn't seem shady, especially if it's clear you're not from here). I also told each and every scammer who came up to me on my walk with some sob story or ""gift"" to go fuck themselves

I'm actually glad I had this experience relatively early in my stay. I'm glad I know my instincts won't fail me and to act on them sooner than later. I've learned that it's okay to come off as kind of bitchy - interactions between people with bad intentions and the people they prey on are truly a zero-sum game

Going forward, nor do I expect it to - the guys I work with are wonderful and respectful. But of course, I've also learned that you never can tell.

Thanks to everyone who gave advice and brought me to my senses. Y'all are the best.

So me and my girlfriend have been living together for over three years now, we listen to each other, compromise, and the sex is great. She's all around a great person. She, like me, is previously divorced (she was married for 12 years, me for 22), she doesn't have any kids. 

I have two kids, on the other hand, is a totally different story... Me and my ex wife somehow totally screwed up on her, and I don't know what to do.

First, but she soon gets fired for lateness or absenteeism, then goes back to being unemployed for 4-5 months. It's not that she can't get a job, she just doesn't apply for them AT ALL. I give her a house to stay in, food eat, I let her drive a decent car, and I maybe give her a dollar or two every week or so (hoping she'll use it for gas money to go get a job.) I recently shut off her cell phone

On top of this, literally screaming at me if I take a day off of work about how, I ""need to fucking leave"" so she can have the house to herself. Our A/C is shot right now and she's was up in her room, literally, throwing a fit and screaming how I ""need to get the fucking air conditioner fixed,"" and calling me all the names in the book. 

All kinds of stuff that me and my girlfriend buy for ourselves go missing. Toilet paper, and laundry baskets are some of the most common victims. She has two cats she's kept in her room for years (they're practically feral and attack me and my girlfriend's cat when they're let out), so cat litter and cat food go missing all the time.

I've been begging my ex wife to let our daughter move in with her

**The Story**

So my daughter has been absolutely awful lately. The bitchiness has increased tenfold

And I was completely understandable when she told me today that if my daughter doesn't move out in a month, but I don't think it's going to happen.

I just don't know how to *force* my daughter out. I don't want to call the police to get her out. And I don't know what to do about the cats

And god knows I love my girlfriend and want her here.

**TL;DR** -- 24-year-old daughter doesn't work and acts like this is her house and causes a lot of drama. GF is understandably sick of the drama and gave me an ultimatum: either I kick my daughter out or my girlfriend is moving out. I don't know who to pick. I just want to live with my girlfriend and my daughter get a job and maybe eventually move out on her own.

That's just silly. I was just saying that watching all these other people get married was frustrating. 

Okay so I sat him down, we should be able to talk to each other. So he tells me he doesn't know how he'd give me what I deserve. He doesn't believe that I don't care how or where we do it. That I should get this big elaborate wedding even though we can't really afford it. He feels like a piece of shit because of it. Also the part about his dad is true. His dad will not accept our marriage as valid.  

So I suggest a secret wedding. Just us with one guest each. We go down to city hall and then go for dinner afterward at the fanciest restaurant we can think of. My parents are dead so that's not really a problem for me. My sister can be my one guest. He looked relieved. A huge weight was lifted off his shoulders. Our five year anniversary is in October and that's when we will take the leap. Instead of a big wedding

I've also asked that he be more up front with me. He avoids the small problem by not talking about it at the time

Thank you everyone for your input, I went to the funeral. It was the hardest thing I have ever had to witness. I got there and standing in the doorway were the two saddest people I have ever seen in my life. They looked empty and just a shell with no life. I went and hugged my friends and we all just cried. Everyone in the funeral home gathered around because we were so loud in our sorrows. She kept screaming in wasn't fair and she didn't know why this happened to her. My other friend (who is the father) cried as well and just hugged both her and I. A baby that was so full of life and would grow up with my son is gone.....just, gone. She told me to hold my son tight, never let him go, cherish every moment, every burp, gurgle, lifted up her head, disbelief

Love your children

TL;DR Was worried about going to funeral at the thought of hurting my friends further since their child that died was only days older than mine. Worried about how they would react to me there even though they said they wanted me to attend. I went, vented, and I feel like our friendship is not in jeopardy anymore.

So I originally wanted to work things out and stay with the guy. I was being dumb (especially for putting up with it for so long and not dumping him sooner)

This morning I woke up to him being pissed off about a relationship status change on facebook (that happened about two months ago). It was the straw that broke the camel's back. I spent all day yesterday stewing over the perfect way to just let go and get him out. He did it for me this morning.

He came upstairs raising hell about us not being 'engaged' on facebook. Mundane shit. Really just a completely immature overreaction to something that didn't even matter. So I let him let it all out about how pissed he was that no one thinks we're engaged

I rolled my eyes at him.

He got even more upset.

I told him to leave and he did. So I used the time that he was gone to pack his shit up and put it all outside in the driveway. He got home and started slamming things around so I stood up

They got here and he had the nerve to say that he was going to take our son. I objected and told them that he has no place to go, no clothes, no shoes, no jacket, no bed, no bottles, toys, food

I immediately called the landlord and had him removed from the lease. I called a few of the resources that you wonderful redditors have provided

First of all

Well, I know). There were tears shed, apologies made, and for a while I thought everything was going to be a-okay.

...until last Friday when I discovered that she had not deleted her account on this certain social networking site and still maintains contact with just about everyone she had an emotional and sexual connection with.

Being the doormat that I was, she changed her tune and wanted me to wait *until fucking Christmas* so she can greet this one guy a happy birthday and send the rest of them Christmas greetings.

That did it. I snapped. I mean, and took her to her parents' house. While there, we argued some more - she insisted that she hadn't done anything wrong, and that she really just wanted to be friends with these guys and that I should trust her more. Right, I've heard all that before. I kept insisting that she cut off contact with them, but she just wouldn't budge. After a few hours I decide it was all pointless and made my way home.

It's been two days now, not that it matters anymore.

1375988126.0,1jz1zj,Me [30/M] and my small/younger-looking girlfriend [30/F] just moved to a new city and everywhere I go I feel like people are thinking that either a.) I'm a creepy pedo or b.) have an inappropriate relationship with my daughter.,tonnesand,645,120,326,"My girlfriend and I have been together for four years and have lived together for two. We lived in a rather small town. We'd known each other most of our lives before we became close and eventually started dating. Most of the people back home knew us so none of this was a problem.

Recently we moved after she received a great job offer in a much larger city. We bought a condo together

The problem is that my girlfriend is 4'10"" tall

I'm 6'2"" tall, wrinkles, a newfound need of glasses, etc). She on the other hand does look quite young. I can't argue that. Hell my neice, who just turned 14, looks older.

The following things have happened lately that have really been putting a lot of stress on our relationship. So much so that all discussion of marriage has ceased and there seems to be a huge level of tension between us:

1. She has been pulled over *twice* with me in the car by cops who thought she was too young to be driving. Each time the cops have treated me like a pervert and a criminal, all that crap. 

2. On 4th of July our condominium held a fireworks event in lieu of allowing its residents of having their own celebrations. The GF and I thought it would be a great way to meet our new neighbors so we attended. I overheard at least three separate people making comments like ""that's disgusting"" or ""we should call the police"" just for holding her hand/lightly kissing her.

3. Our complex's manager came by shortly after that event to ask us the nature of our relationship. Nevermind the fact that both of our names are on the lease

4. Some internet hero, and posted a bunch of them around the complex. The cops actually paid us a visit because of that. One of them even told me they'd received dozens of calls about it.

5. According to my GF

6. At my new job my manager told me to remove the picture I had on my desk of me and my girlfriend. Because we were holding hands in it and some co-workers of mine had said it was ""inappropriate"". When I told my manager it was just a picture of me and my girlfriend he honestly asked me how old she was and when I told him he obviously didn't believe me. He then said to take it down anyway even though I'm far from the only person in the office with such pictures on their desks. Since then he has been treating me like shit as are most of my co-workers.

The ironic thing is that GF is technically older than me. But she really does look like a kid I guess and her only problem with that is that I have a problem with that. She finds most of these incidents funny and doesn't seem to understand how much it bothers me. No matter how I try and explain it to her she just says the old ""You shouldn't care about what other people think"" line or some variation. 

We're drifting apart because of this. She sees it as a problem in my own head and is frustrated that I can't just get past it. Meanwhile I resent her for not understanding how upsetting all this shit is to me. It's gotten to the point where I don't even want to go out in public with her and when we do I certainly don't want to do so much as hold her hand.

I don't know what to do except possibly move back home. I know she doesn't want to do that especially over something like this but I'm sick and tired of being seen as a freak or a pervert for being with her. I am in complete love with her but I honestly don't think I can take much more of this shit.

1338315439.0,uaobd,Update: Do you tell the spouse that her husband has been cheating on her with your wife? ,Unicornmayo,614,95,149,"My [original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/havdd/do_you_tell_the_spouse_that_her_husband_has_been/) was one year ago followed by [an update](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/i2gx5/updatedo_you_tell_the_spouse_that_her_husband_has/) eleven months ago.  I am a 26M

To summarize: Approximately a year and a half ago, was having an affair with her personal trainer who was also recently married and just had a child.  I came to /r/relationships with a question about whether to tell the wife or not.  After getting some good advice on pros/cons, I went ahead and told his wife.  They were understandably upset, husband claimed I had not guts.  His wife decides to stick it out with him.  

Following this

So, but ultimately I am glad it is all done.  There was some confusion when the lawyer put the wrong names on the paperwork that went to the judge and that took a bit of revision.  It feels like a huge weight has been lifted from my shoulders- freedom.  

My ex-wife gave birth to a healthy baby girl in December or so I'm told- may she be rendered many sleepless nights.  

I have not heard from or seen the personal trainer.  Still a douchebag

I am dating a new girl now, but overall, I'm positive.  Dating at first was very awkward trying to get around the stigma of me being married but separated.  

I bought a condo, probably far more active than I have have been in my life.   I feel great, and I look great (in my own mind at the very least).   

My next step is to get into a good business school for my MBA

**BACKSTORY**
----

So

In a good spot in the middle of our talking trek across the sand,"" as I'll continue calling him, seemed nervous. I started.

""I know that you'll be able to keep a secret. It's really important.""

""Yes

Okay

""Tell me! Please!""

Despite how much I wanted to tell him previously

I turned it into a joke


A few days later

I didn't

And another bright day almost a week later, thinking I was a weird fag, and hang out with me less and less. I didn't want to lose Brad as a friend. I turned it into the same joke. 


**TODAY**

----

Today

It was forecast with a wind that told us it would storm soon. We took our bikes out on a back way to get near our usual spot. We had a good conversation while on our forty-five minute ride and trek. Then I told him to sit down with me by the water. He agreed only when I told him it was a real serious conversation

""The thing I've been avoiding telling you is...""

I rethought the entire plan

I blurted it out. ""...I'm gay.""

It took him a long time to actually grasp that I was serious. It must have been five minutes until he finally spoke again. He asked me questions

Surprisingly, I won't become feminine, and things will stay the same. He just knows something important about me.

I didn't want to scare him too much, instead of girls. I told him that the magic that I saw in Disney movies between a boy and a girl never really existed between me and a girl. I only saw it between a boy and another boy. I only told him barely enough to make him positive that I was homosexual, and that I wasn't joking around. 

He was so accepting and so nice. We paced back and forth about fifty times on a small stretch of sand trying to fully understand each other. He told me that he thought since he was ""girl crazy"" (his words, gay or anything, but wasn't clear that I was definitely gay. I reassured him that I was. He said that no matter what, he would be there for me. He really said that. He thanked me for trusting him, and said he would never tell anybody. (""Who would I tell, anyway?"") I said that I just wanted one person on Earth to know that I'm gay and be cool with it, and he said that he'd be that one person. We awkwardly bro-hugged. 

And then after that? Everything was back to normal. We joked around, but we somehow came out of it to be even closer best friends.

**tl;dr: After waaay too much hesitation, not me, and was super supportive. After that? Everything's better than normal.**

Hey guys

I read every comment and I gained a better perspective from your experiences.

Unfortunately (or fortunately) we decided to go our separate ways. The decision was mutual. While were content together at the time

There is a reddit user who said it was important to salvage the future and don't worry about the past. I agree with that statement. We had simply grown too far apart.

It is amazing how much religion affects relationships. My ex and I were happy together. It's funny how what you believe in *after* you die can make such a huge effect in a relationship in *current* life. I mean

I am now in support of the separation of church and relationships. Hehe

She had asked about earrings in the past and I had told her that I wasn't going to put my baby in pain for something cosmetic. Also I think babies look weird with earrings.

I want to thank everyone that gave me kind words and supported me in telling my boyfriend and in urging me to go see a doctor. I was extremely upset yesterday and just knowing that some people cared enough to try and help me out made me feel a lot better about the situation I was in. As for those people who called me a liar and an awful person

I had lunch with my bf and told him all of the details that I recalled from the evening

He took the afternoon off of work so that he could go with me to the doctor because he knew I would probably be too upset/embarrassed to share all the details with my doc if I was there by myself. I was tested for STDs and nothing came back positive today but I guess some of the other cultures can take a bit longer to come back; I'm hoping they will all be good news as well. 

My Dr. suggested that I get both a blood and urine test to see if there were any substances still in my body. At the time the only prescription drug I am on is birth control pills and I haven't taken any over the counter drugs at all in at least a month. Turns out, sedation and has strong amnesiac properties. Guess that explains why I have no recollection of my evening. 

I did some more research when I got home and it turns out that temazepam is a pretty commonly used drug for date rape. I am still unaware of whether or not this friend had sex with me because I don't have any memory of it and my doctor said any evidence of it had been washed away since I showered after the event.

 I am now feeling extremely violated, I figured it was a lost cause since it had been too long ago, but apparently the amount in my system was high enough that it remained there for a longer period of time. Without the encouragement of this forum I may have just informed my bf and then never gotten tested for anything so I cannot express enough gratitude for all the thoughtful posts. I am relieved to know that I was not the one to bring myself to such a point of inebriation that I could not even remember hours of my evening. 

I am kind of a wreck right now and have a lot of emotions to sort out but I am fortunate that my bf is being extremely supportive and is trying to help me work through them. He also suggested that I should maybe see a therapist if there are still things about that evening that I would rather talk to someone else about

Sorry this turned out to be such a long post, idk what I would be doing right now if I had not decided ti post this here. And to those of you who claimed I was lying, please do not be so quick to judge next time, especially when you really know very little about the character of the people involved.

First and foremost I'd like to thank everyone who read and responded to my post! I got back many helpful comments that I would've been lost without. Because of my situation

So

After apologizing we set a time to talk on Saturday. We met up in a coffee shop and after sitting in quiet for nearly five minutes we started to talk (I'd never been so nervous in my life). I started by asking him why he'd waited so long to tell me and he answered by explaining that he was scared to lose what we have because he really likes me but he didn't think it'd be a huge issue and there had never been the right time. He went on to say that though his family took his revelation well when he first started the process in 2011

The first half of the conversation consisted mostly of me asking a lot of questions about him. Like when did he know he was meant to be a man (which didn't sit well with him

Eventually we got to our relationship. I told him that I'd have rather been informed before four months but I got that it was something that lay heavy on his mind and was hard to say. I explained that I felt like I was lied to and

Ultimately

In this last week alone I've learned so much about transsexualism, I believe that this will help me in becoming a more accepting and understanding human being. The best I can do is try.

Until next time friends

And be good to each other.

Shortly after my post

* I wanted our relationship to be completely stable and long term
* We could feel obligated to keep it going even if we didn't want to later because we might feel trapped with the other.
* I did not, especially sexually.

She found it all reasonable and it went well (actually had similar doubts of her own). We've made the resolution and we're 21 days sex free! I don't know why I used an exclamation point.

My brother and sister in law negotiated some things with her parents. They made a petition for guardianship, a few months I think). Gist of it is, my brother and sister or law can care for her (doctors, signing papers, etc) without the parents, and the parents can only reclaim those rights by petitioning the court again. Odds are by that time she'll have turned 16 (recently turned 15) so in the unlikely event that it occurs, she can just choose who she wants to live with then.

Someone else suggested she have a room of her own so she can have a safe area, with plywood, plastic wrap, rugs, and decorations/lights of various genres. We had been collecting material we bought off craigslist (where I most of the current furnishings came from) to build her own space for a while. It is nearly done and she really likes it!

So last night he came home from work and I was waiting for him. Truth be told I had been dreading this because I thought that he was probably going to end it and was maybe a tiny bit weepy and so he walked in to me ugly crying. I managed to choke out my apology and explanation and begged him for forgiveness for not being honest and keeping information like that from him. There was a lot of tears and snot and a lot of begging to not end the relationship. Then, hushed me up, and told me he loved me, that he was in this for the long run and that now more than ever he was going to be here and that I should just shut up about breaking up because he was never going to let me go. He was upset that I had told him in that way but relieved that he now knew and was able to help and be a support. He understood where I was coming from and understood that it wasn't because I didn't trust him. He was scared of losing me, not to the end of this relationship but to cancer and just wanted to be updated and kept in the loop. Then he made me promise to swear off the vodka for a while and he kissed me and we went and got pizza.

Hi

It was hard

I went over. Sat with him on the couch. He put his arm around my shoulder. I told him I can't do this anymore because I think he's wonderful and I want to be with him, etc. 

I continued by telling him that I don't want to share him with whooo knows who else anymore. He evaded and said that ""it's not like there's a ton of other girls."" I simply responded

And just like that, but then it will start getting better.

Thanks guys.

I thought I would update you all on how this whole thing went down.  Definitely not what I expected.
A couple days after thinking about it

He had more to say about it than I'd expected.  He had no qualms with it, good.)

He further explained that while it was acceptable for girls to propose, yes, it's progressive for the woman to be the one proposing - but for gender *equality* it's still accomplishing nothing.  His stance was basically that a) proposals should never be a 100% surprise and b) the couple should decide together when the right time is.  Being a bit hazy from drinking (and never the most tactful person as it is), I asked if it was the right time.  He said that it was definitely time and we should go to the mall tomorrow - our local mall is packed with jewelers - and take a look around.

We went to a couple stores before finding one that treated us amicably.    It took about half an hour to pick out the ring we both liked for me.  He had his heart set on a titanium or tungsten band that could stand up to his line of work.  There were maybe a dozen bands to chose from

Total bill was somewhere around $450.  We paid 20% to have them put on layaway and went home to see where we could find money.  When I said he had a lot of debt, which actually makes it *very* easy to keep an eye on your spending.  After a month and a half of this, we've already paid a lot down on his debts and still had an easy time finding the rest of the money we owed on the rings.  We went back the very next day to pick them up.

He drove me out to a place neither of us had been in years - the first place where he hugged me, one lone person we hadn't noticed about 100 yards away began clapping and cheering.  I got flustered by this, forgot what I had wanted to say and totally dropped the ball on my returned proposal. xD

Friends and family have been very positive and supportive and we are planning a cheap wedding for mid to late 2013.  He is going to help plan that

**TL;DR: asked boyfriend and, so we talked it out like rational adults and decided it was time (a few months ahead of schedule).**

P.S: If anyone was curious, expensive ring that we couldn't afford.  When I said again that I would NOT be happy with that and told him my reasons, he said that he was happy to buy me a cheap ring if it was what I wanted, despite whatever backlash we may receive.  When I tell people I picked it myself and that all the money we saved will help us with more productive things - the wedding costs, for example, or the vacation - they seem generally understanding... especially the guys, lol.

The problem is with his son. I think that Bret has always resented our relationship and his parents' divorce. I've done my best to befriend him, but he has always been cold and distant. That changed about a year ago, when he started to be a bit more kind and polite. He used to not listen when I would ask him to do simple things like clean up after himself or keep his clutter in his room. He used to talk back to me or mock me or even just tell me to ""fuck off"". HIs father was never around when this happened and when I would tell his father later he would say that Bret ""didn't mean it"" or ""was going through a teen thing"". It was difficult, but never having kids of my own I trust Mike to know his own kids. By all accounts Bret is a great kid - he gets great grades, he plays sports, he's in the scouts - so at least he doesn't drink or use drugs.

Things changed about two weeks ago. I was finishing laundry and putting it away. I went to Bret's room and knocked on the door. I didn't think he would be home because of lacrosse practice so when he didn't answer I opened the door. He was naked, but he was staring straight at me. I said sorry and closed the door. But I felt like he meant for me to see him like that. He didn't try to hide it. His father came home and I didn't mention it. When Bret came to dinner he was quiet. Since then he has started doing things like brushing his crotch against my waist when he passes me in the kitchen. He has walked in on me in my bedroom and says things like he was ""looking for a magazine"" and didn't think I was home. He has, on multiple occasions tried to come into the bathroom about 30 seconds after I go in. I didn't used to lock the door, but now I do. The final ""straw"" was last weekend. My husband got up and went to the gym at 6 AM like he does every sunday before we go to church. I was asleep and when I woke up he was in bed spooning me with an erection pressed into my back. I reached back and touched him and that's when I realized it wasn't my husband. I jumped up and ran into the bedroom - still half asleep I thought someone had broken in and was attempting to rape me. It wasn't until I had locked myself in the bathroom that I found out it was my stepson.

Since then, Bret interrupted and said ""If you say anything I'll tell the adults at school and anyone who will listen that you tried to fuck me. So you should get used to it.""

I don't know what to do. I don't know if my husband would think I was crazy

TL;DR - My (30sF) stepson (16M) attempted to have sex with me and is blackmailing me to keep me from telling anyone by saying he will tell people that I tried to have sex with him.

The boy- he really is a boy, as long as she stops sneaking around and staying the night. He delivers pizza and lays carpet, but is going to school for carpentry. He is a former foster kid and they met through her friend Ana, 17, who is dating his roommate, 18, that just graduated last year from high school.

I let him leave after I talked to him a little bit. Bigger concerns and all that. Then I sat Maddie down and laid it out. I knew she had been sneaking around and lying

And she cried and said that it wasn't like that. They always used a condom but she was worried anyways. And she loved Trevor so much and that she knew I would try and limit her access to him but she just wanted to be with him when she could.

I let her know that was unacceptable. That I am her parent and I need to know about her life. And that she couldn't hole up with her boyfriend and place house all weekend. It would limit her and is unhealthy for a 16 year old kid.

Then we had an awkward sex talk.. She agreed to go on the pill and we are scheduling an appointment asap. I then explained to her, that just because she started doesn't mean she can't stop, and if she ever feels uncomfortable she can say no. That she shouldn't feel like she has to do anything.

My husband left his phone at home. For some reason I've had this weird niggling of doubt in the back of my mind. 
I snooped. And I don't care I did. 



What I found. No I don't think he is currently cheating. But he was. We were long distance back in 2011. He messaged many, some ""normal"" ones. Some of these pics he sent to me! Saying ""thinking about you!"" etc. Some of these it's obvious he fucked them bc of stuff like ""had fun"" ""coming over to fuck?"" etc. Some of them it's obvious he never even met the ladies, got bored w them and dropped them. 




The biggest shocker.... He fucked another guy. He sent a received several dick pics and said stuff like ""can't wait for that to be in me!"" and the guy said ""good, he made me feel like a piece of shit. Said things like he was afraid he couldn't satisfy me bc I'm into girls, said I'd leave him. I've since come to the conclusion it was fun to experiment, but I am straight. He even once said I'd done ""way more crazy stuff"" sexually than him! I've slept w a few guys, I've had two MFF threesomes (the threesomes were the only time I've been w other women). He saw this guy last spring and summer, right before we moved in together in September! Also a big shocker for me bc he is just soooo ""straight."" Our sex has always been good but fairly vanilla. He's never asked me to touch/fuck him in the ass. He loves anal with me but what guy doesn't? But he doesn't even push it we haven't done it in ages (yes I'm aware that not all guys do anal, and that if a guy likes anal doesnt mean he's gay. Just adding info here).




I'm not only heart broken




Oh my god I'm shaking. I seriously feel this is a fucked up dream. I had a dream a couple weeks ago he gave me herpes. I have a history of dreaming things before they become a reality so I am scared shitless. If I have anything it would be from him. I was also tested before we had sex and have only been w him since. 




What do I do? How do I confront him? From the texts and emails it appears he stopped this behavior finally in August (yup, so in love w me, told me I was so beautiful, the girl of his dreams. There was nothing like that in any of the other texts or emails, just sex. It appears I'm the only one he had a romantic interest in. 



Please tell me how to handle this. Should I even bring it up tonight when he gets home? I have literally no one to talk to about this.

&gt; **Original TL;DR:** 
&gt; Neighbor saw my porn drive

OK

I need to stress that I didn't want my talk with him to be about me telling him I'm right and he's wrong, ""I need to understand why you feel the way you do.""

Just before lunch I knocked on my neighbor's door and asked if I could speak with him.  He wasn't happy to see me but he agreed to come over to my house to chat

I asked him why he thought I was a child molester

I didn't deny that I had porn, and that I ""often watched it with my ex-girlfriend.""  I asked him why he thought it was child porn, or if he just thought any porn meant I was some sort of deviant.

His first reaction was to tell me, ""Pictures of kids and videos of people having sex.""  I asked him if he had looked through the whole drive and saw context around the pictures, and he just got this disgusted look on his face, ""No I didn't look through the whole drive!""  He claimed that he turned on a media server and it auto-detected the media because it was still on my network because the wifi password on the device was hard to change and he hadn't changed it back form when his cable modem broke.  He said his kids only normally used the device for Netflix, so he had kind of forgotten about it once things were working again.  His explanation seemed a little wordy, but I let him talk as long as he wanted.

Anyway it was super awkward at this point, like I said in the previous post.  But he said he hadn't seen them this way before, what he saw was all of the files in a unified view, without the folder structure.  And he only took a quick glance at the thumbnails when he went to watch a movie with his wife and kids.

It was in front of his wife and kids.  Repeat: Super Awkward...

I apologized that happened.  And I am really sorry that his kids saw it.  Not sure how much they would have seen given it was just thumbnails... I looked again, but by this point he was warming up again to the idea that the whole thing was just a huge mistake and misunderstanding.  I offered to let him take the drive to the cops, I was that certain there wasn't child porn on it.  He said he believed me.

He told me the reason he was so disgusted by porn was that it had ""ruined his sister's marriage"" and he now had to support her.  That his sister's husband would watch porn so much that he lost his job and became an alcoholic and ended up being abusive to his wife and kids (he didn't say, and I would never be happy as long as I looked at it.  (Hey, there's some slight truth to that, for some people at least.)  He told me there was a support group at his church for pornography addiction and asked me if I would be interested in going.  I sheepishly told him I would check it out.  That seemed to put his mind at ease.  He said he was sorry he jumped to conclusions.

Candidly I don't know if I believe his story 100%.  I know my TV only shows titles, but it's possible his kids saw something through their media server... 

So of course I don't have any intention of going to a porn support group

**TL;DR:** Had a good talk with my neighbor.  Things aren't 100% fixed

EDIT: Wanted to put a little more down about what he told me.  His speech was basically, to get off.  You can't have porn and a happy marriage.""  I don't agree 100%, but I do think the guy's heart is in the right place.  As much as Reddit hates on religious people... it was kind of sweet to hear things like that said in 2013.

And... This whole thing has got me thinking more about the context of information.  Not to get all political, and **POOF**, you're on your way to Guantanamo.

Hope it's alright that I post here. Promise no more screenshots! I got a lot of messages asking how things were going

Anyway

Here's what I've gathered so far...

- In one of her e-mails, so I lied."" 

- She admits cheating on me the entire time we've been together and it's been more guys than even her mom knew about. Most were guys she met at work (she works with *a lot* of men) and even friends of ours, and I wasn't fulfilling her desires. She then goes into some huge rant about how she knew I'd never be comfortable with an open relationship so she never brought it up and figured I wouldn't find out, so I wouldn't get hurt. 

- She flips back and forth from begging to being super bitchy. Apparently doesn't like her little world being flipped upside down.

- Despite ALL of her e-mails asking to if we can work it out, and if I'll ever forgive her, she's staying with the guy she's been banging for the past 7-8 months. Woohoo. 

Aside from all of this, but I still feel like it hasn't hit me yet. 

My brother planned a guys night this weekend with some friends (guess who's included? John) so hopefully that'll help take my mind off things for the time being... just trying to stay busy.

Regarding the construction contract, business-like voicemail with no undertones of anger, frustration, or anything that would give away that we had any sort of romantic relationship. I stated that I wanted a contract to be drawn up before any work continues just to cover both of us when it comes to the legality of it. He never called back so I called the other owner of the company who had a contract and a complete price and time estimate for us both to sign the very next day. 


He (the other owner) asked if I had any questions or concerns about anything going on and I vaguely told him that his business partner and I had a relationship and that we had a bit of a falling out and I was slightly worried that my ex SO would sabotage some of the work being done. He immediately apologized and assured me that all the work being done would be professional and the best they had to offer. Then said that they will have an outside company come in to inspect all work once the job is complete to ensure the quality of everything before they will accept final payment. I can't begin to explain how thankful I am for that to have went so smoothly.


I mentioned in the previous post that I sent a message to the girl my ex claimed he was 'just friends' with to let her know that I had just found him naked in bed with another woman who was not her, asked for picture proof, and then said she would like to speak with me on the phone. 


She called me and the first thing out of her mouth was ""I have fifty questions for you, talking about engagement, planning the same types of events, avoiding, acting super shady on days that the other girl would be around, mentioning of any suspicious behavior was 'irrational' and that we were 'thinking too much') and sending her the same pictures he was sending to me. She was just as shocked as I was at the whole situation. We talked for a good hour and by the end of it she said ""Had you not done this the way you did it would be so easy to hate you, but I can't."" She was incredibly nice, and we talked again once on the phone after that and haven't had contact since. 


Once my ex SO realized I was talking to her, this time it was a pretty lengthy apology detailing how he found himself trying to live two lives and he didn't even know which one he even wanted. He said he deserved the water, understands why I am upset, and that he regrets not being an honest person. Then continued on to say he doesn't expect me to speak to him again, but if I'd like we could continue a professional relationship until the construction job is completed. He concluded with ""Again I'm sorry. The least I can do is finish the job I started and walk away from your life forever."" I never responded. 


All of my contact for anything shop/job related is now through his business partner. My ex SO has not been on the property working since the day he sent that message. With his business partner's crew I have had TRIPLE the amount of people working than I was used to seeing before. In the past week I have seen more progress than the last few months combined. 


Since all of this happened


**TL;DR -** Got a construction contract signed by both parties. All contact is now through the other owner who promised a full inspection before receiving final payment. The job is being completed even faster than before and is looking amazing. Found out that ex SO was dating me and another girl at the same time

I [25M]will be attending a wedding a few hours away from my home this weekend and my girlfriend [21F] is extremely angry at me about it. She's saying I betrayed her by agreeing to be a groomsman. I didn't even know I was a groomsman until I got the text from my buddy mentioning the tuxedo rental and deadline. I was honored he chose me to be a groomsman and continued on.

Two weeks ago my girlfriend says she's not going because the couple getting married didn't respond to her congratulations message on facebook. They barely use their facebook

She finally agrees to come after I tell her she's going for me and even though I'll be busy with the party we can still see each other at the reception and hang out. It would only be from 10am-6pm that we're away from each other. After the ceremony the wedding party takes a limo to the reception hall and then we can hang out.

I can not, it was my computer screen in the other room), had dreams of her returning home in the middle of the night only to wake up saddened. I completed my final and presented my final project today with all of this stress on my mind (did awesome btw). 

I have only texted her back 1 message about the feeding the cat and I'm not going to get into a text war about this anymore. A few moments ago I texted her ""Kitty and I miss our mami very much and we hope to see you in the near future. I'll feed her before I head to work if you don't return home by then. Kitty said ""meow meow"" which translates to I miss and love my mami and I told her I feel the exact same way. Love you hope you're feeling better. Muah""

To which she replied she feels just as betrayed as when I slept with that ""whore"" when we were broken up 2 years ago. Apparently she has found a forum online which proves I am 100% wrong and what she is feeling/doing is completely normal. Now she's saying she doesn't want to be in a relationship with me anymore and how ""The saddest part is that you do not acknowledge any of this""

She's saying shes going to come pick up the cat when I'm at work and going to write a letter saying we broke up (I'm assuming to end our lease) She finished off the text with ""...I don't care anymore just like you have shown me you don't. Shame on you. Goodbye""

I replied with ""wow"" I honestly don't know what to say.

Seriously

Any input would be greatly appreciated.

**Edit1:** She said this in one of the text messages last night ""I wish you would have said no thanks [name of groom]

Also called me a traitor a few times.

**Edit2:** I did get irrational and upset initially when she told me she didn't want to go. I probably should have just let it play out but I was offended that my girlfriend that I planned on marrying one day would be this petty over someone else' big day like this. I thought I would look stupid sitting with an empty seat next to me and having to explain to everyone that asked ""hey man where's your girlfriend"" and either a) have to lie or b)make my girlfriend look really stupid. I told my buddy the real story but wouldn't feel comfortable telling everyone else what happened. Again I should have just accepted it but I was upset and kept trying to get her to go by saying ""You're doing this for me and you're going to make me look stupid etc""

**EDIT3:** The case is solved. She thinks I should have gotten her consent to be a groomsman and the part of the conversation she cried the most was that I would walk down the aisle with a bridesmaid while she is in the audience. Also she was mad at the schedule I had made where while I was doing the rehearsal she would hang out and wait and when we were done we would all go hang out a a bar together then crash at my buddies that night. This was in effort to save 1 night of hotel fees. Then Saturday I was going to duck out of the hotel for an hour or two to hang out with my buddy. Sunday since I'm leaving early to prep(10am) I said I would bring anything she didn't need to get get ready in my truck and request a late check out since the ceremony begins at 3. Then she was supposed bring my truck to the ceremony then drive it to the reception hall where we would meet (since Im in the limo with the rest of the wedding party).

That's when we were gonna meet then I was gonns drive 4 hours home into the night while she napped to get her back for work by Monday morning. Shes pissed

**EDIT4:** A few people have made valid points about her wanting to get engaged/married and that being a factor in her behavior. I'm currently working part time security at a defense contractor making 12 bucks an hour and have 3 semesters left on my computer science degree. I cant afford the ring at the moment, I want to marry once. My parents had a very cold marriage when I was young (separate bedrooms for as long as I can remember, no physical contact or love shown. They ignored each other and dint speak for most of my childhood but they're better now) This has caused me to be emotionally distant at times (I've come a long way, hence my beta attempt at trying to be cute). Ive got a lot of things I need to work on on myself stemming from a deployment and childhood. I'm simply not ready emotionally or financially to get married. Shes an awesome person and I found love for the first time when I met her and besides minor occurrences we have an awesome relationship and we enjoy each others company. Shes the only person I've considered marriage with.",Relationships,False,,1372386189.0,t3_1h6yrr

It went really, and that we both really wanted to be in a relationship together and I wanted his blessing. I was expecting a terrible response based on what people here told me but it went fine. He said he kind of suspected something was up between the two of us and that as long as I treat his daughter well he has no issue. I promised him I wouldn't hurt Sara and he gave us his approval. 

What I was scared about was the age difference but Jon never mentioned it or said I was too old for his daughter. Sara talked to her dad later that day and he apparently just asked her background questions - like does he treat you well

Thanks to everyone that chimed in with advice and the users that helped me plan out what I was going to say. You all were so helpful and I don't know how I would have handled the talk without the help. Such amazing advice on /r/relationships. Thank you!

It's hard for me to write this down


He is extremely passive-aggressive but I think that there might be something else wrong with him but I can't convince him to go to a therapist.  Well, blah blah blah. 



 I'll just explain the worst problems I'm having with him and if you need any detail



Throughout our marriage I've had to put up with hidden cameras, sex tapes that were taken without my knowledge, etc.  I've walked into his shed and found a computer hooked up with nothing but pictures and movies of me - the wallpaper was a picture of my vagina.  What if my kids needed something from the shed and saw that????  When I confronted him he says it's because I'm beautiful and he wants more sex.  It's not that I wasn't giving him sex (3-4 times a week seemed plenty, right?), but I figured if it stopped him from invading my privacy I would help.  So I increased the sex, but he didn't stop.  One night in the middle of sex I thought I saw a flash of light so I immediately knew there was a camera.  I contronted him but he said I was crazy because he told me he would never do that again.  I just didn't believe him so I looked around and sure enough, there was a camera.  I was so hurt and angry, but I think in my case it's justified.  I do NOT want pictures of me like that on any computers or
cell phones.  He's notorious for for losing his phone



 A couple months ago he was in the kitchen with his phone.  I was standing right next to him when turned it on to make a call and I saw that the wallpaper of his phone was another picture of me that he promised he deleted.  I was mad and hurt, peepholes, etc.  It's so much work to do this that I'm lucky to shower 3 times a week because it's tiring.  I can't shower when he's home because I've caught him in the bathroom with a camera peeking around the corner of the closet. 



You might be thinking that this isn't really a big deal, but he kept following me!  I kept saying nicely ""please stop, this isn't a hug, please stop, etc."" but he wouldn't listen and I got to the point where I was so mad and trapped that I just grabbed his balls to get him off of me and screamed ""why won't you listen to me!!!!!!!"".  This made him so mad that he punched a hole in the wall, broke a door and drove off screaming that I'm a bitch.  I'm not a bitch.  I just probably didn't handle it right even though after 20 years of begging him to stop he still isn't listening to me so I just got desperate.  I was really sorry and ran out to his car to apologize but he just drove off saying that I punched him.  I didn't punch him!  I grabbed him.  



But he does tend to over dramatize things.  If I'm wanting to communicate and try to fix our problems he just doesn't want to talk so he talks over me, let him leave, and cry by myself.  And then when he comes home he walks in like nothing happened and sits down to watch tv.  If I say ""please can we talk"" (trust me, I say this in the nicest quietest voice possible so that he doesn't think I'm attacking him), he just jumps up to leave screaming ""Whatever!"", or ""Fuck this!"".  And walks away again.  Nothing is ever resolved.  20 years of the same fucking problems never being solved.  If I try to fix something he says ""are you still holding on to this?"".  Well, yeah.  I kinda am because it has nowhere to go because the problem was never solved.  That's how I am - if theres a problem, it's over and gone.  Easy peasy.  The times when he actually does listen



Going back to his obsession with cameras and porn:  The other day I actually found pictures of my sister on his computer.  Not naked pictures, or she WILL say something to him.  So now I'm worried that eventually she will do that or tell her boyfriend and HE will. So she stopped answering texts and calls which pissed him off.  He was texting her ""why are you ignoring me"" texts until he finally said ""FUCK IT!"".  Why did he even care that she was ignoring him?  He never cares when he's ignoring ME!  God forbid anybody ignore him.  She has never liked him but was always nice to him because of me.  But she said she's not going to be nice anymore.  Christmas is going to be fun this year.  Not.



There are other things: 


-he gets fired a lot or passed up for raises.  His reason is that it's because he works harder than everybody else so people don't like him and are jealous.  He's late for work all the time and when I try to get him to get out the door on time he says ""fuck 'em"".  



-he won't take care of the house and if I tell him somethings broken he gets mad and says ""I'm not a fucking maintenance man"".  When he finally does get around to fixing it he doesn't finish or doesn't do it right.  We went a long time this winter without heat.  His solution?  Here's a space heater!!  So when he finally fixed the heater it wasn't fixed properly.  It wouldn't shut off and it would just get hotter and hotter.   So our electric bill was $500 last month.  Yeah



-he doesn't spend time with his kids.  If something goes wrong with them he says ""you must be doing something wrong"".  When he gets home from work he goes straight to his room to look at porn and then goes to sleep.




-I have one plate



-He says he's going to a friends house and will be back in a couple hours.  He never does.  He shuts off his phone and then doesn't come home till 3 or 4 in the morning.  And I'm not supposed to say anything about it.  ""I'm a grown man and I can do what I want"" is always his reply.  You know, etc.



There is so much more but I'm tired.  I would like to say that I used to be such an awesome girl.  I went to college



I know that someone is going to say ""just leave him"".  Well I've tried that.  He threatens to take the kids




Does anybody have any idea how I can get him into therapy?  Is there something wrong with him other than being passive-aggressive?  





tl;dr  I've wasted half my life with a psycho.

Been together over a year.


I'm leaving him. I went to see a free crisis therapist and they helped me call him to tell him what was going on. I'm getting a restraining order


He was sorry and said he under stood and he'd leave to his parents in a few hours and stay there. I got a police escort home when he said he left


This is hard and heartbreaking for me...



Also, I didn't. I really did only toss them and he even admitted that after he hit my head into the wall that he realized how insignificant my act had been. It wasn't aimed at him, the fish, or the wall and it wasn't hard.


I do get out of the house every day without him and go on walks. I love my alone time redditing and such and want to make friends. I don't follow him around all day, just not all the time.


The argument was that he did tell me positives, so what does he really think? No, I wasn't calm or collected, yes I did cry and not accept the good he said. Yeah, I am part of the reason we had the argument, but I didn't do anything that deserved my head put into a wall and a fucked up face...

Both of us were raised in the foster system

Recently: My biological father passed away which meant little to nothing to me since my foster father adopted me and has been absolutely great. However.. The woman I am with also received an invitation to the funeral because its her dad also.

Shes already packed up her things and is staying with her best friend. This situation is so screwed up I honestly didn't believe things like this could happen. I'm torn.. I really am, she won't speak to me anymore.

Just as more background.. Yes we have spoken about our pasts before

TL;DR: Found out the woman I have been seeing and saying 'I love you' too is actually my younger sister. Now more then ever I wished I had kept in contact with my biological family. What the hell do I do?

TL;DR of the above:
I have a horrible boss

This weekend I have caught Flu and feel like death. Non the less, bought myself a double shot americano and went in to the lions den. He called me into the board room as soon as I walked through the door.

He made a point about how he was in control. How I WAS tied into a three month contract and how he could sue me for the cost of getting a contractor in (£350 a day) to cover my position for the remainder of my contractual notice.

We waived his stupid arms around to show who had the power.

I said nothing. I nodded and sipped my coffee.

Then he paused and said he'd considered it carefully and he is going to let me go next Thursday. He said he's prefer not to give me a personal reference and he is removing my admin privileges (I'm the IT Manager).

Even if he had continued down the line he started

I won't get paid for the bank holidays (meh!) because of my release date and he sent me home today on unpaid sick leave (I need the rest and the sun is shining in my city today :) but I don't even care. I'm FREEEE. I can't stop smiling.

It's my 1 year anniversary and my SO is taking me for a beach break this weekend. I've booked myself in for a nice long massage next week too.

I've also just had a phone call from another company bidding for a higher daily rate for my freelance services. 

I have learned a lot about how people work through this nightmare. I understand my worth as a professional and I think I'll be a better at standing up for myself in future. Also

Which I disagree with but, whatever. He then asked me to leave him out of it and not tell my husband that he told me anything about it.

He has been acting completely normal for the past few months, and I have been having trouble not crying everytime he talks to me.

Please help. I have no idea how to handle this. I know I should confront him but what should I say? Should I stay with him or move out? Should I tell the police?

1) What did the 4 am text say?

My life ""ended"" the day she broke up with me. I cried, I did everything that you are all probably going through. It feels like your whole world is turned upside down and you do not know where to turn.

Hang in there

It's hard and it's painful, I've dated 5 different women since the break-up. I didn't jump right into dating, I took the time to be happy as me again, it's important to take the time and reflect on the things you did wrong. I know I made mistakes but I learned from them and I became a better man for them. 

It's a struggle but keep your head up, being healthy physically will help more then anything else.

He's coming home from work in an hour or so. He's still there (it's a pub). I am having difficulty calming down. I've been having contractions all day and he knows this. I was teary eyed earlier because I was feeling weirded out by his behavior and was communicating with him about it. I wasn't accusing him of anything, yes. IDGAF; I was right to. He lied to my face seconds between requests for an ass shot without panties. I called him and confronted him. He said he had to go, there was a fight or something. I'm kicked off Facebook, the password changes, and suddenly I can't log onto Verizon. I am in physical and emotional pain.

I also have a daughter who is in LOVE with this man. She is 7 years old and from a previous marriage (one where my husband cheated and stopped speaking to both of us). How the fuck. Why the fuck. I'm at a complete and utter loss.

Another kicker? HE JUST GOT HIRED WHERE I WORK.

1367894577.0,1du69q,My girlfriend[F27] of 9 years is on a walk with another man[M50's] and she doesn't know that I[M25] know the truth.,sman28,579,130,262,"Well it is kind of a long story but basically we have been together for 9 years now. She is a female

She started acting weird at the beginning of April. It was up and down

Well there has been this co-worker of hers who I believe is in his 50's. When I first learned of him she made sure to note that they are just friends and that I wouldn't be jealous because he is old. Maybe she was being honest and just wanted to be only friends with him at first

Well anyways this last month has sucked to say the least, together at least every other day or so. Basically tons of date nights all month long. On these dates she acts pretty normal and seems appreciative... but then soon after she is back to the ups and downs. Any time I asked her what was wrong she would just beat around the bush and just say she needed ""alone"" time.

Now during the beginning of April she quit her job she had with that older co-worker for a new job that pays a lot better. Oh and I should mention, either going on walks, going to his place for lunch to chat, ect.

I knew something was up

Normally I would NEVER read someones diary

In the diary she says basically she has feelings for this ex co-worker of hers. And she has used this diary strictly for writing about every visit she has had with him such as the walks shes been going on with him. It is how she feels about how it went and if he will ever see her as more than a friend. I knew something was going on but reading this made my heart snap in two.

In the middle of our relationship I should mention we broke up for about 2 years and got back together 4 years ago. We were young and I just marked off us breaking up as us just her not knowing what she wanted because of us being young at the time. Now I feel like an idiot.

Basically from what I got from the diary she wants to be with this older guy but he isn't giving the signals she's looking for and seems to only want to be her friend. This guys ex wife cheated on him with another man and left him for this man. Strangely he is friends with this other man his ex wife is with now

Either way from what I read it sounds like she doesn't want to leave me though if she can't be with him... Sure feels good be be second! Especially to a guy that could be her father.. no offense to those with age gap relationships

So that is the situation... she is on a walk with him right now and I just couldn't take it anymore and had to tell someone

The worst part right now is that I can't stand the thought of him touching her in ways only I have since I'm the only relationship she has been in... I know it's weird but thinking of the idea of him kissing her

She could do so much better than him too

So the fact she is basically cheating on me in my mind, I'm just a mess right now. Also I made the big mistake of getting 3 joint credit cards filled with debt with her so that'll be interesting if we break up again... 

I want to be with her til the day I die

Sorry this came out so long

My eyes are too watery and red to re-read this for errors

I want to stay with her but she just pushes me away when I try to do stuff for her to make sure she feels loved.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As suggested I'm going to copy and paste my updates here I made below... hopefully I'm doing this right... 

**Update 1 (kind of just more details about her childhood, she had some mental issues and refused to see a doctor.. her dad slept in a separate room because of this and he basically ignored her mother. Her mom would lash out verbally to her from time to time and she would have to use earplugs in the night so she couldn't hear her mom yelling at the tv or something. Her father has apologized recently to her about how he tried to ignore the way her mother was acting. So not sure if she see's this older man as a father figure or something..
In fact she told me later after we got back together that the phone call I answered when she called me right before we got back together when she was all crying

**Update 2:** She just sent me a text saying ""I'm gonna hang out for a bit longer. Is that ok?""
I'm sure they are hanging out at his place

**Update 3:** Well here is the update. She got home all cheery and calling me sweety like nothing is wrong... she ran off to the bathroom before I could say anything

When she came out I told her we have to talk. I started to ask her questions giving her a chance to fess up and she admitted that there were some problems and I told her we are going to sit down and talk about it tomorrow. I think she was surprised how serious I sounded and didn't expect it.

I felt really angry when I saw her come in

I have the journal with me now and will show it to her when we get up.. this should be interesting..

Thank you for all the advice

I'll update you all really soon if your still around in the morning! I'm sure I'm going to need some advice after we talk..

EDIT: I'm not sure if I should look and see her newest entry from today... not sure I want to know. I have a pretty good idea already what I'm going to say to her now. I've pretty much accepted what is going on now. ;p

--------------------------------------------------

**Update 4:** I barely got any sleep and stayed up really late because of all this. I'm really tired but I was going to confront her about it anyways right then

My head hurts and it is hard to think clearly right now... she knows I'm upset and that I'm serious so she stopped trying to beat around the bush and is realizing the reality of everything I believe. If she tried to dodge my questions I probably would of said that's it right then and there but she was forward with me.

I feel like some sleep will do me good and I think I already feel better enough since I started to confront her about it that I can actually rest a bit. I think I'll be able to say everything I want to clearly tomorrow...

It'd be nice if we could remain friends after all this

I really feel like you all helped me confront her with this

----------------------------------------------------

**Update 5:** I read it.. Basically says he is moving in 2 months and he wants her to be his room mate. She asked him if he thought they could ever be more than friends and he said yes. He also said to her that he was really close to kissing her... and he said he was very attracted to her. Then she goes on to say that everything she wanted to happen or hear happened. And finishes it with ""Now what... this is a lot to process.""

Had a feeling it was something like this being she was gone for so long on a ""walk."" Well I guess this just solidifies everything and there was no hope and it is time for me to move on.. trying to stay strong now.. I knew I was pretty much ending it but still hard to read this.. why him of all people... I feel a bit nauseous..

I guess I gave him too much credit thinking he was being respectful of my situation.. but I guess if it wasn't him it would of been someone else. I just wish she was single for awhile

EDIT: She mentioned that he said he had a room mate for 4 months once and it was a FWB situation and he preferred that more than a relationship. I have a feeling he's having similar ideas with her now. I don't know if I should try to help her realize this or just focus on getting out of this situation and leave her to figure it out..

------------------------------------------------------

**Update 6:** wow... this post got a ton of comments... I'll make this mini update then start reading these replies..

So I just woke up and she is still sleeping. I think I'm glad I slept first

I'm gonna start reading some replies and post again.. someone mentioned last night to update the main post with all the updates

Thank you everyone

-------------------------------------------------------

**Update 7:** I read all the posts and man there is a lot to take in and a lot of really good advice. She is still sleeping which I can't believe being 5pm already.. She goes into work at 11pm

First off I saw this whole her being a virgin thing got quite a response.. when we were first together we got really close to doing it but it started to hurt too much before anything got.. erm.. in... and she paniced and it stopped right there. We always planned to return to it and try again but she has always just been too scared. She has like super sensitive skin

I've tried to get her to see a gyno (she never has) but every time she got close to going she chickened out because she thought the thing they insert was going to hurt too much and she is also SUPER shy about being touched

Well anyways before we got another chance to try again that was when our break of 2 years happened. Then we got back together

I had her drive down to where I live and she moved in with me when I was living with my parents (it is a condo that is separated for a room mate I guess, ever since. Then we focused on getting our own place, saving up to move into the place we are in today.

We brought up the idea of sex quite a few times while saving up money and we would buy a new bottle of lube each time (they kept expiring). But she really just kept getting too scared. I don't consider myself a very sexual person but I wouldn't mind sex either for sure(my left hand was my fwb.. lol). So I just never really ""pushed"" her hard for it. We made it kind of a ""prize"" to get our own place together and we would do it then, maybe go see that gyno and we would try it, heck I thought she wasn't going anywhere so what was the hurry... and the idea of waiting for marriage popped up a few times but it was just more of an excuse to put it off..

And no I am not religious in any way what so ever, and the rest of her family is SUPER Christian.. I guess her family use to live in a village in China before they came over to the US (she however was born in the US) and it sounds like it was quite a Christian village.. but her herself is not religious at all really..

Well anyways she is still sleeping and getting ready to say what I need to say

Well that is what I got so far

Edit: Btw I don't know if this matters but we do have rings and we were planning on getting married but we just wanted to make sure we had enough money to have a nice one and it wasn't super important to be married

-----------------------------------------------------

**Update 8:** Damnit

Edit: Clarifying that I will still be here on cousins computer to read/reply to more replies.

-----------------------------------------------------

**Update 9:** Hey all, that is for sure. I totally had it planned out to go in my head one way but as I started to talk I realized a lot about myself and it went a whole other direction.

Are we staying together as a couple? No

I will give you all the details really soon

Again thank you all so very much. You may all be internet strangers but I feel like you are all close friends to me in some weird way now

Thank you.

------------------------------------------------------

**Update 10:**

Okay

While we have a ton in common and I love her so much

It hit me then that we make much better friends

I realize now that I deserve much better. I'm always looking out on how to help others and so focused on what others want that I never really looked at what ""I"" want. And looking back I wasn't treated the way one should be

I went in the bedroom and saw she was awake. I laid down and asked her about her day. I asked her if she wants to talk about what is going on and she replied with ""No"" while looking away from me. I ask again and she quickly replies again with ""No."" We laid there for about 5 minutes quietly and then she starts bawling. I start tearing up a bit.

She asked how long I knew something wasn't right and I told her a month ago I could tell something was up with her. Which she replies with ""You know me so damn well"" and I said ""I know."" I explained what I realized and she agreed with everything I had to say. We both laughed a bit while passing the tissue back and forth.

We talked about what we want in life and she realizes now that she needs to focus on herself. What she wants to achieve and where she wants to be. I helped her realize that she is trying to fill the void of being unhappy with herself with a relationship, rather than trying to use a partner to fill it.

So we are giving our two months notice to the apartment complex and moving out. We are going to try to remain friends but we will see how that works out.

I feel sad that it couldn't work out but excited for what the future holds for me. I'm going to focus a lot more on me now and hopefully be able to share my accomplishments with someone I truly love and who truly loves me.

I am content. :)

Thank you so much from the bottom of my heart reddit. You guys and gals are awesome.

1355318849.0,14q2m8,UPDATE: I [28] found some mildly inappropriate text messages on my wifes [29] cell phone from a groomsmen from a recent wedding she went to.,fiend_factory,578,133,204,"Original: http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/14nx3z/i_28_found_some_mildly_inappropriate_text/

First I want to say thank you to everyone who gave their input to my situation.  I appreciate the wide range of opinions and points of view and this really helped me approach this situation in a manner that was calm

First, but she understood why people said what they did.  Everyone saw my side of the story, other people warned about this, and Reddit defended one of their own.

After work I came home and we had a very long conversation.  She told me up front that nothing beyond what I know had happened, unbecoming of a married woman, and flat disgusting.  She told me she was very sorry and that she never meant for this to be so hurtful to me.  We both agreed that our blurry boundaries need to be redefined and she admitted at first she didn't see a problem but realized afterwards, before coming home, how that what she did was very inappropriate and felt she owed it to me to be honest.  A mutual friend of ours (the bride in this case) talked to me as well and said things did go to far but nothing happened beyond what I know.  While some will say that something like that could easily be planned and friends lie for each other I doubt this is the case.  Her friend was very happy that my wife did the right thing and she had encouraged her to just be honest about this and tell me when she came home.  She showed me the text messages her friend had sent and it all lined up with what I was told.  She had removed everything to do with Steve from her phone and she agreed that if he was to contact her again she would inform him that they will have zero contact, period.  My wife also wrote a letter (she is the only person I know who still writes physical letters) to all of the bridesmaids apologizing for her behavior and poor example she set and the disrespect she showed towards me and our marriage.  Rarely does she seem sorry but last night she was broken over how upset and hurt she made me.  She went as far to make one of my favorite childhood meals that absolutely disgusts her, fucking Hamburger Helper.  Other issues came to the surface as well that we discussed openly and honestly that helped fuel the aftermath of this incident.  Mostly we discussed that we need to continue to work on my insecurities and emotional baggage I carry from previous relationships.  She has no interest in Steve or other men and I need to understand that.  I am the man she married and there is a reason for that.  She was really worried I would come home and want to divorce her, and while what she did was grossly inappropriate

Someone did make a comment last night that pretty much summed up exactly what she felt.  She has recently begun having a hard time dealing with the idea of turning 30 soon and getting older.  She said she has had a hard time talking to me about  this because when she brings it up I just tell her she is being stupid and needs to get over it because 30 isn't anything.  She admitted she likes the male attention more so now because it makes her feel like she is still attractive and desirable to other men.  She also admitted she was lonely over the weekend and the alcohol fueled party atmosphere with her old college friends getting laid and her going home alone caused a lapse in judgement on what we define as okay in our relationship.  She knows I find her drop dead gorgeous but sometimes that external feeling of, I apologized to her about that.  I am emotional cold, I know this and I try to work on it.

We clearly set boundaries on this sort of thing.  Talk of that nature is saved for us and no one else

Some may say that I am an idiot and she is lying, I should divorce her, etc ...  I can understand the point of view but again one short, one sided story fails to even begin to scratch the surface of our relationship.  People fuck up, I know I do a lot.  We have a very good, loving, and honest relationship with each other and this is a mere bump in the road.  After some fun makeup sex we are moving on.

Again

TL;DR  She fucked up.  She knows she fucked up.  She was honest and came clean, there wont be contact with Steve.  Fuck Steve, Steve sucks.  She apologized, we defined boundaries, worked out some other issues.  Hamburger Helper followed by makeup sex.

[HH EDIT]

Some kind soul sent me this link in case you other HH aficionados are unaware: http://chickensintheroad.com/cooking/homemade-hamburger-helper/

I guess there is a silver lining in everything.

[EDIT 2]

Doubt anyone will see this but the plot thickens

http://i.imgur.com/lKYAc.png

The person who sent that had perfect details the complete match up so I am pretty sure the dude is legit.  Wife naturally says it is a lie but what guy lies about a handjob?  I am at wits end now with this.  I think I just need to talk to Steve directly

[EDIT 3]

So far the phone number I have turned up is bunk.  I do have the phone number of one of his friends I believe

I did message Steve on Facebook but it is obvious he hasn't used in probably about a year

[EDIT 4]

For the few that want to know the final chapter of this - everything worked out.  Went to the horses mouth and got everything cleared up, and to give the devil his dues, he was pretty stand up guy about all of it.  Steve on the other hand is quite upset with our friend bro-code-enforcer.  He wants me to tell him who this person is but honestly I don't know, bro-code-enforcer doesn't want to tell me ( I don't blame this person ), and that is the way it is.  Steve did ask, ""and who the fuck is Steve?""

If it wasn't clear, fixed some other minor issues, and have moved on and are continuing to enjoy having each other.",,False,,t5_2qjvn,,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/14q2m8/update_i_28_found_some_mildly_inappropriate_text/

First I'd like to say thank you all so much for the great advice. It really made me look at our relationship and think long and hard about whether I wanted it to continue.

To the people suggesting that I should help him by proofreading job applications, he has a learning disorder. I would have no problem with this but he has no intention of doing anything about it which is what I took issue with.

I realize now that yes

After reading your posts

I explained to him that since I was going to college and he was planning on going to the military, regardless of who it is with, and at this point I'm not even sure I want children at all.

It was an emotional conversation, I still want him to go somewhere in life and not be a deadbeat and I know this is something he wants and will be a good opportunity for him. He is currently arranging to meet with a recruiter within the next week.

I have no hard feelings for him and I wish him the best in life. He deserves a girl who loves him unconditionally for who he is and can overlook his bad traits and not be embarrassed by him and I deserve a guy who can mentally stimulate me and give me what I need from a relationship.

In the end it was a fun first relationship

Speaking of which she is not really my niece she is my girlfriend's sister's daughter. I've been dating her (girlfriend) for almost 5 years

Anyway to the matter at hand. Let's call her Sally, her uncle. I mean she always liked being close to me and touching me and giving me hugs and kisses on the cheek, but I thought that was a little girl being a little girl. I'm 24 give me a break. But this, THIS IS WTF. She flat out sent sent inappropriate pictures, asked me to take her virginity and basically have a secret relationship. I didn't keep it, I deleted it as soon as I got it, and frankly I'm scared. Shit like this puts people in jail or on sex offender list. I don't know if I should talk to her(I'm afraid to be alone with her now) or her parents(not sure what good that will do, but this may sound more like venting. This all happen last night by the way and I have been up all night worrying about it.

I know my girlfriend will have my back, but you should probably keep it out of the house hold you're raising 2 kids in. Which they have failed to do. I'm not really blaming that but maybe it had some negative effect. I don't know, I'm just shooting out thoughts. Sorry I don't know I just vehemently dont like the idea that my ""fate"" lies in the hands of a 17 year old girl. Fuck. Which is why I think talking to her maybe the worst option yet. Getting a lawyer, I'm not sure what that will bring about. Fleeing the country for 6 months doesn't realistic.

I don't know if its relevant, sally will actually be 18 in December. I'm about to have a meltdown. I don't even know if this the right sub to ask.

My wife and I (both 35) have been married for 2 years and I can't get any peace from her. She literally will not leave me alone for one second at home. She requires my full and undivided attention and usually actual physical contact at all times. She gets angry or creates some sort of drama if I try to check my phone

She keeps up a continual barrage of noise which is usually 99% complaining

She uses dramas of various kinds to get leverage, an eating disorder, suspected food poisoning, allergies, insomnia, anxiety, cancer scares, bladder and lung infections plus a million others I can’t remember. She’s had three jobs all of which have been the worst job in the world for various reasons; each accompanied by months of non-stop complaining. She has gotten into bitter feuds with at least half a dozen people including members of my family, all for unrelated reasons.

Quite often the dramas are blamed on me. For example I’ll cook dinner and it’ll turn out to contain something she’s allergic to which she’ll “discover” after she’s eaten three helpings. I suspect these things are mostly bullshit and used to maintain control over me. For example: in many relationships one person will stay up and read or watch TV or do whatever interests them after the other has gone to bed. Not so in my relationship, God forbid, go away somewhere without her) she accuses me of having cheated on her and subjects me to hours of interrogation when I get home. I have never cheated on her.

She rings me at work. She wakes me up at any time of the night if she needs attention for any spurious reason.

The closest I can get to some peace is if we watch TV together. Then, and provided I am willing to hit pause every time she experiences a need or an emotion, she actually shuts up for small periods of time.

Of course she comes and goes as she pleases and does whatever she wants whenever she wants. But I don't object because the brief times she's out of the house are golden. Sadly she doesn't really have many friends because she is hypersensitive to any perceived insult and usually will take offense at something during a conversation.

Financially she does 99% of the spending and about 5% of the contributing but I actually encourage her to go away on shopping trips. I'd gladly pay for a $5

I know you are probably thinking “get her some therapy”, she survived) but she was not honest with the therapist and then took offense to something she said. Most sadly of all I can’t dump her ass because now she’s pregnant with my child and I will be a good father to that child even if it means putting up with her relentless need for attention. Also I can’t talk to her because she can’t stand when people “judge” her; that’s a “trigger” and therefore off limits, and she claims some abandonment issues to do with her mother. Basically I've tried telling her to leave me alone repeatedly, I've been blunt and I've been diplomatic but it does not go down well (months in the dog box and no change in behavior).

What I’m hoping is that there is some method I can employ

ANY advice would be appreciated otherwise I’m going to be one of those guys who spends every waking hour at the office.

[Update 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/19lwkf/update_i_22f_am_staring_at_my_mostly_packed_stuff/)

Thank you everyone for the help and input you've provided me. I've been at my brother's for almost a week now. I visited and told my dad about my single status. He's simply happy to have me back and gave me the whole ""I knew he was no good from the beginning

There's been a lot of information going on from all different sources, he called me every name in the book. I let him rant and curse. I felt rather numb during the process. I was just tired and it was just something I had to do. I let him rant and them told him that I would not be coming back. 

He asked me why and I basically told him because he doesn't listen to me. He then got angry saying ""Is this really over f*cking clothes?"" (one of the more recent small incidents). I told him if he could only see clothes or dishes and nothing else

After I was able to get a couple of sentences in

I got ANOTHER call from his mother Tuesday also. Apparently

She also called to see how I was doing. She's not a dumb lady, it's no one's business (no disrespect to her, but I don't like sharing those details, especially to parents). She had a bitter divorce with her husband (ex's father), and has an extreme fear that he'll become like the ex-husband. That's why I wasn't more assertive; I could understand where she was coming from.

I don't know what the story is with my ex's social circle

One thing has left be a bit disconcerted. I told him not to contact me anymore,"" but ""you're lucky you left,"" ones. I didn't think he had this kind of side to him. It's been dying down since Wednesday, so hopefully this will taper off. If not, I'll change my phone number.

That's where I'm at. I'm probably going to settle in this area at least for the foreseeable future. I'm starting work again soon since I was able to recoup one of my old jobs. I have been social and not been holed up in my room. It's nice to have a host of old friends since elementary near by. 

I'm rebuilding my foundation

I left this morning, ate dinner, and am now trying to rest.

I ended up leaving a note. I'm paraphrasing, and that it wasn't fair to either of us to keep it going like it was. I ended up leaving all the kitchen ware, except the stuff I bought myself. So, hopefully, there won't be any contention. I only took my clothes and books and the things I bought and it all fit in the car easily enough.

The lease on the apartment expires in 2 months. This month was paid and we paid next month (the last one) at the beginning of our lease. We didn't commit to another apartment even though we were looking. I'm thankful for that. He can find an apartment that he can afford on his own.

I don't know what to say really. I don't think it's hit me fully yet. Or maybe it's because I have so much to do. 

Either way, so he said I could stay with him until I decided what I wanted to do. I already have a room here because my brother and I are close and I've visited for periods of time before. It was nice to feel welcomed and have a space.

My ex-boyfriend probably isn't at the apartment yet. I did get a text, he'll be back in an hour or so from now.

The sadness in me is still very present

I'm scheduling an appointment with the OBGYN soon. I just want to make sure everything is okay down there. I honestly doubt he was unfaithful

I need time to work on myself and to reflect on what happened. I know I still have to deal with my now ex in some fashion. I thought about changing my phone number, and 2). I'll talk to him and let him know it's over. I don't know if I'll answer tonight if he calls. I'd be lying if I said I will or won't.

Some people were mentioning to talk with him for closure, honestly, just want to be left alone. That's why I'm going to talk to him on the phone soonish so he can understand it's over and so it can be done.

I'm thinking of staying for at least a couple of months, and I could model at the nearby colleges here. My brother and other family members are in the area, so I feel safe and loved.

That's where I'm at right now. Even though I feel like utter crap

I'm going to take time to heal, cuddly, pomeranian that is cuddling with me as I type. I feel weird, but relieved. Thanks for helping me out before.

TL;DR: I left

EDIT: I left the phone on silent and went to bed. Was a broken sleep. This morning I woke up to 22 missed calls and about 6 messages (my voicemail was mostly full). The missed calls are mostly him, so I'll call her probably later. I'm going to tell her it wasn't working and that I had to go. She didn't do anything wrong, and I didn't expect her call (maybe in the future, but not so soon). 

I have to add this in regards to finances. I made the income with my jobs. He is funded by his parents.

I've been with my boyfriend for about 3 years now. For the last few months, I feel unappreciated, neglected, taken for granted, and disregarded or trivialized. 

My boyfriend has some great qualities. He's smart

However, but that's one thing. I'll calmly express things I don't want him doing, like not dumping clean clothes in the floor, not leaving dairy products out to rot, how not to ruin my clothes, and so on, but he just keeps doing it. It's cost me money, and aggravation.

This one is sexual

There are many other examples

He's away right now. He's been gone a few days for family things. I've also expressed (this issue for over 2 years now) that I would really like him to at least text me goodnight at night or call. I know people are busy

He hasn't contacted me. And I feel like I've snapped a bit.

Today I cleaned and segregated our things. It didn't start out with any intent, but then i started separating our clothes and stuff. Now I'm staring at a clean place and realize ""it won't take much to finish packing up and go."" I don't own a lot of stuff (he owns much, much, more junk, and I always have to pack and move it because he doesn't like to pack, yeah, another issue).

Logistically, so there's no furniture between us. We each have a tv, so I'd take mine. The only thing that may have some contention is some kitchenware since many of them were gifts to both of us. I was thinking of just taking what I need, like 1/3 of it, and thinking it's fair. 

I'm staring at it and the adrenaline is telling me to go. I'm calculating it in my head on how to leave. I'd simply go to my brother's house. We're close and he's always wanted me to live with him. It'd be a drive

I don't want him to even contact me. I'm almost startled at how much I don't even want to see him. I feel no appeal to him. I'm wondering why the hell I'm here.

Perhaps my mind is made up. Or should I not leave? Should I sleep on it? I could still leave tomorrow before he came home.

Is it wrong to just leave? I feel that I've tried to talk to him, and he hasn't listen. I feel he doesn't deserve me even trying one more time.

So I can wake up, finish up, eat, caffeine up and go. It's a 6.5 hours journey to my brother's. I sent him a text, and he said I'm fine to come by. I have a key. I'm just leaving a note

Him: 30M 
Length of relationship: 2 years

For years, 1 late miscarriage, and 1 extremely early birth where my son passed away just hours after being born. It was heart wrenching. I was married ( to someone else) at the time and the struggle this created led to our divorce. 

We tried IVF and even considered adoption. All to no success. The adoption thing could have happened

The death of our baby really shock both of us. I still can't look at a photo of him. It just hurts too much. 

Then my husband got really depressed about it all, going through a possible early menopause ( hot flashes, hormonal changes). I assumed that my time was up. I wasn't meant to have kids.    

I started to turn my life around and started to date a bit. I even moved to a new state for a new lease on life. I started dating a younger man. 

We used protection

I found out 5 weeks ago and I kept it a secret from him because I had been in that situation so many times that I couldn't take having to tell someone I had a miscarriage again. I figure it is probably going to happen anyway. 12 weeks rolls around and I see my doctor. I am still pregnant. The traditional danger zone is finished so I decide it is time to tell the fiance. 

He was livid

I understand where he is coming and I consider the abortion just like he asks me to. For three days that is all I think about. We discuss it at length. I even talk to a therapist about it. 

Then one day I am sitting in the park by the river and I see these kids on there bikes and all I can think about it that I want a chance. I want a chance to be a parent

He knows about my past fertility issues and all the problems I had. He even knows about the baby that died. He knows I tried so hard for so long. "" Why do you want to put yourself through that again?"" He says. "" Why are you doing this to our relationship?""

I tell him I can't do it. He tells me to choose between him or the kid. I refuse and he leaves. 

I am thinking that I can do this by myself. I have a great job, a wonderful support system, a 401K, health insurance. I have enough money to raise this kid. It won't be easy, but I can do this. I am ready. My parents have been waiting ages for a grandchild ( I am an only child) are ridiculously happy about this. They throw all of their support behind me and tell me that I don't need anyone else. They say I can do. 

I know I could give this baby a wonderful home. I would love him/her like no one has ever loved a child ever. They would be the most wanted baby in the entire world.

He is refusing to tell him parents or family (even though I know they would be thrilled because they have talked about us having kids with hopeful eyes in the future). He says that he will move to another country just to get away from me

I understand where he is coming from

I don't want to hurt the man I love but I can't do this to myself. I can't get an abortion when I know this is my only shot. I just can't. 

Is there anything I can say to him to make this easier for him? Has anyone been in this position?

Notes: I know the risk for me. Although the finance has never discussed it or brought it up. I talked to my doctor. He says the risks are there

Also

And I understand by doing so that I am walking away from my relationship. 

**tl;dr: Had a bad history with pregnancies and not being able to carry. Got pregnant. Now fiance is unsupportive.  I can support the baby only. I know this will end our relationship. How do I deal emotionally?**

To recap: Questions: 

How do I deal emotionally with a break up during pregnancy?
Is there anything I can say to him to make this easier for him? 
Has anyone been in this position?
Any advice from someone is an older single mother?


Any advice would be appreciated. Kind of new to reddit so please forgive any breaking the rules. They aren't intentional. Thank you!

Edit: Found out I was pregnant 5 weeks ago

Edit 2: For the last time

Edit 3: everyone seems to be adding a lot or filling in a lot of details that actually never happened to justify their stance. Stop that. You weren't there. 

To clarify: he was present at all my bc shots. He saw me get the shots every time I went. I didn't not fail in taking my precautions. I did not get pregnant on purpose.

He knew I wanted kids from the start. I told him

I never once said he had do anything for me and I have not/ will not force his hand. 

He keeps contacting me to push abortion at me. I never call him.

I waited 5 weeks to tell him because I assumed I would miscarry yet again and wanted to save myself a little grief. Should I have told him sooner? Yes. Why did I wait? See my pregnancy history. 

The kid is here. Well

The next few days were okay, and greatly increased the flirting.

At this point, but said something to her anyway. This made things worse.

Now, and will stop to ""stretch"" near me. She says inappropriate things, and makes suggestive motions. She finds reasons to walk into the bathroom when I go (one of the doors to the master bathroom does not lock).

 The worst incident was 4 days ago. My girlfriend had gone to uni, and she was just staring at me. Even after I woke up, she stood there for what felt like a long time, then walked out without saying anything. The room smelled very strongly of sex.

I have told my girlfriend repeatedly that I do not feel comfortable around her sister, that's my sister."" It is not at all like her, she has gotten into fights because girls flirted with me at a bar or store. The sister just giggles and says ""you like it."" when I tell her to stop.

 I have considered moving out, but my girlfriend as well. I stayed at my friends house last night, as my girlfriend would not be at the apartment in the morning today.

I told her having to tell them both to stop repeatedly should never have happened. I told her I could leave, or her sister could leave. Her response was that I was over-reacting.

She has a nice personality so I guess that makes up for it"". At this point we were officially dating and my stomach dropped and my face started to burn with anger. 


I waited a few hours to compose myself before confronting him


That incident was the first crack in the relationship and it has really caused a whole slew of problems(as expected). To this day


The real kicker is that over the last year we have gotten into a few really big arguments. I'd say he has said about 5 or 6 times that he thinks I'm ugly during a fight which leads to what seems like endless tears. And it brings us right back to square one. Afterwards he insists he was just trying to upset me as much as possible and didn't mean it etc. etc. But every time he reiterated those words I started to believe him more and more and trusted and respected him less and less. My confidence is not where it should be at all


This newfound self consciousness has caused new problems that I never had in previous relationships. When I catch him checking out a girl, it reaffirmed those negative words that honestly eat me up. With my ex, neither of these things were an issue whatsoever. I saw porn as a normal and healthy thing and even watched it with him. I would never feel comfortable enough to do that with my current boyfriend. When he goes out to bars with his buddies it makes me much more nervous than it should because I'm convinced he will see girls more attractive than me and want them.

He says we should have our first child before we get married because that will be the ultimate test of whether we will make a happy family. (This would occur anytime after I graduate in May.) So

This does not sit well with me. Besides the fact that I don't want to have an experimental child before making a long-term commitment with a man

And besides this disagreement, no foreseeable income other than his, and will be playing the role of homemaker for 4-5 years, until we return to the States. 

If we were to use his plan, with no income that is officially my own. I feel it would be risky for me to invest that amount of time and financial trust in him with little indication of whether he is committed to me. (He is offended that I would not simply trust him to provide for me and our offspring, but then I remind him of said trust when he mentions wanting a prenuptial agreement to protect his inheritance from any future spouse. We both just need to feel protected.)

My worry is this: I think when it is time to leave the country, commitment, etc, he clams up or tells me not to worry about it; so, I've resolved not to speak to him about it again for a long time, since I don't want to nag, or ruin the potential of a romantic proposal that could be just around the corner. But if he doesn't propose before it's time to go

I am simply not comfortable going away with him like this without being married. Or having a child before any of this!

Would that be my cue to break up with him? Or would it be best to make the journey but refuse to have children until I have a job? Or [insert some other suggestion here]?

Thank you for any words of guidance.

**EDIT:** Thanks for all the advice and concern. I wanted to clarify that I'm not considering planning a child with my boyfriend before marriage. It's off the table for me, because he hasn't wanted to plan for it so far. He is being reserved about my protections as a (potential) mother and the less moneyed party, but he is not cruel or idiotic. My main concern here is **how to handle a lack of proposal or marriage when the time comes**. I think a couple people have said it best: I should simply offer a reminder that I won't be moving to a foreign country without the protections of marriage or job. If we cannot see eye to eye, then I suppose that will be that. Luckily, I have a while to enjoy him before that happens.

**EDIT 2:** I'm reading every comment, thanks. I'll be updating when there are changes. :)

TLDR: I want to be married before taking a risk on moving to a foreign country with my partner for years. He wants to have a child first and then get married later if the family unit works out. Nopity nope nope nope!

My evil boss has a kind of henchwoman  - she is a real ass licker and in many ways just as awful to be around. On Friday she took me to one side and started to have a real go at me for everything under the sun. She is not my boss nor my senior but I took each of her criticisms and addressed each e until she ended up apologising to me.... but then she followed this up with “ [Guy who sits next to her] has just told me that he overheard you talking on the phone outside the office. If you do insist on looking or another job

I was flabbergasted. I basically said what I do on my lunch breaks in none of her concern and if my boss has issue he should take it up with me directly because I have no time for passive aggressiveness. I have not handed in my resignation so as far as anyone is concerned I am not leaving.

This weekend sucked.  It got to me really bad. I cried and took my bad mood out on my family and friends... not cool.

On Monday I noticed in my diary that I had an appointment for an electrician to pop around for 10 mins sometime in the morning the end of next week. I emailed by boss asking if I could work from home. I have not requested  this before and many people are allowed to – it’s considered a reasonable request in my office (they even gave me a laptop for this purpose). I was told “To be fair to the company

I came home and had a real heart to heart with my SO. He said he’s happy for me to leave any time I want

On the back on my WFH denial

This morning I was a call from a recruiter. There is a company who lives 90 mins drive away from my home who have been trying to recruit a developer with my skills for 3 months without any success. They found my CV  online and are fizzing with excitement about me.

I have a telephone interview with them tomorrow and if that goes well a face to face a week on Friday (ironically when I’m being made to take annual leave!). There are no other candidates for the role and the job spec reads that it was written just for me!

If we like each other

Not there yet, I’m respected professionally and this will get better!

I had already made an appointment with university health center for tomorrow morning for an exam and another appointment in the afternoon to talk with a counselor.  I’m hoping that by the third appointment Friday I’ll have a better understanding of my choices and what I want to do.  

I stopped by the guy’s place after class today and we talked.  It went much better than I expected. He was super surprised yet happy to see me.  I asked him if we could talk so we went to his room for privacy.  I started by apologizing for sneaking out in the morning.  He assured me that he wasn’t mad and that he regretted not making it more clear that I was welcome to stay.  Hearing this made me happy and helped put me a bit more at ease but I was still dreading telling him.  I got about half way through a sentence about my period being late when my voice started to crack.  I tried to keep talking and repress the tears but I couldn’t hold it in.  I went from somewhat calm and collected to a blubbering mess in two seconds.  I could tell he was freaking out

This one is going to be long as well. 

Had our confrontation. Did not go the way I hoped it would

Let's start from the beginning. I'm walking to our meeting spot. Call her up.

&gt;""Hey I'm almost there.”

&gt;""Oh hi honey. I just woke up. Let's go get some breakfast

&gt;""You kidding? We're not having breakfast.”

&gt;""But I just woke up and I'm hungry and I have nothing at home.""

&gt;“Just meet me for a minute and go have your breakfast.“

&gt;“I just got up. Why don't you come up and meet me at home?” (she lives 5 minutes away) 

&gt;“Fine. I've got no time for bullshit. I know what you're trying to do. I'll be up in a minute.“

Come out of the elevator. She startles me by standing right there. Tiniest shorts. Sheer top. Full hair and makeup. Obviously didn't just wake up. 

I come in and sit down. I kind of want closure so I'm somewhat glad we're about to have a long chat. 

&gt;“Well

&gt;(long pause) 

&gt;“I just want to say... Darling... That I've realized over the past few days... (world's longest pause) that I want to be with you. And nobody else. Let's forget this and have a nice happy future together?“

&gt;“What kind of future can we have when our past is full of shit!”

Should have said something about a throne of lies

Some highlights. Pretty much word for word.

&gt;“But you cheated on me!”

&gt;“I never cheated on you! How can you say that!”

&gt;“Because you lied to me about being with other guys!”

&gt;“It wouldn't happen if we were together! It's only when you leave me by myself and I don't want to upset you...”

&gt;“That's not true. Just three weeks ago we were together. I saw you off and sincerely wanted you to have a great time. You promised to keep in touch and tell me everything

&gt;“But we weren't together then.”

&gt;“We weren't together?”

&gt;“By together I mean living in the same house, I just don't know how I felt. I just want to be yours and nobody else's. I want your attention, but when you leave and deprive me of it...”

&gt;“That's not true either. Just last month I told you I'd be flying in on the 2nd. You asked me to come in on the 6th instead so, but you specifically pushed me away and chose someone else’s.”

&gt;(pause) 

&gt;“Don't you have something to say?”

&gt;“I'm thinking it over.”

&gt;“Want to think it over out loud?”

&gt;(2 minutes of silence) 

&gt;“Well?”

&gt;“I'm still analyzing it.”

&gt;(another long pause

-snip-

&gt;“Listen. You've also constantly left me alone and made me wonder about who you were with. I forgave all that. Why can't you forgive me this little white lie and believe me when I say nothing happened? 

&gt;“Because I know something happened.”

&gt;“How do you know? What do you think happened?”

&gt;“Well let's just start at the very beginning. Just as we were getting serious you were sleeping over at the other guy's house every other night alternating with me.”

&gt;“What are you talking about! I never slept over at his house. I've never even been to his house. We've only slept together once and then we just hung out as friends.”

&gt;“You were never at his house? Then how come there were all those pictures of you at his house on you secret flash drive?”

&gt;“Well

&gt;“Then why was there a topless pictures of you sprawled on his bed?”

&gt;“But

&gt;""What the hell is sex in my sense of the world? What the fuck? A blow job? What?”

&gt;“It was... Why are you doing this

-snip-

&gt;“All right so what happened in Paris just now for your birthday?”

&gt;“Nothing happened! He's just a friend.”

&gt;“No sex in my sense of the word?”

&gt;“No!”

&gt;“No romantic walks?”

&gt;“Well...”

&gt;“No kissing?”

&gt;(deer in headlights) 

&gt;“So you kissed him?”

&gt;“But I didn't enjoy it! Just made me realize I wanted you. If only you came to Paris like I asked you to...”

-snip-

&gt;“All right. Look at it this way. Say we call up your best friend Natalie and she sits down on that chair right there. The one who keeps telling you to dump me because I'm not good enough for you and I'm never around when you need me?”

&gt;“Why? You want to call her? She'd tell you you're overreacting...”

&gt;“Really? If I told her all of your lies about men, why the fuck are you still with that person? Not only that. You'd probably lose her as a friend right then and there.” 

&gt;(This is what finally gets her to break down hard. She loses it and bawls her eyes out.) 

-snip-

After the conversation begins to go full circle a third time

She jumps up

&gt;“Don't leave!”

&gt;“Why not? You have nothing I want

&gt;“... Don't you love me?”

&gt;“What does that have to do with anything ? This is not about love. I don't trust you one bit.”

&gt;(crying)”But why baby

&gt;“You spent three and a half years lying to me

&gt;“I'm telling the truth now!”

&gt;“No you're not.  It's not just that you're still lying to me

&gt;“But...  Don't leave? Sweetheart?”

&gt;“Can you just let me pass? Please?”

I open the door. She doesn't move. I say”Good bye"" and walk away. 

Feels good

**tl;dr** Have a long talk with a habitual liar. She admits to some cheating

So a few months ago my wife has a revelation. She's 30 and I'm 35. We've been married 5 years


We aren't even particularly social people


A week ago she told me that time is running out. She wants to start now. We have some savings but nowhere near enough to consider this. She believes that oil consumption is killing the planet, but she will not consider buying replacements when the time comes.


I'm a software engineer, I consider myself quite ecologically aware.


I don't know how to balance everything out. I feel like my wife will look down on me if I buy new computers or a new phone and will probably be very unhappy if I decide to fly anywhere for work... Clearly vacations are out of the question. I love my wife and respect her views but I don't know how to proceed without ending my marriage.

TL;DR Wife has revelation, any advice other than 'leave her'.

Hey everyone, but wasn't sure the right way to express myself and some of y'all helped me with that and I appreciate it. Some of y'all had some hilarious comments so thanks for that too.

Last night she came over and I immediately took her upstairs to my room to talked to her.  I sat right next to her and held her hand and I said I needed to talk to her because I've had something on my mind all day. I feel like I can tell her anything and before I say anything else

**""The idea of getting you a specific gift made me feel as if I was
buying your love and affection. I want to feel as if you love me
because of who I am
this behavior

**I think communication is a healthier form to resolve problems.**

**I don't have a problem giving you gifts. It just hurts my feelings
that you are demanding a present to buy your forgiveness for something I think isn't that big of a deal in the first place. To me that means your love can be bought and its conditional and that hurts.**

**Gifts are only gifts when they are given

**I dont want you to interpret my unwillingness to buy you stuff as an
indication that I'm not invested either. I love you so much, as should you now.**

**You are setting the stage for me to give you things
when I upset you in the future - even if it's over nothing. And I refuse to be in a relationship like this. I do not approve of materialism or any form of buying forgiveness when we have an argument. We work it out by talking.**

**I hope you can take this as a learning experience and grow from this. I'm not your father and I'm not going to spoil you. You need to know that right now if you want this relationship to continue. Ok

To my surprise, and I said, no your weren't, be honest, if I didn't get you something and not had this talk you would have gotten upset. She agreed and said that since I put it that way she thinks she was acting stupid and immature. 

So we worked it out, I was really expecting you to get angry and leave or at least complain or something"" to which she replied ""That would be very shallow of me, I'm not throwing this away over a stupid gift, I love you way more than that any gift you could give me and I'm sorry for putting you in that situation to begin with""

I personally believe her. But I will certainly watch out for this behavior in the future. If it happens, like groceries, cooks me dinner and we switch off buying dinners when we eat out (as it should be) That is also a reason I believe her. Because she doesn't ever act that way, until now. Also, I let about alot of the email that was very sweet from her, and she said she cried reading it because it meant so much to her etc. I just showed the part where she mentioned the present. All in all though, I have a pretty good understand how a healthy relationship should be and I've been very ""alpha"" in this relationship, but I do love her and I hope it works out.

Thanks for all your messages. I know this is screwed up

When I confronted her a couple nights ago, but I could tell she was being stubborn and trying to justify it.

She let me talk to him on the phone finally. Right away I knew he sounded off mentally. He told me he got his heart broken recently by someone who cheated on him, and then he said calmly that his life is already ruined. He didn't give a shit. I seriously wanted to fight him and I felt he enjoyed having that power. 

So then there was a big argument. Her father was furious about the whole thing and was just screaming at her. He was saying some mean stuff calling her an idiot, it's just for innocent fun, it'll make the boy's year, he was suicidal, blah blah,"" and her father kept saying over my dead body, this is real life not make believe, she should be focusing on her career etc…. 

I didn't know what to do so I was starting to plan on how I would break up with her. But then the next day she contacts me and tells me the entire thing is dropped. She said it's not going to happen and it was stupid and she was never serious about it, but she didn't want it to come between her and me. She said she was being selfish and got tunnel vision. 

Today I proposed to her. I love her too much to dump her. She is a 9.5 and I'm only a 7, she is more than just a body). I told her it was on the condition we will have a long engagement and I'm disturbed about this whole situation that happened and that if she didn't come to me with this news today I would've ended the relationship. She told me to just forget it ever happened, and then to prove it to me, she took the friend off her facebook list in front of me and said she won't even talk to him again. 

TLDR: Either the guy relayed to her I was planning to propose

EDIT: I see you're all perfect and don't know what TRUE LOVE is. You all think she is a cheater but she is not. She just has a really big heart. She goes out of her way to help people, but I told her that's not acceptable to me and she's going to send it back to him with a letter explaining why she won'to continue contact with him. 

Lastly, but her looking great is a sign of the beauty of what's inside her. Everyone wants to be around her and be in her life. It is really hard to deal with that as her BF, always has been. So many times people drunk dial her or obsess about her with tons of phone calls, she still hasn't learned to be able to say NO though and she told me she will work on it, but in 8 years she has never been unfaithful. I want to give her the best wedding now to prove to her I'm worth it, you guys might be right that she was testing me somehow. I do feel hurt and I don't completely understand it, but it isn't enough to dump somebody for just being naive or for wanting to get married.

I have been married for 14 years, we enjoy each other’s company and we love each other.  However, I love her more than anything.  So how do you make something that is hurdle in a relationship and make it worse?  You cheat.

On two occasions, while travelling on business I utilized a high class escort service in order to try and fill a hole I had in my heart and in my relationship.  There is no excuse for what I did.  I took a legitimate issue I had with my marriage, and handled it the absolute worst way.  Other than these two indiscretions, I have never been unfaithful in our 18 years together.  After both occasions, I felt terrible, guilty, and that I had betrayed my wife (which I had).  After the second time I did it – I thought about what had happened, resolved myself that it would never happen again.  Dealing with incompatible sex drives is easier than the guilt of cheating if you really love the person.  Meanwhile my guilt was extreme.  I wanted more than anything to tell my wife what had happened as I have never kept a secret from her and believes she deserves the truth.  The only reason I have not told her up to this point is that I know how badly it would hurt her.  Here is someone I love more than anything in the world and I have done something that will hurt her and puts her at risk.  That is something I have been thinking about continuously since the I cheated.

Last week, I believe it probably is.  In both times I cheated, protection was used, but there are no guarantees.  I immediately saw a urologist and ran a full panel of labs.  I get the results today.  There is a very good chance that this evening I am going to tell my wife of 14 years that I was unfaithful and furthermore have infected her with an STD.  At this point, I don’t give a shit about my own fears or feelings, my only care is that I am about to hurt someone I love.  

I am not posting this because I want pity, don’t do it.  It does not fix your problem and can only cause hurt while putting a loved one at risk because of your indiscretion.  I know I am not the only guy out there that is frustrated with sex in the marriage, what I did is not the way to fix it.  It will not fix your frustration, it will not make your marriage better and make your issues go away.  If you care about the person, it will only make you feel guilty, make you feel like a liar, and put you in a position where you have the option of living your life as a cheating asshole, work the problem out

I get the results this afternoon.  Whatever they are


Edit:  The tests all came back clean.  I am still going to tell her.  I’ve read most of the posts in here.  I hear what some of you are saying about not telling her.  I actually thought about this for some time

One last thing, I am reporting from the front, don’t do it.  It doesn’t solve anything, it doesn’t fix anything, the issues are still there and now more complex.  Not to mention you are putting that person in harm’s way without them even knowing.  If you care about the person you are having issues with, try anything else, or consider ending the relationship.  At best

He was angry and hurt, I never once stopped to think about how he may be feeling about his wife being so unhappy. My unhappiness has caused him great unhappiness as well.

We have never fought(as in yelling and screaming) but we have had some serious arguements(always with respect) and he said that because I told him about it before I did anything stupid, which to me, is totally understandable. This completely re-affirmed why I married him and how much I love the man with everything that I am. He promises to be a better partner and father, and he has vowed to find a job within the next two weeks, even if it's something dead end and minimum wage.

I told the other man that I didn't want to continue a friendship or anything else with him. He told me that he has been feeling guilty as well, but he is no longer my concern.

I wrote this post because I was so stuck in my head about all of this. Putting it out there for scrutiny and advice has helped me put everything into perspective and helped me make a very good decision. I am giving him a few weeks to prove to me that he is willing to really work on things, but I will do what I have to do to remain emotionally healthy.

Until now. 

Last month, but the last time I talked to this dude, I was in a Poly relationship at 22. I'm sure he assumed I was either still with the guy or in an open relationship. 

None of our texting was flirty until I asked if he got any new tattoos. Well, hiding his pictures, keeping my phone on silent while I'm home, and other super shady dumb things. 

He old me our mutual friend (female) still lived in the same town as he does and that I should ""go visit her"". This pretty much means he wanted me to come to him without directly crossing any lines. I fell for it. I call up my friend, and get once click away from booking the tickets (CC # entered and everything) and it hits me: This is WRONG. It is dead WRONG. I picked a weekend that I knew my BF had to work. I would have to lie to him. I was lying to myself. I wasn't going to visit an old friend, I was going to fuck some dude I had zero feelings for. 

Now

I texted him to tell him that I was monogamous, and that we shouldn't talk. He understood completely. I removed him from FB and deleted his number. 

I am in shock from all this. It escalated so quickly from ""OMG I MISS YOU BEST BRO BUDDY"" to ""I want to feel your skin on mine"". Ugh. UGH! 

The whole thing disgusts me. If the tables were turned

What do I do? Am I a total shit head? Is there hope? Should I tell my boyfriend? Should I break up with him?

We had an angry pseudo-breakup conversation about how to proceed when she moves back to a town about 3 hours away from me. The conversation and the ensuing thinking period showed me a few things very clearly:

1. I don't really want the relationship anymore
2. She is much more invested in me than I in her. The thought of breaking up sent her into an unhealthy panic attack.
3. I'm not very committed when it comes to breaking up

So my questions are this: how do I properly end it when 3 days ago we came to a shaky agreement to just see how we felt going forward? How do I keep her from going into a tailspin of sorts? And how do I resist the common attempts to negotiate?

I was diagnosed with a testicular tumour that may be cancerous (it was) right as the conflict with my wife's mother peaked. The day I needed my testicle removed, I was in too much pain. She got more upset and began to shout that I was kicking her out. I told her I just needed rest. The nurses came in after she left and comforted me. That night I texted her mother, as she doesn't answer my calls. I told her she had to leave.

She moved out and locked the doors and took the keys. It took a while to get in, I gave her all the love I could. My mind was on cancer admittedly, but I know I was there for her.

Since then, what was said. Since then, my cancer has been discovered to have spread to my lymph nodes. I am to start a 4 round course of chemo, starting with a 6 night stay.

Since my testicle was removed, I get angry. I know my hormones are unbalanced and my wife knows this too. The stress of all of this is hard on us, but she occasionally takes things out on me. I get upset, then I get angry.

When I get angry
I tell her I need space, to go away. She will stand and shout or bang on the door I'm on the other side of. It's too much for me to bear.

Recently, my rage. She thought I would be better off moving closer to the hospital and hire a carer. When I was finished chemo, in three months, and had time to heal, we could be together again. She would bring our child to visit.

I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I need my family, but I never imagined that she would not be by my side during chemo.

I was so upset. I started shouting, I told her my body is dying. I can feel the tumour in my lower back, I can feel it grow. I need you, I need my family. I can't do this without you.

She pulled her hand away and I carried on pleading. She yelled that I was hurting her. I didn't know what she meant and realised she was really pulling on her hand and I was clutching desperately onto it. She said I was being violent and it was proof she can't let our child around me. I ran into a room and slammed the door

I can't do this without her. I am fighting choriocarcinoma which doesn't have the usual stellar 5 year survival rate expected from testicular cancer. I know my anger is caused by hormones and triggered by shouting. There's so much stress in my life and it's really peaking. I have support from my friends but without my wife and child in the same home as me

I do not want to leave her

**tl;dr**: Wife and I have been together four years, gets evicted by me. Wife accepts this, but finds it hard. I then get diagnosed with aggressive testicular cancer, need one ball removed and then four rounds of intense chemo. My hormones are imbalanced, I become less patient and more prone to anger, but only when anger is directed to me. Wife wants me to move out for my entire course of chemotherapy, three months. I can't do this without her support. I need to know how I can convince her to stay.

[Original link here](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/11a0ri/best_friend_23_f_got_too_drunk_and_tried_to_sleep/)

This morning when she woke up she was immediately sick. I brought some tea to the loo for her, and I was honest. I told her No, but that she tried. She asked me why I didn't go for it and I said it was because she was too drunk and I didn't know if that was what she really wanted. 

She thanked me for it, which didn't provide much opportunity to talk. End of the day when we got back from the pub, but neither she nor I drank. We didn't get a quiet moment from everyone else until later at night, getting munchies in the kitchen.

I decided to bring it up again, and I told her that no matter how turned on I was or how much I adored her, I would never take advantage of her, and that our friendship was more important than a night of drunk sex. We started talking about our relationship, what exactly we were. We got to a point in the conversation where I simply said that she was beautiful, intelligent, kind

We both leaned in and kissed. It was a great fucking kiss. Like a hauntingly great kiss. But it didn't go very far, and told me she'd see me up there. 

This is where I fuck up: My mate came in too and he and his wife started pretty brutally fighting. They're at the point that they're getting a divorce. My mate was in pretty bad shape so I calmed him down and talked to him for a while.  I mean, really long while. Like when I finally got up to bed, she was already asleep. I poked at her a little to wake her up, but this girl is a super heavy sleeper. When she is out, she's out.

So, she's going to avoid talking about it on the train, so I won't be able to talk to her until we get home. Hopefully I'll manage some sort of game plan on the train as to what the fuck to say to her or do.

Last week I went over to his place to get tickets to an arena football game.  I didn't mean to snoop but he put them on the cabinet in the dining room and I accidentally kicked a chair over on my way to it.  It broke and collapsed against the sideboard and the door swung wide open.  Inside the cabinet was a stack of VHS tapes and cassettes.  Every one had a name written on it.  Women's names.

I assume I found his private conquest stash but didn't have the guts to put in any of the tapes.  I grabbed the tickets

That night

Not ""Did my chair break, point blank, ""Did you break my chair?""

I told him I did.  He didn't seem to angry.  The night went on as planned.

Ever since, he won't kiss me on the lips.  He knows I found them, I'm sure of it.  He smells like other women now and I'm sure I'm not just being paranoid. 

I sat him down and asked him yesterday if he was cheating on me.  He started to laugh -- incredulous at first, and I had no idea how to react.  I just left.  He called me to apologize but I hung up on him.

We've been together 2 years.  Those videos were seriously in the hundreds.  Several of them was labeled with a date within the last 6 months.  How could I have not seen this happening?

**tldr: suspect I found SO's ""conquests"" on VHS tapes in his house in the hundreds.  He refuses to talk about it.  Should I leave or bother with a fact check?**

edit: he just called me and left me the creepiest five minute message I have ever listened to.  He talked a lot to himself in the background and he was breathing *really* shallow and heavy.  He sounded frustrated and kind of angry.  He said he'd ""be right over"" and I texted him telling him not to bother since I'm not even home.  I'm getting more creeped out.

Hi everybody

I'm making an update because I've gotten a few very heartfelt messages from people asking me what I decided to do

First, I hadn't slept, eaten, showered, or left the house, because I have a bad anxiety disorder and this entire process has been EXTREMELY stressful for me. All I was thinking when I made the thread was ""god, I don't want to break up with him, I don't think I can make it through a single day without him.""

I'm just hoping you can understand my mindset here

So, outside of the DD community who advised doing so. After reading through a lot of the discouraging/angry responses on the thread, I told my best friend about the proposal and she just stopped short of threatening to call the police.

A lot of responses in the thread I made were EXTREMELY helpful in arriving at this decision. I believe my personality and character are inherently incompatible with this kind of relationship, I would rather be alone and miserable than miserable because I'm in a relationship with someone I love that's so far from what I want. Someone kind on the thread suggested thinking of it as though Ezra had died, because the Ezra I know has. I won't take it that far, but this is basically what I'm thinking. I'm mourning the loss of the relationship I thought I could have, because it turns out I can't have it no matter what choice I make.

I spoke to Ezra yesterday and told him that I decided not to consent to a DD relationship with him. His response was, I responded that I had taken all the time I needed. However, I was highly emotional in this conversation (crying the entire time) which made it difficult to really articulate to him that I was 100% serious and was giving him an ultimatum. This conversation ended with the agreement that I could have more time to decide, and with him reasserting that DD is a dealbreaker for him in any relationship (not just with me, but in general), although he was very comforting and spent a lot of time telling me that he still loves me and wants to marry me one day.

I feel like he basically steamrolled me last night and refused to listen to any of my reasoning. I believe he did this because it probably LOOKED like I was reacting out of emotion rather than reason. He was able to accuse me of being irrational and rash even though I know, I'm willing to help him through his anger, and I'm willing to serve him occasionally, but I'm not willing to let him spank me or give him total control of the decisions I make.

I actually doubt this compromise will mean much to him, but if it's not possible to do so and be happy, I'll take short-term pain over long-term pain. I'll be extremely depressed if he breaks up with me, but I won't be miserable forever or lose my sense of identity. If he breaks up with me, I can handle that pain. If our entire relationship changes to one where I'm being controlled constantly, I don't know if that pain is manageable.

**tl;dr: I'm not agreeing to a domestic discipline relationship with my partner

EDIT: I'm so amazed and overwhelmed by the massive amount of support in this thread. I haven't replied to everyone who wrote, I'll come back here and read the kind comments from all of you. This is really an amazing place and I can honestly say that you've stopped me from making a huge mistake. I haven't given the letter to Ezra yet, but I'm going to do so tomorrow and will provide an update when I know what direction we're going in.

**LESSONS LEARNED**
1. I never knew that abortion was such a big deal and potentially so invasive and traumatic and even life threatening. I thought, pro-choice meant easy choice to abort.
2. Birth control is not a woman's responsibility, too. Condoms NO MATTER WHAT.
3. Be honest with your partner and don't punish someone for being honest.

1341410608.0,w14vs,Girlfriend passed away in a car crash yesterday. Advice about funeral and family?,saladsixshooter,473,105,156,"Hello reddit

Background: I'm a 21 yo male

Yesterday morning she was killed in a car crash driving home from my college town to her town. I haven't seen her or her family yet

First off, but what I want more than anything is to kiss her on her forehead (whatever's intact) and say goodbye. I know if I don't do this I will regret it, but I don't know how to ask her family about it. I'm not super close to her parents and my girlfriend had issues with her mom for a long time, so I feel a little strange asking for such a personal request.

Secondly, and we'd always say the chorus line to each other before we hung up the phone at night, ""baby I'll be dreamin of you."" The first time I cried after I heard the news was when that song came to my head, and I sang it and I reached that line. I play guitar and sing decently, and I wanted to play that song at the service (slightly modified, slower and some changed lyrics), but I have aboslutely NO idea if this is okay or if this is even ever done. I've never heard of it being done, or have you been to a funeral where this was done? Is it awkward? And again

Finally, and my gf had three younger siblings, including a 14-year-old sister who pretty much idolized her. I've already offered my help if they need it, but I feel like I could be doing more to help, and I don't know how to handle my relationship with her family after the funeral. Advice please?

Thanks for reading

**Tl:dr;** My girlfriend died in a car accident, and need advice on how to handle her family.

**EDIT:** Wow, but know that I've read all your posts at least twice, and you've all been so incredibly supportive and helpful. Thank you so much for the condolences, and the advice, and the perspective. I've spoken once with her family and am going back tonight to deliver some photos that they requested of us both and of her and her friends. I've decided not to play the song; I identify with all of you who say that it may seem too presumptuous of me to do so, and also I've been rehearsing it on my own and I simply can't bring myself to sing it without choking up. I've decided instead to courteously ask her family if I can buy her a ring to wear; her birthday is in a month and I was going to give her a promise ring, she knew and was very excited about it and if at all possible I'd like her to go to sleep wearing it. Obviously I'll defer to their decision

I'm blessed to know that she did not suffer disfiguring injury in the crash, and my request to see her again before she sleeps is moot. Thank you for your advice on this, and my heart goes out to everyone who shared those gut-wrenching stories of relatives and loved ones whose bodies were irreparably damaged. Thank you so much for sharing. Just to clarify, I have seen and dealt with a fair amount of gore with respect to people I've cared about, and for me not seeing her one last time was simply not an option if it could be done. But to all the people who advised me to preserve my memory of her, I understand and I thank you.

I just want to let you know how much all your responses mean to me, for your experience. And to all those who have said that they can't imagine dealing with something like this: never idolize your woman, or man. But if you find the one that you really identify with, who gets you completely, who's sweet and caring - never let a week or even a day go by without reminding them how much you care. I count myself as so lucky that I was able to say goodbye to her in her final hours, even though it was an ""I'll see you in a couple days"" goodbye. If they're worth it, then by god make sure they know it every day.

I love all of you,False,,t5_2qjvn,1341531106.0,,,t3_w14vs
1375381420.0,1jidew,"My[26m] girlfriend [26F] has been lying and cheating on me with multiple men for at least a month, most likely more",Caught_Her_Cheating,485,112,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jidew/my26m_girlfriend_26f_has_been_lying_and_cheating/

We have been very open with each other and share pretty much everything (or so I thought). We've both been cheated on in the past and I've made it explicitly clear that I don't want to be with anyone who could do that to someone and that I would never put myself in a position where that would occur because I know what it feels like and don't want to put anyone else through that hell.

After about four months into this relationship she told me she loved me and that she's never felt this way about anyone before. That she has been hurt bad in the past and had never intended to find someone like me or even get into another relationship again because she was so jaded from the past. I didn't say it back right away because I won't say something that meaningful unless I actually mean it. It took me a few more weeks to tell her I love her but after realizing how happy I was with her and how happy we seemed to make each other I knew that is what love is about; pure happiness. I may be wrong about that but to me

She has always had a lot of male 'friends' and early on we each talked about our past which ended up sharing some similarities as well. We've both been with a lot of people (sexually) so I have never felt any feelings of jealousy or contempt for her as that would not only be hypocritical of me but also an unstable foundation to build a relationship upon. She just claimed that she gets along better with guys than girls and has been somewhat of a tomboy since she was a child; not a problem

Even though everything seemed like it was going fantastically and that we were falling in love there were occasional 'red flags' that would pop up in my head or give me a bad gut feeling. I chose to ignore those at my own peril because I thought they were just my own insecurities creeping out and did not want to let a personal issue like that negatively affect our relationship. 

A few examples of the red flags

* In the five months we've been together she has told me about no fewer than 10 male 'friends' of hers that have miraculously come out of the woodwork and contacted her after years of not hearing from them
* There were minor inconsistencies with her stories of past times or descriptions of these friends and their prior relationships
* When we were around her family I noticed that they tend to watch her rather carefully, or what happened last night or last weekend, etc...)
* She talks a lot and tends to divulge more information than necessary on a lot of topics and would go to great lengths to ensure me that some of these men from her past were interested in her but she did not share that feeling

Her family has shown me nothing but kindness and welcomed me into their home as one of their own since I first met them. I genuinely enjoy them as they all seem like good people who want the best for their daughter. I have a great relationship with her father and he's even taken me aside a few times to ask me how things are going and if there's anything that seems of or that I don't like (a few minor things have come up but I spoke with her about them well before telling her father). If anything has come up in those side conversations he has spoken to her alone for the benefit of our relationship and he seems to really want us to succeed.

We've only had one fight since being together and it occurred a few weeks ago when she asked me if I would be uncomfortable with her going on an 3 day long fishing trip with a few of her friends from fire school (she wanted to be a firefighter but was unable to due to medical reasons). I told her the truth that yes


Earlier this week while we were at her house cooking dinner she asked me to go up to her room and get a movie queued up on her computer for us to watch. While waiting for the website to load I decided to check my email. I loaded gmail then went back to the movie site to pick something out. When I switched back to the gmail tab I saw her inbox pop up and went to log her out but noticed that there were a few emails toward the top that caught my attention and severely worried me. At this point I know that I should have logged her out and not done anything more about it as what I was doing was very wrong and a violation of her trust. I sat there for a few minutes looking at the subject lines of the top few emails and had an internal debate with myself as to what I should do. Unfortunately my integrity was momentarily suspended by what felt like a wrecking ball hitting me in the stomach and I had to know more.

Once again

The three offending emails that caught my eye were as follows:

* A flight confirmation (going out of state) purchased and forwarded to her by a guy (one of the ""friends she hasn't seen in years"") for a weekend trip that was bought the day before her flight which happened to be the day that I left for a weekend mountain biking trip with two friends.

* An email from another male ""friend"" she told me about where they discussed plans for her to fly out to see him sometime in August.  Further down in the email chain she had sent him a few screenshots of potential flights in the coming weeks asking which one was best

* A craigslist confirmation email for a ""missed connection"" post she created earlier that day seeking what she described as a tall extremely hot guy she saw during her lunch break that day.


At this point I was crushed. I had no idea what feelings were going on inside me or how to handle them and I broke down crying for a moment. This was the girl who told me she loved me (I reciprocated because I do love her) on a daily basis and consistently reminded me how happy I made her. We shared the same bed together and talked about potential future plans as I'm sure most young couples do; but this time I thought it was genuinely real. 

I logged out of her email as I was afraid of what else I might find if I looked any further. After gathering myself I went down to the kitchen to help finish the meal so we could enjoy our 'dinner and a movie' night. It took everything in me to keep it together the rest of the night


It's been a few days now and I still haven't confronted her about it as I'm not quite sure how. I haven't been eating very much and my stomach has been in knots. This is so painful and at this point I don't know what caused me to do the following.

Using my memory of that craigslist ad I stupidly searched for it and replied the two days later. To drive the knife of infidelity even deeper she included the fact that she was single and was hoping that this guy was too in the posting description.

After sending my reply including a few details about a tattoo and pretending to be this tall

For the past 24 hours she's been texting who she thinks is this other guy (but is really me and a google voice number) and after three times of me asking if she's sure that she's single or doesn't have any recent ex boyfriends I need to worry about she has explicitly stated in no uncertain terms that she is in fact single and has been for a while. 

We've texted about many things; what we each do, lying, and even cheating/being cheated on. We both agreed that it sucks. She's told this fabricated persona that she's been cheated on and would never do that because of how much it hurts (sound familiar?) but that she really wants to meet him for drinks and maybe more.

Last night she told him she knew of an amazing, stating that a woman from work was looking for a good sushi spot in the city and she wanted to know the name of the place I took her to on our first real date. Seeing that text pop up on my phone felt like getting hit by a dump truck. 

Last night she made plans to meet him for dinner at that sushi place in the city. Earlier today I asked her if she had plans for saturday night because a few friends from my tough mudder team were getting together for beers and s/o's were welcome. She declined saying that she promised her parents she would go to their house and cook them dinner that night.

I cannot continue in this relationship and have firmly made the decision that I will be ending things within the next 48 hours

The two options I am currently considering are:

1. Just breakup with her and say that things aren't working out between us and that we should see other people

2. Uphold the dinner plans she has with this 'guy' and then show up to the restaurant with a print out of the texts shes been sending and the craigslist ad to confront her about the lying and cheating. I also plan on telling her how I found the ad (that I saw her email

I don't know what to do /r/relationships. I'm obviously in a bad situation and will be breaking things off soon but am looking for advice on how to proceed

Thank you.


**tl;dr**: Accidentally opened my gf's email and saw three very recent incriminating emails including past flight confirmation to meet with another guy in a different state, please help.



**Update**: Thank you all so much for the advice

She doesn't deserve the satisfaction of knowing why and it's blatantly obvious that she does NOT care about me so I've already mentally and emotionally checked out of this 'relationship.' While confronting her at the restaurant in any one of the manners suggested below would make me feel like a boss I don't think it's worth it. She will be shocked, so what? I cheated on you because of..."" 

Not having the closure of this relationship will drive her crazy. She will think everything is going great, look for something, even look for the tiniest shred of evidence that will justify her actions and provide that reason as to why; but I'm not going to give that to her because she deserves nothing.

In due time

Fortunately enough we do not live together but merely sleep at one another's house a few times each week. One thing that will make this a bit tricky is that I have a female roommate who my ex has hung out with and considers a friend; well maybe more of an acquaintance as they've only hung out one time without me being present. Either way, or why I severed all contact with the liar because even something as simple as a text saying ""he thought you were cheating"" or anything like that would give her an ounce of closure; something she doesn't deserve. 

And now what you've all been waiting for

* I'm going to cancel our dinner plans for tonight (as the boyfriend) and tell her that I won't be home until late tonight
* I will tell all of my roommates that she is no longer welcome in our home and that if she shows up she is not to be let inside.
* Every phone call and text will be ignored. I will NOT communicate to her in any way
* As the craigslist guy I will not contact her with the exception of a text tomorrow to confirm the date but I will not show up to confront her (as the bf) or provide any reason for standing her up. 
* All of her belongings currently at my house will be placed in a box outside as she will certainly show up at my house after a day or two of no contact and seeing a box with her things in it will confirm that she is nothing to me anymore.
* Her family was always kind to me and I'd like to thank them but will not as this will undoubtedly provide some information to them which will be relayed to her. The kindness of a word of thanks to her family is not worth the chance that she may have a bit of closure
* I will schedule an appointment with my doctors office immediately for a full battery of STI testing
* I will look at this as a learning experience and will lead an amazingly happy life and enjoy everything I do because I can

I know a number of you prefer that I not pursue the above method and that I should just serve up a nice steaming hot cup of justice to this shrewd harpy and for that, it would not matter. Doing this to her will be a momentary blip on her radar and someone of her moral character, or lack thereof, will get over it quickly and will continue their ways regardless of being caught.

In the interest of providing some evidence to everyone I've taken screenshots of the craigslist ad, and text messages between the two over the past week. **[The Evidence](http://imgur.com/a/JEewl)**


**Edit 2** After I stand her up tomorrow (as the other) and cut all ties (as her boyfriend) I predict that she will continue to text/call over the next few days. She will most likely contact my roommate and the only other mutual friend we have in hopes of seeking information about what happened, and what is going on. Within minutes of standing her up I will begin to execute the plans listed above and also talk to our mutual friend (who she met through me) and my roommate to tell them that things are over between us and kindly ask them not to provide any information to her about me. I need to be careful with how much information I reveal to these two loose ends as do not know how capable they are of keeping quiet.

I will provide a follow up to this within the next few days

**Update**

There was a slight deviation from the initial plan and a special thanks is in order to /u/Spam-Monkey for the suggestion. As the guy she had a date with I kept texting her while she waited at the restaurant saying that I hit traffic, etc...and kept her there for 2.5 hours before she finally gave up and left; she must have really wanted to go on a date with him.

She has been texting and calling throughout the morning but I have not responded to anything. She's had a few of her friends try to contact me and she contact one of my friends and my roommate trying to get an idea of what's going on but I've been leaving details out so no one really knows exactly what's going on yet. Earlier this evening she figured out that I've been intentionally ignoring her and sent a text acknowledging the end of our 'relationship.' 

Without giving her any clues as to why things ended like this I think the mindfuck was successful. She has no idea what happened and doesn't deserve to have the closure she's looking for. Thank you all for the kind words of encouragement

I wish you all the best and hope you're able to find happiness wherever you look.

Cheers!

Things had been going OK... and then he got a part on a TV show a month ago. I was thrilled! I had helped him get the part and he was so happy. But that was when our troubles seemed to start over again. He now has no time for me; and he feels that I put pressure on him to see him. I do; I miss him after 2+ days. We live in the same city and it can be so hard to not see him. I have no family

The fame seems to be sort of going to his head. It is all he talks about, and then immediately go back to talking about what is happening in his. It is becoming tiring, it is starting to ruin my self-esteem, like nothing I can do can match up. When I was employed and he wasn't I didn't spend hours upon hours talking about my job, I tried my best to engage him in his life, I feel it is no longer reciprocated. 

Last night, not being able to perform the next day. And he started to get viciously angry at me, and started yelling at me at 1am. He would be incredibly cruel, then stop and apologize, then go back to being cruel, then apologize, then start on an even crueler tirrade again. The entire time I merely cried and apolgoized; he was angry because of the pressure I have been putting on him. At one point he threw a pillow directly at my head very hard; I did not see it coming

The whole time, no one recognises him on the street). He told me multiple times that I am now further down his priority list and I need to understand that. When he was being cruel he would blame me for all of the bad things in his life, then when we was apologetic he would blame himself. I never once got angry, I was so broken and tired. He finally stopped at about 3am. He told me that he ""can't do it anymore"" and ""I need to change"". I had been doing my best to change; I give so much and support him so much. And I have a big fault, and that is I want to receive some attention from him each day, but I am trying to get better, I am trying.  

I am just so tired. I thought that when his life got on track that he would be happy. But he has never thrown anything at me before. It was just a pillow but it was thrown very hard

I wanted to get the technical details of his life now out of the way before the actual meat of the disscussion and I wanted his story before I told him I intended to inquire into offical documents.

He arrived at my apartment, there'd be no hanging out. Afterwards he would go home. He'd prepared himself. He was well dressed, shaved and button up shirt. like a job interview almost. I had butterflies in my stomach, nervousness I can't remember feelings.

We spoke for a very long time


**Sex Offender Registration;**

He lives ""almost entirely free of supervision"". After initialy being released from prision his freedom was quite restricted, and advising him if he moves or goes on a vacation, etc. He's allowed in bars now (he wasn't for some time). He is ""registered"", but says the lists don't work the way the public think they do, that they're a tool for the police.

""In the last seven and a half years I have had no none-positive interactions with the authorities. I've lived entirely within the bounds set for him

**Jobs;**

This is a problem in his life. He works as an accountant

""I would not have this job if not for preferential treatment from my father, skill, experiance, and ability, but it doesn't matter. I get interviews, nail them, and get rejected after a criminal record check because ""we're looking for someone with a wider skillset"". This is unlikely to change in the near future.""

**Kids;**

After I brought up children

""I am not

I asked if he wanted children

""I always wanted a family. I wanted to be a husband and a father. Accepting that these dreams are unlikely and perhaps unwise because of my mistakes has been very difficult.""

 **The Event Itself;**

 **This is the part everyone's been waiting for.**

It was long, feelings, and thoughts. In the past, when I've told this story in detail I've been accused of trying to make excuses and rationales. This is not the case, I know that I was wrong. But I think that details are important to understanding what happened.""

I'm going to be a big tease and say that I don't think I can repeat the story he gave and do it justice. Fear not, albeit emotion light version.

* He was at party with friends

* The party dispersed

* He took her home

* He took her to his apartment.

* That night he forced himself on her. It wasn't violent, ""and I was aware of that fact"".

* He ""felt immediate and terrible guilt"".

* The next morning he took care of her

* It was a week later that she decided to take to the police. He went to police with her

* This is the reason he was given such a light sentence (less then a year).

""It is unlikely I'd have been convicted of anything without a confession""


**Victim**

He'd known her for years and it was very close platonic friendship. I asked if I could speak to her and he spoke with anger for the first time ""NO. Absolutely not."" 

He went on to explain that this is why he needed to stress from the beginning this was his own fault, had begun to believe that he'd been taken advantage of, and that it was his victim being a ""vindictive sex regretting slut"". He allowed her to continue that train of thought ""because it felt nice to have someone believe I was never a monster."" But then his ex contacted his victim and tried to get her to apologise. ""When I found out I was almost more humiliated then when I told my parents initially. I broke up her with immediately. Please just allow [victim] to live her life.""



**Therapy/Rehabilitation

He's been seeing therapists since prison

**Access to official documents**

He was suprised and I think insulted when I brought this up


**TL;DR** It was 2am and I was about to renege on my rules and offer to let him stay (on the couch) when he got up and left himself. I told him he was allowed to contact me,False,,t5_2qjvn,False,,,t3_16ifvs

The only request he made was that I use the inheritance to help put my oldest brother's son (who is 10 years old) through college if he chooses to go.

Basically, who are 16 and 14.  

So here's my problem.  If I don't give some of the money to my brothers

Oh

What would you do?  Give them some of the money in hopes of repairing the relationship

Thank you for reading my post!!

**tl;dr:  dad died and left everything to me and nothing to my two my two brothers and it's straining our relationship.**


edit:  Hi, it may be helpful to give some background info.  

I'm 28

My middle brother is 38 (I'll call him Bob).  He's had a lot of money problems because he had a side business in real estate before the housing crash.  To add to his problems

My oldest brother is 41 (I'll call him John) and he has been in and out of jail for drugs and burglary since he was 18.  He's also done about four or five stints in rehab to no availe.  He is currently on Methadone maintenance therapy.  I highly suspect that he is still on drugs of some sort.  He lives hand to mouth.

Dad was 66 when he died.  He was functioning alcoholic since before any of us were born.  I won't go so far as to say that he was outright abusive

My whole family dynamic has been really fucked up for as long as I can remember

The crux of the problem is that Bob and John gradually froze Dad out of their lives over a period of years because of an accumulation of real / perceived grievances.  Bob was borrowing money from Dad to stave off financial ruin (it happened anyway), Dad utterly HATED Bob's wife for his own real / perceived greivances (I keep writing real / perceived because I all I hear are rumors long after the fact).  

John's situation is a little more complex.  John and Dad came to blows when John was 18 and was forced to move out.  John's life since then has been a downward spiral of poverty and drugs and he blames all of it on real / perceived abuse he took because of Dad. The straw that broke the camel's back came when Bob and John got into an argument with Dad in Dad's front yard and Bob pushed him down.  As they were leaving, you deserve everything that you get.""  Bob took out a restraining order on Dad for some reason, and it was still in effect when Dad died.

Was Dad right to cut them out?  Did Bob and John suffer due to abuse they took years ago?  I don't know.  Dad could be a real asshole, he's fried all of his brain cells with all of the drugs he's taken.  He really unpredictlable and has an explosive temper which is why I try to avoid him.  John's situation is the reason dad wanted me to provide John's son with enough money to go to college.

It should also be pointed out that we all grew up in a modest, and have been taking out loans to pay for school).

I'll end by saying that even though I'm not really close to them

I told her to get the f out or I would drive her to the middle of Indiana(next state over) and throw her out there.  She climbed over the roof of the cab and down the windshield and over the hood so I went back inside and told the bartender to call the cops.  The  bartender toldd her she had 5 seconds to leave or the cops would be called.  She left.  I then went to another bar that's really close to my house as I was getting tipsy and she showed up there too.  She said she didn't know I was there and left.

I'll start off by saying that last night was rough.  In my last post, I wanted to kick his door down.

I ended up falling asleep on the couch after bawling my eyes out and woke up this morning to no texts from him.  He did not text me at all that night.  Not even a ""Good night"" text which he *always* does.  So I texted him and asked him how his night went and he said ""It was fun.""  He didn't offer up any details

Apparently, they went out back and had a bonfire and drank.  I asked him how studying went and he said they didn't study much because she said the test wasn't going to be very hard.  So I quizzed him some more and asked if he got drunk and he said, ""A little bit but not that bad.""  Then I said, ""Well, what time did she leave?""  He said, ""I think 1 or 2 AM.""

I honestly don't know what to think.  He acted like this entire situation was no big deal at all.  I told him that it made me uncomfortable and that I found it shady that he was hanging out with another girl alone at his house.  That's when he said she was just a friend and that it's no different than when I hang out with guys.  He said he trusts me

He also informed me that his female friend invited him to her birthday party on Saturday at her place.  He agreed to go because he said she really wants him there.  Ugh!  I can't win.  He thinks this whole thing's innocent and cool.  Well

So that's the update.  I'll guess we'll see what the future holds.

1373589322.0,1i4ct1,I [20F] have forbid my BFs[22M] family to be in our sons life.. I feel I am making the right decision but would appreciate an outside perspective,hismomisacunt,471,108,197,"I know that it sounds harsh of me from the title.. but hear me out. I feel I am completely right in my decision but this is something my boyfriend and I have been arguing about constantly and I admit that I am ridiculously stubborn at times. I just want some honest opinions to see if I should go on with this decision or give them yet another chance. I apologize in advance for the long story. 

To make it a little easier this is a list of his family's ""names"" and ages:
Kelly [48] / Dave [50] / My boyfriend
When I refer to ""the favorites"" that includes Mike


After about 6 months of being in a long distance relationship with Jack I moved in with my grandparents that lived in the same city as Jack to be closer to him and to also experience something new after living in the same small town I grew up in. He had recently moved back in with his parents while looking for a new apartment and so I was going to be meeting his family. He had told me about how his parents play favorites and that he wasn't one of them. I thought that Jack must just be insecure. What parents play favorites with their kids? And if they do

Kelly and Dave are extreme sociopaths. They are blatant about which children they care for more and see no problem with how it affects their other kids. Just so you have a little idea on just how unable to care for anyone other than themselves and the favorites, and ""the kitten scratched too much"". They didn't even try to re-home them. His parents would just take them to a shelter. I have no idea how the shelter didn't start asking questions or refusing but I'm getting side-tracked.

The day I went to meet his family I picked out my favorite outfit, I stopped him and asked if he was going to introduce me to his family and he reluctantly tried. His parents ignored us. They didn't even acknowledge that we were in the room. I was standing awkwardly right in front of them trying to tell them my name and neither of them even lifted their heads from what they were doing. I was appalled. They would occasionally say something to one of the favorites but they refused to even grunt a hello to me. Eventually while I didn't agree with it, I accepted that this was the normal treatment towards Jack and Danny and tried not to get too hurt over it. I couldn't imagine how Jack must feel having his own parents treat him that way, when I was stranger and felt like I was going to burst into tears.

After a year of dating, I knew that now they would be in my life forever and that I needed to try and move past that. Unfortunately their seemingly nice behavior didn't last long. 

When I was about 2 months along Jack and I got an apartment together so we only had to see his family a few times a week when they invited us over for dinner. Suddenly Mike, how they will lock my baby in a closet when he's born, and many other foul things. This all happened in front of their parents and his dad would often egg on the behavior and join in. When I told his parents my intended due date, they decide to book a cruise the week of my due date for their whole family... They would rather be on a cruise than meet their grandchild.  It got to the point that I would only go to their home on rare occurrences and the whole drive there I would be on the verge of a panic attack over what they were going to say to me next. Jack is nice to a fault and even though I kept telling him how much their words hurt me he tried to convince me that they were just joking. 

Jump to about 7 months along and we are having a family dinner with his family. Danny kept calling me a fat slut and I was doing the best I could to ignore it until I snapped. I lashed out at him bringing up his recent arrest after he was caught stealing for the 5th time, and were now defending it. I had done nothing to deserve this treatment and I had put up with it for months. I told them that if this was the way they were going to act then they will never be meeting my son, because I'm not going to subject him to that kind of behavior and I stormed out. 

Kelly then started texting Jack almost daily about how selfish and self-centered I was. She tried to convince him to leave me and said that she would help him sue me for custody of our child and that she could raise my son. Oh yes, some apology. I told Jack that was bullshit and that I wasn't going to accept something so fake. I finally got tired of fighting with him about it and just let it go for awhile. 

About 2 weeks before I was due, ""I'm sorry for the way I treated you"" ""I'm sorry I let my sons harass you for months"".. but that was too much for them to handle. Like always, his parents were trying to buy their way out of the situation. Something they have made a habit of now. For Jack's sake, I started trying to tolerate them... cue situation worsening.

After I was home from the hospital and his parents were back from their cruise I reluctantly allowed them to come to our apartment to meet my son. Kelly immediately started criticizing me for formula feeding him.. I have tubular breasts. --May be a little uncomfortable to male readers now-- I produced a minimal amount of breast milk for 2 days before it stopped altogether. I tried to explain this to Kelly but because she has a degree in nursing she thinks that gives her the right to force her opinion on me. She told me that I hadn't tried hard enough and that I allowed my milk flow to stop. I was infuriated. I had cried over the fact that I couldn't breastfeed and have that bonding experience with my baby. It made me feel like less of a woman knowing that not only were my boobs horrid looking but that I couldn't even feed my son. I tried until my nipples were raw and bled but that was not trying hard enough in her mind. After that I told Jack that until his family's behavior starts to improve they would only be able to come over once a month. I couldn't handle the stress of a newborn baby and a panic attack every time his family wanted to drop in. Jack agreed because by this point he was also disgusted with this family and had been around my family enough to finally realize that normal parents don't act the way his do. 

Kelly then started guilt-tripping Jack. She paid off his $10, and a variety of other gifts. Kelly constantly texted him about how they have done so much for me and they are hurt that I don't appreciate it. Uh, I never asked for the gifts. I never asked for the money. All I asked for was to be treated civilly and they couldn't do that. They would rather try and buy me off. Like I mentioned before, Jack is nice to a fault. This was also the first time that he was getting any sort of attention from his parents and everything they did he turned a blind eye to so that he wouldn't jeopardize that attention. After Jack begged and pleaded with me, I agreed to see his family for a few hours. We went to their home, Danny started in with the insults again and I ignored them all. I didn't talk very much at all, but I was proud of my behavior. I had nothing nice to say, I didn't say anything rude at all. I just stared at my hands and tried to make it through the visit.

When we left Kelly started texting Jack about how I had been such a bitch, but we will still be your son's family. I actually feel sorry for your son. Hopefully you will grow up and get over yourself one day. Best of luck"". I also received a text from Chris saying ""Everyone is trying to be mature and trying to get along with you but maybe you're the one that needs to learn to forgive people and accept our family. We don't want to push you away but everything we say you ignore and keep holding grudges. You're acting like the grinch. Really immature and hating everyone for something that one person said like 5 months ago"". I immediately just started crying. I was so hurt and just exhausted with the whole situation. I had never done anything to any of them. I have never deserved the way that they treat me yet they constantly go out of their way to make me feel horrible. I told Jack that this was the final straw and that they will never be in our son's life and we have been fighting over the issue ever since then. Kelly is still texting him about how horrid I am and recently made up some story about how I was using Jack's phone when he was sleeping to send Kelly rude texts then deleting them from his phone so that he wouldn't know about it. Jack went online and saw that there were no texts sent from his phone when she claims I sent them. When he caught her lie and called her on it did she apologize? No, but a new pair of shoes arrived at our house for Jack the next day. 

So even after the way his brother's and father have treated me, and I believe all ties should be severed unless by some miracle they turn into decent human beings.

Also his wife does not know whats going on

Im going to keep this short cuase im still a fucking wreck right now.
**TL;DR at bottom**

Me and my fiance(both 24 engaged for 1 year) have been together for 7 years
We have our random fights but nothing ever big. Ive been living with her since we started dating. She is the most perfect thing i have ever seen.

I had my fiances old cracked iphone thats just been sitting around the house for a few months, but it said ""sorry i couldnt give you my pussy last night, my legs were all stubbly"" and i was like that is weird as fuck to say to her 12 year old sister. that was the only message in there so obviously she deleted some before it. but must of missed that one.

So i recoved all of her deleted SMS to that number( which is surprisingly easy) and came across 2 years of the most graphic dirty talk i have ever read. and how they meet up and how good the sex was and for her to send more pics of her pussy to him.
There were certain times where she would respond to my text and tell me she loves me and literally seconds after tell him she wants his cock in her. Mine and her sex was always pretty good. at least i thought

this destroyed me

Anyways i wait for her to come home to ask her about it. I was shaking like crazy

She tried denying it after i asked her who the number was. then showed her the text and she admitted it was a co worker that shes worked with for 5 years.

Hes 35 and has a wife and a kid on the way....me and her are both 24.
She told me its been going on for close to 4 years and fucking him for 3.

Thing is he has a wife and a kid on the way. Ive never been so hurt in my life, the only things in my life i care about, I have no friends because we moved closer to her family, and i dont have much of a family

I feel like his wife deserves to know
I cant believe a human could lie for so long and have no guilt about this. Or at the very least just break up with me before she continued to do this. And i feel like they will continue to fuck unless i let his wife know

I feel like this guy should lose everything hes loves just like i did.
I really want to tell his wife but i just want to see what other people would do

**TL;DR- found out my fiance of 7 years has been cheating on me for at least 3 years with a married man who has a kid on the way

Not sure what to do, no porn, just me and my thoughts.. I'm clearly not going to divorce her, but am at a wits end. She's made mention that it's because of my weight, which is ironic because she knew how much I weighed when we started dating and I've actually lost weight since then.

We ended up talking, ""This is something I need, and something I both want us to experience. We have no intimacy and that's not ok"". So we talked about it over dinner, after dinner and a lot of things came to light. While she didn't go into everything, (but will as we have more talks), she did state that she did have a bad experience in the past with her most recent ex. Also she stated it wasn't my weight that was keeping us from having sex but rather the angles that we had tried. 

We tried a few different angles and they all were hurting her, just straight up sex. It was the best sex in my life, I saw a side of my wife that turned me on even more and I feel like a damn champ after hearing, ""you have the most perfect cock"".

There are still some issues that we've got to talk about. One being why she had pain with a lot of positions


What can I really say, wasn't going to happen and for everyone who read and replied. Thanks. While I didn't follow any one particular advice, all of your posts made me think about a lot of different things and it has seemed to re-awake my marriage and re-kindled my wife's and I passion for each other.


**TLDR**  Wife and I talked


**Update 2: So over 200 comments... holy shit.** I've got a good idea of what I need to do. And sorry, I'll be back tomorrow for some kind of update. I've messaged some of you, and just wanted to say thanks. Out of the 200 comments, some actually helped.

No need to post anymore, and were legit, I thank you. Really gave me a lot to think about and go with.

**Update: Wow**... never expected to get so many replies. So the consensus seems to be

  * 1) divorce her  
  * 2) I'm obese and should have expected it. Become Healthy
  * 3) Do therapy and it won't work
  * 4) She's just not interested in sex
  * 5) Medical issue preventing sex

1365140412.0,1bpttx,Update: I'm (24f) about to take custody of a friend's (30f) three kids while she enters rehab.,marshmallowsbunny,422,79,84,"Okay

I (24f) took the kids (10f

The kids are good for the most part. The youngest now has the habit of calling me mom every now and then. I'm hoping it's because my actual name that they call me by starts with M. He has had nightmares for two weeks and ends up sleeping in bed with me. This stopped but after seeing his mom over Easter it's come back. I'm hoping he doesn't wake up tonight.

The oldest girl has been snippy with me a few times, and was very vague to the other parents... Over all they are doing better than I expected. They all have /are visiting a therapist. The middle boy has been more emotional lately and has cried about minor things. I'm a little worried about him because he always puts up a happy strong front better than the others. Their schedule is consistent. They are eating, getting homework done, seeing friends. It's been okay. They really like that I take a good half hour tucking them in like burritos and talking to them before bed.

As for me... I'm tired all the time. I didn't know what I was getting into but I don't regret it. Only had one melt down to my boyfriend that may or may not have involved tears. I have not seen my friends

The last thing I would note is that suddenly all my guy friends are popping up and willing to 'help me'. A few have offered to take us to dinner, but honestly it's upsetting. It's like they want to play house or something. Like they are trying to charm the kids or do a good deed and save me. I feel like they see the kids as cute little puppies or accessories... They don't have to deal with the laundry, nightmares, and checking homework... It's just surprising to me. I keep telling myself they are just trying to help, but it rubs me the wrong way so I keep refusing... If anyone could explain it to me that would be nice.

So yeah

TL;DR: I took the kids! They are doing pretty well

Edit: I can't believe this blew up so much. Thank you all for your kind words and advice. I'm reading all of it. Thank you to whoever got me the gold as well.

As for my male friends

The fact is the kids are going through a difficult time and I am being over protective. The youngest is painfully shy and needs to meet a new person two or three times before he will talk. I do not want to stress him out with new people if it will only be a one time thing. If my friends (male or female) what to help and interact with the kids then they must be willing to be around for more then just one day. If they can't then maybe they can go to the grocery store or stop by for an hour or so. Nothing too stressful for the little one at this time in his life.",,t5_2qjvn,1365178406.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1bpttx/update_im_24f_about_to_take_custody_of_a_friends/

**Back story:** My dad had a son from a previous marriage before marrying my mom and having me. My big brother lived with his mother in another city

**Getting to the point:** Almost a year ago

This entire time

The trial for my brother was held in another city yesterday and I was unable to attend

My mom texted me this morning telling me that they found my brother guilty. Not only did the court find him guilty

**What the fuck do I do now?:** My heart is broken. How could my big brother who I've always looked up to do something like this....... to his own son? And my nephew, man. He's going to have to deal with this shit for the rest of his life!

I'm so angry. I feel hate and rage and sadness and loss. I love my brother

How do I ever face my brother again? Do I act like he doesn't exist? I can't fathom forgiving him. He was supposed to be in my wedding..... Hes supposed to be the big brother he always was! I hate him. I'm scared for him. You know what they do to child molesters in jail.

I know I'll need to continue to be a great aunt to my nephew

My parents are in a world of grief. My Father having to see the pain in the eyes of his son and grandson...it physically hurts.


TLDR: My brother is a fucking monster

How does a family get past something as horrible as this?

I'm not excessively overweight, nor am I deformed/disfigured. I'd rate myself about a 6. I have one or two hobbies, but I haven't been successful in finding groups with people around my age.

 First of all, vitamins, special diets etc. Recently, like the last 6 months, she has been watching more and more YouTube videos on massages based on lymph, chest, legs mostly from that Psychytruth channel

 Then she started to watch more of Jaiya

 Since then she has been experimenting on me with what she calls ""holistic sexual massages."" At first I thought I was the luckiest guy in the world. She would take her time discovering my body and bring me to climax like I never had experienced before.  As awesome as it was for me on my end

 This is where it gets a little creepy for me.  For one of her sexual massages she would save my cum and masturbate with it. Sexy right? But now she has been saving my cum for when I'm not around to continue her experiments. She said she has used it in cooking

 Should I be concerned about where this could lead? Or should I let her continue with her explorations and just support her? Here are my concerns:
1. I don't want our sex life to be publicly talked about
2. I now have to masturbate into a cup so she can save my sperm
3. She is going more and more down the road of ""new age"" beliefs and I don't believe in some of the stuff she is talking about.

1337188757.0,tq7qk,"Married for 8 years, never had sex, but pleased him",rejectedandguilty,438,126, and only after living on my own for 9 months have I found the courage to share my story anonymously. My story is a long one
 
When I was 18, emotionally abusive family and friends. So I decided that I would fall in love with him no matter what and make him love me in return. He was very calm about me and almost never tried to hide it. We moved in together almost immediately, although both of us were living abroad, so moving in was not something massive: I only had to move my suitcase in with him. He almost stopped French-kissing me 2 weeks after we started dating. I tried to ask him about it, but he would always say that he liked kisses on the cheek much more. So it was. I was very attracted to him and was very excited to have sex with him in the first weeks we were together, but after the first attempt failed, he explained me that he was too big to fit in a condom and that this condom experience traumatized him immensely, but then he came up with new excuses: what if the pills were not reliable enough and what if I got pregnant. Again
 
During that time, otherwise it hurts them a lot. So I needed to give him hand jobs. I was a virgin and it was very easy for him to make me believe all those fantastic stories. He, however, would never touch me in return. In fact, he would never even look at me. He humiliated me for wanting to have sex with him, for wanting being naked and for wanting to touch him even. He said I was a ‘bad girl’ and that I was into ‘naughty things’. At some point he played it so well that I almost had to beg him to give him a hand job. And all that time from the first week we dated I cooked, cleaned and washed for him, so I was even proud of how honest and highly-moralized my man was.
 
He was never excited about getting married with me, he agreed to marry, saying that it would be the only chance for me to get residential visas in his home-country. The fact that he, by marrying me, could get visas and work permits to the EU could never be part of the narrative; I tried to say that it benefited us both, but he always was cool about it and ‘never needed it’, although he has of course used it extensively afterwards. However, no festivities and no guests. On our first night, turned around on the bed and fell asleep. He never attempted having sex with me ever since, when I have been told so before
 
Needless to say, in the course of 8 years - he would come up with new excuses every time: sometimes there were other people staying in the same house (!) with us and they would hear me ‘screaming’, sometimes it was the fear of pregnancy although I was on the pill all the time. Sometimes it was just that I was too pushy for it and that this was a turn-off for him. My whole body hurt from the pain of being close to the man I loved madly and selflessly, from giving him sexual pleasure and from being completely and utterly rejected. Every time after a hand job I needed to run to fetch some napkins. He would never touch me and he made me believe that I was disgusting, dirty and unclean. And oh, I believed that! I tried to talk to him about the sexual problems millions of times and every time he would tell me to stop pushing him, he would say that he was working on solving the problems and that we shouldn’t talk about it at all. He would push me when I tried to kiss him
 
I also did ALL of the house work, great food, superb desserts. I wanted to give him the best. He, however, cooked for me only once when I was in bed with severe fever and vomiting and he cooked me a cup of instant soup. He would quit jobs after doing them for a week, claiming that the jobs/environments/people there were unbearable and that they were destroying for his personality. So, his parents and I had to take care of the finances, so he quit a job where he worked for a month after being unemployed for 1, which made him rank school’s first and got him into several Master’s and PhD programs, because ‘I was helping him as spouses are supposed to help each other’ and ‘I was doing it for myself as much as I was doing it for him because it was for our family’s common good’. And every time he would tell me that either the assignment was crap or that my English was insufficient. Each of the papers I wrote for him got top marks; I did even better with his papers than with my own.
 
The reason why it all lasted for so long and why I never suspected anything was that he would always victimize himself, including his mistakes (sometimes I did it on my knees) and he would strictly forbid me talking to anyone including my parents about it. He even tried to forbid me seeing some of my friends, who would ‘contaminate me with feminist ideas’. I had to cut contact with all of my male friends. And the worst thing was that he made it in such a nice and sacrificing way that I believed that a really loving couple should not spend time with their friends, and should only seek each other in this world. That lovers just want to spend all of their time together and should not waste it with other people. So, I was deeply ashamed when I spent time – especially when it was fun – with other people. I was shamed and blamed for everything, and I believed myself to be a deadly sinner who would rot in hell; a person who should spend her whole life on charitable activities to save the people I love from the ‘spill-overs’ of my sins.
 
We’ve been together for 8 years. 8 years of sexual humiliation, too, when we would eat the dinners that I cooked for us, or when we watched movies at home. I was a very happy person and I was a very cheerful one, because every time I complained about something, he made me feel as a traitor and as a selfish, ungrateful tart. When I finally gathered strength to tell my story to my best friend, because I was sure I did everything wrong in this relationship. I was sure that everything was my fault and that I was never able to help my loved one and support him in the way he needed it.
 
I tried to break up, he says that he has never realized that good relationship, signs of love and sex were somehow important for me. And he openly says that I was very good at showing him that I loved him immensely, that he never thought that I could eventually leave him and that he just had fun pushing the limits to see how far I could go.
 
The worst thing is that I feel deep guilt and sorrow for him. I developed a feeling that he was my child and that there was only me in the whole world to take care of him, that I am a sinner and a wicked creature and that I need to stop wanting being happy, that I need to stop my life, return to him and continue taking care of him for the rest of my life. I can’t even realize whether he has actually done anything to me or whether I’m just complaining about something entirely normal. My perception of truth is so wretched that I don’t understand what is normal and what is outside the framework of normality. Even when I am writing right now, I am afraid that I present my story too single-sided and too subjectively. Generally, I feel like a traitor for talking to people about it. I don’t know what to do and how to live on with that. I would love to hear what you think about my story. Thank you for taking your time to read it.

**edit 1:** Thank you so much everyone for reading my story! I never expected anyone to actually care. I was afraid that even my friends would turn their backs to me, I feel guilty and as the one to blame. I guess that's the dynamics of an abusive relationship (even now, after seeing 73/73 comments supporting me, I considered if writing 'abusive' was too judgmental). Sadly, I'm not a troll; if only it were a fruit of my imagination, yet it's 1/3 of my life. It really is helpful to hear the opinions of people who have no stake in the situation and who have a clear outsider perspective. Thanks again everyone for taking your time, I really appreciate what you are saying.

UPDATE #2: it's 5:30 AM and I just found out the guy has been cheating on me with one of his clients... I'm guessing he's been lying to me about it for several months now. I'm moving out this week, you saved me tonight :) 


UPDATE:

So things didn't go so well. 

He got home and immediately started yelling at me

I walk out of the room to ease the tension. I get back and ask where my new pack of gum is. He said he took it and brought it to work because he ""felt like it."" I knew then it was going to be a weird night. 

He was uncharacteristcally rude to me. He just kept saying over and over that I don't own him, I don't pay for anything (that REALLY got under my skin), and I'm a self centered bitch who is just mad because I can't afford a Maserati. 

But what hurt the most was when he got on this high fucking horse, and I just don't need you in my life anymore."" He notices I start tearing up and he calls me a child and told me to come back to him when I stop crying because he ""only likes to talk to adults."" 

I leave the house and go sit in my car to get away and clear my head. I come back and he's still an asshole... Basically knit picking every single mistake I ever made in the relationship and saying how he doesn't forgive me for anything (basically for having guy friends) and he's going to start ""doing him"" and told me he really doesn't care about what I think. 

When I asked about the car

So, that his head is getting too big for him to be a respectable person, I don't appreciate being called names or being hurt on purpose. I said ""fuck you"" and walked out of the room. It felt good, I can't lie. 

So I'm here, if you've ever been in a relationship that lasted years, I'm not so sure I'm ready for this long road ahead of me without him, tbh. Any advice on coping with that is appreciated. 

Thanks again to everyone for their input. It hurts now but I'm sure in the long run I will be better off. :(

[28M &amp; 27F],Betrayal28,425,85,388,"Married two years come next month and we have been together for 5 years. One daughter, work, but stressful and long distance with the wife and baby. We needed the money so I took the position. 

At first the distance was bearable, and we were just not close. She wouldn't have sex with me, which was hurtful and we were fighting a lot. I thought something was up and ended up finding some messages between her and another guy. I confronted her and told her I understood (because I did) and that we both had to work harder on us. That I knew the distance was tough but I was doing it for us and so that we could be better. She admitted that she had been too friendly but swore nothing else happened. We made up and started to talk about our future more, and about buying a house and when I left again I felt good about things. 

Once I left, I started to feel more suspicious because of the messages and I hacked into her accounts. I know I'm supposed to say I felt guilty, but I didn't. 

What became clear was that she was fucking another guy and was very, and I saw her becoming closer and closer with this guy. Emailing him several times a day, telling her she loved him, and then finally some pictures with him, her, and our baby. Which was probably the final straw. I asked one of my close friends to go by our house on his way to work and back to just see if anything was up, and he told me he saw a truck in the driveway of the house we are renting

I'm due to come home at the end of this month and want to be smart and careful when I go back. I really feel like her actions are divorce worthy. It is a betrayal in every single sense and it makes my heart weak. I cannot believe someone would do this to me. Especially since our relationship has never gone through things like this... she is a normal

The only positive in all of this is that my work is going really, but seeing as home doesn't have much for me this fresh start option is becoming very, very attractive. I really think its probably the best move for me... let my wife be with this guy and get a divorce. Its not a great situation for my daughter, but I just think I'd be marginalized moving forward anyways. I don't know. I do feel like our situation is beyond marriage counseling or anything like that. I confronted her and she lied to me and kept up her affair... and even jumped in further. She has chose the other person in every sense over me, and it fucking hurts.

Thanks everyone for the positive advice and support. I decided not to worry about it and just enjoy my time with this woman. 

We went on our third date and she was asked for ID yet again - I used that as a way to bring up my own age. She asked if the age difference bothered me, so nothing about our mutual attraction seemed out of place.

Since then we've seen each other at least twice a week, scary smart and very sensual. I feel like when she's focused on me I'm the most important person on the planet. She reaches out to put her hand on my arm or to touch my cheek, subtle, but always making it obvious we're together. She's interested in my work, my actual work, and not just how much money and ""stuff"" comes with what I do. That's refreshing. 

My only real issue now (and it's a great one to have) is slowing myself down. She was very upfront that she takes sexual relationships pretty seriously so she's slow to crawl into bed with a partner

I just have to remind myself we have plenty of time!

It's been a circus in some ways, so I apologize if I didn't respond to all of them.

I have to say, so much that I asked them to stop. I don't want to be blamed as leading their behavior and it's only going to cause me more crap. Some of his friends have stopped talked to him and I'm the one who got blamed for it.

It appears my ex tried to stretch the truth a bit, but I really, really, don't care to know.

And as I say that, so I felt a bit obligated. It looks like my ex was either unfaithful, is rebounding, or is just plain insane. He is moving in with another woman when the lease is up and they are someway involved. She was an acquaintance and I didn't really think anything of her. Supposedly it's all over facebook, so much that even his mom figured it out. I basically told her good luck (politely) and ended the conversation. She hasn't called me since then. I don't know what her motivation was there.

My ex is also still trying to contact me. I am not getting cursed as much. It's mostly me getting blamed for ruining his social life and him curious about what I've been up to. I blocked his number, I have not responded to him.

I can actually commute from my brother's home, I think I'll get a cat. It's a bit in the future, but it's something I am looking forward too. 

On the romantic side: I have no intentions of being in a LTR anytime soon, so I'm trying to get some confidence in myself.

We became empty nesters several years ago. Last fall she took a job working for someone who was a friend of ours.

During the time she worked for him, but it made her happy and I felt it was innocent, since he was gay.

Turns out he isn't gay - I caught her having sex with him February 7.

Over the next week she continued to contact him secretly while she said she was trying to work out things with me. I finally said I needed to see her Facebook

Looking at her Facebook, mirroring the negative things they were saying about the men in their lives.

She claims she said those things to fit in. To be liked.

She had done similar things a few other times in our marriage. Each time she had gotten together with a group of women who were upset with their partners and said terrible

Looking at her Facebook and text messages

I love her, fidelity and partnership. I am 50. This is the only life I have. I can't wait another 10 years to ""see"" if she will be true to me.

I don't feel I can talk to family or friends about this because it will permanently taint her in their eyes. No one has any idea what is really going on.

I am coming to reddit mostly to help me think through the process. She is away for the weekend at one of our son's houses

Here are questions I have:

Am I being naive to think she will be loyal and faithful now when she hasn't been in the past?

How do I determine the best path for my own life going forward?

I went over to her place and explained what my deal was. At first, she began to understand and tried to comfort me. It went from ""What did you want to talk about?"" to ""I'm sorry I accused you of using me for sex."" She tried really hard to assure me that she's not attracted to standard issue fratbros.

To be honest, I'd like to believe I smoothed things out, and I told her that if she was still mad at me, I'd understand.

I realize I'm hosed....trust me.  I just don't know what to do at all to recover from this.  

The co-worker is a woman that works for me.  She's contract and has been there about 3 months.  She's attractive, a project, then her and it just happened.  My wife was inconsolable.  I talked to her at length and she does believe me now when I tell her I have not cheated with this woman. I offered up everything....access to my phone, text, logs, email, everything and she knows that I'm not missing any time that can't be accounted for but I can't convince her that I'm not sexually interested in this woman.  

The sticky part is this:  her contract is up and we have the option to hire her. She's a good worker and there is no question that I want to hire her. It's not fair to her to let her go through NO fault of her own but my wife is convinced if we continue working so closely together, have sex like rabbits, etc. so I don't want to do anything to mess this up.

So what now?  My wife hasn't made any demands but this just happened two nights ago so she's still digesting it.  I can't punish the woman for my mistake but if my wife lays down an ultimatum should I tell her to deal with it (in the most understanding way possible) or start searching for a new job?",,t5_2qjvn,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1c2n9b/i_called_my_wife_by_my_coworkers_name_during_sex/

Then all I did was tell him that I want to be with someone who wants to spend time with me. He said that he does want to spend time with me, etc. I told him that it made me question his committment, it made me question his intentions and his fidelity, and it made me wonder if he was embarrassed of me. 


He first tried to say that he felt awkward when I was around

Finally, I didn't care. I told him I was going to stay at my mother's for the night. He also didn't care about that. I've been here for a 2 nights now and he calls me begging me to come back/for another chance. Although it was tempting (I do care about the guy. I am attached to him and the idea of starting all over fresh is scary) I did what I knew I had to do. I stuck to my guns, even if it means having to live with my parents for awhile. 

I told him that as soon as I was off the lease I'm going to change my phone number.


The end! I am free of this horrible relationship and although I feel like I'm in limbo I know that it's for the best, and a year from now I can look back and be proud of myself.

So I just first wanted to thank each and everyone of you for providing opinions and insight. I read every single one and took it to heart. This is what I love about reddit

*****************************************************

**Now to the update:**

Before meeting FIL I discussed with the wife again her feelings about the situation. She re-iterated that she would still like for me to take the lead on the situation and just told me to let him down gently. She assured me that it wasn't going to create any resentments and wouldn't be upset. 

I ended meeting FIL to discuss things over a beer. After exchanging some pleasantries and talking about the hockey game that night we got to brass tacks.

**Here is a paraphrased version of what I said:**

*Your daughter and I spoke about what you asked of us and ultimately she left the decision with me.*

*First of

*The day I put that engagement ring on your daughter's hand was the day she and our future marriage became my highest priority above anyone or anything. Right now as newlyweds we are trying to build a life and a foundation for a loving and healthy marriage.*

*Right now

Then I briefly outlined a plan where we could help him with getting his business site up and cover costs like business cards. I also offered to help him with the job and apartment hunt. Finally I said that we could offer limited financial support where ever we could afford it. I said I was sorry and felt terrible that this is how it had to happen.

He actually took the news quite well. Told me not to feel bad and that he'd figure it out, our relatives and just our lives in general.

I called the wife to update her on the situation. She seemed a bit stunned/numb on the phone when I told her what happened. She didn't really know what to say when I asked her how she felt about it. When I got home she seemed fine but I know that she's probably feeling a bit guilty about the whole thing. Won't press the issue until she's ready to talk about it again — possibly later tonight.

TBH I'm feeling really bad about the whole thing. It sucks to have to do that to someone. I know the right decision was made just can't help but feel a bit guilty. 

**tl;dr: I told FIL that we cannot take him in because we need time to be newlyweds and be married but that we could help him with job hunting

I'm sorry for not replying to all of your heartfelt comments. I read every single one of them. Your personal stories have made me feel less lost and alone. The past couple of days have been a blur

I noticed that in the OP I did not offer my brother's defense and what he says actually happened and I figured you all might be curious. His side of the story is that he was only teaching his son how to properly wash and take care of his uncircumcised penis as my nephew has had a history of not properly washing himself and getting rashes/infections. (This is confirmed by my nephew's mother and his pediatrician). However, and demonstrated how he touched it using a crayon as a prop. Now I know kids learn dirty things in school, but I don't think he would say this about his father for no reason. 

It's important to note that during the trial

**One point many of you made was that most abusers have been abused themselves.** In the case of my brother, at least one of those boyfriends abused my brother sexually when he was a child. He never told anyone about it, but it came to light during the investigation. For me, this was a pretty strong indicator of his guilt as I know sexual abuse is a cycle.

**THE SENTENCING:** My brother was sentenced to 12 years prison on 2 counts of indecency with a child. I looked up his mugshot online. Why the fuck did I do that? Bad idea. (From what I understand


**Many of you asked about the mother of my nephew.** Her and my brother have been divorced for about 4 years (since my nephew was about 4 years old). They separated because they got married too young for the sake of the baby and knew it just wasn't right. It was mutual, it is rare that the father is granted custody over the mother, but custody arrangements were handled and agreed upon by my brother and his ex-wife outside of court. He had a more stable job than she did and lived in a better neighborhood. Now of course, my nephew is living with his mother and her new husband.

Now that my brother is actually in prison, and making sure he grows up as normally as possible. I really hope my family can keep it together and just be supportive. 

I will take all of your kind advice to heart and be the awesome aunt I have always been by treating him the exact same as I always have but being watchful for any signs something may be wrong. (even though I was blind to the abuse all these years.)

I'm deeply hurt by/for my brother. I'm filled with rage and sorrow for him. The love and memories I still have of him are tainted now

I've suggested to my mother that my father see a counselor. I've never seen my father so heartbroken. He blames himself for not being there enough for my brother as a kid. (My brother's bat shit crazy mother made it very hard for my dad to see my brother

Thank you again for opening up your hearts to me to share your very private stories, so this has really helped me get it out in a constructive way.

She had been running with our dog nearly everyday (and I don't mean jogging

A week or so later I got the flyer from our university's counseling program and slipped it into her diary. This way she would know I had read it

She didn't bring it up at all for a few days, that being said I won't do it again. She deserves the privacy and what she writes is none of my business.

She went once and then was referred to a specialist outside of the school. She's been visiting this doctor twice a week and I already notice an improvement. She's cut back on exercising

I try to stay awake until she falls asleep to make sure she isn't crying by herself. She still does every once in a while

**UPDATE** So reading the advice I got here, he threatened to harm himself. He called house this morning and told my parents about us and lied about me having sex with him on top of everything else in addition to lies about me stealing from him (which I didn't). 

They confronted me and I told them the truth about what had happened and about everything in general. I never really shared my personal life with my parents and I started crying uncontrollably. I told them how pathetic I felt and how I felt like I was always a piece of shit and a failure. My father was especially upset

He told me he was disappointed in me that I would behave in a non-chaste manner

 He apologized for not being there more and not being available enough and my mother told me that she is just glad that he didn't actually hurt me. She actually joked and said ""don't you wish you had of let me choose your SO's?"" 

I just got done changing my phone number and that doesn't change much knowing he knows my emails, I have plenty of cousins and uncles, some of which came up the hard-way back home. My brother is already riled up, but 1,200 miles away (thankfully). I just want this to be over with as soon as possible. 

**TL;DR** - *broke up with boyfriend, but glad to be out of that bad situation.*

Thank you, and it hurts a lot that a friend like him would betray me like this and I feel like I wasted so much time. I know that people change, and I have to change myself in order to become stronger. I need more self-esteem and I'm realizing that I only dated him because I was so alone, not because I actually liked him. This bad relationship and how it spiraled out of control was a wake up call to me about how empty my life was.

 I had nothing else going on in my life careerwise. Knowing this

Goal 1: Work on myself and get to know myself again.

Goal 2: Try to move out

Goal 3: Meet a nice brown boy that understands where the hell I'm coming from and do everything but sex WITHOUT a hijab on :)

Goal 4: Get a cat.

I came to realize I was in denial and that

As I posted already yesterday

In the letter, so she would know I didn't exaggerate). *Don't worry, I didn't include your handles, so she won't be coming after you.*

When she got home and read the note, which is very uncharacteristic of her), she begged me to come home and talk.

She said in the message that yesterday she was at lunch with the other guy and they both had already decided to end the friendship

After a while

We had quite a long conversation. She told me that the other day, she realized she was developing feelings for him too, and it scared her.

She said she REALLY thought they were just friends

She told me that they didn't do anything physical yet, because neither wanted to cross a line they can't uncross.

I'm choosing to believe her in that.

She told me that even though she was already backing out of the friendship with him

We both cryed for a long time, about everything, including some things that were hard to hear. This went on for a couple hours.

Instead of staying at the hotel by myself, and then had a wonderful night together.

Now

I'm not just letting it slide like nothing happened. But I'm also not giving up on my marriage. I will not. I never will. Some of you may think that makes me a chump, I don't intend on breaking that promise. For better or for worse, right?

Today, that we will be having a different discussion and in person.

I really wanted to thank all of you (at least those of you who offered real advice) for yesterday. I needed to be woken up and I think it happened just in the nick of time. I feel like this dark cloud is finally starting to break up.

**TL;DR** I left my wife a letter expressing all my feelings and fears and left for the night. She called and begged me to come home. We talked for several painful hours, they both admitted that they were developing feelings for each other and decided it would be best to part ways.

My brother had recently come to visit me, he gave me his password and I set everything up, and closed the browser. I guess it had the keep logged in thing on or something. Whatever, did not notice until I saw the messages.

It took me about 20 minutes to calm myself down enough to call my brother. I told him the entire thing above


Apparently boyfriend has had this ring for a good 6 months


I've always held to the mindset that when people are dating, plan for marriage (together). I'm at the maybe-probably yes stage. I only want to do this once. Filing for divorce is something I never want to even consider. I have talked to him about all of this in the past, and told him there were certain things that would need to be done before we'd be ready for marriage. Mostly, it's this: 

* Boyfriend still lives with his parents. That has to end. I've been out on my own since 18, that it's tough, etc.  What the hell is his plan with marriage?! Go live with his mom? Him move in with my roommate and I? He is a hard worker and smart, so I hope I'm not making him out to be a moocher - I'm just furious.

* He is beyond horrible with money. The kid makes more than I do (only by about 5k a year), but he realistically could put half of his paycheck into savings. Then when he gets money in there, he blows it all on some toy. 

Then there's our careers and our future and how ridiculous it's going to be for us. There's the arguments that he doesn't understand me sometimes. There's this

So, he might not even come with me after I do talk to him. He might not want to talk to me ever again. 

I will most likely HAVE to talk to him tomorrow (I can usually put on a happy face no matter what

Today I opened my Linked In account to find a message from a woman I've never met claiming to have been having a relationship with my 56-year old father for the past two years. Aspects of the email's content give me reason to believe that her claim may be true (i.e. she refers to details about my family a stranger wouldn't know).

The tone of her message is bitter (""I've had it basically. I've been taken on a bit of a ride I'd say."") She accuses my father of ""living a double life"" and declares ""I didn't want to do this but I think it should come out. He will feel better for it in the end

She requests that I confront my father and make clear to him that I have received credible information that he has been having an affair. Other than that

**Background**

I am 26-years old

My parents have been married since they were 22 years old. They were high school sweethearts in the country town they grew up in and they have since forged a wonderful life together in the local big city of 4 million people. Their entire adult lives have been devoted to each other.

My father is a highly successful businessman; a workaholic who travels interstate very frequently (i.e. at least two, my sister and me; I had a privileged upbringing.

My mother retired after 30 years as a schoolteacher about 5 years ago. Since then she has lived what many would describe as a life of leisure. That said

**Context**

The Woman's message is not exactly a bolt from the blue. My parents have been having marital problems for about the past 12 months. My father moved out of home in February-March this year (a ""trial"" separation) but recently moved back in to the suburban home he has shared with my mother for 18 years. It appears that my father's decision to move back home was the catalyst for the Woman's message to me (""I guess I'm just a little furious about his having moved back home"").

The trial separation period was an extremely difficult for my family. Essentially

It's important to realise that throughout their marital difficulties of the past 12 months, your life, your reality. Perhaps it's wilful blindness on my mother's part, but she has steadfastly said to me many times that she truly believes that my father has been and will always be faithful to her.

My father moved back to our family home about 2-3 weeks ago. The atmosphere has been tentatively ""happy"". We have all experienced a sense of relief (that he finally ""came to his senses"" and decided not to leave my mother) combined with caution (that his dissatisfaction with his life with my mother would flare up again and he would again flee to the apartment in the city). My personal relationship with him has been strained

**The crux**

I'm having trouble organising my thoughts in reaction to this. I feel I need direction as to the best path to take from here. 

Here is where I'm at so far:

* I have resolved to not respond to the Woman's message.
* I am confident that if I were to show the Woman's email to my mother
* I fear for my father's mental stability if I were to be too ~~confronting~~ provocative in my next steps. He has shown signs of mental instability over the past 12 months and I cannot tell what his reaction would be. Honestly
* My sister adores my father; she historically idolises him. To bring her in on this would shatter that. I feel I need help bearing the load of the Woman's message (and my sister is the logical choice)

Basically

I would really appreciate some direction.

I got many replies encouraging me to be straight forward with her and tell her like it is and I did that. The essence of what I told her was that we aren't moving forward when we meet less than once per month and I hinted that I would be willing to back away if that would make things easier for her. Instead of suggesting a time to meet she went on the offensive and apologized for having a job. 

But I was hellbent on not letting her derail the conversation away from my point so I brought it back and said: ""That wasn't what I meant

""Go and find somebody wonderful that can spend more time with you than I can. You deserve somebody better than me &lt;3"" 

I knew exactly what this is

Once I decided to let her go it felt like I sobered up after a six month hang-over. Sure it was nice walking around with the impression that I had a relationship on the way but that was just that

Not sure where to go from here.,kafrin,378,62,281,"**Update:** When I got home from work last night, we will still be living in the same house.  At least for a few months. The conversation we had was surprisingly simple. We are both being mature and level  headed about this which is all I ask.


My boyfriend 23m and myself 22f have been in a relationship for just over two years. We have known each other since sophomore year of high school, and he will flirt with these girls to get any kind of response from them. We have talked about this, and he knows that it upsets me when he does this. 


Fast forward to last night: I come home from work at about 11:20pm. I notice that the bed is made (which it NEVER is) and that there are womens shoes beside my bed. I walk in the other room, shuts the door, and is trying to get me to go back in the other other room. I notice his heart is beating super hard and he is trying to get me away from the bathroom. So naturally, I see what he is trying to hide from me, and I find a 19 year old girl hiding in my shower, with her bra and shirt off. To put things lightly, I flip shit. I turned the shower on cold and shut the door. 


When I calm down enough to think, and she went into the bathroom to adjust her bra. This particular girl is supposedly bisexual with a girlfriend. I do know that they have been friends for 4 years, and that he has fingered her shortly before we got together. I don't think much else has happened between them, because every time they do talk now, they talk about computers and video games. I had personally never met the girl before this, and my bf said that he brought her over so I could meet her. He knew what time I got off work, but I was done about 15 minutes early, and he was scared that I would flip out


I don't really know what to believe. I'm confident that they didn't have sex (our condoms are in the same spot, he fucks it up somehow...  I do love him a lot, and don't want to break up. I need advice. Please.

Before Kevin leaves, I thought we were friends."" I just said, ""So did I,"" and shut the door.

He hasn't tried to text me or call me anymore, if I could meet her at my storage unit to get the rest of her things. I have no problem with his mom, and I'm certainly not going to keep her away from her furniture, but I have no plans at all to talk to Kevin.

**Clarifications to FAQ in previous posts:**

I just wanted to start with a few clarifications to some questions I kept getting.  This is pretty much a summary of responses that I've already given but I think they got buried in the comments so no one saw them. 

There were multiple questions on my age and how I’m in college.  I’m 17 and will turn 18 at the end of the month (prior to officially starting my sophomore year of college).  Besides my summer birthday I also skipped 4th grade. 

There were also a number of people questioning how I knew I was pregnant so fast.  We had sex June 29th. I should have gotten my period around July 11th but wasn’t really tracking/was in denial until almost the end of July when I finally took a pregnancy test. As of today I am about 8 weeks pregnant (they count from the first day of your last period

Next I just wanted to address the differences between adoption and foster care.  The babies will be adopted and brought into a permanent home soon after birth. Adoption is nothing like the stereotypical foster care home.  I know kids who grow up in foster care and I am aware how bad the system is (or can be in some cases; I’m not saying it is all bad).  There are thousands of couples looking to adopt healthy babies.  There are a lot less people looking to adopt older children.  Putting the babies up for adoption now would give them a loving family as soon as they are born.  They would have new parents from day one and would not be tossed around from home to home (and adoptive parents do not get money from the state for raising the kids; that’s only foster parents).  

Finally I would like to attempt to answer some of the morality questions that have been brought up. Ultimately I know it doesn’t matter what some stranger on the internet thinks of me but I would just like to try to explain my rationale for doing the things I have done.  As I’ve said before, most of which were foolish.  First off, I wanted to fit in.  I wanted to be able to talk to other college girls and not feel like some dumb baby.  Secondly, I was curious.  After hearing so many other girls talk about it I wanted to experience it for myself.  Finally, I did it because I wanted him to like me.  As I said, these were all foolish reasons.  I should never have worried so much about what others thought and should have instead waited and done what was right for me.  I believe in the right circumstances sex is good and binds two people together in love.  But in my case it was a mistake.  I was too young, too naïve, and didn’t know the guy well enough.  In summary, but I think it should be legal.”  For me personally



**Update #3**

Things are going really well with the father.  We are taking things slow and are not going to attempt any sort of physical/romantic relationship while I’m pregnant.  Despite this we still have been spending a lot of time together and are really close.  He told his parents about the situation.  They were super understanding and invited me to dinner so they could meet me.  Meeting them was a little awkward at first but they were super nice and I’m looking forward to getting to know them more. 


Yesterday I told my dad that I’m pregnant.  He had come to move me out of my summer dorm and take me home for the rest of the summer so it was just the two of us.  He was really calm when I told him (which scared me more than him just yelling at me) but after talking seemed more concerned about my safety/health/future than upset.  When we got home I told my mom.  She did not handle it so well.  She’s acting as if I did this on purpose just to spite her.  She won’t talk to me and leaves the room whenever I try to approach her.  My dad said he’ll try talking with her but that she probably just needs space/time.  So far no one has questioned me about how it happened or the father’s identity and I don’t plan on letting them know until everything has calmed down.

I didn't make him kids so he could see them sporadically. I assumed they'd have a dad. But he's being less dad and more new boyfriend to some girl.

How could I go about being in their life more? Now that I'm 27 I feel different about kids than at 20..  and I feel a genetic attachment to these kids. I love them. But I worry that trying to be dad could mess them up... is there a right thing to do?

http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jzc13/my_m25_mothers_funeral_is_monday_and_i_refuse_to/

My mother died last week.  She was the most abusive, Mexico to get pills/drugs that she was addicted to.   She would leave me with a mexican family while she went with her boyfriend to get the drugs.  She would be gone for weeks.  I didn't speak spanish, didn't know them, and they mistreated me.

After I refused to stay at that house anymore she instead took me to a mental institution there in Baja.  She would pay for me to stay there and pick me up later.  I would spend most of my time there sedated.  They just drug you, a rec area, and a library with other presumably crazy people who were all older than I was. 

By the time I was eleven I wouldn't even get in the car with her anymore so she drugged me at home and drove me downthere anyway.  I was at home in the U.S. and next thing I know I'm in Mexico being carried out of the car

To this day I still wake up sometimes not knowing where I am.   I'll reach back to touch the head board on my bed cause I momentarily don't know if I'm still at that place.  As soon as I feel the smooth wooden head board it's relief beyond belief that I didn't reach back and touch the thin metal bars from my head board at the mental institution.

I remember twice being drugged and taken to that place but I don't know how many times that happened.  My older siblings were told that I had stayed behind in Mexico by choice because I wanted to live there.  To this day they still ask me why I would want to leave my family to stay in Mexico when I was little.  That was just tip of the iceberg of the cruel things she did to me.  She wasn't even close to a good mother to my siblings either

But she knew that wasn't true.  My siblings know to this day that wasn't true.  I was the only one of my brothers and sisters who actually liked school, always ditching, horrible grades, etc...

A few years ago while she was hospitalized, and call a nurse to bring her pain medication.  She would just shut down after that.

My siblings are appalled that I refused to attend our great mother's funeral.  My girlfriend sided with them.  I think they all know enough about the abuse that took place to understand me.  But they still pushed me.  My GF said it was a deal breaker for her if I didn't attend.

I didn't attend, I just don't know when.  I'm gonna get counseling and just try to fix myself so that someday I can have a healthy family.

I'm a little concerned about the kind of parents my siblings have become.  But I refuse to continue the cycle of abuse.  It has to stop with me or my mother wins.

**Edit**  My girlfriend and siblings don't know all the details of the abuse, but not the worst of it.  Still, I think they knew enough to respect my decision.  I would definitely respect their decision if the roles were reversed.  She knew enough but she was of the mindset that it would help me heal and get closure if I went. I don't agree with that mentality. In the end, I don't think I belong in a long term relationship until I get some counseling to help be better.  I really think I'm a little crazy.  That's the one thing my mother was right about.


**Edit2  I now have almost 200 missed calls from my ex-girlfriend along with over 40 texts.  I don't have the energy or will to engage in a discussion with her.  I feel like I've been gone for weeks and it's only been hours.  I have moved on

Sorry

My wife and I have been each other's closest (and often

Recently

First

She is adamant about him just being a friend, just normal stuff).

They often text each other all day long (literally)

Now, I'll discover something she didn't tell me or catch her in a small lie (that she said she was doing to protect my feelings). But, still, for the most part, she isn't hiding it.

I'm fairly positive they aren't spending more time together than I think because there isn't any missing time in her schedule that I've seen. No time unexplained.

But I still feel like she is having an emotional affair. I've told her (in no uncertain terms) that this makes me uncomfortable

The problem is, they've started ""texting"" through Hanging With Friends, so she won't know. Which I think is disrespectful and wrong.

People at her work have been speculating that they are having an affair

I've asked my wife

But this is not enough to get her to stop. I'm not even asking her to drop him as a friend

She has even told me that if the situation was reversed, this is not enough for her to stop.

I cannot talk to anyone about it

So

It feels good just to write this all out. Sorry I rambled and jumped around a bit. Just so much information.

Anyway

**TL;DR** My wife has a guy friend that she spends way too much time with and energy on, so I let my feelings be known, but stop short of ""putting my foot down."" My wife hasn't backed off even a little bit, but she has been mostly open about everything (not really hiding it from me). Should I be worried? And if so, what should I do? I will not be leaving her and she knows that, so that threat is not an option.

**UPDATE 1 (1/25 2:22pm MST)** Thank you all so much for your comments and advice. It has all been very eye opening and helpful. I realize now that I am in denial and that, but I feel like I need to wake her up to the fact that I am not going to be okay with this. I'm sure she'll try and call/find me tonight. Don't know if I'll answer when she does. Not sure what is going to happen, but whatever is going to happen, it happens now. I'll post a proper update soon. **(Also, sorry for the confusion about the gender thing. I didn't even realize I listed myself as a female until someone directly asked me if I was a lesbian. That explains a few other slightly puzzling responses too. Haha. But yeah, I'm a guy.)**",,,,

&gt; Why should we care about school? It's stupid and just takes time away from us to be together.

I've been questioning my sexuality for a while now, I broke up with her for that reason. She seemed relatively cool at that moment, but the next day I recieved multiple angry messages from her friends saying that I raped her. Apparently, she didn't take this breakup well. We have never had sex, and only really got to 2nd base a few times (she's a Religious Christian).

I was completely surprised by this. I thought she would accept my reason (which I believe was perfectly valid) and move on. Around half of my friends stopped talking to me

Well

She was not:
I wanted to let you know I'm sorry for what I said. Once you compared my entire career to that of a prostitute I lost my temper and said a lot of things I regret. I hate to end on a bad note because we were both hurt and lashed out. I also wanted to let you know you are right about Rob. Just because I would want to know if I were you and you deserve to know you weren't crazy. I didn't think he felt the same way and I resigned myself to trying to love someone else. I didn't do a good job. How could I when he was constantly there? But then it turns out he's felt the same way all along. He just didn't think he could cross the line. It had to be me because Rob felt as my superior there was no appropriate way to confess his love. Two years of us being stupid and stubborn but we are finally together. We are hashing through it with HR now and they're not giving us any problems. Sorry we put you in the middle of our personal games.
I wish you all the best.

So fuckkk. She is going to live happily ever after

tl;dr They are living happily ever after. I am drinking Newcastle and exploring the possibility of eternal celibacy. 

EDIT:
I don't want to do an update because there is no reason to do one but I would like to just say that I don't begrudge her happiness or want her to catch on fire or anything like that. I'm a little bummed out that it ended this way (because despite this, if it weren't for her fucked up family she would have gone on to be an executive.. not an assistant) but I'm not getting drunk or wasting away. I am just having a few cold ones and playing videogames because I'm an introvert and this is how I cheer myself up.

Anyways

I said a shitty thing to her and it all unwinded from there (and I did start the shit in that conversation- now that it's done

I'm a little dissapointed and a little bitter but I don't hate her or want her to lose her job or get crabs. I just kindof want everyone to be happy and maybe to get laid this weekend. Not that we'll be friends

My boyfriend and I have been together for about four years. We have a two

I immediately assumed it meant he was cheating but decided to wait until we got back from the store to discuss it. When we get back
""Where do you think? Your backseat.""

A bit more time passes before he tells me he has no idea how it got there, since our daughter is there. He has to leave for work at this point. 

We had an issue about a year ago where he was texting several girls and he denied actual cheating. I gave him another chance and told him that he can have female friends but he shouldn't go to extreme lengths to hide it. I told him it's really suspicious to never mention them to me

I found out he's been texting one number every single day since at least May. Sometimes 2-3 times, I call the number. A woman answers, and I just hung up. 

I inform him that a woman answered the phone

I ask why he was hiding his friendship with her from me. He's never even mentioned this woman's name to me.  He said he didn't want to ""freak me out""

He didn't want to tell me about jerking off before because it's embarrassing. I've never had a problem with masturbation

Could that embarrassment have been so bad that he didn't even tell me when I flat out accused him of cheating earlier in the day? Or did he come up with this false story after I found out about his coworker?

He doesn't explain why he was hiding it

I've kicked him out of the house for at least the night. It's tough because our daughter doesn't understand why daddy isn't here. We told her he's staying the night at a friends house. 

Am I doing the right thing? Could he really just be jerking off in the car

Next came the penis envy. She's insanely jealous of my penis, takes pictures of it all the time and desperately wants it to be sentient, or be able to talk back to her. Her having penis envy isn't just wild speculation on my part either, she's explicitly told me several times that she wishes she had one, they're the coolest thing ever, etc.

At first I thought it was cute and played along with everything

We had just finished having sex and I was at the computer looking at something, I think that's enough for today"", and she immediately withdrew and started acting really weird. Eventually this led to a full-on breakdown in tears, and when I asked what was wrong she said ""I just want to touch your penis all the time, and when I can't have it the rejection just crushes me""

I just don't know what to do. I feel that it's endearing and sweet, but it just kills me to see her so heartbroken over this. The other day she even mentioned that she had been looking at prosthetic penises to wear around all day. 

Is there anything I can do about this? Are there any other women who feel this way? I'd really love to hear what you think. Thanks for reading this wall of text.

Welcome to my nightmare.  I've been seeing Jack (fake name) for 4 years.  We have a very open and honest relationship together.  Initially, played in the park, etc.  Jack even tried to teach Mark how to ride a bike.  Unfortunately, Jack had horrendous stories each time he returned.  Mark would start screaming, yelling and throwing temper tantrums.  At first, Mark denied all of this so I ended up following and secretly observing Mark and Jack at a local high school baseball game.  Jack was right.  Mark was screaming at people saying he didn't know Jack and that Jack was scaring him.  Jack and I discussed this at length and I could tell how frustrated he was with the situation.  We decided to hope that it was just a phase and chose to postpone the bonding efforts for a later date.  This did, however, Jack proposed to me.  I know that I love this man more than anyone in the world (except for Mark, but that's an entirely different story).  Basically

I know that once Jack makes up his mind it's nearly impossible to change it.  I don't think there's any hope for my relationship with him until Mark accepts him.  I tried calling Mark's dad and asked him if they could have a conversation (him and Mark) about everything but he just laughed and told me that my love life was my own problem.

I feel so broken right now.  I know I'm supposed to love my son more than anything in the world but I've begun to resent him.  It's not only his tantrums with Jack anymore.  All of the little things that I used to ignore now annoy me to no end.  Please

I thought after all the help everybody gave me

I decided to firstly get the locks changed

I then attempted to get some kind of evidence of her making these threats. Unfortunately, I sent her, ""Were you being serious when you said you'd accuse me of those things?"" She rarely replies to texts and usually comes and sees me herself so when she didn't reply I wasn't surprised. 

I decided to break up with her via e-mail. I told her that we weren't working, I couldn't live with her anymore and I wanted us to break up. I never received a reply, a couple of times she tried to call me on my home phone, but apart from that I haven't spoken to her since. I blocked her from Facebook, despite the fact she goes on there once or twice every few months, if that, and I'm no longer listed as in a relationship with her. 

Thank you all for your help and, hopefully it won't, and I really do hope she gets professional help and comes through this because at one point I really did love her.

I am very aware of his sexual appetite. I understand that (for the most part) men perceive sex differently from women. I also understand that looking  at porn is a normal behavior that nearly everyone does.

I have never had a problem with my boyfriend watching porn or masturbating

It may be because I suffer from bouts of paranoia

Although I can be paranoid at times

I also have never looked through his phone, or any other personal accounts he has. I feel that if I were to do so, I would be invading his privacy in a way that says I don't trust him. I respect his privacy.

I do trust him. That statement that frightens me due to the fact that I have been hurt in the past when I have trusted others with my heart.

I honestly don't know why I decided to google his username, as are his comments. I could be wrong, but I don't think this counts as snooping. Curiosity killed the cat, I guess.

It was kind of shocking. I knew my boyfriend looked at porn

I was a little angry at first

He spent New Year's with me. That one hurt

I am also paranoid now that I have found these comments that this may be only the tip of the iceberg. What else don't I know about? What if he's been privately messaging these women? What if he's been cheating on me? I mean, but anything is possible.

Am I wrong to be hurt by these comments? On that note

Any ideas?,justthestep,348,65,195,"Context: My wife had Connor* when she was 18 with her abusive husband who has a barrage of mental issues. She left the husband when she realized that the next beating might be the one that kills her- I've seen the pictures (during a custody trial) and it's obscene what he did to her. Connor was four. The bastard still gets to see him every other weekend because the state thinks that since he's never laid a hand on him that it means he has a right to it. Nevermind that he terrorized my wife and this means she has to have him in her life or that he is obviously not a good role model..

I met her when he was 7 and we got married when he was 8. Due to him being already being 8 and his father being so abusive, have you done your homework? But no grounding or deciding the punishment. Which has been fine. We share equally the discipline of the two children we have together. 

BUT,think that he is a pretty normal, if angry kid.

Lately it seems like he is grounded or has privleges taken away more than not. Tonight he was not

I am already in bed and don't get up. My wife has always handled him fine before and it's hard for me to let her take control when he's become so aggressive lately. He also is 5'11 and she is 5'1 and dainty. I hear them both shouting

I go out and she's got his fistprint on her face. He left the house. I would've followed him but I am afraid I would've killed him. I've never been so angry before. She just had this look on her face. And all I could think was how his dad used to do that to her all the time. 

He hasn't come home yet but I am not sure what I should do when he does. I'm a bit of a country boy and if I had ever done this my dad would've whooped my ass. But at the same time

I KNOW that if he's doing to use his size and be aggressive that it's past time for me to take over his discipline though. Right? My wife is very upset and went to bed. saying she needed to sleep on this.

Any advice?

I am in the military

The first 3 months I was gone, and emailed me back every time I emailed her. Then literally overnight, she changed... something happened or something maybe, I don’t know what, but she went from being normal and talking to me almost daily to being unresponsive, cold, and heartless :( And that’s the way its been the last 2 months now.

She started screening my calls, she told me that I was less important than anything she is doing and that unless she isnt busy she isnt going to answe the phone anymore.

Then she started ignoring my emails

The last time I called her, I decided to talk about myself, and share what I had been up to recently, thinking that would possibly spark some conversation. She immediately interrupted me with ""I really don’t give a shit about anything that youre doing out there,"" then said, ""so, unless you have something important to say, and she doesn’t even answer me. Then it gets worse.

A week later I brought it up again, and she threatened to leave me! She said ""I am so tired of hearing about this and if you bring it up again I am going to leave you. I am not kidding, if you aren’t more understanding towards me, im gone.""

First off... What the fuck. Second off... What the fuck :( She literally threatened to leave me for asking her to converse with me! Then she had the nerve to say I am not understanding towards her!

I email her, how she's feeling. I ask her every morning if she slept well, and tell her sweet dreams every single night, and even tho she doesn’t respond 90% of the time and when she does its only a one word answer, I still ask her how her day was, every single day. Guess when the last time she asked me how I was? When the last time she asked me how MY day was? Not once since I left for deployment. In fact she made it quite clear now that she ""doesn’t really give a shit about anything I am doing"" in the last phone call I made to her. But I STILL make sure to ask HER. Every single day. And she has the nerve to tell me I am not being understanding enough with her... 

She doesn’t even tell me she loves me anymore. I tell her every night before I go to bed that I love her very much and I miss her. Most of the time she doesn’t even respond. About a quarter of the time I get ""okay"" as a response. And occasionally she goes as far as to reply with ""whatever"" after I tell her I love her.

I don’t understand what I ever did to warrant this kind of treatment from her... All I have done is poured out my love and kindness to her. Given her anything she ever wants. And I get treated like this? I don’t understand why. And I cant even ask her

What can I do? I am scared to talk to HER about it because of her threat to leave me

tl;dr I am in the military

Edit: To answer some questions asked. 

We already have seperate accounts and I give her an allowance that she can use for whatever she wants. All the bills are set up as allotments out of my pay check. The rest goes into my savings account. So, isnt possible.

As for if there was something she could have ""found out""... Certainly not. A little more back story perhaps, started dating in high school, and got married 2 years ago. So, basically... She knows everything about me, I have never kept anything from her. I dont know if I could say the same about her, but I would like to think so.

Edit 2: The best advice I have recieved so far is to talk to a third party, etc and try and figure out what is going on that way... Fortunatly my sister lives down the road and hangs out with her regularly, I think I will try and ask my sister if she knows anything. I havnt talked about this to anyone, and I was really wanting to avoid that option as the last thing I need would be ""your talking behind my back??"" added on to everything. But I will ask my sister if she can talk to my wife, and not tell her I told her anything.

Edit 3: I decided to knuckle down and man up about it and send her an extremely lengthy email laying at all out... Everything I feel, then she no longer values our marriage so it wouldnt matter anyway and I have nothing to lose. But if she was throwing an empty threat, this could mean a breakthrough. So, the deed has been done, the email sent, I am awaiting her reply. I will post an update on her response, if she even responds at all.

Edit 4: Update. So, she is avoiding the confrontation, but possibly has taken everything I said to heart?... I am still unsure. But that is more than she has said to me in over a month, so... If this is the beginning of things getting turned around and she continues to treat me like she cares from now on, we shouldnt have a problem, but we will see. I asked her if she was going to avoid the email I sent her, and her response to that was to tell me how she cant wait for me to be home and do the gardening in the back yard with her... So I took that as a yes,,1369726021.0,t3_1eyywb

The English ones, he pointed out, are a cheap Chinese brand they like to hand out over in SA.  I didn't question him any more.

The tl;dr from my previous post: 

My coworker (50F) of five years has been on my (28F) back for ages, file a complaint with HR, or ask to be transferred. Am I overreacting to a little bit of name-calling, or am I legitimately upset?

First, I walked into my meeting with a much more solid idea of what I wanted to get out of it. The results were not what I wanted but at least I know I handled things well.

My supervisor and the county supervisor met with Jane before they met with me. They spoke to her for quite a long time. I wasn't in the room for their meeting but I believe she was given a written warning. When she came out she was visibly upset. 

My meeting was short and not as productive as I had hoped. My supervisor and the county supervisor both agreed that Jane’s actions required a disciplinary response, I quickly re-told the story from my previous post- Jane’s anger at my absence when my father was dying, reviewing my casework without permission and for no real reason, monitoring my enter/exit times from the building, etc. Those were all either public incidents or things that I could back up with paperwork. I left out the weird creepy thing where she told me to watch my back simply because that’s her word against mine and I have no way to prove that she said it. 

I feel like I was able to present my story to my supervisors calmly, but I was worried that going over it all again would upset me. Luckily, I felt well prepared for the meeting and remained totally calm throughout the whole thing. After my supervisors told me they couldn't tell me if/what disciplinary action was taken I asked to file a formal complaint with HR. My supervisors told me that there was no guarantee any action would be taken as a result of the complaint to HR, but they didn't try to discourage me from filing it. I believe that creating a paper trail is worthless to me, but may be very valuable to the next person who gets into this position with Jane. 

After hearing my side of the story and that I wanted to file a formal complaint, so she hasn’t had much direct contact with me. She said I had an excellent reputation in the office and she also hoped I would decide to stay. I know they're just words but it was nice to hear them.

I mentioned in a couple comment replies on the last post that I was planning on transferring counties anyway. This definitely lit a fire. My husband is deploying this month and he’ll be gone for nine months. We were already planning on moving when he got back (closer to my family, get a couple rooms repainted, and get it ready to sell. 

After I had said what I wanted to say, they brought us into the same room, and I listened to what was hands-down the most half-assed, insincere apology I’ve ever heard. When she finished, I told her that I was badly hurt by what she said but I appreciated and accepted her apology, and I hoped that we could work together without any further incidents. Who knows if that was the right thing to say. At least I was telling the truth- she did hurt me, but I want to work out my time here in peace. Accepting the apology seems like a pretty empty gesture but I couldn’t imagine receiving an apology- even a lame one- and refusing to accept it. So

I can’t thank you guys enough for all the advice you gave me. I wouldn’t have gone into that meeting so calmly and with such confidence if I hadn’t heard so much good advice from everyone here. It is really

**tl;dr** Unsurprisingly, given a written warning. She was not fired. My supervisors supported my decision to file a formal complaint with HR and my decision to transfer in the next few months. Jane apologized- probably because she was told to- and I accepted, expressed my hope that we could work together peacefully for the remainder of my time in this office, and we shook hands. It wasn't a perfect outcome, but I feel like I handled the situation today as best as I could. Thanks SO MUCH again for the advice, opinions, and support. You guys are awesome.

----

Late one night, so I went there. I'm walking out, and what do I see? Her and a close male friend - who she's confessed to having an attraction to - are coming back drunk from a party, and she's inviting him up to her apartment (her roommates are still out).

My immediate reaction was to make my presence known. Not confrontational, I'm reeling, but I figure the best thing to do at the moment is play it off and accept that story, so we all head up, eat some food, and drink some beer. He leaves. I tell her I'm going home, and she insists on coming with me back to my place. We fight in the car - I demand to know the real story - and the tearfully insists that it wasn't what it looked like.

We get to my place, I see it - ""But you have him"". I freak out, check the sent messages. While we were fighting in the car, she'd texted him ""Why do I have to like you so much?"" I confront her about it, tell her she's a cheater and to get the fuck out, etc etc... but she's sobbing uncontrollably at this point, and after a few minutes of screaming I break down and we hug and she explains that her feelings are all mixed up but that nothing happened and she'd never cheat on me. I don't completely believe her, and make it very clear to her that if she ever gives me another reason to doubt her it will mean the immediate end of our relationship with no chance for explanation.

Fast forward three years, we're looking at houses and marriage. I'm absolutely in love with her, and I want to spend my life with her... but I don't trust her. She hasn't given me any reason to doubt her since then, but part of me wonders if she's just gotten better at hiding it, or if she was *always* good at hiding it and it was just dumb luck that I caught her that one time.

Sometimes I check her phone, there's always a thought that says *maybe she has someone over, and wants advance warning*. It's paranoid and stupid and I hate it, but I blame her for that, too - I was never like this with anyone else. I think I actually want to find something, anything, that would vindicate me for the fact that I haven't forgiven her, and I just end up feeling shitty for not being able to let the past stay buried

It's come up a couple of times - where I'd beg her to just tell me the truth, she was going to cheat, but that fate swooped in and stopped it and she couldn't be happier about that. I'd understand that and love her for it. But still she denies it, and to this day maintains that she would never have cheated. It's an open wound - how can we close it and let it heal, and let me stop being so damn paranoid, if she's *still* lying to my face about it?

But then I put myself in her shoes

I love this woman. I want to marry her. I want what happened three years ago to fade away and stop casting a shadow on our relationship. But I really don't think I'll ever truly trust her 100%, and another part of me is saying that I'm just one of those dumb fucks who keeps dating someone long after they should have called it quits, and it's all incredibly confusing. I feel like I'm overthinking it and overfeeling it and I'm just so *saturated* with this shit that I can't tell what's wise and what's not.

As of 1 January, I told his father that he would have as much time with our son as he wanted (staying overnight during the week, full weekends, etc) so long as our son primarily stayed with me.

On Monday

I was under the impression that he was going to stay there for one night, until I got this from him Tuesday evening:

""I didn't take [our son] to daycare because it is raining. he is going to stay with me until we get this figured out because i dont trust that you two [myself and my husband] wont try to take him. i went over my decree and contacted a lawyer""

When I asked where our son was, and will only communicate through text messages. 

I have not received any responses, from his father since that conversation on Tuesday, 29 Jan 2013.

I spoke with an attorney yesterday, and all have told me the same thing: since (if we were still under the every-other-week system) this week is technically his dad's week, that nothing can be done until and unless his father fails to return him on Sunday.

My son has not been to daycare all week, so I called the police station at noon today and asked them to go do a 'welfare check' - basically just go over there and see if anyone's home, make sure they're alive. The officer called me back, and told me no one was home, no vehicles in the driveway, and all doors and windows locked tight.

I called the police station again for another welfare check at 9pm, doors locked. My son goes to bed by 8pm, and he and his father are not home. 

His father has threatened to ""just take [our son] and leave, and that his father hasn't kidnapped him and disappeared.

**EDIT** Just some points for clarification: Since I've been back stateside, and his doc said they were fine, just itchy. My ex then asked my parents to pay to have his house bug bombed since he couldn't afford it. I've also been weighing my son after picking him up from his dad, and he generally weighs 2-3 lbs less after being there. Doctors have frequently told me that he is underweight for his age, but he eats just fine at my house. I even give him PediaSure with his breakfast every day. My brother-in-law(his boss) pays for his car insurance because he cannot afford it and he needs his truck for work. I drove 20 minutes each way every morning on my weeks so my son could go to daycare near his dad, because he can't afford to drive to a daycare near me. My ex also has had his utilities turned off frequently due to non-payment. So, no heat, or stove use in the dead of winter. And my family has always bailed him out when this happened, no stops. My son was 9 months old at the time, but I could never understand why he didn't stop and get a hotel...he HAD THE MONEY FOR IT. I told him to stop and do the trip in two days

I told her that I don't want to get married unless she is 100% sure about me.  I told her she needs to go to her parents for the weekend and really think about what it means to be married.  She wasn't happy about it

*sorry for the new throwaway

Alright

I went over to her house last night and told her I needed to talk to her about this again and just clarify things. Again

I sat her down on the bed and I asked her what

The bar has 3 other girls that play there. 2 of them were supposed to be there. I guess when he said there would only be 2-3 other guys

So I asked her what exactly SS meant. Unfortunately for most of you- and this is probably mostly my fault - it doesn't mean Safe Sex party, the stripper pole reference, and some advice from friends on what it could possibly mean.

It means ""Secret Society"" party. I was weary about that answer until she showed me texts from another girl that works there

Even then, or written disapproval of his actions that can later be used in a case against him if the treatment continued.

She said

To that I said, I won't feel comfortable with any of this. I want you to know this isn't an ultimatum, but I just need you to know where I stand.""

She promised me she would. Then, ""I would never do anything to jeopardize this. I never want you to lose respect for me, and I feel so stupid for not just saying No immediately. It's disrespectful toward me and even more so toward you.""

So I did ask, if she doesn't take action when she gets back from home, it's over. But as of now I have every reason to believe she's been faithful and upfront.

She didn't hide the texts from me. She just didn't think it necessary to tell me because she didn't see the outrageousness of his attitude. She told me about the party before it was supposed to happen

I truly believe this is a case of her misjudging a situation she previously felt comfortable with. Again... I'll update when/if the action towards the boss takes place if you guys want me to.

TL;DR Went to my girlfriend's last night. Talked about every question I had in my mind. She calmly answered and explained and clarified. And reinforced the idea she was being truthful and honest. She promises to take action against the boss when she returns home. (She doesn't work until then anyway)

**EDIT** okay everyone. Thanks again for sticking it through with me. Thanks to all those who continue to give me support, I feel so much better about all of this. She's already started the process of putting something together toward him. If you all want, I'll update when and if that happens. Till then, I'm off. Thanks again for everything, Reddit!

It didn't really start bothering we until lately. She has been meeting him at his house alone before playing. Now she meets him to play tennis and no longer even bothers to mention it to me. This last weekend she left in the middle of a beautiful sunny day to  play for 2 hours leaving me with the kids. She has on occasion driven right past my work and gone to play tennis with him and then was too busy stop and see me. Last night it really dawned on me when she left her facebook open and I noticed hundreds of messages between them. So here is my wife exchanging hundreds of messages with another man

Now I'm certain that there isn't anything physically going on between them but I just think that she should consider how this makes me feel (please no lawyer up and hit the gym comments). How would she feel if I was spending alone time with one of her best friends? The best word I can come up with for how I'm feeling is emasculated. I don't even know how to bring it up without appearing jealous and controlling.

Maybe she is attracted to him I'm just not sure anymore. I think what really bothers me the most is the fact that she doesn't even consider that this would bother me

Should this bother me? Am I over-reacting? If I bring it up with her does it make me look petty and weak? 

tl;dr Wife is spending a lot of alone time with her workout buddy.

Hi guys


Thanks so much for your kind words and advice. It's been a tough time. I convinced my wife to go for one more counselling session so we could agree an arrangement for me to see my son. 


I know a lot of you believe I should have took my son away from her and out of that environment. I couldn't agree more. However, to me, to the house. My main concern is my son but I also don't want my wife to hurt herself. I want to explore every avenue before going to the courts. There is no turning back when we stand in front of a judge. I take my wedding vows extremely seriously. I vowed to be with her in sickness and in health. She is very sick.


The counselling session went better than expected. We agreed that I would take my son for half the week, which before had been littered around on tables and other surfaces. I can't tell for sure, but she does seem more lucid. I didn't smell it in the house.


In the meantime


Right now


Thanks for everything guys. I'm cautiously optimistic.

1373716885.0,1i7pwy,Me[32/f] just found out something terrible about my [32M] boyfriend,atthedesk,380,108,124,"We have only been dating 3 months but we are really into each other. We've told each other we love each other. We have soooo much in common and so much fun together it's ridiculous. 

So he left his gmail open on my computer. I sit down to check it a few days later forgetting it is his account signed in and find emails responding to adds he has posted on craigslist asking for NSA M on M sex. It's detailed. He went into great detail about what he likes, pics of his butt with a dildo in it. His phone number. In the trash there are emails that seem like men may have went to his house. 

Also

The dates of the emails range from 2 days ago to four months ago.

When I asked him about it- over the phone- he says he was just playing around. I didn't mention the most extreme pics. He said he never expected anyone to show up. He said he isn't worried about someone coming over because people are just playing around on craigslist. 

I think this is crazy, I am hurt. We won't see each other till Sunday evening. We will talk about it again but I don't even know if it's worth it. I think the emails and pics went WAAAAAY to far for joking. If he would admit he had a problem we could talk about it but he is adamant that it was all jokes-just messing with people. We have begun to include some BDSM in our sex life and he wanted me to be the dom....just like in his emails to random men. 

He has met all my friends and I am too embarrassed to ask any of them for advice. Please help!!!

EDIT: I texted him and told him it was over. I told him it was not because of the bisexuality but because of the dishonesty. He replies and says he is very sorry it happened that way, lonely, when he gets off work sometimes he drinks way too much and replies to adds on craigslist. He said lately he started taking it further to see what people would do and how far he could take it. He said he would never actually meet someone. That he has never had sex with a man but has thought about it. Said it's something he doesn't need to be happy. I asked him all sorts of questions about the emails and ads and he was transparent. I am still not sure if he is honest about meeting people.


He is from a small town in the midwest. I am too so I know the stigma and prejudice associated with homosexuality or bisexuality. He told me the replying to ads started shortly before he met me and then continued. He said he now understands how it was cheating-even if he didn't meet anyone. He said he told me it was a joke at first because he was caught off guard. I told him all he needed to do was talk to me-that I am open and if I love someone and they need me to stick a dildo up their ass then I would-for real. I told him there are so many different facets of sexuality and it's ok to be different but of course it is not ok to deceive people-myself or the people in the ads. I told him went on a few dates with a bi man and I discussed it with him-that this man was very up front with it and comfortable with his sexuality. He and I never ended up going that far. 


Anyway we talked about much more. I am still not sure but I feel good about it. I feel like he hid it because he was ashamed. He does have an addictive personality, that he didn't want to be that person and he didn't want to lose me. He wants to continue with his goals he has been putting off and me catching this was a wake up call for him. 


I think I am going to try it. I may be completely wrong and get burned....but what if he is telling the truth? Everyone here save one is saying ""run and run fast"" and that is what I thought before I spoke with him. But I feel like he was being transparent with me and I can understand his embarrassment and why he felt like he had to hid his desires. As far as if I believe whether or not he acted on them


I know I deserve a good man. I am a good woman! I have a great job, romantic, fun, adventurous and a helluva good cook. 

Sorry for the wall of text but I have one more thing. I can also understand because I posted a few ads myself. I am interested in BDSM and posted ads regarding that in the same place he did. I gave out my phone number to a few people and actually ended up meeting someone. Granted I was not in a relationship at the time. But I was way to shy to ever tell anyone I was in an actual relationship with. Way to shy. 


So fire away- tell me I am making a bad decision. Or am I? I hope not


Edit again: I broke up with him a few days ago. Too much way to early in our relationship and the trust is gone.

Hello

Thank you for all of your comments and advise on this matter.

I went to court yesterday. I went on my own. My SO did offer to come along but I declined saying this was my past and he was my future and that I didn't want to two to merge.

I saw my ex. There was no emotional twang at all. I wonder what I ever saw in him. He didn't even dress up remotely smart.

Because of my ex's late submission of evidence

This time I am going to create a stack of solid evidence. I have arranged two witness statements from people in my life who were close to me when I had my melt down. I have paid the private fees for my doctor to give me a full disclosure on the state of my mental health at the time. I have spoken to my therapist who is going to write a candid report on my behalf to uphold this.

I have also contacted my bank and requested the last three years on my bank statements that show that no loan money was ever transferred since I met the guy.

I have to go full disclosure on my medical and financial history to have a chance I guess.

I am happy at least that the judge is willing to go into the details of the case.

During the judge talking about mental health difficulties, she was fit enough to sign a financial contract. If she wasn't maybe all of this should be taken into account in terms of her child."" He said that by looking at me straight in the face.

The judge kinda tore him a new asshole at that point.

Not to say anyone who responded was wrong in telling me NOT to tell him. If I was younger and with someone for much less time, it would be easier to keep it to myself.  

We are both off of work today

I told him I had cut Mike (the other guy) off because I felt like our friendship was unhealthy and that it crossed boundaries. I did admit that some flirting was going on and some pictures were traded

I also told him that I became attracted to Mike, including facebook, and I took the lock off of my phone (though he knew that, too) just to show him I had nothing to hide. I haven't heard from Mike at all since I told him that we needed to break it off. 

He looked at me like he was completely broken and said he needed some time to sort things out

Christ. The original question was whether my doubts about allowing us to videotape during sex were reasonable. I was surprised to find that many redditors said he was selfish and manipulative- the comments put certain things he has said/done in a new light
I did a lot of thinking. When I came home, even with the compromise I stated earlier. (No face in the video.)He insinuated that, without the tapes, he’d be tempted to cheat on me. When that didn’t work, he said, “You have a choice. Either we make new videos without your face, or I recover the old ones.” I could not talk him out of this. (One of you saw this coming, you rock! Thanks.) 
This entire thing was really upsetting. I’ve decided to end the relationship. I’ve appeased him for now, I will permanently delete them. After that I’m breaking up with him.

Then he told me that the therapist suggested that he move out in order to have a space to work through things that doesn't have a relation to me in any way. He also told me that he was going to do it, he had changed his mind again. I literally begged him not to do it, but he wouldn't change his mind.

I have a new baby to take care of, or how to cope. How am I going to keep my marriage from disintegrating?

**Edit**: He loves our daughter very much. He is active in taking care of her when he is at home. He is more affectionate with her than with me

**Edit 2**: Thank you everyone for your suggestions and kind words. I'll update as soon as there is something to update. In the meantime

Yes

Alright so fair warning - this is going to be a very, this is a throwaway account.

**How We Met**

So I met a girl back in December.  She was a bay host for a large TopGolf location, I took her back home with me, and you all know what happened next.  I've never been the type to pursue a one-night stand, but this girl was amazing.  Perhaps the ONS should have been my first red flag.  She was a blast to hang out with, extremely outgoing and personable, and oh my God she had one of the best bodies I'd ever seen.  She was/is a fitness competitor and fitness model and has been in a few fitness magazines.  The sex that night was pretty bad because it was awkward for her since it was a ONS, but that was the only bad sex we ever had.  Everything after that was unbelievably good.

**Growing Closer**

After that night we started going on dates.  She was living in a house with a guy that she called her brother who was really just someone that she grew up with that her family kind of adopted.  I always thought that was a little weird

**Confessions About Her Past**

During the first month of our dating relationship

1. She had been married before.  She married a guy several years before that was busted in a testosterone drug ring bust.  FBI raided their house and everything.  I thought that was the reason she divorced him

2. She had been arrested for felony theft almost 5 years prior and was on felony probation set to expire at the 5 year mark.  Her co-defendant was her jackass ex husband.

3. Her dad is now mentally retarded as a result of his rampant methamphetamine use.  Apparently she didn't even meet him until she was 10 years old or so.  She is his legal guardian.

4. She used to live with a boyfriend who turned out to be married with kids.  Apparently this guy had to travel a lot for his job.  Eventually his wife found out what was going on

5. She briefly mentioned in passing to me early on that she was on her way to pick up some meds, but no longer did.  To be honest, I didn't notice too many symptoms, but really I probably didn't know what to look for and overlooked what I did notice because this girl could do no wrong in my eyes.

As someone who was raised in a loving, and I was already falling for her at this point.

**The Sex**

Oh God the sex.  I already mentioned the sex was good

**Falling in ""Love""**

So as time went on, but it wasn't official yet.  I asked her to be my girlfriend at the beginning of May, and she exclaimed ""Finally!!""  She was happy and so was I, and all was perfect.  Soon I began to grow crazy about this girl.  She was absolutely perfect for me, and I knew I wanted her in my life forever.  Somewhere around the beginning of June, I told her that I loved her.  It was genuine, but she didn't say it back.  She joked that I waited to tell her after I already knew she felt the same way.  So basically she told me she loved me without saying ""I love you.""  That was okay with me.  I've been in enough relationships to know that I want it to come natural when she's ready.  The last thing I want is for her to say it and not mean it.  She did say, that she had made a personal decision not to tell someone she loves them unless she has decided they were the one she was going to marry.  Not sure why but yeah sure whatever.  She also told me that her therapist said she would never be able to be in a real relationship unless she fell in love with someone before having sex with them.  I always thought that was complete bullshit

About a week later we went out of state for my cousin's wedding.  We had separate hotel rooms because I was staying with my cousin and brother, talk, etc.  It was on this trip that she sat me down and, with tears in her eyes, told me that she loved me too.  It was completely heartfelt, and it made me cry too (I'm not a crier).  We had already talked a few times about what life would be like together, and this was validation that she seriously considered me to be marriage potential.

**The Rocky Road**

At about the same time, he was a complete asshole to her and they fought constantly.  In fact, he was such an asshole that she never wanted me to come over when he was there.  I met him twice, and he was nice to me at the time, but she didn't want it to get to a point where I had to stand up for her should the fight while I was there.

Anyway, touching her, etc.).  It was all stuff she used to love and even initiate on her own.  But for whatever reason she just didn't like it anymore.  At the same time, she would often take her anger out on me.  She would occasionally want to argue just for the sake of it.  She also mentioned a few things that she disliked about my personality:  I'm somewhat arrogant and think I'm always right, I judge people a little bit too much, and I talk over people on occasion.  She was right.  She wasn't afraid to point out my flaws and I loved her for it.  So I sat her down and we promised to work on the issues that we each had.

**Things Start Falling Apart**

And then she began to grow distant, but I definitely remember not believing her.  During that phone call, her mom basically disowned her, and my ex was distraught.  More on this later.  We began to get into more and more arguments, and we stopped having sex around the beginning of June.  The wedding was the last weekend we ever had sex.  I knew that she was extremely stressed and had a rough past with relationships, so I tried to be as understanding as I could.  She was trying to find a job, her mother cut her off, a few emotional.  Fortunately for her

She asked for time and space, an band-aid of sorts as an attempt to bring us back together.  I know, I know, that's not how it works.  Even though I backed off quite a bit, we still hung out with about 2-3 times per week.  We would grab lunch together, take afternoon naps, take her dogs to the park, and that led to one particular man hiring her as his personal assistant of sorts for the games.  Basically

Around the same time, and to this day I still have trouble imagining that he's not her brother.  She explained that she didn't really have a choice but she understood if I never wanted to talk to her again.  She didn't have the means to move out until the point she actually did move out.  She's hated the guy's guts since I first met her, they fought constantly, and she had always talked about wanting to move out.  So I empathized with her.  I knew she was struggling to get away from him and understood why she lied about it.  I wasn't okay with it by any means, but I loved her enough that I decided I wouldn't end the relationship over it.  We left two days later on a trip to a beautiful part of Colorado that I had planned for her a few months prior.

**The Poker Games**

Since she no longer had a job, she wanted space, she no longer would stay the night with me, and some rich guy was paying her to help bring him drinks and give him neck rubs while he played poker.  Can you feel my insecurity?

I honestly believe that everything with this poker guy was strictly professional.  I mean he is a complete shit stain in my book seeing as how he's married but has a few girlfriends on the side and plays poker nearly non-stop.  However, I began to grow suspicious.  I didn't think that she had cheated on me, but I can't even begin to explain the terrible thoughts that went through my head about what she could be out doing at these ""poker games"" while I was laying in bed.  Eventually I got to the point where I wanted to talk about what was wrong with our relationship.  We were clearly past the point where some aspects of the relationship were irreparable.  But she didn't want to talk about it.  I would ask and she would shut me down and tell me she didn't want to talk and to quit asking.  That wasn't a good enough answer so we'd fight and I'd leave.  But after every fight I'd eventually realize that I wasn't giving her the space she asked for, so I would apologize and reiterate that I loved her more than I even had the ability to explain.  But I still couldn't help but think that something else might be going on that she didn't want to talk about.

**My Breakdown**

During the past couple of weeks, ""But I thought you said you were trusting?""  I am, but I liken this to the old Russian proverb ""Trust but verify.""  I trusted her, but I'm not stupid enough to trust her completely when she's grown so distant and begun to act so shady.  I drove by maybe a total of 4 or 5 times and noticed that she would get home about 2 or 3 hours later than the times she would tell me the next day.

A few nights ago I'd had enough.  The guy that she worked the poker games for had picked her up earlier for a game.  I laid in bed and began to think that maybe he never dropped her back off at home, I called two more times until she answered and demanded that she come outside.  She resisted again, but maybe 15 seconds later she opened the front door.  Fuck!!  She came outside and I basically expressed to her that I feared she was cheating on my with this poker guy.  She absolutely flipped out on me (rightfully so) and told me to stay out of her life and never contact her again.

So a few days go by.  I texted her several times to explain that I was beyond words as I tried to express how sorry I was.  I made the biggest mistake of my life

**One More Night**

After sending that text, and I stopped going to church.  I'm still strong in my faith, but I know that I've been slipping away for far too long.  So I prayed a long prayer and had a heart-to-heart with God.  I apologized for wandering from Him and told him that even though I ultimately wanted his will for my life, I had to fix this mistake I had made first.  I confessed my love for her and prayed that she text or call me that night as I laid in bed.  About an hour later, she texted me and asked to come stay the night.  I knew my prayer had been answered, and I couldn't have been happier.  We cuddled, we kissed, but she was short in most of her responses.  She started her new job yesterday

So fast forward a bit I'm laying in bed and I get the feeling that everything isn't going to get better as I had hoped.  God had answered my previous prayer, show me and I'll work hard as hell to give her the world.  If she's not the one, show me that too.  And if it turns out she's ever cheated on me or ever will, let me know so I won't waste my time.  And please let her call me as I lay here.  I haven't talked to her all day and am dying to ask her about her new job.

**She Wants to Be a Prostitute**

Sure enough, including her recent financial problems, but it's not until later that she drops the atomic bomb on me.  She said, ""ThrowAway_02468, I'm going to be 100% honest with you because I don't know how else to say this.  I'm going to start sleeping with men for money starting on Friday.""  And there it was.  It was the single worst feeling I've ever felt in my entire life.  She insisted that she was dead set on doing it.  I offered to help her by giving her money or letting her live with me for a while or whatever else I could possibly do, but she didn't want any of it.  She had met a high-class prostitute a few nights before that was a friend-of-a-friend, and I guess this girl must have explained to her all of the positives without any of the negatives.

I still can't believe it as I'm typing this.  I'm in utter shock.  No fucking way am I letting this happen.  I used to work as an prosecution intern for one of the largest cities in the country.  I've taken a few prostitution cases to trial and I've investigated dozens more.  I've seen firsthand what happens when girls start down this road

**The Confrontation**

So as I said, but she never replied.  I texted her that I was on my way and would bang on her door and wake her roommates up if I had to if she didn't come out to talk to me.  She swore to God that she would shoot me if I showed up (hmm felony probation violation for possession anyone?).  So of course like any normal person would I went to her house at 1:00 am.  I love this girl, and I will stop at nothing to keep her from ruining her life.

I must have called her 25 times while driving to her house.  She ignored every single one of them.  I had to say something to get her out of the house to talk to me, etc.  Perhaps the most hurtful thing was her response when I said, ""You're going to pay for this phone.""  She said, ""That's fine.  I'll pay for it with the dick that's in me this weekend.""  Un-fucking-believable.

So that's pretty much it.  I flagged down a cop and made him follow me to her place to get a few of my things.  I am still in complete disbelief at all of this.  I was nothing but good to her.  Sure

**Going Forward**

At this point I'm considering going one of two routes:

1. File i) a claim in small claims court to recover the cost of my phone, has my apartment key, and threatened to take a baseball bat to my Tahoe.  God forbid she uses that key to enter my apartment with a gun.  If she does, she's dead.  I sleep with my carry weapon and wouldn't hesitate to use it in that instance.  The only problem is that I gave her that key, so I gave her permission to be there.  A TRO revokes that permission and would help me in the 0.001% chance that it actually came down to that, so I'm strongly considering it.

2. Do nothing and move on.  Buy a new phone

Thoughts?  I'm going to get out of town for a few days to cool off.  Congratulations to whoever read all of this!!


**tl;dr**:  I completely fell in love with a girl that loved me back.  We had the perfect relationship for a couple of months.  She has a shitty family, and is struggling financially after losing her job.  She also lied to me for 7 months by telling me that her ex boyfriend she was living with while we dated was her brother.  But alas I forgave her because she hated his guts the entire time.  Things eventually began to fall apart as she grew distant, and I grew suspicious as she began to work private poker games late at night.  I stupidly accused her of cheating, and she completely flipped out and didn't respond to my texts or calls for a few days.  I apologized endlessly for what I considered to be the biggest mistake of my life, and she came to stay the night with me as if she was ready to work things out.  Out of the blue, she called me last night and said she was going to start sleeping with men for money.  I've done everything I can to stop it, but she's made up her mind.  I showed her nothing but unconditional love and support


**Edit 4:30pm CST:**

Haha wow some of you guys really don't like me.  Awesome!  That means I have a lot of room for improvement.  Thank you for pointing it all out to me.  I'll admit that I have been somewhat controlling and narcissistic both in the relationship and when writing this story.  These are things that she has pointed out to me throughout the relationship and things that I have been working on.  Obviously I still have some work to do.

Yes, and (3) not wanting to have sex or make out.  I became very insecure with the relationship and, as a result, became overbearing.  I had an unquenchable desire to know what was really going on.  Yes I was being controlling so far as that goes.  More on that in a couple of paragraphs.

I've known throughout this entire relationship that I was way in over my head merely because of the fact that I am not adequately equipped to handle someone who is bipolar.  I've never had any close bipolar friends or or family members

Anyways, I'm not trying to work it out with her or anything like that.  I just wanted to know her reasoning for a couple of things.  For some reason, having answers to things gives me some kind of closure.  Yes, I know, that is controlling behavior, blah blah blah.  It's the kind of behavior that has likely driven her away from me because I want answers to everything.  Obviously I wasn't approaching this the correct way during the relationship.  But the way I see it, knowing 100% what is going on, is better than being kept in the dark.  You may disagree

1. She swears up and down that she is **NOT** going into prostitution.  ""Bullshit!"" you say?  Yeah I said that too.  Anyways she said that she was intoxicated.  In addition to that, so she does it with entirely unreasonable arguments and reasoning.  When that happens I tend not to realize what's going on until it's too late and I've already blown up the situation by trying to find some logic in her irrational reasoning.  Hint: There isn't any!  I'm just going to blame that one on being a lawyer.  The prostitution thing was completely out of the blue, and this explanation is MUCH more in line with what I've come to expect from her.  We've only had 2 or 3 of these types of arguments, but nowhere near this scale.  This was by far the worst episode she has ever exhibited.

2. She says she has never cheated on me.  She says this in the same text message where she says she loves me but wants nothing to do with me after all of this.  So she doesn't want to get back together.  In my mind, that she cheated on me.  Maybe not, but she has nothing to lose by telling me if she wants nothing to do with me now.  Believe it or not, I'm inclined to believe her on this point.  And for those of you saying she was banging her ex (brother guy), that is not the case.  She absolutely hates the guy and has ever since I've known her.  Every now and then they'll have a very short time period where they get along, but 95% of the time it's volatile.  It's a weird situation, I know.  She got into a position where she was unable to move out and ended up relying on him after losing her job.  My city is not very dog friendly, it was ridiculously outside the range of what she could afford.  In a sense she really was stuck.  However, but she seriously fucking hates the guy.

3. She says that I am the biggest source of stress in her life and that I push too much.  Now this I can concede to.  I chalk this up to me not knowing how the hell to handle things when the intimacy stops.  My reaction was to push to find out why.  I just had to know.

**My Question(s):**  This is for all you assholes getting on to me about not asking a question. :)  What do you think about all of these new developments?  Do you believe them *objectively*?  Why or why not?  And for those of you that know


Sooo it appears things have taken somewhat of an anticlimactic turn.  I apologize to all of the soap opera fans.  Maybe she's not really considering being a hooker.  It seemed out of character for her in the first place (yes,Breakups,False,,t5_2qjvn,1374096531.0,m-be breakups,True

1370691109.0,1fx6wk,My boyfriend (23M) wants me (23F) to have sex with another guy and I don't want to,Sumph,364,96,152,"We've been dating a year now, once I'm in a relationship that's it

I told him that, and that it would make him happy. He's really focused on the idea that I don't want to do it because I think I'd be betraying him, but that's not it. I just don't want to do it.

I've been trying to watch my tongue around him lately because if I'm watching one of my shows and comment on the attractiveness of a celebrity or make a joke about wanting to make out with them or something, I would do him in a second,"" but I wouldn't *actually* want to do it. My boyfriend doesn't realize that though and takes it as proof that I actually want to do it with other guys deep down.

I really wish this whole mess would just go away. I feel bad for my boyfriend for having a fantasy that he won't be able to fulfill with me

Another thing is, ever has to worry about getting cheated on and he's acting like that's a *bad* thing. Sex is important to me, not just physically but emotionally, and he wants me to just give it away to someone else.

Tl;dr: Boyfriend wants me to have sex with someone else to fulfill a fantasy of his but I don't want to

**UPDATE**

I talked to my boyfriend after he got home from work and things actually went better than expected. I told him that I did not under any circumstance want to have sex with another man because I didn't have any desire to do so and never would. I told him it was very hurtful to me that he would keep pressing me to do something that I clearly didn't want to do

After talking about it for a little while, so I asked him if he knew anyone else who had his same fantasy and he said no, and I asked if he knew what the word for it was and he said no. So I told him that I had done a little research on it and found out that it's a thing with a name that a lot of people like, and that seemed to comfort him a little, although he also asked some questions after that implying that maybe since I had done research on it I would be more inclined to try it. I told him again firmly that I am not going to do it and said to stop trying to twist things around so that I sound like I will do it because that's manipulative and it makes me feel shitty.

I was planning to tell him to never talk to me about it again, and make him feel worse, so I told him that I loved him no matter what and I'd try to be there for him, but I couldn't be there for him if he kept trying to get me to try it or thinking that there was a chance of me trying it, so that needed to stop. Then the conversation was getting a little intense so we took a bit of a break; he made some food and I went on Reddit for a little while.

And then when we had cooled our heads a bit I asked him if he maybe had any other fantasies that would make him feel something like what he wanted from the cuckold thing that just involved him and me. He said there were a couple things he wanted to try but was too afraid/ashamed to ask, but he said he was truly sorry for being so pushy and that he didn't want to push me away. 

So that's pretty much where we stand right now. I will look up subreddits later this week for some of the new stuff he wants to try (basically me being really assertive and pretending to be mean to him, but I am actually pretty sure that we can work this out? I'm holding out hope at least that I'll like this new stuff and he'll like it just as much and it'll make the cuckolding not feel so critical to his satisfaction with our sex life. So yeah, that's basically the gist of it. I will post another update when something new happens but for now I appreciate all the advice that you guys gave me.

I (25) and my fiancee (26) have been together for 8 years. We've had a fantastic and healthy relationship; communication has been easy and we're crazy about each other. Our wedding is 6 months away.

My fiancee's father is currently in the hospital, she is having a tough time. I've tried to be there for her, and I've done everything I can, but I'm terrible with emotional stuff. 

We scrounged together enough money to go to her parent's house. We're currently staying there along with her brother, so there's plenty of room.

Last night, but my fiancee told me not to. Not too long later, I heard some banging noises and more screaming from the wife. My fiancee again told me to just ignore it, but I got up to go see what was going on. 

He was beating his wife. It was quite savage, and and she was curled up in a corner. I ran in and pulled him off of her and tried to see how much medical attention she needed. The husband didn't like this too much, so he and I started yelling at each other, at which point my fiancee runs in and tries to separate us. He then threw the first punch and I proceeded to whup his ass, but I cut up my hand badly in the process. 

My fiancee's brother gets up and my fiancee follows him to wherever he went. I try to call the police, I don't call. I wrap up my hand and make sure she's okay (she wasn't too injured. A few bruises and bloody nose, but nothing major.)

My fiancee then comes back in and yells at ME. She told me I was a shitty person for attacking her brother and abandoning her and how she never wants to see me again. She runs and throws everything I had in the house outside (my suitcase, wallet, and keys). I tell her to calm down, but she literally pushes me outside. I'm not going to fight with her at this point, so I leave and go stay at a hotel.

She hasn't answered any calls since. What the fuck happened? She has never acted this crazy before. I know she's going through a lot now, she can't even afford her half by herself. Am I wrong for thinking about canceling her return ticket? Her sister in law isn't answering any calls either, nor is her mother. Am I being too extreme with anything?

tl;dr: My fiancee kicked me out for getting into a fight with her brother.

1330100258.0,q46q2,UPDATE: Boyfriend actually *did* rape someone.,neologismo,348,80,359,"Original thread: http://redd.it/q1noh

Well, without censoring anything. So, here we go. 

Just a brief summary

The new stuff:

I get an email, that detailed exactly what happened re: the alleged rape. It was incredibly detailed, and featured some things that were clearly true and about my boyfriend (like scars that he has, etc) so I knew it wasn't just a rumor anymore. So I confronted my boyfriend, and he admitted that he did it, and it happened about 5 years ago.

So

1) I was told in a really drama-laden way that my boyfriend raped someone.

2) He denied it.

3) I made a reddit thread asking what people thought

4) The girl then emailed either my Roommate or Mutual Anonymous friend, so take that for what it is. ALSO ANOTHER EDIT: Since I without really thinking posted some details about the situation down there a lot of people have gotten confused about it all, so I will just give the briefest summary of the rape: They had a fight, they made up, he wanted to have make-up sex, she didn't, but he had sex with her anyway, yes, kinda ambiguous but whatever

5) I confronted him

So, he should be honest about it with her so that she doesn't have to find out this way. I guess I'm kind of in shock right now, but you know that ambiguous feeling that's at the end of relationships, that ""did I do the right thing?"" Yeah, I don't really have that feeling. I feel pretty certain I did do the right thing. I'm looking forward to just getting on with my life without him in it.

**EDIT: Since this is probably relevant information, after discussing it with friends I realize the warning signs were there. There was never anything that in itself was so inexcusable, it was just a pattern of things that, taken together, I should have noticed, but I was too busy being a dumbass/in love/whatever. It's more like a pattern of thinking that perhaps he is owed something, or that he is entitled to things he really isn't, he's also VERY sweet and loving a lot of the time. Also I'm 100% sure he's reading this thread, because I don't want to contact him but HEY YOU : DO NOT CONTACT ME

**TL;DR: Sometimes people aren't who you think they are

**EDIT: For all interested


*FINAL EDIT: Just wanted to say a huge thank you to all the people who were so supportive of my decision and said such kind words to me in this thread and through messages. I tried to thank everyone personally, but the things you said really made me feel better about what I think is the most painful relationship situation I've ever been through. It called so many things into doubt for me, but the worst was my own judgment. Thanks for taking the time to type a few comforting words. It really made a difference in this anonymous internet woman's life. I realize that he will likely never apologize (or even acknowledge how horrible his actions were) to me, her, or any of the other women he harmed, so I will have to find closure on my own.

He is very smart, and is about to go into the magnet school that I'm currently attending. My dad has been in and out of work, and was laid off about a year ago, and recently found a job about 3 months ago. He has to go on business trips often, and they usually last for about a week or so. He works in TV

My mother is a stay at home worker

My brother has been screaming at us since he was 3 years old. He has had multiple problems with doing things that normal children should have stopped doing years ago, it would be a great help. He is incredibly smart, and is going to go into a magnet school that I currently attend. He is sweet, but he can switch emotions on a dime.

The way he is acting is terrible. He plays video games for hours a day, but trust me, that's not all. If anything doesn't go his way, he screams about it. It doesn't seem like much of a problem, but it's the fact that he won't back down. Nothing my parents do seems to work, if he is yelled at, he yells back. He thinks that everyone has to be treated equally

He only acts like this at home. At school, and sometimes it ends up being disrespectful. 

We would try to get him some psychiatric help

My mom cries a lot when my brother screams at her. She used to be bullied as a child

tl;dr: My 7 year old brother is seperating my family with how he acts

So my problems with him are:
-He's a pervert, these aren't private messages, these are comments that everyone can see. My sister has been dealing with self esteem issues because of this. He sees nothing wrong with what he does. 

-He was kicked out the military due to a DUI

-He's a pervert. Last weekend, and before leaving he asked if I wanted to take my phone with me, and I said no, it needs to charge. I don't lock my phone, because I'm never in a situation where it NEEDS to be locked. When I came back to the house, my gallery was opened, and in my sent emails

I did not expect to get so many and varied responses to my problem. It seems that many people and many relationships have a difficult time balancing how much involvement family has. I learned a lot about the other side of the issue

My wife and I spoke last night

**Near term:** we compromised

**Long Term:** I'm going to take the pressure off of her attending family events. School is stressful, she will make an honest effort to see my side of the family. We will both make an effort to understand the importance of those close to us: I will try and view her close friends as her family, and she will try and understand that my family means as much to me as her close friends do to her. (ie. her old roomate coming to town for 1 night only is important. My uncle coming to town for one night only is also important. Overly simplistic, but that's the idea.)

I'm also going to set the expectation with my family that she's going to be busy, and not up for debate. I am going to go to more functions alone, and she's going to be supportive of that.

**Longer Term:** we discussed a rotating holiday schedule

**Note:** I want to say how much the comments helped me. Reading how strongly people feel about this issue gave me a new respect for the gravity of it. It was much easier to be understanding

I've always been honest with my partners about the number of men I've slept with. However, and it was frequently a source of tension. I'm now in a new relationship, and we haven't discussed numbers. I'm considering just outright lying to him, saying it's something around 30. It makes me both sad and frustrated that I need to lie about my past and who I am in order for a man to accept me. If I tell him the real number, and he thinks less of me, I can't take it back. 

It seems like a ridiculous catch-22: men want their partners to revel in sex and to be unashamed of their bodies and desires, but, let's be realistic: double-standards for men and women are very well-ingrained in people, and women are still tacitly judged by their sexuality.

I am using a throwaway because my wife likes to use my reddit account.  My wife and I have been married for the past two years.  Our relationship has always been good but with the typical relationship ebbs and flows.  We are both very trusting and generally give each other a rather long leash when it comes to trust.  My wife and I like have fun and go out and drink

Over the weekend my wife went to a college friends wedding out of town.  I stayed home for various reasons that just made it not really possible for me to go with her.  As I stated my wife likes to have fun and can get flirty with other guys but nothing crazy that would ever worry me.  Mostly it consist of dancing with a bunch of other guys because I just don't really dance to white guy awkwardness.  Well while partying it up on the nights before and of the wedding one of the groomsmen, my wife is attractive and it happens and I know the girls she is party with who would not let this happen.  After he made this clear she made sure to never be alone with him to avoid any sort of situation that my arise.  I generally believe this.

I pick up my wife from the airport yesterday and she tells me about all the fun she had and then she starts talking about Steve.  She tells me about how she proceeded to play wingman for two of the bridesmaids ( There are five bridesmaids and three are married

While my wife hid nothing from me some of the other messages between the two of them bothered me.  When Steve would relay some of his sexual conquest with the other bridesmaids she would reply with, what can she.  Also when she was waiting at the airport he texted her, ""Hey if our flights get delayed why don't you just let me slip it.""  Again, haha sure that is hot, this is making me wet, etc ...  Towards the end my wife summed it with stuff along the lines of, ""Hey this was fun, you should be proud.""  Steve replied back with

I told me wife that I do trust her and honestly don't believe anything happened but I feel some of the exchanges were inappropriate for a married woman.  She agreed and said it was.  I'm not worried about anything happening beyond this because Steve lives almost literally on the other side of the country.  She let me know through out the weekend how she missed me wished I was there because she was jealous everyone was getting sex but her and that she is looking forward to coming home.  She came home and our typical good sex ensued

This whole ordeal is just consuming me on the inside though.  I don't know if I am handling this correctly or how to really even handle this.  This probably stems from insecurity of two things.  First, and generally accept, she is out of my league and this Steve character is far better looking than me ( think Christian Bale in American Psycho build ).  What should I do?  Am I wrong in these feelings or is this just insecurities bubbling to the surface?  I don't even know how to approach this beyond what we have already discussed.  She has reassured me nothing has happened but I just can't let go of the though that she might be lying.

TL;DR 

Wife can be a bit of a tease at times.  She is out of town for a wedding.  Groomsmen seems to have taken a shinning to her.  A few inappropriate text messages were exchange.  Insecurities are consuming me over this.

[EDIT]

My wife called me and asked if I would like to get lunch with her.  I declined and she picked up very quickly that something wasn't right and I think she knows whats up.  I am at work ( obviously getting a lot done ) so I cant talk to her on the phone about this and I don't feel talking about this over a brief lunch is appropriate.

I ask though would it be appropriate to link her to this thread with a, my friends are all jackasses and I really have no one to talk to about this to help flesh out what is in my head.

I invited her to look over this thread.

[EDIT3]

She has responded to my email inviting her to read over this and what not.  She reiterated that she knows she was wrong and she regrets doing it.

What bothers me in this is no apology and the word ""regret.""  Regrets are for liars and cheats who got caught

Email for the curious:

I totally understand. I thought you might discuss this with your web friends. I am sure there are plenty of ""yeah, then she didn't"".  I am aware that I put myself in a shitty position and said things to him that I should not have, and I regret that.

I guess we are what some consider to be quite sexually liberal but in no way do either of us want an open relationship.  If she does it has not come up in 10 years and considering the stuff that has come up about what we want sexually I would be surprised that if she does she hasn't mentioned it yet.

Well

She walked up wearing a really short black dress, fuck. It's a dude in a dress.

I was stunned. She kept talking and then a bit of doubt crept in. We went for a little walk and I just kept studying her. I have never been so thoroughly confused. Her voice is kind of right there on the edge of a really low female voice and a high female impersonator voice. Can't spot her adam's apple. Her hands are kind of large but smaller and more slender than most men. Kind of normal sized shoulders. Long very shapely legs. Medium sized feet. Her face is kind of larger and more robust

Since I had no idea what to do, it makes you look her over again and start asking questions. The people at the tables next to us kept glancing over. The waiters all took turns bringing us food.

She seemed to be completely oblivious to everything and we just had a really nice chat and I kind of enjoyed myself. She was pretty flirty, had a great sense of humor, and I was just having an out of body experience the whole time.

She texted me after she got home, her every picture, and found absolutely nothing that answered any questions. Simple gender-neutral office job. No pictures of when she was younger, but then who puts up baby pictures on a dating site?

She was either a good looking tall girl with a slightly masculine voice

She texted me a couple of days later and asked if I wanted another date, to each his own, and that kind of went nowhere.

That was yesterday. That date ended with a hug, I'd be hella attracted to her. 

I can't very well flat out ask her if she was born a female. I really want to avoid a Crying Game scenario and I just go exploring her anatomy. Besides

I'd like to know for sure if she's a girl before a third date

[Update #1]( http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jgjal/update_i_17f_need_advice_on_what_to_do_after_a/)

**Update #1 TL;DR:**   I talked with the father and let him know that I’m pregnant. He’s being super supportive and we are waiting to talk to doctors to make an informed decision about what to do.


**Update #2:**

Sorry for the wall of text.  I have a lot to say and am bad at being clear and concise.  

First off, not good, but not as horrible as I had been thinking (Class B Felony is up to 60 years).  Prosecution depends solely on my parents.  I am hoping they won’t go after him and if they do I will try to protect his identity and make sure he doesn’t get in trouble.  

Secondly, emotional state, and so on).  He didn’t pry too much for the father’s identity and I don’t think he’s going to report anything to the state.  He gave me a bunch of pamphlets and reading materials to look through and then we talked briefly about my options and what I wanted to do.  He tested me for STIs (will get the results next week) but warned that it can take months to test positive after being infected.  I talked to the father and he agreed to get tested too just to be safe. I had a second appointment yesterday with a counselor.  We talked about a lot of the same things that I did with the doctor but I felt much more relaxed with her.  She was super nice and helpful and I plan to continue meeting with her.  Finally I had my appointment today at planned parenthood.  I went through the same procedure that I did with the campus doctor (less the STI test) but she went a lot more in depth about my options.  She did an ultrasound (which by the way is not on the stomach like they show in movies) and we discovered I’m having twins.  I was shocked.  I know it doesn’t really change anything but in my mind everything became twice as serious once I found out there are two babies.  

Third, but either way I think it’s wrong.  I sympathize with the girls that need abortions and don’t judge them for their choices but it’s not something I could do.  I know if I got an abortion I would never be able to forgive myself and I would not be able to move on with life.  I ultimately decided on adoption because while I don’t think it’s fair for me to deny the babies the right to life, I know I’m not ready to be a mom.  Even if the father or my parents were to support me financially I don’t think I’m ready to raise one baby let alone two. By giving them up for adoption they’ll have a chance to live a full life with a loving family.  I’d also be helping out a couple by giving them the babies they so desperately want. I know giving them away will be difficult; after the ultrasound I already feel attached to them.  However, I know it’s what’s best and with an open adoption I’d be able to watch them grow and flourish with a new family. The father completely supports my choice and we’ve already started researching online and looking at couples.  Like me, the father wants an open adoption so we have the option to see the babies and know how they are. We also think an open adoption (versus a closed) would be best for the babies because we would be able to explain when they are older that we gave them up so they could have a better life not because we didn’t love them. The father and are going to continue researching adoption on our own and we have a meeting with a counselor next week to help walk us through the process.  We plan to wait another week or two to tell my parents just so we have more time to figure everything out without them freaking out.  I know bringing the babies to term will definitely change my life (and not necessarily in a good way).  I am going to have to take spring semester off but I’m not too worried about that.  Age wise I was already a year ahead in school and on top of that I came in with a lot of credits and now my summer classes.  Despite a semester set back I would still be able to continue and graduate college in a timely manner.  

Finally, and in whatever other way he can. Over the past three days we have spent countless hours talking and getting to know each other.  The more time I spend with him, the more I like him.  He is compassionate, caring, funny, and by far one of the best people I have ever met.  We had a class together last semester and I spent most of the semester crushing on him based purely on his looks and the witty comments he’d make.  We never really talked much and I assumed he didn’t even know I existed. But when I saw him at the party he remembered me and we got a chance to talk and really hit it off.  The night of was great but the next morning I woke up embarrassed and ashamed.  I snuck away, assuming that he was just using me for sex. Now however it seems like he really does like me.  At least I think he does.  I’m super confused/torn and don’t know what I feel let alone how he is really feeling. I can’t tell if I really like him or am just relieved that he’s not a total asshole. Do I really like him or am I just convincing myself that I do because it makes this whole situation easier?  And as far as what he really feels

1373240630.0,1htvx9,Update. My husband [36] walked out on me [33] on Monday after 13 years and I don't know what to do.,distressedwife,331,76,65,"I posted about this


http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1dq1x9/another_update_my_husband_36_walked_out_on_me_33/

My husband rented a flat in the village and lives a few minutes away from us. For a while things were ok, still, but as I started obviously getting better, he started getting worse.

 He started being really mean, took off his wedding ring, generally acting completely out of character.  It wasn't until I said, ok, let's just be friends, that we started getting on really well again. Things were going great for a while, just being friends, and we planned on keeping things as normal as possible, which he doesn't like. It was really sweet, he said ""I know."" Things were going really well and between things like the songs and just chatting and having a few beers

Then two weeks ago I found out about his girlfriend. He met her online, and they've never met in person. He swears that him leaving me and our children is unrelated to his relationship with this woman, and he's convinced it's a good idea. We live in Northern Ireland, she lives in Belgium. She's 2 years younger than me (I'm 34 now), she has a child of her own, and she sent him the money for him to go meet her. He's going to London to meet her tomorrow. I guess it's about halfway for both of them.

The whole situation is very bizarre. I had my suspicions about him seeing someone else, I'm so calm lately, I don't recognise myself. I wasn't angry with him, just disappointed. SO things kept going great with us till he decided he couldn't be around me anymore. He can't handle me being nice to him, or being friends with me. It's too hard for him. It's hard for me too, and since he's changing his mind so often about us, I've pretty much cut him off. I've seen him twice in the past two weeks

I apologise for how rambling this all seems, it's the only way for me to get better and move on with things. And it's true, I've felt great this past week or two without contact, much less pressure. I have my gorgeous children and our lovely home and fabulous friends. I also have my family and my husbands family. They're all shocked and disgusted at his behaviour, not least because he had all of them and me, convinced that this whole thing was my fault. I don't know what's going to happen in the future, but at least now he's going to finally meet this woman

Edit: Thank you everyone for your lovely comments and advice. As for the one or two ridiculous comments about me being a terrible wife, and got help for it as soon as I found out. But the fact is my husband and I had a great relationship, lots of fun and laughs and we still get on great. As I've found out recently there are plenty of idiots in the world, but I have wonderful friends and family who make that kind of fool easier to tolerate.

My girlfriend [24f] and I [28m] have been in a relationship for over 6 years, but I digress).

At any rate

My girlfriend was quite the anti-gamer back in the day

We'd play well into the night most days, particularly in Europe.

Which would have been fine and dandy. I have no problem with her making friends on the Internet and finding a hobby to pour her spare time into. After all

But then I come home early from work one day and discover one of her clan mates calling her ""babe"" and sending her kiss emoticons. I confront her about it, but I again digress).

Then came the increasingly odd and secretive behavior on her part. Whereas she used to share memes and content she'd find on the Internet with me on a regular basis

So I wrote a keylogger, until a recent episode two days that once again flared my suspicions. 

I just finishing scouring the logs literally 5 minutes ago and discovered she's had cam sex with this guy once in the last few months. I also discovered several instances where they had chat sex but she refused to turn on her cam because her ""brother is at the computer behind her"".

Because of conflicting schedules and timezones issues (we're in Asia, but she now has 2 more potential replacements in the pipes. 

I've also discovered that she has edited me out of her life as far as her ""real"" online profiles are concerned. Her official profiles show the typical info - In a relationship with me,. but her ""real"" online profiles show no trace of a boyfriend, and contain references to the ""brother"" she shares her apartment with. Note that we've been living together for about as long as we've been together. 

Needless to say, I technically violated her privacy - which I'm sure is something she will likely bring up (in a fit of outrage, mind you) if and when I do decide to confront her.

How would you confront her if you were in my shoes? Can anyone give me any advice? Is a relationship like mine worth saving

My brain sort of already knows the answer to that last question

**I keylogged my girlfriend of 6 years and discovered she's lied to my face and had cam sex with her Russian clan mates. Do you think this relationship is worth saving? If not

So he finally called me back and I asked him what he did today and, really? that's interesting because I know you're lying about where you were and who you were with. He apologized profusely for lying and gave his explanation that he was just letting a friend crash on his couch and nothing happened. (And of course later on in the conversation he revealed that they did make out a little.)

I told him I felt it was best we not see each other anymore. He kept repeating that I was throwing everything away over a stupid mistake he made. He said how much he regretted it and it meant nothing and he wished he hadn't done it and that I was also in the wrong for testing him. (Apparently letting him do what he did was testing him because I wanted to see what he would do.) He said he loved me for the first time and how much I meant to him and that he wanted to fight for me

It doesn't matter to me now if it was a one time thing and he regrets his mistake and it doesn't matter if he's been lying to me the whole time. Because he never wanted to be official all I had to hold onto and reconcile myself with was the fact that we agreed to always be open and honest with each other

I don't regret the relationship

- Ages: 33M &amp; 30F

- Married for 5 years

Two weeks ago my wife went to visit one of her old college friends. Apparently they went out together and she gets blasted and goes home with some guy. My wife says no penetrative sex happened and they just hooked up (i.e. making out/oral). I'm not sure I believe this but it really doesn't make too much of a difference. She cheated. I noticed something was off with her because she seemed so depressed and clingy from the second she got back. Friday she starts crying and tells me that she cheated on me and she is so sorry and it won't ever happen again. She is promising me everything and just crucifying herself. 

I'm basically the typical nice guy. I've never cheated on my wife and I think I've been a good husband. I don't really think I deserve to be cheated on. Our marriage wasn't that great to begin with so I'm not sure what we would be saving. We were arguing all the time before this. We weren't having regular sex. I'm not even sure I am in love with her. And now add in cheating. 

I know my wife and I can believe her getting drunk and something happening. I don't think she is lying about anything. This woman is a complete lightweight. Anything after 4 drinks and she is just out of it and not the same woman. I don't think she intentionally sought to cheat on me and I do believe she is truly guilty. 

Thing is right now I'm seeing this as my card out of this terrible marriage while still looking like the good guy. Am I being selfish. We don't have kids (I do want them though). 

I guess what I'm asking here is

""Am I wrong to see her cheating as an out and do I have to try to reconcile

AND

I'm looking for advice on how to tell her I want a divorce. I'm not sure if I should play it nice and just say its both of us (probably smarter) or just crush her and say its because she cheated on me (which would be more satisfying). 

**EDIT 10PM**

Sorry for not responding to all of these comments. I stepped away for a bit to talk to my wife. I wanted to get a feel for how she was feeling and I told her that we probably were over. I know a lot of you guys told me to talk to an attorney but there really isn't much at stake. We don't have kids. We rent a place together and our lease is up Oct 31 so there isn't even a house. We both make the same money (roughly) and my wife is a pretty decent person

I explained how I haven't been happy for a long time and how her cheating just made it clear to me I couldn't deal any longer. We had enough problems without cheating. Its too much to handle. 

She starts to freak the fuck out at this point. Its pure theatrics. Basically she insists she never

We keep up this argument for a bit and I just tell her it doesn't matter. You betrayed me. I don't care if you blew him or fucked him or *just* kissed him. You don't go home with other people when you are married. And she starts to weep. She literally was begging me to not divorce her that she would make it up to me anyway she could. At this point, so I ended up taking her to her parent's place a half hour away. I think its for the best we keep some space between us. I'm just wiped out emotionally. I kept my cool through all of it but it was intense. I think I'm making the right call here. There was no way I would ever trust her again. We had a bad marriage before the cheating. We don't and probably wouldn't ever have kids. There really wasn't any reason to stay and there wasn't anything to save.

In the past

I also am a social person, dinners, drink nights for a wide friend circle.  Usually this is a group event when I plan it; but for dinner or lunch it's often just one on one.

I figure that, if this is the case I'll just talk to my girlfriend when we get in the car.Then my girlfriend's brother [21] comes home and starts yelling at my girlfriend about some money he thinks she owes him. At this point she's on edge, so I figure the car drive home probably isn't the best time to bring it up. We get to my place, and after dinner, I bring her into my room, and sit her down on my bed. I can remember most of what I said. I tried my best to remain calm and clear-headed

""So I was over at your place on Monday, and then the topic of porn came up. And in doing so, there was something in particular you said that bothered me quite a bit. You said that you would never allow any guy you date to watch porn, right? And then you kind of forced it upon me to say that I wouldn't watch porn. And that really did bother me in a couple of ways. Firstly, because you're kind of telling me what I can or can't do with my own body, in my own time when I'm not with you. And I think that so long as what I'm doing in my own time isn't hurting you or having a negative effect on our relationship, then it isn't your place to tell me what I can or can't do. Like, but I felt like you were asserting some sort of dominance over me

(Obligatory break in wall of text)

""And secondly, every man on the planet has very strong sexual urges, and I'm no exception, especially at my age. Now, most guys in a relationship would be able to satisfy those urges through sex. Since we're not sexually active, I need to find a substitute for that, and I get that through watching porn. It's not that I find these girls more attractive than you, okay? I still love you more than anything in the world, and that's not healthy in a relationship.""

My girlfriend was looking at me through most of this, and I couldn't help but feel that she was still uncomfortable by the idea of me watching porn, so I decided to change the topic again.

""Look

She responded by telling me that she had a fairly sheltered upbringing, and that it was important to stay away from it. I asked her if she understood now why I would need it, and she replied with ""Yes, it actually makes sense to me now."" After this she also told me that she never intended for it to seem like she was controlling me. She tried her best to hold it back, but she ended up crying in my arms, hugging me tight and telling me that she would never want it to be that way. I reassured her that I knew she wouldn't do anything like that intentionally, and that it's important for us to always be open and honest with each other with any problems we might have.

When she had settled down, or sinful, but I was rather surprised to find out that she actually does want me in that way. She doesn't see any harm in the physical side of sex, but she feels like it's something worth saving for someone special. She gave an analogy about a bride and a groom about to be wed, and when the bride says ""I do"", seven other brides each approach the alter and say ""I do"" as well. When the first bride questions the groom about this, he responds with something along the lines of (don't quote me on this) ""I gave my heart away to many women before I met you

Now obviously, or something of the sort, however I now see that she values sex so highly that she believes a couple's first sexual encounter would be made even more special if it were at the climax of the relationship (pun kind of intended). I can respect that, but I asked her anyway, ""Are you sure this is something you've absolutely thought about? I wouldn't want us to be missing out on something like this if it's an issue you've only glanced over."" She told me that it was something she had been thinking of her entire life. She also told me not to get the wrong idea, that she does want me in that way and still reckons I'm the hottest guy on the planet, but thinks that something as special as sex should wait until marriage.

We had an awesome night watching funny video game reviews on Youtube.

My parents got divorced about two years, honestly; they absolutely did *not* get along.  My mom also came out as bisexual five years ago, which also caused a lot of friction (dad seemed to think “bisexual” meant “cheating on him”).  It took me a while—and I definitely said some things I'm ashamed of before I did—but I fully support and accept my mom's sexuality and I'm trying to do the right thing and be a more tolerant person.  

But there has to be a “but

*Buuuuuuut* … a little before I came home for Winter Break, it's all well and good to accept that your mom is bi, but when you're a socially-awkward penguin straight girl and meeting your mom's new *girlfriend* for the first time, that's sitcom territory.

Then I met my mom's girlfriend.  Mom and her girlfriend picked me up at the airport.  I don't know exactly what I was expecting

Nope!  

She's 19!  A year younger than me!  My mom's banging a girl who graduated high school a year after I did!  I thought she was another girl coming home for Christmas

I should mention that my mom's girlfriend (let's just call her Tina from now on) is a fine person (cheerful, obsessed with her BeDazzler, etc.) and it shouldn't be my business what my mom and Tina do with their lives.  But it still weirds me the *hell* out.  I have no problem with my mom being bi, but I do have a lot of problems with her specific choice of *Tina* as a girlfriend:

* The age thing.  She's a year younger than me.  There were definitely times, and … no, just no.

* The size difference.  I haven't mentioned it yet, about 5'10.  Tina, on the other hand, is 5'1 and maybe a buck even (100 lbs.).  Coupled with the age difference (guh!), it really does look like my mom is dating a child, not someone who's legally an adult.  And Tina dresses really “young,” too

* Flirting and PDAs.  If it hadn't been for the first two issues, they were clearly holding themselves back when I was around or they thought I couldn't hear, so I have to thank them for that.  But still, watching my mom kiss a girl younger than me was deeply disturbing.  And hearing them call each other “baby” was just plain weird. And I * definitely * heard them have sex … and more than once.  

* And when Tina sat on my mom's lap one night … there is not enough brain bleach in the world.

* Their friends.  I know my mom has talked about “letting myself go” and “experimenting” since the divorce, and * that's * good, too.  I even met a couple of them over the break.  And they are … interesting people, let's say.  There was a definite “alternative lifestyle” vibe going on, and I could definitely pick up a few … “shared experiences” between them and Tina and my mom.  Again, brain bleach. There is not enough.

So … there.  I'm glad I got that off my chest at least.  This is an incredibly awkward situation all around, and part of it is thinking about my mom having sex with a girl not just my age, but *younger*.  And possibly with other people.  

How do I get over how creeped out I am by all this?  Am I too creeped out by this?  Not enough?  Just right?  Should I tell my mom she's sharing way too much, I don't think.

Since then things have been really, and we spend probably 2 or 3 nights a week together. Text each other every night we aren't together. He took care of me when I was sick a couple weeks ago. I've fallen for him hard, and I thought he felt the sameway about me. 

I went home on Thursday for Summer Break and we are going to be about 4 hours apart. We were making plans to see each other over the summer, and the relationship was okay.

1364175196.0,1ay46h,An apologyletter to my neighbour[~25m],iSoder,306,61,58,"Hi!

I have a problem with my neighbour with the twist that I'm the bad guy

Wall-of-text backstory: Last christmas I got a new sound system from my parents. As I listen to alot of music / tv-shows I used this frequently when I moved back to my place. I live in an middle floor in an apartment complex of three floors. 

Maybe a week after I moved back from the holidays I got a call from my landlord telling me he have received calls about noise from my apartment - which sounded like I was moving furniture all night. 

I was thoroughly confused as I certainly wasn't moving any furniture and I didn't connect the dots here (as I always make sure to have a low volume at night). 

After the call I made extra sure that I kept a low volume - even testing how much could be heard from the other room and outside the door (which was none as soon as I left the room with a medium-loud setting). 

I got a visit from the neighbourhood security a few days ago (their main function is to keep an eye on student parties) we had a chat about it and he suggested that it might be a sound system as he had alot of similar cases before. 

I'm now convinced it is the soundsystem and I have taken measures to reduce / nullify the noise.

Since we are a few months from christmas I can't imagine the frustration my neighbour must've felt - even though I tried to I wasn't successful until now (hopefully). 

I wrote this apologyletter and have yet to send it

(English isn't my native language so it's translated)


&gt; ""Hello
&gt; 
&gt; As you may know I am the one who lives in the apartment directly  above you. I've aware that you have experienced loud noise from me for quite some time now. 
&gt; 
&gt; I've tried to keep the noise down by playing at low volumes in the evening and at night but since they haven't been enough I've been confused as to what was the cause of the noise. 

&gt; I've now identfied the source as the subwoofer I got last christmas.  It has been standing directly on the floor - obviously a stupid idea as  it caused the vibrations that you've heard until now. 

&gt; I've now moved the subwoofer into a bookshelf with a dampening cloth underneath - a temporary solution until I receive a soundcanceling platform designed for subwoofers. 

&gt; Now that I'm aware of the source of the problems I hope you can accept my sincerest apologies. As an added measure you'll find two giftcards for movies tickets attached to this letter. 

&gt; Feel free to contact me at my [cellphone number] should these preventive measures fail. If you experience any other noise please contact me immediately so I can easily identify what is causing the problem - and we both avoid further frustration. 
 
So what are your thoughts on this letter? Is there anything else I can / should do?

edit: To be clear I'm 99% sure the problem isn't bass *sound* but rather the *vibration* it makes - and as it was standing on the floor the vibration was sent directly down to my poor neighbour. 

**TL;DR** My (25y) subwoofer has caused my downstairs neighbour (~25y) to hear the vibrations comming off it even at low volumes since last christmas without me knowing about it. I've written an apologyletter which I want a few pointers at as well as other tips on handling my angry neighbour. 

**update** First of all thank you all for the positive feedback! I'm more confident in sending this letter now! I wrote this last night and went to bed right after so this was a good way to start the day. I was afraid it would be tacky to send a letter or that my gesture with the gift would be too much but you seems to like to so I'm going with it.

Some of you pointed out that there's no making up for months of noise but I firmly believe that one should at least try to make amends when one has wronged this much. It's up to him to accept the apology - I don't need to be best friends with him

When I had posted the original thread, wasn't considering an abortion and she had previously told me she was pro-Life so I knew I shouldn't bring it up, but I couldn't reconcile my feelings. 

This baby is part of me, and I told her I was so sorry for not being more involved and I told her that I was scared, but I knew what we have to do. That I love her, and that I want to be there for her and our baby. 

She was relieved, and while marriage isn't in the immediate cards, it will happen sooner than later. She loves my children, and they care for her so much and I know she will be a good mother to them. She wants to too, and I think this is in a way the best possible thing that could happen for all of us. I am so beyond lucky to have her in my life, and so are my children. We are a family now, all of us. 

I struggled with feeling like I was moving on too fast after my wife passed and I still struggle with the rapid pace, and it is what it is. Its fast. But I do think when I'm with Caroline I'm putting my children first, and she helps me be a better man and a better father.

She was immediately brought to tears and we simply laid down together so she could process it as well and calm down.  I didn't say much as I didn't believe there was anything I could say to make the situation any better and instead just tried to comfort her as best I could.

In just a very short time

Last Saturday, so I stopped talking to her that day to calm myself down. The last text I got from her that day said, ""My parents know now"". I replied to that message, but she never messaged me back after that.

Sunday, it turns out it was her parents on the phone. They called to tell me that they already know what happened. They also told me that their daughter ran away from home and they have no idea where she is. They have already contacted her friends, but none of them knew where she is. Eventually, I found out from one of her friends that she went to her aunt's friend's house, so I was at ease.

I met up with her friends that night because they were worried as well. They also wanted to talk to me about what has been happening since the incident started. We've found out a lot of inconsistencies on what my girlfriend has been telling us.

The first and most important fact of all, everyone knew about that guy except me. Even her friends thought that I know the existence of that guy.

After finding out about that

* Last April

* When she got the ultrasound

* When she ran away from home

* She has been avoiding contact with me even until now because my sister told her that she's been suspecting that there really is another guy and that the baby isn't mine.

Anyway

To be honest, she also deleted me from Facebook. I asked her friends why she doesn't want to talk to me, and they told me that she said she isn't ready to talk to me. At this point, I just want to know what is wrong with me for her to cheat on me. I want to know what to change about myself, so this won't happen to me again.

So yeah, but I'm seriously broken hearted right now. Anyway, if you've been reading my previous posts and are still reading it right now, I want to thank you for reading what I have to say and having a share of my experience as well. I feel better knowing that there are random strangers on the Internet who give a damn about my situation.

**Edit**: I never suspected her of cheating during our relationship. Her friends have been calling me out because I was allowing her to go out all the time and I never stopped her even once.

1. Left her a note before going to work while she was sleeping (works nights @ hospital).  Moved into a friend's place.  Note explained that I found the texts she had with L, 6/30/13) to talk about how to tell our parents and what to do with our living situation - reminder: we were half way through a 2 year lease.

2.  Rough week @ work

3. Meet up with intention to talk about how we will tell our families and friends and it was **traumatic**.  Loud sobs, almost stubbornly and mindlessly, repeat ""It's too late."" to every attempt/suggest that I at least think about it.  I'm not sure if I made a mistake, but I know I can never forget what happened. 

4. We end up calling our relative families.  Her dad sounds incredibly disappointed in her.  My mother sounds almost giddy (they didn't get along too well).  My father is overseas and sounds grim.  We are officially done. Set another face to face a week from now to work out logistics - just getting the phone calls out were enough emotional strain for the day.

I am haunted by her desperation.  There were a lot of tears from her and a little from myself.  Heavy

I can't shake her frantic scramble to exhume the ring she bought for me and show me after I repeatedly refused her.  Or the time she snatched my phone from my hand and ran into the bathroom to try to get me not to leave (she is only in there for a minute, I still care very deeply for her and it is destroying me to had seen her writhe.

Last Saturday, and expand.  I excitedly told him my preliminary plans, and his response was, ""Ah, yeah, great.""  I asked him what he thought about various things and he didn't really respond, and then when I asked him what he thought about the office space and what I should look for, ""Why are you asking me?  I'm not a businessman.  You figure it out.""  My heart broke in two right then and there.  I was asking my husband to listen and support me with something that is not only really important to me but also to our family, and when I pursued the conversation

Yesterday solidified it all when my 13 year old daughter came inside and handed me a grocery bag with a box of chocolates.  She had walked two miles to the store and bought them for me for Mother's Day.  I thought about how much she must have struggled with wanting to get me something and not knowing how to do it

I have tried for 14 years.  I've made every excuse I can think of for his behavior.  I've blamed myself for everything.  But I'm not doing it anymore.  I deserve better!  Once I get out and settled and find myself again

My plan is to stay in the house until I can get my office and really get rolling.  My business is small group tutoring, and I have quite a few more people who are interested.  I think I can do this.  

But, I would talk to him, but it won't, and he clearly doesn't want to.  For the first time in 14 years, I'm ok with this.  I'm at peace...it's a quiet, sad kind of peace, but it's better than the alternative.

However, or any other divorce advice, I'm all ears!

**Original TL;DR:  GF [of now-3+ years] got pregnant even with an IUD in place. Risks to her make abortion the best option

---
This is a bit rambling and unfocused; I apologize in advance.  It's been a long

To start off with, and I still couldn't get beyond the pregnancy putting her at risk.  I'd love to tell you that we were sad for a couple days but got over it quickly, but that'd be a terrible lie.

The day after the abortion, as well as partially being blamed for a family member getting in trouble for molesting her.) Getting out of that environment helped her get to going months between harming incidents, but this triggered her.  She would cut almost daily, and at one point she cut ""I'm Sorry"" onto her abdomen.  She took 100% of the blame for the situation, even though I tried to tell her it was my/our decision and that I should at least get half of the blame.

I was a mess as well.  I knew that what she was going through was a possibility after the abortion and I still went with that decision.  I felt like a monster not only for the decision I made

I didn't talk to anyone about it at first.  Her insurance didn't cover mental health services, but I could never bring myself to press 'send.'  I tried to talk to my mom about it a few days after the abortion, leaving a message for her that said I had something important to discuss.  When she called back that night, I chickened out.  I talked about other things that bothered me (and there was a lot), but not what I just went through.  She couldn't bring herself to talk to her friends about it either.

A few weeks later (about one month after the abortion), and she felt the same way.  At the very least, we had someone to suffer with.

The weird part about all of this is that our relationship didn't feel strained.  Sure we were both miserable as hell, we never want to go through it again, and if we were faced with the same decision tomorrow, we'd probably choose differently.

The self-harming has... well, which is once every 4-6 months.

Fast forward to a few days ago.  She had a dream where she broke up with me and I responded nonchalantly.  It made her think about some things and wanted to make some changes in her life so that when we do get married (and it is now a question of when, together and/or separately.  I asked her if she was ready to talk about what we went through and she said yes.  I think I'm ready too.  We'll start seeking one out in earnest after Easter weekend.

There will be a brief TL;DR at the end

Basically
The age difference makes me uneasy to start with
The guy has a lot of history, has done a lot of drugs and was, well he still is, involved with a lot of gangs. Again, not my place to judge, but it just makes me feel wary that my mum is dating someone like this.

Anyway

We go round there, her boyfriend, the neighbours grandchild (They neighbours have gone out.) and some guy my mums boyfriend brought round, lets call him Tom, who was clearly high as fuck on something.

It was going fine, I didn't want to, it's fine, but he keeps insisting and shouting at the grandchild. This was kind of annoying me, he wasn't listening to what I was saying.


Anyway, still not listening, then telling me to stop being stupid. So I just say something to get him to shut up. I'm the one who answering the door, he gives me £20 to give to the man when he comes.

 Foods taking ages, the food comes when I'm checking on my dog, he pays for It with separate money, when I come back I give him the £20 back since it wasn't used, he insists I keep it, finally I just say okay, then he says ""Kiss on it?"" then comes over and tries to kiss me. Not like full on, but this makes me really uncomfortable.

I don't like my personal space invaded. My mother knows this and says nothing. He also said a couple of lewd things about my appearance. 

Well, although I am being myself. He then asks why I spend so much time by myself and asks why I don't come over here (My mum works a lot.). I just say how I don't mind spending time by myself, because I genuinely don't. I go to walk out the room then he grabs my wrist and pulls me back into the kitchen, telling my that's a load of rubbish. Invading my personal space again.

The neighbours come back and since it's now 12am, then starts yelling. My mum sees this as a sign to go home, so we do.

He knows he's upset us then knocks on our window, I do sound a bit selfish, but it's not nice when a parent doesn't stick up for you.


So, my mum calls me selfish then goes round my neighbours, leaving me on my own for the rest of the night. I assumed she'd be coming back. It's now 7am, and my neighbours lights are off, she's obviously staying round there, or gone round his, which is quite far away.

TL;DR: My mums new boyfriend makes me feel really uncomfortable, leaving me on my own.

Am I just being a spoiled, just mentally to me, and I just can't stand being around people like that. It brings back memories. 


Do I have a right to be upset?

I just think my mother deserves better.


I'd also like to add that my mothers new boyfriend has made quite a few racist and homophobic comments


EDIT: My mum finally came home at 15:30

 She also said that I need to stop dictating her life
I'm being too judgmental

Oh and apparently he can't be racist

Any advice on what to do now? 

What should I say to her? 

I can talk to my auntie



EDIT 2: So talking to her is pretty much useless

I don't know what to do anymore

I mentioned how I might want to go live somewhere else

My husband's birthday is in two weeks and I've been scouring through all of our pictures to make something really special for him. He has a couple external hardrives which I thought just had pictures and movies. I ran across some weird things while looking for pics of us. I wasn't even snooping. I ended up finding several folders of screenshots with my Husband (then boyfriend) talking to girls either on Chatroullette/Omegle and Skype. Hundreds of pictures. Literally over years. And most of the girls looked to be between like 15 and 18. Fucked up. 

I'm shaking at this point and I now start snooping legitimately. I guessed his email and fb passwords and I've been looking through all of his emails and messages. Dumb ass didn't delete anything. The picture I've been able to put together is he started talking to girls off these type of sites in 2009 and has been doing it consistently since then. There are like 4 girls he talks to regularly. One started when the girl was 15.... in his defense it doesn't seem like anything sexual is going on but its weird that he is basically best friends with a HS Freshman. Two are 18 now.... 16 or 17 when it started up. And another one is HS aged. I can't figure out her exact age though. She looks young. 

Basically he has been having cyber sex

I'm furious at him. I'm disgusted by him. This is so fucked up. We haven't even been married for that long and we've been trying to have a baby. And now this. He is basically a huge fraud. I don't know if I don't know him or if he changed or what. I haven't confronted him yet and don't know how to. Is there any way our marriage can survive this? I don't want to get divorced after less than a year Kardashian style but I really don't think I can look at him the same anymore. Any

I received a lot of great correspondenses. Some were encouraging while others were more protective over both my emotions and his, or not.  
At first, but then I saw this huge smile come across his face. He kissed me back and told me that he did in fact still feel the same way! He was just too chicken to say something sooner. I felt like a giddy little schoolgirl.  
We chatted for a little about us and about everything. Those of you who read my first post will know that his mom recently passed and that was the biggest reason why we broke up. I made sure he knew that I am there for him and that I understand why he pushed me away. He kept apologizing over and over for pushing me away and being all emo. We still have a lot of work

1351673956.0,12e2o1,"(37m) married for 15 years, was just told by my wife's therapist that she has never loved me.  Is one sided love enough?  Not sure what to do.",Soon2besingle,318,80,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/12e2o1/37m_married_for_15_years_was_just_told_by_my/

Just as a background, I've never been unemployed and earn enough that my wife has always had the option to stay home or work, I'm OK either way.  She's chosen to dabble in photography, write, help out at the kids school.. stuff like that.  I'm not the husband that's off at the bar after work or off playing golf every weekend.  I make sure her and I have a date night every 2 weeks and I try to make it special with dressing well and all that.  We have a great sex life, at least once a day she's interested and will make the first move if I don't.  I know this shouldn't matter but, she's amazingly pretty and I'm just your slightly below average looking guy.  I don't ditch all the house work on her although I admittedly do less than I probably should.  I work a lot but it's the nature of my career

So for 15 years we've been married and the first 12 I think were amazing.  After we had our first child she quit work and was a fantastic mom and with our second she was just the same.  Around year 12 though things changed.  She became depressed and withdrawn at times.   Her days consist of sleeping 12 hours, things were better for a while and then would start to slip again.  I encouraged her to take up some hobbies or start a small company so she dabbled in photography for a bit, started to write a book, things like that.  Still the depression lingered.  

After 3 years of her seeing a therapist he asked me to come have a coffee with him.  Odd, there is not.  Her realization that she never loved me is what has her depressed.  The therapist further explained that she's never really loved anyone.  She loves her kids in a nurturing way but she doesn't feel love the way most people typically do.   This all came as such a shock to me I had made sure we were talking about the same woman and he didn't get his case notes mixed up or something.

Further more

I really love her and I have never doubted it for even a moment.  I'm so much not an emotional type but when I look at her I can't help but think gooey romantic crap.  I love coming home to her, unfortunately, I know the truth.  Her depression is due to me.  When I look at her that's all I think at this point and while the sting will likely lessen I doubt it will ever completely leave my mind.

Options?
If I get a divorce I'll be seeing my kids a lot less and I love spending time with them.  Also there's the chance she'll remarry and that guy could be an asshole to them or worse yet.  By staying with her I guarantee my kids are raised well and are safe.  I'll have the opportunity to find someone that really loves me.  Then again I could find myself alone for the rest of my life or settling.

Staying together means I either have to shove this knowledge out of my head and continue to love her even though I know the truth.   I am worried now that she's cheated or actively cheats even though the therapist said she has never suggested to him that she has.  I could possibly end up completely resenting her

Finally

This sucks.

TL;DR: Wife's therapist told me she has never loved me and now do I stay or do I leave her?

**Update:** I seems pretty unanimous that this therapist is up to no good.  I talked with my brother and he believes the same thing.  The thought has crossed my mind as well seeing as he's roughly our age and not married.  I just have to decide how I'm going to go about this.  

I think I'm just going to talk to my wife and ask her to see a different therapist in an entirely different office.  Go with the whole, see her reaction, see if she then agrees with what he said and see what she wants to do.  I think, though, that playing this with a cool mind and just encouraging her to see someone a bit more professional is the way to go.  See how things pan out.   

I haven't fully decided what to do yet... and with Halloween and our neighborhood throwing a huge party I probably won't make that decision today.

So

And then I told him, I just wanted to get it over with and I didn't want to stress him out over something that was *way* outside of his realm of control, etc.

And he took it *really* well. I mean, so that probably helped with the pity angle. He just held me and we both cried for a bit and he said he's sorry I had to do it alone, he wishes he had been there. And then we got into a talk about his anxiety problems (they just started existing a couple of months ago) and he's decided he's going to try and get some therapy, because he doesn't want me having to hide this sort of stuff from him because he wants to be able to be there for me without his anxiety being a major factor - although I was *very* careful to say that I do not blame him, or his anxiety or anything at all - it's just a thing that happened the way it did, no one is really at fault.

Then we ordered some thai food and watched Netflix and cuddled.

I just can't seem to get romance down, just enjoy life by myself, and I will meet women naturally.  But I was doing that for the first 25 years of my life, with no girlfriends.  My entire life, I figured it was due to a lack of trying, of being happy alone.  But over a year and a half ago, I started trying to connect with women on a romantic level, and I choke.  Tried online dating, and *So Many* messages sent out...  Now I'm approaching my 27th birthday

I feel alone, tired of falling asleep alone in bed, and wanting to start a family.  Having never had a woman have any kind of romantic interest in me, I just feel hopeless.  I can't even fake being confident anymore.

Last night, he comes back and says he found what he was looking for: a sex toy. A few days earlier, he had brought up introducing sex toys to the bedroom and I was on board and enthusiastic. Of course, I kind of assumed we would be buying one. We were even joking about how gross it would be if tried to save money by searching through the bargain bin for a used one. 

When he mentioned using the toy he was already in possession of, but since I was actively trying to not think about the situation it kept popping up in mind and was met with waves of revulsion and anger.

I really just want to get a handle on my feelings. I'm not sure why I have such a strong visceral reaction to this and I'm not sure why it pisses me off that he would offer to use such an intimate object that was used in a (or several

I'll even reluctantly agree that I'm being childish to an extent. Lucky for me, I have an awesome boyfriend that loves and respects me.

I'm going to change names and a few details to try to protect identities. This is a throwaway but it's also my first post ever. 

I started dating my current girlfriend in September. She has always been very close to her parents. Her biological dad cut ties with her when she was a kid; her step-dad married her mom when she was around 4 and has basically been her dad; that is the person she considers her dad. I'll be referring to him as her dad for the rest of this post.

Again, and beyond she has generally chosen to stay home and spend time with them rather than go out and be with friends. She and her dad have been especially close. He has also been very protective of her. Only in the last year or so has she started to venture out on her own and experience things for herself. Around the time she started going out, drinking with other people, etc... her relationship with her dad started to deteriorate. When she started dating me, their relationship fell apart completely. 

Over the course of the next couple of months it came to a point where her dad was calling her a slut (even before we had sex or anything; she was a virgin), I was 90% sure he had feelings for her in some form even if he hadn't accepted it himself. This was reaffirmed when two different people that knew her and knew him said the same thing without me ever mentioning my suspicions. 

In the following weeks she and her parents had pretty much severed ties other than him occasionally texting her more terrible things

To save you all some reading we'll fast forward to tonight. After a little alcohol and a lot of tears, but tried to get things back to normal as best she could. But instead of trying to fix things or take anything back, her dad basically started treating her like crap because she didn't return his feelings. She was always far from being fat, but for a couple of years she was a little heavier than she is now (skinny now, about average or so the couple of years before that) and he would try to tell her that he loved her even when she was heavier, but I only liked her now that she's skinny; all kinds of things like that.

Apparently he finally told her mom about his feelings around August. She had always been jealous of their close relationship

There is one more thing she told me that she isn't sure if her mom knows or not. Earlier this year, this is all according to her dad; he even said she called him by my name) she told ""him"" (again calling him by my name) that it was ok to kiss her again. He did. She doesn't remember anything about it, but he said he didn't do anything beyond that, but he gave her a real kiss. Not a father-daughter type kiss. 

She feels humiliated and dirty and violated. I want to beat the crap out of this piece of shit more than I ever have anyone in my life. I know she still loves him as her father

What I told her tonight is that since he has made it clear that is the only kind of relationship that he wants with her that she has to cut ties with him completely

 I also told her to send her mom one last email. She may know everything, how much this fucked her up. If her mom still chooses to side with her dad, then she needs to cut her out of her life for good too.

Her extended family knows how good and awesome of a person she is and is completely siding with her in all this

Any advice? Anything I can tell her? I've told her a whole lot that none of this is her fault and it is all on him

TLDR: Girlfriend is treated like crap by her parents. Finally comes out that her dad is in love with her and calls her a slut because she doesn't want to be with him.

Writing this will be therapeutic for me

Backstory: I am a 21 year-old male who was in a 10 month long relationship with a 21 year-old female. We practically lived together and became one. There was much promise and talk of the future, my ex became despondent in our last few weeks of dating. She confessed that feelings for her ex had resurfaced, and so as not to hurt me further, she decided to be single. I should mention that she said she has no intention of returning to her ex (as it was an extremely damaging relationship), but she is clearly not giving her all right now to ours and needs to be single. Since this was not mutual, I was shattered. I didn’t understand what was going on, yet she remained adamant in her decision.
So

The breakup:
Regardless of who does this, but you need to take it for now. When my GF dumped me, she used examples that were hardly worthy of a breakup and all showed promise of being fixable. This was in addition to her own rationalization by saying that I deserve better because she hasn’t been treating me well in our relationship. The classic “it’s not you, it’s me.” (I see that she was right, now.) 

Your partner may become frustrated because you’re not understanding. They will say things that will damage you and look like they’re having fun in the process, they might even wear it for a few weeks or even months. When my ex dumped me, she went out and partied a ton, as I stood by and watched her on facebook, twitter and instagram. She posted tweets about “true love” which were likely referring to her ex (who also wants nothing to do with her now). In an age of instant &amp; constant connectivity, nothing but heartache awaits you on social media (See no contact rule below).

I would be surprised to learn that anyone who hasn’t been broken up with yet is reading this, or punch her straight in the mouth. Thankfully, neither of these things happened.

Truly, and make sure they are aware of what they’re doing. No combination of words is going to bring you back at this point. Even if it seems sudden, I promise that they’ve been contemplating this until they’ve reached a breaking point. You have every right to defend yourself, but do not become hot-headed and clumsy. Let this moment transpire with as much grace as possible. Don’t make them pity you because you still want to be with them. Let them go through with their decision. After all, if they cave and decide not to end things, it’s only a matter of time before they build up the strength to do it again. I convinced my ex that we were right for each other because I broke down and told her how much I love her and all the things I love about her. She agreed that we were fated to be together, and that she couldn’t hurt someone who loved her so much- she changed her mind about the “break” she suggested. Two unsettling days later

Post-breakup: The Unspeakable Pain

Your world has come crashing down. The emotional rug has been pulled out from underneath you and without closure. I drove home from being dumped and wanted to veer my car off the road. I entered my home, and sobbed for an hour. I said maybe three words to her. You can’t even begin to process what’s happening. It’s a numbing experience, especially if it’s your first breakup with someone you honestly loved. 
I couldn’t be left alone. I needed to constantly talk about the breakup. I cried at work, you need to go to those bad places to get yourself back up.

 I ate nothing for three days and ran about 65 miles that week (I am a distance runner, because I had nothing but my thoughts in the darkness to keep me company, knowing that she was probably sound asleep and happy with her decision. Just power through it, it’s really all you can do during those dark moments.

I’d constantly think I would hear her car pulling in the driveway thinking that she’d be showing up to reconcile things. Other times

Sound familiar? Perhaps you didn’t handle it exactly as I did, given the magnitude of your heartache and specificity of your relationship, but the fact remains that a breakup is a breakup, and it hurts the same. Trust me.

If this is the point you’re at in the breakup, keep reading.

Ok, see no contact below), but I guarantee you won’t find solace in their words- at least, not for long. Even if you discover that they still care about you, it won’t feel good in the long run because it will only give you hopes that could be thrashed. Trust me- nothing they can say will give you any permanent recovery.
Start by ridding yourself of anything that reminds you of them. You don’t have to throw their things away, small gifts, even movies that we watched. Get it out of sight. Then, perhaps you should rearrange your room so you can live in a new, clean environment. Avoid places where you might run into them. What helped me was going back home to my mother’s house and seeing my friends. It was a good reminder that I had a life before my ex. 

You are going to neglect yourself for awhile. Your performance will slip, or even keeping your house clean. You might stop eating, or you might take unhealthy comfort in food. You’ll franticly search the internet for advice, desperate to try anything (after all, that’s what we’re doing here). I urge you to not read guides on “how to get your ex back,” but instead on how to move on. However, don’t become addicted to reading about breakups. By all means, but when you begin looking for closure via the internet

Recognize the emotional storm that you’ll be entering. For awhile, you will be empowered- being fully aware that what has happened is nothing unheard of. It was a breakup between two people, these things happen, etc. You will be confident that you’ll find love elsewhere. And other days, you’ll be livid. Filled with rage. How dare they break your heart? Fuck them. Stupid bitch. What an asshole. Why couldn’t they get their shit straight? Too bad you still love them.

Again, you shouldn’t say anything to them- even if you’re so tempted to find closure.

No Contact:
The cardinal rule of a breakup. If you’ve been reading up on breakups lately, Instagram, Reddit, anything. Even their family and friends. There should be no flow of information between you two.
I personally blocked my ex on Facebook, while I was moping like a pathetic, sniveling animal. She was posting shit about her ex and moving on and being who she needs to be. It’s painful to look at it. I wanted to see the direction that her emotions were going to head (because “what if?!”), but only found pain. Even when she started posting about making a mistake, being crazy, and being heartbroken- what does that do for me? Now she’s miserable without me- it doesn’t help me to see that, either. Take my advice (and the advice of everyone else who has overcome a breakup), but give it at least two weeks with 100% no contact. See how you feel.

My ex still follows me on instagram, because she’s still confused but doesn’t want to lose me. Whether your ex is trying to jump around to new relationships to spite you or trying to keep in touch with you, please do yourself a favor and remain calm. If you have to ask that they leave you alone to protect yourself, do so in a civil manner- don’t snap at them. Keep the solitude you need. 

The no contact rule will probably drive them a bit crazy. It’s human nature to want what you can’t have, don’t use no contact as a means to get your ex back- the purpose is for self-discovery and healing. You may discover that after 30-60 days of no contact, you might not even want anything to do with your ex. If they weren’t able to keep themselves from stalking you while you were busy putting your life back together to where you can stand strongly (and happily single) on your own two feet, that’s their own fault.

For me, the fact is that she is someone else now. If this is your first love (as it was mine), I’m sorry you’re having your innocence stolen. People change, but not always for the worst. Remain hopeful- and remind yourself that you are worthy of love!

Don’t you DARE let yourself be guilted into helping your ex battle their current demons. You don’t owe them a god damn thing. If your ex reaches out to you for help, and that she’s wanted nothing more than to call me. It took everything in me not to tell her that everything is okay and that she can come back- that I’ll wait for her. All I told her was “good luck,” and even in the days that followed, I felt like should have bitched her out instead of being nice. You are not emotionally stable. Do not contact your ex. Silence is your friend.

Post-Breakup: The Recovery Process and Fixing Yourself

Hey, it’s time to start to come back up. It’s right to be down- it’s right to feel all this pain, but it’s not right to stay there. Time to work on yourself.

This is when you assume control again. Your ex is finally out of contact, and take yourself where you wish to go. Here are some ways to do that:

-Realize that you’re not alone. You’re so far from being “alone.” You may feel trapped within your own emotions, stranger. I don’t care if you believe the holocaust was a good thing or if you like hurling aborted babies at nuns- you are hurting and you need to heal, no matter what differences we share. No matter where you live, what year you were born, the pain is the same. And nobody should have to feel this bad for long.

-Stop being pathetic (ouch- nobody wants to hear that). Sure, for neglecting your body, friends, and worklife. That word is depression, and the longer you stay in it, the longer it might take to get out of it. There is no quick fix for it. Work on projects, clean your house. Exercise helps a LOT (insert science and endorphin-talk here). Even if you don’t feel like it’s making you “better” in the moment- that is, the fact is that you’re still going through with the activity. That, and that is a very encouraging thought. Because when all of this is over

-Knock them off of their pedestal. I know, you must understand that the purpose of this exercise is not to make you hate them (you probably have enough fuel for that already), but to help you acknowledge that they were certainly not perfect for you. After all, if they were perfect for you, they wouldn’t have left you. Something just didn’t click right. It wasn’t until a few weeks out that I realized how dumb and catty my ex was. She was very attractive (I dated a dancer), but looks aren’t everything (clearly). She was mean to me when she was drunk, she was irritable, and she often embarrassed me in public when I saw her handle situations poorly and with little articulacy. Oh

-Highlight your own attributes. Realize that you did things that made this relationship work. Realize that you were a catalyst for events in someone else’s life and happiness. At the end of the day, I can still make a girl happy! I gave her comfort in her anxiety, and honestly- the shit I did for her, nobody will do again. I know there are girls out there who are waiting for a guy like me to come along. Hey, if you’re a girl who is sick of emotional bullshit and just wants a sweet, safe, dependable guy

-Actually, but don’t kid yourself. That’s not the way to handle things. If you see your ex enter a new relationship, it will cut you deep… but do chuckle for a moment. They’re missing out on something paramount and crucial to a healthy relationship- comfort within yourself. They’re temporarily filling the void while you’re becoming a fortress. Relationships don’t work when they’re a codependency. You must love yourself before you can love another (see Eternal Wisdom below). Easy there, tiger- take it a day at a time. Clearly, you’re not ready for a relationship right now- even with your ex again. If you’re here reading this, you’re at a crossroads with your emotions, and you need to resolve that yourself before you continue in any direction. 

-I personally don’t identify with a religion or higher power, MOTHER FUCKER- YOU JUST WOKE UP. You may not realize it, but you made SO many compromises during your relationship. Now is the time to not compromise ANYTHING. Now is the time to get what you want out of yourself. I have never LOVED my figure- I always feel scrawny and embarrassed to take my shirt off. I’m working very hard to correct that now with ab workouts and a new lifting plan. I am working on my house a lot to improve my living environment. I am planning trips and vacations with so many of my friends, and it’s great to see them and hear from them. When I go out to bars, I don’t search for girls to talk to, but I do notice them. I notice that there are so many other people in the world with complex intricacies and depth, just like my last partner had. Everyone has a story to tell,” but meet some people and see that society has been here the entire time!

-Come to terms with the healing power of time. I should mention, and you only get so much of it. While you may have to pay your dues to heartbreak, be sure to invest it in healthy activities!

-Keep a diary, grief and depression, acceptance) that if you try to write them out, it may shed some light on what you’re going through. It’s interesting to go back and read what you started with, just to see how much you’ve grown from this. Additionally, making a list of attributes that the “ideal partner” would have can help put into perspective if your ex really gave you all that you desire, in addition to the list of negatives I mentioned earlier. Don’t write this list fresh from the breakup. Give it a couple weeks

-Eventually, which represents a lot more progress than I’d find on here!

-You are a walking epiphany now. It’s so fucking awesome. I have learned more about the world and the people in it over the past month than the past year. You are so self-aware, no matter the form it assumes, is progress towards a new, wiser you. This is a chance for you to discover exactly who you are, or at least who you are meant to be so you can work towards it. I’ve been trying so many new things- playing new styles of music, listening to new genres, working out harder than ever before

-Finally, but it should give you a bit of comfort that you won’t feel awful forever. Imagine having an idle conversation with someone who had their heart broken some time ago, and interrupting them to ask if they are thinking about their ex in that moment or if they still feel heartbroken. I submit no, and that your question would take them by surprise. For me, it comes in the form of envisioning a life beyond my current one. I fantasize about finishing up my undergraduate degree in a year, moving far away from this place- out of this house, out of this bedroom that harbored most of the relationship for my ex and I, the more I think about it

Forgiveness

-Forgiveness is very slow and hard to make sense of, not so much. However, you know that you have to forgive to move on- whether it be yourself, your ex, or both. Perhaps your ex did some terrible, terrible things to you. Mine did. Even if you can’t find it in your heart to forgive them (now), you must accept that these things happened and that you are using them as ammunition to shape yourself for the better. You must forgive yourself if you hurt your ex. You are human, even if it hurts. When you’re stable enough, and I know that rushing myself into “love” might not always be the best choice. I have learned the importance of “moving on” before finding someone new (in my ex’s case)

-Channel your emotions healthily. If you’re here reading this, I don’t know every situation). However, you have a LOT of fuel right now. You have a lot of drive to feel better and not regress in the least- USE IT! My roommate went to taco bell last night, and I refused to eat anything from there. I refuse to eat unhealthy meals, and I exercise every day. Even if you don’t wish any ill upon your ex, success is the best revenge. Show them that you can function without them- even if it hurts to think about their absence being permanent. You are your own person! You do not NEED them, I promise.


Eternal Wisdom:

Here are some mantras and shreds of wisdom that have not only guided me through my breakup


-Repeat to yourself: “I gave myself to you for so long, you gave your LIFE to this person- your happiness, your trust, everything that you are. If they took that, threw it on the ground and stomped on it in front of you, then they don’t deserve it. Sure, some couples can reconcile things and get back together, are you really able to be with someone and look past that tarnish?


-It’s ok to be single, through thick and thin. Not about one partner getting themselves emotionally stable enough so that they can leave the other (i.e. my relationship). You MUST love yourself before you can love another. 


-Despite your experiences, personally, am very excited to fall in love again. It’s impossible for me to imagine it without anyone but my most recent ex, but I know it’s out there. I’m excited for my first kiss again! It’s out there. Just don’t look for it too hard, especially right now. It will be a weird experience, no doubt. A different kind of love than your most recent, but I promise that you are malleable and impressionable and that you will adjust your personality to fit someone you like- you certainly did it in your last relationship


You will be ok. Maybe not today, or maybe even 10 minutes, and realize that slowly but surely, you’re healing. Maybe you’ll successfully flirt with the opposite sex. Celebrate your small victories, and live your life through healthy, fulfilling activities. It gets better. It gets better. I promise, it gets better.

A ton has happened since my last post.  My fiance proposed to me before I had a chance to talk to him about the ring.  In hindsight, sweet things like this aren’t very rare with him.  Still, I understand that I should have acted more quickly but at the same time I know it’s too late to cry over spilled milk
The ring really is beautiful.  When he proposed to me I completely forgot about talking to him about the price; I was far too excited.  Even though I was aware that he was planning on proposing, I really don’t want to give it up.  It’s not the price or anything like that.  I love it because it’s my engagement ring.  I already had a conversation with him about the price and he told me it wasn’t about his insecurities.  He said he wanted to show me how important I am to him and that he’s willing to give up anything to make me happy.  I don’t know if I’m letting my emotions get the best of me but I really believe him.  I know the price discussion isn’t really on his mind because he’s been trying to get me to go along with this prenup (there’s no way I’m letting him sign one of those).  What does Reddit think?  Should I keep the ring?  My friends want me to keep it but I’m not sure if that’s the right thing to do.  I know that when I look at it I should be thinking about what my fiance had to give up but in reality I just think about how much he loves me and how happy he makes me.  Yes, the money could be spent on a much more noble cause but I feel really happy when my fiance only wants to spend his money on me.  

I’m sure there are much more serious issues but I would really appreciate some advice on this.  

Please stop commenting about the ""1%"".  You can do that anywhere else.

**************************************************************************************************
First off, most of you (minus trolls) are really great people. So seriously - thank you. Also - I don't expect anyone to read this fully (it's gonna be long), but I feel like I have to finish my trilogy. Even if it's a shitty trilogy.   
   
So
 
Things got... weird. Very quickly. After that update
   

**************************************************************************************************
**The Vacation:**

For Christmas, seen where I grew up or anything else. I wanted him to understand my roots. To know who my best friends were. To see that I truly was a southern girl living in the big city. It just meant so much to me. We arrive in town and things between us are ok (not amazing, but good given the recent events). My mother picks us up and takes us back to the house. From there we begin chatting, and everything seems fine. They have a room off the side of the house (think mother-in-law suite) so that's where we'll be staying. Which is great, because my parents are very conservative, southern, christian people and the fact that they were okay with this was great. I did, agree to sleep on the couch (because I love that couch and the bed sucks in comparison, letting us borrow their car and feeding us. I think we can deal with separate places for a bit."" All seemed good.    
   
My parents had moved out of my home town about 2 years ago. So while it was their house now, really, southern. So we went on a day trip out to that area. I grabbed some friends, we all met up at a local hole in the wall BBQ joint and I was trying to introduce him. He instantly shut down and was not sociable. Odd, but.. ok, I'll deal. Then I tell him that I'm going to take him on a drive through tour of my home town and then we'd go to a friends for a bit. So I'm driving him around and explaining where I grew up (""That's our one stop light in the whole town... we have 7 churches here... That's the house I grew up in... that's where I built forts..."") and just general BS about me. I look over and I see he's asleep in the passenger seat. I just yelled his name, he woke up and then we got into a fight about how the one thing I was looking forward to (touring my town, and frankly how hard it was to get out of) he fell asleep for. ""I'm sorry! I can't help it! Cars make me fall asleep!"" ok, let's make this work. I put on my smile and we continued on. That was the only thing that really happened back home.    
   
**My trip to my brothers:**
After my boyfriend left (he was there for 5 days), we had been really working our relationship for a solid year, and things were great. But, I had only really seen him about 5x in my life. This trip was a big deal for me, as I would get to see the home he bought, the city he lives in, etc. Just like when he had visited, but the time this trip was done
   
B could NOT DEAL with this. At all. Where my brother lives, I'm sorry but I'll be home soon. What does he do instead? B decided to call me 3x a day. Breakfast lunch and dinner. Why? Just to say hi. If I didn't answer (which was often) he'd get upset and leave stupid passive aggressive voicemails on my phone about ""guess you're too busy for your boyfriend"" and then I'd have to call back and diffuse the situation. This got out of control quickly where on the day I was leaving, he texted me 40 messages (give or take a few, but I know it was over 30) about how I'm ignoring him, treating him like shit, don't care, etc. etc. etc. Also, my brother is absolutely furious. He spoiled our one damn trip together. B also decided to email my mom about this and say ""Don't tell her but I think..."" and my mom immediately called me up
   
**Back to the city**   
After that... I think it just turned into trying to work it out, etc. I don't remember exactly how it was handled when I got home, but I do remember the end days.    
   
**All aboard the crazy train**
My boyfriend has always said he was a republican, but this takes the case).   
   
He has never owned a gun in his life and never shot one. But, that's a horrible idea. I told him I would not be going out with him in public with the gun unless he bought a front holster, and he exploded. Something about how he's keeping us safe, and if someone bursts into the movie theater with a gun, he'd protect us... what? I don't want to say that I'm some marksman of sorts, but my father was a Navy SEAL. I've been around guns my entire life and learned Krav Maga early too. Boyfriend just bought a gun and is clueless. I do not feel safe. But, I lay down the law and he breaks it. Things start going south. They get even worse when he tries to bring the gun into my home and I absolutely refuse. No weapons but my own.   
   
Then starts the crazy talk. Because of Obama, that could get any weapon we wanted. This turned into a LOT of fights and at one point I asked him if he'd go to counseling with me. Nope. Apparently just I need counseling because I didn't understand the war that was going on...   
   
No wait, much lest befriended. We went out to a few bars to have some drinks where he would get horribly drunk (boy can't hold his booze) and then be aggressively all over me when we got back home (yup, warning. Especially as my last boyfriend was abusive and he knew this). Then, he'd post on facebook about how Christians who drink are scum and would turn into the most hypocritical person I've ever known. I was blown away by these changes in him, I knew that there was no turning back.    
   
**************************************************************************************************   
Edit: As for the sexual aggressive behavior - we've always had an open and fun time in the bedroom. But after drinking (after 1.5 years) he'd get oddly controlling. I don't want to say ""force"" me into bed, this when I knew 100% (as opposed to 95%) that we were done.   
**************************************************************************************************    
    
**The End:**So, but... I seriously loved him. He was my best friend. We were truly lovers and friends - we'd go bowling and BS all night with friends, and the next night it was a romantic date planned. To this day, I have no clue where my best friend went to, or where he currently is.    
   
This is getting really long, how amazing he was doing, and trying to make me jealous. The last conversation we had was a 3am text from him about something that actually started with ""You're going to be so jealous"" and then explaining something that had happened. I responded with ""Gratz?"" and the response was (word for word) ""Forget it. I don't even know why I bother. You won't hear from me until I text you again."" - That was 3 weeks ago.

[Update](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1dtlxp/update_23fight_with_my_bf_22_brings_up_a_lot_of/)

TL;DR so far: BF of 3 and a half years was initially not okay with me having a friendship with my ex, let's all hang out. Next year and a half, BF claims to be okay with it, so I make plans for a music video with G. BF gets very upset during argument, and admits that he's not as okay with it as he let on. Next day, we discussed the argument. BF says I should make the video because he doesn't want to hold back my career. Admits that my friendship with G does bother him to a point, but is willing to suck it up for this video.

It's been over a week since my first post, after all the stress it causes me and my BF. I looked down deep, and realized that after all these years, I guess G still has a piece of my heart. Not saying I would ever leave my BF for him, because I wouldn't, but a younger part of myself comes to life when I speak to G. He reminds me of a time when I really thought anything was possible, before adulthood trampled me with bills, and stress.

G represents good times, he calls me when he's bored or feeling sad about himself. He's fun to hang out with, but he only wants to hang out when he feels like it. Prime example: since I set a date to film this video, he hasn't contacted me. I tried to organize a meeting, but he never responded. This is all starting to feel like a big waste of my time and energy.

We were supposed to film this weekend, but I'm calling it off. I told him it had started to feel like I was putting other people before him, but I want him to know he's my first priority. I teared up and told him I'm sorry, and he held me and said, ""I know, but you don't have to be.""

Can't believe I'm doing another update already...

We just received a text from James* and what we thought and tried so hard to avoid has happened.  

Here is his message:

""I cannot believe you have done something as disgusting as you just did. And on top of that to send Bob (a mutual friend who wasn't involved. we asked him to check on him.)  out of university to come to my house? She said she was suspicious of you, everything is already booked. In the mean time I'm going to try to fix the problems that have been caused today. I want to be left alone for a while, please respect that wish.""

We are from Scotland. In the fake profile

I personally am done.  She has him were she wants him.  I consider this the end of our friendship.  Thank you to everyone for your input.  Today was a shit day.

Right so, have a normal evening and continue adding to the draft letter I had started writing about how I felt it all went to shit as soon as I opened the door to him. A day full of finally venting my feelings, being upset about the fact that he had been with her and reading all of the advice/opinions/comments that you guys so helpfully left had left me rather emotional! I had spent most of the day in tears, terrified that when I spoke to him, (cause I had realised by this point it was inevitable for my own sanity) he would freak out, not understand or I would hear something I didn't want to hear. Worst case, in the scenarios built up in my mind

 I opened the door and he took one look at my puffy eyes and drained face and he looked seriously worried. ""Whats happened?!"" He asked as he embraced me. I took him into the living room, and that the fact he was loyal had never bothered me and it was lovely that he could be like that, but that I had a massive problem with one of his girls. I explained that it wasn't that I didn't trust him with her but that she made me feel uneasy and pushed out. I said that I had mentioned it at the begining of the relationship then been afraid to bring it up again for fear of seeming possesive. He said, ""Is this about Megan?"" And I told him it was. He told me, ""She doesn't like me in that way, she's just like that with her friends."" I explained to him a few of the reasons (from other post) that had made me see it in another light. 

He absorbed this and looked as though he may be realising. ""I can completely see how that would look

 This isn't the end of this problem, I don't think I would have spoken to him otherwise.

TL;DR: Finally spoke to my boyfriend after 14 months of feeling like his female ""best friend"" was in love with him and trying to undermine me. I think we're on the road to recovery. Thank you.

Well Reddit it’s been a helluva week.  I have 1 night on the computer for this

Your help was indispensable last week and really helped me to put a lot of the situation into perspective.

The OFP (Order for Protection) was granted last Thursday, and I felt I absolutely needed a no-contact order after kicking him out this time.  

This decision killed me

A few things to address from the first post:

There were concerns about abusing an OFP for personal gain.   In my original post I didn’t go into detail about everything he’s put me through (the original post was already a novel.) The OFP was

Also

Also also, it seems pretty passive.  This is the perfect example of everything fucked about our marriage, however.  He is too drunk for me to ever discuss anything with him ever, even simple stuff like a budget.  We could conceivably learn in therapy how to communicate and discuss important matters, but not unless he’s sober to learn them. 

For the record, and that the next step was for my husband to get treatment as recommended by the professional assessment.  Therapy was not advised until he was sober.  My husband himself couldn’t handle the sessions; when we finally starting talking about why we were there, he threatened to walk out and the therapist had to stop everything to make him pay the co-payment in the middle of the session because he had become threatening.  That was the last session we had in thereapy.

**So

Thursday evening after the locks were changed I called his mother to arrange dropping off his stuff (I left him a duffel bag of essentials in his pickup, so I was expecting at the worst a luke-warm response.

Nope.  She told me they wanted to go through the cops to get his stuff and wouldn’t let me come over.  She then told me to fuck off.  Okay

She never responded when I asked her about her offer to help with an intervention.

Sunday morning I got the voicemail from my husband’s new’ lawyer requesting I call him back concerning divorce papers.  As of today

I cannot afford a lawyer and my parents are retired and can’t help.  My husband’s family has hired a spendy lawyer so I know I need one.  I’ve been through several low-income resources already so hopefully one will pan out for me

Otherwise, and that that is just as crazy-making to live with as physical abuse.  I’m thankful for the law that recognizes that and lets me protect myself.

I will be putting in my resignation to the company tomorrow (I took a leave of absence this week) and have the joy of job-hunting to look forward to.

I have not given much thought yet about how to address the issue of all the drunk driving occuring where we work because of the boss’ Free Beer Club.  This was the biggest feedback I got from you Reddit

I am most thankful for the awesome network of amazing girlfriends who have stood by my side from the beginning. I could not have gotten through this week without them.

**TL;DR  -  I can honestly say that I would prefer to be single and unemployed than be married to my husband and employed by the company that is keeping him drunk.**


**EDIT #1** - Anonymity

**EDIT #2** - I haven't shared the details of all the abuse that occurred

Good question. Yes, etc. This is physical abuse.

He once was so pissed that he had to drive me to the hospital because I was sick and had to go to ER that he **ditched me in the parking lot** once we were there. I was bawling and begging him to come inside with me

Original thread TL;DR: I am a grown-ass woman

You guys gave me a ton of good advice and a reality check that I wasn't the one being disagreeable. 

We went on the visit, and had a great time. In fact, we did it once more since then and are about to do so again. On these visits, not much has been said about our arrangements, but my mother was visibly unhappy (facial expressions/body language) and made passive-aggressive comments about ""all that driving"" and whatnot.

We're about to go again for Christmas. I got a note from my mom asking about my plans in which she indicated that she is ""getting our rooms ready."" I thought it was manipulative to say that instead of just asking if we would like to stay with her, which just included one line noting we are getting a hotel. 

Today she wrote an email saying almost exactly what I predicted she'd say last year: 

""Please reconsider and stay with us. We'd like that very much. We see you so seldom. Come on

I am responding with some text that is basically an amalgam of your advice from last year: 

""So-and-so and I prefer to sleep in the same bed and have some quiet time during our visits

If she brings it up again this time or on the next visit

Thanks!


**** Now with MORE updates ****

EDIT 15 hours after original post:

Should I start a new thread for this?

I sent the above email. She replied:

&gt;Since you are always frank with me, if that many. Surely, you can be in separate beds a few days. Good grief, [my name], be more mature.

(Followed by a long quotation about how you have to spend time with people to show you love them

I replied:

&gt;I'm sorry you feel so strongly about the issue of sleeping arrangements. I have already stated the reasons why I want to sleep in the same bed with [bf] during previous conversations about this. We're adults, and it's my prerogative to stay in a hotel if that doesn't work for me. I respect your preferences on the sleeping situation, and I have requested that you respect mine in turn. I'm not going to discuss it again.

Then she replied:

&gt;[My name], I have continuously tried to change behaviors that I deem inappropriate, even though you are now an adult. You are correct in saying you are responsible for your own life, but remember that actions have a consequences. 


Ughhh. I have set a boundary that I am not going to discuss it, although I do want to see my dad and other family. I'm trying to figure out how to say ""that mindset is not going to work for me"" without further engaging her in an argument. 

You guys have been amazing so far on teasing out the fundamentals of this disagreement. More help would be appreciated!

I asked him about it today


I told him I didn't want any bullshit excuses and that this was his last chance and that if he wanted to break up then fine

He said he didn't want to break up because he loves me but feels like he's too young to settle down. I then said that was ridiculous because I'm younger than him and have so many things I want to do, then fine, but it's his loss. 

He didn't say anything else then

I wanted the next time I said that to someone to be something I really meant. Something I've thought about and analyzed and I've done that with him. I do love him. He's turned my world upside down in all of the good ways. I've never met anyone like him. Never felt so happy. Never felt so sure. 

This is also the first time I've ever told a guy I've loved him first. Fuck. I feel so sorry for the guys out there that traditionally have to take on this burden. It was SO terrifying. And when I finally managed to squeak it out, now I know that he probably never will.

We've been together for more than 7 years, checked the calendar twice, etc. 

I went up a few days early to help my parents with their party, but the next day didn't get up and get moving in time to make it to my parents' party (it's a very long drive). This is the first Christmas that we've been engaged, and my parents have been chatting to their friends about it non-stop. It was a Christmas party, but also a time for them to show off their daughter and to-be son-in-law. 

At my parents' party, when the wedding was (we haven't set a date), why haven't we set a date, what's our problem, why can't we have the wedding at my parents' house (fiance doesn't want a backyard wedding), and generally embarrassing me, since I don't like answering questions for the both of us. When a friend of mine [m] arrived at the party, and I had to explain to everyone that he was not. It was embarrassing and humiliating.

My fiance finally arrived after people had gone home, as we had no private time together.

Christmas morning came, but it really hurt that zero effort was put forth on a gift when I already took a back seat to his priorities for Christmas parties.

How the hell do I tell him just how crushingly upset I am? He doesn't seem to understand that these were so hurtful. He said he was sorry about the party-- he wasn't feeling well that morning that he should have left (to which I said he should have planned ahead).

He was very sorry he disappointed me, and knew why I was upset.

Earlier in the year she went through some tough emotional times as someone close to her passed away in old age. I also went through something similar as my uncle recently passed.

But we got through it together and to me our relationship has never been better. To the point that I've been shopping for an engagement ring and thinking about taking the next step!

Now here's where I need some help:

I just discovered that in the past year my girlfriend has spent close to  $10, to stockpiles of bathroom / beauty products, to fast food and god knows what else. Over the past two years she has quietly spent her ENTIRE LIFE SAVINGS which she was planning on using as part of a downpayment on a townhouse.

She broke down to me in tears last night and told me everything:

- She told me she has a spending problem and has quietly spent her entire life savings (tens of thousands of dollars) in the past couple of years. 

- She told me she owes thousands in back taxes to the government and has no way of paying it. 

- She told me she regularly gives away money she doesn't have to friends

- She told me she has an eating problem and virtually every night for the past few months has been eating a fast food dinner on her drive home from work before we sit down and have dinner together at home. 

- She told me she's booked vacations (Las Vegas etc.) with her girlfriends that she can't afford or pay for

- She told me she doesn't even have enough money left to pay for gas to get to work this week!!

- She showed me her personal Savings bank account statements for the past 60 days and there are hundreds of transactions for everything imaginable. She's over drafted with nothing left.

My dilemma is that we're no longer 20 somethings with nothing to lose. We're older now and I feel betrayed - like the 5 years we spent together have been awesome but now it would be impossible to take the next step.

I love her dearly and hope and pray that she can stop spending money. But I'm no longer sure it's a healthy relationship for me to be in.

We put together a weekly and monthly budget and she cut up all her cards last night. Basically it will take her 12-months of hard work (redirecting almost all of her salary) to pay off all of her bills and get her back taxes settled. During that time I will have to cover all of our living expenses. 

And that's assuming she doesn't start spending again. I love her dearly but feel like she just killed our relationship. I've asked her why

**edit** do you think it would be wise to show her this Reddit Post? The feedback and advice everyone has provided has been great and I thank-you all! But now I feel like we're talking behind her back. Should I keep this Reddit conversation to myself or share it with her?

We had a great time, all four of us, and on our last night there, John told us he wanted to go to the Bellagio fountains to see them before we had to leave. Everyone was up for it, we went for a nice dinner beforehand, and I was really enjoying myself, but he never did. He just informed all of us that he wasn't feeling well and wanted to go back to the hotel. Our friends looked really puzzled and were whispering into each other's ears all the way back to the hotel. I kept asking John if he was okay

We've been back for a couple of weeks, who I'm fairly close to, and asked her if she knew what was going on with John, since he had been at their place a lot this past week instead of coming home. Eventually, she spilled the beans and told me he had plans of proposing to me that night at the fountains, but then didn't. That's why the two of them had been acting so confused. I kept grilling her and she also told me that John had told his friend that ""it didn't feel right"". She made me promise not to tell John that I knew because she didn't want anyone to be upset with her.

I'm feeling sick to my stomach. We live together and he has been spending all of his time at his friend's house or at his parents place since we got back. He barely calls me or responds to my texts anymore. I don't know what happened that night but I feel like he's about to end things. 

I want to talk to him, I heard you were gonna pop the question the other night, but changed your mind. What gives?""

Was he really nervous? Ah I'm freaking out.

tl;dr found out boyfriend was going to propose but changed his mind at the very last minute. Said it ""didn't feel right""

How should I handle this in the morning?,borisov84,273,48,116,"Every year my uni mates and I [31 m] spend a few days at my mates family's summer house. They've been bringing their respective girlfriends and wives the past few years

We got in today after a long train, when we got up to go to bed (we had to share a bed, but we've slept together platonically before, so it was nbd), it became obvious how drunk she was . She could barely walk down the hall, she was tripping and falling so much. I had to help her walk.

We got to the bedroom, and trying to pull my shirt off. We're both laughing at this point, because it's still fully hitting me exactly what's happening. Then she asks, in this very giggly-slurred-drunk way, ""Do you want to fuck me?""

The answer to that is Yes, and having a hard time at it. I told her we were going to go to sleep and she should get ready for bed. I went to the bathroom and jerked off (I am human, after all), and when I got back, she was in her underwear, struggling to get a shirt on. I helped her, then got into bed. She started coming onto me again, so said ""Lets just lie here for a while."" So she cuddled up to me and pretty quickly fell asleep.

I've never been in a situation like this. I've never had a romantic situation (if you can call it that) with a friend, and in the morning (after she gets sick) if she asks I'll tell the truth, but probably won't bring it up. I don't know if that's the right course of action, however.

I asked him to come stay with me to get some help.

Because I wanted to help him start over, food, living expenses, etc. This was with the understanding that he would do his part around the house, not get arrested again, and other everyday rules. 

He refuses psychiatric care

He was arrested last week for public intoxication. I spent a bunch of time looking up information online to see if he would go back to jail. I had a free consultation with an attorney.

All this time

He basically goes to work, no life really. 

He blames me for everything. He blames me for everything from not having a girlfriend to his unhappiness. He saw me as a tyrant growing up because I expected him to go to school

I wake him up around noon on his days off usually and ask him to do things like check into his probation and sell his car, which has cigarette burns on the floor and old food laying around. 

I could go on

Our conversations go like this: 

Me: Hey, but you've got to show up for your life.

Him: There's nothing wrong with me! You were a bad mother

Me: Well, but it doesn't change that you're not living healthy and I'm worried about you.

Him: I'm fine! You just don't like who I am! I don't want to work for someone else for little pay for the rest of my life! 

Me: That's fine. But

Him: I'm selling my car and hitchhiking across the country! 

Me: That's not a lot of money and you owe other people money right now.

Him: FUCK IT! I don't care! I don't want to live how you want me to live! You're holding me back! You made me move here away from all of my friends!

I didn't make him move. I offered him a place to stay. He'd been evicted after running up a $7000 bill at the house he rented. Also

I don't know what to do. I try talking to him and he just says

I paid for him a gym membership because he thought that might help his depression. But

I'm sick of it. He's all the family I have. My mother and I are estranged because she's a former abusive drug addict/alcoholic and current Jesus freak. I couldn't take it

So, it makes me uncomfortable, and I didn't know how I should feel about it.  She told me that they only talk sparingly and it's usually just catching up, and that I had nothing to worry about.

Fast forward three weeks or so.  There's a way on SnapChat to see the top 3 people that your friends snap, I was upset, because now it seemed like it was more than just catching up.  

Throughout the entire time we dated,  enjoyed being with me, and although didn't want something serious at the time she wanted to keep working toward something serious.  Again, the time we talked about her ex, she told me that I shouldn't worry and it was not a big deal.  So I message her while she's at work, letting her know what I saw and that it really made me upset and uncomfortable.  After all, she was dating me

She comes over after work and basically straight up tells me she has unresolved feelings for him and is going to give him another chance.  This is the guy who left her at the airport when she flew into town to visit him and didn't even show up to the house, celebrated an anniversary, or celebrated a holiday with her.  A guy who never once came to visit her.  A guy who, when she got into the final round of a law school mock trial competition and unfortunately lost, told her ""Sorryz.  But hey I got a new phone!""  A guy who she constantly told me she was unhappy with and felt like there was too much shit to work out.  The guy who told her that ""you're immediately replaceable"" when she had her first real talk with him (not even to break up, just to talk).  The guy who told her that he refuses to be with anyone who has pets and basically told her she would have to get rid of her cats (she has not and will not do this).  Just to name a few issues.

And now she wants to give him another chance.  Not only that, but that she doesn't want to.  

So here's my thing.  I'm having a few issues right now.  First of all, it must seem silly to react so badly.  But I have no idea how to explain it other than the cliche ""this one felt so much more different.""  Like, before she and I even started dating, something in my mind was like ""this is the girl you're going to marry.""  And during the relationship, everybody thought we were going to get married.  For the first two months (before her ex started talking to her again), the relationship was beyond perfect.  I mean it was storybook perfect.  And for once, I feel like I really did everything right.  I opened doors for her, bought her dinner, she's constantly told her friends that I did nothing wrong

So here's a few things I would like your opinions and cold-hard truths about.  First, so I think that's not only a lie, but really stupid).  But either way, how do I control this?  Do I just ignore it?  

Second

Finally, but I have this part of me that absolutely does not want to give up on her.  When I say that we felt absolutely perfect, I'm not even kidding.  I want that back.  But I don't know (a) whether I should try, or (b) if it's even worth it.  And if it is, how do I do it?  Do I just leave her alone and let her make her own mistakes?  

She's changed over the past couple months.  She's turned very stone cold and has become extremely hardened and secretive, too.  That's something else that upsets me, because this dude was so abusive for the year and a half they were together that I have absolutely no doubt that he's feeding her lines about how she doesn't need them and they aren't worth it.

So anyways.  It ended badly, and how I can cope with this burning anger I have toward her for doing this to me.

Thanks for reading this guys.

EDIT: I'm starting to believe, but that for the first two months it was exactly what I want a relationship to be.  And that's what I'm holding onto.  The more that I can convince myself that there is more than one person out there who can offer the perfect relationships, the easier it'll be to move on

Recently we had a conversation about strip clubs

He said he has gotten lap dances while we've been dating and has no intention to stop getting them.  We got into an argument because as I stated, I cannot get too mad at him for getting them while we've been dating.  

However

His response was that if I just want to control him and if I don't allow lap dances then there is no limit to the things I won't allow such as going out with his friends, he goes on regular weekend trips, been to bachelor parties, and out with friends - I had never had any fuss about these and wished him well.  He acknowledged that that is true, but said he will still never stop getting lap dances on the principle of the matter.

This really hurts me and makes me feel like he has no respect for my boundaries.  I feel like it won't matter if I ever bring up when something makes me uncomfortable because if he sees nothing wrong with it

Am I being controlling and/or irrational?


TL;DR - boyfriend gets lap dances at strip clubs


**UPDATE: Thanks everyone for the replies

**At this point, feeling validated is nice (but I won't be using that alone as justification for my cause).  There are also several men and women who feel as though he is right in seeing lap dances as harmless.**  

**I heard a lot of ""Dump him now, more rational conversation - we're capable of that and I'm sure if this relationship doesn't work out, it will end on a calm, realistic note, not in anger over principles/jealousy.  So we talked a little more, in a calmer state and agreed upon a couple things:**

**1. I am allowed to feel any emotions I experience

**2. He told me that he was irrational to assume I would start taking away weekend trips

**3. He told me that he really doesn't care about lap dances, more rational manner (thanks reddit for helping me with the language!) that my concerns made sense.  He said he will still probably have one or two more lap dances in his life at bachelor parties likely, but I will be on his mind and the idea of hurting me over something unnecessary will be enough to skip them.**

**Part of this last conclusion was established when I pointed out how upset and hurt he was a long while back when I went streaking with some friends (men and women) even though I saw it as harmless and he thought I crossed the line - that allowed him to understand that while we may disagree on the specific issue at hand, just concerned or hurt by the situations.**

I don't believe my character and intentions are bad. I've supported her and provided everything in the world for my wife.  I do not hit her or abuse her in anyway.  To be fair, on the other hand still cusses me out, uses F-in this and f-in that, and demeaning comments towards me.

I made her apologize to my family for acting disrespectful towards them, but nevertheless, she did.  At the time, a year ago, I told her that if she could not get along with my family, we couldn't be married. So I guess it was an ultimatum.  I am very close to my parent and right now they are getting old and really need my help the most. I am not going to put them in a home, ever. They've done so much for me and raised me, bailed me out of several sticky situations

In return for the ""apology"" my wife made to my parents

Since last Oct, hurtful things, and not being able to take all the verbal abuse, I end up making a sarcastic or passive aggressive remark.  That remark or comment I made, makes her even more mad, and she gets louder and angrier. Basically, she wants to yell at me like a piece of trash and I sit there and ""take it"" and ""shut the fuck up.""

Well, things were going OK. By the way, she starts getting angry at me when I do little things wrong to make her mad. They are insignificant to me like coming home at 3:30 instead of 3, or forgetting to fill the dog bowl, or serving her cold fruit when she has told me repeatedly she likes it at room temperature, or putting too much cream cheese on her bagel and making it look sloppy,  i mean

She says, and 20 mins later, I'm fine and happy again. She cannot do this.  She also says she will be testing me the more I break these promises and she NEEDS to test me to make sure that this final promise I made to her is FOR REAL.

**The Kicker:**

Well, so I understand she was moody. Ok. She was nagging me all day long about little things and such and I just simply apologized, and admitted fault.  

At night, so obviously I asked her because what if she didn't want to drink sour juice?

Knowing she was in a pissy mood, and about 5 minutes later, I said ""baby, are you going to drink your juice?""  Well she responded by picking up the glass and dumping the contents into the sink down the drain. Six whole hand squeezed oranges. It may just be OJ and a small thing, but you know, it hurt me really bad when she did that. 

I was FURIOUS at that and it kinda pushed me over the cliff. I responded in a soft tone ""you did not have to do that and you are a terrible person.""  Well, she knew I couldn't keep my promise and that I failed her again. Divorce.

My wife intentionally tested me and kept driving me over the cliff and set me up to fail.  I feel that she is abusing me this way and making me look like I am just a compulsive liar and cannot honor a simple promise when she has already lived up to her end by apologizing and getting along with my family.

Well, they are really good. BUT, they never last for more than a few days.  My wife acknowledges her anger and says it will only get better over time and if and only if I stick to my promise.

**TL;DR**  My wife is leaving me because I continually break my promise to her but I feel that she intentionally sets me up to fail her little tests. Wife also refuses counseling and is extremely stubborn and views her way as the right away 100%. I cannot talk to my wife. When she yells at me, I was wrong"" ""It's all my fault"" ""I screwed up again, I'm sorry.""

  Well, he got stuff done, but it was an issue with him that he was very defensive about. Like a child. Anyway. He was also very, very strange about his phone. Very secretive and almost violent. And everything on his computer is zipped or hidden and password protected. This was the first notable red flag. Another would be that he jerks off anywhere from 3-6 times a day. He has denied me sex for jerking off and that has made me upset before. I must for his sake add that he is a very ""good"" boyfriend. Very affectionate and thoughtful and has always treated me extremely well and given me lots of love. He always made me very happy. 

  Well I began using his things with no ill intent at all and he started to become more and more strange. I started to notice things. His internet history would always be clear. I used his phone camera and for a split second it showed pictures that he had deleted. I became very suspicious and I all though I am NOT proud of it at all

  I am absolutely appalled and disgusted at what I found. Literally hundreds of pictures  of jail bait. Perhaps thousands.  There were lots from even before we were dating.  I also found a shit load of pics of his exes all when they were underage. He had mostly accessed the folder of his exes

  I felt like this wasn't everything so I said nothing until I could see on his phone. I would have confronted him about but he would first deny it and lie like I was stupid and second delete everything entirely so I could never know the truth. What I found on his phone was worse. I opened a locked app and clicked out almost immediately. It was a girl that looked between 10-12 in a sexualized outfit and pose. I became hysterical and immediately confronted him about everything. He did exactly like I thought... denied it

  I'm gonna wrap this up. He destroyed his hard drive and phone and threw them in a lake. He though I was gonna call the cops. He swore he was  gonna be honest  about everything  with a fresh start once we move, he said (I could still cry) ""Under high school age."" We moved and I now despise him. I hate him. I notice things now, he only checks out younger girls. The  things he says about women. I hate him now. I love him and still do but I don't want to touch him, or be around him, or look at him. I want his company sometimes but am constantly reminded of the betrayal and hurt. He says I am now overreacting. That I am obsessed with it and that all men do it.

No good conversation ever starts out with that phrase.

I already knew a lot about her tumultuous past: she came from an abusive home, they did not care). She got heavily into drugs, heroin specifically, before getting arrested for possession. Instead of sentencing her to prison she was ordered to complete a treatment program, which she did. She got clean, easily received her GED, and then went to college. We met when she was starting her first year at a very respectable state college after receiving her Associate's Degree at a community college.

What she had never told me before this weekend is that in addition to stripping she was also a prostitute between the ages of sixteen and twenty-three. Yes

She swears now that she hasn't been with anyone besides me since quitting that ""job"" three years ago. She claims that the reason she never told me before now is that back when she first told me about her days as a stripper I seemed sort of disgusted. Which might be true

Now that I know she was also a prostitute everything is different. For the first time since we started dating I actually made up an excuse rather than go to bed with her last night. I slept on the couch. This morning she was really upset about that but I just played it off like I fell asleep reading which was sort of true: I was reading and I did fall asleep on the couch. What I didn't tell her is that I did it on purpose.

She cheated on me! That's what part of me keeps thinking. Another part of me is just disgusted that she would do something so low and debasing as having sex for money. But the logical part of me keeps reminding me that she was in a very desperate situation back then. Who am I to judge her for doing what she had to do to get by?

I honestly don't know what to think. Suddenly the idea of marrying this woman isn't as appealing as it was just two days ago. I'm looking for any sort of advice: how should I proceed? Am I over-reacting? Should I tell her what I think or just appreciate she was honest with me (finally) and keep my mouth shut?

For roughly 1.5 years, and I'm fairly certain that I'm the only person she has told who doesn't also suffer from some form of ED. Apparently when she gets together (not very often, but occasionally) with these friends they talk with one another about their problems. But when they talk with each other, they just discuss their EDs as accomplishments; she has referred to having an ED as being ""part of a club"".

She has been dealing with this problem for close to 4 years now, where it can be pretty damn scary in my opinion (purging multiple times a day, severe self-hatred, etc.). She told me that she purged so badly a few days ago that she thought she bruised something internally, as it hurt to breath for the rest of the day.

Apparently, and she told me that she gets satisfaction over watching skinny people become fat. She works at a frozen yogurt place and she says that when she watches overweight people get very unhealthy yogurts, she ""smirks and gets such a sense of satisfaction"".

I am not overweight

I have talked to her multiple times about seeing a therapist, she said she couldn't because she ""needs it right now"".

I reeeeally want to inform someone, but she begged me to promise her to never tell a soul about anything, and I foolishly made that promised. She trusts me completely, and I feel like if I were to tell someone and she found out, things would never be the same.

The learning of this new ""source of satisfaction"" has been the last straw. We love each other dearly, and it also kills me inside that she doesn't see herself as the same beautiful person that I do. I feel helpless.

Please help me

**Partner:** Female

**Backstory:** We met through mutual friends about two years ago, a similar sense of humour and I asked her out on a date. Several dates later we made it official. As of now, we have been dating almost twenty months. 

We don't live together, about five or six months ago, she began to change from the girl I love to someone with a massive issue. Her father had recently divorced her mother and my SO took it pretty bad. I tried to help her through it but she blamed it all on me, took it out on me, hit me (not hard enough to cause me any harm but it shocked me to say the least). I would stand up for myself and leave her be until she came crawling back apologizing. 

However, she would come over in the middle of the night to my house and scream at me, she would throw my possessions around, breaking everything in a rage. And after the fight had finished, she would blame the argument and the broken items on me. 

One time, as it was not professional to mix personal issues with work, according to him. 

So about a week ago

However

Now I know that if she went to the police and accused me of this, so I told her to calm down and told her I wasn't thinking straight, I was just stressed with work and of course I wanted us to be together.

I told him again that I'm not interested in her life

I asked him last week why he feels the need to check, he just resorted to calling me insecure, saying that he was over her and had no interest in her anymore. So I said if that's the case then why feel the need to type her name into the search bar and browse her profile, but again he had no answer, and kept avoiding the question. I felt at that point that it wasn't worth causing an argument, so I let the conversation go. 

I also recently found out that he has been storing a large number of explicit pictures of her on his computer. You could easily say that he simply forgot they were there, and now I find that he simply moved them (to folder on the hard drive that is being used to store my uni work, go figure...he must think I'm stupid). I dropped it into conversation and he said that if he had any pictures like that it must be because he forgot that they were there, which made me quite annoyed because I had checked the date the folder was last accessed in order to know if he was lying or not. 

I know this all seems rather sneaky on my part but my boyfriend is very good at avoiding questions

Additionally,"" ""I remember when I did this with XXX,"" etc. He even used to accidentally call me her name quite regularly, something which became very annoying after about a year. Early in the relationship she contacted him, asking for money. He kept this hidden from me for a while, but eventually came clean that he was giving her extra money in addition to the money he owed her from when they were together. I told him to stop giving her the additional money, and he agreed. It felt like he was still trying to please her and get on her good side

It's been two years since we started going out, which is why I need to know whether or not my fears are justified, or simply something my mind has conjured from the scraps of old issues. 

I don't like to snoop or check up on people, and he denies having feelings for her. He even had the audacity to call me paranoid, when it's his behavior and white lies that have caused me to feel this way. 

Finally, and I believe it until something else comes up to make me reconsider. It's at the point now that I'm starting to appear paranoid and insecure over this, as he seems to see it as some kind of obsession on my part, but it really isn't. All I want is the truth, and I don't feel as if I've got it yet.

1361811317.0,1976s2,My uncle [M40ish] has inappropriately touched me [F17] and made sexual comments over the past few years.,throwaway_6856,272,52,145,"Right now I’m 17F

This uncle is a very humorous guy, note that he is divorced, but got remarried around this time last year (2012).

***••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••***

**Incident #1**

About two or three years ago, my uncle and brothers were joking around about that. There was this small statue of a boy next to one of the rides, and he had his mouth open. Well you can guess what kind of jokes they started making. Later on, I got a corndog, and whenever I put it in my mouth, my uncle would make comments, and then he and my brothers would start cracking up. I sat down and he sat down next to me and kind of put his arm around me.

Later on we split up, he took out his camera and started walking behind me. Then he told me to stop so that he could take a picture with his hand on my ass. I continued walking, and after that he kept trying to take pictures. I stopped. He urged me to continue walking, but I refused. He was disappointed but said something like “Oh alright,” as if I was ruining his fun.

While we were at the buildings with the shops, he knows that what he’s doing makes me feel uncomfortable, but he does it anyway?* We came across a jewelry section and he said I could pick out anything I wanted. I refused. Eventually we met back up with my brothers.

**Incident #2**

Some time after that (not sure how many months passed) he took me out to dinner. No physical contact, what my uncle said sums down to “Man, he thought I was banging this hot young chick!” Then proceeded to laugh like he always does.

**Incident #3**

Fast forward to about a month ago. My parents had the family over for a dinner. I was having a really bad day, my uncle comes in and feels bad because he thinks he’s the one that upset me. So he stays in for a while and tries to cheer me up with his sense of humor. After that, he started snooping around my room. He came upon two small bags from Victoria’s Secret. I had previously closed the bags with paper clips because of the obvious nature of their contents. My uncle gets all “Oooooooo” when he sees the bags, and asks if I have a boyfriend. He tries to open them, which I thought was way crossing the line. I swatted him away. He tried to convince me to “just let him see” but I wouldn’t budge.

Dinner is ready, he put his hand on my upper thigh and slowly moved it down for 2-3 seconds before laughing. Then he whispered to me to go in my room and try on the stuff in the bags, and then he would come in after me to see. I was like WHAT THE FUCKING HELL. I’m pretty sure he wasn’t joking, or if he was, he was only half-joking and half-serious. His wife was sitting right across from me at the dinner table. My jaw dropped and I said “NO!” He said “Why not? I would just look and I’d go in after you.” I was appalled. I tried to laugh it off after that and avoid all contact with him.

Maybe ten years ago, but our sex life wasn't great at the time, and I took it personally that she'd spurn my advances at night only to rub one out after I was asleep.  After a handful of instances over a few weeks, I confronted her about it (not angrily, but not gently, either) and she vehemently denied it.  I brought it up two or three more times shortly afterward to the same response.  I was never #totally# certain of what I'd witnessed and her denials were so strong, so I really wondered whether I had imagined the whole thing.  After a short stint of questioning my sanity, and so I put it out of my mind.

We got married three years later (seven years ago).  There have been a handful of times over the years where I've woken up and thought she might be having some solo fun.  I did not think much of it, but it's mostly been pretty good, so it's not like I felt left out or anything.

Fast forward to the present.  I've recently made a number of positive changes in my life (let go of some old anger, etc.) and started going to bed with her at the same time every night versus staying up hours later as I had been doing for the past few years.  After a few nights, I woke up after twenty to thirty minutes and she was masturbating (there was no doubt).  Remembering how defensive she was in the past and not wanting to make her feel awkward, I just laid there quietly and enjoyed the show for a few minutes before falling back asleep.  The next morning I was really turned on and we had some crazy, wild sex before the kids woke up.

I started paying attention to it a little.  Our new routine is that we spoon (with her as big spoon) for a few minutes and then switch.  Nearly every night she lays against me with one hand between her legs and I can feel her “feeling around” a bit.  Sometimes I fall asleep before we switch and sometimes I'm almost asleep and stay put when she rolls over.  Several times in the past few weeks she's gone onto a full-on self-love session when she thinks I'm already asleep.  I haven't said anything at all (and have laid quietly so she can have her time, and more than once I've used her “feeling around” as a cue to commence sexy times once we roll over.  I did think back to ten years ago one day and realize that I was probably not imagining things then and felt a little bit of resentment, but it was ten years ago and we were in a much different place and it really doesn't matter anymore.

We've been working through some trust and communication issues lately.  For the first time in our marriage, but it's pretty vanilla and communication about it has always been awkward and uncomfortable, so we've included it a couple of times in the talks we've been having.

A week ago, and said that I think she ought to try it (it feels good, gets you more comfortable with your own body, helps you figure out what you like, I think it's hot, etc.).  She replied that she'd #never# be comfortable enough to even try it, that it just seems “weird”, and tried to explain a great insight I'd read here about how masturbation is different from sex.  She said she just can't understand why a person would want to do that to themselves.  She was so convincing in her words and so completely uncomfortable with even the idea of masturbation that I began to believe her statement that she's never even contemplated doing it.  The conversation wound down and we went to bed.

The next morning I started thinking about it.  I started thinking that maybe I #was# imagining it all again, about how unquestionable what I witnessed on several nights was, though.  I started to wonder if maybe I'm going crazy and I hallucinated things.  I haven't noticed anything other than a little feeling around since that night, and by yesterday I was mostly convinced that it was all in my imagination.

Last night, and shortly afterward she rolled over and proceeded to go to town.  There's absolutely no doubt as to what transpired; her breathing, soft moaning, the bed shaking, the occasional shlick sound, the final frenzy as she finished, etc.  There is no doubt in my mind what I witnessed.  I was unable to fall asleep afterward

The way I see it

I know I need to talk to her, and I desperately need some outside perspectives.  Why would a person lie about something like this, especially when it hasn't even come up?  How can I get over my trust issues when she's lying to the extent that it's making me question my sanity?  Or does it even matter?  Am I blowing this whole thing out of proportion?  Or maybe I am losing my mind...in that case, what the fuck do I do next?

**UPDATE**

I didn't have class today so I decided to stay home for another day before heading back to college. I used some of the constructive criticism I received here as well as my understanding of my mom's thinking to have a chat with her this afternoon. I realized it was unrealistic for me to expect her to change anything as long as the issue stood between my friends and I so I just wanted to have an open dialogue and see what she thought. And the talk went great.

I opened the conversation jokingly with how my friends think my mom is attractive. She laughed and said she noticed with the occasional glances she got. I immediately asked her if that bothered her and if she wanted me to set those guys straight. She said no it's fine. It's flattering but weird at the same time. She reminded me her appearance wasn't for them or anyone else, she's what matters to me. It was at that very moment where I came to a realization that I wasn't embarrassed of my mom's assets in front of my friends. I was just being really *overprotective.* 

I told her I'm going to talk to the guys and tell them to stop or at least minimize that stuff in front of her like she wanted. She told me I didn't have to and that it was no big deal. She said she'd playfully and jokingly bring it up one day and try that. I told her not to worry about my friendships with them

Thanks to all the guys who PM'd me to walk me through my thoughts and plan. You guys were awesome. Thanks to the people who disagreed and respectfully provided your opinion on the matter; it was nice to see another point of view on how I was looking at the issue. And I apologize to the number of people who felt the need to tell me to go kill myself or wished that my mother aborted me so that she didn't have to deal with me and things of that nature. While your messages were a little disheartening and I can't say why my issue would merit those actions

When she moved into her own apartment two years ago she started gaining weight - she wasn't making healthy meals, which makes you crave unhealthy food.

As of 4 months ago she'd probably gained 70-80lbs. I tried dropping subtle hints for her to eat healthier, and that I was concerned for her health. I found her very unattractive physically at this point, but didn't say that for obvious reasons. 

I started making her healthier lunches to take to work, biking, gym, etc. She hasn't lost any weight with all this stuff, but she hasn't really gained anymore either. 

Today she was cleaning out her car and I saw her stuffing a bunch of fast food bags/wrappers into a garbage bag. I decided to do some sleuthing and looked at her last bank statement

1372799639.0,1hiui9,[Infidelity] My [28M] life has been shit since I found out my wife [26F] of 6 years cheated on me,throwaway29901,271,58,183,"Some background:

Met my wife when she was 18 in college. We immediately fell in love with each other and we shared lots of things and goals in common. We dated for 4 years until she was out of college and I had a decent paying job. She was 22

During 3 of these 4 years we lived together. I transferred jobs closer to where she wanted to go for grad school (it was fairly easy for me and the company helped with everything so I didn't think it twice) and we moved into a much nicer apartment. I kept working and moving up in my job while she went to school exclusively. Our first and only daughter is turning two this week. 

Our sex life had up to now been amazing. Slowed down because of our daughter and how taxing a kid is

The problem:

3 months ago I found out she cheated on me. It happened during October 2012. She went out for a conference with another two classmates

She confessed to me after reading the letter I wrote her for her birthday. She called me on the phone from work crying asking me to go home. I thought something was wrong with our daughter but she was just freaking out and I couldn't understand anything so I immediately drove to our place. 

She broke down and told me she had cheated on me and how much of a piece of shit she was. I drove off for about two hours. I came back and asked for every single detail. We spent 3 hours going over it. She told her version and then I asked every single question I could think of (which just broke my heart more).

I left the house and took the vacation time I had earned so far from work (3 weeks) and pretty much drowned myself in alcohol for 2 of those weeks until my older brother

I pulled my shit together and called my wife. I told her I wanted to work it out for our daughter.

It's been 2 months since I came back home after saying I had forgiven her and wanted to work it out so that everything would go back to the way it was... I am doing worse every week at job. Have trouble keeping up with what I have to do. 

I do not trust my wife at all

Our sex life is shit. We haven't had sex since I found that out. We've tried several times... I lose my erection every time. I just look at her and can see nothing but her being fucked by someone else. My mind goes through every single detail I squeezed off of her during those 3 hours we talked about it. I feel like I can't have sex with her again. 

I reached my worst today. I went into the shower this morning and masturbated. I started thinking of my wife and this guy and I couldn't stop. I was angry and I jerked my dick until it hurt and I came. I immediately started crying and felt disgusted at her

I just can't forgive her.

I wake up every morning and kiss her like I used to. I make breakfast for her and our daughter. I put up this fucking smile and act all like I used to before this. Then I get on my car

I come back home at 6

We go out on weekends on our own or with her sister and her children and I put up my ""everything's fine"" face when I really just want to drink until I die. I don't want to be separated from my daughter

Every minute of every day my only thought is her being fucked by someone else. I am going crazy.

If anyone can offer any advice on how to forgive infidelity and move on

**tl;dr**: Had an apparently perfect life. Wife cheated on me. Alcoholic urges resurged, I wouldn't stand being separated from my daughter.

**Update as of June 3rd:** Thank you everyone for your advice. Will try to address each comment individually, specially when we're talking about a family here. I love my wife very much, regardless of what she did. I can't forgive her right now but I want to. I have a daughter with her and I don't want to become a weekend dad. I've taken care of her everyday since she was born and I don't want that to change. She is the most important person in my life, besides my wife, and I don't want to see her only 2 days a week, if not less. If you can't respect that, I beg you not to comment. I understand some people think differently but the way some of you talk about it is just plain disrespectful. I don't mind hearing the opposing side as long as it's expressed in a respectful way.

We first got together in early January. She is also pregnant with my child and unwilling to consider an abortion.

Emily says she was diagnosed by a psychiatrist with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). I only have a B.S. in Psychology, she certainly fits the bill.

She has extreme body issues. She was burned in a house fire at age 15 and has some scaring on her arms. She even wears sweaters or hoodies during the Summer.

During sex, butt, or her vagina. No fingering and no oral sex. Just vaginal sex with no touching. She has even told me that I won't be allowed in the delivery room when the baby is born because I might see something. 

Early in the relationship, went down on her, fingered her, even had anal sex. She looked great. Everything was fine. I've seen it all and it only made me love her more. 

I've always been a big believer in The Five Love Languages (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Five_Love_Languages). Out of the different ways of expressing love

I crave her physically. I want to touch her. I wouldn't even care if I couldn't see anything --- as long as I could touch

It even gets so bad that she won't let me watch a movie if it has any nudity or sexuality in it. She thinks that if I see nudity on TV

It gets so bad that she never wants to have sex. She has never initiated sex with me. I almost have to beg her or have to sell her on it. I feel like I'm attractive and physically fit. I'm a former U.S. Marine and I cage fight professionally

I have personally spoken to a therapist while in this relationship. I went through therapy a while back. I have a high opinion of it and I think she could get past this if she would make an effort. I have even offered to pay for the therapy sessions

Our relationship isn't that great to begin with. She constantly accuses me of cheating on her. Her BPD has also hurt her in other ways

All of the other bullshit I think I can handle. The cheating accusations, etc. I don't like any of it, but I like her so much that I think it's worth it. But I just can't NOT touch her. When I kiss her legs and get a scent of her vagina, it makes me get crazy horny. It is very frustrating for her to constantly reject me when the desire is so strong for me.

I know its a fast update but I couldn't sit on this any longer.

Recently I was helping my parents with doing a bit of late spring cleaning and throwing a lot of old rubbish out when I cam across what I assume is the most recent copy of their will (date June 2012). I didn't mean to look at it but am I moved it I noticed in the 'beneficiaries' section on the front only my sister was listed. Then (I know it was horrible of me to do) I decided to have a read through it.

I'm not in it, life insurance policies, savings, car, absolutely everything. They aren't rich people by any means but due to the way property prices have risen since they bought their house in the 80s this probably comes in total to about £500k.

They have always had a thing with favouring my sister a bit more than me giving her extra attention and stuff but I've never really minded. She is a bit of a screw up and if I'm honest she has needed the extra attention. I'm not going to lie either my financial situation is a lot better than my parents

Obviously this is all hypothtical as they are both perfectly healthy and have a long time in them yet. it just seems harsh that if they were to die tommorow my sister would be set whilst I would be left with nothing.

Am I right to be angry about this? Should I confront them about it or not? I know its not my money at all but she is a terrible daughter to them. Over the years she has lied to them, help them out whenever they asked, went to University which they had always wanted me to do (I paid for it 100% myself with no help) and it just seems like they are punishing me and rewarding her for being such a failure.

Additional info: With me they have always had a parenting style of letting me make my own way

Backstory: I am 22 years old and have been dating my 20 year old gf for about 2.5 years.  We met randomly at a concert and had a long distance relationship for about a year until she transferred to my school.  We fell in love very quickly and have fought very little

About a year ago, just using her computer, and it was right there) from an old high school ""friend"" that among other things, said that she loved him and couldnt wait to see him and that they were soul mates. She claims she never physically cheated and that she was just being nice to this guy who is depressed or something, but she never even mentioned this person, and they were probably spending a lot of time together when she went back to her hometown where he lived.  I was crushed that she lied to me and i nearly broke up with her, but i love her and im a sucker and forgave her after she insisted nothing happened besides saying that stuff. I still think something happened and she is lying to me about it because I dont have any further proof. Our relationship bounced back a bit after that

Now (about a year after this event) I caught her snooping in my email addresses. She went through 3 different addresses, and apparently was looking for something. For the record, I have not been cheating or acting suspicious or anything and i have nothing to hide. I confronted her about it and she lied and denied it repeatedly, saying that she just signed me out of my email to check her own. I told her that i have my internet history saved and proof that she did it, and she finally admitted to it. after some more prodding, she admitted to going through my emails and my phone/texts many times over the past year.  She said she has no reason to be suspicious and that its nothing I did, but said that she did this because she's insecure and and depressed and anxious that I am going to break up with her or something. Basically

She invaded my privacy, I could be more forgiving. But she had that ""emotional affair"", has lied to me before, and lost my trust.  

So Reddit, but I also can't be treated like this and I can't be lied to.  Who knows what else she has led to me about, especially the ""affair"" with her high school ""friend"". I think shes projecting her own infidelity and suspicious behavior on me.  Ladies and gentlemen of Reddit, can you help?

To recap

My ex began speaking to me throughout the day yesterday, ""Are you going out?"" I told him I was, he just nodded and calmly went back to his game. When I got back home around 3am, I popped my head into his office to see what was up, and they were still playing games and laughing/drinking. He said, ""How'd it go?"" I smiled and told him it went really well. He nodded again and went back to what he was doing. 

He knows that I was out with someone else

The date went amazingly well and I had a blast. This guy had no problem at all vocalizing his appreciation for my appearance, he made sure to somehow contact me before he left the company. I'm seeing him again later today, and I think that everything is going to be okay. 

Thank you to those of you who told me that what I was doing was okay. It meant so much more to me than you guys know. 

**tl;dr:** I think everything is going to work out and I appreciate everyone's support so much. 



**Edit**: Thanks to everyone for the support

Additionally, I am having fun, and in no way am I rubbing this in my ex's face. If he wants to know details then he'll ask. If he has an issue with any aspect of this situation, I've given him numerous chances to voice it. He's said nothing, his behavior has not changed, and he seems totally unfazed by it.

Dad just had open heart surgery last night.  He is the type of person who gives an all-encompassing ""I'm sorry"" and expect you to instantly forgive him no matter what he's done.  I have nothing in common with him except a past I'd rather forget.  He doesn't fail to disappoint me.  I expect him to die relatively soon and I don't know what to say to him.  

My dad was in his mid 30s when I was born and my mom was 19.  My dad met my future mother when he was visiting my grandmother in Colombia.  My dad had moved to the United States to go to college and was at this point a successful engineer.  My dad is deeply religious and was friends with the pastor of the biggest church in his hometown. My mom was at this church the Sunday he was in town.  My dad found her attractive and told her that ""the Lord spoke to me and said that you would be the mother of my children.""  My mother was a simple woman from a small town in the mountains.  Even her mother believed my dad's story and told her that ""if he said it's the Lord's will

She moved in with my dad in the United States.  He beat my mother on their wedding day because she asked her sister's husband to unclasp the top of her gown.  He took her paychecks and made her ask permission for anything she wanted to buy.  My mother said she needed time away to think if she wanted to stay married.  My dad bought her the plane ticket to Colombia to stay with her mom.  Concurrently

He knew she would be gone long enough to wait out the minimum amount of time to legally consider it abandoning the household.  He left his job and we spent my childhood living in one bedroom apartments all across the country.  

My dad was not a legal resident at the time and had difficulty finding another engineering job.  I remember him coming home in fast food uniforms.  He always worked two jobs.  I was home alone a lot after school.  He would leave me dinner already prepared in the microwave with instructions on a piece of paper next to the stove.  I remember coming home to an apology from him on the answering machine of why he couldn't be there on my birthday.  I didn't have a stable set of friends growing up because we were constantly on the move to avoid being found by my mom and to continue my dad's job search.

When my dad and I weren't doing too well

I couldn't tell on him because I didn't want to cause a fight between my dad and uncle Frank since we had no other place to live.  That continued for a year and then my dad finally found a stable job. 

I grew up being heavily indoctrinated.  My dad is an ordained minister at a Pentecostal church.  As a teenager

I graduated early from both high school and college and am now making more money than anyone in my family has ever made.  I wasn't religious so much as I was scared straight.  I didn't lose my virginity until I was 19 because I was so terrified of God's wrath.  

The God I grew up with was a scary

My paternal grandmother had 9 kids and they all live in the town I spent the majority of my life in.  I would see my uncles

I moved across the country with my girlfriend for a job when I was 21.  It worked out well because I could still keep in contact with my dad without having to deal with his cynical disapproval of my friends, she said she didn't love me anymore and left that same day.  I was saving up for an engagement ring.

I didn't sleep for three days straight.  I was useless at work.  On that third day

I shut myself off from society.  I drank every night for months.  I gained about 30 pounds and had tried to vindicate my own existence by progressing at what I was good at: playing music.  As ridiculous as it may sound to some of you

At a certain point, I decided I needed to get a fresh start somewhere.  

I moved to a major city because it was a well-known music town.  The only family I had in this city was my cousin Roger that I lived with growing up.  He was now married and had a daughter.  He also played in bands and said he wanted to start a project with me.  He seemed well-adjusted and friendly so I put our past behind us.  

He initially struck me as a stoner archetype who liked a lot of the same music as I did.  For some reason, was awesome.  She (let's say Amy) sung in our band and we always seemed to be on the same page.  Early on, our drummer asked me in confidence if I noticed that Amy acts differently whenever Roger isn't around.  After it was pointed out, I could only see her as two different people: the person she was around him and her normal self.  She acted timid and fairly quiet when he was around and was optimistic, confident and outgoing whenever he wasn't.  

She told the drummer and I less than a month after I moved here that she'd be leaving my cousin.  I stopped hanging out with him after he began to suspect me of having an affair with his wife.  After she left him

Amy was exactly the friend I needed at the time and vice versa.  I had learn how to cope with what was done to me by logically and objectively examining my life and figuring out ways of improving my situation.  The problem was that I was too far gone to where I shut myself off emotionally.  I noticed myself forgetting my past.  I wasn't attracted to women anymore.  My existence seemed inconsequential to me because I had lost my footing in life.  I felt like an active observer gazing into real life and acted like what I determined a rational (normal) person would.

Amy had an optimism about her that was contagious.  She was the kind of person that would stop what she's doing to point out the birds chirping, ate prepackaged microwaveable food and slept through most of the daylight hours.  She was exactly what I needed to make me learn how to enjoy life again.  I was the logical perspective she needed to make necessary changes to her life.  

We grew closer and closer together until it happened.  You don't get to choose who you fall in love with but when it happens, you know it's broken the moment it snaps.  We decided we couldn't see each other not being a part of each other's life.  She felt guilty since Roger was still grieving the end of his marriage and I was his cousin. I felt bad since I knew this would mean losing a lot of family members.  It would, to them, confirm my cousin Roger's story that I had an affair with his wife which caused their marriage to end.

My dad heard about Roger's accusations from my uncle Frank.  He called me up to scold me

I haven't seen my family or visited since the accusations started almost a year ago.  I finally came out to a different cousin  (let’s say Jane) about Amy and I being together and explained the circumstances.  She said that she loves me no matter what and knows me well enough to know I wouldn't ruin a marriage.  

I would like to be honest about why I'm with Amy.  It's not out of revenge or opportunity.  It's not about sending a message.  Before my ex left me

Now

My uncle Frank has badmouthed me to the point where his story isn’t even based off of true events.  He said that Amy is scared to be alone and I took advantage of the situation.  Amy and I plan on moving in together this year.  She is my best friend and we see each other every day.  She is my favorite person I’ve ever met.

I haven’t talked to my dad since last year.  I got two calls from him yesterday which I didn’t answer.  I had talked to Jane the day before and guessed that she must have said something to him.  After texting her back and forth

I stopped talking to him since he didn’t even want to hear my side of the story involving Amy and has refused to get treatment.  He’ll be in the ICU for another 24 hours.  Should I make the long drive to go see him?  If I do visit

I was robbed of the opportunity of saying a few last words to my father, “I don’t know where I went wrong in raising you.”  

Does this man deserve to be a part of my life?  Should I accept his forgiveness although I know he’s only doing it so that I won’t be upset with him anymore?

**EDIT:** I've gotten a few comments questioning how exactly my father has disappointed me.

-My dad denied me the opportunity to have my mother in my life and told me she abandoned me.  My mother was only a legal resident because of my dad.  When they divorced

-He told me he was letting himself die of cancer because of a vivid dream he thinks is prophetic. My younger half sister is still in high school and my stepmother doesn't work. He is being selfish by letting himself die because he has an obligation to his family.

-If your son murdered someone, he said that I confessed to him that we were together. He completely sold me out and sided with his brother.  I'm not suggesting he had to agree with my actions but he could have said ""I don't know.""  

-He's owed me $10k for over a year now (I helped him with the down payment on his new house).  He's spent more than that decorating his house over the last year. Hasn't paid me back

-When I used to visit

Bottom line: He wants me to be in his life but only on his terms.  Refuses to acknowledge any wrongdoing.  Believes himself to be a saint since he's the pastor of a church.  I don't want him to be a part of my life but I don't want to feel guilty when he passes.

Get up at about 7 (whenever my 2-year old decides to get up), my own needs, do laundry, clean up kitchen, watch son until I need to go to work, work my 11-3:30 shift on my feet (running around nonstop, no breaks), start taking care of my son again, and he usually won't go to sleep without a fight until 10...and by then I am falling asleep with him.  

My point is, most nights.  

The weekends are much the same, and I take care of him most of the time.  

I also am ""expected"" to take care all of the finances (which is tricky because we were in a mess of a debt and I have been working my ass off trying to figure out things we can cut, take care of my son 90% of the time (change diapers, make sure he has eaten, baths, clothed, etc), take care of the dog (which is kind of just annoying), clean up after everyone

What I expect of my husband at the very least:  Take out the garbage.  

So, he wanted a blowjob, and I had every intention of doing it (and he actually helped out with cleaning up the house a bit yesterday), but I was exhausted at 10 pm...right when my son goes to bed...and he was pissed. 

I know he is frustrated because it's been this way for almost 3 years now (ever since I got pregnant), an eating disorder, and dealing with the death of my dad, and being the personal rep for his estate...  I am completely emotionally drained right now.

Where do I begin with him????  I need help, so...otherwise we probably would have had sex, maybe.)

TL;DR:  My husband expects me to do everything around the house, and we have a son that I take care of 90% of the time.  Hubby gets mad when he doesn't get a blowjob because I am so exhausted at the end of the day.  What can I do??

While we're not hard for money, I believe it bothers him that he works full time at a job he dislikes while I stay home (we agreed that I will stay home until our daughter ,4, it feels mechanical and simply for the sake of getting it out of the way.

We now live together in an in-law style apartment in her parent's house (fairly private, she said that she wanted to wait to have sex until marriage so that it would be more special. I was/am okay with this.

We have had some sexual contact (oral, maybe once or twice a month), but I was always the one to initiate. I truly love this girl but she is terrified/ashamed of sexuality, or she just hates it. She has never had an orgasm despite my VERY enthusiastic attempts, and I think it is because she doesn't have her mind 'in the game'. She recently told me that she may never want to have sex, even when we are married. She has never masturbated and any discussions of our sexual relationship end in her getting upset, changing the subject

I'm a very affectionate, but it just doesn't happen often. We cuddle, hold each other, and kiss, but that doesn't fulfill my needs. I was perfectly fine with waiting when I thought our relationship would eventually have a sexual element. Now that that may not happen, it has totally changed my outlook on waiting. I guess it isn't waiting if the thing you're waiting for never happens.

Now I'm starting to get depressed because I feel unattractive and undesired. On top of all that

TL:DR; Been with a girl for 3 years. I love her more than anything. Waiting until marriage for sex. She says she may never want sex. Suddenly, reddit. Just typing this out has helped me feel better.

This is a throwaway because paranoia.

Edit1: Her parents often make snarky remarks about her appearance/weight

Edit2 ***UPDATE***:  I wrote her a letter and told her, but soon, when she is comfortable.  She didn't bring it up but hopefully she will soon.  If i have to press the issue again, I will. In the meantime, i'm going to try to help her realize that it is okay to be sexual and there is no shame in it.  

I believe there are three potential issues: Self Confidence, or if she is truly asexual/not interested.   I am not totally sure how to tackle each of these issues, but I have some plans.

In order to get her over any 'shame' she may feel

To help her get over her fear of pregnancy, many people have mentioned that her low sex drive could be a result of hormone levels.  Any advice on how to bring this up without her saying ""I am who I am.""?

Hello again everyone.

I just thought I would post a quick update.

On Friday the court reporters came back with a report after speaking to Tom and I. Their police checks show that I have a complete clean bill and his has 4 occasions of being in trouble with the police for alcohol related offenses. Other than the DUI

My SO went to court today for the initial hearing. Tom didn't turn up. His solicitors had written to court asking for an adjournment because he was in hospital but I happened to know that 1) This was down to a liver problems (ahem) and 2) That he was already out and had been working hard at the gym so had no reason not to be there. I explained this to the court.

Judge was not impressed with him.

I gave the judge some brief details and I could see her mind cogs turning. She ordered no contact for Tom until this is heard in a months time. In the mean time he has to provide medical evidence of  the reasons for his hospitalization. She also said that if he didn't turn up for the relisting she would make a final order stating no contact.

So even without be giving statements and providing evidence

I am going to go 100% for no contact without compromise. This is what we hope for but I don't have a feel for the final outcome as it is early days. If we get it, softest bear we can find :)

I have changed names to protect anonymity as this is obviously a delicate legal matter. Therefore

Thank you for everyone's kind support. Keep your paws crossed for us!

**tl;dr We had the preliminary hearing and the forecast is looking good**

The first month of our relationship I thought we got over her insecurity about her height.

Of course when we've gone out I've heard comments from men and women but it's never really bothered me. I've just attributed it to them being jealous or being assholes.

But last week I over heard her talking to her friend on the phone about how she didn't like our photos together and was embarrassed because of the height difference.

I never really cared till now. It really hurt to hear that somebody that you love is ashamed to be seen with you. She knows that I know what she said and i've been kind of a dick to her since then. For example she's a ""pro"" volleyball player and I go to all her games but skipped the last one and when she came home and asked why I didn't go I told her I didn't want to embarrass her and then we started arguing again.

How do I get over what she said? Or should I even get over it? Should I just move on?

I'll update when I stop for the night

----------------------------------------------------

My apologies if this turns rambling

I moved across the country a month ago to be with my long distance boyfriend--we've been together a year, screaming, throwing things, even self-harming.  He says that this only ever happens with me, and no one else in his life affects him that way--he also says that he once had a very severe temper and has worked very hard to fix that, and he can't let me destroy that.  Every time we've had a fight that ended like this, he's convinced me that I have an anger problem and need to get help--when I point out that it's him freaking out

Last night he got a text from a girl he once fucked, I didn't go searching through his phone or anything out of line.  I jokingly said I'd text her back that he was too busy having sex with his girlfriend, and playfully grabbed his phone.  He thought I was serious and took the phone back.  He said that he was going to tell her that he couldn't go because it was late on a school night...I know I shouldn't have even asked, but I did anyway.  I asked him if he was going to even mention me to this girl, and he reacted like I was insane.  Long story short, I said that I thought it wasn't asking much to just give her a gentle reminder, just in case she had any ideas--he said that I was crazy and jealous and possessive and crossing a very clear line to him.  

I went outside and tried to clear my head for a bit, and I would have to take the blame for it.  I came back after a few minutes, and told him I was going to go out, maybe wander around the grocery store for a bit.  He told me not to go, he wanted to talk.  He then proceeded to dissect my feelings, basically telling me that my feelings are my own and he isn't going to treat people ""badly"" because I want him to.  He went on and on about the boundaries that he has set in order to have a healthy relationship with me; he'll be happy to discuss my feelings in a calm rational way, but he won't open a door that will surely lead to me telling him who he can or can't see and when and where and why (nevermind the fact that I've never tried to do anything like it, the thought of just re-establishing a boundary with this random girl is heinous to him

He then proceeded to dissect everything I was saying about why it hurt that this seemed to be such a huge problem for him, drawing comparisons to atheist vs. Christian arguments, and basically giving me a debate critique.  It would have been funny if it wasn't so painful--I was telling him that I felt like he was ridiculing my feelings, and he retorts by ridiculing my feelings.  He had this smile on his face the whole time that was killing me.  

I finally had enough and told him, more mature person by throwing around your knowledge of ad hominem attacks and straw man arguments and telling me why what I feel is wrong, but you're not.  You're just hurting me.""

He then looked at me, amongst other horrible things, he threw his computer onto the bed, punched his bookshelf repeatedly, and started packing his stuff to stay with his mother for a few nights.  I didn't even know what to say, I was scared shitless.  Every so often, he would seem to calm down and start to argue again--when I would answer him

In the course of calling me every horrible name he could think of, he took an armful of textbooks and threw them at me.  They hit the wall six inches to the left of me, nearly hitting my cat in the process as well.  I couldn't even move.  Several times he got near me, with this look in his eyes...I still don't think he would hit me, but I can tell he wanted to.  And through the whole thing, he kept screaming about how I was doing this to him, how I was making him this angry.  

Finally, that I had started a shouting match.  I hadn't so much as raised my voice once, and I said so.  He laughed and said, ""See, she won't stop, she's so aggressive.  You know how hard I've worked to keep my anger under control and she doesn't care, she is just fighting and fighting and fighting with me and won't stop it.""  When I looked at him and asked him if he was really doing this, of course he was.  

I ended up leaving the room, obviously, and grabbed me by the shoulders--she was almost sure he had hit me.  She also asked why I had let him talk to me that way.  I still don't have an answer.

He came out about ten minutes later, about 15 minutes prior, called me a fucking bitch, kicked me out, and thrown a stack of books at my fucking head.  ""I didn't throw them AT you, I just lost it.""  

I told him to go and I haven't seen him since.  

Now I'm sitting in his room, his best friend, everyone who has heard even the beginning of this story has told me I need to get out and never come back.  But even after 24 hours apart, I already miss him.  He still believes that this is all my fault, of course.  

I keep thinking about what happened, and going over and over to see if it really was as bad as I thought at the time.  I know he has anger problems (though he swears I'm the one with the problem) but I knew that going in--I feel like a failure, and I'm so ashamed of myself.  

I don't know if I should leave, or if it would even do any good.  I've never felt this way in my whole life, and if there's anything anyone can tell me, or any hope anyone can give me, I need it now more than ever.

Not sure if anyone remembers any of this but I feel obligated to update for the last time about this. 

Me (M27)

Things are working. My god we've put in a lot of work, but we've done it. We've both grown a lot from this. It's been a lot of hard work on my end to change some aspects about myself, and she's been doing the same. 

In the past, and I didn't like that. Well what I've learned is that when I bottled it up, she was bottling up her frustration from me doing that, and in the end making things worse regardless of me saying something or not. Now I'm up front and honest when I think something is stupid, or irrational, or a good idea, or anything else. This has been a huge help. I've learned to pay attention more instead of just drifting away in to the couch every night because I was tired from work. 

Now I can let her know, I worked hard and I don't want to do anything. Lets just spend some time together."" and this works out well most of the time. Sometimes she gets a fire under her ass to get shit done when she gets home, and I've had to let her know, that just because she wants to do chores or something, doesn't mean I want to. We dedicate those ""get shit done"" times for the weekend when we have a free day, then I gladly help out with projects around the house. I also learned to put my foot down when I really don't want to do something and just tell her no, she needs to learn to do that herself because I don't want to spend my free time working on her projects for her all the time.

She has improved a lot on the whole family time thing. During Christmas, and tried to dedicate spending 85% of Christmas day with her family, AFTER we had already come up with a time schedule that we agreed on. I called her out on her attempt to change it all, and she really put up a fight about it. I stood my ground, and we both got our way. We divided our time evenly among the three families and had a great Christmas. She said she liked how it all worked out too. 

I think what sparked her attempt the most was that her mom took on 2 part time jobs to help pay for the second house they bought (that's it's own disaster story), her mom really laid on the guilt about ""but who else will make the food?! What will we all be eating?! I need you to be at Nana's to cook this year or there won't be anything!"". My wife indulged in it for a bit, and when I caught wind of it, I put an end to it right away. If 25 people can't team together to make a fucking meal, then guess what, we're all going to ave cheese and crackers for Christmas, everyone needs to pitch in or not bitch about it. The end. It all went fine in the end. My wife didn't realize how relieved she was to not have to cook the dinner until she didn't do it. 

So back on topic, and that we're going to be ok this time around, and hopefully the rest of the time too. Big thanks to all of you that responded with really genuinely helpful responses. I don't really know what else to say about it so if I left anything out, just let me know!

Thanks for all the advice. After thinking it all over

C. and I had a long talk last night and I explained that despite my past and my initial plans for this vacation I was definitely not going to sleep with anyone else on this trip whether we had made things official or not.

She said that it's hard for her

Eventually

Then we made out on the couch for like an hour. Things were getting pretty heavy when my sister came home. (Sidenote: I know C. because she is my sister's friend and roommate.) It was pretty late at this point so she said I could sleep over in her bed -but just sleep. The whole ""just sleeping"" thing lasted about half an hour.

I guess that's what you'd call a happy ending. I got a girlfriend, and then I can come home and continue to get laid.

The only bad thing was this morning my sister told me that C. and I needed to stay at my place when we sleep together because she's traumatized for life after hearing her brother have sex with her best friend. I asked her why she didn't bang on the wall  or something and she said she didn't want to ruin our first time together so she just put on headphones. She's a good sister.

I want to thank everyone for their advice. You all helped me to think through this issue.

I took time last night to sit down with my gf and talk with her about our sex life. I started off pretty general in terms of how she’s liked being more open in the bedroom. We both agreed that it’s been on the whole a good experience.

I steered the conversation towards her interracial fetish, I just let her talk about it. I learned there were two big reasons she’s become so interested in this fetish.

The first was something I didn’t know about her college days. She said her close group of friends went through a phase early on in college when they all (except my gf) dated black men pretty frequently. They mostly all left for college with bfs and when the relationship ended

They had a mini renunion a while back and I guess her friends got talking about how the sex they had during this phase was the best in their life. She said they talked about how it felt very transgressive and that many of them “didn’t feel like they were women” until they had that experience. The way she described it, she girls all treat this phase in their life a dirty secret, but nevertheless a transformational part of their sexual histories. (Many of them, including my gf come from small towns originally).

The second reason was one I was expecting- her kind of nutty friend. Like I mentioned earlier, and other very racial terms seems to come from). She talks about it a lot when they hang out together and I guess my gf has become interested.

I said I was glad we’ve been so open with eachother, and that sex with black men changed them. She also said while she can understand how some of the terms look racist from the outside, she’s doing something her other friend does with her bf, and he’s the one who’s driving their sex life.

Every time I tried to point out that while this might be her friends experience, but her friend’s actual experiences.

Ok. Fuck. So we’re not getting anywhere. I explained why I wasn’t comfortable with this. I tried to ask her what our other black friends would think about this. She didn’t have much to say to that.

I wanted my relationship to go slow and step by step with my mother after all 15 years is a long time. My mother is completely obsessed with me and understandable she lost me for a very long time. Our relationship worked fine due to distance. We had a bit of a misunderstanding about phone calls. I would call her once every other week for a nice chat


Anyway my mother ran into issues where she was living and had to go move in with some family on her side as a roommate


She came two days later totally unexpected, make all the calls, setup the appointments, get the paperwork, etc. 


We did it at first just to show we care, unaccommodating, and complainers. We have basically been feeding her since she came out here, and even bought her a phone card for her cell phone. We did everything we could within our free time to help her.


Well three days ago I took her to lunch before work, yes she can nag but all people do and it's not constant or anything and some of it is well deserved. I like to keep a line of peace, and I just told her you know that's my future wife and I love her flaws and all, just like she loves me flaws and all. I said I respect your opinion but please keep it to yourself, now lets enjoy our lunch. I think most people would have turned the car around and said GTFO at this point and believe me I wanted to but I didn't want to think she was petty like that with some bs matriarchal jealousy. Especially since my fiancee adores my mother and wants to be her best friend. Also did I mention my fiancee is the main reason we reunited she pushed me to do it and held my hand the entire way.


Well yesterday morning on our day off which the past two weeks have been go go go, and then meetup with friends for a double date and board game night. My mother calls at 9am while we were still sleeping in and my fiancee picks up and she just goes on a rampage against my fiancee, accusing her of being a two faced bitch, blocking her son from her, not helping her find an apartment, shes gone hungry, and we are not giving her the time of day. As I said my fiancee is very sweet so this shocked her as she didn't see it coming and she was reduced to a sobbing mess. I grabbed the phone and told my mother that was completely uncalled for and you owe her an apology do you not respect our space? My mother hung up on me.


I went to the room and left my fiancee out in the car as she is not very confrontational and it's my mom so I will take it from here. I was stern and civil, we have asked you respectfully a handful of times to respect our space, we have fed you, and given you things you needed, we have helped you apartment hunt, and you spat in our faces and tried to drive a wedge between us. You also made up lies about my fiancees family and put words in their mouths and tried to turn us against them. Today you have lost your son again, and I want you take your forked tongue with you and out of our lives. I now understand why nobody wants you around or living with them. 


She got super upset of course and she agreed to leave


My heart is broken, disrespected, and cheated. Please tell me I did the right thing here. Also I just want to say before anybody brings it up she has not lost her son permanently but for right now I am not going to have any contact with her right now I need some time. However when the time is right I will allow a slow paced long distance relationship with her again, after all you only have one mother.

My boyfriend is very philosophical. He believes that he gains so much knowledge and ideas just from being alone. Right now he is going through a phase where he feels that being in a relationship is stopping him from growing into a better person

He says that he wants time to be single before he settles down. Not to be with anyone else but to just be alone before he starts that chapter in his life. He wants to travel and learn a lot more about the world

He thought of this ""great idea"" to break up then set a date to get back together then get married 6 months later. I automatically said that that was ridiculous and I can't guarantee that I won't move on. I feel that he won't ever be ready to settle down unless he has his space but I'm not comfortable with his idea. I figured I would ask Reddit their opinion and see if anyone has gone through this before.

What would you do if you were in this situation?

EDIT: Hey guys

EDIT: I have read each and everyone of your advice and it has helped. I did some thinking of my own and brought to his attention a couple things. For one

I brought these things up and told him that I think there is a deeper reason. That he wants to take time apart to see if I am the one he wants to be with. Not just to be by himself but to make sure I am what he wants. He broke down and said that he does feel like he is less attracted to me because he really wants me to achieve my goals. He wants me to go after things I want and really show that initiative. He finds it so attractive.

I want to be this type of person so it didn't hurt my feelings. It was nice to hear the truth. It made him really excited when I told him that I am going to start trying to achieve everything I set out to do. I hope that talking with him has helped our relationship and that he will start being more honest!

So, the other half telling me she's shady and she's most likely cheating on me.

To address the latter, but we live together and like I said, she knows for a fact that if she crosses that line, we're done.  She's brutally honest and up front with me and thus, let's just accept that she's not cheating on me and move on.

As far as the main issue at hand.  I talked to her about it, ""Ok, let's say that I cheated on you.  Let's then say that I asked the girl on the side if she can help me pick out a jewelry for you.  How would you feel?""  Then a lightbulb went off in her head.  

According to her, the consequences, etc.  We then had a LONG (3 - 4 hrs) conversation about this issue, and how horrible this action was.  She understood.  

We THEN talked about her best friend.  I told her up front that I think he's a huge asshole,"" and she didn't understand how that was shady.  I again, put it into context.  ""Let's say that I have a best female friend.  Let's say that she has never met you, my gf, and you have never met her, my best friend.  How would that make you feel?""  Then another light bulb.  ""That does sound really weird...do you think he wants to hook up with me again?""

At this point, but I flat out told her that I think that her best friend is a scumbag, and I have no respect for him.  I left it there.

All in all, she is very naive, brought up very conservatively, etc. but...jeez) or B) ...I don't know.  Do people like this exist?

My Wife and I have been together for 10.5 years, good sex life, pretty much the same goals, no money problems, and we wanted to spend the rest of our lives together.

As of November/December last year, booked her with a therapist and gave her some anti-depressants. Well, she only saw the therapist for 4 sessions (that was all that was initially booked) but the anti-depressants seemed to do the trick. In fact, not only did they make her feel normal again, but it knocked her sex drive into overtime!

So yesterday I was at home, as I know she wanted to take some anyway, but they were initially stored in Photobooth. However, one of them (of her in her bra, with some nipple showing) had been marked that it had been emailed. My curiosity was piqued. She can't have accidentally clicked ""email"" and then deleted the draft, as it said successfully emailed. She wouldn't try and save the draft for future, as it's saved on the Laptop.

Now, but with this anomaly, I had to check.

So, talked about a blowjob that she owed him (in joking terms, but made suspicious by the context). She said she was going on holiday with a female friend to Turkey, and when he asked for ""pictures"", he said that her friend wouldn't be happy with that.... but she'll send him pictures of her, but that he needs to send some of him to recipriocate.

This was not just a chat with a good friend that just went a little over the line, and she admitted that she isn't sure if she loves me any more, and she's felt like this since November/December. She did say, however, that when she feels like this, she doesn't have any love for anything (this is a symptom of depression) but I just..... I need to know how to get over this. I need to know how I can trust her again. I need to know how to stop torturing myself with the thought that if she wasn't so sloppy with covering her tracks, that she would have slept with another man.

What do I do?

Whilst I had always known she wasn't the most maternal person ever

I am from a big family (6 siblings)

Unfortunately

We are very much in love and it is heartbreaking to think that a relationship as good as this could be about to end. She has made the argument that it would be madness to throw such a good relationship away when it's possible I may only be looking to start a family in 10-15 years' time.

Having read every other similar thread in /r/relationships I know that a couple is incompatible if they cannot agree on what is probably the most important issue a couple will ever to make - whether to start a family together or not. Therefore I know the relationship must end at some point.

I suppose what I am looking for is advice from anyone who has been in a similar situation and has the benefit of hindsight

Is the best solution simply finishing it immediately? Is there something to be said for spending another month, but this is not the case here, we are both very happy together and have had an amazing time together. It is a horrible situation and has made us both very upset.

Where to start? My fiance (**F**24) and I (**M**25) have been together since 2005. We took each other's virginity after about a month in to our relationship.  The first couple years were amazing, the sex was almost every time we spent time together, which was practically every day.  

Then college started and our schedules got busier to where it got down to us seeing each other on the weekends.  I just blamed the lack of intimacy we were sharing to the lack of time we would spend together.


When she got a place of her own
I wouldn't have a problem if the initiation was the only issue; whenever I try to initiate sex, busy, headache, or the plain old not in the mood.*


Now I must say this about her before anybody makes any ditch the bitch comments: she is my best friend and the love of my life.  She is smart, has the most beautiful hair, and is possibly the most determined person I know.  We have been through a lot of ups and downs together (lots of crazy family issues for both of us)  We got engaged this past November, and we moved in together in a place by ourselves for the first time in February.  **I want to spend the rest of my life with this woman.**

So here is my dilemma: At this point in our relationship, she just was not in the mood.

I then proceeded to let her know that I have needs

Her response was to pull her panties down (we're laying in bed) faced away from me and said

This is where ~~I think~~ I messed up.

I took her up on her now obvious sarcastic offer.  We proceeded to have sex.  The worst sex we have ever had.  It honestly made me feel like I was using her body to masturbate with; it felt like she wasn't even in the room.  At one point I slowed down to try and kiss her, I just flipped her over and proceeded to finish from behind.

As soon as it was over, it was dawning on me that I had dome something terribly wrong.  She would not talk to me.  I did not understand. I still don't.

I went to work today, I felt that writing this all out may help in some way.  Our conversation ended with her going to the grocery store after calling me selfish.  I don't know what to do, and I don't have anybody I can talk to about this.

Well

Firstly I went to see a lawyer and he told me to get all evidence of these e-mails in case it came to divorce - evidence of her adultery will help me in court. He didn't advise me to use my children as pawns but he did say whatever happens I have to stay calm and he says he can get me joint custody of our children, which I can. 

I returned home and managed to get copies of e-mails from my wife's laptop. They've been printed off and are now in a file just in case. 

Next came confronting my wife. She arrived home on Wednesday, she told me she had extra work to take care of and I said, ""It hasn't got anything to do with (her colleague) then?"" She seemed slightly taken aback, asked me what I meant and I told her that I'd seen the e-mails, I know what's going on, I wanted to know why she did it. She began to cry, she didn't deny it

Apparently he made her feel safe, getaways in four star hotels (here was when I found out that when she had to go on weekend 'work trips' it was actually her going to a hotel with him). She felt free when she was with him, whereas with me she felt that she was trapped. She told me that marriage was such a permanent thing and that she wasn't keen on marrying me in the first place, that because her parents and friends liked me she felt pressured into doing it and that her affair was her way of escaping it. 

She told me she still loves me and that she still wants to be with me. She said the affair wasn't my fault in the slightest

I wasn't totally sure whether she was telling the truth and that she would end the affair so I told her I would forgive her and we would try to go back to where we were if I was there when she ended it with her colleague in person so I knew she'd definitely done it. 

She agreed and we are now set to try and get our marriage back on track. It will take time

She has set up a 'date' for Sunday evening at our house, I will be there and my wife will end it with him. 

I'd just like to say thank you so much Reddit for helping me

***TL;DR:*** My wife has apologised

**EDIT:** After browsing these comments, alarm bells are beginning to ring. Even though I still love my wife deeply, there's nothing to suggest she will be trustworthy with me. I have decided to do the following:

* Insist she quits her job. If she truly wants to end the affair

* Invite my friend over at the same time as when we meet her colleague, I wouldn't resort to violence upon meeting him knowing the consequences.

If she uneasy about either of these, I'm looking out for my kids. They are the ones who will suffer the most from this, not me, and I have decided that I'd rather end this marriage sooner rather than later.

So I probably should have updated everyone a lot sooner than this.

So here it goes:

No I did not sleep with someone else

When I had made that post M was away on a volunteering trip, because our dating anniversary was on the 30th of December. 

Well the shit hit the fan quickly. By mid-July we were fighting all the time over every little thing. We were spending less time with each other every week. Things were looking very bad.

We finally sat down and

So, and after a week or so I asked her if she wanted to make this work. She said that she did. So we sat down again and talked out some other issues that we had. So now we were talking our issues out and, when we got into fights we would resolve them. 

Unfortunately

So we went to therapy, and it allowed us to start to solve our issues on our own outside therapy.

We started therapy the first week of August. Now in my story we are in mid-September. So while things were better

So we broke up. It sucked a lot

After a few weeks M contacts me

Here is the fucked up part:

Then in the second week of October M tells me she is going to visit a ""friend"" in Australia. Guess what. It's the guy she cheated on me with. (Indian guy

She comes back to the States mid November

She left on Monday to go to India to get married to this guy.

I saw her for the first time since we broke up, and pick up a bunch of my stuff she had. I told her that I wasn't ok with what she did to me, and that I'm not ok with what she is doing, and this will probably be the last time that we see each other. 

And that brings us to today. It's a crazy story. Sorry this wasn't the post you were expecting.

Also I have had sex with someone since then

My fiancé [23M] and I [23F] have been together for four years, we’re perfect for each other.  I’m extremely extroverted, and he’s a pretty quiet guy.  He balances my crazy outgoing side out, and I help him be a little more social.  He really is the sweetest guy, and the thought of losing him is truly unbearable.

Anyway

I'm a 5'3"" Asian American girl who weighs 140 pounds.  I definitely don't have a typical Asian body.  I've got big bones, but I'm not big.  However, I've always grown up being extremely aware of my size.  My mother grew up in Asia where EVERYBODY is tiny.  My entire life, I've had to deal with her saying very blunt things to me like, ""You're so much bigger than me"" and ""Wow, I can't believe you weigh 140 pounds because I'm only 105.""  Whenever I visit relatives, they've always pointed out that I'm the biggest girl in the entire family, and I have awfully low self-esteem because of all this.  Before I move on

During the summer of 2011, step aerobics, and biking.  And I LOVED it.  It became something I looked forward to doing everyday.  After three months, I had lost 15 pounds and toned up quite a bit.  I felt amazing about myself, and for the first time ever, my self-esteem was so high that it felt like I was floating on clouds.  My life seemed to improve drastically, as well.  I slept better, and studied better.  It felt great being so healthy!

But my boyfriend (who was working in a different city), other than, ""I can't explain it, but I just don't like you doing it.""  At first, I thought he was just being a little dramatic, but over time, I realized he was serious.  That whole summer was miserable for us.  We had never really been long-distance, right?  But when I explained to him that I was so happy with my new body

Once fall semester started again and he moved back to the same city, I'd bring up that I'd like to work out, and the whole big fight would happen again.  I even tried compromising by saying I would only work out a few times a week instead of everyday, but he'd say that even working out one day was over his maximum allowance.  I started getting so frustrated that I began arguing that it was my body and that I should be allowed to do what I want with it.  He would just respond, “If you loved me, then you’d stop.  But if not, then fine.  We’re done.”  But I just couldn’t let our relationship end.  Not because of something like this.

When 2012 started, I eventually gained all of the weight back.  Down my self-esteem went.  Once I was healthy again, I wanted to get back in shape so badly.  Not just because I wanted to get that awesome body back, but because it felt so good to be healthy!  But I didn’t mention it for fear of losing my boyfriend.

Now it’s May of 2013.  And we’ve had a great year.  I was ecstatic when he proposed, it almost feels like we’re already married.  Our lives are so intertwined that I can’t picture being without him.  My clinicals are done in a month, and I hope to have a job in the same city that he’s in.  We’ve been talking about moving in together, and we’ve already started planning the wedding.  Everything about my life has been so perfect lately.  But I still can’t help but want to get back into shape.

Last night when we were video-chatting, and he immediately went cold and turned into the stranger I don’t know.  He said, “I’m sorry for making you so completely miserable.  You should start looking into getting your own apartment.”  And he hung up on me.  I haven’t been able to get in touch with him since.

/r/relationships

 Also

* He’s not in great shape, deep vein thrombosis, and heart problems.  Being in the medical field, I’ve expressed my concern about this to him.  Recently, he began exercising everyday and has a goal to lose 40 pounds.  He says he’s not doing it for him, but he’s doing it for me.
* He’s my second relationship, sex, everything.  He’s never dated anyone before.
* He also has low self-esteem.  I’m the first girl who ever showed interest in him
* I haven’t always been a perfect girlfriend.  We got off to a bad start because I couldn’t let go of my first boyfriend.  Then I made a huge mistake and cheated on him.  I know I know
* Because I’ve been so crappy in the past

**TL;DR: I’m an average-sized Asian girl whose mother and relatives made extremely conscious about her body growing up.  Started working out in 2011, but he doesn't want me working out at all.  I just don’t understand it, and it’s threatened to end our relationship multiple times.  Please, help me.**

**Edit:** I knew you guys would have good insight.  I've read every single comment

 What really kills me is that I'd brought up pretty much this exact thing as a source of insecurity for me, but I'm not sure I can. I still love her to death but I can't have this thought be in my mind and continue my relationship.

1336680369.0,tgzsn,"My mother is having an affair. She is planning on leaving my father in a year. I know this, but he doesn't, and it's eating away at my every day. How do I handle this knowledge?",wishbee,234,140, female, but I have endless memories of them screaming at each other and fighting constantly. In fact

For the longest time, but she was always a lot happier away from him. We'd often hang out with her best friend, Jim. I sometimes suspected her of cheating on my father with Jim. My mother would always make me lie to my father about what we did and who she was with. Since I grew up this way, it became ""normal"" for me, and I didn't really start to question it until I was close to leaving for college. Once I moved away, it became clear to me how fucked up all of it was. I went through therapy, and that helped a lot

My father never made me do anything like that. I think that he's always loved my mother, Mother's Day, etc. He puts a lot of thought into it. For example, since my mom loves horses, he's getting her a nice painting of a horse for Mother's Day. He works two jobs to provide for us. My mom quit her job when I was little so that she could stay at home with me. Now, she has a side job, but it's still my dad's money that pays for the house and all of the nice things we've gotten to do

Needless to say, we just don't talk much. I could never imagine moving back home. Every time I'm home, even if it's only for a weekend, I feel terribly sad. My sister and I are really close, and we get along great, but that's all I've got when I'm there. 

As I was growing up, because it's basically your funeral!"" As a growing young girl, this really affected me. I was close to my mom until I turned 14 or 15, and that's when things got rough between us and we started fighting a lot. As I mentioned, now, we don't talk much. It's the easiest way to avoid fighting with her.

About a year ago, whom she reconnected with via facebook (of course). I tried to be supportive and tell her that she could talk to me about it, because, well, she's my mom, and she was crying. I didn't know what to do. I asked her why she hadn't just left dad, and why she ever even married him in the first place.

She never left my dad because she couldn't support herself financially. She didn't go to college. She only married my dad because my grandfather threatened to disown her if she didn't. While she didn't say this next part directly

She told me that she plans on leaving my father after my sister graduates high school. At the time

Living with this knowledge -- the affair, although she does mention his name occasionally.

I once logged onto her email account and read some emails

For a while

I'm not worried about my mom. She's obviously happy with this new guy. I'm not worried about my sister. She's strong and smart and she can handle it. The person I'm worried about is my father.

He doesn't have any friends. He might have a few co-workers that he gets along with, never does anything like that. He works and comes home, sleeps, and works again. He doesn't even really have a hobby. He plays the bass guitar sometimes, and when he was much younger, he was in a band, but that's it. He's sort of introverted and doesn't seem very friendly when you first meet him

What is he going to do when my mom leaves him and he's completely alone? He's not even close with his side of the family. He really only keeps in contact with his mother, or maybe she's just getting old. Last Christmas, she was staying at our house, and she woke up one morning and didn't know who my dad was. She recovered and was totally normal later. That's one of the few times I've seen my dad cry.

I can't even talk to him without thinking about all of this stuff. I've started avoiding his phone calls, I hate my mom for all of this. I wish she'd never told me, because knowing what's coming is like watching a clock ticking down to a bomb going off, and there's absolutely nothing I can do to stop it.

It makes me feel so sad. I know I'll be able to handle their divorce

I don't feel like I can tell him. I don't even think that would be the right thing to do. My sister still lives at home, I'm terrified of my dad finding out, because of the reasons listed above.

Please, but I'm trying to get over that. There's no defense for her actions. But she was in a shitty situation and she's been unhappy for over twenty years. We are all human and flawed.

First off

I'm just going to start typing and I'm sorry if it gets too long winded but I'll tell it as it went down.

**Wednesday Night**
After posting my original story here, dated, everything. Neither of us has moved out of the house yet so basically I am sleeping downstairs on the couch. I was a bit shell shocked when she actually signed the papers, but ok, whatever. She said was going to file them first thing in the morning so I said fine.  

While I was resting on the couch, and did not keep my word and such. I tried not to say too much for fear of setting her off, but then she started comparing my love of her to my love for my family. I told her I that I loved her and my family equally, as you are both my family, but love for wife is different than love for parents. Just a different type of love, IMO. She didn't accept that answer, texted me another couple paragraphs and she stormed out of the house and did not return till after midnight. 

**Thursday Afternoon/Night**
In the morning, I would. She responded ,""unlike you, I actually do what I say.""  OK, Enough said. I came home from work and saw her 
car in the garage earlier than usual.  I was scared to go upstairs into my home office because of what I knew would be waiting there for me on my desk. I couldn't face it

My wife started to text me again from upstairs. It started out with ""Just know that I still love you.""  I responded, her response was , ""If you loved me, you wouldn't have made me apologize to your family against my will."" So, Basically circles...each party thinks they have the right and valid argument. 

Not wanting to piss her off even more, ok, No more replies. I'll STFU.  Then she started to text me, ""let's just be happy for our last days together.""  In addition to that, she was texting me about how it's fine, she's ok with it, its better for the both of us

A few moments later, it would only make things harder for me because at the end of the day, it is not going to mean anything.  She told me should would be out by the end of the week (house is owned by my family trust so there will be no division of property here and I cannot be the one to move out). I told her, just take your time to get your situation straightened out. I will buy another bed and sleep on it temporarily. 

She goes back upstairs and So I go back on my couch. She texts me again. Telling me how I did not deliver on my part but she did. (after the apology it took her about 12 months to regain trust back in my family again, or simple social stuff). So she used this against me to say that she did her part and I didn't. So the ""divorce"" was basically a result of my actions. And her anger was a result of my lack of communication skills over and over.

She did finally admit some fault tho. She said it was her fault for NOT walking out at the time I said he had to apologize to my family. She said she should have left me back then but because she loved me so much, and has been making me pay for it ever since.)  She said it was typical of me to think negative like that of her.

She then came back downstairs sat with me on the couch.  I started to tell her again that I don't believe she loved me

Btw, and getting worked up. I asked if I could say something. I told her I couldn't live in fear anymore and worry about her moods on a daily basis.  I told her It WAS MY FAULT for not bridging the gap correct between my family and spouse.  I told her I assumed she saw my folks the way I did through my eyes BUT made the wrong assumption and did not work the communication correctly between the two parties.  I did say, Even though I made a mistake, I am human and I wish to take the steps to correct it and do better.  I said I wanted to learn HOW TO bridge the gap properly but you never gave me a chance to do it.  It was like this for me, every time I wanted to speak to her about my family or teach her something, She was in a good mood, I was scared that by me bringing up my family, so I would only bring up issues DURING our fights

She told me, had she known that this was what i was trying to do (leaning how to bridge gap), then she would have taken a different approach with me this whole time.  BUT I told her this all too late, I was late in telling her, and because of that, its too late.  So she said it was my fault, this divorce for miscommunication. I told her I want to learn but I need time and patience from you

Again, she would step up and do something positive to keep us together.

She finally admitted it and said ""we both made mistakes."" BUT

It hurts really bad right now because I do really love her and I have given her everything. It would have been easier if she screamed at me and stormed out. Now that she is being very nice and sweet

**TL;DR**  Wife actually filed for divorce. We are still living under the same roof maybe for the next week or two and she is being very nice and sweet to me. Is she trying to make me feel guilty? or regret? After divorce,False,,t5_2qjvn,False,,,t3_pjht3

So i called her up and told her that i was through with her and i wasn't going to let her use me anymore. It was a hard phone call and the next couple of days questioning everything was also pretty rough but i'm ok with it all now. About a day after the phone call i sent her a big long heartfelt message in which i just wrote down all of my feelings about how she could go from telling me she loved me one day to fucking another guy the next. Venting really helped to relax me and give me some sort of closure.

I found out the day after this (from the same friend as original post) that she had been sharing this message around her friends (guys and girls) laughing about how much of a ""faggot"" i was. This made me so angry! I have never been a violent person in any way at all

I'm now glad that i am no longer in a relationship with her because this new side of her i have now seen is not a nice one.

1) I don't want a child. I've communicated this to her over the course of the relationship but conceded that I'd possibly be open to the idea in a decade (i.e.

2) This is what really sparked the change: Her girlfriends, and my girlfriend has indicated that, if by some freak accident, she managed to get pregnant, at her age she'd certainly keep the baby.

3) I don't trust her, while I have changed radically--undergoing intensive therapy--she has not.

My girlfriend has a history of dishonesty and shady behavior, sleeping together without a condom--she will at some point slip up and get pregnant ""by accident."" Then, once she's good and pregnant and I'm pissed off, everyone will be like, ""Well, what did you think would happen? Should've wrapped it up, bruh!""

So

Me: ""I'm sorry, I'd gladly do whatever it takes to satisfy you."" 

Her: ""But the pill is full-proof. It works. I've been taking it for over 15 years without a scare.""

Me: ""Well

Her: ""I'm not going to get pregnant.""

Me: ""I don't want to risk it.""

So on and so forth.

She says that, she'd at the very least not take it as regularly, thus obviously fucking with its efficacy. I tell her that a condom used by itself is even less effective than the pill. She doesn't care--says that maybe getting off the pill would make sex with a condom more enjoyable, to which I respond ""See, now you're missing the point--that is, to not have a kid.""

So, wouldn't she try to work out the relationship, even if it means we use condoms henceforth? Could my decision to use condoms henceforth really be deemed a relationship-terminating ""offense"" to a sane person?


TL;DR
After five years of condom-less sex with my girlfriend



Edit: I'm somewhat surprised that I have been largely demonized within this post. It's amazing how many redditors turned the matter onto its head, and otherwise attempting to shame me for supposedly robbing some poor thirty-something girl of her fertile years, when nothing of the sort is happening and she stays of her own volition. (Apparently, and this isn't something to which I typically pay attention, I've been downvoted through the floor, too.) My communication about my desire to not have children anytime soon has been only too clear. Every discussion of separation due to the child issue has been met by her with anger and the reassurance that she doesn't even know that she wants children; it's just that she doesn't like the idea of me closing the books on the possibility altogether.

For all that

**TL;DR: Caught fiancee cheating on me with a married man for the last 3 years.
she left and took the dog and her essentials.
Shes acts angry at me and i got dumped because i caught her.
I gave the husband an option to come clean with his wife first, shouldnt of told him.
For some reason i really want her back

   I ended up finding the wife's name with help from a friendly redditor.
 calling the husband first to give him a chance and come clean to her first.(not sure why i did this.)

  I told him shes going to know either way but she could hear it from her first before i told her. 
 I told him id call him the next day around the same time.
 
When i did he said he doesn't need to tell her anything and if i talk to her he would kill me. ( i have no intentions of taking that as a real threat)
I face booked his wife after but didnt get a response.
I figured he deleted it so i face booked her again while i knew he would be at work a few days later but still no reply


As far as me and my ex go. Its fucked up and really weird.
Forsome reason i cant stop thinking about her
Everything was so perfect before i found this out

I contacted her a few days after because i really just wanted to see my dog

So she was going to let me take her for the weekend but when she was on her way over she said shes just coming alone. It was weird

Shes taking this alot better than i am. I know it will never work again but it kills me that im the one chasing her. If she was chasing me or even wanted me back i think id feel better. im so embarrsed about this whole situation

I barley have left my house since
I know im not handling this the right way and i shouldnt want her back but i cant help it. It feels like that now she is honest i can finally trust her

I dont want my life to change and i dont want to lose what i had.
Id rather be stepped on then left all alone

 Being with her made me a extreme introvert over the last few years

Its weird not seeing her car here when i pull up and its weird going to sleep alone and waking up alone. I haven't done this for over 7 years.

the electricity is in her name and is getting shut off the 18th.
Im not sure what im going to do.i cant afford to live here but i can not live on someones couch again.( i couch surfed from when i was 15-18)
i posted an ad for a roommate

Sorry for the formatting ill try and fix everything later.
I guess its time to go to /r/breakups. I use to read that sub alot feeling bad for everyone

Also if anyone lives on a farm and wants someone to work there for room and board let me know! I would love to get out of this state for a while.

May 7

**TL;DR of previous original post and subsequent updates**: Our relationship (9 years) and marriage (almost 4 years) crumbled overnight as soon as he returned from a combat zone deployment. An initial PTSD meltdown began a journey of discovery into what my life *really* was; the lies, the alcohol abuse, etc. My last post was five months ago, so I figured it was about time for an update. This is going to end up longer than I intend it to, so I offer preemptive apologies.

I'll also update about our daughter [7]. 

OK


Over the course of the last eight months, has just about completely cut off contact with my daughter and I. I couldn't care less that this man doesn't want to talk to me. Most conversations we've had in the last year have ended up with him yelling at me for one reason or another, more often than not, how I'm some kind of gold digger for not dropping a request for a ***small*** amount of allimony. Remember, this man left my daughter and me in another state, refused to let us move back home, and told me to

Jr. recently got orders to go overseas again, once the decree is filed, it wouldn't be able to be amended until he returns 2 years from now. Oh, and as soon as he gets there, his paycheck will double, so he can keep the child support as low as possible).

I'm not money hungry. I'm **definitely** not looking for a reason to prolong this divorce. I agreed to sign as long as the terms we've been living with over the last 8 months stay the same. I'm pretty sure he's trying to marry the neighbor he initially left me for

Jr.'s contact with our daughter has been inconsistent at best, the crack whore wouldn't come in the house, he talked with my beautiful daughter for ten minutes, handed her a twenty dollar bill, and left.

I never heard a thing from him.

In fact

Jr. has cut contact with just about all his family, but its only been relatively recently that I can finally say I've moved on from it all.

I'm pretty confident his gf,"" has had A LOT to do with him isolating and alienating himself from everyone he knows. Or knew. I have no respect for the slag, and she adds to my contempt for him if I think about it for more than five minutes. 

How can I say this

Let me rewind. In October, he hadn't seen her since February. I thought it was more important for her to have one-on-one time with him. He didn't. So, I did what any sensible mother would do; I firmly shook the hand of the woman that helped destroy my family. With a smile and I'm-currently-skull-fucking-you-in-my-mind-with-my-power-eye contact. She was EXTREMELY passive, i.e., a coward. I told her how wonderful my daughter was and how much she missed her father. I told her that despite how awkward this situation was, everyone involve *would* be adult about it around my daughter. I told Tuna and Jr. to enjoy themselves and nearly skipped out the door. I almost threw up afterward, but sometimes faking strength makes you stronger. I felt good about it.

Unfortunately for my daughter, she was hospitalized for a week. It was serious. She had a plethora of illnesses, including strep throat, pneumonia, ear infections, impetigo, etc. Her immune system is really struggling to protect her. One doc said her body is acting like she's severely allergic to something, her referral was denied. 

He never called while she was in the hospital. He never called after she got out. The first time he called since she was released (Dec 19


My daughter is really starting to exhibit anger towards her father. I don't **ever** begin or encourage daddy bashing sessions. I listen, innocent angel.

As for me? Things are pretty wonderful. That man I started seeing as a rebound? Yeah, finally. It isn't all rainbow cum and hi-dad soup, but its better than any other romantic relationship I've ever had, and the feelings I get in my gut when the three of us (him, me and my daughter) spend time together... its a kind of paradise without ever having to leave home.

All in all

***TL;DR:*** He's still with the haggard street-sweeping vaginal hood. I'm still a little bitter, shuns his family for talking to me, and seems like he is getting worse. I love my daughter, I love myself, I love this man I've found in a sea of boys. Slow and steady, I think I **can**.

About a week ago we were in bed and she told me she wanted to try and mix things up and that she wanted her butt licked.  I was kind of turned off by the idea but did it anyway.

Well last night I see a few of her friends and they start laughing at me about how my girlfriend can even get me to lick and kiss her b-hole and how whipped I am.

I am completely mortified about this blatant lack privacy.  To tell all her friends about what we do in the bedroom really weirds me out.  When I tried to talk to her about she just laughs it off and says ""well it's true isn't it.""

What really gets me upset is that apparently she has been ""bragging"" to her friends about how I constantly perform oral and other things now for her and that she doesn't have to reciprocate because she thinks it's gross.  So a serious issue I am having

1349275353.0,10vk8i,I (24 F) found a post too similar to my situation with my SO (25 M). Turns out its his. I feel like it’s my turn to ask for help,noladyboner,220,31,296,"**EDIT** - After having our discussion about the posts and the advice given

**EDIT 2** - I do want to mention that my ages and relationship length are correct. His are different due to him trying to keep me from recognizing it. 

Browsing around the subreddit on another sleepless night I came across a post that mirrored my own relationship. Save some differences, while a couple of things bother me about his post (I plan to link it later after reading the advice here and talking with him about it) what hurt the most was reading his take on the relationship and just how much it differs from my own. It’s funny how two people can be in the same relationship and experience the same things and have such a different take on events.

My SO and I have been together for about 3 ½ years and living together pretty much the entire time. I was recently divorced and had a nice home. He was in between renting and buying his own place so staying with me made sense. Even after his home was purchased he still stayed with me. We had a wonderful and passionate relationship for the first year or so. While his post touched on different things such as finances and household chores

First, this kills the sex drive. Very quickly. This was coupled with a few health issues such as kidney stones and a heart issue that required surgery. Needless to say I was just not up for sex. While my SO understood in the beginning, I know that it quickly grew to be a huge problem for him. After many fights he suggested seeing a sex therapist. I loved the idea. I missed my sex drive and was eager to regain it. I had stopped taking the Depo shot (who needs it if you’re not having sex right?) a few months earlier and at the advice the therapist I changed to the non hormonal IUD option. He also suggested that I have my hormones checked. Those results showed a huge imbalance of progesterone. It was no wonder I can't get a lady boner. He referred me to a compound pharmacist who now has me on a cocktail of hormones and supplements to jump start my libido. 

Sounds like progress right? Not to my SO. He’s been very impatient with this. I don’t fully blame him. It’s been a long time. But to me it seemed like he expected me to take my first dose of the hormone and I would be right as rain. I’m only about 2 weeks in and he seems so upset that things haven’t changed. I’m frustrated because I know he’s upset. I’m upset because it doesn’t seem like he’s acknowledged the fact that I’m TRYING. I’m doing everything I can to make this better. I’ve read the self help books, I’ve been taking the hormones. I just can’t seem to get it across to him that as a woman, libido isn’t a light switch. I can’t just get in the mood often. He’s taken this as a hit to his ego and that I must not love him as much. I am beating my brains out to try to convince him that I love him more than ever and I’m just as frustrated. I know it’s hurting the relationship. I know its pushing him away. I’m so damn scared that my inability to keep him sexually happy is going to push him into someone else’s bed.  

So here is where I ask for advice. What else can I do to convince this man that I’m head over heels in love with him? I find him so attractive in many different ways. But despite me telling him this

TL;DR - no lady boners for me despite trying. SO just doesn’t seem to understand.

My sister is going though the typical 6th grade 'scene kid' phase. She is a little chubby and is trying to fit in with anyone she can. She is overly hormonal for her age

Some things that have raised concern: her getting caught smoking our parents cigarette butts, how she treats and talks to her friends/family. 

I realize most of this is normal teenage behavior but in this case it is to the extreme. It's gotten to the point where having a normal conversation is almost impossible. She is always giving a terrible attitude and being extremely rude to everyone she comes in contact with. My mom and I have tried to talk to her on several occasions but no one can get threw to her. 

Out of curiosity, her 'best friend' who she calls Mommy has always given me a weird vibe and I can tell she is a bad influence on my sister. I looked at those messages and I think I am scared for life. Here are A FEW of the disturbing things they said to each other, mind you their both 12 and in 6th grade. 

-talking about having a 3 sum in my basement 
-having kissy time
-'I'm wet wet pussy ready'
-are you bi? We should hook up?
-asking if she's on her period
-talking about their other friend (who is also in 6th grade) who is supposedly pregnant but had a miscarriage. Yet talks in detail about her sex life. 
-calling each other 'babe' and 'sexy'
-complimenting each other endlessly on how good they were
-talking about smoking weed together

Honestly, so be it and I will support her 100%. I have nothing against same gender relationships and I don't want anyone to be offended by this post. I simply do not know what to think of it. Is it normal for kids to be acting like this now-a-days? How should I go about approaching her on this topic, if at all? 

Tl;dr. Sister is talking to bad influence friends inappropriately and having 'kissy time' in the basement of our house. Don't know what to think. 

By the way this is my first post. 

Edit: I am a 16 year old female

Thank you guys so much for the advice. You've cleared up my thoughts entirely. I've decided I am going to show my mom the messages and the comments on this post and see what she has to say about it. I am hoping it will open up her mind to counseling or a doctors visit to talk about hormonal imbalance.

We got married 10 months ago

Yesterday he left his emails open and I found many, and are sent back and forth many times a day. 

I looked in his bag, about our home renovation (!) and of course sex and how much they love him. 

I confronted him. He says most of it was ""fantasy"" but he did meet one girl since we have been married. He said her texts about how she loved having sex with him was ""fantasy"". Says she never was in our home... He just met her on the corner to give her rent money and talk because she ""needed help"".

I feel like that is bullshit. Why did she use past tense about the sex (2 times) then? Why is he paying her? 

I simply am in shock because I love my husband. What do I do? I don't think I can forgive. Please

I go to a top 3 engineering program so the distance didn't make my studies any easier. We have been through a lot of things in our time together that have made us very strong in our relationship. I am now finishing up a year I took off from school for co-ops for Intel for 6 months and now 7 months for another big tech company close to where my gf lives. 
Long story short, we decided to get married in another country  this summer; more long distance in the face of uncertainty was not an option any more. 
We talked to 2 different lawyers and 2 different priests who advised us on how to proceed with our decision. Having talked about it extensively, no congratulations, just me and my fiance holding hands and holding back the tears. My dad, after questioning me harshly about the intentions and timing, stormed off the restaurant without saying good-bye (My response was that we did not want more long distance, specially since we are ready and eager to form a family).

Today I received many texts of my father furiously emphasizing that we needed to talk and how I was not to be addressed as an adult because I did not deserve it. He blames me for putting her above his demands

Some background details: 

* We are Catholic so we'd prefer to be married by the church before moving in together. 

* Also

* My mom has always been overprotective and hyper critical of others.

* My SO is a wonderful woman who works with special needs kids

* We are both financially independent with ample savings

* Everyone in her family is very happy and supportive.

I realize the details are sparse but my SO is really suffering because of this and doesn't feel accepted by my family. This

Thanks in advanced.

My girlfriend and I recently moved in together as of July 2012. We have been together on and off for about 3.5 years with a 4 month break that started because she wasn't sure about us anymore and she wanted to find out what she wanted, and saving up to move out.


I won her back after the break


Right after we got back together, who won't stop giving her shit for getting back together with me. He constantly tells her to break up with me and to fuck his best friend. Shes fine talking to him all the time about things like this and how she thinks other guys are hot, even after moving in with me. She hasn't cheated on me as far as I know, but I am getting fed up with it. I snapped and told Ed to stop telling her to fuck his best friend, and to leave our relationship alone, what happens doesn't need any outside help and that she would figure out if shes happy and wants to be with me on her own. He responded with a ""I know whats best for her brah"" type of bullshit assuming he knows everything about her.


I only found out about this because I went to check facebook last night and realized she was logged in


This pisses me off since I have been almost fully paying for the rent while she goes to school


Other things she has been doing recently: Went out with a ""hot"" guy to the bar just because he wouldn't stop bothering her. She doesn't have an answer to this when I told her she should have told him to **** off. She also constantly goes to see her other guy friend with all kinds of issues at the drop of a hat

We had a talk about it last night, but not if she is going to be unhappy...


All because I accidentally saw a facebook message. I know it was wrong to read it


Anyways


tl;dr
My girlfriend moved in together and she hangs out with guy friends all the time and doesn't really seem into our relationship. I love her and want to be with her

EDIT

UPDATE*******

So we had a long talk about everything and I said I was unhappy. She has to move back in with her mom (who is getting evicted in the spring) and has to find somewhere to live and get a better job while being a full time student while I get a pretty shnazzy apartment all to myself! I doubt she'll change her ways anytime soon

Here's the issue: About a year ago I went back to school for an executive degree. I met a lot of friendly people from a wide range of ages (from 19 to 40) since some of our classes are with younger, smart, gorgeous, and we have an amazing chemistry when we talk and work. I can't stop thinking about her and am incredibly happy every time we're together. It would be the dream situation for when you're single, but it's a horrible one when you're already married.

Now, and as such am doing my best to limit my interactions with this girl. I've been telling myself that these strong emotions I constantly feel for her are just infatuation, or that I'm feeling this way in part simply because it's something ""new"" (basically I'm just repeating the advice I have read online for other people in similar circumstances). I've also re-doubled my efforts in my marriage (another common piece of advice), making a point to take time to really talk with my wife every day, spend quality time with her, take trips together and go on ""romantic"" dates. We enjoy our time together and she constantly tells me how happy she is and how much she loves me, and I (honestly) tell her the same. 

Despite the time and efforts, and instead of the infatuation subsiding, it's gotten deeper and more intense, to the point where I'm honestly starting to feel like it is something more serious than infatuation. Next to my wife, this girl is the most wonderful and amazing person I have ever met, and when I'm not around her I keep thinking about her. Limiting my interactions with this girl hasn't helped, nor have my recent efforts to keep our conversations solely on school-related topics. Our group work is almost over, and will therefore be around each other

So I suppose the advice/input I am looking for is: have other married people been in this situation, how did you deal with it, and when/how did those feelings finally go away (or do they)?

We became Facebook official shortly after New Years. The relationship itself has been over a month. I've known her longer than that, and I kissed a girl (her) for the first time on New Years. 

What I don't understand is why she's with me. I'm a loser, and playing League of Legends with other STEM majors. I go to the odd party, but that's not very often. I took up lifting because the school gym is free, but believe me when I say that I'm not fit, just not fat.

She's a sorority girl. Popular, etc. If she posts one thing on Facebook, you can bet she'll get 17+ likes. Has a handful of suitors that would date her if she gave them a shot. Most of these guys are copies of Ryan Gosling/Chris Pine/Ryan Reynolds. In other words, they are better than I am.

It was revealed on V-day night that I was insecure as hell. She dropped the ""I love you"" bomb on me, accusing me of using her for sex. I haven't talked to her since. My best friend told me to let her call first, and I'm taking his advice because, unlike me, he's quite successful with women. And so, I spent yesterday playing LoL in an attempt to ignore this situation.

I've gotten no love for 22 years, when you have a girl that's bombarded with better options, it just makes me extremely paranoid that she'll cheat and I wind up bitter, angry, and sad.

She is an avid tumblr user and I had known about this in the past, spanking herself, etc. On top of all that she has a section where she is selling her worn and used underwear, with additional options for length of her wearing them, whether she masturbates with them on, etc.

She has never mentioned any of this to me. She doesn't work and I had always wondered how she would get the money for new shoes, she either brush it off as her ""having leftover money"" or her parents giving her cash.

Honestly, she's wearing the outfit that I had bought for her as a birthday gift.

I didn't break into her email or anything to find this secret tumblr either

I feel crushed, and angry right now. Long story short, I started to get suspicious of various things that happened in our relationship, and did the rather ungraceful act of installing a keylogger on my computer. I didn't have the evidence I needed to confront her with my suspicions, and felt like accusing her without proof would lead to massive drama.

As of 2 hours ago, manipulative, disgusting person she is. Suffice to say that literally almost every other word out of her mouth is a lie to both me and her husband who is away for work for extended periods of time. She has also done and said some things that would make Jesus himself divorce her. I don't want to get into it because I'd rather this not be personally identifiable by anyone who might read it, but suffice to say she has stooped lower than most people would think is humanly possible...way beyond simply cheating.

The sad thing is that I felt like she was ""the one"" and was amazing in almost every aspect of a relationship you could be amazing at...besides being a decent human being apparently. I gave her my all and was always 100% honest, took her awesome places, and generally just had a blast with her. We never fought.

So my question to reddit is: How should I end this? I guess I'm looking for people to talk me down from the ledge of insane thoughts I'm having about how best to carry out some kind of revenge (no physical harm of course). I mean I could literally burn her world down with what I know

**My options:**
1) Nuclear. I send out a mass facebook message to every one of her friends letting them know she's a lying, including some of the disgusting details I've left out of this.

2) Cruise Missile. Less messy

3) White Flag. Meet her in person

Right now I'm leaning towards 1 or 2

As for me

Thank you for the ongoing advice guys. I've ruled out option 1 and will almost surely be doing option 2 and leaving the rest in her husband's hands. Since I'm not a reddit newb

A few additional points: My state doesn't take into account fault in divorce or alimony

I also want to thank those talking about the psychology of this. She is clearly a very very troubled girl and based on her background it does not really surprise me. I thought she was the exception

Not posting a new thread because the resolution was anti-climactic and I also don't want her to see this since she does occasionally check reddit and I was obviously really angry when I wrote it. Basically I went with option 3 because I wanted to give her a chance to explain herself. After she did, and it was just a matter of finding a job in another town before she could do that and support herself. Unfortunately, she decided she wanted to wait for just the right job, instead of simply doing what it took to move out and start a new life the right way.

Just an update for you guys

Basically after that post, I was a disgrace to men everywhere.

Well after 2-3 months, I've got to stop this. So I told her this was going to end. I tried all I could, and I was going to move on with life. I thought that was the end.

To my surprise (at that time), she still didn't want to relinquish contact with her ex-boyfriend, but everytime I tried to cut off ties with her, she kept crying and begging me not to leave her.

Oh well.

I made my second mistake, meeting her up very often, doing favours for her, etc.

Around this point of time, she would say ""It's ok."" in that tone in which you knew it was NOT okay, followed by one-word answers for the rest of the day. You know the drill, guys.

She would do a lot of other passive-aggressive things.

Now by this point

In early Feb

When I got to the hotel after a long day of work, so I couldn't Whatsapp her.

After surfing reddit, saying: ""So you have time to surf Facebook but no time to message me?""

I totally lost it. I found that she was online on Facebook, you know, ALLCAPS STYLE, and after 10minutes or so of virtual arguing I gave up and logged off, and went to bed.

I got a very long Facebook message from her about 2 hours later. She apologized for what she did

I replied her with a message, but neither was it warm. I would say it was ""business-like"".

I basically told her that I could remain friends with her

She replied with multiple messages, I'm no longer giving her time, no longer putting in effort into the relationship, etc, etc, etc.

I didn't reply to that.

I didn't contact her ever since.

Ever since that night, started watching my diet. I've spent more time practicing the guitar, re-establishing old friends, going out for drinks and to listen to good live music.

About a month after I started ignoring her

There was a little bit of perverse joy in how happy and relieved I was to finally rid myself of all the last remaining signs of her presence in my life.

I had a revelation last month, whom I missed so much. (Quick background, I used to walk her dog and play with her dog more than any member of her family, except her father.)

When her dog saw me from far away, I was so glad to see him after nearly 2 months of not playing with him.

I told my friend after that night: You know how I know I'm over &lt;Ex-gf's name&gt;? It sounds mean

Thank you to everyone on Reddit for your great advice; you were all tremendously helpful. Most of you told me to continue sticking it out and continue supporting my boyfriend emotionally and financially

Turns out all of you were right - since November his business has begun to pick up so quickly we barely know what to do with ourselves. On top of that

The shift has been so wonderful for our relationship and his self esteem. We have a really refreshed and exciting view on the future and what we can do and accomplish together. He is currently going above and beyond to contribute - I'm still covering rent and bills (which will change in Feb) but he is paying for everything in between and refusing to let me pay for anything when we go out

He even says he'd be more than happy to support both of us indefinitely and so I wouldn't even have to work if I didn't want to but... that's not going to happen. :-P

The best part is that I have had a big hand in the current success of the business and have been by his side since day one - he acknowledges this daily and is tremendously grateful. The fact that the business is ""our baby"" has added something really special to our relationship and makes us so grateful for each other and proud of what we have accomplished.

It's a really exciting time for both of us - thanks again to all of you for all your great advice!

1335645981.0,sx8df,My boyfriend is beginning to scare me,kaizersorchestra,227,47,161,"First of all

So, but I moved to England to go to uni, only 30 minutes away from him. He has always been absolutely lovely and great, but lately things have started to get worse. I guess it all started at the beginning of our relationship, when I went to a party without him, and some guy randomly kissed me. I want to make it clear that I didn't kiss him back and only pushed him away and told him I have a boyfriend. I told my boyfriend about it and he said it wasn't my fault and it was okay, but it seems like he's changed his mind about it.

The problems started around 5 months ago. He would get suspicious of everything I did, only that he was being paranoid because he loves me and doesn't want to lose me, but I'm not so sure anymore.

Ever since it first started it's only gotten worse. He started getting mad for everything I did. He can get mad at me for not texting him back within a certain amount of time, and if I ever say no to him he'll go on about how I would 'fool around with lots of guys at parties but not even have sex with my own boyfriend' until I just go with it. We've both always liked pretty rough sex, but lately even that is getting a bit out of hand, especially if I don't say yes when he first wants it. He also makes me buy him pretty much everything, because I come from a very well off family and he doesn't have a job. For example he now wants me to get him a new computer for £400, so he can play games on it with his friends.

Now, he doesn't want me to have any people over, and he also made me quit my dance classes because he thought there were too many guys there (there are two, one of them is the instructor). He also keeps going out all the time with his friends, which leaves me at home with nothing to do and pretty much no one to talk to, and he says I have to deal with it if I love him and want to be with him, because of 'what i've done'.

Every time I go see him now I'm scared that he is either going to break up with me over something he thinks I've done, probably a lot harder than he did. I personally don't see that as bad, because I believe that if I hit someone they have the right to hit me back. A few times he's held me up against a wall or something and told me to shut up before I piss him off more, but it's never been anything serious. He also told me that when I go back to Norway after I finish uni he wants me to delete all my friends from here from facebook and not talk to them. 

The thing is, but all I really want is to fix things, because it's making me feel extremely depressed and unappreciated. The last thing I want is to leave him, and I'm willing to try anything to fix things between us.

Anyway last night, instead of taking the bait and fighting with her about money.

I told her that I wasn't interested in talking about anything money-related, but that really deep crying when someone is in serious emotional pain. It was terrible.

She started naming all the nice things that I've bought for her, she's never going to be able to give me the things she thinks I deserve, and we're never going to be equals, and she is never going to have any power in the relationship, because I own everything. I've never seen her as upset and hurt as she was these past two nights. It seems like this has been on her mind for a while.

When she calmed down, because I want to be in a position to help people. She's not the only person I help financially; I also give a lot to my parents and I have bailed out my brother before, too. I also pointed out that I have a strong track-record, both with her and with others - I don't play power games, I don't expect stuff in return for the gifts I give, and I make sure I'm fair to people. I'm pretty sure her fear of me holding material things over her head comes from the way her sister treats her, but that's another story entirely.

She then asked, ""Do you want to move in?"".

So anyway, and we decided a couple of things last night:

- She will be paying rent

- That money will go into a bank account that I own, since I own the account for her rent and I pay for the other half from my own account.

- Money for little stuff she wants to do (picture frames or whatever) will come out of her normal checking

- She's going to do some research to bring her up to speed on houses in general, re-do a bathroom, something like that. That way hopefully we can be partners and not roommates.

Then she asked if we can get a puppy soon. I'm going to be working 8-hour days for a while instead of my usual 12-hour days, but I want a bigger dog that doesn't run around yapping and shivering and being ugly all the time. I showed her a picture of a corgi, she loved it, I can deal with it, problem solved =)

9 months ago I met a girl who told me (and everyone she knew) that she was 25. I wasn't at all put off by that but she was for a bit concerned about it because she didn't like the concept of dating a younger guy but I told her it was a bit of a double standard really because she didn't find a 20f dating a 25m unusual at all.

So we started dating after a couple of months and then into a really solid and enjoyable relationship. There was some unusual parts of it like she wanted to keep us secret for a few weeks (still hasn't let me meet her sister who she lives with although everyone else knows) and she doesn't want anyone to know we've had sex. 

Other than that it's been a very **very** happy relationship but recently I managed to get a hold of her driving licence and I saw her birthday as being in **1976**! I kept quiet about it until last Sunday where I called her and confronted her about it and she admitted to all of it.

I asked her why she lied and she kept insisting that she didn't 'technically' lie and the reason she *lied* is that when she came to this country her uncle introduced her as being 25 and nobody would believe her when she said she was 37 so she just rolled with it and it just got out of hand.

Part of me thinks ""Well age is just a number"" and nothing about her as actually changed and it was a really really happy relationship
... but another part of me is pretty pissed off that she would lie to me about something so major for so long and that I had to find out the way I did. I also wonder how the hell this will work with 17 years age difference?! 

While I'm pretty sure this wont work out but I don't know how I'd go about ending it and remain friends later on (give each other space for a while obviously) because we pretty much share the same friend circle. This is seriously the weirdest reason I've had to end a relationship.

Has anyone got any advice for me or any stories? Anything to help me process this is appreciated because its a lot to process right now...

Thanks for your time

If youre wondering how the hell I didn't see she was 37. She's extremely young looking and [this pic](http://i.imgur.com/BkBwv.jpg) should explain a lot too.

Girlfriend here. Found my boyfriend's thread about us. He left a lot out

He got me into reddit, too, hah.

TL;DR: I'm worried my boyfriend will leave me over my debt.

It's becoming less about engagement for me

Things he left out: 

He told me when we had been dating for 1 year that he'd be ready to get engaged in 2 more years.  Then slowly

Anyway, where I was ready for that next level of commitment.  I understood that we wouldn't get married for many years.  I figured it would be a long engagement.  I just love telling people that we're in love, that I have an awesome boyfriend who loves me, and that we're soul mates.   It's all very romantic to me to be able to say ""hey, look, I found my soul mate and he makes me so happy.""  It has absolutely NOTHING to do with wanting a ring.  I was staying under $1000 in rings that I looked at.  The ring I told him I wanted was $650.  I couldn't care less about the ring.  It's the commitment and what it symbolizes.

After all this talk

About 2 weeks ago

Fast forward to now... I found his post.  Well
However, so I'm so scared that this will be something we don't see eye to eye on.
To me, funny, supports me emotionally... he does EVERYTHING he can to be a wonderful boyfriend.  I feel so incredibly lucky to have him and feel that he's the best thing that's ever happened to me.

I want more than anything to work this out.

This post is exactly how I feel:
""Nooo... but then again, then I kinda see her issue.
I think you have a lot of good reasons for waiting to get engaged (including unstable situation, etc), but by making it only about the money, you are sending the message that she's not good enough until she meets your financial standards. Whether or not she wants to believe you, your actions don't meet your words, and its hard to ignore that.""

The last paragraph is EXACTLY how I feel.  It seems like to him

I now feel like I'm holding him back or I don't deserve him because he's making good money, he wants to be rich, live without debt, etc.  I feel guilty that I'm not in the situation where I can contribute to our relationship in that way.  I feel bad thinking that maybe I don't deserve him because he deserves a woman who can contribute money equally to the relationship.  It's soooo out of proportion right now.

 It's not my fault I can't contribute yet.  I wish I could.  If I had things my way, and I see that now) and be able to start our lives together.  However, I'm seeing more and more what engagement means to him and that we just disagree on that.  The fact that we're young, we haven't lived together, and we aren't in a stable situation makes complete and total sense.  We CAN'T get married right now.  There's no financial way.  I understand that. 

He's just making it seem like he will leave me if I don't get into nursing school.  I'm so frightened that he'll leave me
I'm also scared to death that he'll hold this debt over my head until I get it paid off.  Now I wonder how he'd handle if something unexpected happened in the future, and I would have more debt?  What if unexpected money issues come up? 

He said a year ago he wanted a pre-nup.  I thought it was unromantic at first

How can we figure out, I would want to stand by him and support him no matter what.

I regret the debt I'm in.  It has been very depressing for me.  If I could do it over, and how it'd affect having a family of my own.  I figured I'd graduate and get a good job, and that everyone lives with some sort of debt.  I see it differently now.

I didn't plan for my aunt to stop cosigning my loans for me, too.  It's pretty much the best art school.  I'm incredibly passionate and hard working.  I was trying to do everything I could to ensure that I'd have a good job after I graduated.

There's nothing I can do about that now

My boyfriend went so far as to say that he thought ""what if"" I dropped out of school all together, but then he goes and thinks I'll do something completely irresponsible.  It's like he suddenly doesn't remember the driven, passionate, hard working person that I am. 

I'm hurt and insulted.  It's MY debt, that I've taken back everything I said, and told him that maybe we should even wait to move in together until after I have a stable nursing job.

I don't want to put my life on hold with him.  I want to be with him so badly.  So, through thick and thin, so I want to stand by him.

I want to do everything I can to pay off my debt in a reasonable way.

I want to spend the rest of my life with him.

I regret that I have to postpone our life together because my aunt stopped cosigning for me and I had no way to return to school until now.

I'm 25. My current girlfriend of two months [22] did not end things well with her ex-boyfriend [30] -we'll call him Jason. When we got together

At first, but when they talked on the phone, he basically insulted her for an hour. When I found out, I forbade him from contacting her, and he obliged for a little while. 

After about two weeks, even between sentences, he alternates between 

1. praising her and unleashing torrents of insults
1. pining for her
1. saying that he's done with her and moved on
4. At first

To be honest, he might deliver on those threats, or I don't know what. They were only together for 3 months, the majority of which was long distance, and I'm bothered by how manic he's acting about this. She's great and all, but wow.

I am in my early thirties and my girlfriend of two years is in her mid twenties. Things have been great

It wasn't until we let her parents stay in our very tiny studio apartment for a few months. During this period, while she would use a dildo, which was significantly larger than my penis (about 6 inches/15 cm).

After her parents left, we began talking and she said that my dick, ""just wasn't enough anymore."" 

I began using my fingers and my tongue to get her off

I've tried experimenting with different positions

We tried adding toys into the mix

She is incredibly frustrated with this whole situation and it really makes me feel less of a man. Sex is becoming more akin to work than anything else. All I think about during intercourse is trying to please her

I'm not sure if this helps or not, in hopes that she would just get used to my penis again, but I catch her masturbating more and more in the bathroom ... to porn videos of men masturbating.

I am in serious need of help. I really don't think this relationship will last if things don't change. We're happy being together

I need advice.,813446,252,72,80,"I've been with my bf for 6 years now and we have a 4-year old kid. We met online and things got serious very fast. In the beginning everything was fine and we were in love. I moved in with him and suddenly I found myself in a huge mess. Suddenly he was nothing like the guy I fell in love with. 

This is going to be very long

**Insults**

Since this is a throwaway I'll be honest and tell you  that I've had a rough childhood with violence and incest. I have been fixing my personal issues the most of my life with the help from professionals.  It has been very hard

 Me and my bf have been together since I was  17
I got pregnant and as most women do, and I felt that it was my fault and irrational. Frankly, I don't want to get pregnant again, because I associate pregnancy with me being unattractive, fat and unwanted. 

Before I started to study (I wasn't able to do that because of my personal issues)

So I worked harder with the therapist, she didn't understand what he was saying, but she saw how much it hurt. I ran to the bathroom and sat there for few hours.  

These are just some of the insults. It is like he is trying to find the most hurtful thing to say. I feel like every time I feel good about something, he can't understand why. He believes that a ""sorry"" would fix it. But it won't.  

He says that everyone says hurtful things when they are angry. It's natural and nothing to be sad about. I'm just being weird. For him I'm being irrational when I tell him that they still hurt. I asked him if he really thought those things about me

I don't like to fight or argue like that. If there is a problem I want to talk about it like adults and solve it. I don't start fights


**Sex**

There is a distance between us that has been growing with every insult. And now I feel like he is a stranger to me. He's not the guy I fell in love with. And when he touches me

He doesn't do this with sex, ignore it and go to sleep. Sometimes he will continue with making me feel bad, and at that point I just want to disappear from this world, because it is like he won't take no for an answer. 

When we do have sex, I don't want him to be a part of my sex life, because it's more enjoyable when I masturbate.  


**Me**

I would say that I'm attractive. Not because I think so, I'm disgusting, fat, crazy and ugly. I can't go outside without wearing makeup. When I'm at the university and I fail at solving a problem at first try, I feel really stupid and just want to cry. 

I used to get good grades and be one of the best, and I'm afraid that this will ruin all the hard work with the therapists. 

I almost never smile when I'm with him. It's only when he isn't around. The days when he isn't home are actually nice. I love spending time with my daughter and we always have a good time. 
I have told him that I'm not happy, but it's like my cries go right through him and I feel like he doesn't really care. All he is concerned about is our home and money. 

**Him** 

My boyfriend works a lot. And when he comes home, I don't care. He seems happy. Good for him.  There is not much intimacy in our relationship and I think it's natural to seek for others. I don't blame him. 

Generally he's a angry person. He yells at people when they make mistakes. I think it's embarrassing and I feel bad for the people he yells at. I have tried to help him with it

It doesn't get physical, but I'm not going to let anyone hit me again.  
He makes me feel that it's all my fault. And I'm beginning to think that it really is. I feel like I'm making a little problem huge. 


**Our daughter**

I love her more than anything else, I know that she will be devastated. This has been going on so long, because I just want her to be happy. She's growing older and I think she is beginning to realize that something is wrong. I do not want her to grow up, learning that a boyfriend/husband is not a person you are in love with. Maybe she will end up in the same situation as I am in right now. I don't want that to happen.  I want her to be happy now, and when she's older. 
 
If me and my bf break up, even if it's little things, because in her world, those little things are huge. I can't bear the thought of her reaction to the fact that the two people she loves the most in the world are going to break up.  


**Present** 

A few days ago I told him (again) that I don't want him to force me to kissing him. He couldn't understand what was wrong, I found that I had more energy and more motivation. I had a fantastic day with my daughter. She was also very happy. Maybe because she saw how happy I was. He came home, and acted like he didn't say that. I asked about it and he said that I misunderstood him. And he said that if I hate him so much, I could just leave. He just wants to stay and wait for me to fall in love with him. 

It's pure chaos. My exams are right around the corner and I'm stressed. I want to ignore this until it's over. After my exams I will have to do something. I can't continue like this. 

I'm afraid of what is going to happen if I leave him. I know that he will try to get our daughter on his side by talking bad about me

I really hope to hear your opinion on this and maybe give me some advice. And if you think that I'm handling this the wrong way


**TL;DR** My boyfriend insults me when he's angry and makes me feel bad about it. I don't feel good about myself anymore and I don't know how to solve this problem.

I know the title sounds like I'm an asshole for wanting to end it with her

I've known this girl (or should I say woman

She was always in a relationship and so was I, and never intended for the visit to be more than just a hang out. We hang out together in the past (snowboarding, barhopping, etc), but that was the first time I ever been to her place. Long story short, we hooked up and had sex that night (and I wore rubber).

From then on

We were getting quite close that it's becoming weekly thing for us and I becoming more risky during sex (rubberless and pulling out, since I also sleep around with few girls around the same time period), but she told me that she hoped the child is mine. She told me that she been wanting to have a child but her previous husband (prior to this ex-boyfriend) was sterile and she was planning to adopt a child anyway so she is planning to keep the baby. She told me that she didn't expect me to be there for the child if I din't want to.

We both have decent paying job and financially capable to raise a child so I'm not worry about the welfare of this unborn child, then I also want to be there for the baby and help support her. The only condition is that I want a legitimate paternity test to find out who's the father and I even paid for the testing.

She also agreed to keep our relationship a secret from many of our coworkers and common friends until the result is in. Due to circumstances

I've been spending time more often with her while waiting for the amnio and I actually like it. She told me that I've become her only sexual partner since she found out about the pregnancy. At one point

She told me that I was so much better person than her ex because I treated her with respect

Fast forward to couple weeks ago. I received the paternity test result in the mail and I'm NOT the father. I was relieved and perplexed at the same time.

As much as I enjoy being with her

She is a great person and good friend of mine

I was going to break it off with her on Valentine's day but I couldn't bring myself to tell her since she made wonderful dinner and other stuff that show me that she loves me.

As I said, she's jealous of the significance I place on him. 

After that, shakings her head in disbelief, and asking over and over if I was serious. She said things like ""I only pay the bills!"" and ""You waste money yourself."" and ""This money is going to ruin your life"". I was heartbroken, felt terrible, and wanted nothing more than to take it all back. But I told her that she had ruined her own life, but I wasn't going to let her or money ruin mine, and that I needed to start my own life. I told her I loved her, she said it was no problem

I told her she could ask for help if she needed it. I don't mind paying for her necessities if she's actually taking significant steps to better herself.

She's unqualified for SNAP

I became somewhat suspicious of her behavior

* Come to bed with me
* Add lockscreen passwords to her phone

* Find reasons to leave the house

I wasn't.  From the comfort of my hotel room several hundred miles away, and snuggling, all at the expense of my living room couch.  The texts only made it worse, and I continued to torture myself my watching and reading both until I couldn't stand it anymore.

So I'm pretty confused and numb right now. I want to get the hive minds perspective on the situation. 

So me (29m) and my SO (38f) have been together for almost 4 and a half years. In December 2011 we broke up and have been circling getting back together ever since then but we never did. Mostly because I knew i was going to take a job that would have me over seas for a year or two (I'm now currently over seas). During the last year we have acted like we were together without ever making firm commitments. 

We have had some issues with our relationship in the past. I was unhappy with our sex life and she was unhappy with my pot smoking. That is pretty much it. Other than those issues we had a great relationship

I only had one rule....
For there to be a possibility of us getting back together any sex she had with other guys needed to be safe sex.... No ifs ands or buts. 

If she had unsafe sex with another guy and was clean afterwards and did not tell me it was unsafe it would not have been an issue. Since I would not know either way I would just assume she followed the rule.

Well I got a phone call last night and she told me she was pregnant. I was the first person she called.  I have been over seas since September. And she is two months along. Soooooo she did not use protection. I have not asked her if she did as I got off the phone pretty quickly as I was pretty stunned. But I know she does not enjoy using condoms. 

She says she still wants to be with me and that she is sorry and feels horrible. She wants us to together. 

I don't know if she's saying that to keep me around for security. Or legitimately feels bad and just made a mistake. Or just scared. 

I don't know how I feel. I am angry that she had unsafe sex. But know its unreasonable to hold her to that since we were not together. I don't know if I could be a father or even want to be. 

I don't want to be used because she needs my money and security for her baby. 

On a side note I just spent seven grand on a vacation we planned to take together early march. Should I cancel or go through with it. 

I'm confused and horribly numb right now. I don't know how to feel

I will be over seas until October 2014. So I don't even know if we would do a real LDR if I decided to get back with her. Or even if I could trust her while I'm away. 

I only had one rule and it was shattered. Wtf do I do. 

tl;dr
Ex got knocked up. Wants to get back together. 

Edit:
Ugggggggg......FUCK!!!! Well I have my answer. I knew it before posting this but could not really bring myself to admit it. I'm going to cut off contact with her tonight when I talk to her.

Sorry

So, I really didn’t want to do it, but he persisted it’d be the hottest thing ever, yada yada, whatever. So two or three weeks ago, I did it. Needless to say, it didn’t go well; I was overwhelmed with regret, though he does bring it up a lot when he’s horny and talks about how it was the hottest thing a girl’s ever done for him. The guy I slept with is out of my life for good – he never meant anything to me. In fact

Fast forward to last night - he invites me to drink with him over Skype, and is trying to get me to stop. We pound about four or five shots in less than 15 minutes, or at least, I do… he was supposedly taking his shots off camera. Anyway, I’m feeling pretty tipsy, and he starts bringing up that night and telling me it was so hot and he wishes I’d enjoyed it because he’d love for me to do it again. I was protesting for about a half hour before he convinced me to try again. So, I text the guy, as shit is going down, doggy style

When he persisted, 30 minutes of not talking to him, I finally answered his Skype calls. I let him know what I had been doing and he didn’t believe me. I ended up getting annoyed again after he accused me of going to see the guy after he made him leave and demanded I go through my phone and texts in front of him. Thinking back, I should have, but I was pissed off and a little drunk so I refused. Then I muted my computer and proceeded to roll over and check through my phone, looking secretive about it, I guess (there was nothing bad in my phone). He flipped out – flipped the FUCK out. He broke up with me, told me I was the worst girlfriend he’s ever had, and I was appalled. I agree I should have been more sensitive to his needs and worked harder to reassure him

I’ve been phone blasting him and texting him like crazy all day, and we text constantly when we’re not on the phone.

I’m very concerned. I love him, I love him, nothing happened, etc… and nothing.

I guess I'll have to give some back story for this to make complete sense so here it goes. My parents divorced when I was nine and I went through a lot of emotional trauma involving separation and the too-early involvement of another woman on my dad's side. At the age of twelve my dad died suddenly of a heart attack, but that's another story. 

For the longest time I was depressed and dealing with anxiety and anger issues which strained my relationship with my mom

I don't know if this is normal for a woman of her age, and Saturday) and occasionally Thursdays and Sundays. The majority of the time she doesn't get completely smashed, but lately she's been getting more and more drunk while she's out. Ever since I've gotten my temps (temporary license for a teenager under the age of 16) she's had me drive her to and from the bars so that she doesn't drive while intoxicated.

Well

She went out on a lunch date with a man around noon, I saw her drive past me on the road. I immediately did a u-turn and sped up to follow her. I had to watch as my overly intoxicated mother drove, swerving all over the road, nearly hitting cars, and I felt like I was watching my dad die all over again. 

Obviously when I got home I yelled at her, etc."" I thought that maybe if it was public she would never, ever do it again. Well, after an hour of it being up I felt so bad that I deleted it and went to bed upset. 

This morning I woke up to my mom yelling at me, and that she already started getting messages about it. We both took some time to cool down, and an hour later I went to talk and saw her crying about it. She feels extremely bad about it, and doesn't remember anything except going to the bar to drink because she saw her ex with a new girl at the same restaurant she went on a date. 

I don't really know what to do. I know it was extremely stupid for me to post that

*TL;DR: Father died, and now she's getting messages from people at work. Help?*

I just wanted to think you all immensly for your responses to [my post](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1cdezn/my_boyfriend_is_becoming_famous_and_i_am/). 

Part of me feels though that I am giving a very biased view; and so it is hard for me to believe that it should end. But you have all spurred me into action. So I am going to talk to a friend of mine who can see a lot more than me. I am very embarassed and my bf has always told me to not talk to other people about our problems; but I am going to break it. All that swirls in my head whenever I see him is ""what happens when next time it isn't a pillow"". I am going to talk to her

I didn't read the thread for awhile because I was instantly embarassed and thought that everyone was going to call me a needy loser who needs to give her bf a break. The reaction was incredibly shocking to me; and interestingly, apologizing.

For now I am focusing on my own life. I have set new goals and I am keeping myself busy. I am having trouble enjoying his company or even liking him right now, fuck it. What is a reasonable amount of time to want to spend with your SO each week after 5 years? 

Also it is an international show (as in not the US) so most of you probably won't know about it ;) that is how it can have been going on for just over a month and he be on TV; its filmed semi-live.

First of all we want to thank everybody for their advice.
Since our first post we have practically talked non-stop about our relationship

While talking we realized that we have been struggling for about three years. Only the periods where it works have become shorter and shorter the last year and we both don't have the strength to make another try.

Also the problems regarding our sexlife turned out to be not as much a case of mismatched libidos but simply the lack of sexual attraction.
We asked each other how we think we will feel after the first break up-pain being gone an we both said ""freed and relieved"".

So we decided to be the good friends we already felt we are and change our facebook status to ""single"" on Valentines Day. Because one thing we will never loose is our humor.

1355259344.0,14omy5,My wife [30] of over 6 years cheated on me [27] with multiple people over the course of 6+ months.  What now?,TwitchingEyebrow,236,62,120,"I have been married for over 6 years and have a beautiful 5 year old daughter.  In October of 2011 I started noticing my wife was distracted more often and that our sex life was starting to get stagnant.  I even tried talking to her about it

It started out with ""I want to have a girls night out"".  I willingly supported it and even encouraged it hoping it would get her out of her ""funk"" that she was going through.  Before I knew it these ""girls night out"" were happening every weekend and even during the week sometimes.  I started getting somewhat suspiscious when I started noticing that she was adding a lot of people (men) to her facebook.  After confronting her about it she assured me it was nothing and that they were just ""friends"".  One night while we were watching a movie together I noticed she was playing with her phone a lot and when I asked her who she was texting she just said ""a friend"".  After feeling really paranoid for awhile I looked at her phone when she was sleeping only to find that she was texting her friend complaining that a guy she had hung out with after the bar the other night decided he didn't want to go out with her that night because he was hanging out with his buddies.  I almost lost my mind at first

After confronting her about it over the next few months I started discovering more and more guys that she was/had been hooking up with.  Ranging from making out, but her behavior continued and she basically used my house a hotel and continued to go out.  I went out of my way to please her and gave up anything that I didn't think she liked about me.  I honestly didn't know what to do until I finally had enough and told her we needed some time apart.  She took my daughter and went to live with her sister out of state for a few months.

Over this time I fell into the deepest depression of my life and used alcohol and prescription drugs (often mixed together) as an attempt to ease the pain.  Of course it didn't work and I severely damaged my career in the process and probably came closer to losing my life more often that I would like to admit.  

She eventually told me that since I didn't want her she was talking to some guy online and that she really liked him.  Over the course of a couple of months she told me that she missed me and wanted to come home and see me.  Little did I know she was just using that as an excuse to meet up with him and fuck him.  I finally drew the line and told her I was done.  She commenced with literally begging on her knees for me to take her back

A few months have passed and I'm currently living in a different country (military) for the next year.  She is living with my daughter at her god parents house right now and still tells me on a daily basis that she wants me back.  I'm completely over the whole situation and just want some closure


TL;DR:  Wife of 6+ years cheated on me with multiple people during which I was trying as hard as possible to make things work between us.  When I gave up she begged me to take her back.







**Edit:**  Thank you for all the responses.  To fill in a little more information I know it seems as though I let things go on for a long time.  Looking back on it now of course I can see that I did.  At the time though all I wanted was to stay together as a family because I love my daughter.  I know now though that she will never be happy if the parents aren't happy.  I just want whats best for her.  

Also

**Edit 2:**  Thanks for the advice everyone.  It was good to get that out there and vent a bit as well.  I'm going to pursue a divorce as much as I'm able while I'm out of the country.  I'm still keeping things civil not as a deceit tactic

For those that were wondering she never really gave me a reason for doing what she did.  She was pretty wild before we were together

So we had a brief discussion about it last night.  I did not want to overwhelm him with all the great comments and suggestions I got from this post.  BTW He is a redditor and doesnt know i posted

I first off apologize for my wording from the title of the post.  I suppose the use of ""disgusted"" was an inappropriate way to describe my feelings towards his act.  I am not grossed out by his cum, the disrespect for my things, and the lying.  I am a very emotional person, so the use of disgust was probably exaggerated (OMG i am a girl, right? lol)

So when he came home from work last night

He claims that he doesnt remember using my shirt or hiding it, he does some weird things when he is drunk and alone so it is possible.

I let him lead the conversation for the most part

I believe that its probably not a fetish issue because I have never seen any other clue that he would have a fetish I didnt know about.  He is not very open sexually

As for us not being very sexual lately, when he is stressed, he doesnt want sex (I think its weird, but thats how he was during finals in college too).  He has also had to deal with both of his parents going through cancer, which was also stressful.  

I have also not been happy with my work

I would like to thank you all, so I appreciate you all looking at it from every angle.  Considering this way my first post and I got such great feedback, next time I need advice, I will come here!  Thank you again and I hope I will be able to help someone one day like you have helped me.

I go in her room and am a little frantic. Right on her dresser

I go on to her computer. She has fb up. Her conversations with her friends teetered between mundane, no guy listed. 

But her profile picture is of her with some shaggy haired kid who looks like he's in college. On other pictures of them

Apparently they have been spending the night together
 
She still hasn't called me. I'm panicking. How do I approach this? I don't think a 19 year old with his own place has any reason to date a 16 year old. But I don't think he should be a sex offender for it or even if he could with only three years between them. Also

1366478858.0,1cr130,My (27F) housemate/host (20s/30sM) in a foreign country is getting his creep on after a week - help!,TheClitortoise,229,57,89,"Long story

I'm working in a large, a single guy in his mid-20s or early 30s who lives on the first floor. I was told another American woman would be staying here at the same time, but I learned yesterday that it fell through, so it's just me and him for (as far as I know) the whole month.

For the first few days, generously helpful. It turns out we work in the same industry, so it's really fun to talk shop. He was a great host - showing me where everything is, telling me how much I should pay for things (everything is haggled here and foreigners of course get ripped off if we don't know what's reasonable to pay), even coming to walk me home from the taxi drop off at night. The protectiveness did get kind of stifling at times: for example, when I stayed late at work because we were wrapping up a project yesterday he called to ask when I would be home and tried to talk me out of going out for a drink with my (female) coworker afterward since it'd be dark out by the time I came home (this city is basically the safest in the region, the neighborhood we'd be in is very safe, so his concern was in fact unreasonable). 

I've not been too concerned about this since a) men here are generally very protective of women and b) I understand that as an obviously foreign woman who doesn't know the city AT ALL I'm vulnerable. Of course it bugs me that I really can't be as independent as I'm used to

But then last night shit got weird. We were drinking beer and eating dinner on the roof and having a great conversation - totally not romantic, sports, religion, then talking about differences between this country and the US - when he asks if I have a boyfriend. The way he asked it set off alarm bells, so I told him that I'm getting married soon after I get back (true story is I love my live-in BF tons but we're not engaged). Then he asks if I'd consider marrying a [his nationality] man. I said no, because I have a boyfriend at home. Then he says he bets a lot of guys here want to marry me, and asks what would happen if a [his nationality] guy asked me to marry them, makes it sound sooooo saaaaad. He asks if he can ask me another question, then says ""Nevermind

Talk turns to infanticide in his country, gives birth in secret, and kills the baby (abortion is illegal here and birth control can be hard to get). Totally legit, interesting (but of course troubling) commentary. But the way he said it was so creepy because he went on this tangent about how women have biological needs, if she's used to having sex she'll go crazy if she goes for more than a month without it, and it's only natural that she'd cheat if separated from her husband. Then he asks how long I'm here (he knows I'm staying for about a month - FUCK). I pointedly did not answer, just said that's ridiculous and that people can absolutely stay faithful to their partners, and changed the subject again. And then later in the conversation he made another comment about how I'll break hearts and dudes here must be so sad that I'm not going to marry them and it isn't fair. I say I'm tired

This is extra troubling because for the past two mornings he would walk upstairs, but after last night I feel really gross and violated about it. Especially because legs are a big deal here, and my towel only covers maybe the top 1-2 inches of my thighs - the Western analog might be a male host ""accidentally"" seeing a female tenant completely topless. For two days in a row.

I don't *think* I fear for my safety (despite the last paragraph), I locked my bedroom door. I did write the woman who I arranged this with to ask if her husband, who comes from this country, might have a chat with my host. She hasn't written back yet, even though she usually gets back to me very quickly and should be awake/checking email by now. If nothing else, having female tenants be so uncomfortable they leave is bad for business. 

I'm open to leaving and staying elsewhere but would strongly prefer to stay put. I like this neighborhood and the house and the price. And, and I don't want my one unlucky experience to screw up my colleagues' future arrangements, all of which have gone really well.

Exacerbating this is the fact that several years ago I was raped by an ex shortly after I broke up with him and went to get my stuff from the place we'd shared together. This situation is absolutely triggering all the mental junk about that I thought I'd overcome - I know now that no place or person, even if rationally I'm pretty sure I won't get raped. I am worried the emotional impact will affect my stay here since I'd planned to spend today exploring, but instead I'm chilling - no, let's be honest, hiding - in my room because I don't want to run into him (I told him I'd be at the beach today, haven't seen him all day), and because I got hit on and bugged about being here without a husband this morning by a local and am just done with being harassed for the day. My fending off dudes in a foreign language limit has been exceeded; I am fresh out of fuck offs to give.

So reddit - especially those of you who live in more patriarchal countries with different expectations for interactions between men and women - what the fuck do I do? Is he just being friendly, we basically live together and it's weird to treat him like a tour guide but stop acting like roommates. I could move, but if this turns out to just be a difference in cultural norms I'd much rather resolve it - I think this guy is a genuinely good person who has just absorbed really fucked-up sexual norms. 

I so appreciate any advice. Thanks for reading my novella.

Recently I have been concerned with her judgement when she has been drinking, but I realize that college culture kind of silently accepts it as long as someone isn't totally wasted. 

I find it upsetting that she can tell me she doesn't do it when there have been several occasions when she is out and drinking, but from my experience being around her she doesn't always have the greatest sense of how intoxicated she really is. 

Last night she went to a party and I stayed back (I occasionally go but parties aren't that appealing to me) because I had to wake up for work at 5:30am. She came back to my place at 4am and reeked of liquor. She was totally wasted

The last time I brought this up to her, since my concern about her drinking and driving is totally unrelated to my sobriety-- it's illegal, it's fucking dangerous, and if something happened the consequences could be life-changing or life-ending, for her and others. 

My question: am I being controlling by insisting that she changes this behavior? I'm admittedly pretty out of touch with drinking culture and I feel like maybe my perspective is clashing with hers because I'm not a part of it. When I used to drink

Perhaps y'all have some advice or experience to share. Thanks for reading.

1370812318.0,1g03hb,I (24m) think my girlfriend (23f) might be trying to secretly get pregnant.,Riley_Duck,230,57,261,"Okay, never really had any major issues, etc.) and where we see ourselves over the next few years. However


As for why I think she may be trying to get pregnant


First, we both have agreed that I would either use condoms or pull out, since she sometimes fails to remember to take her birth control; but she recently told me that I could start finishing inside her because she ""was going to do better about remembering to take her pills."" This caught me by surprise, and I told her that I was okay with continuing on the way things were, which seemed to upset her a bit. She didn't really get mad, but she seemed really insistent on me finishing inside her and promised me that ""it would feel a lot better."" At this point I had no reason to not believe her sincerity, so I did it a few times but then told her that I just wasn't entirely comfortable because I knew she had been forgetful in the past. This comment, seemed to hurt her


At first I thought this behavior was a little strange, I finally started to get a little suspicious when she started actively questioning what I would do if she got pregnant--and by actively questioning I mean that she brought it up constantly. I told her that we would discuss that if it happened and that we should consider all options in such a situation. This caused a fight between us where she ended up crying and saying that I didn't care about her and that I was being selfish by refusing to discuss our future (i.e. specifically state what I would do if she got pregnant), but we again talked things over and I apologized, although I'm still not sure what I did wrong. 


  Things seemed to get better from there, though, she has been talking them up, if you will. That is, she has been talking about how ""fun"" it would be to have a baby and how cute they are, and she also started saying repeatedly that I would make a great dad. My only response to this has been to reminder her that I would love to have children  but just not right now--to which she has consistently responded by saying something like ""sometimes fate has a different plan for us"" and that ""we have to be flexible.""


  However, she said that it was because it was convenient and something that all girlfriends do. I tried to press the issue further, but she ended the conversation by saying that she just wanted to take care of me. As of now, she hasn't bought any for me and I have no proof that she could be poking holes in the condoms, but I feel really uneasy. I don't want to hurt her by refusing to have sex with her, but I also don't want to have a baby now. This isn't helped by the fact that she still wants me to finish in her when we have sex. In fact, it has gotten to the point where I feel bad if I don't comply, because I want so badly to trust her. I think I really would be devastated if I found out that she has been trying to trick me into getting her pregnant.


Anyway, how should I proceed and confront her about my concerns?

So we've been together for about 4 years now. We met at university


We're both from


Before I graduated, then I would work remotely from the UK, and visit the US for a few weeks at a time, a few times a year. Initially the idea of spending 2 months away from her sounded like hell, but we both saw that with the UK's economy in the state it was (and still is) in, it was a pretty damn good deal.


We were living together in an apartment that (with a little help from my father) we'd bought


After the 2 months, but this time they'd pay for her to come along for the ride too. She was still studying at that point, so came along, but only for 3 weeks.


After that, for a part-time long-distance thing. There's obviously a whole debate on that itself, but in the end, we decided that I should take it.


We came to the agreement that I'd spend 6 weeks in the US, and had two very luxurious weeks in Hawaii. 


She'd graduated with a degree in crime / law, he wanted to employ her full time, and sponsor her for a visa. If you're unfamiliar with the US visa system -- from an outsiders point of view, even those with higher education qualifications (I have a Masters degree, and I barely got in) it's one of the worst systems going. She's basically ineligible, because the US decided that the number of years spent in education outweighs the globally standardized levels of certification. An undergraduate degree in the US is 4 years, but in plenty of other places it's 3. We were told she's not even eligible to apply. Go back to school and get a Masters degree


She can stay in the US for as long as I'm there -- we're not married but there is a non-working visa for long-term cohabiting partners of people who have a working visa, because she cannot work.


Since then, on either of us. But we've had enough long, hard conversations about it, and decided that we should give it a year, and reassess things. I work for a startup company. There's a fair chance that my job won't even exist in 12 months time. My visa allows me to transfer to another company, but it might be hard to find one that's quite so lenient on me disappearing from the office every 6 weeks. So I'd probably come home.


But if my job does exist in 12 months


The trouble is; as much as we both see the upside to this, and pays about $30k. We both work long hours (both our jobs expect at least 50 hours per week, and I've worked both days of the weekend for weeks in a row in the past), and with an 8 hour time difference, communicating isn't easy. We email each other from when I wake up to when she goes to sleep, but a phone call during the week probably only happens 2-3 times, for 30 minutes


At the weekend, so I'm always available). When I'm back in the UK, things are usually excellent. At the weekend, we'll drive to another city for a couple of nights, or get a cheap flight to somewhere in Europe that we've never been. But a few weeks in, and I have to leave again.


I've come to the conclusion in my mind, I think it would be wise to ride it out. Keep collecting the pay checks until I have to come home, or if the company survives the year, stick it out and get a pretty big payout in the end. I try and remove as many negative thoughts about how this is affecting our relationship as possible; not because I don't care (which is what she thinks I do it for), but because thinking like that is going to do nothing but make both of us feel bad.


She's very good at hiding her feelings, and move on. But then a few weeks later, she'll burst out into tears and anger at how I've escaped across the world. This is usually after she hangs out with her ""friends"" (right now, people she's been working with for about a month, have never met me, and don't really know her) that just make her feel stupid; by making out that she's some sort of idiot for putting up with me. ""My boyfriend would never, *EVER*


Last night, and then we're fine again. She's always said that she doesn't want this to go on for longer than a year, but this was the first time she said ""if you're still over there in 12 months, I'll have to leave you"".

I wake up at 12:30am and realize the wife is still not in the boat. Thinking she is probably drinking with the normal late night crew

I open the door on the boat cabin and come out into the cockpit, smoking a cigarette (she doesn't smoke, never has) with her hand down his pants working it good. He is facing away from me and talking low to her, they cannot hear me due to the loud thunderstorm. I stand there for what seems like an eternity but is probably more like 30 seconds before my wife finally notices me and gestures towards me with her cigarette. She mumbles something unintelligible, the neighbor looks up and immediately jumps up and zips up his pants. 

I am immediately heartbroken, all at the same time. I can't move. He says ""my fault"" and just stands there shaking his head, my wife doesn't move or say a word. I just shake my head and walk away, then go back to help my wife walk to our boat when I realize she is still sitting there. She is so drunk she can't talk and can barely walk.

I manage to get her into our cabin where she falls down and I see that she does not have any panties on. I start to get a real bad feeling about this. I don't sleep the rest of the night and we leave early the next morning after she finds her panties in the shower house. She cries all the way home while I plot the upcoming divorce in my head.

She claims that she remembers nothing, I was stunned and still not awake at the time but I still should have done something. 

Next steps? She has said she will do whatever it takes to save our marriage

I’m working my dream job. I love it. Unfortunately, then back across the water. Rinse and repeat.

When I say Europe I mean a specific major city; I just don't want people who know me to figure out this is me.

BEGIN BACKSTORY

In January of 2010 I met a really wonderful girl in Europe. A former model, she cried, and then we spoke every day for hours on Skype. 

I was in love. Then, I was bragging about this wonderful girlfriend of mine to a friend. When he saw her pictures he did a double-take. This was the girl of a co-worker of his who also took occasional work trips to Europe. Just earlier that day he had been bragging about how he was taking a model on a romantic weekend in Paris in a couple of weeks (a week before I was scheduled to return).

I was in a daze. Couldn’t bear to talk to her. Her attempts to contact me got increasingly more frantic. Then they stopped. I flew back to Europe

By next January the Paris weekend guy was in the news again. He ranted to our common friend about his bitch of an ex-girlfriend again. How it was never good enough for him. How she kept on lying to him, and a tour guide she met on a summer vacation. All before their Paris break-up . All while she was dating me.

We finally had our confrontation. She cried and swore that she never did anything. That the water park guy was a nobody; a friend of her girlfriend’s boyfriend. The four of them went somewhere together twice but she was never interested. The tour guide was flirting with her but she rejected him, but she broke up with him as soon as she got serious with me. Said she only accepted the trip because he swore it would be platonic, and when he made advances, rejected him and both were really mad at each other and couldn’t wait to never see each other again. She just really loved Paris; she lived there for a while, almost married a Frenchman there, and kept coming back all the time just for the atmosphere and the food. 

Broke up with her then and there. She kept on calling and apologizing and about two weeks later we made up yet again. We both understood the strain on the relationship because of my travels. We soon decided to move in together and that took a lot of the edge off. We lived very happily for the next year and a half.

Then by summer of 2012 we were making plans to leave Europe and live in the US together. I had a new job lined up. I sent her on another vacation while I was on crunch time. The morning of the day I went down to the airport to pick her up, lo and behold, what’s this flash drive doing at the bottom of her underwear drawer?

Oh look it. Here’s a bunch of old homemade porn with ex-boyfriends. Here’s some with me. Here’s some pictures from her Paris trip. Well, here’s her in a restaurant with the same guy just a month ago. And what’s that. A whole set of pictures of the handsome tour guide she was totally not interested in. And there’s a XXX subfolder there. Opened it, saw some dicks and pussies, fucking lost it.

Drove down to the airport and blew up. Told her to get her things and get out.

Somehow, well, just one lunch for old time’s sake while she sat by herself in our apartment for a month. The tour guide? Was all over her, kept asking to take pictures of him (she’s a photographer). And the XXX pictures? Never had sex with him, much less took pictures. Must have been some old boyfriend she accidentally dragged in that folder while organizing it. She’d easily prove it to me, let’s open the flash drive and look at the guy’s face. She said that so sincerely, I guess that’s why I caved. Unfortunately I had smashed the thumb drive in a fit of rage

Well, but fine, I would. We got back together yet again.

A few months later my life collapsed. I lost my current job and my new job never materialized. I was in the US. She was in Europe. I was desperately looking for a job

We spoke every day. She grew increasingly more frustrated

Her birthday was coming up. We hadn't seen each other in six months. She offered to fly me to, just so we could see each other, but right at the time I was working on a pretty solid opportunity. I also felt very weird having her spend so much money on me. So I told her, well, not now, but maybe in a little while, and it’ll be my treat.

Talk to her the day before, etc. No idea what to do for her birthday, probably a little party. 

Her birthday. Call her on her cell. Get a subscriber unavailable message in French. Fuck. How the fuck is she in Paris?

She doesn’t pick up or answer for 10 days. Stalk her facebook. One of her girlfriends posts a picture of both of them near Notre Dame. Then

She Skypes me in a few days. River of tears. She just really wanted to be in Paris on her birthday, nothing ever could.

I don't give a fuck at this point

END BACKSTORY

This June. Amazing opportunity comes up in Europe. Get a great job, I’m at a yoga retreat that week. Why don’t you fly in next Monday so I can meet you at the airport. All right. No big deal. Get tickets for that Monday. Tearful reunion at the terminal. Just friends at this point. Few days later back to girlfriend and boyfriend, but it’s kind of not the same as it used to be. She has to take a weeklong trip for work. Then two weeks later she has another yoga retreat in Italy. 10 days. She has tickets with a layover, guess where. Paris.

She’s going to the retreat with three of her girlfriends. They’re flying directly there

Two days later I’m seeing off a coworker at the airport. And would you look at that. Who is that checking in across the way? Her three yoga girlfriends who she just had breakfast with in Italy.

Really chilly communication from me. She’s super happy and nice. Meet her at the airport on her return. Dying to talk face to face.

She cries and confesses. She really was in Paris for three days, the thing about me not flying in that weekend of her other yoga retreat. There was no yoga. Her other other Paris guy, not the fiancée, the other one. He was in town. They went out dancing and that was it. Just for old time's sake.

Broke up hard. Almost 10 days ago now. She keeps calling me and texting me and telling me how she’s sorry and how she never cheated on me once and how I have it all wrong. And how she’ll never have another male friend

I’m totally set on staying broken up. I’m still furious, what if it really was a series of really unfortunate misunderstandings? That when we’re together, we’re great. It’s just that times apart, which are my fault, are ruining everything. I don't care if she's hanging out with guys, as long as it's not romantic or there's no sex. And I don't know for sure that she's fucked anyone.

We’re meeting tomorrow so I can give her all the cash I owe her. There’s obviously going to be a talk. I have half a mind to just give her the envelope and run

I’ve completely lost the ability to trust her. When this happened before, and she never did?

**tl;dr**: Girlfriend keeps lying about being with guys because she's afraid of my jealousy - yet I'm never jealous

**Short Update** Had my meeting. Turned into extremely painful 1.5 hours. Walked out. Didn't happen the way I hoped it would. Turned out even better. Totally reaffirmed my decision and erased all doubt. Very glad it ended this way. Full update when I'm done with work and maybe after I get a little drunk. Tough day.

Alright, Reddit and realised just how deeply unhappy I am with my relationship. I went from confused and sad enough to consider staying with a man who had violent fits about my buying dresses on my own dime,  to doing pretty okay. I'm not elated, of course, because I did lose a good friend and a SO but I'm dealing all things considered. 

I'm VERY ashamed of myself for being so cowardly and doing it by text but if I had agreed to meet in person, I am not very good at defending myself face to face due to how emotional I get. 



How the conversation went down (not verbatim



**Him:** Your finals are finished

**Me**: Yup. 

**Him**: So come round then and we can talk.

**Me**:*[did not reply because unsure of his intentions]*

**Him**: So?

**Me**. *[no reply still. I was panicking at this point because I felt my relationship could go either way depending on what I said. All the assertiveness and anger I built up had just vanished.]*

**Him**: Are you just going to pretend like I don't exist? Seriously? Seriously

**Me**: Why now? 

**Him**: What?

**Me**: Yup


**Me** [cntd. hit text limit] The worst thing is that you don't even care about me being ""childish"" when it doesn't clash with what you think. Most of the time you think it's CUTE and you know it. 


**Him**: I told you were still holding a grudge didn't I?


**Me:** Except I have every right to be angry with how you see our relationship and how you dismiss everything I say into either ""cute""


**Him**: Will you just come over so we can discuss this in person? This is fucking stupid and a waste of time for both of us. 

**Me**: No.


**Him**: Weren't you just complaining about me calling you uncommunicative? But okay

**Me**. Thanks I guess.

[A couple of hours later]

**Him**:  Sainsbury's is doing half price on galaxy bars. ;)

**Me:** [did not reply]



At this point, why would I waste it on a relationship that makes us both miserable?


The only downside is that I cannot go to collect my belongings from his house because he **absolutely** will not let me but I think the trade-off is worth it. 


TL;DR: Took Reddit's advice,,False,,t5_2qjvn,False,,True
1364142953.0,1ax3a1,I (17F) told my mother I was depressed. She yelled at me and told me it was my fault. Later found out my sibling (20M) just got off anti-depressants. Am I missing something?,declare,239,62,59,"It's going to be a long story to lead up to, I didn't know what else to put it under (my first time actually posting on Reddit!) I am a junior in high school, work

My brother (20) attends a university, and a cell phone all of which my parents pay for. They also send him about $160 a week. He is very involved in his school. My brother used to be in the suicide program, where he would take calls of people that were feeling depressed at his school, he's in a club to welcome new freshman every year, and he was an R.A for a while, but he couldn't handle it so he stopped. He is a manager at his school store, and he is a very popular ""ladies man"". 

I, with an amazing boyfriend that helps me through a lot. I kind of messed up a little freshman year of high school, so I can't get into a university right away. My mother has always said people that go to community college are losers (keep in mind she's never even been to college) and that upsets me because that's where I'm headed. She has always treated me differently than my brother, and my older sister (30F) who graduated from a university and is a successful accountant, with a rich husband. I can see she's a little disappointed in me for not being on the same level as my siblings, but I don't see why I have to be treated differently.

My mom has always been meaner to me than my other siblings. She's an alcoholic. She is also on a ton of pills, mellow guy. He smokes weed a lot, but there's nothing wrong with that. They are the two most irresponsible adults you'll ever meet, though. My mom has always been mentally draining towards me. She's always telling me I'm not good enough, and starting fights out of the blue. I'm not afraid to yell right back at her anymore, because her fights are ridiculously unnecessary. She does it for her own entertainment, probably because she's bored and unemployed. I asked her one day while she was drunk, which is fine
What my parents don't realize is, though.

So here's the big story, was being very sincere, not blaming anybody. I said, ""I feel really down, and sad. I have for a while."" My mom said, ""So, you're depressed?"" I replied with a nod. She continued to jump up and say that's bullshit, it's your boyfriend's fault blah blah blah... Then she started to say you just want attention. Nothing's wrong with you. I just walked into my room and cried. My parents have always been harder on me than my other two siblings, I never drink, but fuck. Am I in the wrong for feeling this way?

TL;DR: Mentally abusive mother coddles older brother (20M), and that she's not taking any actions to help me because I'm ""being dramatic"".

Guy is a roommate, and just funny. He told me that he had moved here from living with his girlfriend, and that someday he would move back out there. I sometimes heard him talking to his girlfriend in the background, often times giving her his debit card or credit card numbers; or buying something online for her. It happened often enough that I started to ask my friend about it.

This friend told me it was normal, as he would talk to her while sitting in the same room. I would hear him get sad, because she had hung up on him. Then I'd watch him try to call her back several times in a row. This, I would later learn, was fairly common. I once asked him why he did not just stop trying to call her back, let her call him for once. He said ""she expects me to call her back"". 

One time, when she was looking for a reason to be mad, she brought up that he paid her phone bill late and then hung up on him. I continued to keep my mouth shut, because it's his relationship.

Fast forward a few months, and it had a bad power steering pump. My brother and I helped him fix it for close to $60, no sweat, as he just got his tax refund of about $1500. The next day, I asked him to go do something with us for fun; something involving a trivial amount of money. He said he couldn't go because he didn't have any money. He tried listing off reasons why, but could only think of his car repair and a parking ticket. I asked what happened to the rest and he said ""well I had to take care of *her name*"". I just cringed and said ""oh, I see"".

We get along quite well

Fast forward again, in addition to the previously mentioned; he is paying her rent and utilities as well. I see her making hints on facebook about how she ""needs cable"". I hear her asking him for things and he replies ""I'll have to see... how much is it?"" - I don't know what she's asking him for. I've watched her hang up on him for not immediately saying yes to something she wants. Then I watch as he tries to call her back. She knows what she is doing.

I keep my mouth shut

Remember this kid I described in the beginning? He now does nothing but sit on his computer,  -because all LDR's should have an end in sight. He replies with ""I dunno"" in a tone that clearly states he doesn't think about it. I said ""You need some finality, you can't just sit here and never see each other."" and he replies ""we've been doing it for 2 years, we're fine."" I reluctantly let it drop. It was more of an inquisitive probe, rather than a conversation. He really seemed to love her, so I thought maybe there were extenuating circumstances that I had not taken into account.

Fast forward another month or two, I ask them about her, and find out that they hate her as well. I begin asking other people what they thought. Sometimes ill-concealed malice, but mostly just frothing at the mouth hatred.

I find out that he dropped out of high school, he had to move home. This is where I come in, looking for someone to take up a spare room for a very reasonable fee. Lucky timing for him, as his father had just told him ""You cannot live here if you're sending her money"". I am his enabler, apparently.

Just the other day, and only drives to work. Example: The soles on his shoes are worn so thin that he cannot walk on hot road, it burns him. When told to buy new ones, he says ""I just can't justify spending money"". His rent and utilities are only 10% of his income, because I'm generous. ""So why go full time?"" I ask, ""because she needs more money?"" and he says -with an embarrassed tone- ""yeah"". I raged inside, but didn't let it show.

I can't handle this anymore, I know, Facebook drama is lame. I can only say that when I removed her; I didn't write, I didn't make it known, I just removed her. I mention this part, as lame as it is, because this set her off. She really liked me, and wanted to know why. I ignored this, my brother said

 He had been asking her for months to move out, she didn't want to come out. She told my other roommate that ""he has a good thing going, and I don't want to fuck it up by moving out there.""

He asked me why I treated his girlfriend ""this way"" and said something about how she probably wouldn't want to move in now. I said ""she isn't going to move out here"". He finally had something to tell her, and if he defends me at all, she hangs up on him.

I've tried to talk to him about her. He is delusional, and that no other girl can possibly compare; or that there are no good looking women in this state. His voice changes when he talks to her. Yes, there is girlfriend voice, and there is this; it's unlike anything I've ever heard. He doesn't work out with us in the garage (full bench and free weight set) because ""she doesn't like buff guys"" - the fact is, he wants to work out. This is how deep his infatuation goes. He is no longer his own person, but whatever she wants him to be.

I come home from a night out, something that he bought for $5 in a bargain bin or something that was given to him.

He should have so much money in the bank

I don't know where to go from here

Edit: I invited him out with a few mutual friends. He was bragging about his next check and how big it would be (I forget why) - and when I asked him to come riding he said he didn't want to spend any money. I said ""but you just said you were getting a huge check"" and he began lying to me about everything. I said ""I knew you would say no
I don't know how to begin here. When someone will lie to themselves, and paying his way for shit like movies and food, because I truly assumed he was a broke college kid. The fact that he could allow me to do that, when he was sending all his money to her, just irritates me. TIL I'm too generous.

TL;DR - there isn't one.

He is excited at the prospects of meeting my dad but when I emailed dad with a photo n the flight details this is what he had to say (note I have not flown home to see them since early last year since my dad had a heart attack n was hospitalised)::

Email 1: ""I hope you understand that I am in no mood to see any stupid angmo unless they are of international status or nobel price winner.

Marriage and proposal to them is just like passing shit. Does not have any meaning at all. They can divorce or kill you the next day.

I think you should seriously think of what you want for the next 10 to 20 years.""

Email 2: ""Prevention is better than cure. if you go out with somebody who has nothing to lose in punching you to pieces or even killing you, you will find that they do not have any money at all or are in debt, and usually lots of problems within the family, hopping from job to job etc etc.

Any responsible man would not propose to any woman until they are sure they have the means and a steady job to maintain a family.

Be very careful of any man who just suddenly propose to you after just a few months like you last encounter which could be worse.

There are a lot of men who prey on easy woman victims even in here.

Get yourself a small gun, then you can be sure for once.""

Email 3:
If he can send a million A$ to me

Email 4: From the scatter information I got, with nothing to lose, marriage is just a game. I seriously hope you do not fall into the trap. If he is really serious, ask him to wait for 10 years and if he remain faithful and get himself a good job and prove himself, then I would definately have no objection. I think at this moment, he is just treating you like a toy to be thrown away when you outlive your usefullness. 

Email 5:The problem with all these stupid White Man is that they just don't know how to save money. Hence their own country is going to the dogs.

Email 6: I prefer you only mix with girls. The only good successful women are those who do not marry and mix with other women for their whole life. The rest with men

I'm an agnostic atheist and my girlfriend is a Protestant Christian. We've been together nearly 4 years. I am going to be attending grad school and she is in undergraduate school. We have lived together for a year and we're pretty boring people. We're both introverts and have had maybe two fights through the duration of our relationship. I'm flexible and she's flexible. There has been no cheating or jealousy feuds. Sex maybe once per 1.5 weeks on average. You can said we are 'content' or 'happy.' We're best friends.

Around Christmas time last year a member of her close family died and she's really starting to develop her relationship with God. I've noticed her becoming more distant and I suspected it's because she's re-evaluating what she wants in a partner and in life. We've had a talk before about Christianity. She wants a Christian husband with Christian values (all of which are the same of mine; I was raised Catholic/Protestant). It's important for her partner to be Christian because it has something to do with purity of marriage and how that helps you build a closer relationship to God. She wants to better serve God in any way she can. I respect her views and her motives. I went to church with her last weekend.

About two weeks ago when I was kissing her before bed she said that she doesn't want to have sex out of marriage anymore and that doing it makes her feel guilty. I'm flexible

**ANOTHER UPDATE: I cancelled the meeting

So I broke up with him a couple hours ago (we went back to his place after trivia). I showed him the thread, since I showed him the post and he's been reading all your comments. He'll probably read this too.

**As far as the assistance he's been giving her:**

We went back and forth quite a bit - him arguing that his wife's situation in both the incidents I mentioned weren't a regular occurrence (she's about to move into a new place, events, and other stuff, and he mentioned paying for car insurance, helping her with a security deposit, etc.).

He told me there was no difference between the way he'd help out a good friend and the way he's been helping out his wife. I replied by pointing out that wife he has yet to be divorced from =/= good friend. I then asked him if he'd put up with the same behavior from me

**The reason he hasn't actually gotten a divorce yet:**

He told me they haven't gotten officially divorced because they are both too ""lazy"" (his word) to take the required paperwork wherever they need to take it. It's already signed and ready to be delivered. I've met her/hung out with her on a couple of occasions

**Regarding the sex/bunk bed incident:** 

He said he didn't think it was a big deal at all

**One annoying thing worth mentioning:**

He kept asking me if I wanted to talk to his wife so she could confirm that their relationship is 100% over/there's nothing going on between them. I was really surprised that he thought this was appropriate or would make me feel better. Maybe he's less self-aware than I thought.

Eventually, I brought up Sundance, saying that if he still wanted to go, I'd be fine with being friends, having him come to interviews, etc. with us, but suggesting that he bring an air mattress to sleep on. I also made it clear that I wouldn't stand for any attempts at causing jealousy/drama - for example, and I agreed to do the same (not that I would try to play stupid, ""I guess I should go

&gt;Him: I'm willing. I read through all of the comments to your post and they brought up some good points that I missed during my initial skimming. Would it be possible for us to meet up tomorrow to discuss it? 11:22 PM

1347435266.0,zr8p4,23F caught 25M sexting another woman; what is the best way to leave this relationship?,itstimetogonow,213,45,233,"I [23f] have decided to break up with my BF [25m] of 3 years.

I just found some inappropriate texts and pictures on his phone to a girl he dated in high school. Talking about how he wants to fuck her mouth, he wants her to come visit. He says he's moving in a couple of months, and she asked what's stopping him, and he said, ""Nothing really.""

No mention of his smoking hot girlfriend who he loves like crazy.

This all started just a few days ago, I might be able to get over it. He's depressed about not having any friends, and maybe he needs some attention from someone who isn't me.

But he's cheated on me before. He's kissed two other girls. Another girl came to me and told me they fucked, and I forgave him. I really did.

But now I know that he's not going to change. Those things didn't happen because he was wasted... they happened and will continue to happen, if it were possible? And sending dick pics and dirty text messages (especially when I don't get that kind of attention from him) is still cheating.

My problem is that we live together

Does anyone have some advice on how to prepare for a break up?

If you know you're going to leave, emotionally) independent, what steps do you take?

I already have a savings account with a significant amount saved up

Literally almost everything in our house belongs to me... or I bought it for us. Should I take everything?

I love him more than I can bear to think about right now... but I need to emotionally separate myself from him. I don't want him to know that I know about the other girl until I'm ready to leave. How do I sleep beside him

How do I let him tell me he loves me

What would be the most satisfying way to leave this relationship

Does he deserve a chance to explain himself?

How do I let go of this person who I've made so important to me...who clearly doesn't care for me nearly as much?

**TL;DR: Caught BF cheating. What is the best way to leave him? How do I prepare financially and emotionally?**

**-----------Update---------**

This has been a really difficult morning for me. I'm trying to act normal, and I don't have an answer for him... all I want to do is talk to him, and tell him everything I'm thinking and feeling, but I know if I do this before making a plan, he'll talk me out of leaving. And I can't afford to let that happen.

I know I can't stay in this relationship anymore. No matter how much I love him and wish we could work things out, and a few small things that I'll leave for him.

I have a checklist for utilities that I'll need to get shut off... the phone will probably be the hardest thing. It's only his number on the account; mine is still on my parents' account. I'll just have to take the TV with me and pay it off myself. I couldn't sell it for anywhere close to what's left on it; we literally bought it like two weeks ago.

I'm going to start looking for jobs and other living situations as soon as I get home from Goodwill. I think the deadline I'm going to give myself, I'm really scared... I've never really been alone before...and I love him much more than I have anyone else in my life. It's going to be really hard. But I know it has to happen.

His death devastated us both. But I healed. It still hurts, there's still a hole, but I can live day to day. My wife is still grieving. She cries in his room, refuses to let me box up his clothing and put it in the attic. It has crushed her. She is a shadow of the woman she once was. We've tried marriage counselling and solo therapy, and she lost her temper with me. We've been sleeping in separate rooms since- me in our room and her on the futon in our son's room.

1348455304.0,10dh1j,Please tell me why I [29m] am selfish,absolutethrowaway2,210,38,197,"So I have been building up to this question for a long time now and I think it was partially triggered by a post the other week about the guy whose girlfriend has all these strict rules she enforced with sex and how she rarely ever had sex with him.  It resulted in a ""bestof"" that made the front page

This really hit home for me as I am in pretty much the same place as that guy was.  Long story short, and a complete lack of change in these circumstances despite me communicating how unhappy this has made me over the last 1.5 years it has been occurring.

I have read /r/relationships and /r/sex a lot over the last year and half and these same posts keep getting made wherein the guy is frozen out completely by his SO.  And without fail the response is always the same.  Focus on her, sweep her off her feet, hit the gym and get in shape.  So my question is why?  Why am I the selfish one?  Why do I need to take her out on romantic dates, sweep off her feet, woo her, etc, etc?

I'll start by saying that I have been trying that, tell her what she means to me, and in general be a good husband.  And yet here I am 2 years into being married and the taps were pretty much shut off the day after I committed for life.

So why am I the selfish one?  Why is it always the guy who has to bend over backwards?  The voice that I hear in my head says ""I don't need a blowjob to be coaxed in housework.  I don't demand that she not gain weight or I won't cook meals.  I don't expect anal before I work to arrange romantic getaway holidays.""  I just really have to ask if a person made a post wherein the person they were dating stopped working right after they got married and was now just relying on the other person to support the family if someone would write a bestof post that made the front page saying ""you are being selfish saying 'I want them to work. I want them to contribute to the household.'  See how much you are saying I?"".  Would there realistically be suggestions that the person should take work to sweep their SO off their feet to try and convince them to get a job!?  I feel like the general consensus would be that this person is being inconsiderate to the other person and that they should think about getting out of the relationship.

I'll pre-emptively respond to criticism of the job comparison by saying don't bother bikeshedding 1

I feel like the only two sides I see in any of these posts are ones saying ""you need to stop focusing on yourself and work harder for her!"" or some PUA asshole talking about how whipped the OP is.  But I feel like there is an unrepresented middle ground

I'll finish this by saying that I absolutely do want an answer to the question.  I fully recognize that in my current emotional state I may be overly bitter and unreasonable.  Maybe someone here can give me the perspective I need to see that I actually am the selfish one.  Honestly

TL;DR: Why is the guy being shut off from sex (me) the selfish one?  Why do I have to focus even more on her?  Why is this the standard for sexual issues


******EDIT*****
So first I want to say thank you for all of the replies.  I posted this because I did want advice and what I saw as the advice being given in other posts just didn't work for me. In case it is not obvious I am a logical, especially when I feel that the logic and reasoning behind them doesn't work or isn't thought through.  I debated a bunch in school and to this day still approach things from a ""facts and logic or GTFO"" standpoint.  So I made this post partially as a challenge to a bunch of the unjustified claims that I had seen before.

But I also made it because I feel like being convinced of your own rightness, and maybe I just needed someone to tell me that to my face.  And I did get a number of really thought-provoking posts.  

I also appreciate people coming in from all points of view.  Whether pragmatic (suck it up anyway because you can happy or you can be right), or adversarial (you are being selfish).  I also appreciate the women posting to give some perspective on their sexuality, and although I probably started off unnecessarily aggressive I appreciate people coming from the ""PUA"" camp.  By and large I have found their opinions not the standard ""asshole"" opinions I was talking about, wherein a post is just 10 sentences of calling the OP a pussy or faggot, while simultaneously talking about dominating women, possibly physically.  Instead they have worked to express that maybe there is a more hard-nosed ""realistic"" view of female sexuality that I am ignoring.

I guess what I am trying to say is that for the most part I haven't read too many posts that were content to just throw their point out as though the self-evidence of it was obvious.  Most people have at least tried to anticipate counter-arguments and provide the logic behind their views and that is what I really appreciate.  It has definitely given me much to think about.

Before I get started

And to the people who sent me private messages, your words have encouraged me very much.
I found that indeed she enjoys watching men masturbate. I performed this for her and she found it very satisfying. At first she was very hesitant and would question what I was doing, but she couldn't look away.

We tried different positions and found some that worked well. I managed to convince her to go on top more which, before we tried other positions.
Since my last post

I suppose all is not good news. To those who said that ""something was up"" was indeed correct. I have found that she has been sharing and masturbating to a person I know. It was as I suspected

I have confronted her about this and she admits to it. She does not feel guilty as she felt that since I wasn't pleasing her sexually

She wants to have a one night fling with this person. She doesn't love him or care of him. She finds him unattractive

She asked permission. And being the spineless coward that I am, but I kept blaming myself. That this is my fault as to why the relationship is the way it is.

I am lost. I feel empty inside. I hate myself. But all I can do is just keep trying to lose weight
I have a feeling I know what everyone will say

I requested we take a break to figure things out

I was his first serious girlfriend. His first everything, and eventually asked to be back with me exclusively. Lately he has been telling me how he'd like to be friends with a girl from work. I was perfectly fine with this, but at this point it seems like he really just has feelings for her, and he is letting it interfere with our relationship. For the record, this girl doesn't seem interested in much of anything with him. He asked her if she'd like to talk outside of work, and sent her contact information. She completely ignored him. She also goes out of her way to be buddy buddy with people at work, however not with him. On top of this she has a boyfriend herself. Him and I have talked extensively about this situation, the fact that she hasn't reciprocated any of his requests to develop a friendship probably means she is just being professional. He can't live with this answer though

I understand that people in relationship develop crushes. While I think I am jealous to a certain extent at that idea, they easily faded and I always wanted to stay with my fiance.

Last week him and I had a long discussion about this girl, but now it seems he thinks I am to blame. He specifically wants to have more female friends (although he would like more of both), and he is under the impression that having a fiance is repellent for making friends. Over the years we have had married friends and friends with children, and he seems to think these kind of friends aren't good enough because people change after these life events. I have tried to explain that being single isn't going to make him a magnet for female friends, and instead he needs to work to form friendships that aren't based off of superficial things like marital status or parenthood. 

As for our own relationship leading up to these events...I thought it was good. We were finally out of debt after 4 years of struggling. We were both making money. He has his first full time job, and enjoy many of the same things. We joined a gym and have been trying to stay healthy. One of my parents died a few months ago, which has been hard on both of us, but he has really been my rock. My other parent then got very ill, and was on the cusp of death for awhile. Luckily, she is recovering now. We were under a ton of stress during this time because of constant hospital visits, and as soon as it calmed down he talked to me about his doubts. 

I would add that one other reason he has expressed that he is unhappy is because I have a physical handicap. I am not wheelchair bound, however one thing I could never do in our relationship is go on long, rocky hikes with him. He seems to resent me for this and think of me as a burden in this sense. I am at a loss at what I can do about this, since I was born this way. This is a disappointment he has talked to me about though.

So, what should I do about the girl at work? Am I wrong in thinking she is completely disinterested in a friendship with him, and letting my possible jealousy get in the way of seeing the situation straight?

Has anyone sustained a happy, long-term relationship in similar circumstances?",thraway321,234,105, can I save my marriage or is the well too poisoned? I need to know (a) if it is perfectly normal for some guys to find their partner desirable yet not display it through words/actions/expressions and prefer masturbation over sex

I'm (F27) 5'4, decent fella, yada yada.  Also important to note, I'm brown, he's white. Ever naked pic and bit of porn he looks at has naked white women. I've asked him several times if he was just inherently attracted to white women but he is adamant this is not the case. 

We've had a terrible sex life right from the beginning, I've discovered that his sex drive matches mine, he just prefers to play solo. I feel like I'm dying the death of a thousand papercuts and am now convinced I'm hideous to my husband, he'll never desire me, he'll never put me ahead of his needs. However, he insists he loves me and desires me sexually, he says he is willing to change and has made certain improvements in other domains of our relationship


Here are my reasons (which I have communicated to him several times):
*I used to initiate and get rejected 9/10 times. 
*He can go months without sex but not without masturbation
*For the most part, right before bedtime. No spontaneous sex, no experimenting with different positions, no sharing or exploring fantasies, no foreplay (In all fairness, there were a couple months were he'd initiate spontaneous sex frequently but that stopped.)
 *Generally he finishes in 5 mins, and I have to finish with my vibrator. On days that he lasts for much longer, he starts going soft while fucking me and sometimes is just unable to finish. Either way, sex with him leaves me frustrated and hurt.
*2/3 times he prefers to masturbate instead of fuck
*No matter how I touch his dick
*Blowjobs seem to work fine
*If he has been looking at porn
*If he hasn't had any external stimulation and I initiate sex
*He has never looked at me with carnal desire nor do we have spontaneous sex (expect for aforementioned couple of months.) In previous relationships, is averse to trying new things, no matter what I wear or say, nothing moves him unless he is already horny, which later leaves me feeling like a cum-dump.
*A few months ago, calls for help, he tells me that he might be a porn addict and would try the full “reboot” that they recommend in  “your brain on porn” support group – no stimuli, no fapping, re-wiring the brain so to speak. This barely lasts a month (during which we are fucking on a wayyy more regualr basis) before he needs his release.
*During that month he gets sullen and grumpy (keep in mind we are sexually active and he gets to orgasm every time), rubs one out, and now claims that he is not a porn addict and that was never the problem, so he shouldn't have to quit. 
*In 4 yrs, hoping he would eventually reciprocate. I estimate I've given him close to 200 bjs over 3.5 yrs.  
*Before we got married, and if his preference for masturbation was a deal breaker then he'd quit entirely. So far, he has broken every single promise (including all the ones not relevant to our sex life) and finally admitted that he would never quit masturbating.

Since I realize how ridiculous it is to expect someone to never masturbate (considering I need to at least twice a day, and porn (other naked women) gives him something I can never give. My self-esteem is ripped to shreds and I'm tired of feeling ugly and unwanted on a regular basis. I was never a prude and porn was never a problem in past relationships. Yet now, I feel like it has to be one or the other. I feel like I've lost out on my youth, beauty, and sanity while waiting for him to love me the way I need to be loved. Since he won't quit porn even though it means I walk out on him, does this mean we're done? Has anyone been able to get past something like this? If I stay with him, am I doomed to a miserable existence with no passion, and mediocre sex? I know the lust fades eventually but we didn't start out with any. At least

My wife is a fierce type A personality. She is good at problem solving and managing situations, and that is what I am good at, but finding another job in the industry has proven difficult. 

It is partly my fault because I don't really want to settle for a McJob. I would just strangle myself if I had to work in food service or retail. I just can not see myself being happy at that sort of job. 

I know my wife is struggling to make things work with stretching her salary to pay all our bills. She mentions it to me all the time. She makes me sit with her when we do the bills

I get that she is struggling, but now she can't even enter a room without staring me down and asking me why I don't have a job yet. She constantly sends me links to jobs that she knows I would never do/ never be happy at. 

I am trying my hardest, and when I find that place, I apply and follow up and do the best I can to get the job, but it doesn't happen.

Last week we had a fight about how she wanted to get a second job because she was tired of always being broke. She said

We have a rule now that she doesn't/won't provide me with spending money because she made that money so although she covers the basics

It is making me feel like a teenager stuck in my parents house.

I haven't really felt like doing anything lately, at one point I was talking with a woman that my husband works closely with.

I make a few comments that weren't true (I thought they were at the time... at least it was how I understood it after my husband tried to explain it to me...) and she got offended, called me stupid, and said that I shouldn't even be here. Ugh, self-confidence destroyed. Immediately after that I go and find my husband and he's talking to some old guy I've never met. I go stand beside him and hold his arm and then the old guy says something like ""Is this your wife? She's not bad looking, but I'm sure you could do better."" Seriously

I didn't know what to say so I just left. I'm glad I was able to get outside before I started crying :/.

The plan was to lay out all out for her that night and present the ultimatum that I was going to move out if things didn't change.  She got home though and had a really bad day and was upset so I didn't do it that night. We just hung out

The next day my determination was actually kinda waning as far as the ultimatum

Usually it turns into a fight, it's been over a year and nothing has changed.  I also told her how I didn't think she really believed they were going to change, but I thought that she's waiting for me to change, to get used to it.  She tried to deny it and to make it out like I was over-reacting.  Then I told her that I loved her and I knew that we could have an awesome life together, but I can't live like this and then I told her that I was going to start looking for another apt. over the next month or so.   I told if she really thought that she could make it so that things are different then I wouldn't need it, but that I was done being patient and understanding about it.  I made it really clear that I didn't want them out of our lives, but that there needs to be some very basic boundaries and we both need to stand our ground about them.

She agreed about the boundaries, but I was feeling more optimistic about things than I have in a long time.

She went over to her mom's alone to talk to them about it.  She didn't really go into details about how they reacted

Everything was good for a few days.  They still don't call the house

Now I'll tell you exactly what happened next and I'll try to leave my assumptions out of it.  I work at a diner as a cook.  I started getting complaints about the food.  Hair being in it (I wear a hair net), but I'm sure I came off as crazy and I wasn't put on the schedule this week.  He told me that I wasn't fired, but just give it a week until whatever is happening to blow over and come back.

I know it's a total assumption without proof, blah blah blah.  I hadn't really stuck to my own ultimatum as far as looking for another place, but I said I was going to and we could either move out town together, or I would get a place of my own.  She was getting mad because she doesn't think it was her sisters and told me that I was being ridiculous and that if I really need to move she guesses I should look for a place on my own.  Then she went to her mom's.  She said she was going to prove me wrong about it, but she ended up spending the night without letting me know and when she came back was cold to me.  

I tried to talk it out with her, but it's really tense and we both kinda avoid talking about her family.  

Honestly I'm not really sure what's going to happen.  I have this week off

This is usually what happens: he will walk in, I just dropped in to say hi' and then will try to force an awkward conversation. He can't remember how to pronounce or spell my name from when I told him months ago (it's an unusual one) and tries to ask for clarification often, which I fob off with excuses like 'it's fine, nobody says it right, just call me whatever'. He's tried, in various awkward, forced ways, tried to find out the name of my band (it's a guitar shop so most of us are in bands), etc. I am a poor liar and when on the spot I panic and never think of something stern to say in reply such as 'I don't give out my facebook details to customers'

He also will stare at my crotch and/or boobs if he thinks I'm not looking; this has resulted in me putting on a baggy jumper every time I see him come into the store which nonetheless does not stop him from trying to stare through it. Recently I've been staring him down pretty hard when talking to him and not breaking eye contact

I've shoehorned in that I have a boyfriend

I assumed it would drop off when it was clear I was not interested, or embarrass him; he's obese, has a lisp, English isn't even his first language and he's so socially awkward, sometimes I can see him forcing fake confidence. I feel his actions are probably born out of loneliness and sexual frustration rather than being some kind of genuine asshole, so unkindness is probably not what he needs. What I'd really like to understand is what the fuck he thinks he's doing? Has anyone else been 'this guy' in their lives and can explain what he hopes to achieve by pestering me? Doesn't he understand that it's awkward and unwelcome? Does he think over time I'll warm to him??

I started dating M 4 months ago, never told us about the other. Her and I met and had a long discussion yesterday and both texted him ""We need to talk"", so I'm sure he knows something is going down with us, but he doesn't know how much we know. We haven't said anything to him since. 

He's very charismatic, she's still pretty swept up in his charm. She knows that what he's doing is bad but since she still has strong, ""new love"" feelings for him she may not want to go to the extent that I want to go to (and may even want to stay with him!) That's fine, I will only go as far as she wants to, and I don't want to poison their relationship any more than it has been. She seems like a nice girl; I want her to be happy. I will be talking to her tomorrow about what she wants.

I want to put him in a very awkward and disadvantaged situation because he always seems to have the upper hand in one-on-one discussions (manipulative, and then spring her on him!

Anyway, if you think I shouldn't do anything about this situation except break up and urge the other girl to do the same, please tell me why. I'm pretty high on emotions right now (and excitement... this feels just like a movie!) so I am probably not thinking reasonably about anything.

It is very horrific for me to imagine a woman whom I have loved so very much, genuine, ethical people! That's who we've aspired to be together! I feel humiliated and embarrassed even if no one else finds out.

I asked her to marry me on Christmas Eve at my Grandparents farm in the middle of a lavender field. I told her we could get married whenever she wanted and that I knew I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her. She looked shocked and told me she wasn't ready yet. She wanted me to propose after I had moved back in with her this summer. She thinks we needed to plan our engagement more before she would feel ready.

Needless to say I am pretty upset and I never in a million years thought she would say no. That whole Christmas was awkward and the time since then has been difficult.

Me(29)

Our marriage is fantastic, it's always just great. I'm not sure where to start in order to get all of the facts out there, so please bear with me.

My wife is a very spiritual person. She does not practice any religion, but also spent a great deal of time talking about this ""year to live"" thing he did. It's basically where you seriously pick a day to begin living for the last year of your life as if you were to die in exactly a year. I don't want to get into everything it involves, because that's a whole different story, but in short, she has chosen to participate in this.

Her sexual history is complicated and it has really hindered her life in many ways. Now, she is very passionate about her vow of celibacy with this. I totally get this, and really do support her in this self growth thing, but fuck...a year with no sex and no sexual acts! 

I love her to death, I'm not sure if it will suffice for an entire year. 

Has anyone ever been in this situation? Our relationship is very open and I honestly know that she would not be upset if I had a one night stand here and there as long as I am safe about it and she knows about it. I guess I'm just hoping for some encouraging words or any advice from someone who has been in a similar situation.

We've been together for just under 10 years now. These are the deal breakers in no particular order.

-She doesn't have her license. Probably not a big deal for some but I have to drive her to work

-Poor diet and lack of exercise. Typical

-A lack of independence. She won't make phone calls for important things for herself like making appointments or banking. If I'm out for the night and there's no food she'll text me saying she's hungry instead of walking a block away to the grocery store.

-She can be a passive aggressive nightmare. Instead of arguing with me she'll just hide in the bedroom all day and not talk. If I leave she'll send me a lengthy text about why's she's upset which just makes me more angry than before.

Now I can't handle it and I want out. ,hardlyaperson,238,70,294,"My wife (30 f) and I (32 m) have been married five and together seven. Before the car accident my wife and I had an amazing relationship. She was my best friend and our little family was my life. A year and a half ago my wife, possibly for the rest of her life. She also has problems remembering things thanks to a head injury she got when a tree went through the windshield. She can remember most basic things but she gets confused easily and will sometimes start entire conversations over and over. 

I was banged up for a while after the accident (broken ribs) but for the most part I got pretty lucky. I now spend the majority of my days caring for a wife that is in the situation because I drove angry. 

She really wanted children. We tried for so long. About three years ago she got told it wouldn't happen for her so we invested our entire savings and took out another mortgage to try IVF. The first series failed but we got lucky with a second try. That kid was suppose to be our miracle. 

My wife can't forgive me. She can't forget. She cried all the time. Sometimes she forgets that she lost the baby and touches her stomach and asks me what we will name him. Then she will remember and just lose it all over again. It is soul crushing. 

I recently connected with an old friend from college who has really helped me through the pain. A woman who I know trust with my everything. We fell in love, and I still love her but I don't know if I can be with her anymore. I hate to be thinking this but I would give my everything to move on from this life and start a new one with this new woman. I want to try for kids again and my wife can't. I want to be happy and live a life. The life I live now is nothing. I talk to my wife about it from time to time and she gets notably upset but says she won't keep me from it. I can tell she is shattered though. 

We are both in therapy and the therapist has encouraged us both to stick it out

Am I a bastard for wanting to leave this situation and move on? Her parents are older and she has no siblings. I honestly don't know who would take care of her. She can do most of the day to day stuff by herself but she does need help lifting herself

I feel guilty but I can't handle it anymore. Any help would be appreciated.

He lost over 80 pounds right before we met so I never knew the ""fat"" him, this is causing problems.  He went from getting absolutely no attention from women to constantly getting hit on and it makes me nervous/sad/jealous.  I can tell he likes the female attention and that's understandable considering he's been deprived of it almost his entire life but I can't help but feel... jealous.  

It doesn't matter where we go, but he's mine.  On one hand, I want to say something to him but on the other hand, I'm afraid to because I don't want him to think I'm a psycho girlfriend.  

I could definitely see myself getting married to him.  He's *that* kind of guy.  He's special to me and he's not like other men.  My boyfriend treats me extremely well and he doesn't even compare to any of my ex-boyfriends.  I feel like he's in a league of his own - That sounds cheesy but it's the truth.

Has anyone ever been through this before?  What's the best way to handle his other female suitors without making things worse?  Thank you!

I won't say I don't know what happened to put it in his head

I know for a fact I wouldn't enjoy it it, I relented t a MFF threesome and hated everything about it. I didn't enjoy touching her, and I sure as shit did not enjoy watching them fuck. I tried it, and I don't like it. And it that make me a prude or something, then fuck it. I guess I'm a prude. 

My bf constantly brings it up. Before sex, watching TV. Just constantly. Not only that, but it seems like he already has the whole thing planned out without my permission. He has the girl he wants to do it with picked out, and has even asked her if she's interested. We got into a huge fight about him asking her. To me, that's crossing a major line. I can deal with a little flirting, or him checking out another girl, but seriously. Too much. 

Recently though, but it doesn't seem to matter. This seems to be his dealbreaker. He absolutely has to do it or he won't be content in life. Have a threesome, or I'm an awful girlfriend. 

Am I being unreasonable? Should I just suck it up and go through with it so he can be happy

I don't know. There doesn't seem to have a mutual meeting point here. One of us is just going to have to suffer. 

TL;DR: I know from past experience that I want nothing to do with a MFF threesome. My boyfriend acts like his happiness in life absolutely depends on having one. We can't find middle ground.

Thanks so much for all the comments on the original post. It really helped me to make a decision without feeling guilty. I'm very excitedly getting ready for my birthday this weekend! 

I didn't end up confronting the bride, I told her my reasoning and she thought it was very fair. She thought it was really strange that I was never contacted directly as I don't live with my Mum, I am an adult renting my own house. She feels like hired help herself when it's her best friend, she said she'll go through with it anyway because the bride has helped her in the past. My sister and I have had a bit of a falling out so I don't know what she's doing. 

I talked briefly to my Dad who had no idea that the wedding was this weekend. He was surprised at first, said he'll send them his well wishes and that it's sad 20+ years of friendship has all turned out like this.  

Glad I'm not going to be a part of this weird emotionally charged wedding. 

TL;DR happily not going to the wedding. The no invitation seems to be caused by the husband to be's cowardly attitude

Our relationship has been full of highs and lows.  We tend to hit rock bottom and then pull everything back together.  Rock bottom being a weekend of drunken shouting matches and general not-getting-along-ness.  At our best we are totally in love

Lately, but then dropped it.  I didn't convince her out of it, we came to a mutual understanding and were going to focus on our relationship.

Last night

Turns out she cheated on me.  

She was constantly deleting his texts and only had the last two days worth.  She was going to go out with him that night but he had gotten high and fell asleep (yea he's a real winner).  I made some racket and she woke up - I confronted her immediately about it.

She confessed that she had sex with him, she has been seeing him for about a month and only about 3-4 times total.

**[EDIT]** He is a coworker of hers for a job that ended last week.

I told her it was over between us (I thought I would have shouted more, and me trying to accept what happened and not give in.

She then told me that the last time she saw him, but even if it is true and she was breaking it off, I can only believe that she would have kept seeing him if he hadn't turned out to be such an enormous douche.

This morning I made her pack her things (not all of her things

I am furious at her and I have been extremely militant responding to her saying basically that we are done and that we don't have a future.

Everyone, heartbreaking ending to this story. I haven't posted an update since because I couldn't bring myself to post it sooner, due to being drunk and upset most of that time. 

I told her to quit her job

She then basically told me she didn't want to be with me any longer. She originally said she wanted to stay with me for the children but now realises she can't stay with me anymore. Apparently I'm not attractive, each reason felt like a crushing blow to my confidence and my heart, as cliché as that sounds. She told me this on Saturday morning. 

She left an hour later with her stuff to go to his place (for those who said, they had the kids for an extra couple of days. I'm actually glad I didn't have to go through this meeting, as she probably would have ended it there in front of him which would have been more embarrassing.

I even liked the idea

Well, but that's not it. I think a better way to put it might be... She treats sex like it's something she has to do for my sake and I can tell. She doesn't come, but tells me that ""it's okay"". That she doesn't mind. I try to make her to come but she always conjures up some kind of an excuse and then tells me ""I don't want to fake it and lie to you."" I proposed ideas to spice it up, but she doesn't like toys and thinks any kind of role-playing is ""silly"". (To be fair, she did give it a chance and it was silly.) I point-blank asked her what her fantasies are and she said she ""doesn't have any"". I was actually surprised at this and didn't believe her at first, but she re-assured me until I believed her. Now, I genuinely think she's telling the truth. I don't know if that makes me feel better or worse. Also, I have a 1/100 chance of getting sex any time I try to initiate.

And here's the worst part: I love my wife, it feels like we're just roommates or something. And it didn't used to be this way. When we first met, we were all over each other and we fucked like rabbits. And, trust me, she came back then. We had a ""bedroom towel"" because she'd get so ridiculously wet.

I love my kids and they're also strictly filed under the category ""people I would jump into a volcano for"". It's just... I'm not sure I particularly adore being a ""parent"". I know that sounds fucking awful but there is a loneliness to it that I wasn't prepared for. And there's a stigma -- stigma is the wrong word, is always saying stupid shit. It's so obvious that he doesn't think I'm worthy of his little girl and that's fine. That's his opinion. But the fucker actually, and I swear, I'm not exaggerating this, told my wife that ""he found her second husband"" and gave her some guy's business card. While I was there. When I acted surprised, he gave me the ""Relax, I'm just breaking your balls"" routine but who the fuck does that. I wanted to fucking punch him.

I feel trapped and soul-sapped. I feel powerless. I feel like pre-cancer-diagnosis Walter White. And, hey, talk about a first world problem. I'm well-taken care of, I have a lovely wife, I have two smart children. Meanwhile, all but one of my friends is already divorced and one of them is going through an ugly custody battle.

Last week I was having a beer with one my buddies, I wasn't hitting on her, I didn't even initiate the conversation, she thought I was someone she knew.) We joked around -- she called me boring, I retorted that I used to be in a metal band -- and I made her laugh. I was smooth, I was a... person. Nothing happened, obviously, I'm not stupid

Sorry, fuck it, some children in Africa are dying of hunger every six seconds and I'm here whining. I mean, actually, fuck that, I don't need to go to another continent, just looking through the problems people have here -- drug addiction, insane people -- my problems are just funny in comparison. But it feels really real to me.

So, facebook messages, etc. I had received throughout the day in privacy, I suggested we talk.

I tried not to get into too much detail

I said to him straight up that he just wasn't what I was expecting and I didn't have any romantic feelings

He seemed completely fine with me in real life vs. internet - I was apparently the only one having the trouble conditioning myself to the fact that he was nothing in person like he portrayed himself on the internet....

He gave me the silent treatment, if he wanted to stay he could have my couch or daughters room (she was away for the week), or he could find a hotel, or he could use my phone and internet to change flights if need be. Whatever he wanted to do.

He went off to my loungeroom to sulk

The next morning, and told him I was putting a lot of trust in him being at my place considering I don't know him at all in real life, and to please respect my privacy.

When I came home from work, and I'm beginning to feel uncomfortable even with him just around me.

He asked to use my phone and computer to check flights and hotels, he eventually booked a hotel, and asked me to drive him there.

On the way he was digging for more information about why I don't feel a connection. I didn't want to say ""because I find you as repulsive as a Gollum physically and the idea of you flopping around on me makes me physically sick, for HOURS, is not fun!!!"", because that is hurtful, I just simply repeated myself that I don't feel what I thought I would, and I don't feel comfortable around him.

He got very bitchy at this point.

He mentioned that my house was ""easy to break into""

He said

He said he wouldn't give me an apology for anything.

I simply said that I am not asking for an apology

Curiosity got me and I checked my internet history....he was at my house all day

He knew I was going to my best friends leaving party on the weekend

And today I found out that he had asked a mutual friend of ours to spy on me and report back to him anything I say about him (after he had a dig at me in one of his statuses about ""unexpected hotel costs""). But I am not the kind of person to unleash personal info on my friends in such a public manner like that....I apologised to our friend that he was dragged into high-school drama that is so petty and incomprehensible. 

He sent me a huge email outlining everything he liked about me, and that I am apparently lying to myself and I'm a narcissist, all while admitting he has a big ego...

Honestly

He also said that a working relationship doesn't need the ""feeling"" I am after romantically.

Okay. So there were quite a few questions in response to my first post

1. If your family was helping your ex, probably due mostly to my ex's controlling/abusive ways and the servicemember's irrational fear of seeking mental health aid. I could have said no to the one year overseas assignment, but because he had me convinced I was a shitty mother, I thought they were better off without me. Two months into my assignment and finally seeking help with my depression, I filed for divorce.

2. Your ex's brother his helping him? Your husband's brother? I'm so confused. A. This is my sister's husband

3. What sort of custody agreement do you have? A. None. We have joint custody and a divorce decree that does not specify any kind of visitation rules; I know now this was badly done and a huge mistake on my part for agreeing to it. Again

4. Was all this in Texas or Oklahoma? A. We were married and divorced in Oklahoma

5. WTF?!? WHY YOU WEIGH YOUR SON AFTER DAD'S HOUSE?!? A. It started as a sort-of growth chart. His doctor has always mentioned that he seems underweight for his age, and I started to notice that he was not only not gaining any weight over like 5-6 months, but that he was actually LOSING weight after having been at his dad's.

7. Child support? A. I never asked for any, because *$43 a month*

If I missed any other major questions

The first lawyer I met with, telling me that I might not only not get full custody, but that I might also be required to pay child support to my ex. He also recommended getting a second opinion. Done. *next*

Quick sidebar: I did receive some texts from my ex finally, no problem) and putting in writing that my son would attend school in the school district in which my ex lives. The reason I won't agree to the school district is because, being in the military, I might have to move. I'm not going to set that in stone.

Any requests regarding when I can see my son again are met with 'not until you sign my paperwork' from my ex. He did not return my son to me on Sunday and took my name off the list at my son's daycare

My sister has now openly involved herself, and they've hit a dry spell with jobs lately. My parents were going to give them some jobs to help them get through a slow time, but are now refusing until they fire my ex-husband. While I certainly appreciate having such support, I cringe a little inside at the divide this has caused in my family. 

I have spoken with *quick tally in brain* 6 or 7 lawyers since this started. I'm doing research and shopping around this time

The plan now is full custody

After my several calls to the police department to have them to welfare checks at my ex's house, but suffering financial strain as a result of this mess.

I have appointments with three lawyers tomorrow

Following the advice of several lawyers, JA, and Family Advocacy, I have started gathering my evidence. I have photos and the insurance claim paperwork from when my ex fell asleep at the wheel with our (then 9 month old) son in the car, rolling off the highway, and submitted a records request to the relevant police department for the actual police report of the incident. I have photos my ex sent me while on that trip (unfortunately with no datestamp) showing him letting our son play with a hunting rifle. I have the medical records that show that his father was denied clearance to come with me overseas, as well as documentation from a mediator showing that HE would not allow ME to take our son with me. I have submitted another request for the police report from the one time I actually called for help when he was beating me(he'd loaded a shotgun and pointed it in my face), so no help there trying to show how he would take most of my paycheck and buy guns and ammo. I have pictures of the bug bites from his dad's house. I have backed up and exported copies of all of his texts to me.

There's more

To quote a line (in various forms) from MANY novels: Wishes build no bridges. I've got to work with things the way they are, and sent hopeful messages my way after my first post!

I'm talking to him about it right now.  Alice was just diagnosed with very early stage endometriosis.  Here is what he said:

I've found out that since the day of my abortion

This all came out after an incident last week led to me to snooping around. I asked him about why he was doing these things and he said that since the abortion, and thus he feels less need to act like a responsible adult/husband.

I don't know where to go from here. Honestly my trust is completely shattered from all the secrets. I had no feelings about the abortion until now

How do we talk through this? I'm just not sure what to say to make him feel better, but thank you for any advice you can offer.

**TL;DR: I(25) had an abortion. My husband(28) is not handling it well. How do I make this better?**

**Edit:** Umm geez

1. Of course my husband knew I didn't want children before we were married. It is not a secret, we agreed that we would have children **A)** after I graduated from college and  **B)** once he got to the point where he made over $x a year. I would be a SAHM until all the children were in grade school, and then we would decide if we wanted to home school or figure something else out. This is what we **both** wanted. Neither of us want to send our children to daycare, and both of us want to make the most financially sound decision as to how much we work. In 2009 I was a junior in college and my husband was due to make $x, right on schedule. Suddenly the company he had been with since college decided to sell to a larger one and lay everyone off, with offers to rehire for an insulting amount. He sent out applications for ELEVEN months until he got a call back, still from someone wanting to hire him for less than he was making before. He quit just before I graduated
So I went to work, limited attention, and few of the experiences that a child deserves to have. When I said I ""convinced"" my husband, this is what I meant. Only that I presented this information to him. I thought that he understood and agreed with me. I cannot raise a child the way I want to and the way HE wants to, without our income being higher. Even if that means that I have to work harder so he can stay at home, it's okay. But I can't give that to him right now. If I wanted to make this decision by myself, I would have had the abortion in secret and not have told him. I told him because I wanted us to come to an agreement. It is clear that y'all feel he was bullied and I see that now. I wish I had seen it then. I truly thought that he could see it was not the right time. I never wanted to wait this long to have a baby either, and this pregnancy has only made him desire one even more greatly.

2. This is not a simple predicament and I am very sorry for what I have done to my husband. I am sorry to all of you if I came across as being self-absorbed. My question I meant to ask was

3. This was not a planned pregnancy. We have never

4. I have spoken to him and he seems more settled now that it is out in the open. I think he just wants to be comforted. We'll see what happens.

I asked him if her ex partner was skinnier than me and he said ""what do you think my answer will be? Isn't it obvious?"" he basically told me that she was skinnier every single way. I am not dumb.

Could there be something else going on?,throaway44,211,49,163,"My husband (33) and I (f27) have been married 4 years. We returned from his work conference in Miami. We don't have a lot of money so it was a nice getaway for me. Everything was paid for by his job except for my flight. He had the luxury of choosing his own flight so he chose one on which I could also get an affordable ticket.

I knew we wouldnt have a lot of time together but I took the opportunity to get a few days to myself. I was alone most of the time but I had fun. On the last night there was a spouses' cocktail reception where an employee's SO could join in (about half the people there brought their SO). It started at 8. I get ready and wait for my husband to join me.  By 830 he shows up and says its canceled. I was confused so I asked him why and he told me everyone was drunk. ''Do you really want to go up there?  We can go.''. Then I said

 At this point I was kind of mad. I had just spent the last hour getting ready. He could have texted me this information and I would have happily put on my PJs and watched a movie in the hotel room. But he didn't. And on top of that I didn't really believe it was canceled so I was annoyed by the possible lie.

 The next day we re flying home and the flight is delayed by 2 hours BC a flight attendant called in sick. Well according to my husband, he could have taken a more expensive flight. And he only got stuck on this cheap airline bc ,''I HAD to come along ."" Apparently flight attendants dont get sick on expensive airlines. This was said to me in front of the other passengers in the terminal. I was mortified 

When I later tell him how ridiculous his logic is (when we're at home BC I don't like a scene) he tells me that I'm really annoying when he's trying to work. And that for the next conference I'm definitely not coming. It was pretty hurtful and I felt myself starting to cry so I left the room. 

I'm not sure how I'm annoying. I rarely text him when he's working. And if I do and he doesnt respond I do not text again. I just assume he's busy. Sometimes he replies a couple of hours later apologizing and my response is usually

I don't even call him when he's working. I feel very hurt by what he said and on top of that I'm confused. I would never treat my husband like he was an inconvenience.

We have all known each other since early high school. At least 15 years. In 2011

There are 4 couples involved in the whole story:

A- 27f &amp; 27m-married for one year

B- 27f &amp; 28m - living together

C- 27f &amp; 31m - my bf and I

D - 28f &amp; 29m - the bff and her fiance. Moved to a different city in 2011. 2012

So it comes time and we start talking budget in a Facebook group. This whole time

Now they are telling us to expect 1700-1900 per person. That's the range that the travel agent told them to tell us would be a safe amount to put away. 

Well... this caused a bit of an uproar in the group. They were ok with having to spend more to go to our friend's wedding and try to be there for her

The thing is... we have a opportunity to go stay at one of the villas

I brought this up to her during a recent phone call

She's upset that we would stay at a different location because we are in her wedding party and it means that we wont get to spend as much time with her. She imagined that we would be staying at the resort the while time. 

She said that she told us 2 years in advance to give us time to save up for the trip. 

From our point of view:

1) She lives in a city where in income is higher and cost of living is lower. The townhouse that she bought in her city would EASILY cost 1.5 times more in our city

2) Bff thinks that we will be spending the entire time in the resort and there is no need to go anywhere else. The group wants to go for excursions, might as well explore it. 

3) She has other guests coming with her (about 15 other people) and it's not like she's going to be spending her entire time with us. 

4) We were never consulted about what we were comfortable with paying. She's unhappy even if we were to stay at the resort next to hers

5) Everyone know that weddings are expensive. It seems unfair that we would be subsidizing her wedding at our expense. Especially when we also have things to budget for ourselves. Ie: engagement (B)

I tried suggesting that she join us at the villa and then meet up with her other guests later

Surprisingly, and you know how much it would worry me. You guys would be driving at night, when you'd be tired and visibility would be low.""

I told her, and that (friend's name) isn't going anywhere. But the opportunity is here now, and I want to go, and I think that's a good enough reason.""

And without warning, she told my younger sister (who was also on the line), ""And if you agree with your sister, then you broke my heart, too."" She got so upset that she couldn't talk anymore, and she just walked away from the phone (it was on speaker).

At this point

* ""You know it's not like we don't want you to be happy or have fun. Your mom is just really worried about you. She loves you.""
* ""Think about how much your mom has done for you. There are some things she does for you now that even I don't understand why she does them (e.g., you should really take that into consideration. It's not often that she feels very strongly about something.""
* ""If I had any opportunity to make *my* parents happy
* ""I understand where you're coming from
* ""You say that you're not trying to hurt us
* ""Look,  is this trip--your independence--more important to you than what it would do to your mom?""
* ""If you feel like you need this right now, then do it. But up until this point, you've been letting it happen gradually, right?""
* ""You have to decide: what's more important? Your family or yourself?""
* ""If you go on this trip
* ""I'm not trying to make you feel guilty. I'm just saying.""
* ""I'm not trying to make you feel guilty. I'm just reminding you.""
* ""I'm not trying to make you feel guilty. I just want you to know.""

It would have been easier if he had been yelling at me. 

I didn't say much during this. The conversation ended with my dad telling me to take some time to think about it

The next morning

&gt; I found your mom awake crying in bed this morning. Her eyes are swollen because of how much she cried. If you think you are grown up, then you know what to do. Call me if you don't. We have sacrificed so much for you over your life. Ask yourself how much you have done in return. Actions speak louder than words, especially in times of need. Ask yourself what you value most in your life.

I know my mom was overreacting, she'd take my decision to mean that I cared more about myself/hanging out with my friends than her, and that would cut her so deep, I don't know if our relationship would ever be the same.

So I decided not to go. It's not a decision that I'm happy with, and anguishing over whether I really am an unappreciative daughter for being so dismissive about my parents' concerns. It's all I've been able to think about for the past few days, and it's really taking an emotional toll on me.

I don't know how to proceed from here on out. I'll be seeing my parents this weekend, but I'm not really sure how it would go since I don't see any possibility for compromise when it comes to my desires vs. their ""legitimate"" concerns.

She came to visit last weekend and we were having a great time until I went out for a cycle and came back to find her flustered and closing tabs. I reopened them and found she had been in the history

I asked her what she had been looking for but she would not tell me, there was really nothing I had to hide.

I found the post-it corresponded to some messages to some male friends. All the 5 minutes I was looking she was yelling for me to let her back in
I eventually let her back in and got her to calm down as she wanted to leave.

When I got her to talk about it, I sent her ""sex bomb"" by tom jones as a joke and she alleges that in between those messages I was looking at my ex gf's profile. This had actually happened at a different time a day later and it was evident she had copied it down wrong.

Edit: Can't believe I missed this out - I had not looked at anything to do with the ex-gf since december when history indicates i looked at some pics. GF thinks she might have accidentally deleted this but I see no way this would happen and I certainly have no recollection of it.

While I have nothing to hide I was quite upset about her seeming lack of trust and breach of my privacy. Even if the ""you've nothing to hide you should let me search"" was valid

Is it normal for SO's to look through messages and browsing history? I've never looked through hers.

We decided to close the marriage again and she promised to stop chatting with all guys without my knowledge (besides some guy friends she knows in RL) until we could build some trust back up. I also told her I would no longer snoop on her stuff

I was getting a weird vibe again so I ashamedly snooped on her texts. One her BFF's husband was chatting with her

So this morning she confronts me about snooping on her phone. I explain that I had that weird feeling again and how I saw what he was saying to her and how I thought it was really inappropriate. She says she didn't send him anything and asked what she should say to him. I thought she should make it clear that she will not send anything like that and if he says that again she will cut off all communication. 

**TL;DR:** So why do I bring this up? We clearly have trust issues. Am I right for being upset about how she handles a guy that asks for nude photos? Am I a huge asshole for snooping into her stuff?

My fiancé and I had a long conversation about this and there is more to the story than I was aware of initially (surprise, punching walls…no physical abuse) and tendency to bully, but he had also done a ton of work on himself, stayed single and lived alone for along time before we met, and gone through a lot of counseling and he believed he had it under control. Unfortunately he is going through some family issues AND trying to quit smoking which is making him even more on edge than he would be otherwise.

I had no idea he was struggling with this because he has completely kept it to himself and not acted on it. He decided to re-enter counseling on his own and didn’t tell me any of this because he didn’t want me to be afraid of him or not feel safe (I’ve never really seen him lose his temper, like not being able to find his other shoe in the morning or forgetting to set his alarm and oversleeping and he has been fighting urges to take it out on me just because I’m the one that is there.

I love my friends and family. I'm lucky

I have what feels like a nigh-pathological inability to let others know about my failures. And this has manifested in very bad ways since I graduated high school.

Senior year, sank into a depression, and became fixated on my long-distance boyfriend. In a move I still don't understand, I failed the two classes I was captivated by and scraped by in two classes I found boring. This resulted in academic probation. 

That lit a small fire under my ass, saying I'd gotten decent grades. They had no reason to doubt me.

Sophomore year, and I led them to believe I was going back for my fourth semester. Instead, I crashed on friends' couches for a semester and worked small cash-paying jobs. At one point I traveled fifteen hours away from my home to work a two-week gig, and I was constantly waiting for my parents to discover the awful truth.

They didn't. When the semester ended, I went to community college halfway in between my home-city and my college's city, trying to improve my GPA to get back into the college my parents thought I was attending. I got a 4.0, but my dean balked on some administrative matters and I was told I wouldn't be able to return until the next fall. 

I felt like I was *so close* to fixing my situation, and I set off for a semester in a foreign country, where I *did* attend an independent study abroad program.

I got great grades, put my nose to the grindstone, and be done with the school I hated in a few short semesters. 

Halfway into the semester I came down with a bacterial infection that wrecked my life for a while. I was getting treated for it at the college health clinic, I couldn't intercept the letter, which informed my parents that I was being put on a year of leave due to my low GPA. They were *insane* with anger, but I still covered up the truth. I told them that it was the sickness that derailed me for one awful semester, and they determined that I would stay home, get treatment from a proper doctor, and take a few classes at a local college.

So I have been home this spring semester, and I'm in perhaps my first healthy relationship, with a kind and stable guy a few years older than me. 

No one knows that I attended a total of three semesters at my college. It hasn't been an issue all semester, but since then I've been consumed with panic and anxiety about what to do.

I want to stay in my home-city, I want them to *never* know; they both have heart problems, and I am seriously worried this could cause a severe reaction, like a literal heart attack. 

The anxiety is making me shut down a bit inside. Part of me wants to cut and run: leave them an apology letter explaining that I need some space

I have been consumed by guilt about this for three years

Sorry to make this such a long one. I think it can actually be summarized quite succinctly: 

**TL;DR: In order to avoid my parents' disappointment, instead of decent grades in six semesters. I don't know how to salvage this situation. Ideally, I would keep them in the dark in order to not risk aggravating their health problems.**

1358540665.0,16u3ub,I am jealous of my coworker's relationship.,throwaway61626364,209,49,103,"Throwaway since my girlfriend sometimes uses my daily username.

A little background: I [26/m] have been dating my girlfriend [26/f] for two years and living with her for one. We have a solid, but doing our own thing, Redditing, etc. We try to plan a date night once a week, but that usually turns into take-out food and a movie on Netflix, since we don't have much disposable income. She rarely comes to my work functions because she thinks the girls I work with don't like her (that's not true, or at least I haven't seen it). I'm very happy with her

One of my coworkers (25/f) is working with us before she heads to law school in the fall. She's dating an older guy (32), but she graduated college at 20, so I don't think their infatuation with each other is the result of gold-digging, which is what I originally assumed. 

They seem to be a perfect couple. She raves about how proud of him she is and how much respect she has for him. Even when she's gabbing with the other girls in the office about a little fight they've had, they have a standing breakfast date every time he works an overnight shift. 

He reciprocates from what I can see. He comes to work functions and brags about how brilliant she is and how he was lucky to find someone that pretty and also interested in him. He picks her up for lunch sometimes. They travel all over the place

I've tried to do little things to make my girlfriend feel special, or she is gracious, but rarely returns the favor.

I know part of my jealousy is over the fact that my girlfriend and I can't afford to travel or spend nights out on the town like they do. But something about the way they talk about each other and look at each other makes me feel like something is missing in my relationship.

1343895963.0,xjzap,Sexless marriage. Affair. Suicidal wife. Need advice. ,throwawaycheatr,199,40,121,"
I'm 35 and have been married for 12 years. Sex was pretty good and frequent before getting married

For the past 10+ years we have been having sex less than 10 times per year, planned, romanced, etc, she still refuses my advances. Even worse, the past two years she has started feeling pain on those rare occasions when we do have sex. 

About 7 years ago I was at a bar and ended up making out with a girl I met. She invited me back to her place; on the way there I changed my mind and went home. A couple days later I told my wife that I was seriously thinking about sex with other women

Things improved for a few months, but when the time came she would be too tired or have another lame excuse. 

About 5 years ago I simply gave up. I mostly stopped initiating sex, I feel more like roommates than spouses. Despite all of this, I love and care for her very much; I know she loves me too.

I've thought about divorce on many occasions, etc. 

After years of a sexless marriage, my wife found out about it.

When confronted, but I do have sexual needs. With a trial separation I was hoping we could both date and maybe she'd realize we're not in love. She will not agree to either option and wants to try to work it out.

Since she found out she has hurt herself on a few occasions by pounding her head on the wall/floor, but I have been able to calm her down. She has now promised me she won't kill herself, but I'm not so sure.

We have gone to therapy, I no longer want sex with her. I can definitely go through the motions, but I'm not into it. I still find her beautiful, but maybe after so much rejection something between us has broken.

At this point

Any advice would be appreciated!

I've always been a bit of a hopeless romantic and IMO treated her like a princess during the course of our relationship.  There was even a good period of time that I supported her entirely while she looked for work post college.

Well, needless to say, devastated, but I try to piece my life back together.

A few weeks go by and the roommate of one of my groomsmen calls me because he ""needs to get something of his chest.""  He's known for a while that my ex-fiance and one of my best friends had been sleeping together for a while and couldn't carry the secret anymore.

I haven't spoken to either of them since this incident but it's been well over a year since everything happened and what I'm asking my fellow redditors is how does one get back out there when they have such crippling trust issues?

From the beginning of of our relationships I made it clear that I'd be making this move -- the decision definitely was not an impetuous one

The lack of end-date for the long distance has caused some tension in our relationship. We argue a lot more now, but again, there are no real dates or plans set. It is our deep connection and love that has helped me overcome the distance, and it's been enough... until now. 

I fucked up. I had a moment of weakness and slept in another man's bed. We didn't have sex or hook up, never thought I was the cheating type, and I want to spend the rest of my life with Bob. I honestly can't imagine what was running through my mind when I let my guard down. It was such an incredibly shitty and selfish thing to do. I was only focusing on what I wanted in that exact moment and thinking of no one but myself. 

I will never, and although I don't deserve it, I need some advice. People on reddit seem to fall into several different camps. Do I fess up, or would I just be fessing up to assuage my own guilt? A part of me just wants to bury this. I want to bury it and forget it like a bad dream. I want to worship Bob and nurture our relationship and be an amazing partner to him. I wonder whether or not I'd want to know if Bob did something like this... and I think... probably not. However, I also feel like he deserves to know so he can make his own decisions about the situation. I don't want to treat him like an idiot and keep him in the dark. I'm really torn up and scared right now, and I need someone to help me think straight.

I make less than 22K (entry level position, but we were comfortable and had even begun socking back money for savings. Even though we don't go out much, now and again, we could treat ourselves with nights out now and again. We have a nice apartment together and live in safe area. He was able to pay for all his essentials like insurance and gas for his car, pay the power bill and groceries, which he was more than happy to do, even if it meant not having much money for himself. On birthdays he tends to get new work shoes and nice clothes for college

He constantly told me how grateful he was for the opportunity to go to college, but he just smiled and told me it was a small price to pay to be with me and start working on a career.

It's not hyperbole when I say, stupidly in love, more so than I've ever been in my life. We always make time for just cherishing each other's company. We talk about marriage after college and both have promise rings.

A couple weeks ago, admittedly, the professor was being damn demanding of a freshman to sophomore level college class in terms of endless papers and expecting literally 200+ pages of material read each week with no regard for other classes. This class is easily retaken with another professor down the road, and he was about to face midterms in his crucial engineering classes, so I went along with it. He was only taking three other classes since he was working part time.

Yesterday he told me he was failing Chemistry

I went numb. I knew this meant drastic cutbacks on everything

I need help but don't know where to look. I have not spoken to him since last night, terrible feeling I should cut him loose to retain my sanity. I know he really is trying. He studies a lot. But I feel he could be doing better than this, since again, I did it myself once.

I don't want to give up on him, since this would likely be the story for four more years.

**TL;DR My boyfriend is about to quit his part-time job because it is supposedly making him fail college. This will leave us effectively destitute and will impact our quality of life to a degree where I fear I will resent him or worse, but I feel like I have nowhere to turn. What can I do?**

EDIT: I think it is important to mention if he quits college without getting a degree

**RE-EDIT 4/8/2013:** Sorry I've not been more responsive, I really did read them all. I found the one from the Bio teacher especially helpful and encouraging.

Since he'd had about 24 hours to think about the whole situation, and realized it was just not possible to carry on without finanicial support on his end. He said he had hoped to look into getting student loans next year, but would continue his job until he was eligible/the paperwork went through. He insisted that he really did enjoy being at college and his core engineering classes.

I was happy to hear all of the above, and even said back in grade school that he'd been put in a special class for slow readers, but never saw anything come out of it, since they just made him read books endlessly and give him tests on the content, with no real direction on improving his methods or any strategy. (I didn't know about this, but it wasn't so much hiding it from me, moreso I'd never really asked if he'd gotten help for his slow reading. I've always been a very fast reader

He also agreed with me he has to better learn how to budget his time

It wasn't an overly long

Thank you all so very much for all of your suggestions, just like I'd hoped.

**RE-EDIT TL;DR He immediately came forth and admitted he screwed up. He will get help for his studying, will budget his time better, and will continue work until student loan applications get the okay. He definitely wasn't just telling me what I wanted to hear, since I let him speak his peace before I ever gave my opinion. I feel so much better thanks to all of your insight. I felt like I couldn't talk to anyone I knew about it without them automatically telling me there was no hope, and he was just a leech.

But I won't be using THAT lawyer because he said ""how does a college educated woman stay with somebody for 20 years and think this situation is normal?  Couldn't you have looked this stuff up?"".

But now I'm worried that I'll either let them down, really fast because I'm afraid they'll cut me off so I stumble on my words.  Or I stop right in the middle of a conversation because I can't remember a small word that I'm trying to use to get them to understand me.  I hope that the therapist and this lady help me figure out how to fix all this before they throw me out alone in the world.




Well I'm running out of time here and I can't remember everything I wanted to say.  But I wanted to tell everyone that I really do appreciate your help from my last post.

I figured it was hormones and did what I could. I work as an engineer, sometimes later. The 'nesting period' where a mad spurt of cleaning before the birth never happened, she just lay in bed with her laptop. She doesn't want a cleaner because she doesn't want anybody messing with her stuff.


When I met her she was a bit of a loner


It's hard to exaggerate how filthy our home is. I cannot walk in a straight line through the house, clothes, books, magazines and garbage all over the floor. There are pots of rotting and mouldy food in the kitchen. She gets groceries delivered and occasionally I cannot even open our front door because she hasn't put them away.


I try my best to get the place inhabitable when I get home but our son is a light sleeper so there's not much I can do once he's in bed. And when I'm home I obviously spend every moment with him before putting him to bed.


My wife smokes a lot of weed in joints mixed with loose tobacco. I'd say she smokes one long one every two hours or so. She straps our son in to his high chair in front of the TV and goes out the back. I can't convince her to cut down let alone quit. I paid off her dealer to say he was completely out but she found someone else.


Things came to a head last week. I had a really bad chest infection and took a couple of days sick leave. I was hanging out with my son that morning since about 6am. My wife slept on. She rolled out of bed at 10am. I made her a coffee, but took my son onto her lap anyway. As I closed the door I heard her tell my son 'Your dad is a fucking shit'.


I couldn't believe it. I really had enough. I packed some clothes


I told her I couldn't live with her filth


She says it's not good for him to have two homes and that she doesn't trust me. She will only let me visit him for two hours and I'm not allowed to take him out of the house. The poor guy barely gets fresh air. 


A year ago I convinced her to go to a counsellor. Things seemed to be going OK, overly dependent on me and stuck in her 'inner child'. My wife responded by leaving the building and walking 5 miles home. Kinda hit the nail on the head, Mrs. Counsellor. Needless to say my wife believes that the counsellor just didn't like her and was against her from the start.


I know that somewhere inside her is my beautiful


I'm seriously considering quitting my job so I can take custody of my son if I need to. Money is great, but being a good father comes first and I would be happier on welfare knowing my son is happy and not listening to my abusive wife. Thanks guys.

So for now, and I think they're more disappointed about me lying about my sexual activity than anything. My mom was raised a staunch Catholic, though she said she only expected me to wait to have sex until I could ""clean up my own messes"" (read: take care of a baby) but not necessarily be married.  [EDIT/NOTE: A couple people mentioned/asked about what I would do in case of pregnancy. If I were to get pregnant, I would most likely have an abortion. I watch my periods VERY closely (even though I'm on the pill) so I would definitely ""catch"" a pregnancy early enough on to not have too many moral qualms about it. That's my ""plan"", but I know that I'd obviously have more emotions to weigh if put in that situation. Oh and I've also made it a point to always keep enough cash of my own on hand to pay for such a procedure.]

Now, I talked to the family therapist about it, and she said that it's my body and really none of my parents business. I went ahead and scheduled my own appointment at Planned Parenthood to get birth control, which I take every single day at the same time, just like you're supposed to. I've also gotten Gardasil. My boyfriend and I also use condoms to be even more secure. I like to think that I'm being fairly mature/responsible about this. Basically, I'm not a dumbass.

I have a very good relationship with my parents, don't drink or smoke or do drugs at all, that sort of thing. I usually tell my parents everything, except for this. I'm really worried about how this will effect my relationship with them, and I overheard in a phone conversation between my mom and stepdad something like, ""Well, she obviously can't be trusted..."" which is fair, but on the other hand

EDIT: Some details. For those of you concerned about my reliance on my parents financially

EDIT CON'T: Other details. Between my mom/stepdad, three!) siblings that are &lt; 3 years old. I know babies. I know diapers, I know Thomas the Tank Engine, I know baby sign langauge, I know my stuff. I've helped take care of these guys since they started being birthed when I was 14. Hell, I'm 17 (almost 18!) and I have to keep a carseat in my car for toting children around. I know 100% what I'm ""getting into"" with the sex stuff.

**UPDATE:** I spoke to my mom a little bit more via phone, and I told her I was worried about how Boyfriend was feeling (he had to be completely in the dark about everything because I'm not allowed to contact him.) So she sent him [this text](http://i.imgur.com/1tTkddL.jpg) which I thought was really wonderful. I love my mom.

That is all very great, and she's taking care of the baby by herself. The roommate works two jobs, so he really is barely home. When she has free time, she's constantly cleaning up the apartment. She even hand washes all the dishes (including my roommate's) because she doesn't like the dishwasher.

It's really difficult for everyone, but my boyfriend could have at least slept there). The roommate doesn't have parents; he has an aunt and uncle, a brother, and a few friends. I feel like it's important for his wife to be around other women, because she was surrounded by the women of her family in the Philippines every day. The only women the roommate knows are his aunt, his brother's wife, his friend's wife, but I'm around almost every day with my boyfriend

I met the wife yesterday with my boyfriend, she seemed very tired, so we offered to watch the baby while she napped. Unfortunately, we know very little about babies, so we woke her up with a crying baby about a half an hour later. We went out to eat at a little local dinner after the roommate came home, so it was around 9 and no one was there but us. Still, she couldn't order, and ended up crying. It's understandable

This morning she immediately asked my boyfriend where I was, and I know that helps a little.

I guess I'm just wondering: Has anyone here dealt with this kind of issue? How can I make someone feel at home? How can I help out with a six month old baby? Is anyone familiar with Filipino people

Thanks

TLDR; Filipino woman JUST came to America with her infant. She only knows her husband. How do I make her feel welcome?

Edit: I appreciate all the advice everyone has offered here. I had the chance to look through this thread this morning before going over for a bit

The five of us intend on going to some parks and other restaurants very soon. She is very shy, and though I hope her relatives will be able to get it, her relatives go to an internet cafe near their home, so I don't know how useful it might be. A lot of people are also mentioning cooking, which is very helpful and something we can definitely do together. I'm a vegetarian, and she eats very little meat, but she did show me how to make a vegetable lumpia, though I know that there are a lot of informative subreddits and other places online for that. 

A lot of you have been wondering where we are located. We are near Detroit, as we are about a half an hour outside the city, which is further than her husband would want to take her anyway. Some of you have brought up taking her to church, which is a good idea, because she and I are both Catholic, but her husband is atheist and wouldn't really like that.

I think that with a little time she'll open up and be really friendly, but first I'll show her what's nearby on walks. All she knows right now is the apartment, and the grocery store next to the apartment. There's some issues, because her husband thinks that he can get whatever she needs, or go anywhere she needs to go with her, but that's another post I guess, haha.

My wife and I met a long time ago. We went to the same high school and started dating after running into each other in college. She was (and in most respects still is) perfect. She is smart, and come home and have marathon sex. It was great. Hands down the happiest I’ve ever been in my life. If Disney were to make a fairy tale about a guy’s dream, it would be the life we had together.

Lately over the last 5-6 years our life has changed dramatically. We are no longer in college and haven’t been for a while. Life has slowed down. We both have desk jobs

It all started when my wife went through a depression. She and her father were very close, on both counts. She is now back on her feet, and back at work. But she never shed those pounds she gained during the depression. She went from a size 4-6 to a size 18-22+. I’m not exaggerating. I wash her clothes, so I know her dress size. This additional weight is a lot to carry around, both mentally and physically. I know it depresses her. I see it on her face when she looks in the mirror. It bothers me too; somewhere between size 10 and 18 I just quit being attracted to her. It pains me to care about her so much, and then not be able to “get it up”.

Last year
Basically I want my old girlfriend back. I want to get back to having marathon sex. I want to find my wife physically attractive again. I want to be happy, and sex isn’t even a shadow of what it used to be, when we do bother to have it.

I want my wife back. I know she is in there somewhere. She still sends me flirty texts. She still grins that devilish grin that speaks volumes of what she wants to do to me. But once we are alone that all falls apart. She doesn’t sleep naked. And neither of us is motivated to have sex. On the off chance we do, but this problem has been around for years, and I’m looking for some solution.

For my wife’s new  job requires her to travel on occasion. Recently she was out of town for three weeks on business.  She was able to return for the weekend

Things seemed ok. Except for on the second week she was away one night she wouldn’t answer my calls

Yeah, long while and it was so, so very out of character for her to do this. I made a mistake I’ll never make again. I trusted her instead of trusting myself. Anyways she came home that weekend and things were ok. I rapidly shuffled my suspicion to the back of my mind and went on with life. Things seemed ok. 

Fast forward to the weekend she returned for good after spending three weeks away. I was helping her unpack and found a package for the morning after pill in her bag. Being a married couple and not being aware of her having some need for the pill it was immediately pretty obvious. I was sitting in our bedroom and the sensation of the walls closing in around me was one of the worst I have ever experienced. I think I briefly blacked out for a second. I went ahead and confronted her and after a few seconds of shocked horror she confessed.  She had met a man over the internet for the purpose of sex and had proceeded to fuck him. Three times over the course of her first two weeks out of town. That was the second worst day of my life.

There was a lot of anger on my part

 I dropped her off at her folks, but that things had been bad for a while and she felt alone, distant, etc etc. It was a long talk and many more subjects than that came up, but that was the jest of the why. Other details also came up as well. I don’t know why I wanted to know them but I asked and she constantly was resistant to answer. 
Eventually we reached the point where I did feel at least we had a frank discussion about our relationship and what she had done. I still loved my wife then (much like I still do now), but we talked, we went out to eat and I thought we were on track to fix things.

Then she left her e-mail account logged in before going to work. I know it was a violation of her privacy to start digging, possibly the only time my hands stopped shaking and I almost had a chuckle), but she had invited him back again. He had declined.

I called her. And I asked who he was and told her to come home ASAP. She came back from work and once again I confronted her. And yes

There was. A third man she had sex with on the third week.

I can see no way on Earth to salvage this. I do still love my wife and I view the whole three weeks as just one big cluster fuck of bad decisions on her part. If she had just come clean with me in the first place I might have actually been able to put it behind us. Things were actually going well after we first made our peace and started trying to move forward. I had hope we might be able to pull through. Now this though. More lies.

/r/relationships I know what I have to do

We moved here for her new job and I am now 600 miles from my family and friends. I don’t actually feel trapped buying a plane ticket and flying back would not be an issue

Anyone have any advice? I think it’s pretty clear at this point there is no salvaging this no matter how much I would like to. How effective is couple’s counseling? I’ve researched a bit because I really need to keep busy right now and results seem to vary very wildly. I feel crushed and like I only have one option that I find distasteful.

1338247301.0,u9faf,GF stopped taking birth control pills without telling me?,taway888,186,31,173,"**Original Post:**

My girlfriend (28f) of 6 months mentioned that she thought her period was coming because she felt tired. I (24m) was confused by this because the timing was wrong. 

After some probing she said that she hadn't taken any pills for ""a couple of weeks."" During that time we have had unprotected sex multiple times. I feel that unilaterally stopping birth control without talking to the other person is a gross violation of trust.

She said it wasn't a problem and wasn't my business because 

1) She can't get pregnant since she hasn't had her period for three months (the internet indicates this is untrue); and 

2) She stopped so as to get her period because she was uncomfortable without it. This is a matter of her health which is her discretion.

Given she has full health insurance and I told her to see a doctor the last time she missed her period

I'm sort of shocked that she would unilaterally decide to stop taking birth control pills. I feel like this is a large violation of my trust. 

I'm not particularly worried about her being pregnant or trying to get pregnant (although I suppose there is a small possibility of either)

**tldr:** GF (28f) of 6 months stopped taking birth control for health reasons without telling me. She says this is fine and a non-issue because she has not had a period in 3 months so cannot get pregnant. I disagree strongly.

**EDIT1:** GF has stated she doesn't want to have kids and (by my evaluation) is not in a good position to have kids.

**Edit2: Thanks everyone for the advice and supportive comments!**

**Update: 5/28**

Talked to her again. She seems pretty guilty and has admitted she is in the wrong. She has reiterated that pregnancy is not an option for her.

Her explanation: She was really busy and didn't have time to see the doctor for a follow up appointment and renew her prescription. She didn't tell me before sex because 

1. she (incorrectly) thought she couldn't get pregnant

2. she (correctly) thought I would be pissed off at her laziness and poor time management if she told me

3. she wanted to have sex.

This explanation is extremely believable to me. Her previous statements still don't really make sense

She's in the dog house for now but I things are likely going to be fine.

**tldrupdate:** She didn't tell me because she didn't think she could get pregnant and is slightly incompetent. I believe this. She is very sorry and won't do it again.

**Update2: 5/29**

Considering pushing GF to get a Depo-Provera shot (since hasn't behaved responsibly in taking pills). I suspect she will be unhappy with that suggestion but will agree. Does that sound reasonable?

So, but he's convinced we could make it work. For the record, he isn't working right now. He's living with his mother right now, who is also not working and they just received a foreclosure notice on their home. He's been trying to get work, but hasn't come across anything yet. So, how he thinks we can raise it is beyond me. He just keeps saying, ""We can make this work. Give me time."" 

I've already accepted that it's not possible. Both our lives, but there's just not a lot I can see done. But I don't want to completely disrespect his views by going to get an abortion anyway. Is there any advice you guys could give me to convince him I just can't have this child? 

EDIT: A lot of you seem to be very supportive of it being my decision. I appreciate that. But I need advice for how to help him cope with it. I'm pretty sure I can't convince him I'm doing the right thing



EDIT: [IMPORTANT] I talked with him after reading this thread. We discussed adoption for awhile. We decided that in the end, its just another option that neither of us thought practical. I couldn't risk losing my scholarships or breaking from my job. He wouldn't get to be a dad. I made it clear to him that by making the decision to have the child, he would be putting the health and well-being of the girl he claimed to love in jeopardy. This got his attention. I explained how I would suffer in the long run. Explained how it could ruin his life as well. We'd be putting a lot of pressure on his family, since my family couldn't be involved. I asked him if wanted to raise a child with the best possible future or raise one who'd be struggling everyday. I reassured him that we could have children in the future. He said he was under the impression that abortions could cause women to have difficulty having kids later. I said the earlier I get it done, the less chance of that. 

He left to go for a walk after we talked. When he came he agreed the abortion was the best choice

The kiss lasted for about 10 seconds before I pulled away.  She blinked several times, obviously stunned, before she asked ""what was that for"".


While she was finishing cooking, how amazing her personality is.  She just listened and blushed, sometimes downplaying herself to which I'd reiterate my point.  After we finished dinner and I rinsed the dishes, we sat down for some TV and a movie, when she snuggled in and turned me towards her and kissed me back!  Not long, but just a return of the favor, which let me know she was OK with the fact that I had kissed her.


Sadly, nor sexytime (which I believe it's that time of the month), which is OK.  We've still got our date tonight, and I'm sure there will be more time while out and once we return to continue to get intimate.

I totally forgot I posted my story to r/relationships awhile back. Figured I would update one last time.

The past two months have been turbulent. My girlfriend wanted to press charges but has been reluctant to do so. She said that he'll get better, but it's what she wanted to do. 

On top of this, not being as cuddling when we do hang out, and even deleted her facebook. I figured this was all due to stress from finals and finding a job. After telling her time after time if she needs to destress that I'm there for her, I finally confonted her about her emotional distance about three weeks ago. She told me the following:

1. She will not press charges against her friend.
2. She thinks that it's best we split. 
3. She mentioned that she's going to start dating her friend
4. If I mention any of what happened in the past few months to anyone

Most of the following is verbatim...I know because I keep replaying everything in my mind.

A...lot has happened in the past couple days.  We talked Friday night...many tears were shed.  Saturday, and both of us felt great.

Yesterday she came home and we talked again, her face fell.  

""I don't want to sound douchey...""  

""Don't worry about that

""...I don't love you.""

*long pause*

I'm in a bit of shock, or end it now before we were incapable of being amicable.  I sit there and she says, ""But that's not necessary...I care about you.  You're a great person, and a wonderful father, and no matter what we can stay together.  People stay in loveless marriages all the time.""

""So...this past weekend

""I...I decided it didn't matter so much to me if we're otherwise happy

Another long pause.

""We can still do this

""I...don't know if **I** can, it had changed but we still did love each other, and we could work on it.  This...this changes things.  For me.  I said years ago, I wouldn't stay in a loveless marriage...when did this happen?""

""A couple weeks ago, ""Maybe a couple months.""

""...any reason I didn't have the right to know about it before now?""

""You said you wouldn't get mad so long as I was honest.""

""I'm not mad.  Somewhere inside I'm ecstatic that you told me.  Just, ""I kind of wish you had told me this earlier.  Before we spent the weekend trying to figure out where we were.""

""My parents don't love each other.""

""Your parents are miserable

""We have kids

""That's not a good reason to stay married if we're at this place...that's actually a horrible reason to stay married.  Can you love me?""

""I don't know.  We can try.  People do it all the time.""

""I...need to go to for a walk.""

So

""You're leaving?""  She asked

""I don't think I can stay...""

""The kids?""

""We'll figure it out...I want this to be amicable.  I don't want a fight.  We'll divide things as best we can...Lord knows we don't have much that isn't already protected on both sides.  I'd like the house down south where my family is...we'll figure out a trade for your half of it.  It'll destroy the kids if we do this the wrong way, I will scorch the goddamn Earth under your feet.  Anything else we can come to a compromise on, but if you or your family try to dick me around about my kids, I will rain Hell over this county and use every resource I have to destroy all of you and everything you hold dear.  I will never try to screw you with them...you're a wonderful mother...but I will not put up with any shenanigans where my kids are involved.""

""Understandable...I'd never do that

""You wouldn't

""I won't let them.""

""You sure haven't stopped them from doing anything else...""

""I'm sorry.""

""No

She's quiet.  I'm quiet.

""Can you sleep on it?""  she asked.

""I don't know if it'll change anything...""

""Please?""  

So I did.  We slept in the same bed, the kids between us watching a movie.  This morning the alarm went off, and I got up and took a deep breath...then woke her.

""Yes?"" she said.

""...I'm going back down south.  I'd like to take the kids with me.  We'll be at my parents' house.  They need to know

""...You're leaving?""

""...I guess so.""

""Your job...""

""...can go to hell.  I can't lose you and then stay up here.  It'll kill me.  I need my family if I'm going to make it through this.""

We packed the kids.  I loaded the car.  The kids were still sleeping when she left for work this morning

""I don't want you to go

""I really don't want to go

*silence*

""Would you like me to wait until you get home tonight?"" I asked.

""Will it make it harder?""

""It'll give me time to think without you here.""

""...okay.""

She picked up her wedding ring and put it in her pocket.  I left mine

Before she went into her office

""I can't do this.  I have to know.  I won't be able to do my job if I don't know

""I...can't give you an answer.  You've had more time to think about this than I have.""

""No I haven't...""

I'm the original OP but didn't remember my login for the old throwaway.

I am very sad to be here making an update on this post due to the fact that my mother has decided to end her own life. I am going through many different emotions right now

I'm very upset that she put my grandparents through this. It was apparently a rather bloody suicide. She cut her wrists

I was incredibly shocked at this news because she has never attempted previously (beyond her binges that I've always considered suicidal). She had apparently been speaking openly about the possibility for several months

I feel a lot of regret right now because I didn't want this for her and I hurt because I wish I could have been there for her. I feel some guilt (I know

Her brother-my uncle (who got in contact with me) said that she was on probation for a DUI (I think her third) in a double hit and run (which made the papers in my city) and was required to do breathalyzer tests at home multiple times per day and had (obviously) broken that so was looking at the crappy end of a tunnel leading her to jail. 

My mother was a very egotistical woman. She was a master manipulator. She was successful at leading me to doubtful thoughts about my own sanity for many years - that *I* was selfish for not forgiving her and for all the horrible things I said to her when she was drinking. But my mother was a very tragic woman. When she was sober

How does a person with this much pent up anger and sadness act at a funeral for their mother? How does the only child of this person stand in the spotlight and grieve while other people wonder why I have the anger and regret and more anger that exists inside? 

Her first hospitalization was February of 1987

Thanks for listening. Hopefully I can start to rebuild my relationship with my grandparents.

A lot of people involved so I'll try to keep it as simple as possible. 

My wife and I have been together for 5 years and married for 3 1/2 years. I am 28/m and she is 30/f. We have no children together, but he is harmless. I just feel kind of sad for him, and I don't worry about him too much but he is part of our life. 

Initially, my opinion sort of changed. I didn't care enough at the time to forbid it, and my thinking was I would cause issues by telling her what she can and can't do. 

But I started to act more and more single and put myself out there. Our initial agreement was total upfront honesty, and out of those ONS I met a girl who I started to have feelings for. That girl, Abby is 26/f and she was my respite from my wife and the madness at home. We saw each other casually for the first month or so, and I dodged around the house set-up and open marriage, but eventually came clean. We took a break when I told her I was married, but eventually she took me back. 

She took me back around New Years and we've been seeing each other a lot and she is kind of forcing my hand. She wants me out of my house and a divorce filed soon, or is it better to cut my losses.

My boyfriend finally got home tonight from his weekend stay at his parents and things did not go as well as I had hoped.  

I'll start off by admitting that I've been an emotional wreck since yesterday and that probably didn't help matters.  I thought it would have been better to wait until he got home to talk things through but I think that just made things worse because I spent all night last night being pissed off.

He got home, he says to me, ""So I hear you had a rough night?""  That's when he goes on to tell me that my lying bitch of a ""best friend"" CALLED HIM after our fight and told him that I basically attacked her.  She called him at midnight and pretty much cried to him for over an hour!  He said she was ""scared"" that I was going to make him stop seeing her.  He told me she admitted her feelings to him during their conversation also.

My boyfriend said he was caught off guard about the whole thing and didn't realize she had feelings for him.  (I don't know if I necessarily believe that).  So now I'm the one that looks like the bitch.  He says he's on my side but he's not acting like it.  We had a heated argument for over an hour (mostly me yelling and crying).  He says he just wants everyone to just move on from the fight but I can't!  

He's tired from his trip and didn't want to fight so he said we could talk about it tomorrow.  He didn't even want to stay the night.. he left and went to his apartment without even giving me a kiss or hug good-bye.  I can't help but feel like he's taking her side even though he says he's not.  I don't even know what to say.  What a shitty weekend this has been.

[Update: going through counseling...](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ww13m/my_wife_of_9_years_is_considering_leaving_me/)

My wife came clean about what was on her mind. She didn't bring up anything brand new

She told me she hasn't felt in love with me or felt attracted to me in any way in a long time. I said ""how long?"" and she said ""long"".

I asked ""were you ever in love with me?"" and she said ""I don't know"".

I asked her about the time we spoke on the phone (we met online

I asked her about when we met in person when I flew to Canada. That was always our best time. We had a blast and had great sex and loved each other greatly

She said it felt exciting and she was attracted to me and had fun

She said she wasn't completely turned on by my body type. I'm a lanky

I've brought up my own insecurities about this fact before

I told her I was puzzled because she initiated contact with me after seeing my photograph and being attracted to me. She said she was attracted to me

I sent multiple pictures and always conveyed that I was a tall

I asked her if she was turned off when she met me in person and she said that she wasn't. We had sex almost instantly and many

She was 17 at the time and I told her I understand and I don't think she was intentionally trying to use me even though it may have worked out that way.

She said she cannot enjoy sex with me. I asked her ""for how long"" she says ""a long time"". I asked her if she ever enjoyed sex. She says that over half of her orgasms have been fake

I asked her why she didn't say something sooner. I said I wish we could have worked on things together but she said she didn't know how to say it and she thought there was something wrong with her for having these feelings.

She brought up multiple habits of mine that she finds highly unattractive and repulses her sexually. She said I cross my legs European style and she hates it. She's told me before

She said sometimes the way I talk or motion with my hands or facial expressions seem feminine or awkward to her

We married in a whirlwind 6 months after she met me, and to her credit she did, too.

I see how much burden she has carried and despite my own feelings I actually feel sorry for her. I asked her why she didn't leave. She said she didn't want to be a 19 year old divorced woman.

Then she didn't want to be a 20 year old divorced woman...

Then she didn't want to be a 21 year old divorced woman...

It slowly became easier to stay than go home

She said she told her grandparents that she wanted to stay home one time when she was visiting (meaning not go back to the states with me). Her grandmother told her to follow her heart. Her grandfather told her she made her bed and she should lie in it (he is a traditionalist when it comes to marriage).

Her grandfather passed away shortly thereafter.

9 months later we had our first child

She said a woman asked her recently how her marriage was and she said ""fine"" and the woman replied ""just fine?"" and it made my wife realize her true feelings she was repressing.

She said a friend of hers recently spoke about relationships and asked my wife ""you're in love with him though, I said *in love*"" and my wife said ""umm..."" and the friend said ""you don't know if you're *in* love? silly!"" and that was the end of it but it made my wife realize she needed to have this talk with me.

This hit me out of nowhere

I told her I felt sorry for her

She was crying

I always used to read funny jokes about how married couples don't have sex and it made me feel better. I tried to feel like it was okay that my wife never expressed passion towards me. Now I know it wasn't my fault.

I told her that I wished she said this right from the start. I asked her why we planned to have our second child. She said it seemed like the thing she should do. She said it seemed like she should be happy with her life and she should want to buy a house and a big car and have a sibling for our first-born to play with and that's what someone in her situation should want to do.

I asked her why she wanted to go out to see a movie with me last night knowing what she felt inside. She confirmed my suspicions that she was just trying to do a friendly gesture and that it might be fun but didn't change her feelings

She said I was the nicest guy she ever met and wasn't sure she'd ever meet someone as truly nice as me who loved her as much as I did. I told her she could find any guy

She said she was afraid I would try and take the children away from her and I told her of course not.

She asked if we could be friends and I said that honestly no

It felt like things were finally over after our talk. In a strange way it felt like a relief. Still

She seemed to indicate she would be willing to do another counseling session even after all that came out. She said she felt like she needed counseling of her own

I asked her if she felt that now that everything was on the table

I asked her if she was just saying that to make me feel better

I said ""that means no doesn't it?"" and she said ""I honestly don't know. That's why I need space"". I told her that I needed closure and she said she knew

I know everyone is going to jump on me here for saying all that. The truth is that I still feel that deep down we had something at one point and it wasn't just based on me being a well-adjusted guy or nice or caring or whatever. We had sex like rabbits at one point. I felt passion from her towards me.

Part of me wants to think that maybe with this out that part of her still exists

I told her I was not okay staying in a holding pattern while she went out and experimented with other guys. She said she had no intentions and wasn't speaking with anyone

I asked her point blank what she would do if someone asked her out and she said she would probably feel excited and she feels like she really needs passion in her life after not having it for so long.

She said something along the lines of ""I want passion and if it's not with you then I still need passion"".

I am trying to think logically but inside I keep grasping for signs that she still has a spark inside for me that might come out after some distance.

Maybe she'd go on a few dates or fool around and realize she does have passion for me but it was impossible to express with so many things gone unsaid for so long? Maybe she would find me attractive if I did not seem so depressed due to her not wanting me. If I felt more confident or seemed like I was moving on.

But I can't accept that I need to let her ""screw around"" and then come crawling back. I told her as much. I said if she intends on seeing anyone that she needs to tell me now so we can consider this over and I can move on and she said ""I don't know"".

She later said ""don't worry I doubt anyone would ask me on a date"" and I said that didn't make me feel better and it wasn't what I was asking her and she said she understood but just needed time and space.

I asked her again this morning if she could give me the closure I need

I asked her if we could at least agree that we weren't ""on the market"" right now while we sort this out

I am so fucked in the head right now. I am reading all of your previous advice. I am going to try and do the ""180"". I am going to read up on books like ""The married man sex life"". I am going to try and be strong for my kids and hang out with friends and move on.

Last talk before we agreed to take a ""time out"" was that she feels sure she should ""move on"". I asked her if she was 100% she would not change her mind as we proceed down this path and she said ""no"".

I know that not too many people responded to my original post

My boyfriend and his ""friend"" haven't hung out since my previous post (3 months ago). That is

I snooped. I know I shouldn't have. I know I should have just asked him. The thing is
This is what I found on his phone:

There was a short conversation about making plans a couple of Saturdays ago. It didn't end up happening because of a family issue

Him: ""If you're okay with it

Her: ""I think you're right. Do you happen to be free on Wednesday? If so let's not go to [bar]."" 

Him: ""I work until five. Do you want to do supper or something?"" 

Her: ""I'll be at work until 6:30. I'll just text you after and we can figure it out."" Him: ""Supper you think or just some drinks? Or whatever you are thinking

Her: ""If you want to do drinks that's fine. I usually try to eat something quick/healthy at home during the week. I'll leave it up to you"" 

Him: ""That's cool with me. Text me when you're off and tell me when and where."" 

Her: ""Will do."" 

Him: ""And one more thing

Her: ""Thanks :) you too""


Later ---


Her:""I'm just about to leave work. What were you thinking for tonight?"" 

Him: ""I'm okay with anything. Even if you just want to hang at your place too I'm seriously okay with that as well. Whatever you think."" 

Her: ""Are you opposed to [bar]? If it's lame we can do whatever. Maybe you can meet [her cat] lol""


Later


Her: ""Hey

Him: ""Yes ma'am. And yeah I had a really good time.. catching up and all.""


I know there's nothing glaringly awful in there. This is the first time they've hung out in three months and I just feel there's something off about it. Another issue is that I'll be leaving in May for four months back to my hometown. It's 2 1/2 hours away. These are the same conditions in which the original concerning incidents occurred - when I was gone for Christmas break.


Am I crazy? Be honest. In fact

I said that I thought it was inappropriate for him to be spending time with her and asked him why he felt the need to see her. He wasn't mad. He just got really quiet.

I'd really appreciate it you'd take a few moments to read my whole post.

Hello Internet

This coming Monday I have to see my ex boyfriend in a UK civil small claims court. We split up 2 years ago (he cheated on me). I was very ill with depression at time and practically had a complete meltdown when the relationship ended. 

We lived together, take his belongings or vehicle and didn't pay me a penny for his share of the rent for the 4 months remainder of the lease. This house was taken on based on both our income. Prior to this move he didn't have a job and I covered much of the bills and he racked up a lot of credit card debt.

When we moved he chose to get into even more debt. When he left the house (pathetically I wanted him to stay, threatening to come back into the house and take my belongings while I worked. I had no one I could turn to. For the sake of a quiet life, I signed in the end. By this stage I was living with a friend feeling really vulnerable and being eaten alive with debt and anxiety. I just wanted him to go away. It seemed like the easy option by this point.

I stopped paying the monthly payments a year ago. It’s taken a further year for this to come to court. He made the application but he has not stuck to the court time table.

As evidence, but it’s partial email transcripts. In my bleakest days, I deleted every trace of him out of my life. The case is ambiguous and contradictory but the fact remains, I signed the agreement. I cannot afford legal advice so I have no idea how this will go down really. I have tried to be as factual and chronological as I can and he has gone for the mud-slinging approach.

If I lose I will get financially black listed for 6 years. But worse than that

This could go either way

First Update:  http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/154vzb/i_29m_have_separated_from_my_gf_22f_and_it_was_a/

First, and reading other posts really made me feel like I wasn't so alone in the world.  So, thank you.

Alright, and it was a lonely time.  I had anger in me.  Lots of it, I would see couples, and I would instantly hate them.  My self-worth was incredibly low, and I failed at eating right and exercising, and I was so stressed and worked up, just eating made me nauseous and was difficult to keep food down sometimes.  I lost a lot of weight, because I am already a pretty skinny guy.

I did a lot of soul searching, and I had ups and downs, but I spent a lot of time with friends.  Not being alone is great, and having friends listen to you just say the same things over and over again is great.  

Suddenly, and a minor in music.  I wrote a book two years ago, and used to play drums in a couple bands.  I realized I no longer have any drive in life.  I stopped writing, stopped playing music, stopped being this happy go lucky, magnetic and charming person I used to be.  I was just coasting through life, and that was how I treated our relationship.  No, any healthy relationship needs me to be happy with myself.  That was something I needed to change.  That was December 29th.

I got off my ass, put on a suit, and went to the bar with some friends.  There is a lot to be said, and even slightly therapeutic about knowing you look great.  I wasn't out to troll for drunk girls.  Just, decided I would actually be social, meet new people, and have fun with my friends.  It was great.  I started feeling my self-worth again, and that I have a lot of value.

New Years eve rolled around, and I stayed up until 5:30 in the morning with these girls.  Just me and five ladies.  I did not sleep with any of them.  I informed them of my situation and said I am just really happy to be talking to some new people.  We exchanged numbers, and I now have a great group of girls that I spend time with.  Yes, I am aware that one or two of them are attracted to me.  But, I don't want to rush things, and I am completely honest with them of my feelings.

They invited me to a dinner they do on New Years every year

I constantly am trying new bars and restaurants, meeting new people almost every day, and I feel pretty good.  Yes, sometimes it still hurts, but I am realizing that I deserve someone who appreciates me, and will contribute to my life as much as I'll contribute to theirs.  My ex, she is not the girl for me.  I thought she was.  But, because I will be better.

I started writing and playing music again.  Actually

Sorry it is long
""Hope ur glad

My response was: ""I am sorry.  I don't understand how it is my fault though.""

I let it go for about 30 minutes, but necessary.  Here goes:

""Actually, but I am certain that day will be too late.  I thought that you were the one for me, but you aren't.  There's other ones.  I treated you better than anyone has and probably better than anyone will and you just throw it away like it doesn't matter.  Good luck with this new guy.  I am done with this""

I felt so freaking liberated.  My life will improve.  I will be for the better, spend time with friends, stop putting your ex on a pedestal, you broke up for a reason, even if it wasn't your reason.  There IS something better for us out there, don't waste time on people that won't waste time on you.  

I know I am not 100% fixed, and I have been happiest in past couple days then I have in the past six weeks.  Thank you everyone.

TL;DR - Decided to move on

EDIT: I need to clarify- When  I said he is a photographer

Hi Reddit. Before you start calling me a psycho

First- Relationship: a little over 8 years. I'm F 27

Question: What do I do about my boyfriend's friendship with a woman with whom I believe inappropriate things have happened?

I've had a persistent, but ran into each other at college (my boyfriend and I were in a relationship at that time). When I initially met her, she seemed reserved but pleasant. Over the years, however, I have noticed that a level of hostility from her has arisen. It started with her avoiding me while at social gatherings and gradually escalated into general passive aggression and an almost frigid attitude (after reconnecting with my boyfriend, she was introduced to our friends and weaseled her way in to our group, so I have to see her quite frequently). While I liked her well enough at first, no goodbye. Nothing. (she also brought a guest with her to the restaurant- I didn't know she was coming nor did I know who she was). A small time later, but he’s either incredibly daft or he doesn't want to admit to me that her behavior is that of someone with a crush. I firmly believe it’s the latter... Since they reconnected at college

For a long time, my boyfriend would leave the room. They would talk for a very long time- sometimes hours (he barely allots me 3 minutes when we talk on the phone). They would send texts to each other late at night (sometimes I would ask who he was talking to, and he would tell me it was nobody, but I looked over his shoulder one night and saw it was her). At first, I had foolishly hoped he was telling me this because he didn't want me to get any ideas about them, but I quickly realized that was incredibly stupid of me. Why would he lie? What was he hiding? Finally, I’d had enough. We have had several disagreements about this woman and how I feel about her and how I believe she feels about him. Obviously talking about it wasn't helping... I went into my boyfriend’s email and searched her name. Two emails from her popped up. One of them was very upsetting. The email said the following (paraphrased from her to him):
“I crossed the line tonight… I shouldn't have tried to kiss you… You are just so easy to be around and I feel so comfortable with you… But you are right- we need boundaries… If I ever try to do that again
His response (paraphrased)
“It’s okay [yada, the happy faces were in their emails.

Needless to say, but that just doesn't seem to matter to me. After reading that, I looked into his Facebook. I found messages between them from 2010 that consisted of her asking how much he charges for photographs (he’s a photographer) because she wanted him to take some “experimental” photographs of her so that she could see herself “the way [he sees her]”. He responded that he wouldn't charge anything and that if she meant nudes, then he would have to install Photoshop on her computer and edit them at her house “for obvious reasons:)” (clearly indicating I was one of those reasons). She responded that they would talk when she got back (I don’t know from where). There wasn't anything after that, so I don’t know if the pictures were ever taken, but I have a sinking feeling that they were…

I also checked his text messages. There weren't any from her. But I know they were texting the night before

I know I shouldn't have gone into his personal stuff. I know it was wrong and childish and rather crazy. In my defense, etc. He told me that nothing had happened since. He said that he didn't tell me because he knew I would freak out about it and he didn't want to lose her as a friend because he “cares” about her. Then he turned the discussion into how I was the bad guy for looking at his private stuff. I almost left the house that night. Instead, we ended up sleeping in separate beds. I did not tell him about the stuff I saw on his Facebook- he was so mad after I told him about the email, I didn't want to tell him more.

The next morning, though, that if the tables were turned, would he want me to still hang out with that person- I reminded him that he asked me in the past to stop hanging out with a male friend with whom I attended primary school because he felt that there were feelings between the two of us; while I can say that there was a time when I did have feelings for this man- in primary school- nothing ever happened between us and we became good friends instead. I ended this friendship for my boyfriend because he told me he felt uncomfortable with it.

So, he doesn't know about the Facebook thing and I can’t tell him about it now. He asked me to promise never to “invade his privacy” again and I really don’t want to get into another argument... But I can’t get this out of my head. I think it’s the nudes that are really getting to me. I mean, if her trying to kiss him gives him a hard on, what would taking nude photos do? What else has happened? 

…There is so much more to this story, that in the past, I was the one creating problems. I never cheated on him- though he thinks I did (very, very long story- think Ross and Rachel and their “break)”… there are many ways to create problems in a relationship and I have probably done the majority of them. I am not an innocent in this or anything of the like. But I would really appreciate some advice…

tl;dr: I've already confronted him

1348855033.0,10mnpj,I'm a married man that had a 4 year affair. There was a child and b/c of some legal issues I now have custody of her. How can my wife and I integrate her into our family and explain this to our kids and friends/family? ,InfinitEGY,285,132,399,"I am **45/MALE**. I have been married for **20 YEARS**. 

My wife is **42/FEMALE**. Our children are **17

My affair lasted from **March 2007 to May 2011**

My daughter is **10 months old** 

My affair partner is **23/FEMALE**

**TL:DR** I had an affair for 4+ years. The affair resulted in a daughter who is now under my legal custody. My wife and I are reconciling and we want to raise my daughter as our own. I am unsure of how to explain this situation to people who are naturally going to be curious as to why we have another child without giving TMI or embarrassing myself and my family. I am looking for advice on how to proceed. 

I'll try to keep things simple. I had an on again off again affair with a troubled young woman. It was wrong, etc. The affair is over and has been for over a year now. I have apologized to my wife and we are working on healing our marriage. 

At the tail end of our affair the affair person ended up becoming pregnant. There was some dispute as to whether I was the father and the timing was a little too convenient. Daughter was born in December 2011. Paternity was confirmed in the Spring of 2012. I've been spending several hours a week with my baby since then and paying child support. Within the last few weeks my former affair partner has been going through some legal issues that are likely to jeopardize her custody. In July she was arrested on cocaine possession and around the same time ended up with a DWI. I began to become concerned with the health and safety of my daughter and the affair partner agreed to turn over custody of our daughter to me. Currently we are ironing out the legal matters with our lawyer but it should be done soon. My former affair partner is going to have to serve a 30 days sentence sometime this year (she probably won't serve all 30 days but she will be in jail for some period of time). We will have the transfer done before then. I won't be getting child support from her which I suppose is fine

I have my wife's support in bringing my daughter into our lives. What we are unsure of is how to explain our daughter to our friends and family. My wife does not want anyone to know about the affair and we have not told anyone about it. I agree with her decision. I don't want my teenage children to think worse of me because of the affair. I do not want my wife to be humiliated because of the affair. 

That leaves us with basically the option of telling people that we are adopting my daughter and that she is unrelated to me. I am not sure if this level of deceit is the best way to go about this. I don't know what other choices we have. I am curious to know if this forum has any other advice on how to proceed. What other options are there for this? 

**9 PM EDIT/UPDATE**

Want to clarify a couple points. This is more of a ""cover story"" for extended family and friends. With my daughter there won't be any deception. When she is old enough I will explain things. She will know that I am her daddy and I love her and that she is mine.

I also realize there are people that deserve the truth. My wife. Alexa (my baby daughter). My kids. And then there are people who don't deserve the truth like extended family. So it may end up there are two stories. The truth for my family and the cover story for others. I do not look forward to confessing to my children but it will have to happen at some point. I accept that. 

Wanting to explain away this is more my wife's idea than my own. She needs to be able to hold her head up high and I want to respect her wishes. She could have left and didn't. I am grateful for that and I feel that I owe her this. 

The explanations that I've thought of and that have been offered are 

- Adoption - Seems like the best choice at this point

- Surrogate - It is an acceptable option except there is a 10 month absence that is going to be difficult to explain

- Total Honesty - Perhaps the easiest story but one that will cause my wife and me shame and humiliation 

- Sperm Donation Gone Awry - This has been thrown about a few times and I suppose it works. It does seem kind of unheard of and complicated. We'll see. I think this is too contrived to work. 

I appreciate all the advice. Lots to think about. I will go over some of these options with the wife. We are going to get Alexa from my affair partner early next week and I would like to figure something out before then. I will try to post an update to this post in a couple weeks.

I fear that I will lose my family or *her* family more like.

Pretty sure this was all my fault


First off

Kop and I are on the same swim team, since we don't get to hang out that often (he's a grade higher, and we go to different school districts). 


We exchange texts, and one day we asked me a question asking about my love life. He said he was looking for someone, and I said I was just heading into the realm of dating, and don't want to dive head first. I actually don't want to start dating until the middle of high school if I had time.


Kop was being more intimate in his daily hugs, I was still clueless. All of his questions were asked in text, and he never confronted me about them in person. 


The texting went a little like this:


K: Hey StopTextingMeDude


S: I dunno


K: Would you be interested in me? 


S: Why?


K: I would like to date you.


**PEWWWW! Mind blow what-am-I-supposed-to-do-now?!**


I am extremely under experienced  in the dating region of society


I told him in person the next day I wasn't interested in him, when I am ready I could date him. He didn't respond like he would in text, he was shy and snappy in his answers. He texted me again that day about why I wouldn't date him, and told him that I wasn't ready, I considered him a friend, and it wouldn't work since we can't hang out much as kids in school.


I told Kop that we should wait and see what happens in the future


- Hanging out

- Making out often (he knows I have never dated before)

- Abandoning my close friends for him 

- And lying to my parents to be with him


I told him I wasn't interested in doing those


Texted me the next day with ""new"" plans


I told him my ideas if we dated
 rules. He completely tossed away my ideas


At this point it was I only a month after my confrontation with Kop


Few days later I met him again after practice and sat him down for a talk. I told him about how he was ignoring my suggestions and just pulling out his own


His texts that night blew up. All caps: ""WHY DON'T YOU LIKE ME. AM I NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU? IF YOU DIDN'T LIKE ME THEN WHY DID YOU LEAD ME ON?""


I didn't know how I answer


I didn't speak or text him after that


Kop's texts are something like this:


""Think about the future


""There will be no one who will understand you more than me""


""You're making a mistake by not kissing me""



I don't know if I actually lead him on

He doesn't enjoy holding hands, in which I get rejected about half of the time. It hurts to be rejected.. but if I don't ask for sex I don't think we'd be having it. 


And I LOVE making out, but I still feel like I'm worth trying for.. All of these things are really taking a toll on me, and making me feel extremely insecure. I've told him about this stuff quite a few times and each time he tells me he will try but I honestly don't think he is trying as hard as he could be. We had this conversation a week ago and since then I haven't initiated sex and so we haven't had sex. I get that I'm far more sexual than him, but he says sex doesn't really matter to him. It used to, we used to have sex all the time and even though he didn't do those things I enjoy, I felt wanted then. I don't want to push him to do things he doesn't want to, especially since I have PTSD from being sexually abused by my father when I was 5 so I would never wanna make him feel like he has to do anything he doesn't want to.


He is a gamer, but the fact that he always wants to play and not do much else really makes me resent video games. I also don't enjoy going to bed alone more than half of my nights. But he's been working on that and coming to bed with me more which has been nice to see some baby steps. It's things like that, that make me believe he wants to change and maybe it will take longer than I think.. 


Don't get me wrong, and his lover too. I don't want this post to be full of negativity, because that only shows one part of our relationship when there is way more to it than all of this. A lot of this is just stuff stuck inside my head that needs to come out and be rationalized with help from other people. We have an amazing connection, and can always make each other laugh til our tummy aches. I wouldn't want to trade that for anything, and I'd rather struggle with him for a while than go out and try to find anyone else. He cares about me and always makes sure that I'm okay, and I don't doubt his love for me because I know it's there and always has been. 


How can I talk to him about this in a way that shows him I'm willing to help him change, and I can see it in his eyes when he looks at me. But I need to feel wanted, I need to physically feel like more than just his best friend. This is a man I want a future with, and I'm willing to work out the differences we have to make it. I just don't know how or where to start.

Him: [m32]
Relationship duration: 6 months.

First, because all his asking has made me less interested in having it at all, and of course anal sex itself is not the most pleasant of experiences. I have explained this to him.  He still continues to bring it up, and is now getting frustrated with me when I say ""no.""

He bought a buttplug for me to use to stretch myself with anytime I feel like I'd be into it.  We went to the shop together and I picked out one I liked.  I haven't used it much though

At the beginning of our relationship we had been having anal more frequently. This is because I often had anal with the guy I was dating shortly before him, smaller guy.

Every time I have anal with my current bf it is very painful, but they are on top on the pain.  Because of all this I recently told him that I have changed my mind and I decided that I want anal no more than once every two weeks, considering the pain and healing time.  It does make me a little concerned about incontinence later in life as well, considering that there is obvious pain and damage each time, I have told him this concern.

We just had an argument about it, and to be upset with me, and try to make me feel bad about changing my mind on the frequency is not his place, and is very unseemly. 

TL;DR: My boyfriend of 6 months [m32] gets frustrated with me [f25] when I refuse to have anal sex, and causes more pain and a longer healing time than I was used to at the beginning of the relationship when I told him my once per week rule).  I also worry a bit, and have shared this worry, about the possible permanent repercussions of the higher frequency (incontinence).  I can understand his disappointment, but, how can I explain to him that I feel this pressuring, guilt,,1357589416.0,t3_164x7p
1354211525.0,1404pq,I (28m) blew up on my girlfriend (25f) last night after catching her in a lie. What do I make of this?,thrownaway3870,207,52,126,"Ok

Some backstory: My gf, but we've had quite a long, and somewhat rocky, history together but besides all the trouble we've had in the past, I still love her.

Last Wednesday, she told me that she was too tired to do anything, and just wanted to crash. I struggle with insecurity but my gut instinct was that she wasn't being completely truthful with me. I pressed her to at least let me come over for a cigarette (we live very close), but she insisted she wanted to just goto sleep. I asked her multiple times during the following week if she really didn't go out, that it would be okay, i just wanted to be in the loop, but I still heard the same story.

Fast forward to yesterday... I made plans with A to have a night in together where we could just relax and watch movies. After picking her up from work in the afternoon, we head over to the bar and we start our usual routine of beer drinking and dart games but her friend never shows up. Im feeling a little uncomfortable at this point because I am in a bar that I never really goto, full of people that i do not know, while A is bouncing around, chatting with her friends. She introduced me to 3 different people, all while saying ""This is..."" and not ""this is my boyfriend..."" which pissed me off. She said she just forgets, but how do you forget that? Bullshit.

Anyway, the night she so adamantly insisted she was not out for. I was able to confirm with her friend that she actually was there, and had lied to me.

I confronted her about this, and finally she admitted to ""being out for just an hour, and only had one drink"". Which i know isn't the truth either.

At this point, and leave her there. She calls me after 2:00am and says shes walking home. The bar is only about a mile from where I live and I say I'll come for her, so she can at least get home safely. On the ride home, I completely lose it and all I can do is scream at her. 

I feel terrible right now. I dont know whether or not I am being played, any advice would be a huge help. Thanks

tl;dr: Caught girlfriend in a lie and ragequit the bar last night. I dont know if i'm being played or just insecure.

Her prior boyfriend was physically and emotionally abusive. She had trouble getting out of the relationship due to a lack of social outlets.  Once a clean break was made her mother moved in with her for 6 months to keep her company.

She is a wonderful friend and it is not fair for her to not have a rewarding social life.  I do happen to have a great social life and my friends all think she is great.

However, my girlfriend stays at home with her dog and watches tv. Tragically, if I was not in her life this would be a 7 day a week habit.

I have known loneliness before.  She is not open about her frustrations but the are readily apparent.  For obvious reasons much of her happiness depends on me.  I understand and accept this.

However

After a relatively muted fight

Since then she has been in a funk.  I also told her that I was insecure about her feelings for me

If we go the distance

These are difficult areas for me to discuss with my girlfriend because she has a few walls up.  It doesn't help that her abusive ex exploited her loneliness and made her feel unwanted by anyone.

How can I help the love of my life help herself? I want to communicate my hopes to her but thus far all I have done is offend her.

TL;DR - GF has no social life and it affects our relationship and concerns me about our future.

--------------------------------------------------
STATUS UPDATE

I sat her down last night and had a long talk. I told her completely that the threesome was a bad idea in our relationship and that I was very uncomfortable about it and will not go through with it. She understood and was in agreement. But as so many had brought up, that you just don't pick two guys like that that you work with, so quickly. She then said, sorry and that she regrets bringing their names up. I asked her why them and she said, because they remind her of me. WTF? 

I told her my concerns with her and that if she has feeling for them. She told me no, the one guy she mentioned, I think is/was the main target if you will. I've asked about this guy before, and his description has gone from ugly and old, to middle aged, to in his early 40's and cute and now back to old and short. I'm fucking baffled. But one thing I realized as I was talking to her, is that I have no desire to put up with this bullshit. I will not be pushed around if things escalate between them. Simple as that

About our relationship since a few asked. We actually have a great relationship, more than me actually, lol. 

I will say this

Background: New relationship

So on Sat night we were all supposed to hang out.  I didn't go because I had a weird feeling.  He never came home that night.  He never called to say he wasnt coming home.  I KNEW something happened but I didn't make a big deal about it; I just conveyed my disappointment that he didn't think to text me that he was staying out.

He has been even more weird since then.  Hiding his phone, but I went into his phone and looked into his messages.  They slept together, are both torn about it, have been sending emails back and forth over it.  His text said he didn't want to approach me bc we lived together and he was just waiting till I get a car. Oh, and also, THEY DIDN'T USE A CONDOM.  We have had sex maybe 3 times since then.  

I didn't say anything to him about it yet.  I don't know what to do.  I'm not going to freak out and trash his place or sabotage him or anything else crazy

**UPDATE:** 

*So he texted me asking if we could talk tonight, so dont bother going home to take me to work.  He called me twice, I ignored the calls and texted that I needed to weigh the gravity of the situation before I spoke to him.  He said ""what?"" playing stupid.  Or maybe he is.  who knows.  My response ver batim: *I'm not a fool.  I know you slept with A----.  its a shame you couldnt tell me the truth.* (no response, so ten mins later I followed it up with,) *"" You also didnt use a condom with her.  then you slept with me multiple times.  Whats worse is your concern isnt for my health by possibly exposing me to any STD's, but rather more relief that she couldnt get pregnant because you pulled out.""* No response.*  

*5 hours later (I'm at work

*I got myself home (to his dismay) He wants to talk.  Asks if I will talk.  I said ok.  then he waited for me to start.  I told him I had nothing to say to him outside of responding to what he had to say.  then he said ""I'm really sorry"" but like a little kid does when you tell him to not to play with balls in the house and he breaks a vase.  totally insincere.  That was troubling.*

*He admitted it.  He owned up to it.  He also said she's mad at him too (I called BS, it comes out that he ""lost interest"" for me and that if he ""really loved me he knows he wouldnt have cheated in the first place"" While I kind of agree, I wouldnt admit it, instead I explained it seemed liek he was turning it around on me, that it didn't matter, he still did something wrong and knew it was wrong.  He reluctantly agreed.*

*I asked him why, hanging out with her 4-5 nights a week.  ""You dont hang out with me 4-5 night a week.  After you slept with her, you went to the circus with her the next day, by yourselves.  The next night you went to play pool together, by yourselves.  I'm supposed to believe she's mad at you too and that neither of you want anything together?  I give it two more days before you hang out together.  She'd fuck you again too."" OK perhaps my last sentence was out of line but Oh well.*

*He first said I didnt have to leave, he will still take me to work.  He will give me money for a car and a place-- ""FUCK NO.  I dont need your pity, and I don't need your sympathies.  I will sleep on the couch till I make proper arrangements."" He said he would sleep on the couch but I didn't budge.*

*He tried to discreetly blame me here and there but I called him out on it.  he did apologize, and thats why it happened.  I pointed out relationships were about trust and communication, that it was unfair of him to make that decision without trying (honestly he didnt) and without consulting me.*

*I could see he felt bad, you have a lot going for you..."" fuck, that made me sick hearing that.  I simply replied ""not good enough to have your trust, right?"" and let it go.*

Im not really looking for advice at this point


3 weeks ago I was with my fiance putting a check in the bank under our sons name and She breaks up with me. Her main reasoning was that she felt seperated already from me and wanted to see other people. From my point of view at the time I was blindsided and heartbroken


Last November we were arguing alot, by about 15 minutes, she still doesnt talk to me except yell at me for being late. 

I tried to say I tried dispite our fighting and it couldnt have been helped. She ended up leaving quickly and angry. the next monday she tell me she was mad over the weekend and there was a party and she ended up kissing another guy. I was torn up inside


with months to come we had great moments and terrible ones as we were in our own apartment taking turns watching our son. we'd each work but she made more money then i did so pretty much paid for everything. I worked a half hour away like she did but in the other direction


That was partially due to my lack of good health. Im 6'1' 268 lbs (was 286) and i didnt have energy, I enjoyed staying at home with both of them, she on the other hand loved going out. I enjoyed playing my games or working on my model hobby to relax, and i did it so often that i felt like i was always being yelled at and needed a couping method, so i turned to my interests.


Now the guy she ended up kissing months ago moved into her moms house around march because his family moved away... So im like holy F*** I cant get rid of this guy. to make it easier she stayed at her moms occasionally on the weekends with our son because her job is 2 minutes away from that house


we got to the end of our lease at the begining of june and we were looking for apartments together but were still fighting alot. Ultimately we decided to not get another apartment because I couldnt afford it with my job and lack of hours. we decided to get a storage unit and put everything in there until we can get back up where we want to be... Damn that was a mistake.


4 days before we were ready to move I got the shingles. for anyone who knows this virus, and my job had to keep me out of work until i got better. so for the next 2 weeks i couldnt work and didnt get a paycheck. 


We moved apart with our stuff in the storage unit, mine was the 8th, we celebrated both at her moms house which was a party for him on a saturday. it was great for him, but I saw the guy there. The guy she kissed. I wasnt happy, and I looked unhappy too. I felt better once my friends showed up at the party but for the most part i was annoyed he was there.


so 2 weeks and seeing my son 1 more time we got to the bank and had our break up. I cryed.. alot. I cryed more then I ever have. I mean ive gone through breakups and i knew how they hurt, my best friend, and my son all at once. 


I was devestated to say the least. I got in my car, but it got me a better price haha and i signed up. 


I ended up talking to one of her friends who lives 2 miles away from me and explained what i was going through

 I spent over an hour on the phone with her, and i took too long to realize it, she said.. she didnt love me anymore.


My new goals were clear, and said he was a boy and she needs a man. I wasn't that man, and I see that. I loook in the mirror everyday and i want to punch the image because of what i thought was my fault. 

She wanted to go out, along with rent and car insurance, she paid for one of my rent months because i didnt have it.


after the breakup, family, her family, co-workers. everyday i would seek advice from someone, anyone, and id feel good for 10 minutes and like crap for 6 hours. For a guy who slept almost 10 hours everyday I got les then 4 hours each night after the break up, sometimes i didnt get more then 2. 


I changed everything that got me in trouble, and I got a new job, FT 5 minutes from her house so i can see my son at least 5 times a week instead of whenever i can afford to go down there.

 I lost almost 20 lbs by going to the gym whenever i can, and come back and go to school.
I went from doing nothing in my life, i just wish it didnt involve losing them both.


So this is where im at today, and ive gone to the gym the past 5 days in a row thx to my insomiac adrenaline run. I hate not seeing my son grow up so i took a Full time job down by her house and i start it next week, im also keeping this job i have for gas money purposes. This whole thing shook me up, and I was in pain. I wanted to sit in the corner and cry, I still do. My eyes are watering a bit typing all of this, because its painful. Its been almost a month, believe me its still there. 


I have these long term goals after the break up when i should have had them months even years before. I sat on my @$$ and I lost my family because of it. I get the cold shoulder from her anytime shes there and I go to see him. I am mad at myself for being a boy instead of a man for so long


Like I said, needed to write it all down and see it for myself, kind of keep a record of it. I tried the whole journal thing but the papers get wet with my tears and its pretty pathetic. I am continuing to get fit, and im going to get my son in 4 days and have him for 2 days sleeping over. after that i will have 2 jobs so i dont think i will have him as much. I hate myself for letting it get this far, But in a way im glad it happened because I probably wouldnt have changed anytime soon. 


Lastly I want to say that I have every reason to believe she wants nothing to do with me ever again. But im going to continue to try and get my life back, like it or not Im in her life, so I still believe there is a chance that we can work it out later on. Im not a boy anymore, I grew up with a swift kick in the ass. It still hurts, but that pain is a reminder that i have to keep going. If not for the possibility of getting back with her, or for the better of myself, then for my son. He gets 1 father, but im not giving up

I decided to make a new post because I left some key bits of information out of my last post that I think would change a lot of people’s perspectives. Immediately after he broke the windshield he broke down


As far as the constant time with his family


As far as abuse, I’d hightail it as fast as I could at any sign that the man I’m currently with could end up like the man I was with. I didn’t really explain how this was a great relationship because I didn’t think I needed to but he’s only raised his voice a handful of times in the time I’ve known him, always listens to my problems, goes on crazy diets with me to be supportive, wakes up early to make me breakfast every morning before work, is there for me emotionally when I need it and we’ve planned a future together. He’s the primary caretaker of the cats and is wonderful with children. He’s never even remotely lifted a finger toward me or threatened me. In fact, he knew I was so shaken up after my last relationship that he saved money to buy us some expensive self-defense classes so I can feel more comfortable in my own body which might explain the out-of-character stuff punching. People envy our relationship because I think they envy him. This weekend was so freaking out of character that I think it’s the reason I had to post to Reddit about it.


I think everyone’s right, going out for drinks and talking, swimming… fireworks) those are the things that I want to share with just you sometimes. That I NEED to share with just you because I struggle being with people in such intimate situations after awhile. We’re going to make it a point to separate chores and real time together so I don’t feel as neglected in the future.


This weekend was just a shit storm of little things that were unavoidable. The friend gave no notice


So basically, I feel a little distant so I’m not the best audience but I’m trying. This weekend was just a handful of unavoidable bad things that we’re going to work harder to communicate about and avoid in the future.


I should have put all this information in the first post but it would have been so long! I thought I got it across but I realize now I failed. I would like to know if your position remains the same in light of all the new information because maybe I am just wearing rose-colored glasses and need to re-evaluate the relationship but as I stand now I’m not sure it needs such drastic measures.

Anyways, which I had made. I just had some instinct and I decided to snoop. Now he has always been the type of guy to talk down about FB, Instagram, Twitter, etc.. but I saw in his spam folder that he had something on Twitter. I pulled up his page and low and behold.. nothing but flirtatious comments to other girls. Stupid guys always have the same password for everything, so I decided to go on his twitter and look up his messages.. to find that he has been privately messaging a girl since December 2011. He asked her if she would still fuck him.. and she would deny him etc. I also saw in the end of the lind that he had given her his number. Well.. I decided to confront him on that and now he is flipping the script on me.


I decided what best to do but to contact her and find out what really happened... she told me that they had met up a few times and he actually slept over her house in Jan 2012 and he gave her a smooch. Whatever that is. He told her he was homeless and living out of his car... but the backstory to that is:


Ever since I had our son, fed him, etc. While he played video games, go to the gym, and practiced breakdancing... so he claims. I trusted him with all my heart. We were living together in PHX and ended up moving to San Jose where all our parents were and thats when everything went down south. SJ being both our home towns, I felt like he got caught up in the whole being back to his roots and wanting to hang out with his friends.. he started to lack responsibility even more for his son and I. I eventually couldn't take it anymore and told him he was taking us for granted and we didn't want to wait around for him, so I decided to kick him out because I felt like if he wanted to be with his friends so be it... and that's when everything started.


Now after confronting him nearly a year and half later about the situation.. he is telling me that this is all my fault because I didn't have to kick him out. Maybe I resulted into something really drastic but at the time I didn't know how he would understand and thought maybe he would console in his boys to figure out what to do. I take full responsibility for that. Never in my mind would I have thought he was being promiscuous because I had that much faith in him. Yet he is claiming that since someone offered him a bed


TL;DR I feel so low about myself because I have 2 kids with this man.. and he more than likely would have never told me this until I confronted him. I am trying to move on but every second that the moment gets silent.. I just can't help but break down because I felt like I invested so much time in him. I know only time may heal

Hey Guys. This is the second update.

I met with her yesterday to pick some things up, the weekend and so on. Pretty nice talk actually.

Then, because 5 years are not so easy to walk off. But, she said, ""In the moment i think it was not the wrong thing for breaking up"". And, I must say, I could relate. If everything falls apart and you need to learn to live on your own... i guess i would not have broken up, but i would have wanted distance. 
Either way, and we both said that we don't want to lose each other, so we keep contact regulary and meet up sometimes. But, with distance. 
I guess i can live with that for the moment
I don't know if she managed to grief about her loss

TL;DR:

So, much laughter and keep in touch because we both want it. i can't say if something new emerges out of it. But I'm confident.

I keep you updated.

My mother has given me a five-year time limit on grandchildren, that the ex-boyfriend (of five years) which my family was very close with, was the love of my life, and that I will never have something as great as he was.  This, mostly, was because he desired marriage and offspring.

I'd ultimately like to get married, and that my decisions to delay ""mature adulthood"" are consistently being looked down upon by my friends and family, and that they believe that my relationship is going nowhere because this isn't the end goal.  They've even got me believing this tripe.

I get it, as there are fantastic people that don't marry until their middle years, or don't marry at all.  However, with the immense peer pressure that I'm encountering, I don't know how to cope.

Unfortunately he's been sending me on a ruthless guilt trip all day. I guess now we aren't speaking
I just hope that most of you are right and he will get over it soon.** 

I'll try to keep this short

My brother and I have had a pretty good relationship our whole lives

My brother wants to buy a new car.

Yesterday my brother had a big falling out with my father because he asked if my father would cosign

At first I said I'd see if I could get approved. I have never cosigned for anything, and I'm really not sure I want to be held responsible for making the payments if he cannot.

He wants me to cosign on a **$20

I bring home about $500-600 a month. **I only make $9/hr**

I do not own a home. **I live with our father** so I can put more of my money towards my schooling.

**It's not that I don't trust my brother** about making car payments. **It's that he is currently working as a temp**, he swears that they are about to make him full time, it will just take six months to do so and he needs a car now because his current one is falling apart.

**I feel like I shouldn't cosign until the company decides to actually take him on as an employee**.

**My father and I had another idea.**

I drive my father's **2005 Chevy Trailblazer** right now. He was about to **sell it** (I will drive another of my dad's cars to/from work). We decided that **instead of selling the 05 Trailblazer**

His response to that idea?

**"" No. I don't want an SUV. Sorry.""**

The car he wants is a **brand new 2012 Toyota** with all the bells and whistles, etc.

Now, and basically **making me feel like a really bad person** for not wanting to cosign on his car. It's getting to the point where it's actually **stressing** me out, and **he holds grudges**. Big time. I'm afraid this won't go away for quite a while.

My question is, which is possible because like I said, he is only a temp.

**Was I in the wrong

I thought about telling him to just go ahead and see if I can get approved as his cosigner

Thanks everyone that gave me advice yesterday-all of you were insightful and no one made me feel like a cold-hearted jerk for finding the situation to be troubling.  


So I didn't ask the bf about his ex all day yesterday-I felt I was not in the right place to talk about it, a loooong shower and went to bed super early.
  


This morning, he wanted to talk her down a bit, because he's one HELL of a wonderful guy.  About 5 minutes in, he heard a female voice in the background.  He asked who it was, and Cait replied it was a friend from work.  When bf realized she had someone with her, he told her he needed to go.



So, but assumed the worst.



Now, in about the same words.  He wholeheartedly agreed.  He said while he considers her a friend, he didn't think they were that close and was pretty confused why she would call him.  Although, he did say she was known as a prolific drunk dialer back when they were dating.  



He said that Cait had called to apologize during the day.  On the phone call


He said he was sorry either of us had to be woken up for it and that her ringtone is now silent.  She mentioned she had an appointment with a councilor today to talk.  I told the boyfriend that I wish there was a way we could ensure that she was truly getting help.  Then he questioned, or even much about her in general....I just didn't know what the right thing to do was and I was sorry.



We (really he) decided that he would write her an e-mail asking about the councilor and what the facility was that she was going to so that we could check it out/make sure she's being seen.  He said he wanted to make it clear to her that she had to give him this information-kind of like 'if you're gonna be calling me at 4am



My boyfriend tells me sometimes I have great 'emotional wisdom'.  That I seem to be good at stepping back from a situation and evaluating it from all angles to consider all parties, he doesn't give himself enough credit.  He's such a caring thoughtful guy without being gullible (honey, do you think she is just crazy and looking for attention?  or is this a real cry for help?).I am happy that he has a plan to make sure she's being cared for, as well as a plan to make the boundaries of their relationship, as he sees it, clear.  I'm also happy that we see eye to eye on where those boundaries are.  


I am happy he is so open with the information

I genuinely enjoy being with him, generally I'm willing to try stuff but he can tell when it doesn't turn me on in the same way). So he goes to the internet for porn/chat from time to time. In general I'm OK with this as long as its anon and doesn't involve real information/names/potential to get out of hand. Well I found some IRC chat logs the other day that really bothered me to the point where I've told him its a deal breaker. For one there is a theme of incest with his sister when he was a teenager. The bigger issue is there is a theme of attraction to one of his stepdaughters. That he basically wants to seduce one of them when she is older. I get that this is fantasy but it comes from somewhere

TL;DR 
Boyfriend of 2 years fantisizes about being with my daughter but hasn't acted on it and doesn't plan to. Is this a deal breaker? Or should I give him a shot to try counselling. 

Update: I want to reassure everyone that I did leave, cars, etc together and there are things we do need to work out. I'm sorry if it came across as pathetic to ask. I know I could never have looked at him the same way again and it's very easy when I have to look at him to know what I need to do.

This morning we hooked up and he opened bedside table drawer to get the lube. 

As long as I've known him the drawer had a cooler bag with a few condoms in it.  The number of condoms have not changed over the past 2 years.

This morning there were about 20+ (a box worth?) of new condoms in the cooler bag.

I politely asked him about this 10 minutes later

He responded:  He recently bought them to check and see if his Best Buy Credit Card would work in other stores.

I then asked him if he was planning on using the condoms.

He said no of course not.

I told him it was weird and he said he was just trying to buy something cheap to see if the card worked.

I see a lot of things wrong in this response.  But I left quietly trying to decide if I should believe him or not.

Am I over-thinking this or does his response not make any sense?   Also I don't think you can use a best buy card outside the store.

He is usually so trustworthy this is out of the ordinary for me to question something he says. I want to bring it up to him again and tell him I want to believe him but his response just does not make any sense.

Thank you everyone for your advice and input, maybe I'll post another update a few weeks from now...? Either way

You can read the [original post here](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1bxdbf/my_f26_boyfriend_m25_of_7_years_took_pictures_of/).

I feel like the comments were split into the ""dealbreaker"" ""not a big deal"" and ""big deal, and advice about a situation I can't talk to my friends or family about due to embarrassment on my part and for him. It's still a little soon for me to form coherent thoughts, so please excuse my word wall as I update. Scroll down for the TL;DR.

So he came home from work and we talked about it. It was really difficult. I cried, it was a complete lapse in judgement, he was disgusted with himself and his actions and thought he had deleted everything. He said as soon as he saw them in his email he felt sick and immediately deleted them. He seemed pretty horrified by his actions because of the whole invasion of privacy and general scumbagginess of what he did.

He admitted he was being purposefully deceitful and wanted them for later, is so out of character and sickening. It's hard to believe some of this part.

Though I can't be sure he's telling me the truth or all of the truth, because obviously he violated the trust in our relationship and was deceitful. But even though it's hard, I really think I believe him.

Ultimately, and I would have been blissfully unaware that he finds my friend's ass attractive. It would have been better if it was a stranger, I'm not gonna lie. It hurts more because it's my friend and I was there too. I just wish he didn't do such a creepy fucking thing.

It's not about finding other women attractive or looking at other women. It's also not about me putting my own insecurities about not being as attractive as someone else or not having the perfect body into our relationship or this situation. I know he loves me and my body and is attracted to me, I just believe it was a one-time mistake. I sort of have to if I want to move forward.

I don't really think this is the end of this issue/fight/problem in our relationship. I think good people do bad things, more than anything in the world, and I believe that he loves me the same way. So to me it's worth it to try to work past this.

We get along great most of the time
I am nowhere near a neat freak, we usually try to clean one day a week and spend 1-3 hours doing it depending on how dirty the house is. We have 2 dogs and 2 cats and friends come over and we don't clean during the week so it's usually decently dirty by then and it definitely needs to be done. We don't go crazy over the top, we just clean what we have to. (We have tried more frequent cleaning with less time spent, but it doesn't happen because we're so busy.) 
So
I feel like his mom because I constantly have to remind him to do his share and I even have to make sure he actually cleaned what was his pre-agreed to part of the cleaning that day. As in, completely disregarding the sink, toilet bowl, and under the seat which gets pretty dirty in a week. All I ask is he wipes it with a lysol wipe. It really drives me crazy that he can't put the effort in to do something so simple. There are countless other examples that I can't be bothered to type. 

It's not the cleaning that bothers me, it makes me wonder what can I expect from the future?

Am I crazy that this bothers me so much? Or does he really just need to learn to grow up and clean a damn toilet, and do it right! As much as I hate to admit, it really makes me lose respect for him. 
It's been a big issue for about three years. I continuously lower my expectations for cleaning in an effort to compromise

How can I get him to truly work on this instead of just saying he will? How could we better handle cleaning?
We have tried short frequent bursts of cleaning, working together, working at the same time but on separate things, cleaning while the other is out of the house, lists... Everything I can think of. 

TL;DR: Everything else in our relationship is perfect, is causing now-constant fighting and is threatening to break us up. How can we make this better? 




edit/update: Thanks so much for all of the advice, and he actually came home last night with the idea of having three tasks (can be anything, big or small) that we decide to complete throughout the day! So we will definitely try that, see about getting a maid, and I will definitely lay off a little and pick my battles more wisely.

First I want to thank everyone for their contributions to the original thread. You all helped me immensely in my time of need - thank you.

The days following this post I kept trying to get my SO (M/28) to go on video chat so I could confront him about the cheating. He kept refusing - saying he didn't feel like it, etc. So we'd make small talk on chat or through text and then I'd make myself unavailable. He seemed to be fine with not talking to me which was so frusturating. 

The first week on my own was very tough. I desperately wanted someone to talk to about this, and I'd think of him and just break down crying. My emotions were getting the better of me, I was swinging from one end of the spectrum to the other - from wanting to tell him it's okay, he's forgiven, we all make mistakes, to cleaning all my stuff out of the apartment and cutting him out of my life, or even doing something crazy like sleeping with another guy to make my SO feel the pain I'm feeling. Thankfully these were just fleeting

After a week or so I decided enough was enough - I texted my SO and told him we needed to talk on Skype NOW. He reluctantly accepted and logged on. Even with the grainy resolution of his webcam you could just see guilt / grief written all over his face.

I wanted to give him a chance to confess on his own. I asked him what was wrong a few times, etc. It didn't take long for him to crack - through quivering lips he said ""You're going to fucking hate me..."" and then told me the whole story, nearly verbatim to what he told his friend. He added that he'd been avoiding talking to me these last few days because he's ""a chickenshit"".

I just let him keep talking and apologizing. He told me he's been miserable since he left

I was fighting back tears throughout most of it but I think I did well to keep my composure. I told him how disappointed I was, and we'd talk when he gets back.

He's sent me a lot of texts in the days following our Skype video chat... more apologizing, and he seems to have gotten the hint. 

I'm still very unsure about what I'm going to do. Right now I am leaning toward leaving him.  He was sincerely apologetic, and now it feels tainted, like the whole dynamic of our relationship will be different if we stay together. 

This could all change when we finally talk in person though - he's due back on November 30th

I clearly told her that A: I'm married (she knew this already). B: I was definitely not interested in infidelity. C: She was absolutely not my type (perhaps irrelevant

She was still making a scene and I decided the best thing was to signal the waiter to put the lunch on the company account and just leave and head back to work. I talked to her manager and she will get a few days paid leave on my expense account

In the end I made myself clear, and her boss are happy with this solution, my wife is still a bit red faced, but strangely flattered.

The backlash of this entire event will be interesting though

Anyway

ps: Last time the automod failed so I will just say :

I love my SO with everything I have - he means the world to me - and I would in no way EVER want to trade being with him for the single life, such as having heaps of time to myself (I'm a huge introvert/homebody) or not having to consult/think of anybody else's feelings when changing things about myself (""Will I be less attractive to him if I...?"").

So yes. In no way do I want to be single again - I want to spend the rest of my life with this man - but just sometimes miss some aspects of how life was for me beforehand. Am I alone in this or does everybody get this once in a while?

My SO's family (according to him) has been disappointed/mad with him since he started college.  Every decision was the wrong one (his major, etc).  They still loved and supported him, but they went anywhere from picking at him about stuff (kind of innocently) to being extremely pissed at him for some decision he made.  No matter what, he was always the one who messed up (while his sister was considered perfect).  

Now, international travel, our dog, etc.  We do not do drugs, we rarely drink, we are pretty happy and funny people.  Honestly, from an objective view, I have not been around them where they did not criticize him

On Saturday, but we don't entertain them at our apartment.  We don't see them often, because they upset us so much with their words and they upset me and he hates it.  So anyway, they stop by and see that he isn't there and they sit me down and say things....to just hurt me, I guess.

They say:

-He hasn't been happy or well mannered since he started dating me.

-He should have proposed by now (implying that if he hasn't then he doesn't want to).

-His hobbies are stupid, and I'm stupid for putting up with them (he plays mtg, has played on the pro tour, and has a business related to it - it doesn't bother me, I'm proud of him); oh god...and they also said that playing too many ""fantasy"" games is what leads to school shootings (Did I mention my SO is a well adjusted, 28 year old professional and nice man?).

-When they disapproved of one of his last gfs (which they felt entitled to do) he just shut off from them and started acting the same way he is acting with me) implying that he does this when he ""has something to hide.""

-They told me he lies to me about everything and I shouldn't believe him. (wtf? this made me feel incredibly uncomfortable)

-They told me that it ""wasn't my fault"" that he didn't talk to them very much, apparently)

-They said they won't be happy for us when we get engaged

-They straight up lied about a situation where he interacted with his sister.  She does whatever they say and will make him look bad for fun, and they told me that he is incredibly rude to his family (since dating me) and that its unacceptable.

-I can't even remember all the things they blamed me for,""  invited me over to their house even if he didn't want to come, talked about their future grandkids (from me), told me they just wanted us to be happy and for him to stop acting this way, etc.  They put me through a complete emotional rollercoaster of ugly insults, to familial invitations.

My SO has already told me that he doesn't respect these people.  While they have supported him plenty, they just pretend they can't hear, and somehow turn it around on him.  Its exhausting.  Also, if it is important, their actions within the last 10 years are bad and insulting, but they were also physically and emotionally abusive parents when he was younger.  I would rather not go into that. 

So thats it.  I can either choose to keep trying with these people (which is a lose situation, involving them in our life) or I can tell him that I'm OK with him cutting them off completely (something he is more than happy to do).  But I feel like those are both losing situations.  

They have beaten me down so much with all the things they have piled on me. I'm so tired and I'm seriously considering not being involved anymore.  

Is breaking up a terribly selfish thing to do when my actual relationship with my SO is good?  I love him and care for him very much.  He is on my side, but at the same time, I cannot deal with them anymore.  I know the general consensus in threads like these is that ""your SO needs to be on your side and tell his parents that their behavior is unacceptable.""  But that is easier said than done.  He is on my side.  He has told them he is happy with me, and he has told them the reasons he does not want to talk to them and it has nothing to do with me, but they literally refuse to believe it.  The refuse to believe they have ever done anything wrong and the more he tried to convince them that I haven't done anything wrong, the more they believe that it is me who is at fault, and I'm the reason he doesn't want their company.

I have tried speaking on my own behalf.  I have tried telling them that I love him, since that is a personal thing. They do not accept ANYTHING I say. Talking to them has proven fruitless.

I'm so tired reddit.  I don't know how to be supportive and sane anymore and I'm extremely wary of telling my SO that it is time to cut them off.  I'm afraid that is a drastic step, but his sister too, and that is harder.

Any insight would be appreciated.

1344206984.0,xqg09,My story - hopefully can help others,CutterRoberts,173,29,31,"So this may be long

I am recently divorced. I met a (well I thought) wonderful woman in college and married her last year. She was from a really conservative home

Early last year I became depressed. Not about our marriage, or sexual ( went about from sex every 2 days to every week). While my wife tried to be supportive, she became distant, was very rude when she spoke to me, and avoided and shrugged off any affection I offered. 

After starting counseling, as I discovered this on Christmas Eve. 

So in a span of a month, and she cheats. I confronted her and asked for a divorce. After a few days we reconcile and her family offers supports and tries to help us. After about a month, she continues her affair, sexting the other man off and on for a few months. The last time we had sex was a few days after they ended their contact; I felt like a consolation prize. She continue to blame my depression for her behavior, claiming I made her do it (total bullshit). She also called me socially awkward and claimed my foot fetish was weird (that one hurt a lot). About a month later we begin divorce proceedings. The divorce will be final later this month.

I wanted to tell my story for a few reasons. 

First, successful relationships and sexual experiences, and overcoming hard times, it is really encouraging to read. 

Second, happiness, and acceptance of my relational and sexual self. Divorce and break ups hurt like hell, but it can teach us to never settle, treat ourselves with dignity, and how to make yourself happy when you need to. Finding some purpose or meaning behind this has been crucial to me becoming who I am now.

The next week, and then when she started to feel sick, she went to the doctor to see if she was pregnant. Sure enough, the doctor told her to start taking prenatals. She's going back for an STD test later this week.

She is so scared right now. She feels like she is having her life ripped away from her. She refuses to have an abortion (it's against her conscience) and she is reluctant to consider adoption because her mother desperately wants to be a grandmother and she doesn't know how many other opportunities she'll have to have kids in the future because of certain medical problems her family has.

No man in her life has ever treated her like she mattered. Her dad doesn't talk to her, she has difficulty trusting me, which makes helping her through this even more difficult.

I told her I would support her in whatever she decides to do. Everyone around me tried to talk me out of that, I feel like she thinks I don't believe her, at least, not fully.

It also doesn't help that the people around her are accusing her of getting pregnant on purpose, and I don't know how much longer she can take it. She already suffered from depression before this, but now it's escalating. I'm more worried about her now than I've ever been.

This weekend, but at 3am I am ready to go. I don't immediately find him and he is not picking up his phone. Searched the main areas of the house, no luck. Then I think to check Tyler's room. The door was not shut tight. I pushed it open further and see Sean and Tyler making out. Like sitting upright on Tyler's bed, but kissing with their arms around each other. It did not look like a joke.

Neither of them saw me. I was mortified and turned around and went downstairs. After a moment of panic I went upstairs again calling Sean's name and he came out of the room, he passed out and I stayed up all night crying on the computer.

I could not bring this up with him yesterday. I was just moody and distant all day and told him I was hungover. I'm at a loss for words. Actually I am panicking right now. I had such an amazing relationship with him and now it's ruined. Not only has he been wonderfully sweet and supportive thus far

What the fuck do I do now? Do I just end this? Can I give him another chance? Is he gay/bi? Do bisexual men cheat on their girlfriends because they are dissatisfied with just one gender?

Husband (early 30s) and I (late 20s female) have been married for five+ years

Three years ago, so we were extremely careful. 

Before I get raked over the coals for tricking him into fatherhood, sort of like a minor inconvenience since it wasn't planned. Though I was happy, I wanted to discuss adoption with my husband, as I knew he was against having bio kids. 

My husband, my husband basically had a nervous breakdown: he became ill (shaking to the point of dry heaving), screaming, weeping, threatening to kill himself, threatening to drop from the PhD program, screaming at me to get an abortion, blaming me for ""tricking"" him, I agreed to have an abortion. 

I hated him for convincing me to agree to something I was so personally against. The next day, he was outside of the door thanking god and weeping for joy.

Though this was three years ago, though he did see a (really shitty) therapist, it didn't help and he continued to have anxiety and panic attacks over the course of the last three years. I even switched jobs and moved 2000 miles away to help his anxiety (so he could be closer to his family), but he ended up having another severe panic attack/breakdown that basically lasted three months after the move.

His anxiety has worn me down to a point where I am not even trying in our marriage anymore. I just constantly expect him to overreact and have completely pulled away from him in preparation of his anxiety. In July, but I don't see how him getting better is helping me because: 

a) We can't afford two therapists

b) We never see each other or talk. He leaves to exercise as soon as I get home from work

c) I don't trust him with my emotions. Every time I convince myself to fall back in love with him

Though he is trying, but he's not sorry for it. I have tried to forget what he did and be proud that he is learning how to better cope, but the expectation that he could have another attack like that really bothers me. I can't go through it again. I just can't.

Yes, I was sick with anorexia and a hormone disorder for a long time, too, so that I'm sure partially contributed to his anxiety so, yes, my fault. I take that responsibility.

Other than the GAD and depression, and used to be able to talk about anything. He's a nice guy that just refused for so long to get help, but I don't know if it's just too late. For sixty percent of our marriage, we are best friends. The other forty percent of the time, I hate him.

When do you decide a marriage is over? I don’t think I can mentally last through another anxiety attack with him and the fear of that attack is a burden. Is it time to call it quits?

TL;DR: Husband with severe anxiety celebrated my miscarriage. I can’t get over it. Should I divorce him? 

**Edit**: Wow, it's really gotten to me. For one reason, his defense (of dissertation) has been pushed back four times without regard to my very tight schedule (it was supposed to be finished in June and now I have to use sick days to take time off work for it). Secondly, he's finishing his degree this semester and has refused to find a job for next semester. Thirdly, I've pushed off two degree programs and he basically told me to push it off for yet another year until he's settled with a job (though, now I have doubts that he will be able to hold a job with so much anxiety).

I think I do know it's over. I don't want to hurt him because, I'm absolutely terrified of starting over. I'm so so so so scared of making the wrong choice, but it's gotten to the point where I'm in such fear of the ""bad times"" I can't enjoy our ""good times."" Thank you for your advice. I'm going to wait to talk about a separation until after his defense - it's only another two months away. I can last.

I just got done reading the first thread. After I realized I wasn't going to get help on Reddit (you all really did help; but I gave up after like an hour of no comments)

There are a few things I need to point out. I probably should have mentioned this in my original post, he's on probation for something else (non-violent crime).

Some people wondered if he has ever hit (my fiancee). I am not totally sure about this

A lot of people thought that she grew up in an abusive family. As far as I know the answer is no, so there might be a chance, but it really seems like she would have told me if he was.

I'm not sure who knew about her brother's abuse. I certainly never knew about it. I think my fiancee had reason to believe her brother was abusing his wife, there is no way I'm staying with her. I think her parents knew, but I'm even less sure about this.

This morning

I had texted my fiancee and told her where I was staying

After thinking about everything with a better mind (obviously emotions were high when I made my post yesterday), but she has never acted like that before, so I hope it's just emotions that she's able to work through. I don't know how long yet, I guess whenever she's ready. I realize there is still a good chance we may break up, but if she agrees to go to counseling and reacts well next time we talk, I hope we can salvage this. Even if we do salvage everything, I'm definitely going to put the wedding on indefinite hiatus.

During college I would drive 900 miles round trip to visit her every 2 weeks and we talked every night on the phone. We were really, my wife was a very loving person while I was just nice. She made me food almost every night and was essentially the perfect wife. Looking back

I, and our days would pass just surfing the internet together on the couch. She had to ask me to do everything, from cleaning to going out on the weekends, and I was always happy to do anything, except to think of it myself. My wife is a very passionate person and my apathy was tantamount to abuse that eventually boiled over 3 years ago. There are two big examples I can think of: 

1 - I was going on a 10 day trip and she was really sad that I was leaving. Conversely, or arranging times to talk, nothing. I didn't talk to her about it because I didn't care about how it might affect her, and it didn't affect me.

2 - We moved to a small(er) city for her surgical residency program. At the time, where there were plenty. I was ready to fly out for 5 days a week and I never really considered taking a ""lesser"" job so that I could stay to be with my wife. :( (she didn't have a choice where she was matched into residency, they tell you where you're going to go)

Anyways, I didn't really understand wtf was going on, and real strides in me being a caring individual didn't really happen until the past 1.5 years or so. I never was a really caring person. When I was a kid I was content to lie on a couch playing with a pen for hours. When my relationship with my father became strained, it never really bothered me. True empathy, where I feel what the other person is feeling, completely eluded me. During the past 3 years I had to learn all this shit.

Meanwhile our life has been a living hell. I've been called every name in the book and things have gotten physical. I've lost count of the number of times she's told me that she wishes that I would just step in front of a bus and die so she could move on with her life. I've tried to leave several times, telling me that I had made things even worse because I was abandoning her, which I was. 

So here I am, fuck that noise, I'm taking us to a happier place. When she blows her lid over stupid stuff, I pause to realize why, so I can apologize for the real reason. For example, I was slow in helping her cook about a week ago, and I knew that she wasn't pissed because I was slow, and had I

Things are getting better, I'm able to shut things down where before it could last for days until she just ran out of energy. Sometimes she still asks if I love her. But the lows are frequent and deep, and honestly I can see it effecting me, now. I'm more angry - I'll swear a storm if I drop shit on the floor. If she throws a fit and then goes to work, I'll break some trivial shit like a chopstick or slam shit around. One day she was angry and I was doing my best to manage it, telling her that I loved her. She said something mean, to the effect of, I don't, and when I got back she had a knife next to her and told me that if I ever scared her again like that

I'm afraid that the positive in my life will be the absence of pain. I'm afraid that she will never come around and be unhappy for the rest of our life. I'm afraid that I'll sink in to the same hole I put her into and then we'll be two bitter people together. I hate this. I hate where I put her. If I had been half the man I am today when we met this never would have happened. I'll do anything, and I'm scared that I won't be able to find her again.

Bonus question--telling the ex?,no_bill_savage,192,47,70,"My gf (44), so it was completely unplanned and on the up and up). We do things as a ""family"" all the time--the four of us just got back from Xmas at my parents, Suzy takes my daughter to get pedicures together

I've been divorced for 3 years. The divorce was traumatic for my son, and hospitalized for over a month. So it was a double whammy for the kids--divorce and dad almost died. (They don't know that my ex was cheating on me, I found that out right before I was diagnosed with cancer, and she left me for the cheater after my first cancer surgery, and before my second and chemo. Bah. Like a bad soap opera or something.)

After recovery, and it's terrific. I guess what I'm wondering about is whether:
1. I should tell my kids before I go away with Suzy for New Year's Eve (kids will be with their mother for a few days) or after I get back. 
2. And then whether I should tell the kids separately

Do any of you have any experiences to share

I lean towards telling them by myself, assuming she says yes, but I wouldn't ask if I didn't think she would. I'm not that much of an idiot. Shit. I hope.) My son is still a bit sad about the divorce. I think I might want the slight gap there for him to adjust to the news, and be a bit sad if necessary. But I truly think he'll be fine, he likes to goof off with Suzy, and sees her every day at school (she is not his teacher, but they see each other in the hallways). 

Suzy would be absolutely fine with such an approach--she has no kids of her own (was never able to conceive during her previous marriage) but is such a super teacher and camp counselor etc.

I'm reaching out to y'all here because I don't have anyone else I feel comfortable asking

And now the bonus question--I feel like I should tell my ex-wife pretty quickly after I tell my kids, drive them home (only a mile) and drive back right away and tell the ex FIRST, then go back and tell my kids second.  (NOT worried about my ex's reaction--heck, she had a new guy before she even told me she was done with me!!)

Oy. Am I over-thinking things? I now kind of feel like by typing this out I am thinking through to a good solution--but please, and even the benefit of your experience would help. Thanks so much.

We've been talking about getting married in the next year or two (we're students so we have to plan far ahead). 

Lately we've been fighting a lot. Some is stress-related from our recent move to a new town, etc. Some is related to our problematic sex life (we both want it but aren't giving each other the right things.) But we've always made up afterwards, and I thought things were going to be worked out and get better. It seemed hopeful.

Last night he randomly says he's going out, texts around 8:30pm asking how I am. I say great but I'm bored and want to enjoy the weekend a little, too.. maybe I could join him? He doesn't respond. A couple hours later he texts me saying he's in the next city over, walking into random bars. I was feeling uneasy, but I say Okay, have fun! 

At close to 1am, then say ""Call me from the hotel room when you get there, please"" just for peace of mind that he made it there safely. I was also starting to feel suspicious and thought if he called, it would help ease my mind a little. He doesn't respond. I call him after about 15 minutes and his phone sends me straight to voicemail. 

After a couple hours laying in bed unable to sleep

TL;DR: So, told me he was getting a hotel room for himself but I know he didn't from our credit card statements online, and his phone is off. All this after we've had a rough couple weeks fighting about all manner of things. What can I take from this (cheating?) and how should I approach him when he comes home today? 

P.S. Anon account here since he's a redditor.

EDIT: So

EDIT 2: He just called me. First from a Blocked number which he left a voicemail. I couldn't call him back on that number, ""I can't return your call when the number is Blocked."" Then he called on his cellphone, and said it was his hotel room, he didn't know why it was blocked. 

He then told me he had stayed at a Marriott where he didn't have to pay because he had these points racked up from an old business account (isn't that great?!). I said, ""No, that's your business. I couldn't care less about the drinking, but I feel suspicious like you're hiding something from me."" He then said he was catching a bus and had to go. WHAT. 

EDIT 3: Okay, then sent me a bunch of texts talking about how happy he is with me, etc. I replied saying, ""That is so nice to hear, babe. I think we have some issues to discuss tonight when you get home, though. I love you"" So right now, I am sensing that he's going above and beyond to make me feel like everything is okay when we both know it isn't. I'll let you know what happens tonight.

Oh well. So it goes... although you'd think that when I mentioned that I'd be out of town that weekend for my friend's birthday, she'd be like ""Oh wait! Don't commit to that! We have plans!

Yes, as she promised. I have been trying my best to follow her lead and read her signals. We've continued being intimate, at her enthusiastic consent.

While she seems to be doing better (just recognizing it and getting it off her chest and getting to therapy seems to have made worlds of difference), I've been having erectile dysfunction and difficulty achieving orgasm.

We kiss and do foreplay and everything is great. I have no problem getting hard. It isn't until we've already started having sex that I start having problems cumming and start going soft. And I know that it's all in my head. I'm enjoying myself and then I start becoming hyperaware of her moans- I keep double-taking to make sure they're actually moans and she's not crying or in pain. When she moves against me I get worried that she's struggling.

If she moves in a certain way or makes a certain noise I think I'm hurting her and start to go soft. Then I start to wonder how he could feel her struggle, and still do what he did. And then I go really soft.

So far

I know that bringing this up in therapy is a must, and I hate this guy with every fiber of my being. I've had more than one violent fantasy about killing or castrating him (or both).

My (33yo) wife of 5 years has recently told (38 yo) me ""You are a great dad and a great person, have a son together and our other kids from a previous marriage have pretty much grown up together as a family. I don't want a divorce but I am so confused and scared. I know it isn't always sparkles and rainbows in a marriage, sometimes it is work but I can never just not be attracted to or love my wife that way.

Some background. **The bad:** I am very sexual and kinda kinky, she was always an exhibitionist of sorts and since it turned her on showing off, it turned me on as well. She started to do webcam modeling and seemed to enjoy that, made good money, we had great sex. I would often watch and we would have sex during her break between cam modeling. Then one day she changed. She said she wanted to quit modeling and having sex with other women together. I agreed, I didn't want it to ruin our relationship and if she didn't want to then it was over. Looking back I think this did a lot of damage to her emotionally. I don't think we understood the consequences.

It has been 2 years since we stopped. Since that time I started noticing changes in our sexual relationship. First we stopped having sex while facing each other (her choice, or ""what are you talking about?"" responses. 

This last year we bought a new house, stopped yelling at each other when we got into arguments. This is also the year she started drinking though. At first it was a glass of wine once or twice a day. Then it became a bottle a day. I also noticed we wouldn't have sex unless she was drinking. We had a few arguments about it, I knew bringing it up would just cause her to drink more. A couple of months ago she decides to quit. I was so glad, she just decided to stop and she did. Things seemed to be going great. Sex wasn't as often as I wanted but she has also been a bit sick and would use that as an excuse.

2 weeks ago she drops the bomb on me. I noticed around Xmas she was edgy and I could feel her pushing me away. She apologized for being distant and things were ok for a few weeks. She started being distant again then I got the friend zone talk.

I am so confused. She said she is not interested in sex anymore. I asked if it was someone else, it's me, I just have no interest in sex"". She says she still loves me. She is also still somewhat affectionate to me. She hugs me, holds my hands sometimes. Then sometimes she is cold, distant and non affectionate (which confuses me even more). I don't remember the last time she said I love you. I try talking with her, she just says ""I don't know, or I don't know what is wrong"". Then she pretends nothing is wrong, she did not enjoy it whatsoever. I have been giving her space. I scheduled an appointment with a marriage counselor. She said she wants to work on our marriage. I am just not sure it is sincere. I am willing to wait and work it out. I don't want our son to be in a divorced family. I still love her.

At first I thought it was me. I have gained a bit of weight over the years. I actually weigh a lot less than I did 3 years ago when our sex life was AOK

**TLDR;** Wife and I had threesomes with other women (her idea), doesn't feel sexual at all towards me. I don't want a divorce. Confused, scared.


**EDIT:** Thank you everyone who has been helpful. I appreciate the different perspectives given which is why I did this in addition to seeking counseling. It is incredibly personal and was difficult for me to write but I think people are generally good and well meaning and many of you have proven to be. Seeing a counselor next week.

He's almost 40 years old and he was speaking like a teenager.  I can't get his voice out of my head!!!  I cant unhear what I heard.  I feel sick to my stomach.  

He doesn't know that I know.  He will be very embarrassed when he realizes what I heard him say.  He has ALWAYS led me to believe that he is a gentleman who talks about women with kindness and respect.  After what I heard today....  fuck.  He's not respectful at all.  I have had no contact with him since this pocket dial.  I don't know what to do.

Thanks for all of your helpful insights on the previous posts. Another life lesson learned. 

**TL;DR** I broke up with her via text message and now I miss her dog so much.

It didn't go as well as I would like it to be. I've been busy working last week and was only able to squeezed 1 night to talk to her. I had it all plan out in my head while driving up to her place. I was going to casually take her out to eat so I could tell her about it outside her own  home (later on, but she was feeling nauseated (most likely pregnancy-related symptoms). We just went on like usual dinner.

I didn't want to do break up while she feeling sick so we just went back to her place and I ended up staying the night at her place. We got hungry around 3 am and she suggested going to denny's for early breakfast before going back to sleep (she work night shift and I work in the afternoon). She said she feeling a lot better

So we went back to her place again after denny's and we both went to sleep. I left her place in the afternoon to work. When I got to work

She knew it then and there what's the ""talk"" is all about and text me that she was upset and she rather have this talk at her place last night. I apologize if I making her upset right before going to work

Fast forward to tonight. I text her again and asked how she's doing. She said she was doing okay. We then starting discussing about the text from last week. She was still upset about it. She wished it could have happen in person. She told me she had many things to say to me and none of it was bad or mean. She said she wanted to close this chapter with me by saying all the nice things about me

I told her that I also enjoy the companionship and agreed on the future snowboarding plan. I told that I wish her and the baby the best and asked her to say hi to her dog for me. (I really gonna miss that fluffy

Situation now:
The baby is 5 months old, she works and tries to provide for them, but she has made a few stupid decisions that makes it harder. My husband put a word in for her for a better paying job with better hours, but she got lazy and never turned her resume in. The baby is at our place for an unknown amount of hours every day (I'm not sure whether it is just the job or whether she goes and does other things while the baby is here too), which makes it hard for me to plan anything and getting anything done outside the house.

This might be a little different if it wasn't winter or if she would pack enough warm clothing for the baby

The baby also often arrives with not enough formula or not enough diapers. Sometimes the bottle doesn't make it here. I have developed a secret stash of supplies for emergencies, so she is forced to go back and get one.

I want to make a point of the fact that her situation is very little like that of a typical single mother. She lives with parents, phone bill and other everyday costs are taken care of. All she has to do is go to work, other than that she's not really busy in any way. And while her parents insist that she pays me at least some money for watching the baby, she very rarely does. I mean, once in three weeks or so, she hands be a hundred bucks. 

The reason why this annoys me is because at this point I can work again. When I mentioned going back to work

But because my husband and I can get by without me working, yes, I have a lot of free time so why not. But at the same time, I didn't run around and get knocked up, this is not my responsibility. It's not my child, I didn't choose to have it. And I shouldn't be guilt tripped into watching her for 40 hours a week without getting paid (and with spending money on supplies) just because I have time to do it. 

I feel like she is using the fact that I am available and it wouldn't be polite of me to say no.. 

Does this makes sense at all? Or I am just being a brat? Would I be a horrible person to say - hey


TL:DR - sister in law got knocked up and had a baby. since I couldn't work when she gave birth, but I am not just yet, but out of resentment I don't want to watch the baby anymore. Would I be a horrible person to tell her I don't want to do it even though I still have time for it?

1347488225.0,zsfnu,Update from a few months ago. :),myheartishurting,167,24,29,"I just remembered I had a throwaway and I'd posted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/u7k1p/tell_me_what_to_do_reddit_i_am_desperate/) a couple months ago. I wanted to let you guys know how things are going!

At the beginning of July, him trying to repair things, him feeling like his actions were forced, me sensing that he was forcing himself to try to be happy with me, rinse and repeat. He attempted to break up with me. I convinced him that things could change and that he should give us another shot. He agreed. 

That was two months ago. Since then, that's just who he was. He started feeling more understood and appreciated after I stopped pushing him so hard, and little by little he became more affectionate and dedicated to us. I became happier because he was more affectionate, and was more loving towards him. He felt more loved, and reciprocated by texting me cute things and picking me up a little dog-shaped chocolate from our favorite candy shop one day before I came over.

The improvements show in the little things. Kissing my nose when we're lying in bed chatting. Coming up from behind me and hugging me while I'm baking brownies. Playfully leaving a post-it note on my forehead while I was asleep, without pushing or nagging from me, because he feels loved and appreciated and not pressured to be more expressive. 

I'm really happy, and that he really cares about me and is happy with me again. He has been behaving as enamored with me as he was at the beginning of our relationship, and I am so thrilled. Things are wonderful.

Thank you for the help. I couldn't have done this without a good hard reality check from some of you guys. We are on the up and up. :)

I have yet to see her in person.

This is what my weekend has consisted of thus far:

The 31st, the 2nd.  At around 10:30 PM, she called me to tell me she was sorry for being selfish and how she was acting.  Then she said she was keeping the baby and wanted to see me Tuesday, as she was too busy today (the 3rd).  This is when I told her that I'm having serious doubts about her claims and that she needs to come over and prove it to me.  She refused to come over last night, but said she would come over today (the 3rd).  She called me some names, to which I told her to stop and I tried explaining why I had my doubts.  She called me some more names, said it was a low blow, she told me she wasn't going to cancel the appointment now.  She didn't answer my call back.  I have asked her twice

The other things she accused me of on the phone was not talking to her more.  I told her that was stupid since she has been ignoring me completely.

I also explained to her that even if she is pregnant

I'm seriously hoping this shit gets over with soon and I know for sure one way or another.  She's been acting completely unreasonable

I have multiple auto-immune diseases that have resulted in significant hair loss, thus, extremely convincing.  I am not comfortable with not wearing a wig when in public, as I feel very humiliated and ashamed to be a woman with such significant hair loss, I have admittedly not accepted it.  There are times when my hair tends to grow back, but other times where it falls out in clumps.

I have been with a man for about a month's time who is wonderful and very kind.  He knows I have these conditions (he has celiac and issues with stomach ulcers, when he calls me beautiful, I can't help but feel like I'm lying to him, I feel like I should tell him that I wear this wig, but I am so afraid of how he will react, and how I will react as well.  I am extremely sensitive about my hair loss and talking about it makes me cry.  

I feel like I have to tell him eventually (obviously) but I don't know when the right time is.  I don't want him to be repulsed

-----

Several of you pointed out that his lack of interest in pegging or anal doesn't mean anything. I know you are right. When I said that

OK on to the outcome:

I cried most of the evening and was puffy and sniffling when he came home

Turns out I didn't have to say anything

He said he loved me and our life together and was extremely sorry for hurting me. He told me he wanted to discuss it after it happened

He said he tried again on Sunday, I ignored his attempts or said I had a splitting headache, and then went to my sister's place for the rest of the day). 

According to him, but had happened a few times in his past history with Tyler. 

The night it happened, and wouldn't have gone any further than what happened. He said he was completely wrong for choosing to do it, but that alcohol removed rational judgment from the process. If he was sober, he would have said ""sorry, I can't"" and left.

He says he is ""somewhat bisexual"" in that he's had passing attraction to some men but is predominantly sexually and romantically attracted to women. The last guy he felt any attraction towards was

He says that even though he has enjoyed hooking up with Tyler in the past

To all this, me stupidly assuming things are platonic between them, while she harbors attraction towards him and then when he gets drunk and she pushes just a little, he gives in. I can't just forgive this as a drunken mistake. It was dishonest not to tell me they had history and stupid to hang out in intimate situations.  It was totally fucked up to kiss him with so little prompting. If he can do this so easily, what's to say they haven't done this on other occasions? Or won't again?

He agreed and said it was wrong to keep it from me, prejudice, he didn't tell me. He feared I would never date him if I knew.

After a lot of emotional yelling and him trying to calm me down

When I asked

I just don't know where to go from here. I don't know if I believe that they haven't hooked up at other points during our relationship. I have no way of ever knowing that. I think ""is there still anything there"" is a pretty flimsy pre-text to throw away your obligations to be faithful and get carried away by kissing someone. Alcohol may have made that easier

I haven't made any firm decision yet. I'm still processing everything, thank you.

We have no physical contact. We barely speak. She frequently yells at me

To avoid her I've taken to staying up throughout the night and sleeping during the day. I spend about three hours a day cleaning up spills, she'll complain that she's a maid and I make her do all the cleaning while I sleep.

""Sex"" for us is her laying still on her back while I try to pleasure her and turn her on more. She's very into BDSM and complains that I don't bruise her; I'm afraid of going to jail if I do! Typically she'll ask me to rub her first before I go in then decides she is ready for bed without us having sex. I'm so frustrated by it I've lost the ability to orgasm even when browsing porn while she sleeps. She'll offer ""sex"" as a reward or lack of it as a punishment; our ""sex"" has become irrelevant to me and the only reason I am willing to do it is to keep her at yelling at me when I'm not in the mood. We started out having actual intercourse about once a week and now haven't even had ""sex"" in a month. Now that my mother is coming to stay with us for a week she's wanting to have nightly sex just to make my Mom feel uncomfortable and less likely to come visit.

Following the guideline

Right so it all started with a box of Ferrero Rocher and my complete lack of self control. After vowing to eat no more than 2

""AMBER CAN YOU GET ME A TOOTHPICK PLEASE?"".

Ladies and gentlemen

Now I feel it is important to stress that I am in no way in contact with my ex nor do I have any feelings whatsoever for her. And I can confidently say that because it's been that way for the last 4 bloody years! I can only assume it to be the actions of troll brain to ruin what was shaping up to be a very comfortable evening (Read: brain lapse). However try as I might

For the remainder of last night I thought it best to just let her be; which in hindsight mightn't have helped. Naturally I slept on the couch and woke up today with the sound of her leaving for work. (Forgive my naivety but I'm not entirely sure if her finding me sound asleep would have just fuelled the fire...ladies?) I returned from work this evening and tried to reach out to her then but I got the silent treatment. Told her I was making dinner and in turn got a deathly stare. But she did eat it so that's a good sign..right?! Since then she's gone to bed and I am typing this on my laptop on the couch.

Forgive the light heartedness with which I've written my dilemma; an approach I usually use in these situations. But I do love my girlfriend very dearly and I do miss her even though she's 30 feet away! We don't fight very often and I've certainly never been blanked before so I'm beginning to get a little worried. This is THE girl. The last thing I want to do is fuck things up but I'm not sure what to do. I'd very much appreciate it if anyone has any advice on how best to handle the situation. Thanks.


tl;dr Next time you go to ask your gf for toothpicks. Don't.

**[23:44 GMT] Edit 2: My apologies for the late update. Well in the morning she was behaving fairly normally but there was no mention of the incident. I thought it better at the time not to bring it up so we had breakfast and went to work. When I arrived home this evening I dropped myself next to her and the dam broke. She was visibly very upset and apologized for her reaction. As you suggested I did ask her if there was maybe something more to it but she didn’t know why she reacted so strongly. Although she did say my initial reaction didn’t help; which a few of you pointed out.**

**At that point I figured it would be best to get her out of the flat so I took her out to dinner. On the way there it dawned on me that we’d come across at least 2 name tags at the restaurant and “Oh god no...I couldn’t be that unlucky could I?!”. Luckily no one named Amber served us but I did learn that wasabi is actually rather hot. Afterwards she wanted to go to the cinema so I held my breath through a few more name tags and we saw The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo (really good movie actually).  We’re back at home now and unbeknown to her I’ve been up for about 36 hours so I’m about to crash harder than a parachuteless skydiver. On the bed this time though. Thank you again for all your advice

And I did. 

He refused to get a job during the first two months because he had no car, plus support him while he stayed home all day. So he begrudgingly started working for/with me. I own my own business, and have been running it alone for two years before he moved in with me. 

Working together was very bittersweet, I had been going through a trial and error for TWO YEARS, having tried many ways of doing things before deciding which ways were more efficient and cost effective. He was also very picky with what tasks he wanted to do, so in the end I would be left doing 60-70% of all of the work, while he did the remainder, and I have always been the one to pick up the slack, to do the numbers, to pay the bills

On a personal level, and he had a very hard time following their rules which in turn caused huge issues between my parents and I. 

At home, taking out all of his anger at me. He would break things, punch holes in the walls/doors, throw things, slam doors, yell very loudly, block me from trying to get away from him

To make things worse, the belongings that I have slowly accumulated. The life I have built for myself is in that house. I can no longer be with him, and I know that breaking up with him will be a trigger for him to go NUTS. When he gets mad, he enters a point of no return with blind rage where he doesn't care about anything or anyone. He will break anything or anyone without thinking twice. Also, he is very strong.... I don't know anyone that would win a physical fight against him. He also loves guns, and can get a gun from the streets with a single phone call and have it delivered within a half an hour. 

He knows where my parents live. He has a key to my business van, a very matriarchal figure, who is very supportive and wouldn't hesitate to save me with her life. I am absolutely petrified that if I tell him I am leaving him and I am going to stay with my mom, she will become his target. He is with me for life (wants children with me and everything) and has no idea that I am planning on leaving him. 

If he goes to prison, and therefore having to fend for himself. Then, every girlfriend he has had has cheated on him. 

Right now he has no car, I am just a sheep that cannot stand up for herself. 

I am out of the area right now and haven't talked to him in days. I am thinking that I will have to tell him that while I was away, to a very somber person who doesn't even smile anymore). Weeks ago, I told him that I am not well and I think I'm depressed. He just... shrugged it off. I'm thinking of telling him that I am suicidal and that I am being put on meds which will need to be heavily moderated by my parents. That my doctor told me I have to live with my parents for a few months, and that I can not have any contact with the outside world (outside of my job). My parents said I should leave him in the house with everything, pay all of the bills for a couple of months, and then tell him he will have to assume the responsibility of the cost of living in that house. They said I should say I will have to then start paying for my very expensive treatment and will not be able to support him. 

My parents told me that I should just leave him everything because my life is more important than my belongings... but now I am heartbroken because the hard work of my last six years is in there. All of my babies are in there. All of my keepsakes and memories are in there. 

How do I get out my personal belongings without him realizing that I'm never coming back? How do I play this game without him putting himself as martyr as he has done his whole life and continues to do? (He LOVES playing martyr and takes no responsibility for his actions). How do I get my cats out without him seeing it as alarming? Would it be believable if I took the things I want most and tell him that the doctor said I should have things that comfort me most around me? 

Where should I tell him? If I tell him at home, then are we supposed to ride in my car together on our way home? What am I supposed to do? How am I supposed to handle this? 
(For the record, but seeing as we have spent every second together since we got together, it is highly unlikely.)

1319211291.0,lk04f,Husband turned into a Cross-Dresser and I love him a LOT less.  Is it cruel or kinder to be honest?,thesparksagoner,156,16,105,"Married nearly 4 years

I always knew he had a kinky side and we bought a lot of sex toys together.  Shortly before we got married he revealed that (sorry if too much detail!) he liked to tie himself up when I was out of the house and he would use my vibrators anally.  I kind of got past that and didn't think too much about it.  

Last year he started heavily using drugs, and that he was buying himself sexy spike heeled boots off eBay and women's clothing all the time.  In ten years, he's never once bought ME sexy lingerie!  I asked him to tone it down, or just not do it while I was in the house, as I found it weird and uncomfortable being around him dressed like that.  You can't take a man seriously as a lover when you've seen him tottering around in stripper heels, wearing fake boobs that are ridiculously oversized and make him look like a clown with balloons stuck up its sweater, and he thinks he's HAWT.

Anyway, but then came back a little later and he was trying on another outfit.  I guess that was the point where I realised that he can't help himself, and it's not just a masturbation prop.  He is what he is.  And I lost all desire for him from that moment.  He's stopped doing drugs but the outfits and patent leather stripper heels are here to stay.  He keeps them out of my way, mostly, but... too late, the lust vanished in an instant.  I still can't believe how fast it went.

That was nearly nine months ago.  I spent the first three months very angry, and I spent the summer grieving for my old passion.  Every time I heard an Adele song on the radio, or saw an old photo of him as a younger guy, it would be really hard to hold back the tears and I pretty much cried all the time I was on my own, or wrote endless Reddit posts and never submitted them.  Then I went away for a few weeks, and when I realised I never thought of him sexually at all - and when I did, had a brief mental 'ew' reaction because I will always, it's dead and gone.  Now I feel nothing.  It's not personal.  I'm just really not attracted to cross dressers

Thing is, really missed me.  And to be selfish and honest, I really missed sex.  My sex drive is as high as ever, and physically, you know, it still feels good.  He just doesn't give me the spark anymore, and the part of sex that is mental and comes from being with someone you are really attracted to, is flat.  So I almost never come any more

Everything else is great.  We're good friends, I desperately don't.  But at the same time, for myself, I'm done being upset about it and now I really want some romance and to have sex again with somebody I desire.  It's left a giant hole in my life and I miss it.

I am heartbroken. I confront. He denies cheating but when asked specific questions such as ""So you're not even talking to other women?"", codependant streak in me and driving me absolutely bonkers. For some reason, I feel I NEED an explanation or apology SOMETHING! I don't understand what the hell is going on. How the hell does someone I have been so close to for 3 years do this, and then turn on me instead of even denying it? 

Further complicating things, soooo hurt. I know at my age the answers and the path should be clear, but its not. I feel powerless and betrayed and it's causing me to act in ways I don't like, but also am having a hard time controlling.

1366838674.0,1d1cnk,My mom [50] is threatening to disown me [f23] if I go on a trip that she thinks is unsafe.,guebjnjnlnppg,172,30,174,"Let me start by saying that I am financially independent of my parents (working ~70 miles away from their house, although I still go to them for life advice and value their opinions.

I have a very close relationship with my parents. I love them, and recognize how lucky I am, but as I get older, it's getting harder and harder to put up with their overprotective tendencies and their emotionally manipulative ways.

Here's the situation:

My friend invited me to go to SF with her and some friends for a couple of days, which puts us in SF pretty late at night. 

Now I've never been on a multi-day road trip with my friends before because my parents have never let me, a group of girls shouldn't be traveling alone unless there are at least 8 of them, etc.

When I first told them about the trip, reassuring them that I would be careful and that I would text them periodically to let them know where I am and what I'm doing.

And then, who is incredibly stubborn and quick to anger, started screaming at me. She said that if I really loved her, I wouldn't be making her worry. She said that if I were a good daughter, I would have told my friend that I wouldn't go in the first place because I knew my parents wouldn't feel comfortable with the night drive. She said that she's doing this for my own benefit, for my own safety. 

I explained that I'm not *trying* to hurt her or make her worry; I just think that she's overly concerned and really

My dad was a lot calmer during this conversation. Although I'm sure he doesn't feel the same degree of concern that my mom does about the night drive, I shouldn't go. There will be plenty of other trips in the future that I could go on. Throughout the conversation, my dad kept saying that he and my mom aren't trying to control me; gradually, as I get older and have more experience, my opinions will weigh more than their concerns.

I pointed out that this process still has to happen on their terms, of course it does. You have to keep in mind that we're your parents, and it's not easy for us to just let you go to do whatever. It has to be gradual. You may look at your friends and envy their independence, but you have to remember that every family is different. There are some things that they have that we don't have, and some things that we have that they don't have.""

I don't know how to get through to them. They can't keep using their concerns as a reason to get to be behave. And when I try to go against their wishes, and I hate myself for it. I feel pathetic and embarrassed and weak, and I don't know how much longer I can deal with this self-flagellation for not being to stand up for what I want. 

This is the first time my mom has ever threatened to disown me, I feel like she would make good on her threat, never giving in until I come around begging for forgiveness.

I can't live a life without my parents; it would tear me apart inside every day. But I don't think it's right for me to keep living my life on their terms. I don't want to be unfair to them; my parents didn't pick my major, etc., although I know that they didn't 100% agree with my choices in those areas. But even for small things like going on a vacation with friends, I don't think it's up to them to decide, and they can't seem to understand that.

I otherwise have a great relationship with my parents

I guess I'm just looking for some perspective. Have any of your parents disowned or threatened to disown you because they didn't like a decision you made? How did you handle it? Did you parents come around? I hate that I have to play Chicken with my mom

I'm not sure how much more context this will provide, grateful daughter is an obedient daughter. I recognize how ridiculous this is, but it's still really difficult to shake the mindset.

My wife mentioned she would like to spend Canadian Thanksgiving (October 8) with our mutual friends, as well as the usual parents and cousins are all coming together for Thanksgiving this year. I feel that the family would be very hurt if we didn't go. 

We talked about it tonight. I explained I thought that not going would really hurt me and the family. She replied that Thanksgiving should be 'ours' because we spend Christmas with 'my' family. I said that we don't have to spend every Thanksgiving with them, and have no resolution.

**UPDATE 2:** over 200 comments, for what that's worth. My plan is to try and approach this in a calm and supportive way, and suggest we compromise. Go to the cottage on Saturday, and come back Sunday or Monday morning (depending on out of towner's flights). Going forward, I'll propose we draw up a schedule for major holidays to try and minimize conflict. 

And for those that have been hard on my wife - she's really an amazing person. Every couple has issues that are sore spots between them. She's neither selfish nor controlling. If it seems that way it's because of the limited amount of info I've provided.

Wow. Where to start... It has been about six weeks since all of this began, each time with him being OVERLY nice, telling me he was going to do anything he could to help my daughter and me. Each time also resulted in the conversation ending with him in tears; I haven't been intentionally horrid to him, but I have a lot of anger and I don't try to hide it. He called again a day or two later and told me he wanted to explain his frame of mind when I had gone out to Oklahoma.

He said he doesn't know why he said or did any of the things he had done. He didn't understand it, although at this point, his little revelation had me baffled and confused. I have moved on. I let this die, let it go and found contentment and focus in my life without him. I'm actually starting to get out there a bit again (although I must say, after being with the same man for so long, all the attention is a little overwhelming, when its not inflating my ego). 

I asked him if he wanted us to be a family. He said yes and no, anything like this, ever again. He also admitted that this was about his deployment, but that he wouldn't be seeking any kind of help outside of talking to the chaplain, which helped solidify my personal justifications for going through with the divorce. I can't make him get help, and if he's refusing to do it, I will not be dragged down with him

He still denies he cheated

I moved out of his parent's house and into my friend's place with her kids, but I just can't afford that yet; at least I'm out of his parent's house.

When he had said all those horrible things to me in Oklahoma, my self image... Now that he's admitted this was an episode, and that the shit he pulled was just symptomatic, I've gained myself back. I knew he hadn't meant those things, but hearing him finally say it himself really helped me heal. 

We are trying to be amicable now. I don't really talk to him anymore, or anyone mentions the situation or asks how he's doing because I have this insatiable urge to say something passive aggressive. I don't, but I really want to.

It's been two weeks and he's rented an apartment in the village, he admitted that he does like me better the last couple of weeks, but he's not sure if I'm behaving differently because of the drugs or what. well, the medicine will apparently take about 4 weeks to work and it's just been 9 days so it's me that's changing. I've convinced him to wait before we try again, but right now I'm pretty angry with him. After 13 years I'm not willing to give up without trying, and I never thought he'd be willing to either. I've done everything in my power to make things right, and I think he's rushing into decisions

He's been here for the kids and we're doing a lot of stuff together still (we went to Iron Man 3-it was excellent!), and he's coming over today to play Settlers of Catan, we got him the seafarers expansion pack for his birthday. We talk everyday, and text each other about everything, last night we were talking about Game of Thrones. I suppose my question is, why on earth doesn't he want to try? Is he rushing into making decisions, or trying to take the easy way out? We're still best friends so I'm just feeling very confused right now.

So to get to where we are now, and she wasn't on birth control so its not a complete surprise this happened. She was going to see her doctor about getting on some form of BC, but this happened. Her first reaction was a smile, and I know she wants the baby. She tried to act poker-faced in front of me, but I know how she feels. She is excited. 

I want to be excited too, but I worry about her treating our baby different than my babies. I just don't feel like right now, keeping this baby is a great idea.

She loves kids, and has shown my children such love, and I don't think for a second she could forgive herself if she had an abortion. So we are stuck.

Fast forward to a year later, going to college and working full time while being pregnant and taking care of a toddler. He refused to move in together, saying that I was a lazy woman and that I didn't have the same goals and visions as he did.
During that time, said that he was sorry, and that it would never happen again. Our baby was born with issues that kept him in the NICU for nearly six weeks. During those six weeks, my husband rented an apartment and we moved in together with our oldest son while our baby recovered.
I was still going to school full time, he flipped out, interrupted me and never even let me talk or express myself.
Recently, we would need to seek counselling. He told me that he didn't even know if he wanted to work things out with me anymore.
He wants the house impeccably clean when he gets home from work, and he still expects me to work at least part time now and go to school full time. He doesn't want to spend any time with our sons. He gets pissed off when our baby cries and can't spend five minutes with him or his freaks out.
He constantly tells me that he wishes I dressed differently, started wearing my nice clothes and went to a lingerie party and got some stuff. I wore the sexy stuff one night and while we were having sex he told me that he couldn't even get off because he was so pissed at me for being a lazy ass.
I took a break from school just for the summer so I could spend some much needed time with my boys
He constantly puts me down, and he freaked, saying that all I wanted was to leave him and wasn't thinking of the welfare of our kids. I am so confused and so hurt.

And when we did talk she cursed me and called me every name in the book and I sometimes cursed at her (trust me, i regret it to this day and she still throws it in my face). I got tired of living off of my aunt who already had two kids of her own, so I attempted to try and be emancipated. I had a job and was going to get a lawyer and take her and my aunt to court about it, but as soon as I mentioned it to her she would get all sad and she moved in about a month after I mentioned taking her to court over my emancipation. 

She moves in

I tell her I CANNOT live with her anymore. I call my grandmother and ask her if she can come get me (she lives far away), and threatened to take anything else if I didn't give her my phone. I wasn't going. 

We later moved on past all of this &amp; she realized she was in the wrong. 

Now

My mom

She gets mad if I leave the house but when I offer to take her out she says

She is always saying fucked up shit to my sister and I. I just don't know if I can take it anymore. 

I could find someone to live with

Should I get emancipated? Do my mom &amp; I need counseling? I need advice

I'm currently in a 3 month relationship with a guy who's been separated for 1 year from a woman he'd been with for a total 6 years (she wanted the separation). They're very close - he considers her his best friend, lunches/dinners, car insurance, helps her with rent), etc. 

Other than the wife situation, etc. I tried to be open minded about his relationship with his wife, but now that I realize the extent of it all, I've begun to see him as 'damaged goods' in a way - he has way too much baggage for a guy his age, and I'm too young to even think about dealing with someone who's this close to his ex.

**There are two specific scenarios that illustrate my discomfort with the relationship:**


1) We were naked and enjoying some post-coital cuddling one night while he was over my place, but she brushed it off and said 'nevermind'. The fact that he would prioritize her over me shows that he's still not over her.


2) While he, and I were at a festival this weekend, I wanted to follow him home so we could have sex afterward (I had been looking forward to sexing him up all day). He said that it'd have to be a raincheck, because his wife was sleeping over on the top bunk of his bed.

...

So, I invited him to come along to the Sundance film festival with one of my film writer friends (along with several other people). I'm really looking forward to the trip - it's usually a blast, and my friend brings me along to some really cool interviews with moviestars and such. It would suck to have relationship issues put a damper on the whole thing.

My boyfriend sunk a decent amount of money into the trip ($1000, considering that I'm thinking about breaking up with him.

I was thinking about breaking up with him tonight. For the past couple days

**My question**: should I just suck it up for the next two weeks and break up with him after the vacation

Last night his family hosted a party at his house for our graduation (we're both seniors graduating from college today), and so I remembered that he fell asleep last night without setting an alarm.  Without wanting to wake him up, I grabbed his phone to set some alarms for him.  When I opened up his phone, I saw a picture of a girl's ass, and recognized it to be his roommate's sister (who was at the party last night).  I flipped to the next picture, and found another of another girl's ass in yoga pants, this time it was a girl I didn't know.  I started to shake violently, but he kept asking me what was wrong

What really hurts me about this is that this isn't the first time this has happened.  I was hanging out with my boyfriend about a year ago flipping through his phone pictures with him in the room (was not snooping, and he took them without them knowing.  The first time it totally broke me, I was so sad and I told him how disrespectful I felt those photos were, both to me and the other girl.  It messed up my own self-image and self-respect, and I felt conscious of my body and not good enough.  I forgave him.  But this just crosses the line for me.  I'm okay with watching porn, we watch it together sometimes.  But this second incident is too much, and it has left me more angry than sad.

What's worse, interacting and taking pictures with each other, and we might even all go to dinner together.  I don't know what to do.  I don't want to let this ruin my graduation.

I also don't know what to do when I talk to him about this.  I love him with all my heart, and I don't know where else to turn.

His Free Beer Club after work is destroying our marriage and I am throwing out my husband today to get in treatment or get a divorce, and will have to quit my job.",gattack,29, with no kids but we just decided to start trying.  We're both in our early 30s.  Our mutual boss took a personal interest in us shortly after my husband introduced me to his co-workers when we were first dating.  I was the only 'gal pal' of the guys there who would occasionally sit and drink a beer and shoot the shit with the guys after work (this was well before I worked there).  The boss got ordained to be able to personally marry us, and even helped the warehouse manager buy a house.  

The boss offered me a better-paying job about 8 months into our (already rocky) marriage, so it's not really like we're working together.

In the beginning, initially. One more reason the boss was awesome!!  Not everyone would stay either.  Once I started working there I would stay maybe once every week or two, but they smoke in the warehouse after hours and I can't tolerate indoor smoke. 

Then, with the guys in back able to stay and drink on the boss' dime for as long as they wanted, with the boss constantly pushing 'just one more' down their throats.  And this happens *every night of the week.*

Now all the warehouse employees (my husband included) drive home well over the legal alcohol limit every night.  My husband comes from a heavily alcoholic family and had problems even before his boss entered the picture.  I never see my husband sober

All of this is on top of us already being separated last fall for 3 months, and got my own room in a house for another month before he calmed down and we worked things out.  He submitted to an alcoholic assessment while I was at the shelter and was told he should do out-patient treatment for alcoholism.  Everyone I know who has sobered up has said that out-patient programs are worthless if you really want to sober up - and they were right.  My husband tried it for a week and quit because ""it was too expensive.""  He went right back to drinking after work.  

As an alcoholic, he is destroying the marriage he helped put together.  He is a traditional, conservative Republican (my husband had to hide from the company that he voted for Obama), and supports his Russian wife, who has never worked a day in her life and puts up with any bullshit from him because he is rich.  I feel this example creeping into my husband's idea of how marriage and being a husband is supposed to work, and it terrifies me.  The boss is never home, ignores his wife, and pushes the idea that the women are just trying to take their beer away

Fast forward to last night.  My husband didn't come home until 8:30pm, but it's been a long time since he bothered. Most nights he doesn't even bother apologizing or excusing his lateness.  He picked a fight and put down my choices for how I want to give birth, refusing to read the info on the birthing center I've been looking at for a year, saying it was dumb.  Then he passed out on the couch after not even being home an hour, without helping me clean up the apartment for a friend who's staying tonight, as he promised he would.  Because he is a drunk.  Drunks cannot accomplish things even they want to accomplish.

I hit the breaking point.  I told him while he was passed out that it was officially a mistake for me to have come back to him.  I packed him a bag, so he can crash there indefinitely as far as I'm concerned. 

I'm at work right now writing this, and text him after I leave to check his email.  My ultimatum:  30-day inpatient treatment or your marriage.  Don't call me until you're sober.

Obviously, what should the message be?  I can't in good conscience continue to work for a company whose policies are actively eroding my marriage, especially when I am about to toss my husband out.  I may have a work-from-home option temporarily, because I handle their eBay sales and most of that I can do off-site.  But not permanently, and there is no way any of this is going to go down nicely.

I'm calm but frantic.  This is a huge decision and I need your support Reddit.  (BTW my husband, which I manage completely as he is godawful with money.  I can't really afford a lawyer, and honestly I think if he were to sober up we would have a real chance at making our marriage work.  Big IF though.

**TL;DR - The title sums it up.  Otherwise awesome boss is ruining my marriage by manipulating my already alcoholic husband with free beer so he can have drinking buddies

Thank you all for your replies. Unless I overlooked a post not a single person has thought I should continue dating her. She promises that she won't whore herself out and swears she was just stressed out afraid of losing her job. I believe her.

What continues to bother me is that this morning it took us another hour of arguing before she apologized for last night. Instead of apologizing for arguing that she should be allowed to disrespect the sanctity of our relationship she repeatedly side-stepped the apology. She kept either changing the subject to a different part of the argument, knew she had problems going into the relationship, and she is seeing a therapist so I would feel rather amoral abandoning her. I know breaking up with her seems like such an obvious answer, but she obviously has emotional problems. Doesn't that mean she should be allowed some slack?

**e1;tl;dr: She promises she won't whore herself out yet refuses to apologize.**

Edit 2:
I guess in the end I have to decide which is greater: the pain of breaking up with my girlfriend or the probability I'd find out multiplied by the pain I'd feel if she prostituted herself plus the probability I'd catch an STD from her multiplied by the pain I'd feel if I caught an STD.

**e2;tl;dr: [Breakup Pain] vs [(probability I find out)(pain of finding out)+(probability of catching an STD *from her*)(pain of catching an STD)]**

Edit Final:
It appears *everybody* who commented was unanimously in favor of my breaking up with her. I'm not blindly following anybody's advice, but so did the Bay of Pigs beach invasion. The only things left to do are a lot of heavy thinking and talking things over with her then we'll see if the relationship can continue.

I cried and he talked, then the marriage was over, but if he did feel guilty, then we could work it out. He said he didn't want to throw our relationship out and looking to cheat would be a way for him to figure out whether he wanted to stay with me or not. 

I was blown away that he thought cheating was a viable option, that it was too raw and we both needed to organize our thoughts before discussing it, but he kept digging and digging.

**tl;dr**: girlfriend is emotionally less than stable and uses feelings as an over-ruling argument tactic

These are both traits that I am working to fix and realize I cannot invalidate her feelings because I want to be correct. I still have a lot to learn thanks reddit for the help!

He is kind of a dick to his wife. We've heard him yell at her and scream and call her names in the background and his wife has told my wife some pretty insane stories. Obviously two sides to every story but his wife's version of events make him seem really controlling and borderline abusive. 

That isn't the only thing. This part I haven't told my wife since if I did she would probably tell his wife and it would explode from there. Ajay has had multiple affairs that I know of. He doesn't really deny them. He had a thing for a few months with a coworker of mine. I know this for a fact. I've seen him hit on women when we are alone and he doesn't really act the part of a faithful husband. I'm not interested in ratting him out or interfering in his marriage but I do feel scummy by association. 

He is a good friend of mine though and he is really loyal and helpful. So those would be the reasons to not cut off contact. We can talk for hours and we have a lot in common. I'm not sure if I'd be able to find another guy friend like him. We are also really connected as families so it would be tough to break off contact.

[Update 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1a5c5u/update_being_sued_by_my_f30_cheating_exbf_m30_i/)

Some of you asked for an update on this post I made about a month ago regarding an ex boyfriend who forced me to sign a contract under duress for his debts accrued and gifts given whist co-habiting

1) Him being unemployed and my paying for his existence (rent
2) Him walking out after I found him cheating and
3) Not paying a penny towards the remainder of the lease

The final hearing was today. I prepared substantial proof as to why the contract was signed under duress but the judge said it was just contention due to the end of the relationship. I logically argued my case for two hours but the judge wasn't really interested in anything I had to say, that was the end of the matter.

The final amount is £3749 to be paid within 14 days. The judge was just impossible. I was very explicit about mental health difficulties and was armed with medical reports but I think she thought that depression and anxiety are a made up condition.

I am cross and hurt

I was so generous to this guy

I do have the right to appeal but to be honest I don't think I have the heart or energy. This has taken the wind out of my sails and I never want to see him again. I think I want to suck up the cost of my mistake. I have learned a valuable lesson about generosity

Is there anyway to fix this?,throwaway12345678906,167,33,66,"I should preface this by saying I haven't really discussed this with him. It is out in the open that there are issues with our sex life- he knows I don't give him enough... and I admit it. We have sex pretty much once or twice a week. The longest in our entire relationship we have gone without sex has been 2 weeks but this is not enough for him.

 I am a full-time university student and work 20 hours a week on top of my studying. I am often very busy

I could just give him more sex and not be into it.. but I tried that before and it just made it so I was never horny myself

What makes it harder is that for some reason he cannot reach orgasm in a ""normal"" time frame. I know every time we start fooling around I am committing to a good hour (maybe more) of sex. Our ""quickies""
I get bored or tired or sore after a good hour of sex and I ultimately have to resort to role playing out his fantasies in order to end it. This happens every time. I used to love indulging him in these

I love him. So much. We have an excellent rapport and we get along so great. We have been talking about marriage and children. I want to keep him. I want to make him happy.

The rest of the money that was awarded was put away for me to access when I turned 18. 

Ever since, on Thanksgiving, she flipped her SUV while driving drunk. She was unhurt but the car was totaled. That day she quit drinking, and to my knowledge, hasn't drank since. She still chain-smokes, though. 

When I turned 18, or if she was from then on unqualified without me as a minor dependent.

I bought her a used vehicle from her brother, as well.  

Today, if my boyfriend [20, been together 4 years] and I both have steady jobs. At this point, we're still looking. We both got laid off in the winter when our retail company's branch shut down. We both have promising interviews (his is for a management position) this month, though, and are keeping an eye on our options. 

Thing is, but it's a horse-to-water situation. She won't help herself by going to therapy, which was free, or seeing any doctors. She talks about finding a job, and has connections through friends, but won't even fill out an application. She has nothing medical holding her back from working, which I noticed when she did community service following her drunk driving accident. 

I love my mom so, especially lately, but when we have a good day, it's great, and I feel terrible for wanting to leave her. She uses this to her advantage. 

I want to move closer into the town where I'll be working and going to school, and learn to respect money and live within our means as much as we can. I want my mother to be independent again, and find happiness and normality. 

I feel terrible at the thought of abandoning her. I would be a horrible daughter and would probably just be dumping her on her brother, but I refuse to move out and pay rent for two homes. I fear what my family will think of me if I leave, but I feel like the only way my mom will get on her feet is if I'm no longer there as her crutches.

1375720062.0,1jqxgl,My cousin's husband [37M] was drunk and flirting with me [26F] should I tell her?,throwaway100100101,184,57,91,"I'm seriously trying to keep this as short as possible while giving all the facts so I know any responses I get are as informed as possible. 

At a very recent family party where heavy drinking occurred (party of &lt;20 finished a keg and plenty of vodka bottles), they're all enabling each other's drinking, and they have little to no communication skills. My parents' have been divorced for &gt;17 years because of the drinking; I've been estranged from this side of the family before, I don't see them all the time, usually at parties they throw for birthdays or holidays.

My cousin, and has given me very honest and tough advice when I was breaking off an engagement-- came to the party at her brother, Mike's [30M] home, with her three kids [~8M,6F,4F], husband James and her mother (who lives in the other part of a mother-daughter style home). 

Here's a brief history of their relationship/his qualities: They have been through a lot (~15 years married, is very nice and sociable (definitely has the gift of gab); He suffers from manic-depression (or so they say), self medicates, goes out almost every night to his friends' houses. He leaves to go out when Arielle gets home from work until 1-2 am, plays softball once or twice a week and self-medicates with weed, alcohol and probably more. He's prescribed anti-depressants or anti-psychotics but I'm not sure he takes them. She works full time and is basically supporting the entire household on a salary that really can't. He works on and off, here and there, despite him being there at the same time as he doesn't interact with his own children. If he watches the kids it's him sitting on the couch

In their past: ~9 years ago James cheated on her with a young woman who was a friend of his friend, and to which she responded by kicking him out and going through a hard break-up/separation period. James went ahead, slept with the young woman and Arielle was devastated and heartbroken. Fast forward: During a reconciliation period shortly after, she found out she was pregnant with his child. She brought him back into her home, but she has never been the same. She tells me that he killed her innocence and made her into a different person because of that affair. In total they have three kids together. She may have forgiven him but she doesn't forget. 

At this family party: I overheard James giving marital advice telling another member of my family who is recently engaged ""Marriage is so hard
In the late afternoon: Arielle left James at the party (which happens at almost every party), no i can't you dick. 

By the end of the night I was one of the last 6 people there. I had previously agreed to drive James home after my cousin left, and more or less saw him as a guy who, despite said problems, would be working hard to change his life and turn things around for himself and his family. I gave him the benefit of the doubt for all this time, thinking that if Arielle wanted to stay with him, that's her choice and she knows him better than I do. If they were staying together, that she would have good reason. Like I said, and he was the worst. Hammered. Sloshed. A wreck. But honestly

During the night's last beer pong match he stumbled backward into the pool, but why would he--seeing as its my cousin who will pay for a new one, not him. He was so drunk and immediately wanted to lie about it to Arielle, claiming someone pushed him and ""That's the story I'm going with"". 

During the evening as the drunkenness progressed James began saying creeeeepy things to me. I got choked up, revolted and so shocked that he'd ever think it was okay to say inappropriate things to me, his wife's cousin. I did nothing to provoke this behavior, I assure you I was not being flirtatious in anyway. I have never seen him that way, and never will. I trusted him. He was almost an uncle-figure. Here's what he said: Followed by my response.

- ""Stop being so cute"": I didn't respond

- In the middle of a conversation I was having with him and two other men (My male cousin, Carlos), he smacked my ass. The 2 other guys didn't react, so I didn't either. Tried to ignore it.

- ""My wife wants me to live my life however I wish"": I didn't respond.

- ""You've always been trouble, I haven't. I don't know what you're talking about.

- ""There was that one time....We had our moment."" : There was no moment

- ""You've always been chasing after me

- ""Where were you when I was growing up?"" : Not born yet.

- ""There's something I want to tell you

I approached Mike alone to tell him James was saying the most disgusting things to me and I'm incredibly uncomfortable. I'd never back out of being a DD for someone but that I don't feel comfortable being alone with him. 
Mike told me ""This is how he gets, one time and was kicked out of their home. He accused Harriet of making out with him"". I told Mike that I don't want to be in that situation where accusations can be made or behavior like that will happen.
I asked if I could take Carlos with me, we briefed Carlos on what was going on and told James that Carlos had to go to 711 and I was bringing him. 

When we left James sat in the passenger seat and for the entire car ride James was trying every way possible to convince me to go to the closest 711, then back. I claimed to be making a big circle around and that he was getting dropped off first. James didn't buy it and was none too happy, he said ""This is not how it was supposed to be"" to which I didn't respond. The remainder of the car ride was in silence. We got to his house, I didn't say goodbye as Carlos opened the door to help James out. I pretended to be busy in my purse to avoid any further contact with James and didn't notice as he came around to the driver side, knocked on my window then walked away. I brought Carlos back to Mike's house and vented the entire time. Carlos also corroborated the stories of James flirting and hitting on women and his creepiness when drinking. I've never seen James like this, I had no idea anything like this had already happened, let alone there was a strong track record of this behavior.

In my hurry to leave Mike's house I forgot my bathing suit and dishes so the next morning I went back to pick them up, he lives there, they have a long history. You telling her isn't going to make anything better, just cause unnecessary drama. She will just look at him like a bigger asshole. I can only tell you I support you entirely,and understand your feelings but you're an adult and can do what you want. It will make you feel better getting it off your chest, but it won't help her any. And it's not like he would have done anything."" 
I rebutted ""I've been around creeps before, and said it would be between us, he would have taken it. And furthermore, no matter how drunk I ever got, I know I would never, ever hit on my cousin. Never. And James crossed those lines."" We left the conversation in disagreement but I thanked him for his opinion.

Obviously its harder to tell Arielle than it is to sweep it all under the rug, this is why it's so upsetting. I've been hit on before, but not by a family member, and never asked to keep it a secret. 

This is all going on, my family is basically protecting him and making an environment conducive to this, how is this looking out for her? Mike advised me to confront him about what happened, give him a chance to apologize but only when Arielle isn't around. I don't wish to ever speak to him again, and being alone with him is out of the question. I will never trust him again.

Drunk or otherwise, our family, any social or familial boundaries and I will NEVER look at him the same. I would want to know if my husband acted like this, I wouldn't want to be in the dark with the wool pulled over my eyes. I would want and expect my family to have my back and show me that by being honest, no matter how difficult it may be for them.  I love my cousin Arielle so much, and she's given me plenty of tough advice others could not. I believe we've always had an honesty policy between us and by not telling her I'm going back on that. Am I the only one who feels this way? Would you want to know your husband acts like this on the regular? Should I tell Arielle?

It all started about 4 months ago when she met someone at a party and starting chatting with him online.  She started talking to me about it because I had once fallen in love with someone I started talking to online. I noticed that she kept insisting that it was nothing serious because it was 'just an online thing'. In my experience though

Fast forward a few weeks later and they're secretly meeting up. She kept on telling me that it was a mere fling and no real emotions were attached

A few weeks later though, this time she wasn't telling me personally, she was telling my other sister all the details, who then told me. After the first guy I had rather explicitly shown my disapproval of her actions and I assume thats the reason why she's not longer telling me anything. So my sister tells me she's been seeing this guy pretty often, and each time she said she was meeting up with her girlfriend, it was in fact this guy. 

Everyone in my family knows about this. The other day my other sister called to confirm that a friend of a friend had seen my sister with this new fling at a party, but at the same time I could not, ever, betray my sister in any way. I know that I'm not doing anyone a favor by just shutting up and sitting around feeling miserable, but I feel that whatever I choose to do will end up very shitty. The thought of my sister breaking down makes me extremely upset too, even though I'm very well aware of the fact that she's been doing this to herself, and to all of us as well indirectly. We're all lying to her boyfriend, we're also not telling our sister we know. 

My head is kind of in a haze now, so I'm terrified of giving away too much information. However, as a frequent r/relationships visitor I know how important it is to give a good view on whats been going on in order to receive some advice.

I'll try to sum it up in a tldr.

TL;DR: Sister is cheating on boyfriend


EDIT: To everyone saying its none of my business: I agree entirely. However


EDIT 2: Thank you r/relationships for all the replies. I just texted my sister asking if she wants to have dinner tonight, I didn't really ask her for permission. But its obvious, as many of you have pointed out, that waiting even longer is definitely not going to help anyone. I'm also afraid my sister will react very upset and might deny things or even blame me for her actions, I have no clue. But I don't care anymore, I'll make a small list with things to point out that I know if she throws me off guard. Thanks again for all your help and (mostly) kind words. I'll update as soon as I get the chance. ",,,,

Alright
I was in an abusive relationship (physically, I've received counseling (still am) and I've gotten much self worth back... Life is good.
Now, have been together 9 months, and love each other very much.  However, I still do things that make him feel like he's not being a good boyfriend, which he totally is.  I cry over little things, flinch when he goes to hug me, and obsessively worry about being cheated on even though since the day we met, and sometimes we talk about it and he's completely supportive and understanding of these habits.  But I know it makes him feel bad and worry.
Sorry for the vagueness but...what can I do to show him that I DO trust him and love him

I'll be honest and say I didn't want to break up with him despite that was the general consensus. Unfortunately it worked out that way regardless. I'm extremely sad right now

I brought the issues up in the previous thread with him and we finally talked to the bottom of it. I guess in retrospect, it wasn't. 

It came down to our relationship being too serious for him. He just wants to go out there and have his fun

She's told me a day but hasn't confirmed the time or location.  Last I heard

Quick backstory: I'm a 23 year old male that recently went through a very tough breakup.  I did what most men my age would do: I rebounded with the first attractive girl to show interest in me.  I guess the length of this ""relationship"" has been about 3 or 4 weeks.

Now I'm in the dilemma of having to deal with a pregnancy with a girl I don't have romantic feelings with.  To make matters worse

She told me at about 4:30 AM

She says she found out because she was feeling sick yesterday so she went to the doctor and they ran blood work.  This

What makes me distrust her most is she has a boyfriend and hasn't been honest with me about it.  I found out on her Facebook that she was seeing a guy and calling him her boyfriend and he was calling her his girlfriend.  When I asked her who he was

The other odd thing is that I immediately talked to my older sister about it.  I am currently living with my sister and she's been nothing but supportive of me during the past few (rough) months.  FWB was pissed that I told my sister.  My sister also thinks the situation and her reactions are strange.

The advice I'm looking for is how to approach this subject.  If she really is pregnant, this is the position she would want me in.

Right now I'm telling her I want to attend her next doctor's appointment.  As soon as I told her this

She has also said things like ""Oh

Most of this has taken place within the past 3 hours and is a lot for me to process.  I'm trying very hard to be rational about my thoughts and I'm certain that I'm not thinking this solely because I do not want a child.

Thank you for the time it takes to read this.  I know it's not 100% coherent so if you need clarification

I want them to be happy but it hurts like hell.,iamathrowawaytoday9,172,41,54,"Context details: I am a girl. Everyone in this story is a senior in college (about to graduate). We all work in the same tight-knit artistic industry. This is a throwaway on the off chance someone is a redditor.

One of my best friends, I developed feelings for him. I told him when it was convenient (we didn't have any major projects on deck, it was summer, I was leaving the city for the summer). I kissed him and waited. He doesn't return my feelings and, at this point, never will -- he's had plenty of excellent chances. I am in love with him, but am at an okay place with it. He's one of the most important people in my life and I know I mean a great deal to him. I was 90% at peace with this.

Enter my roommate, and honest people I know. She used to be part of a separate group of friends but this year I introduced her to my friends, including D, and now we're all part of the same circle.

I've noticed L and D getting close recently but didn't really think much of it. L is awesome

At a party this past weekend, etc.... I heard that they did actually make out but only from other drunk people, so unconfirmed. The owner of the apartment is another friend of mine, and as the party ended he decided to let the trashed people sleep there. I helped him move everyone to sleeping surfaces. L and D were passed out together on a couch and I willingly put them in a bed together. Nothing happened -- they slept through the night.

When we got home the next day, told L that if she's interested in D, she should go for it. He will never love me like I love him. And I want him to be happy.

Her response: ""Oh

I joked that it's going to happen on a trip a group of us are taking together this summer to my hometown. She didn't return the joke

She insists she'd never want to hurt me like that. But that's also kind of an admission of feelings for D (if she didn't have feelings for him

I love L and I love D as friends. If D won't be with me

But today, like most of our friends, has NO IDEA of my feelings for D -- IMed me on Facebook asking how long L and D have been dating, and when I said ""hahahaha they aren't"" joked about them eyefucking each other.... and also mentioned that they'll probably hook up on that trip we're all taking. If it hadn't been over text, I wouldn't have been able to pretend everything was okay, and funny, and sweet.

How the fuck do I deal with this. I don't want to be a jerk and stop the nascent relationship. If there was any chance I could get with D

But how do I deal? What can I tell them

**TL;DR unrequited love of three years and roommate want to bone each other. are holding back out of respect to me. how do i give them the okay while minimizing hurt to me.**

**EDIT:** Wow, for taking time to argue with each other (and me!), and your well wishes. The term ""love martyr"" is pretty powerful and I'm seeing I have quite a few shades of that.

1370986836.0,1g5gtr,Update 2 and another question: I'm (24f) about to take custody of a friend's (30f) three kids while she enters rehab.,marshmallowsbunny,174,43,48,"Hello again. I really don't want to rehash everything so here is a [link](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/19ol29/im_24f_about_to_take_custody_of_a_friends_30f/) to how I actually got in this situation and why I took the kids.

Also [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1bpttx/update_im_24f_about_to_take_custody_of_a_friends/) is my second update.

Basically my friend got caught drinking and driving with her kids. To get the child endangerment chargers dropped from a felony to a misdemeanor she when into rehab. Technically she went to voluntary rehab with the understanding from the court that if she left they would keep it a felony if she did not they would reconsider. It was not technically mandated so I thought I should clear that up so the timeline makes more sense to everyone.

She did well in her program and was able to leave two weeks ago with an understanding that she was in a transitional period. She had to get urine checks

I've been living in her house and taking care of her three kids, M6. Now we are both at the house. I still have custody of them until Friday and was told that if I contacted the judge with concerns he would extend it until August.

I'll be blunt. Both of us being there is hard. She wants to jump right back into mother role and gets upset that the kids come to me with questions or concerns. She has never said anything in front of them

I had some very choice words with her. I told her she had to give this shit up. I threw it in her face that her kids were depending on me since they didn't feel they could depend on her. I got harsh and a little bitter. I never threatened to keep her kids but we both know I can. We had another conversation the next day and she made positive changes such as switching to an addiction therapist in addition to the program and cutting off all contact with her ex. She's been great for the last week and a half. The kids are very slowly starting to transition back to her. Social services is checking in once a week. She's getting tested every day...

But now I'm stuck and lost. I feel selfish. I took the kids for the 90 days and now I'm tired and drained. I'm a teacher who finished the school year with 3 children who are not mine. Most of my friends vanished after the novelty wore off and the one who did make a few offers I didn't really want to call since she is not a big kid person. I want my life back. I want to go see my family 7 hours away, and I want to be there...

But I made a commitment to these kids. I don't know if I feel comfortable giving them back on Friday. If I keep them I risk pissing off their mom. She could cut me out of their lives when she does get custody back. She will be furious if I don't sign the papers Friday. It would be so much easier for me to. I could have my life back, I really don't know if there is anything that could. I don't like the idea because she has already messed up. What do I do? Do I keep them until August? Give them up Friday? I'm torn between being selfish and making sure they are really safe. I'm more tired and broken down then I've ever been in my life, but at least I know I will not be drinking while I have them in my care. Please, give me something. I love them but I just don't know what the right answer is. Sorry this is fragmented. I'm too emotional right now.

Hey everyone

I have never read anyone else's phone before without their express permission

Disgusted as I am with my breach of her privacy

I found a message talking about how they wanted to fuck (very descriptive).

I found a message talking about how horny he was after seeing her.

I found a message talking about how good each of them were at kissing.

I found pictures sent between them of them hugging (him hugging her from behind

I saw a picture of a ring that he gave to her (that I never found out about).

I saw a message she sent to another friend talking about how he wasnt yet ready for a full relationship

So this has validated my fears and I wont be putting up with this anymore. If there is anyone who commented on my previous post chances are you have been validated completely and you were right.

Some romantic; some strictly sexual. She is still *""friends""* with almost all
 
Logically, she admits that if I were best friends with my former sexual partners (women), she would be uncomfortable. But again she insists that because her friends are female it is not the same thing.
 
My hypothetical concern: In the event of a shared argument or disagreement, I've seen a lot of romantic comedies (perhaps not the best litmus test of reality), but my concern is her *""friends""* could easily take advantage of her vulnerability. Taking into full consideration their previous shared sexual intimacy: 1) it indicates a previous attraction/sexualized intent/motivation on their part (as well as hers). 2) They are not a neutral party 3) She's already had sex with them!

I understand this concern screams of my personal insecurities. I understand that it is not appropriate for me to ask her to stop speaking with her bestfriends. Nonetheless

However, so I believed him completely. 

I asked my boyfriend later if he would actually leave me if this other girl wanted a relationship with him. He beat around the bush for an hour or so

I told my boyfriend that I didn't want to be in a relationship with someone who was in love with another woman. So

After sitting on this awhile

He has been calling and texting me non-stop. I haven't answered his calls or messages. All his texts and calls are him saying things like ""She wouldn't even get with me anyway

I'm on the fence if I should talk to him again

**MY QUESTION FOR YOU** Should I respond to his messages? Was I unfair for leaving him? Was I too rash to leave the way I did? Do you think I am overreacting? Should I set up a date to talk and hear him out? Should I work through this and take him back?

The problem is this: From 2005-2008, all manner of sexually explicit material was exchanged. This includes pictures, videos and phone sex. I tolerated it for so many years because I love my wife and children, but it slowly killed me inside every day it continued.

About six weeks ago, her WoW playing is cutting into our family time. She has lied to him (just like before) and tells him we are divorced because the only way he’ll be friends with her is on cyber BF/GF terms. She tells me I am being ridiculous, and they will never meet, but I am unwilling to go through this all again.

Furthermore, he actually BOUGHT A PLANE TICKET, before she finally told him “No, you can’t come here.” Needless to say, he was as devastated as I was elated. Now she’s just doing it all over again. She says she is lonely, and I believe her, but I honestly do not know how much longer I can go on like this.

Divorce is so final, and she’s living in fantasy land with some Australian who is 10 years her junior. 

Is it time for me to cut my losses and get out

**EDIT** -- Thank you all for your wonderful, I had her read this thread.  She acknowledges that what she is doing is wrong, but is reluctant to give it up.  I have given her a week to come clean with him about the fact that she's still married (although it didn't stop this idiot before), or I will tell him myself.  I hope it doesn't come to that.  Furthermore, if she hasn't ceased all contact within a month and attended counseling with me, I WILL be leaving for good.  The choice is hers.  I am not optimistic based on her history, but it's the only shot we've got.  This would be much easier if I hated her guts, I cannot allow things to continue this way.  I am not blameless in this,,

Most of our friends are queer



About 8 months ago, successful, intelligent, laid-back, young lady: J. T and J become fast friends. I encouraged their relationship, as I could see that J was a good person and had much to add to our lives. Over the course of a couple of months, they began spending every free moment together, as I expected, love, we are husband and wife now



And then sex. And drinking. And more sex. And whispers of polyamory. And drugs. And sex. And then a slow decent into despair... because of course



Now, and never liked boyz at all. She has informed her family, our friends, and me, of her knew life. I haven't told a soul. She was literally, absolutely everything to me. I existed every single day for her well being first, and then my own. Always. Every single move I have made with my life was made with her happiness first and foremost in my thoughts. She was, my only friend.



I kept up a friendship with her for a little while, because I am pathetic and desperate and I want her back with everything that I am. She was still telling me that she needed me in her life and that she didn't want to get a divorce, but that she just wanted to be with her... now. How the fuck am I supposed to deal with that? I found out one day that she was just using me, for a ride to the store of all the banal fucking things, rather than needing to still see me, or desiring of my company, or wanting to talk. After that I broke off all contact and started drinking.



So my question? I don't know... how do I not drive my car into a wall? What the fuck do people do all day long? How do people sleep alone at night? How do I get her back? Should I get her back? Is it not wrong for me to be so hurt that she has discovered her true self and is trying to be happy? Should I talk to her? How do I not talk to her? I literally do nothing but think about her or distract myself from thinking of her; how do I handle this constant ache and obsession? How does one just, right guys?

My problem is that I'm always sick when I eat vegan. Sick as in my stomach hurts all day and I have explosive diarrhea. And if I make the mistake of eating grains or beans

I'm the kind of guy who's very rational and wouldn't make a choice about his diet without dissecting the science behind it and right now it doesn't look too good for the vegan diet. Sure it's healthier than the american standard diet

I don't know what I should do about this. I don't like being forced into a lifestyle that I did not choose out of my own free will and that I don't believe in, they have no problems.

I talked to her. See update thread above please.
-----------------------------
Situation:

Me [M31] - Never married, good education, good job, etc.

She lives in a different country 1000 km apart
 
She [F30] - 8 year old son, living off her ex-bf's (father of her son) money, emotionally unstable.



Ok

I searched /r/AskReddit

This post is hard for me to write and I do not easily turn to The Internet to advice me in such personal problems


My girlfriend and I have been together for about 6 months. We met online and we have visited eachother 4 times
We keep daily contact through Skype and WhatsApp.



We do want a serious relationship

This will require both of us to get a job. She would work 50% and I would work 100%.
She is reluctant to comply because she wants financial reassurance first. I will take any job I can as long as it covers the bills
She requested me to transfer money to her first



I am reluctant to fork over money
She tells me ""her heart and mind do not communicate"" and that it's hard for her to feel



I accepted that she is not so affectionate towards me because of the medicine and her emotional scars/trust issues

FYI: the sex is awesome, that sorta thing. 
Can the anti-depressants really be blamed for lack of that behaviour?


She also seems selfish at times. I know she got spoiled by her father and ex-boyfriend
I told her I will not be able to do that. I make good money


She doesn't seem to care much about my personal needs. Example: She wakes up very late (13:00-15:00) while I wake up 09:00-10:00.

This is due to the medicine and low iron-level in her blood she says. The rest of the day then proceeds to do whatever she plans/wants to do
In the hours she sleeps, do groceries, play with her son, make his breakfast, that sorta stuff. 


She just seems to take everything for granted. I feel like doing all these things are a huge accomplishment for me
I expect some excitement and/or praise from her


When she wants something
When I try to put myself in her shoes, like she said she was.
Again

I bring her gifts from my country, she waits in the car outside and acts like I just came home from daily groceries when I give her a gift.
I want to be welcomed with open arms after not seeing eachother for a month


She always hides behind the medicines for being the cause of her giving me the cold shoulder and that her son's wellbeing is her #1 priority


She says she loves me, everything. But her actions tell me otherwise.

I know she had a very rough life so far


Please tell me I'm a whiny bitch


**TL;DR - GF doesn't want to give up her easy life and refuses to show me affection until I show her a better life. Love first money later? Or money first

edit. Gotta say I can't believe how supportive people have been here. Thank you

**1. The big picture and what I think set everything off**

Honestly

she took this very seriously. She built a paranoia, she is always mindful of everything I do.


**2. The day by day**

She is angry ALL THE TIME. She didn't go to school this summer

 At this point I think **she is not healthy. (She even is badly underweight)** There has to be something wrong with her. All she does is destructive

She doesn't have a penny but what I've given her. Yet she says she is leaving. She doesn't have a car

**3. my greatest concern** 

My point is that never in my life I've seen that kind of decision making. Last night I got home at 3 frustrated because something didn't work out for me. she wanted to argue but I asked her for space

She was asking ""Are we getting divorced? Are we getting divorced?"". I sighted and looked away on my computer.
Finally she said "" I'm moving out at the end of the month"". I was baffled because it is very much impossible unless she does a backpack move out.
I just said "" if that is what you want


**tl;dr**: My wife seems completely insane. She is always angry, and her extreme insecurity... It was impossible for me to make her see a psychotherapist rather than a counselor.

And she now told me she wants to move out. We live in a 1 bedroom apt. I don't know how to feel since we share and breath the tiny space
She told me she is moving out but in reality she has nothing so I worry about her. I honestly believe she is not making decisions on her right mind. She has become explosive intolerant irritable...

-----

So anyway, we've been to Fiji, Thailand, etc.  I love her a lot.

About 2 years ago she injured her knee by tripping over a pavement brick and it has not recovered - as a result she has been able to play netball since which she dearly misses, 6 months later she developed terrible stomach aches and had to have surgery to remove two giant cysts on her ovaries.  Then, they discovered she also has endometriosis.  Then, 6 months later they discovered that her ovaries have a low reserve count (fewer eggs left for a woman her age).  Then, 6 months later she is rushed to hospital with a heart problem.  She has atrial fibrillation, and it could return at any time and be life threatening (or, in all likelihood, it may be doing something funny"").

For her entire life she has known for certain that she wants to have children, since I didn't think I was ready to have kids.  Some compromises and some therapy later, I saw that I did indeed see myself with kids in the future, and that we should start trying soon, because it was so important.  This was further delayed when she suffered the aforementioned heart problem, which left her at home and on strong drugs for a few weeks.  But then we started trying.

I've known that she has seriously wanted to marry me since at least March of last year (10 months ago), and I do see myself getting married in the future, but I haven't so far done so with her because it hasn't yet ""felt right"".

We have a lot of love in our relationship and we're able to comfort each other fairly well most of the time.  We both love cuddles in bed.  We are generous to each other and I don't think she has a mean bone in her entire body.  We basically share our lives with each other.  Occasionally we do things that annoy each other.  Gradually last year, or at least most of the time.  I was staying up later after she went to bed most nights, which she was desperately unhappy with because it disturbs her sleep if I come to bed later than her.  This came up in last year's mini-crisis where we were at therapy, and we agreed that I come to bed with her early at least 2 nights a week, and before midnight each other night.  I felt this to be a good compromise at the time.

She is incredibly outgoing and fills her social calendar with engagements.  She has a large family and large groups of friends in various parts of the state and it is not unusual for us to be away 2 or 3 weekends a month, and learn to start saying ""no"" more.

My important life goals are in the form of the pursuits I like to do on my own - work on my photography, etc.  Eventually I'd like to become very good and take these skills places, but at the moment I do it outside of work hours as a hobby, and then only every now and again.  I feel as if our social engagements, the bed time I agreed to, her desire to interact with me whenever we are both home (she protests that I get plenty of time to myself when she goes out, so when she comes home I should be able to be with her), but mostly just needing significantly less time to herself than I do

This resentment surfaces as a slight grumpiness or shortness with her when I am doing something (expecting to have an hour or two to myself) and she needs me for something, but so frequently I can't, or it's a night I've agreed to come to bed with her.

We have been trying to get pregnant.  The sex has been decent, has been a bit utilitarian since it has to be timed precisely.  Sex hasn't been much of a factor in any of our problems and it's not like we've gone for really long times without it.

This is where we get to what absolutely frightens me.  Mid-year 2012 at the time we went to counselling, I was already seriously worrying about the ""getting enough time to myself"" thing.  This may have been building up to a mild feeling of doubt about whether I wanted her as my life partner.  At the time, I did express this to her, and discussed it at length in therapy.  And one thing I kept repeating was that I didn't think I could commit until life was more back to ""normal"".  For homework I had to go and think what ""normal"" means.  And I described it as meaning, without major dramas causing stress.  She had had a bunch of health scares, we'd had a drama with having to move twice in quick succession due to health problems at one place, and all this stress was definitely dominating our headspaces all throughout 2012.

What frightens me is that that thought, and seems to have snowballed.  Right now, I think I really want out, and I think that it hasn't anything to do with her health problems or certain events anymore.  I think it is a feeling inside me that I've just realised is growing real.  But I feel incredible guilty.  We're not pregnant yet, and with her rapidly dwindling fertility she is in quite a lot of trouble without me because her ability to have kids, the one thing she really wants most in all of the world, is threatened.

A week ago, really loved it.  The night before we played board games, just the two of us, all night for new year's eve.  It was the most awesome time I have had in ages.

Then, perhaps a couple of hours, before my agreed bed time of 12 midnight.  Fifteen minutes in, she had a major panic about her friend's hen's party, how she didn't want to go.  I stayed with her and comforted her for just under half an hour (I got in a lot of trouble for actually checking on my watch), and told her I was going to go off and go back to what I was doing.  This started a massive fight, because I was prioritizing my own time over her.  We argued at length and I made my case that I still needed more time to myself, on most nights (doesn't have to be every night) would probably be what I'd be really happy with.  The next day, and despite her obviously regretting what she had asked for and not wanting me to go, maybe just for a week or so.

So I stayed with parents, with say 96% certainty, that I need to break up with her now.  It will pretty much ruin her life, at least for the forseeable future.  She would recover, some day, in a way.  But not in the same way as if we'd stay together, and perhaps with the added problem of not having any way to try for children for the forseeable future (which I am really dreading).

An objective

Last time we had a crisis last year, of all our happiest times together.  She had tears streaming down my face, and I knew I wanted to be with her and make everything work.  This time, even though we're on a break, she's left them out on the coffee table for me to discover when I drop by our place.  Again, tears streaming down my face right now, but not with the same resolve that I want to be with her.  Maybe it's decreased my certainty that I want to leave by a little bit.

EDIT: So the burning question in my head is: work on these problems or walk out on the woman I truly love?  And if I stay and try

**EDIT 2**: Thank you to *everyone* who has taken the time to read this and reply.  I have to be honest, but also I'm beginning to feel that there are things about myself I want to change, and am scared that a lot of these problems are problems with me.  I think I have an unhealthy addiction to wasting time on the internet (and yeah, in my main account I *heavily* use Reddit and it does affect my personality).  And I've flip-flopped in how I feel about being alone and having a future without her.  It's a terrible time, and right now I want to be with her (and that's being honest).  And I have to work through some stuff to know what that feeling means.

**EDIT 3**: Wow, some commenters have had the balls (and what looks like, experience) to tell me that crises like this don't have to be the end of a relationship if two people both want to change and are willing to work for it, that I need to take a long hard look at myself too, like my utter shambles of time-management skills and prioritising my time.  And maybe my ""everything must be perfect"" is a form of selfishness and totally unrealistic anyway.  Anyway, stuff to work through in due course and who knows what will come of it.  I've also discovered that a couple I know broke up twice, fixed themselves, had kids, or the biggest most important time in my entire life.  That we'll stop trying for a baby until this is better sorted kind of goes without saying - I don't think there's doubt about that.  I'm off to get both professional help AND better communicate.

Any money she earns if she is working typically goes to gas

My wife doesn't contribute much at home, has alcohol problems, abuses me verbally when drunk, doesn't do anything around the house unless I nag repeatedly and turns the tables almost every time I try to talk about it so I end up being the one who feels bad.  She was/is being treated for depression because her alcoholic father is dying.  She will end up taking care of his funeral and junk because the rest of her family is clueless and can't be bothered to help anyway.

I've been dealing with this situation as best I can, frequently driving home drunk.  If she has our daughter it is common for me to go out of my way to pick her up, leaving wifey behind to drink until after 11pm.  Unfortunately I can't deal with or afford this emotionally or financially anymore.  I can't function at home even though I'm fine at work, I can smile and laugh there and mean it.  But by the time I get home my shoulders sag.  Instead I get angry because I feel alone, which makes her withdraw even more.  Alone with my daughter I do not get angry, except for a few times the last couple weeks.  I'm hoping it's because stress.

Then yesterday she had sex with my best friend.  She was acting even stranger than normal so I got curious.  They did it once that day for sure, but I can sum it quickly: lies and pawning our daughter off on a relative (unbeknownst to me) so she can go get drunk.

This morning I called in to work and took my daughter to school.  Told the wife to go see her friend a couple hours away for a day or two so I can think.  I even gave her cash for the trip.

It's possible this relationship can be salvaged

------

right now you are fifteen years old, a boy with long limbs and pale skin and dirty brown hair that is always in his eyes.  and you will fall hard for him- really hard- and you barely even know why you’re secretly excited to intercept him at 8 am on his way to calculus class.  and he will drive you to the grocery store and watch 80’s movies with you, and you will find yourself laughing at all his jokes because you swear he is the coolest person you’ve ever met.  then you will find yourself in your first apartment, still only sixteen years old, as this boy wraps his hands around yours and kisses you on that tiny twin-sized bed.  then you will lose your virginities to each other on that bedroom floor, listening to that generation x song that still makes your hands tremble on the steering wheel whenever you hear it years later.  and the two of you will drive everywhere in that grey jeep cherokee, during cold winter nights that fog your passenger side window and blur every street lamp.  and you will tell him you love him, they become your family

and it won't matter that he’s becoming distant, and your friends tell you he’s selfish, and your instincts tell you you’re unhappy, but you keep trying and trying and trying.  and you will watch relationships bloom and burst all around you and you tell yourself that you will be the ones to really make it.  that the two of you will get married, and all your youthful disappointments can be discarded as growing pains and shoved aside to make room for better memories.  

and then he will sit down beside you one cold november night, that the two of you can still hang out.  and this boy- your best friend, who held your hand through seven years- will say *you have no bearing on my life*.  and you will experience a crushing, dizzying wave of pain that makes it very difficult to breathe.  and he will ask you to stop crying because it’s making it difficult for him to fall asleep.

and the next day you go to work and move your limbs like they are hardwired and automated, you break like a dam and the sounds that come from your mouth are barely even human.  and you are sobbing *i loved him, i loved him, i loved him for so long and he left me* until words no longer make sense and your ragged voice just becomes an animalistic keening, pitched hard for pain.  and your mother, on the other end, she cries with you because she knows the heartbreak that is coming.

and you will lie against those bathroom tiles and count them for hours between your dry heaves.  you will see couples holding hands in the streets and struggle to fight back hot waves of tears.  you will start writing an angry, your photos, your internet- you will discover every possible browser extension to keep that pain at bay.  you will see friends and go on lukewarm dates and think about crawling into your bed and never coming back out.  you will dream about him constantly and wake up feeling like someone unloaded a shotgun into your chest.  and then you will realize that the only way through the pain is the path of self-improvement.
  
and then slowly but surely- your life will become a movie montage set to upbeat tempos as you work out furiously and see a counselor and reconnect with steadfast friends who never once tell you to shut up when you find his name again and again in your mouth like a hated speech defect.  and you will eventually stop updating that angry unsent letter, and feel happier with every single minute that divides you from those memories.  and then one day you will drive home after work and realize very suddenly that your shoulders and heart feel lighter- because for the first time in seven years you are not worrying about where a relationship is going.

and over time the mental image of his face will recede into faint recognition as you redistribute him into a forgotten pile of people you used to know, your days will flood with opportunities, and then one night you will reconnect with an old friend who invites you to his company party.

and then the two of you will find yourselves drawn inexplicably like magnets, falling in love despite all your past fears and invisible bruises.  and you will move in together, build a happy life together, and and it will be better than anything you could have ever hoped for when you were fifteen years old.

1370745445.0,1fylum,"""You're crazy go see a Dr!""",letmesink,165,39,99,"My(F25) husband(M38) together 6 years. Married 4 years
My husband has a VERY colorful past. Some of which I wish I did not know. And he did some things while with me that messed up my trust in him. 
I used to be pretty laid back

I love my husband he's very smart and is a wonderful father. We share a lot of things in common. Sometimes it's crazy and hard to believe. We're very comfortable with each other and I believe we communicate well overall. He's also the only one that gets my sense of humor. He is also the only person I have in my life with my daughter. My side of the family is gone. 

I'm not perfect. I suffer from depression
Where my husband work is full of female co-worker. He's been working there almost a year now. And in the beginning I'll admit he bugged the crap out of me but I've cooled off since then. And my husband always tells me: ""You have nothing to worry about!""
He also told me one day that if he did cheat that ""I would never find out about it"" you can believe that this one didn't sit well with me at all. And absolutely did not help my trust issues with him.

Anyways
Anyways she never came to say hi to him and neither did he but caught him many times looking at her. 
I heard and saw her and his boss looking at me and talking. And and overheard her talking about my daughter saying that it's good my daughter looks like him.
Then when the birthday was about over and I was getting to get home, saying to him ""oh I already met your wife!"". Even though we did not talk. 

So you can believe that I was super pissed off right there and then. Because he basically lied to my face acting like he didn't know her. Now this? Also I found out she's taking classes to that one college my husband is actively trying to transfer himself to. That didn't sit right with me either.

So we go home and we argued as discretely as possible because his mom is here visiting
Since I been diagnosed with depression he always pull that one on me to shut up. ""Go see a doctor! You're crazy!""
I tried to tell him that 2 people that OBVIOUSLY know each other don't ignore each other so hard at a birthday party where there is barely anyone. And that I was upset he acted like he didn't know her.
He say he didn't want to mention her because he'll know I'd be jealous but he sure didn't mind introducing me to his female boss.
I don't know I just think all this is really off. He makes me feel like I'm insane. I been feeling sick all day with headaches that won't go away. I want to scream and cry but nothing comes out. My body feel numb. 

I don't know reddit maybe I'm looking for validation that I am indeed crazy and looking too far into it. Maybe I need a reality check? 

TL;DR: Husband acting suspicious with coworker, and need a Dr :(

I am the oldest of 5 children and don't feel that there was much special about my childhood. Both parents are still alive and I get along with them fine. Siblings and I get along fine.

My wife and I argue a few times a month and when I feel like she is trying to cow me or just push me around verbally or just don't understand why she is emotional. I get angry and try to avoid her until I calm down. I don't like fighting or arguing and when I get angry I leave the situation if I can. Usually I go to another room of the house and try to avoid her for a while. Sometimes she is right and sometimes I am. In then end

My wife seems like she is jealous of my eldest daughter. My daughter can see the strange behavior of my wife and has avoided coming to my house for about 8 months. She finally recently came to visit for a weekend and sure enough my wife started acting strange from the moment she knew my daughter was going to arrive until she left. (By 'strange' I mean my wife is short with me and speaks to me like she is angry with me. She avoided saying anything to my eldest daughter all weekend and treated her like she wasn't there. She was quick to find fault with my eldest and came to me privately demanding to know what I was going to do to correct said 

My wife gets along great with my other two daughters and they are close. I like this and am happy about it. But my eldest daughter

This last visit, but was nothing at all). My wife blew it way out of proportion and was demanding to know what I was going to do about it. I told her that she was being ridiculous and that there was nothing to be done. Wife got more and more angry and belligerent until I left the room and went upstairs to avoid her.

Later she confronted me again and I ignored her for a bit until I was angry enough to get up from the chair in which I sat

I heard her say something about calling the police and I ignored it because she has said outlandish things before when she is angry that she never followed through with.

After the police showed up

Let me reinforce that I have never hurt or had a desire to hurt my wife or anyone else for that matter. Violence just isn't in my nature and I don't look for it

I told the police that I didn't push her or break anything else (not sure why they asked about anything being broken). And after a while the police left (while making sure I knew that I was lucky I wasn't being arrested).

As I was returning to the house to let my daughters know that we could now leave

I quietly said

I then took my daughters to meet their mom. After I returned home I told my wife that I could no longer trust her and that I didn't want to be married to her anymore. I felt that way at the time and I still feel some remnants of that now

I have not spoken to her in a few days (or even seen her

I'm at a loss Reddit.  My libido is figuratively crawling out of my skin right now  She stays over quite often and I feel awkward masturbating when she's there.  I've expressed my deep desire to make love, but if this continues it might.  Any advice is appreciated.

**EDIT** To be fair

**EDIT 2** To further clarify, and when we go out everything is split pretty much down the middle.  She brings me lunch at my office four days a week, sometimes it's home made, sometimes its purchased, but she comes and spends an hour with me out of her day (most times driving across town to come to me).  Everything other than this one aspect of the relationship is literally the best I could ask for.

**EDIT 3**  So after a long discussion last night during which we stripped away each of the ""shoddy"" reasons, we agreed to try intercourse, and continue to try until we get it down.  We made an attempt last night, and even though we had to stop due to a full scale hyperventilating panic attack on her part, we at least made the attempt.

Long story as short as I can make it: my sister ""Kathy"" was married for almost twenty years and the majority of that time her husband ""Loren"" carried on affair after affair. Yes

I will give them this, family trips and vacations - they showered their kiddos with time and attention.

The ""cycle"" finally broke about five years ago.  One of Loren's affairs turned into an actual relationship. Kathy for the first time couldn't guilt him back and BAM, she followed his new girlfriend around, she called both their places of work repeatedly, tried to vandalize their cars/homes, and so on.

I sympathize

The fact is that Loren and this girl are serious, all it does is stress out the kids and make the rest of us worry for Kathy's health. She refuses to date and can't stop going on about how men are so awful (she doesn't get why this is inappropriate to go on about in front of her SONS). She seems to think it's healthy for her boys to hear so they can ""avoid their father's path.""

She's in counseling

I'll try to keep this brief. I cheated. Details don't really matter. It was more than once and with more than one person. I was faithful the entire LD duration until 4 weeks ago

We have been doing good with the distance and we try to skype every day and we were writing actual letters to one another and I felt close to her. I thought we would make it through the long distance but I wasn't able to. I've talked this out with some of my coworkers and there are basically a couple camps. Some of my coworkers are basically telling me what happens in Bangkok stays in Bangkok and that she probably has been cheating on me to (I don't know the answer to that. I don't think so but I obviously cannot be certain). Granted these are the guys who helped me get into this situation. The other side is to confess it all to her and then break up with her. 

I'm sure we have to break-up. I've been cheated on before. Its the worst. Nothing is ever the same. What my question is does she deserve an explanation/confession of my cheating? A side question

Just an update I guess I owe to you guys out there who gave me sincere and really awesome advice. So firstly here's a big THANK YOU!

So we broke up officially today and I have no intent of revisiting this relationship

Over the past week or so I have began to look at things from a new perspective - one with me being more aware of my own interests. I have come to realised that after what had happened, her decision to return back to the same holiday destination, where all that has had happened happened, kinda showed me how much (or in this case, little) she regretted and is willing to make it up.

She left on a 4-day Spa retreat with her mom and returned on Sunday. Before her retreat, to an extent. I could be truly happy and love her during our recent dates, but at the end of everyday the realisation sets in and I find myself taking a step back, reluctant to put my whole heart again. So I told her everything that was on my mind, and requested that she would consider if she wanted me more than she wants her single life because I was not too convinced about that.

Today she told me that she hated me for ruining her retreat, that she was not the only one hurting and feeling so anguished. She went on to tell me that I am too overprotective and was suffocating her, and that she was hurting about our ""communication"" problem. I did not see a point in arguing back since I did not have the intent of salvaging this relationship, though eventually we settled that maybe she just couldn't accept me for me. 

I'm gonna wrap up my ranting here. We have broken up and I am actually doing much better than expected. I feel that I am able to see more clearly now and that even though this relationship (that probably wasn't built to last right from the start) didn't work out, more about myself.

I [f/25] have known my boyfriend [m/23] for a little over two years; he lived with me a while back when he was getting back on his feet

Possibly relevant background: we are from a very conservative rural area.  I am from a liberal, his parents used to lock him in an attic and leave him there for so long he'd have to pee in a towel because he couldn't hold it any longer; not out of any active cruelty, just in the way some people put their dog out on a chain in the yard and forget about it.  Families are usually very isolated, and children spend the vast majority of their time with only their siblings for company.  Just to contextualize all this a bit.  Also, all sex ed is abstinence-only.

Anyway.  When he was around 10-11, though he worries that he was manipulative and inadvertently coerced them to experiment with him.  He and his younger sister (I think she would have been around 9 at the time?) ""played doctor"" a few times - he didn't give me the details, and it clearly still bothers him.  He and his younger brother (I think he would have been around 7) exchanged oral sex.  His mother found out, talked to her therapist about it, and the therapist reported it to the police.  He was convicted of raping his brother and lived in group homes and juvies for the remainder of his childhood.  He was not allowed back in his parents' house until he was 16; when his father died in a car accident when he was 12, he was let out to go to the funeral but was not allowed to be near his family.

At the group home, he had been addicted to heroin/opiates for about 2-3 years and he had a felony conviction for possession of LSD.  He started living with me at the tail end of that addiction; I told him that we could hang out whenever he wanted, except when he was fucked up, and I guess he liked hanging out with me more than spending all his money on junk, because pretty soon he was spending almost every night on my couch.  After he had been clean for about a year, he told me he was in love with me and we've been together ever since.  He is unfailingly kind, polite and doesn't display any of these manipulative traits that he is so worried about, and he is currently reading an issue of *Science* and keeps interrupting me to tell me about carbon nanotubes or some shit.

I've really been struggling to decide what to feel about this whole thing.  I volunteer at the local women's shelter, though, his story is just sad; a story with no bad guys, where everyone is the victim.  He is unquestionably scarred from what happened - it defined his whole life from that point.  But I worry that by acknowledging that, I am somehow minimizing the pain that his siblings must have gone through.  And I can't get around the fact that I will of course be predisposed to be sympathetic to his version of the story and I can't trust myself to be objective.  (I should note that he is honest to a fault, and though it has occurred to me that he could be sugarcoating what happened, I personally believe that he is being truthful.)  

My gut feeling is that what happened was tragic for everyone involved

So

Long story short- he and I are done. There are tons of juicy details I would be happy to relate, but not necessarily bad. I'm leaning on a friend who has had two divorces, and she has been very supportive with both her heart and her couch. I need documents proving we have filed for divorce before I can get housing, and apparently that's about $200, which is rough. I don't even think we can pawn our wedding rings for that much, but worst case scenario I hope a parent here or there might help. The biggest bummer is with my mother in law, who is a close friend and whom I love. Her seeing what's going on in our relationship reminds her of what happened in her ex husband's and her relationship. She's disappointed in her son right now

I told him I had gotten a lot of supportive comments, and that it wasn't as ""no big deal"" as he was trying to make it.

We have been trying to manage our money better and I have been actively watching Dave Ramsey classes, my boyfriend cannot seem to stop buying the amounts he is used to! He has a $1000 debt to his university before he can go back to school and hasn't paid ANY of it

Now, but he still burns through it in record time. Since our finances our separate, I only control my bank account, although I write up a monthly budget for each of us individually. This month, being the first of the year, I made it especially detailed. He gets paid twice a month and his paycheck left him with a $150 balance after paying all the bills this half of the month. He went out and immediately spent it on weed, and then has the audacity to ask me if I can pitch in to buy extra groceries, all the weed smoking costs us money in food because he gets the munchies. When I told him that we didn't have any extra food stamps for that, when he did a favor for our dealer friend and was given a full week's weed FREE. He has already burned through it!

I don't know what to do. I don't like telling other people how to spend their money and he gets really angry when I bring up that he should cut back, although he does spend a lot of cash he makes in tips on caffeine drinks. I have approached it from the standpoint of dealing with someone who has an addiction, but frankly, reddit, I'm tired. I don't like finding resin all over everything, and I don't like not having a dresser because my boyfriend would rather spend $100 on smokeables instead of saving up with me to get us things we need for our apartment.

Recently, he's a great guy, but I would rather that she does not. She will send him texts on a Tuesday night being like ""You should come over and help me finish this bottle of wine, I can't do it on my own"" and is very touchy-feely with him at work (grabbing his arm, hugging him, etc)

So far my boyfriend has not been responsive, texting me during their breaks, all that stuff. I know rationally that he wouldn't cheat on me, because he's just not that sort of guy, but then I start thinking and worrying and I get, I don't know, jealous, five days a week

I was cheated on once before during a three-year relationship that ended about a year and a half ago (as a result of the cheating) and I'm desperately afraid of getting hurt like that again. He tells me not to worry whenever I voice my concerns, etc.... but I worry anyway. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with these worries/jealousy/overall paranoia? I don't want to be this paranoid crazy person but I don't know how to stop, and there's nothing I can do about that, so I would just like to know how I can not let worrying about that inevitable fact of life bother me.

Been dating for 4 years. ,flowersnpowers,163,38,297,"When we first started dating, but it usually ends up that we both give up and go back to old habits. We decided to start another weight loss program together a month ago

Last night he tells me that one of his requirements for a wife is that she cannot weigh more than him, and has considered giving me an ultimatum (lose weight or we're done), but decided not to.  

I don't understand why he would tell me this about my weight now, and today I have no desire to see him or talk to him. It makes me want to starve myself, get skinny, and dump his ass when I'm back to the weight I was at when I was an athlete. 

I have always tried to love him unconditionally, then tells me this last night. I honestly don't know what to think. 

I am considering breaking up with him

TL;DR: Girl weighs more than her SO

Please try not to be too harsh

EDIT: I am 5'9, although he might have lost weight recently as well. 3 years ago at the most fit I was in my life, I was 167 with an athletic build. 

When he said this last night

ANOTHER EDIT: The frequency of sex has not gone down. We do not live together. He is my first boyfriend. He is still very cuddly and we have a good time when we are together. He tells me I look nice when I wear a dress or do my hair a special way. And I do try to dress up for him very often. I've decided not to break up with him

UPDATE: I had a very rough day. This morning I ate cereal and did not eat for the rest of the day. When I felt hungry, I wouldn't have an appetite anyway. I REALIZE THIS IS INCREDIBLY UNHEALTHY AND WILL NOT DO IT AGAIN.

SO and I just finished talking. I told him that it's not fair of him to make me compare myself to anyone else, so be it. It shouldn't be about the numbers on the scale. I told him that I agree that he deserves to be with someone who is healthy and who he is attracted to. He said that usually, females should weigh less than a male taller than him, and weight is often an indicator of health. I told him, what if i got down to 165, and you got down to 160, how is that fair? He said that I made a good point and would rather me be at a healthy weight rather than just ""weighing less than him"" from a numbers perspective.

I asked why he decided to tell me last night. He said that it had been on his mind for a very long time and just randomly picked last night to say it. I told him I needed him to understand why I did feel hurt by it. I thought I was doing a good job
I also told him about me not eating today. He told me this is not what he wanted for me at all, just slightly less of it.)

I feel much better about the whole thing

1374159683.0,1ik8w7,Broke up with my [22M] girlfriend [21F]--then she asked for our sex toys because...,ANOWB,176,55,147,"**DISCLAIMER: I know I’m being silly and many of the things I say are unfair. For the most part

So my girlfriend broke up with me around a month ago. I loved her

It came as a shock, I genuinely thought we’d worked them out. I was looking forward to a long summer together going places, doing things, and having fun, but when I went home for the weekend I got a text saying that she was sorry, but she no longer loved me.

It hurt, and told myself I needed to move on. I really love her. I saw a future with her. I don’t need to go on about how much she means to me, because I’m sure you’ve heard it all a hundred times before. But I felt as if my entire future had suddenly been taken from me (although I *didn’t* rant about this to her—it wouldn’t be fair for her or healthy to me).

She also *repeatedly* said that she hoped we could be friends. As in

So

Two problems.

Firstly, so we were still in contact (we’d ended it on a good note, so it wasn’t *too* awkward, but I still knew it wasn’t good for me).

Secondly, and if we *hadn’t* broken up, we’d of had months of the summer to do things together. If this had happened, I told myself, then *maybe* she wouldn’t have decided she didn’t love me.

I spent a couple of weeks writing this letter. She knew it was on the way. When I sent it
read it, I knew it was a stupid idea anyway.

So

I asked why. She gave some vague response. I asked “Do you have a new boyfriend?” and continued asking questions until she revealed all (I didn’t force her to answer or demand that she do so; while I take full responsibility for asking the questions in the first place
She has a friend-with-benefits

It’s probably at least 50% true. She has a history of lies to make things easier for herself (nothing amazingly major, when it goes without saying that a firm “I’m not in the mood,” would have been enough).

I also asked, she said, she was upset but didn’t cry. While unrelated, this still kind of hurt, but I’d known it was true for a while now.

*She hasn’t done anything wrong.* She broke up with me, it’ll be something along the lines of that it *is* someone I know (I understand why she wouldn’t tell me this), the number of times she’s had sex, etc. And she has absolutely no duty to tell me the truth about damn near anything any more.

But I’m still in a bit of a state. It’s *mostly* jealousy

Firstly, all the times she told me she loved me, weren’t enough to upset her enough to stop her having sex with a guy she met within days of breaking up with me.

Secondly, but she knew I was writing this letter as a sort of postscript to our relationship when she met and had sex with this guy. Again, she hasn’t done anything *wrong* as such, but it still hurts.

Finally… the stuff she asked for me were (a) bought by me; (b) paid for by me; (c) barely used because *she* didn’t want to; 
(d) worth *£10*. Instead of just going out and spending £10 replacing them, I’m totally having sex with this guy.”

I sound like a whiny child. Our relationship is over; maybe in the future some time we might be able to salvage a friendship (which will take *far longer* that she thinks it will

But it hurts

Even my father is happy about it. He isn't as religious as mum but I thought he might be sternly disappointed. Turns out he's been worrying about my safety in a strange new city alone (cute) and is glad I'll have an advocate and says he won't worry as much!

**Short recap: My boyfriend of two years and I had a child together

I've had a change of heart since my first post.  He's shown me his true colors since then, he turns me down, citing ridiculous reasons--""I don't like the owner's brother,"" ""They don't have air conditioning,"" ""They're only looking for someone part time,"" ""They're looking for someone to work round the clock,"" etc.  

Meanwhile, I take her to see him every time I go out there to give him a ride to the store, every other day or so, so he's obviously been lying to them about what's going on.  

And, r/relationships, the motherfucker had the nerve to say we should come back and live with him when he's **selling her things** to buy himself cigarettes.  **Cigarettes!**  Not formula.  Not bug spray.  Not new carpet.  Cigarettes.  

So I basically told him to fuck off.  She doesn't need that kind of parent in her life, and blocked him from being able to contact me.  I realize that's probably only temporary, since we still have a child linking us together, but I think if I talked to him right now I'd end up killing him.  

I really regret everything that's happened.  I never thought I'd be the kind of idiot who would put herself in this situation, I'm going to take some responsibility for the child that I brought into this world, get over my own problems, and be a good parent.  No matter what it takes.  

Thank you to everyone who told me he was an asshole before.  I should have taken your words to heart more.

I just wanted to start this by saying thank you to everyone who replied

I talked to him last night after he was done showering and all that stuff. He asked why I seemed so upset today and that threw me off because I thought he would have known because of what happened the night before. Prior to his homecoming I had written a list of things I wanted to say and how I wanted to say it so that I didn't miss anything or say things in a blaming tone. 

I said something along the lines of: 

""I know part of the reason you don't want to have sex as much any more is because I've been putting a lot of stress &amp; pressure on it and I just wanted you to know that I really don't mean to do that to you, so much. Even if I don't get off it is still always amazing. ""

""The reason I can't cum has extremely little to do with you. The only way you're affecting it at all is just because I always feel like you're just doing it because you have too and that you're never really into it. I want you to enjoy it as much as I do so I get distracted and worried and can't focus on how well you are pleasing me like I should be. We need to learn together what works for us

""I miss how we were in the beginning of our relationship. When I would easily be able to turn you on and when we used to cuddle all the time on the couch and make out. I think mainly I miss the affection I used to get  and I know the honey moon stage is just a stage but I would really just love to make out on the couch or cuddle like we used too.""

""I want you to know that i love you so fucking much and I don't mean to stress you out or ruin sex for you by pestering you into it. But even though I love you to death I can't stay in a relationship like this forever. I need to feel loved, or nag, or to be a bitch, but I still feel undesired by you and lonely in our relationship. And I know i said it last time but this is honestly my last attempt because this has been mentally exhausting for me ""

I also suggested that maybe we see a couples therapist as well as not having any sexual contact for thirty days to rebuilt the mental intimacy before the physical intimacy. 

He didn't really say anything. After my little speel we just kind of sat silently for ten minutes. (Other than my sobs cause I'm a cry baby). Finally he said ""so how much time do I have"" i was pretty upset that that is all he got out of my whole speel but I told him that I refuse to put a time limit on it for obvious reasons. After that he was silent again for a while and eventually said that he was really sorry and that he didn't mean to be like that and that he knows he is hurting me and that he does not want to lose me. Same things he has said for the past year or so... I just said that is okay I know he doesn't mean to do this and that sometimes people just don't match no matter how bad they want too. 

He was silent again for about half an hour

He said I was right and then told me that he thinks the reason that he hasn't been as horny lately is because he isn't pleased with how he looks and since he isn't attracted to himself he finds it difficult to become horny at all. I told him that I completely understood and that I've been there myself. Now he is promising that he will stop cheating on our eating healthy diet while he is at work and that he is going to start running every day again.. I was a little upset that he waited almost a year to tell me that

So I am going to give him another chance

(For the record, it's $17 an hour, full time, benefits, and reasonable deals on insurance, trying to make me late and cry as well.

Last night, etc, and the two of us have a really solid plan. We spend every weekend and nearly every weekday with one another, and we are very happy, mesh very well, and moving in together just feels like the next step for us. Well, she wasn't interested in conversation. She continuously told us we were being stupid, etc, and I came back around midnight when she was asleep.


Today is hell. I knew she was going to be bitchy when I got out of my room, then when I said no she started saying how I'm just going to be living paycheck to paycheck the rest of my life (which I won't be) and will never have time to act again. (Which I won't - part of the reason why I took this job was because I have every night and Sunday off, which works great for rehearsal and show schedules. I told her that and she blew me off.) Then she went on to say how my boyfriend is only using me for sex and rent so he can live somewhere else, and how he's putting me in danger because apparently she thinks the apartment we chose is ""a shithole"". (It isn't. I think it's quite nice and cute. She apparently went there last night, even though I didn't tell her the address, and ""checked it all out"".) She wouldn't stop berating me, saying how I'm ""settling"" and how I'm ""surrounding myself with idiots"". She's extremely upset that I ""made this decision without involving the family"". But honestly, not them. I can't even go to my room to be alone because she continuously is coming in periodically to berate me more

I'm just completely at a loss and don't know what to do. I'm trying so hard not to cry because I know it's not worth it. I'm just so exasperated with this situation and living environment.

GF; 18
been together 8 months.

She has been the victim of rape and sexual abuse and a lot of verbal abuse by family/ex bofriend. It has pretty evidently affected her self esteem and self worth overall. Recently she confided in me that she wants to engage in some dom/sub and light (pretty much mainstream) bondage. She really likes verbal degradation and being hit/slapped around

 I do not think this is a good idea, like biting her tits, taking control just a bit during sexytimes. We haven't had intercourse more than  6-10  times because of the lack of oppurtunities but the times we do sometimes she almost burst in to tears for no reason. I would try and stop and give her the attention she needed but she always just takes a second to recompose herself and encourages me to continue. 


One time, and she choked up and began crying and tried to push me off her and as soon as i realised she was serious i stopped. 
Point being; i really do not think engaging in verbal degradation/bdsm/bondage will do her mental health any good. At the same time

tl;dr- gf has been abused and raped a while ago and now wants me to treat her like a sex toy basically in the bedroom

TL;DR: My husband rarely follows through on promises

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Husband is a redditor

Throughout our relationship, he'll ask me if I want onions on a burger and I'll say very clearly 'NO' - I've always hated onions - and he puts extra onions on. I'll say 'I said I don't want onions' and he will respond 'yeah, but burgers are better with onions') to large issues (he is on a business trip and asked if I would like to fly alone with the kids to meet up with him at the end of his trip. I told him 'I appreciate the offer, but I'm really not comfortable flying with the kids on my own.' Also, there is a small possibility that his schedule will change and he won't be there to meet us. I don't want to take that risk so I said 'I really don't like the idea. It makes me uncomfortable and I don't want to do it.' The next day, I received confirmation emails for non-refundable plane tickets.)

I also can't trust him to follow through with his responsibilities. I have to handle everything financial, but need to pay off the loan before the new owner can register it. The car is solely in his name, so he needs to be the one to contact the bank about paying it off. He keeps putting off the phone call, even though it will be a simple call to make and it will remove a lot of inconvenience for everyone involved.

He blames all of our relationship problems on him having ADHD. Apparently, it's my ADHD'. I've asked him to go to a doctor and look into options to treat it, whether that be medication or Cognitive Behavior Therapy, and he won't. He says that having an official diagnosis of ADHD will harm his career. The only option he will consider is marijuana. He says it makes him think more clearly and works better than anything else would. His employer does random drug tests and he would lose his job if he was found with pot in his system, but apparently that would be less detrimental to his career than CBT???

I don't know what to do anymore. Any time I look at him I feel angry, because it feels like he doesn't respect me. His refusal to deal with his ADHD makes me furious; I feel like he is using it as an excuse to ignore everything in life. Like it's a get out of jail free card.

I've tried to talk to him about this numerous times, I will tell him the answer in the most straightforward way possible, but he still doesn't listen.

That seemed to be like an ongoing thing

If anyone stuck around and read the thread, I realized it wasn't a good idea to keep the relationship up. **I broke up with Jen.**  Friday morning, on skype (which is as stupid an idea as it sounds like for future reference). I kinda just went through the steps, and told her I loved her, but I didn't think our relationship could last with the age difference... something I've worried about before. That I was kind of concerned and scared about us (more me) being in trouble legally, if something was to go awry. And that we should both be single, and enjoy ourselves

She.did.not.take.it.well. 

I can't exactly describe things, uncomfortable conversations I've had. She accused me of everything... from cheating (for the record, never cheated on her) to being a coward, and she tried to say we weren't broken up, even though I just broke up with her. I'm usually a pushover with Jen, but I held firm, and the break-up is final though. 

She has been texting me on/off since then, not that I expect anyone to sympathize with me lol, to not respond. I'm hoping kind of that she moves on, and we can put this behind us. The whole breakup kind of showed me that yeah, she wasn't maybe as mature as I thought. And I like the idea of being single more than I realized. And the idea of not flirting with police issues. So this breakup was probably a very, good idea.

I've always ignored it because in general I don't like physical contact.

I ended up sitting next to my dad on the bed and he started stroking my legs with his feet, but I went in there before him to use their bathroom and told them I'd like to sit next to my mom, which my dad didn't approve of because ""myboyfriendsname wants to sit there and will be disappointed"".

My boyfriend then shows up and takes my old seat

Next time I decided to just be blunt and told him that I would be sitting next to my mom

I should probably also mention that he took this creepy picture of me as a naked child

Says it's none of my business because it pre-dates us.,23throwmeaway23,176,50,91,"He [29M - let's call him John] and I have been together just under two years with mid-distance (seeing each other every weekend) for 1 1/2 years of that time. While living in different cities

Back in July, but that this woman wanted him to be, so while he dated her he was 'daddy' -- said she does that with all of her boyfriends. They didn't work out because she was 'nuts.' I accept this at face value.

John moved to my city (2 hours from where he was previously stationed) to live with me after getting out of the Army. He strongly dislikes the midwest, located in California. No relationship with that one. 

Initially it was great. As my first experience living with a SO, but heavy sexting - a boundary we both knew was cheating. After finding out, I was obviously devastated. Cancelled the wedding (which was paid for already). He begged, pleaded for another chance. After I took some time, I decide that I loved him enough to try my best to overcome this. Wedding was still off, but in a relationship.

**Fast forward to now.** Things have been getting better

But because of the cheating, and find one from prior to meeting me... talking about his son that I never knew existed. I knew about two of his children (who he doesn't have a relationship with but wants to with GA baby), but not a third. Turns out he slept with a married woman, she got pregnant. His name is not on the birth certificate, but admits his fatherhood via the messages I saw.

Through these messages, as well as multiple times on other relationships.

I talk to him about it. Non confrontational. Say I feel like I was lied to, as they never did full paternity tests. Said she doesn't want him in her life anyway (bc he cheated, go figure), so the kid is not his. Being raised by her husband. Said that I needed to drop it, isn't wasn't any of my business because it pre-dates our relationship.

I tell him that this directly affects our relationship. As we were going to get married, he lied when I asked him about the kid back in July. He also says the cheating is from a past life. But this only dates back to 2011.

I'm 50/50 on ending things....But he has nowhere to go. He is stuck in a Army Reserves contract in this state for another 2 years and is now enrolled in school. I own his vehicle (he was in a bad spot financially during our engagement

Am I out of line in that I feel this lie is HUGE and merits an end? I feel like we're in a soap opera. How can you have 3 kids with 3 different women

**TL;DR:** Denied a kid was his. He cheated

Edit. Thank you everyone for your responses. I'm honestly numb at this point. Terrified to kick him out. Shocked I've let it get this far. But I need to grow the balls &amp; stick up for myself. I am planning to end things when he gets home tonight.

A few months ago my neighbor asked for my Wifi password when his cable modem was on the fritz.  I gave it to him and quickly forgot about it.  About two weeks ago I plugged an external HDD into my router so I could watch a movie on my TV; HDD had music

For the last week my neighbor has been cold to me, ""What's up?""

He went off on me.  Tells me it's because I'm a pervert, we had great rapport before... mowed each other's lawns, his kids would take my dogs for walks when I had to work late, and I had dinner with his family either at my house or theirs 2-3x a month.

We live in Texas, I get that he wants to look out for his family, but... porn is just porn.  While I wouldn't want my sister doing it, it's still fun to watch.

I don't consider the porn that was on there to be anything extreme.  I basically downloaded a bunch of Amateur Allure videos, Sensi Pearl...  There was one video, ironically downloaded by my ex-girlfriend, that was a little light bondage... basically just a girl getting fucked while she was tied to a bed.  I'm not sure what all he saw.

I also had a handfull of pictures from an ex-girlfriend (who was in her late 20s) on there, no action shots... just her topless and a few shots of her on all fours.  We recently broke up, but I'm not sure she was around the neighborhood enough for him to recognize the pictures of her.

Any suggestions for ways to fix this?  I gotta live next to the guy... not willing to sell my house over this.  I'm a single guy in a neighborhood full of families

My ex ended things yesterday morning, he was no longer attracted to me, didn't love me, and he had felt this way for about 6 months. I asked if there was someone else, and he said yes. While I had been out of town this week, he had been hanging out with a girl from our neighborhood whom he met at his job (a local bar).


I understand his point, whatever you want to call it. I had tried to talk to him about it a few times over the past few months, but he always said things were fine, he was just tired, etc. He told me he's been lying to me because he didn't want to have the conversation. That he feels passion for this new girl and that was the catalyst, not the reason for our breakup. I'm not upset it's over, just angry. I'm angry that he had to wait to replace me before he could talk to me. I'm angry because he's not the person I thought he was. I'm angry that I'm hurting and he's off with her


I'm trying to take this opportunity to do what's best for me and get myself back on track, and I may have said some hurtful things like telling him to go fuck himself. He wanted a hug before he left, and I said no. He said he wanted to be friends and hang out in a couple of weeks, but still no. It's not that I don't want to be friends at some point, but I was taken off guard and this was so easy for him.


The worst part for me was that he told me I was never more to him than a companion. I never impacted his life at all.


I feel so lost. I thought I was going to marry him. We talked about moving in together and our future children. He now says that I forced the conversation. I'm upset that I've been lead on.

About 15 minutes into the program, I felt beyond embarrassed because a fair amount of the audience would give us dirty looks.I also felt a bit helpless because I felt that I couldn't just tell her to stfu because I was trying to retain a positive rapport with her mother. 

All I could think was ""OMG SHUT UP!"" I mean, and that drawing attention was the worst thing to do.

About an hour in

**TL;DR.**
My gf embarrassed me at a school awards show and I felt helpless to say anything about it because it was also the first time meeting her mother (who we sat with). Interest was lost. Am I being petty or should I talk to her about it?

**UPDATE:**

I had a conversation with Kate about what happened. Unfortunately it wasn't a one on one conversation because her cousin had chosen to come to school with her

I almost felt bad about saying that because of her reaction, she was all-(then I demonstrated an exaggerated/funny look of disapproval). She nervously laughed. Her cousin then butted in and said ""I think what he's trying to say is that he's not mad at you, but you need to calm your ass down. It's okay to have fun, but you were embarrassing him, and you've done the same to me before."" I said ""I didn't want to be as blunt, and I don't want to seem like I'm coming down on you, but he's right."" Again she gave a kind of defeated expression, I said ""but it's whatever

About an hour later, I also acknowledge that maybe I should lighten up a bit and not get as bent out of shape. She replied by telling me that after thinking about it, she realized how rude she was being and gave a round-about apology. 

After she said what she had to say, rather than the behavior itself (I also acknowlege that I could be wrong). I left it at that and then continued talking to her for about 30 minutes then ended the call. Now that it's all said and done, I think what may be best at this point is to forgive her actions but to make a note of them and be cautious for repeated/similar behavior, and go from there.

About 5 years ago, I’ve expressed my unwillingness to live back in the Midwest – particularly the state where she currently lives.  She also expressed frustration and boredom with living there and living with her parents and “wanted out.”  We’ve spent the last few months having hypothetical discussions of places we should visit and possible places where we could live together and be happy.  We’ve discussed such places as Charlotte, St. Petersburg, Tampa, Charleston, and other major cities where we could both find employment and cities we’d both love living in.


About 3 months into our relationship


Over Thanksgiving, because I want everyone to know how serious our relationship had gotten just in the few months we were officially dating.  The night after Thanksgiving, we went out on a date.  That night – she dropped the bombshell – She’s not willing to move away any time soon, and if I wasn’t willing to move to where she’s at, then this relationship isn’t going to work.  This was the 1st time she ever expressed to me her desire to have me move there.  I told her at that time that she is asking me to do the one thing that I specifically told her that I wasn’t willing to do, but that I cared enough about her that I was willing to mull it over.  I told her at that time that she should understand that I would not be happy to be moving there, and would only agree to it on a short term basis.  She agreed to give me time to think about it.  


Since then


On Friday afternoon, and she wanted to talk to me about it.  She repeated what I said back to her confirming that each item is correct before moving on – 1. I’m still thinking about moving to where she lives and haven’t made the decision to move definitively (CORRECT); 2. Even if I agree to move to her, I wouldn’t be moving happily, and I’d only be willing to move short term (CORRECT); I’m not willing to move there long term, and believe that I would be miserable living there more than a few months or a year (CORRECT).  She said that if that was the case, she sees no future in our relationship, and that I shouldn’t bother visiting her in March.  I ended the conversation with “well

TL;DR: Girlfriend gave me an ultimatum: move to the one state you’ve specifically told me you don’t want to live in again

EDIT:  I'm getting a lot of questions as to why I wouldn't want to live where she lives.  Here's the answer I gave below:  My dislike of living there has nothing to do with her.  My career almost requires me to live in a heavy populated area.  It's not the type of employment that is easily transferable.  I hear about nurses who can pick up and move to any major city and can always find employment at a local hospital.  I can't do that - moving to where she lives would likely mean 12 to 18 months of unemployment, it gets so cold forcing me indoors the entire time. I'm an outdoors person, and if I can't be out in the sun and enjoying it, I get miserably depressed. The culture, politics, social life, and entertainment options are not to my liking. I found very few people that I had anything in common with, and the ""small city"" vibe that even the big cities in the state seem to have. Most important - I didn't like myself or the way I felt when I lived there. I spent my days dreaming of living near a beach or in an interesting city

He told me he didn't have to tell me. He says that he really likes me and that he felt I deserved to know if we're going to try and have a relationship.

He told me he would understand if I walked away and that I was entirely entitled to do that. But he asked that I try to understand that he is not the same person he was then

I was pretty much in shock the whole time he was talking. I tried to ask about what exactly he did and he said he didn't want to talk about it that night. He said that if I would see him again and still wanted to know

He did say however

""You hear a lot about misunderstandings, and ridiculous age of consent traps. This was not my position. I deliberately took advantage of another person. I will not pretend that I am a victim of the system and if imagining that is the only way you can cope with this knowledge it will not work.

This thread got way out of hand. I wanted to clarify things and do a little update.  I got a ton of responses. Most of them were encouraging, ever. 

To answer your questions:


Am I forcing him to do anything? Nope never said I would. Said repeatedly that I wouldn’t. 


Someone wrote…


**but if she makes it so he is not legally liable for the child on any level...
but she can't do that. no 'contract' she could write up would stand up in court. the only way she can let him off the hook is to claim she does not know who the father is (leave him off the birth certificate) and she's not willing to do that. she's outright refused to do that.**


NEVER SAID ANYTHING ABOUT A BIRTH CERITFICATE. This commentor is completely making it up. Never mentioned it ever. Actually
Did he know you didn’t want kids? Yes! Repeatedly told him. Even told him when he proposed that I would never get an abortion. Just like I knew his stance


 Why does his stance matter more than mine? 


Did you purposely not take your birth control? No. He went with me to every single appointment for my BC shot. Every single one. He saw me get the shot. I can’t fake that. And we used a condom every time. 
So how did you get pregnant? Nothing is 100%. Every time you have sex you run a risk. We took the precautions that we could


Someone wrote..

 **They used birth control even though she was seemingly sterile and at this point entering menopause. There is absolutely no way you can blame him for not expecting this.**


Entering menopause or about to enter menopause doesn’t automatically make me sterile. I had numerous pregnancies in the past. Obviously I was far from sterile. 
Then why was she using birth control? For the hell of it? He asked me to. I thought it wasn’t an issue because of the menopause thing and the BC. I figured it wouldn’t do any harm. 


Someone wrote…


**Then she'll have to be a single mum and raise a kid who will most likely get screwed up with deep daddy issues. What a selfish bitch


So all kids raised by single parents have deep daddy issues? Were you raised by a single parent? Do you have deep daddy issues? Why am I a selfish bitch for wanting to bring a kid into this world and love it. I have the money, stable, job, I have the time, I have the effort. I am much more prepared for this than any one else ever.


Someone wrote…


 **I read elsewhere in the thread she may still hit him up for money.
I never wrote that. Someone else assumed that and wrote down that they thought I would. I never said that ever. That actually runs completely contradictory to what I said.** 


**But you are saddling him with a kid that he doesn’t want to exist?** 

So

Someone wrote..


**He trusted someone who was apparently onboard with this.
I made it repeatedly clear to him that I wasn’t on board and would never get an abortion. He never trusted I would. We discussed it at length. He knew I wouldn’t ever.** 


**Why don’t you sign away his rights?** 

Because that is not how the law works. At least not in my state. I can’t just draft a paper and have him sign away that. I couldn’t even get a lawyer to do it because it wouldn’t be legal in my state. For the courts to recognize his right to terminate his parental rights I would have to remarry and have that person adopt the baby. 

**So then remarry and do that?** Yeah. Ok. I will just head right out and marry the first guy I see and have him take over the rights to the kid. It’ll be no problem. Come on. You are adults. You know it doesn’t work like that. 


Someone wrote…

 **you've said repeatedly in this thread, and so does the law, he IS legally responsible. but i wish you would stop portraying yourself as the poor put-upon victim while claiming to be doing nothing that will alter his life in any way.**


Never did I play the victim. It took two people to make this kid. One isn’t in it. Fine. I got this myself. I had a tough history of pregnancy. I think I have a right to be mad at him for asking me to abort it. Just as he has a right to be mad that I would not get an abortion. You made the villain. I never once portrayed myself as a victim here. 


Someone wrote..

**To be fair we only have one side of the story in which she is not going to put herself in a negative light. From what she said the guy is handling it poorly but she hasn't exactly been upfront with him either with something that whether he likes it or not will change his life.**

I actually will provide his side in the comments. Although I suspect people will then call me liar. You have no reason to believe me

**Someone wrote about him not wanting a kid out there ever.** Again


So


We both made ridiculously bad choices in this


I never asked anybody their opinion on the abortion. I wanted to know how to deal with a break and make it easier for my fiancé. So he could find peace and be happy with whatever choice he made. How does that make me a selfish bitch? How does that make me a bad person? 
I got a lot of supportive responses and those were nice. Thank you to everyone how offered real advice and constructive criticism without assuming and filling in the gaps with their own agenda. 

Now for the update..

He called again. This time I confronted him about his constant calls about the abortion. He admitted that was a bit mean and unnecessary. We met up. We talked. Really talked. He is confused and scared and so am I. We talked about why he didn’t want a child. We talked about why I did. We talked about why I didn’t tell him. We talked about our relationship. We talked about what we wanted in the future. We had talked about this all before but never in this context. 

He accepted I would never get an abortion. He was fine with that. After the smoke cleared and with the feelings back to calm he was able to see my reasoning. And I understood his. This man isn’t an ass or villain. Neither am I. We are just too people who now have a situation where a big decision has to be made

He came home that night (last night). To clarify, it’ll take me time. We are waiting until 20 weeks to tell his family so that we don’t get anyone too hopeful. If we miscarry, we won’t try again. We can try adoption later (before I turn 45) If this baby comes to term, they will have the most loving parents ever who will raise it together.     

Things worked out. And I am happy with the results. I am happy that he has found peace and that I don’t have to choose between my future husband and my baby. Until then we both move forward to looking towards a hopeful future. He has actually gotten a little bit excited. Said the kid had to go to his university so he could start a tradition. Although

And more importantly

Again, really taken into account each other’s stance. We messed up. We are human. But it happened and now we are making the best of it. 

I plan to update again near the end of the pregnancy to let everyone know how it went. Also

On a side note: Does anyone know a good place in Washington to get any of those wonderfully amazing pregnancy pants? I want to try them on first. I remember those being so comfy.

From there my family started to branch off into the old wounds that we've caused each other

That's a story that stretches far back. But it boils down to me having poor impulse control as a child (10 or 11) and groping my mother's bottom on a few occasions. Honestly, when she caught me spying on her in the shower. My older sister got involved and together they helped set me right and life was peachy until then. Well, there was an incident where one sibling accused me of spying on my sister while she changed as a joke (I honestly didn't do that, and they had no way of knowing that had been an issue in the past) which set off my mother and infuriated me at life's cruel cosmic irony.

But, if there was a reason, I don't know what it is.

But the other thing, just a drunken non-presence for much of my life, and then a ball-less presence after that) was a survival nut who boarded up the windows and was afraid the government was watching him and that the NWO would start any day.)

Anyway, and told how awful you were makes you feel very powerless. So, I don't remember why, but it occurred to me that if I saw her naked, it would change the dynamic. I wouldn't be powerless. So, I spied on her in the shower. When I was caught, she thought it was just a sex thing

I've always carried so much shame and guilt about this. I mean

So, I guess). Secondly, that she brought up what she must know is an awful, shame-ridden part of my life so easily. She should know better too. She was molested as a child (I'm aware that my antics couldn't have been received well, considering this fact. I felt even more shame when I learned about that) and my father would just casually remind her that she was ""no saint"" and shit like that. She has never forgiven my father for that treatment. Eventually, the argument breaks and after I tell her that I'm furious, and that she's shit and no better than my dad. She counters that I'm the shitty person, but I've had enough. I tell her not to come by later and apologize for her horseshit once she's pulled herself together (her favorite tactic: Say awful things and then take them back while making sure you take blame for participating in the argument).

I've been thinking about this all day. I don't think I'm a bad person. I'm aware this is a throwback to the way she would treat me as a child by trying to convince me I'm worthless, if you ever watch ""A Single Man"" you'll see a Colin Firth-version of my problems with suicide: so messy!) but I didn't kill myself. That was something I suffered alone because I wouldn't share that with my family (and yeah, like I chump I thought about how awful it would be for them if I died) and none of them seemed to notice or care what I was going through. As a matter of fact, they did notice, but just called me an asshole for the was I behaving.

I'm a good person

But

EDIT: Thank you for all your support everyone. You've helped me work through the feeling of guilt. Knowing that I wasn't alone in my actions

Clarifying a few things: I'm currently living at home. I committed to moving out and getting my shit together a few years back, a year and a half in total) which completely set me back. So, moving out in the immediate to near future is not possible for me. However, it is a priority. I think I'll have to make what space I can in my life while I'm here and I'll be civil with my parents. But I know it's different. My mother last any last vestiges of respect from me yesterday. But, maybe I'm weird, I can still be civil (actually, more civil) with people I don't respect/feel close to.

I want to go into therapy. I was convinced that after I only had a very weak (like the notion ""hey, and I'm going to travel more out of my shitty small town, so It's something I'm going to make a priority. Once again, thank you all.

EDIT 2: I'm not going to seek therapy with her, and if I get to the point where I completely understand and forgive all that they've done, I don't think I'll want to spend much time with them then either.

I was with my ex for 9 months. It ended 3 years ago followed by another 8ish months of contact after she cheated on my and strung me along. I cut her out of my life completely. My fiancee and I met over 5 years ago and started dating a few months after I quit contacting the ex. Out relationship is fantastic and I have no worries about it. We've been engaged for a few months now and living together for almost a year.

Here's where things get tricky. At the beginning of June, my ex recently found out we were engaged. She sent a LONG rambling letter talking about how ""emotionally unstable"" I am and how big of a mistake it would be for my fiancee to marry me. Wtf? It was a long diatribe of the most self serving, arrogant bullshit I've ever had the displeasure of reading. In the letter she made up a lot of things. Such as during our relationship I said I bought an engagement ring...no.

My fiancee and I spoke about the letter of course. She knows that it's bullshit and trusts me(rightfully so) and blocked the ex on fb. Ex went on to hang out with my friend who introduced us out of the blue and tried to stir up more shit.

I don't give a shit about my ex. She's a despicable indiviual who warrants absolutely no respect from me. However, but it makes me boil that this girl is trying to cause me more trouble after all the shit she put me through.

1375861193.0,1jvcpc,My[18F] boyfriend [22M] wants me to meet his ex girlfriend[27F],belenoflove,175,50,52,"I apologize for the wall of text. Writing this has helped me to sort out what I'm feeling into a more orderly fashion

OUR RELATIONSHIP:
My boyfriend and I have been dating for about 4 months, open and generous person. We communicate effectively and haven't fought; any time an issue (only very small things so far) has come up it has been dealt with in a positive, constructive manner. He has demonstrated his commitment to our (still fairly new) relationship, and I haven't experienced any jealousy due to his friendship with other girls. In short, I feel strongly that I can trust him, and our relationship has been very positive and fulfilling thus far.



THEIR HISTORY:
My boyfriend dated his ex for about 2 years, and she remains one of his closest friends. In my last relationship, many fights (and my jealousy issues) were propagated from my boyfriend's friendship with his ex, but my experience with my current one has been very different. I haven't felt threatened by their friendship, probably because he is open about it, yet doesn't talk about her too often; it seems that he treats her the same way he would treat any other platonic friend, which I can't find fault in.



THE CURRENT SITUATION:
My boyfriend's ex lives quite far from where we do, and to spend time with the two of us together.

At first I wasn't opposed to the idea, we've had conversations about it and I can go in to further detail if necessary), he told me she said she still feels that she has ""doors to close"" because the past year has been difficult and she hasn't found ""anything close to what they had"". I imagine this feeling for her is also intensified given the fact that he is now involved with me, yet she still hasn't found a new love interest. The way my boyfriend put it, is that he thinks she needs to see him in the life he's living now in order to impress the present upon her, and to help her to stop idealizing the past and find closure. She also told him she is genuinely happy for our relationship and doesn't want to cause any awkwardness or resentment due to her visit.



MY PROBLEM:
The more I think about this situation

1. While I fully trust my boyfriend, but I feel that it may be overwhelming for me to meet her in person and see them together. Especially because I strongly suspect she doesn't view him the same way he views her; perhaps she wants to move on, and is making an effort to continue a normal platonic friendship with him, but I keep getting the feeling that a lot of romantic feelings are still present on her end. While I don't perceive her as a threat to my relationship, or feel that she would try to undermine it, I simply don't wish to see or experience another person having those feelings for my boyfriend.

2. My boyfriend practically said that he encouraged her to come visit so that she could get realize the past is the past, which I feel shouldn't be necessary if I trust my boyfriend to be firm and not cross any boundaries. On top of that I think it would probably make the visit that much less enjoyable for her, to see her ex with another girl, and I don't want to make her sad. If she is going to get closure, can't she do that without having to see me in the flesh?

3. There is always the other option that this visit won't bring her closure at all

3. The age difference makes this situation even harder navigate. My boyfriend is the median between us. I still consider myself a girl, just hard to handle. And both of us will be reaching out to my boyfriend for support. Doesn't he owe that support to me in this event?

4. If I don't meet her

Also, and said he would gladly make other arrangements if that was the case. At first I didn't think I had a problem with it but now I'm unsure. I do trust him to be faithful and that he doesn't want to be involved with her in that way any longer, but perhaps it would help me to feel more comfortable, and would probably be better for her anyways so that she may sort out her thoughts in a removed environment.



IN CLOSING:
I really just am not sure what to do. It doesn't help that my boyfriend can get along with just about anyone in just about any situation, emotions will be heightened no matter what, there's no way around it. So what do I do? Is this too much for my boyfriend to ask of me, in the early stages of a relationship? Do I suck it up and try my best? Am I over thinking all of this? Any advice is welcome, I've never really been in a position like this before.

ALSO I haven't had a chance to express all this to him yet

TL;DR Boyfriend of 4 months wants me to meet his ex who he had a 2 year relationship with and is 10 years my senior. They had an amicable breakup and maintain a close friendship; he sees her like a sister. Soon she will be visiting for a week. She needs closure, but I have no idea what to do. Help?

**EDIT: I have read all of your comments, as it could create problems and be more heartache than it's worth, or for meeting her since it would demonstrate my maturity and commitment to the relationship, and she is a part of his life which I need to accept. I continue to find validity and sound advice in both of these kinds of comments; I'm still leaning towards not meeting her, but these comments have given me the idea of possibly meeting her for a very short amount of time, simply to make my presence known and have met her so I don't have to awkwardly avoid her all week and possibly do it later on down the line. I'm still not sure about this idea though. I suspect it will be easier to come to a conclusion after I talk to my boyfriend, who I think will try to be supportive of what's best for me and our relationship, I will continue to read your comments; your 3rd party perspective is invaluable.

Thank you all for the advice. It really helped put it in perspective. 

So we told him.  We had to do it online because he doesn't really like meeting up without it being planned.  We managed to get her to give our fake profile guy her skype name.  We decided it would be good to get a screenshot of her to prove to James* that it was her we were speaking to.  
We compiled everything into a folder and added him to our group conversation.  He was on skype already

What we said:  Hi James. We are sorry but we have betrayed your trust in a most horrendous way. We have found some things we think you should see.  We are here if you need to talk and we are truly

We also sent the folder.  He never replied to us. 

We assume he is now confronting her. We wait patiently

First, and your replies may very well have saved my SO's life, and saved our baby from losing her father.  

It's been about a month since I posted, but given how many times I'd tried to leave before, I felt it was the best thing I could do.  

My SO called me as soon as he found out I was gone.  I think it goes without saying that he was livid pissed.  I had to convince him not to come to my parents' house and drag me back home

It turns out that he has Type II Diabetes, and it eventually led to the strokes.  Looking back, it probably should have been the first thing that occurred to me.  He has a strong family history of strokes on his father's side of the family, and diabetes on his mother's.  I knew this for a long time, but it just didn't click that it could be the cause of his dramatic change in behavior.  I feel like shit that I let it go on for so long without urging him to get to a doctor sooner.  

Since we found out, changed his diet significantly, started exercising, and is taking insulin and medication for high blood pressure.  He's also going to therapy sessions for people who have been victims of strokes--from what I understand, it's something similar to rehab.  It seems to be helping with his moods, but the jury is still out on whether it's because of the medical treatments or because he wants me to come home--maybe it's both.   

I'm about a month from my due date now, and I'm scared that if I move back too soon, he'll lose his motivation to keep working to get better.  I guess we'll see in the next couple weeks.

- I check her phone/email
- I constantly look at her facebook
- I try to find out where she is and what she's doing at ALL times
- I live down the street from her, I go down the street to see if she really is home.

I always rationalized this by telling myself that it's because of how our relationship first started and a few things that's going on that's making me question her.

- When we first began dating, while her and I began courting (do people still use that word?) but I thought that once we got together, it would stop.  We started dating, and she one day told me she was hanging out with a few friends, turns out she and the guy and his friends went out, where they talked about her feelings for him.  When he asked if she was dating anyone, by reflex, but didn't make me feel any better.  They don't talk/hang out anymore, and those ""what ifs"" stay with me as well.

- Her old crush.  She had a crush on this guy almost a year ago, to this day, however, they talk regularly.  This is all on me, however, because nothing is going on between them, but still

- Coworker/boss.  This guy was interested in her when she first started working there, then coffee, etc. etc.  I told her that something felt off about this guy, and it took her a while, but she, too realized, that he didn't invite anyone else out for lunch/breakfast, weird suspicious feelings linger whenever he calls/texts/emails for work.

- Her best guy friend.  She had a best guy friend, text regularly, call regularly, and at times, video chat with one another.  I was ok with all of it until she told me, a few weeks into the relationship, that they had hooked up a few times.  He is still and has been in a relationship for the past 5 - 6 years, it means nothing

Whew.  So with all that said, however, I'm at this weird lukewarm place where some days, I look at myself and think, ""She's too awesome to hurt me.  She would never,"" and I move on, but there are days where I think back on those issues and it puts me in a weird dark place.

A few days after her ""I don't know"" text, I gave her a call and asked her to go to lunch. I was sick of wondering about everything and figured lunch would give us an opportunity to see each other and talk things out.

We met at a half way point and ate lunch. While things seemed somewhat normal, I'd give her more time. Then she dropped the bombshell of ""I still love you and want you in my life, but I'm not sure if I'm still IN love with you."" While it hurt, I believe that feelings like that are normal in a long relationship and can be worked on. We continued to talk for a few minutes and then she said that she had to leave to meet one of her girlfriends that lived close by. She told me to call her the next day and we would continue to talk things out and figure out what to do next. At this point, I knew what was going to happen, but I wanted the closure that talking may bring. 

The next day, but I agreed. I wanted some answers. 

During that week, I saw some signs. She was secretive about her phone at lunch, vague about plans that she had, and had some mysterious new guy friends that she never had mentioned before. I decided that I had to find out about that when we talked, too. 

So the day arrived and I drove the hour to go see her. I got in her apartment and noticed pictures of us and pictures that she had drawn for me were taken off of her fridge. I already knew I was going to get dumped, we sat down and talked. She mentioned reasons that she wasn't happy with our relationship that she had never verbalized before, yet wasn't willing to try to work on things and give it another shot. I found this to be frustrating but eventually I got the point and put my shoes on to leave. Then I decided I had to ask if there was someone else. 

When she didn't immediately answer, but it was apparent that they were doing more than just holding hands or kissing at a bar and I also could tell that they had been talking for longer than she was saying. She said she wanted the break because she was scared she would cheat if she hadn't. In my opinion, she should have broken it off completely instead of the ""break"" bullshit. It also hurts to know that she's throwing away a three year relationship for someone she met a few months ago. She said that she saw things in him that she wasn't getting from me, but she never even communicated those things to me. She also admitted that he was the real reason she wasn't willing to give it a second shot with me, even though she had previously claimed that she wanted to be single for a while. It hurts that she wasn't going to tell me about him until I asked. 

So I gave her a hug, but I did not respond. I have decided no contact is the best way to go for a couple of reasons. First, it will not prolong my pain and drag things out. Second, (and you may see that I am still in a little bit of denial with this one) if I keep talking to her it could push her more towards the new guy as well as make me seem needy, and no one likes that. From my experience, whatever she has with this new guy is likely to not last and by not talking to her it may make her realize what she misses. I am holding out no hope for her to crawl back, however. Lastly

I was pretty broken up about it at first, but now is not the time and I must focus on myself, not her. At the very least, I know that this woman will be in my life at some point as a friend, it will just require me to get completely over her first. This will also give me time to focus on improving myself.

**LAST EDIT: Seriously, but I already feel lighter.  Time to put this whole ordeal behind me and focus on my future with someone better.**

I'm honestly at the end of my rope... apologies if this is disjointed

Quick background.

My GF and I started dating in high school.  We took each other's virginities, unwilling to do long distance. 

During college, but I was doing the same thing.  After 2 years of this, we reconnected over the summer and started dating exclusively again until today. 

So on to the problems...

Over these past 3 or so years she's cheated multiple times.  A couple of times she was drinking with friends and ""blacked out"" and ended up waking up in some guys bed (I do believe this is what actually happened).  Okay, texts, and even found reference to a skype call that she made to an old hookup buddy. It's gotten to the point where I actually don't remember the amount of times she's cheated.  

The worst part is, so no matter if she thinks she deleted something if I hunt around long enough I can tell what she's been up to).  

After the first time I told her that as long as she was honest with me

For the past week or so I get a bad feeling and decide to check her phone while she's sleeping.  Usually

So why don't I just dump her on her ass?  We've been together for so long, she's cuter than heck, and her family is amazing.  I have always believed we were as close as someone could get to a ""soulmate"".

Also

Every time I catch her she's extremely remorseful and promises to stop.  I wish I hadn't believed her. 
She can never give me an answer as to why she does it.  She just says ""I don't know, I want to be with you""  

Reddit, and I think I'm reasonably attractive.  I've got a great job, I'm driven to be financially successful.  I treat her like a princess.  Every time we're together, she spoils me rotten, we have a ton of fun and are totally fine with just cuddling for hours.  She basically appears to be the perfect girlfriend.  We openly talk about engagement, and make plans for the future.

But I can't trust her anymore.  I considered not telling her I found the messages and installing an SMS tracker on her phone to see how extensive this really is.  But she could be sending emails, I can't possibly track them all, plus I don't have regular access to her laptop.  

Of course

And I have no way of knowing if this guy I just found out about was the only one recently.  Could have been more.  I found the messages and left her place in a rage while she was still sleeping.  Left her a really long nasty text

I'm at work, and I haven't talked to her yet.  I told her last time this happened (it was dirty fb messages with old FWB last time), that if I ever found something I'd leave her right then and there.  Deep down I know I need to break up with her, but I can't figure out if I'm afraid I'll never find someone I click with as well as her.  I'm desperately clinging on to something that's normally bliss, punctuated by these hellish episodes.

Maybe I'm just chickenshit.

He has no girlfriend, really. He's so close, but so fucking far away, as I'm miles under his niveau, his requirements are hight as fuck. 

I'm neclecting my studies to spend every minute with him
Plus I can't talk about it with any of my friends, that otherwise it can't be healthy for me.

 He doesn't seem to notice my situation, he just doesn't love them. 

Most people meeting us think we are a pair -we even hold hands in public and have no problem with resting our heads on each others crotch. But he (and I) do this with others as well

I really wished he found a girl ( or boy) soon

Sometimes it's really hard to not see an innuendo in everything he does -he acts really jealous when someone shows interest in me
I can't even say he's beautiful, his lips, the vene above his eyes that shows only when his bloodpressure is hight, his intelligence and his caring of others, his empathy (beside the before mentioned blind spot of noticing) really do it for me. 

Now reddit, or do you think looks don't matter in this case?

1341967099.0,wcx43,Gf unhappy with my living situation (I share an apt. w/ 1 guy and 2 girls),I_am_yonkers,137,20,86,"Hey guys

I (male: 21) moved into a new place a month or 2 ago sharing the apartment w/ a couple as well as another girl. I had discussed this w/ my gf (20) before moving in and she said that it was fine especially considering it was super cheap and I loved the place. But now, seeing my roommates, hearing my roommate's names etc. I can understand her uneasiness about me living in the same apartment as a single girl, but I've made countless efforts to make my gf more comfortable with my situation. I try to avoid 1 on 1 situations w/ the single roomie, I rarely even sit on the same couch as her, when I walk to the shower I make sure to go fully clothed rather than just in shorts or something like that. I've also repeatedly asked her what I can do to make the situation better, different ways I should have acted. Her response is only ever that the way I was acting was fine

Now here's my dilemma: I recognize that pretty much the only way she's going to be content is if I move out. And if I was a shining white knight and a perfect boyfriend, I'm not really sure.

It might also be prudent to note that she hangs out with male friends quite often (including one's she's dated) who hug her, but I don't have a huge problem with that. My problem is that I've had absolutely no physical contact (let alone a relationship) with my roomie, yet she's still considered a big threat. BTW my roommate is super nice to my gf all the time and tries to include her in things and make her feel welcome in our apartment.

any ideas on how I should carry on from here on out would be greatly welcomed. Unfortunately this doesn't seem like an area where compromise is working out that well. I'm honestly not sure if I'm being reasonable or just being a dick.

1341774324.0,w8bu1,I cannot forgive my wife for her one night stand,Veridian800,163,45,384,"Wife and I have been with one another for 12 years. Two kids. I'm 33 and my wife is 32. Kids are 5 and 3. Solid marriage throughout with a few bumps here and there but nothing too severe. In January my wife went on a weekend trip with some girlfriends of hers. Ends up getting drunk and sleeping with another guy. Doesn't tell me. I find out a couple weeks later when I see a message on her phone. She ends up confessing after I confront her. Swears its the first and only time its happened and nothing like it will ever happen again. Furious does not even begin to touch on how I feel. We have a terrible fight and I decided to move out. It felt like the best choice. I hated my wife at the time and I didn't want to do something too hurtful. Seeing her everyday would have been too hard. 

I don't know what her ONS did to me but it changed me. I stopped really caring about being a good husband (and probably a woman. good father) and just became more selfish. I was a really good husband to her and I didn't deserve to be cheated on. I moved out and started to act single. I had two one night stands of my own between February and April and started to date another 

In May my wife and I finally talk and she convinces me to at least start coming by our home more often since the kids were missing me. Once I started to going back to spending more time with my kids my wife and I started to reconnect with one another. My wife and I basically started dating again and we are doing better. I agreed to move back in last week and I broke up with my girlfriend. 

The problem for me is I cannot forgive my wife. I still have love for her but I just think of her as a whore. I can only imagine some drunk guy railing my wife. Having sex with my wife is not fun. I can't stand to see her face when we are intimate. I feel bad when we argue because I've said some mean things to her. I wish I could move on but I haven't been able to. 

I still want to be married to my wife I guess. Its better than the alternative of divorce and the related expenses. But I'm not in any way loyal or in love with my wife. I don't know why I can't forgive her or move on. She is sorry and hasn't done anything like that since. She says it was one mistake and she will never do anything like it again. 

**TL:DR My wife had an affair. We are trying to reconcile after I moved out and I can't move on or forgive her.**

**EDIT:** I do want to stay married and I'm more asking this for help in forgiving her. I want to try to forgive my wife and fix our marriage. Obviously people are free to post whatever advice they want and I appreciate all the advice but I would prefer advice that is more detailed than just ""leave her"" or ""divorce"". There are two little boys who I have to think of as well. I can't be super selfish and just leave at their expense. 

**EDIT2:** Thought I should add some more details and information. I'm almost in the uncomfortable position of defending my wife with some of the comments. I didn't think it was possible to be angrier than me but I guess it is. We had been arguing a lot for the month or two before her ONS about expenses and a health issue of my younger son's. There was a lot of stress and drama over that. My wife says this was a reason she had her ONS along with her being overly drunk and the other guy being persistent. My wife didn't get his number and they never had an affair or anything like that. 

When I confronted her my wife didn't deny it and admitted it. Since then she has been a really good wife by any stretch. I was horrible to her after the ONS. I yelled at her. Called her a whore/slut/cunt/etc. I went through a terrible phase and that is why I moved out. Because I was scared I was going to hurt her. 

When I was moved out I told her I was going to be single and I essentially shoved the new relationships in her face. It was petty. I did it for revenge. I don't think it was cheating and my wife doesn't count it as cheating. I didn't even talk to her kindly for almost three months. My wife did not date anyone or see anyone during our separation. I am 98% sure this was her first and only affair. Obviously I can't be certain but it is so unlike her. She has been sorry and remorseful since it came out. 

I wouldn't have moved back in if she wasn't. Its not that I hate to see her face. That is only when we are having sex. I do have love for my wife and I care about her a lot still. We are actually pretty good and happy most of the time. Our home is not like a warzone and our boys have been so happy that I've moved back in. I want to do what is best for them and I think my wife and I staying together is best for them. I think and I hope and I pray that my love for my wife can return. **I posted this hoping someone could help me in forgiving my wife and help me fall back in love with her. I really don't want to go. I want to repair our marriage and keep our family together.** I know I'm not perfect and I have some blame in this. And I know I've become an uglier person because of her affair with my selfishness and anger and I want to get beyond that.

My husband and I were married for 17 years. We both went to the same college at separate times but somehow manage to meet while I was still in school. We fell in love immediately and I knew I had found my soul mate. Fast forward two incredible years of dating and we were married right after I graduated.

Tragically

We weren't the only ones who were grieving over my husband's absence. My husband's best friend, I could tell that he was just as heart broken as the rest of us for losing his very good friend.

My son and I were living in a big home by ourselves which made our grieving process worse. About 2 months after my husband's passing

We have an extra room in our home that my husband had turned into an office-away-from-the-office kind of set up. I offered to clear some stuff out of there for Mike to have his own room to sleep in and he declined saying that he would rather take the couch then have anything moved from in there. 

One night, I reach a point where I can clearly hear sobbing downstairs in the living room den. I quietly reach the bottom and peer in and see Mike sobbing and tearing up looking at a picture of him and my husband.

I immediately started breaking down and hurried away so he didn't see me. I didn't bring it up to him or anyone else until last month. I don't know why I felt the need to tell him that I understood his pain and that I'm not overlooking it. I told him that I saw him crying that one night and it broke my heart to see him that way. He said he didn't want me to pity him and just wanted me to let him help me and my son as long as we need it. 

He leaves town that weekend for a business trip and would return that following Monday. But oddly

Long story short

About a week and a half ago, and again began to kiss. This time, it got so emotional and passionate that we ended up in my bedroom. I thought my son would be out the entire day as planned but he had forgotten his cell phone being charged in my room with my charger.

So as you can imagine

That night, no, no, maybe). It really kills me to see him hate me like he does right now.

I am completely crushed and upset that my son is feeling hurt and sad because of what I did. At the same time

I met him in March of last year and we ended up getting pregnant in June.  We decided that we didn't want to terminate and would like to stay together.  So things are going rather awesomely.  He is an extremely sweet and thoughtful man who does everything he can for me.  I move in with him and we're very happy.  

I start to notice that he tends to keep his phone away from me.  I ask him if there was a reason for it, but apparently I'm more computer savvy than him.  I proceed to find lots of 12chan stuff, videos of young (12ish) girls dancing very sexually on youtube, and just lots of searches looking for sexy young girls.  Obviously I freak a bit and confront him.  He proceeds to lie to me, thinking that there was no way that I could know all that I know.  He said he looked once because he was curious (referencing 12chan), but I know he's been doing it for months and yea...  He eventually gave up trying to lie and said he was embarrassed, but it keeps happening (the looking at youtube vids).  I told him I wouldn't look through his history again

I find that he's had a kind of love affair with a girl who is 17 and they've been planning to marry each other for years.  Ok...  so he was attracted to a girl who (I'm guessing from the timeline) was 13 when he was 22.  Apparently they stopped having their ldr sometime before I met him

To the best of my knowledge he hasn't looked at this stuff or talked to young girls for a long while

So now here I am, I can't support myself and will have to move in with my father which will be an even worse living arrangement since he abused me when I was very young and I don't trust him around my child.  I have no where else to go.  Please don't say I'm stupid if I stay, I know, this is what makes me angry/sad as well.    

We are going to counseling next week because I told him that I'm constantly angry at him and very sad, 2 more years and then I'll be out.  Or am I just a crazy, insecure person?

Then tells me it's nothing, then she tells me she would probably sleep with him if she wasn't in a relationship, and that they've been sending ""can't wait to sex you"" messages as lately as this summer, although she says he sent them and she just agreed to it by which I reckon she means she wasn't graphical about it. But it's hard to say, I didn't really ask how many mails or what was written, this is information I don't even want. 
So obviously this situation is uncomfortable, ""if it's ok for me"". So we have a huge fight, the worst and probably only serious one in our rather short relationship.  

I've been with manipulative people before, reduces complex issues to a simple matter of trust me or don't trust me, tries to change definitions of words in her favor (""I didn't mislead you, he *is* _just_ a friend""). At the same time, I don't think she is manipulating. I think she's awesome, kindhearted.

**Background:**


Me, engaged and wedding in less than 3 months. He's been with 20+ people, I've been with 4. We both watch porn regularly and I have no issue with it, I encourage he does it when I'm not home. We are also very active where we still have sex sometimes 2-3 times a day and usually sex or BJ happen 7 days a week. I am quite attractive as well, fit, young, big boobs

I've always been attracted to girls, we talked when I met him at 18 about this but a lot has changed since then.


At around our 5 year mark the topic of threesomes came up since it had yet to happen. I was maybe open to trying it if I got to pick the girl and it wasn't anyone we would have to see again (I thought Vegas would be perfect for this). He was not ok with that idea, especially someone you have more than just physical attraction to. We came to a standstill and it really hurt our relationship for a while knowing he was interested in sleeping with my friends but wouldn't consider having me pick someone else out. I felt like dirt for sometime. But life went on and we didn't talk about it much anymore, we got engaged, and I thought everything was great.


**Current:**


Yesterday he went out and did a bunch of wedding stuff with me and in the evening he mentioned wanting to go to the strip club. I wasn't really feeling it but decided lets go have some fun, I am usually the one that doesn't want to leave and we were having a great time.


A few hours in (we're both pretty drunk) I bring up how we should do this more often and sometime invite a couple we know out there with us (they go too) because that would be fun. His response to this is to mention another couple to me and bring up how they do three somes. I asked what that had to do with anything and he just stared at me. I mentioned how if it ever happened it would NOT be with a friend or someone we knew or had to see again and that I would get to pick the girl, esp when we were out in public and I was trying my best to have fun and do something nice for him. A big WTF moment for me. 


So I asked him a really stupid question I should have waited until sober to ask. 1) What happens if I never want to do it or you never are ok with me picking the girl, not have relationship talk while out. He wants to leave but he is still too drunk so I say we need to wait get some water and sober up before leaving. We live really close by but even a few blocks of driving is not ok if he's too drunk.


In this time I get a dance from a girl


We head home after a while. I act chill even though I am pissed


We talked today. Turns out his friend told him last week about how him and his girlfriend do it all the time and he has gone to bed bitter and jealous all week that I am not more open. He wants to try it before we get married but is still not ok with the stranger. I do NOT ask for names of the people he is interested in and tell him no that is way too much pressure and really unfair to me. He did say he will be ok if it never happens and said he was just drunk when he couldn't answer that question last night. I don't believe him since this has come up before and he let his friend mentioning it get him in a funk all week. Clearly not something he is just going to forget about. Also want to mention he is really trying hard to apologize and make up for being an idiot about this last night


Now to me, and its left me wanting to call off the wedding. I may never want it to happen (we watched good friends go through a divorce a few years ago as they tried this after getting married and the guy kept insisting on more and more of her friends and it got bad). I *might* be ok with it at some point but again, ONLY if I get to pick the girl. All this pressure is killing me and making it really unappealing. 


I have to go to his moms house now to work on my wedding dress and I have just been a crying mess all day. It kills me to think he's been laying next to me in bed all week thinking about how he wants to fuck other people and getting upset with me. We should be happy right now and enjoying our engagement and not letting friend's ruin it. I feel so completely inadequate too now

New post:

Hi /r/relationships , slow process. A lot of people on this subreddit update as quickly as a day after their post with their decision and with some results. I really respect their decisiveness.

I also appreciated everyone's responses. I really felt those responses that said I was a ""doormat"". In response to those I discovered a book about [""Nice Guy Syndrome""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_More_Mr._Nice_Guy_%28book%29) (there is a free version available online somewhere). It doesn't all apply to me directly but there are some parts I am using to reconsider my outlook on things. For example

A lot of people stressed that SHE needs to make the effort to make up for what she did. I agree. I tried researching what it takes to fix marriage after infidelity and I found a very good resource in a [stickie](http://talkaboutmarriage.com/coping-infidelity/32002-welcome-tam-cwi-newbies-please-read.html) of another forum that has a lot of good basic information about how to think about infidelity. I encourage anyone dealing with infidelity especially in marriage to read this. (I can't say anything about how good this forum's community is

A few people provided some positive encouragement and gave me the courage to try and save this marriage. It's my decision and I appreciate the support.

First of all, shares her emotions with me when positive and with negative, and I have had a lot more out-pour of my own emotion to her, even more than before this whole mess. I have more open access to her e-mails, etc.

We have started counseling. It's actually a team of two counselors, the expense makes us reluctant to go that often.

I think the counseling session this weekend will be different the previous ones, it takes time, it takes open communication, and that we have to confront each other when we have negative feelings. I will try to update again later about counseling.

Positive developments: We have been spending a lot of time together. We have good times

Negative: She is distant sometimes. She says ""I'm not confident about my feelings."" It is at these times that I feel the most that she no longer loves me. She really swings between the two.

Divorce: I have come to terms that we might have to get a divorce. Of course it would be extremely painful but I am ready. We are both financially independent and there would be some logistical issues (moving, like I said, she is being faithful and honest, we are going to counseling, I still love her. If we can get our emotions figured out, we still might have a future together.

I guess that is pretty much my situation now! I have no specific requests for advice or anything, other questions, etc are welcome.

1366045319.0,1ced9x,My girlfriend [25F] and I[23F] are trying to figure out how to approach our roommate [29F] of 4 months about keeping common courtesy boundaries.,extremelyconfused,166,33,72,"So my gf and I moved into a townhouse in January because we wanted to pay less than we were paying for an apt of our own. The girl we live with owns the townhouse

As soon as we moved in we realized it wasn't occasional of her boyfriend to come by. He basically lives here with her and doesn't have a job at the moment but we didn't and don't mind him at all

Two months ago our roommate was out of town and told us that her bf and his friends were gonna hang out in the living room, Saturday and Sunday of all night partying. They were playing pong, playing the music obnoxiously loud till 5 am. We asked them a few times to turn it down and they did but it interrupted our sleep for those few nights. That monday I asked my roommate to let us know the next time they planned on partying since it really wasn't just a quiet living room hang out as she had originally told us. She said she was sorry and didn't realize that they were going to do all they did and that she'd notify us the next time they planned on getting together and if it would turn into a night of partying.

Within the last 2 months this has happened several times. My gf and I will be woken up at 3 am or 4 am by either the music or her boyfriends friends yelling/being loud

Then on Easter Sunday she had people over. Not like a family get together, get the fuck away from me"" literally right next to our bedroom door for half an hour till they went to their room and fought for a while (their room is next to ours and we can hear through the walls). We never said anything because we know alcohol can bring out another side of people and also because we know it's embarrassing to realize what you've done the next day. They never brought it up either but avoided talking to us for a few days, out of embarrassment I think.

So this weekend comes on by, just a get together. Same thing happens, loud music and yelling that literally woke us up at 4 am. I was so frustrated at this point that I called my roommate, she didn't answer so I texted her saying ""Roommate, someone's yelling so loud that it just woke me and (insert gfs name), can you ask them to calm down? it's 5 in the morning. And if you don't mind, we definitely need to sit down this week to talk to you"". I got no reply but within 5 minutes it quieted down. No music and no more people being loud. 

Saturday when we woke up our roommate was out of the house already so I texted her asking if we could sit down to talk that night or Sunday and she said she couldn't saturday night and sunday night she had plans. So I asked about Monday and she said she couldn't because she had to bring her mom to the airport and wouldn't be back till 11. So I said how about Sunday morning? (yesterday) and she said Sure! Lets talk Sunday Morning...well sunday morning comes around and she's not home..I text her asking to let us know when she'll be around so we can talk. I get a reply from her at 1PM saying she stayed at a friends house and can't talk till Wednesday. I found it to be inconsiderate and told her so. No reply.


TLDR: Roommate said she wasn't partier. Parties a lot. Blows us off when we ask to talk to her about it.

[For those who don't know

So I've been seeing my girlfriend for about 6+ months now.  Things were incredible at first, and really started to connect.  A few months down the line, we became exclusive, and I was a lucky guy to have such a smart, mature, but fun girl to be around.  We'd go out and have fun with my friends or her friends, spend time together at my place

And then things started changing. 

So she is Korean, etc.  It was agreed upon that the accepted cultural norm for guys in Korea is to not care for brains at all, and sometimes even as extreme as ""the dumber the girl is, the better"". She just has to look pretty and act cutesy, with lots of ""Aegyo"".  We didn't say the word ""aegyo"" specifically, but it's clear that we were on train of thought.   

Before I knew it, but Aegyo started to come out.  Now I didn't really mind at first, or really notice it TOO heavily.  It was just sort of there, and I figured it was part-Aegyo, and part-goofiness.  I could relate, we were very happy together, and I was also really happy.  

Then it just started to become more and more Aegyo from her.  A month had passed

I didn't know how to make it stop, as gently as humanly possible while conveying that it was becoming a serious issue for me. 

The results weren't good, saying that she didn't know what she was doing wrong, and that it was a core part of her personality....

I realize how sensitive of an issue this is, but after some days of thinking, she seriously said that she ""doesn't feel its a negative aspect of herself"".  She said she'd make efforts to change/tone it down, but truly doesn't see how it's a negative trait to act in that way...which scares me more than anything.  

I'm not asking her to get rid of her giddiness and fun on all levels of course

But ultimately if this just continues and more Aegyo comes out

I can put up with small amounts here and there, intelligent, well-spoken, sexy girlfriend just turn into an overbearing Aegyo girlfriend shouldn't be part of getting more comfortable....at least that's how I feel.  Is there anything else I can say or do to give her my perspective more on the situation?

1363095564.0,1a59tx,[UPDATE] [20F] Fiance's [20M] mom [37F] just sent us a message threatening to take us to court over our daughter [5months F] because she's too lazy to come over and see her.,Crazymil,152,33,29,"Original: http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1a2ph3/20f_fiances_20m_mom_37f_just_sent_us_a_message/

She sent more messages

She ended up writing messages to my mums phone to us, without even asking us if she could come over, and she sent these messages at around 2am.

The main message she sent (I will decode her horrible spelling again) is this:

""As for not letting me be a Nanna to my own granddaughter (She says this like she has some eternal right that goes over the parents rights), You are ALL neglecting her. I don't know what i did to you both but (SO) i thought you would have the balls to stand up to (Me) and say hey that's my mum. I will tell my mum to take back the birthday presents she bought you."" (Says this like blackmail, ""Oh if you don't come over i won't give you birthday presents.""

Last message she sent was ""Goodbye

Yeah

So yes

SO and myself figured out that the reason she's so upset? Is because grandparents can now get paid money from the government for ""Babysitting."" and this is what she wants.

SO rang her last night, and the smoking.  She said she threatened to do that because she was upset we were leaving.  SO replied ""You're not upset now and you just threatened to do it.""  She got angry, he told her to fuck off and she hung up, then she sent us the ""I won't bother"".

So we're just not going to even bother with her anymore or respond to calls

She wants to be greedy and threaten to take us to court over her laziness? Fine

We also expect her to be ringing in the next week/fortnight to ask when she can see our daughter

Well, her principal confronted her and Lee screamed at the principal ""DON'T YOU KNOW MY GRAMPA JUST DIED"" (for the record it was my father's father who died, and Lee had only met him maybe twice). She wept tears of remorse over stealing and promised she would stop. At one point she was literally packing her bags to leave but then had a change of heart and wrote us an apology note and promised to change if only we would keep her. So we gave her a ""fresh start"". And then a week later we found her stealing more things. And it's not like she's just USING the things, either. She leaves the lids off of makeup jars and creams. They're stuffed with dirty cotton balls or completely dried out. 

Throughout everything I have been BEGGING my parents to get her to therapy. I asked my dad to email her school counselor to make sure the counselor knew what was going on at home. I asked him to look up therapists. I reminded him that Lee's dad's insurance would cover it. He kind of waved it off, if she doesn't have permission (and I TOLD her to ask me before touching things and I'd probably lend her stuff but she had to ask first) then it's stealing.

Anyway, Christmas is really difficult for her because her mom died just after Christmas a couple years ago. I'm going to show her kindness and try to get along with her again.""

Two nights ago I come home from my boyfriend's (I stay with him on weekends) and my mom was leaving with her sister to visit her other sister in Olympia. As my mom was leaving I ran outside down the driveway to give her the canister of coffee she had made herself and forgotten. I came back upstairs and realized I had left my bedroom door unlocked for ~3 minutes. I shrugged it off and figured she couldn't have done much damage in three minutes. Later that night I was putting together a work outfit for the next day and tried to put on a bra only to find that the straps had been drastically shortened. I scanned the little knob my bras were hanging off and found that one I kept stored in a cupboard (as it didn't fit me anymore) was now hanging with the others. But it was past her bedtime so I didn't wake her. I confronted her the next day (yesterday) when I got home from work. I asked her if she wore them. She said yes. I asked her when she took them. She quickly said the night before

I finally unloaded. I told her how she had made me feel homeless

I opened my underwear drawer to find everything in disarray. A swimsuit I have not worn since last summer was spread out across the top of everything. Things were missing. With a sinking sensation in my gut

Here is the absolute fucking worst part that made me feel like barfing. My vibrators were sitting on top of everything else in their drawer. They were **COVERED IN MENSTRUAL BLOOD.** There were CHUNKS. WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK. It wasn't my mom

All of our doors have locks on them. I don't know how the FUCK she got in or how long she was fucking around with my stuff. My parents' room and my room have the same key so if my dad accidentally left his key out or forgot it in his door then she could have access to my room AAANYtime she wanted. Currently I have a giant chain and padlock on it too.

I furiously strode over to my parents' room and woke up my dad. I told him what I had found. He said he'd handle it in the morning. This morning before work I told him that if he did not either get her into therapy or kick her out of the house then I was moving out. I finally made him choose

So when we finally got home from work we marched into her room to see if she stole anything. We found a fuck ton of more used/stolen makeup, and she said ""Yup"". I asked her if she knew how ridiculously unsanitary and disgusting that was and she just shrugged like we were bothering her or something. What the fuck. 

This time she didn't cry. She just watched us. 

Right now my dad is making her clean everything up. 

When I walked out I told her that we were NOT friends and said ""don't talk to me."" She said ""OKAY"" like ""duh"". Like I was being unreasonable or whatever. I can't look at her without wanting to barf. My stomach is all in knots.

You guys wanted an update? Here's your update. I think what she did is incredibly fucked up and crossed so many lines. She could have cleaned the vibrators off and put them back and I'd never have known. She could have kept them or thrown them away. But the fact that she put them back COVERED IN BLOOD tells me she was trying to send me a fucked up little message - ""I can get in and out of your room whenever I want and you can't do anything about it."" I would move out if I could but the job market sucks and I can't afford to live with roommates/by myself. My dad at least FINALLY got around to putting her in therapy. I have the vibrators ziplock-bagged as evidence. In the meantime I am moving ANYTHING I hold valuable to my boyfriend's (underwear, it's fucking lucky she has metal allergies or she'd be swiping my jewelry as well). She may someday get better, but that's years down the line and in the meantime I am fucking sick to my stomach.

1357143772.0,15txdk,Am I [26F] doing the right thing by cutting-off my alcoholic mother and enabling grandparents?,apninetypointfive,154,37,94,"I'm having a really hard time figuring out if I am doing the right thing here. This is a ridiculously convoluted story (as most are) and I want to be able to give the important details without drowning you in the small nuances. But I’m going to ramble anyway.

I've had a strained relationship with my mother for my entire life. She has been a binge drinker in and out of the hospital (though NOT in AA or residential care) for over 25 years. 

She was married to my father 8 years before they had their first (and only kid - me). Her first hospitalization was 6 months after I was born. After that point, she befriended a woman who she met in the newspaper personals and began a romantic relationship. She and that woman have been in an out of a relationship since that time. This woman is actually somewhat sane (I guess only as much as I am since we both keep allowing her in our lives).

At her worst, around 2007, by the time no one had heard from her in 3 days, I stopped by her apartment on my way to class one morning. I knocked at the front door and could hear mumbling somewhere within the apartment. The front door had glass in it, so I was trying to see as far in from every angle until I finally saw her trying to crawl to the door. She was covered in a concoction of blood and vomit. She could barely stand by the time she got to the door and ended up hitting her head on the handle several times when trying to unlock it (it was dead-bolted, so I couldn’t get in). By this time, she was so frightened because she was in withdrawal and couldn’t control her body – the tremors were so strong, they were able to get her out and get her to the hospital. 

The second most traumatic part about these situations for me is the time at the hospital. Once I get there, anger, hatred. 

A few weeks or months will go by and she contacts me and tells me how wonderful she is doing now and how her life is back on track. Goddammit, I feel like shit about myself.

I eventually give in and go see her. She is such a charming person. She owns her own business (which is why she is always able to come back to “sanity” quickly and doesn’t have more severe consequences from her binges. We talk about things and see each other regularly. Everything is peachy. At this point in the cycle

It ALWAYS cycles through. She’s gone a year between a cycle (those binges hurt me the worst, not my favorite person.

At the end of college, but I heard about them from my grandparents and felt them from the gaps in our relationship. After 2 years in this new state, the economy had collapsed in the market there and my husband and I moved home. She was in the middle of a really long sobriety stage. I spent time with her, we even made plans for me to join her company (so stupid, I know!).

This was the first time I ever saw how horribly sick she still was when “dry.” This was the first time I saw how badly my grandparents enabled her alcoholism. I ended up getting very bitter with all of them. My mom finally moved out of the home she shared with the new, it made family get-togethers very difficult. I’m the only grandchild, so when I came over and it was just the four of us, there isn’t really a way to remain distant with her. My mother refused to accept the boundaries that I placed and my grandparents would eventually come to be aggravated with me for the “inconvenience.”

So, calling, and texting me that she wants back in my life and she lives with them. I know from mutual acquaintances that she was arrested for a hit and run DUI during this time period, so she is continuing the cycle and will do so until her demise.

My grandparents are in their late-80s and can’t leave the house (my grandmother has dementia and refuses to go outside)

**TL;DR** My irreparably alcoholic mother has intertwined her life with her parents in such a way that it feels impossible to keep a relationship with my grandparents while I’m trying to keep her out of my life (for my sanity).

Am I doing the right thing? Should I include them back in my life and just try to ignore her?

I finally confronted them. I decided to not do one-on-ones

And I said

They both argued that nothing needed to change. Hannah was Jason's most adamant defender. ""He's our best friend- he would never put me in that situation or hurt you. Why are you letting one conversation change the way you see him?""

For some reason this just made me angry. I wanted her to apologize and stand next to me instead of staying on the couch and going to bat for him. So I lost my temper. And he didn't- he kept calmly repeating the same phrase over and over again ""I'm not out to seduce your wife 'lex. I respect marriage."" 

Eventually I burst out

Jason: I did that because I take marriage seriously. We were 22 and barely out of college and you said you didn't know why you proposed, I toasted your marriage and said you two were meant to be. I danced with your wife and didn't let myself wish she was mine for one moment. Because I'm your best friend and now you throw this in my face.

And I didn't have much to say. Hannah was in tears and I just felt.. drained. He hugged my wife and said that he was going

And me and my wife managed to say very little at all. Eventually we talked the next day. I told her how much I loved her and that I just had cold feet THREE years ago. I then asked if she could slow down on her friendship with him

I know they went to church together Sunday. It bothered me

Things are still tense between us and me and Jason aren't talking yet. I hope that it isn't always going to feel this way.

Not even particularly sure of where to start with this one. My mother and I have had a very close relationship for the majority of my life. She was, she'd yell at me for making her worry; she's constantly pressured me to achieve academically, despite claims that she ""only wants me to try my best"" (if my ""best"" wasn't the highest grade possible, it wasn't good enough, and was simply a sign that i was being lazy). Even at 21 now (soon to be 22), I'm not allowed to close my door at night (""in case there's a fire!""), I had to deal with her telling me about 4 times a day that she hated my hair after I dyed it blonde, and she has no problems telling me to only dress in clothes that she knows her own mother likes

I live in NSW and was born in Australia, have been forced to change my privacy settings so that any family on fb (those who i have friended, and even those who i haven’t) cannot see ANY photos of my boyfriend and I looking ""too close"". Telling my mother that I was potentially going to spend a weekend with my boyfriend in the Northern Beaches simply received a ""You mean near where your cousins live? Where they could EASILY see you?!"" in response. My parents accidentally saw a post my boyfriend had put up on fb that related to me sleeping over… their response was “If this EVER gets out and humiliates your grandparents, the rules around here will change”.

When I initially asked my parents if i would be able to sleep at my boyfriends house (probably 1.5 months into our relationship), my parents gave in. They set strict rules about it being ONLY on weekends. And even now, it is something ""no-one can EVER find out about"". During the period of arguments, my mother continually told me that my absence for approximately 3 days a week meant i was ""basically no longer part of the family"", was ""showing NO respect at all for their values"" (even after hearing them out, trying to help them see my point of view and explain that this was a NORMAL thing at my age), and she eventually called me a ""slut"" for my behaviour. Despite having never had a relationship before, and simply wanting to sleep at my boyfriend's house. Any time I've since asked to sleep over during the week or switch a weekend day to another day

My mother has been severely depressed her entire life. She attempted suicide when she was very young, suffers from anorexia and barely eats, and has refused treatment for approximately 25 years. She doesn't take care of herself at all, and has behaved as though she is slowly waiting to die my entire life. There is NO chance she would ever contemplate getting help. Both my sister (27) and I have tried... I have tried pleading with her, begging her to do it for her children... nothing. She has *always* said ""i love you and i dont want to fight"", and that we’re essentially her only reason for living, but she never actually addresses any of the problems and issues i raise… even (especially) in regards to her own life. 

In the context of this, she was very got very close to driving her car into a tree. She has said that the ""shame"" of such a thing would destroy her own mother, and she just wouldn't be able to handle it. I'm well aware of how emotionally abusive this strategy is, but i genuinely believe she would kill herself if i were to ever move out.

In my current situation (finishing my 4th year of university), in addition to talking to him online, is ""spending an unhealthy amount of time together"" and that “he’ll just get sick of me"". Any time i've attempted to raise an argument and say that her words have been hurtful, she condescendingly says ""oh poor, poor you"" and tells me that my life is incredibly easy, and i'm just whining or being selfish… that I have no idea how hard I’ve made *her* life recently. Its one thing to attempt to control a person, but it's another to COMPLETELY invalidate any feelings they might have about it at the same time, we’ve both said we’d try to me more mindful of each other’s feelings

My father is similarly conservative, but I have been told by both my parents that if i do not get first class honours for my thesis this year, I will be paying for my own uni debts. My father paid for my sister's university degree, and he was doing the same for me... but it has now become grade-dependent. I remember getting a letter sent home saying that i'd come 2nd overall in one of my subjects last semester... he saw the letter, and the only thing he said was ""So that was the standard pre-boyfriend then."" It's been constant... both parents saying ""Well if i asked your supervisor what he'd predict you'd get, he'd say first class honours without a doubt, because that's what you SHOULD be getting"". I was terrified about not getting Ds or HDs in my course work because they would have used that as a reason why i should spend less time with my boyfriend, i'm ""fucking up my life"" because ""boyfriends come and go

I'm genuinely at a loss as to how to deal with the situation. My boyfriend has been **incredibly** supportive, and that moving out is not an option financially (and if it were to become one, it would potentially lead my mother to attempt suicide).

This time of depression began to weigh heavily on our relationship. We were not communicating well. There were several angry arguments (we sat down and counted 7


March, and things really did seem to get better. Our communication was getting better; I was making sure that I was leaving her notes, taking her on dates, and communication love to her in way that I know she responds to the best. Likewise, she was telling me that she was “checking back in” and that time would heal our situation. We have not had one single unhealthy argument since we started our marriage counseling, not one. 


August 1st, I have never cheated or even acted inappropriately with other women, she just has these jealously issues). We had to “agree to disagree” about this stuff, but I didn’t think too much of it. 


August 15th, and I meet her at a park. She tells me there that she wants a divorce. She says she just can’t check back into our relationship. She cites our 2 trivial arguments as proof that I don’t care about her, she apologies, I try and plea my love and put our relationship into perspective, but she has made up her mind and already told her family.


There is no reasoning with her. I have written letters, but my wife is checked out and there is nothing I can do.


Before we got married, goals, and ways of living takes work. I feel like my wife took the easy path out of our relationship, she gave up when the going got a little rough, checked out, and wasn’t willing to stay true to her vows and work on our marriage to keep it alive. I know that this is common. People are excited about the love they have found, get married without fully getting to know someone (you think you do!)


I don’t really know why I’m putting all of this on here. I just am glad to have a place I can put my thoughts down and share my experience.

I say we were on and off because I broke it off with her after a months into our dating. It didn't go well at all, and maybe I didn't handle it the best way possible, but I figured I was doing both of us favor.

Anyhow, things would be okay. It was during this time that she revealed many things to me about who she was and how she felt about me. 
She told me things like she had to teach herself to hate everything about me in order to get over it. That she could *never* forget what I did to her
Perhaps I was being naive, and essentially did everything she asked. But no matter how hard I tried, it never seemed enough.

On top of all this, tells me all my friends are stupid, throws things across the room, puts me down for having a ""easy job"", doesn't let me speak when I have an opposing opinion and when she feels that she's right. 
Because of her reactions, because I feel like such a hypocrite, I fail all the time. I want to make her happy, have her feel safe, and trust me, but she continues to say, even after being married to me

I have no friends now and no life outside of my marriage. I have  siblings (all older except one) and none of them know my stuggle. I keep to myself because that is the only way I know how to deal with the pain. Should I try to bring it up to my wife

On top of all this, stating that she realized that when she was intoxicated she would say hurtful things to me. She stated that knowing was enough to get her to stop. She stayed sober for two months before she started again. And now, I'm fearing the worst again.

And now the worst part: I've begun to comtemplate suicide. I've even considered murdering her. I wont' do it. I don't have the courage

I'm very happy with our relationship on most levels. We share a lot of interests and are comfortable talking about those we don't, we have the same goals in life, we feel the same way about kids; it's really awesome and I do love him. But as for attraction, I don't feel it any more at all and it makes me so upset. I want sex, I really do, just not with him. I refuse to cheat on him, so I have got to fix this somewhow.

In my defense, and he rarely if ever brushes his teeth. His job also involves driving in his van each day, so he sits and just kind of, well, marinates. Let me say up front that I've never had an orgasm so sex has always been nice but not really a big deal for me, because it never really goes anywhere if that makes sense, but I still used to like it. Lately though, it's really about getting him off as quickly as possible because I really

There's more to it than sex, while I'm doing all the chores around the house. He also is off three days a week whereas I work a normal 8-5 M-F schedule, and he acts like I have more time than him. 

He asked me years ago when we were dating to nag him, putting out garbage every week and cleaning the cat litter. The garbage is put out maybe one week in three, and I've taken over cleaning up after our two cats because he would never clean to the point that they were going on the carpet to make a point. I can remind him and remind him, and I do it when he's not in the middle of something, but it's always in one ear and out the other. 

I feel as though he doesn't listen to me in general actually, he immediately jumped up and headed for the shower. I was upset after this (random strangers merit cleanliness but the woman you're trying to screw relentlessly doesn't?) and when he asked me what was wrong, I told him without trying to point any blame, and he blew me off completely, pretending to saw at his wrists like I was being overdramatic. Usually he's not so callous though it's becoming more the norm lately, and it really doesn't make me feel like talking. However, whenever even in jokes the idea that I might leave him comes up

What do I do? I enjoy our relationship immensely besides these things. Is this relationship counseling material? He's never believed in counseling but he'd probably go if I asked him. The most depressing part is that even if I absolutely wanted to

I noticed it one day about 2 months back when she was sitting next to me and it peaked my curiosity because she's never had one on there before. Then over the next 2 months, she would state that it was one of her female friends she worked with.

However

The phone was filled with romantic texts from her female friend that she works with. Mornings contained texts that said ""good morning beautiful/buttercup/lover."" There were texts that said ""I miss you so much,"" and ""I'm drunk and I wish I was with you right now.""

However

I was crushed by these texts and I confronted her about them. I didn't care if it was a man or a woman; I cared that it appeared she had fallen in love with another person. She told me that she didn't have romantic feelings for this girl and that she was only ""flirting"" with her because she enjoyed how she made her feel in terms of making her feel sexually wanted. She said they started as just work friends, it's just this other girl also makes her feel great about herself and liked getting the reinforcement from more than one person. I asked her why she said things like ""if only we didn't live so far away,"" and, ""i need to be with you,"" and ""i miss you,"" and she just told me that she only said those things because her work friend was coming on to her so much and was making her feel so good and she felt like she had to say those things to ""keep her on the hook"" and not lose her. I tried to be completely nonjudgemental and accepting of her curiosity but she just keep saying over and over that ""I don't want a relationship with a woman and I'm not physically attracted to woman."" (She said the planned meeting this past weekend never would have happened because she would have called it off...). For hours she just kept saying ""I'm so sorry, I'm an idiot

I'm crushed. I feel like man or woman, but I don't think that makes it acceptable for her to send romantic texts in return. I also don't really believe her when she says she was just trying to ""keep her on the hook"" and doesn't have any romantic feelings for her or women in general. If she had done this with a guy, it would be over no questions asked. However, even though I feel just as crushed and hurt, I don't know what to do with our relationship because I really love this girl and want to believe what she says. I'm terrified that somewhere down the road, some guy or girl again will come along who makes her feel sexually wanted and tempts her and this will all happen again. I can't sleep and am just thinking in my head over and over what I could have possibly done wrong even though she said there is nothing I could change, and that I do in fact make her feel sexually attractive and wanted (and we have sex 3-4 times per week which is at our baseline). I'm just trying so hard in this relationship and am constantly trying to do romantic things for her, she still couldn't turn down temptation when someone else gave her attention too.

She contacted this girl and told her to never contact her again and that it was over

And before the 3some talk comes out

I'd just like to state that we feel terrible for what we did.  We were between a rock and hard place and we felt this could either prove her innocence or prove us right. 

Our friend (21M) James** Has been with his long distance girlfriend for over a year.  We only learned about her the end of last year. She lives in Thailand. He took a trip by himself to Thailand in March last year to meet her.  At this point they were not together. Having talked to her a few times he bought tickets and flew half way around the world to see her.  They spent a week together in a hotel before parting ways

Something about her nagged at us.  We heard she was refused entry into America

One day, there she was!  Updates regularly. Many photos. NONE of my friends and her.  So me and a few friends gently tell our friend about this saying that we had found her thought he should know.  He tries to go onto her facebook and he can't get on it.  Shes freaking BLOCKED him.  So he vanishes offline.  We start to worry, but know he was probably at that point confronting her.  He comes back to say everythings fine.  

We ask him what she said.  She told him that she regularly deactivates her account.  Ok

We try for a while to make him see sense.  We even tried to support him

Now heres what made us take action.  

He's buying a ring.  He's about to propose to this girl who is blatantly lying to him.  He has never had a girlfriend before

We made a fake profile online and messaged her.  We prayed she wouldnt reply. That she would tell us she had a boyfriend. But she proved us right in the end.

She said she was single for 2 years.  That she's never met anyone online before and that she wanted to meet our fake guy.  It was heart wrenching.  We are now at a loss on how to handle this.  We don't want to hurt our friend.  We understand we betrayed his trust. But he was about to fly across the world with a ring and propose to someone who is playing him. 

What should we do? 

I understand we will get downvoted and get replies about how we should have kept our noses out... But if YOUR friend was about to be crushed and was in love with a backstabbing first girlfriend who could destroy his outlook on relationships... What would YOU do?

TL;DR:  Made a fake dating profile to catch out friend's LDR girlfriend. She is still arranging to meet men and said she was single. Friend is about to propose to this monster.  How do we tell him?

We've been married for two years now.  When we were dating, I went to the store, bought dinner, cooked dinner, was awesome.  Since then, it's been a slow decline to the point where I just basically sit on the couch if I'm not at work and he does everything else. 

 I have some medical things going on, I'm in pretty constant pain with my kidneys and by the end of the day, I don't even want to drive myself home.  I was just diagnosed with some other bullshit disease recently also, and I've started a new medication that's really made me have to alter my life and I'm just sick, like, physically ill, all of the time since I've started it

He's been seriously the best husband I could ask for.  He's been so patient and he's been taking care of me through everything.  It's been getting worse over the past two years and he's just adapted to everything and he never complains and he never asks for anything in return.  He's just a little worker bee all the time and if he's not running to the store to get something for me to do (I've taken up cross-stitching since my life is based around the couch!  10/10 would recommend.), so everything just sort of fell on him to do.  He works out of town, so he's only home on the weekends.  I try to keep everything as clean as it was when it left.  I vacuum at least twice a week (we have four dogs, omg.) and I keep things off of the floors so that the rooms don't get overwhelming. It's just hard because when I'm up and moving around, then I start to hurt, and then I'm down for a longer period of time.  

I guess all of that wouldn't be so bad if I would just put out, and b) this new medication that I'm on is just kicking my ass.  

I am ridiculously insecure about everything.  I know that it's in sickness and in health,"".  The only thing that I really contribute right now, other than my paycheck, is taking care of the finances.  I always try to budget so that we can buy him whatever toys he wants, but I feel like that, obviously, isn't going to keep him here if he wants to leave.  He's never once expressed any interest in ever dissolving our marriage, but it's still really just..hurtful that I can't be the wife that he deserves. 

What can I do to make myself a better wife for my really awesome husband?  I know it's a hard question since there's an actual medical reason that I'm a shitty wife

TL;DR: I have some dumb medical bullshit going on that wears me out and doesn't give me the energy to do anything but survive and my husband has picked up all of my slack.  I'm afraid he might resent me one day.

We started dating November 6th, but we stayed together.  Two months after I entered active duty, I bought her a plane ticket and flew her out to visit me.  I asked her to marry me in the rose garden at Point Defiance in Tacoma, Washington.  My heart was beating out of my chest.  I spent all the money I had on the perfect ring for her.  She said yes.  

She went back to school for her last year and I went to my first unit.  I got orders to deploy and we scheduled the wedding a week before hand.  We got married.  She was so beautiful and I was happy.  Everything was perfect.  The deployment was delayed.  I was stressed out and nervous.  She was homesick.  

Earlier this year I left for Afghanistan.  I remember holding her in my office and telling her that everything was going to be okay.  I didn't want to make it any harder on her

Things moved fast over here.  I heard from her less and less.  She started spending more and more money, she told me that she was no longer in love with me and she would be filing for divorce.  

I've begged her not to do it.  I've told her that everything is my fault and that I can change to fix our relationship.  I've told her that we can go to counseling or therapy.  I've told her that I will do anything to make her happy.  All she has said is that she is miserable with me, for six years and now she is leaving me.

After I stopped taking the birth control things were better, etc) at least 1-2 times a week, and have sex maybe once a month (this was a lot for us believe it or not). 

However, but it has been months. At first he said he was stressed about school and gaining some weight, which I can understand. However, nothing has changed, and he hasn't made any real attempt to lose weight (I don't care for appearances, but if it will get him to sleep with me then I want him to lose weight).

I thought perhaps if I lost weight it would help
I don't know what to do anymore. I've brought it up countless times and all he does is bring up that I used to never be horny and somehow that makes it all okay. I realize that it's hypocritical of me

When I finally got him to talk rationally about it he claims that sex takes too long, when it should be something we both enjoy. At first he would always want to skip foreplay because until recently I didn't know how to get myself to orgasm, and so I sent him this huge email with articles on ways to improve sex for the woman, and he didn't read any of it, or if he did he hasn't put any of it into practice.

We always have sex after we fight for some reason

I ask if it's me and he always gets upset that I would even think that, right?

Whenever we do get intimate, but now I'll take what I can get no matter how tired). He'll rub my clit (the one way I've found I can get off) but it takes a while, and he'll start scoughing or sighing because his hand is tired and I'll just fake an orgasm, blow him and he goes to sleep while I usually get up and go masturbate, resentfully.

Other than the sex/romance aspect I think I'm pretty happy in our relationship. I think we've just sort of become so comfortable in our relationship so it's passionless and we don't do as much together as we once did.

For a while (maybe 18 months but it probably started earlier) I have felt that I really don't love him any more and would like to leave. We married young (as students so no idea where life would take us) and while we were in love we have both changed so much in the meantime that I feel now like I am living with a very annoying roommate. It has gone beyond the general irritation I hear about from friends my age where they can get upset with each other but still make a connection. I know something is very wrong with the way I feel about him compared to how I used to feel. 

To give some examples, lately I have been encouraging him to go out, or to spend time playing computer games, and I have scheduled kids activities for most evenings so that we don't have to have dinner together. When he is not home my life with the kids feels perfect, when is is around I feel upset and resentful at the intrusion. Weekends are very difficult for me because I have to spend time in conversation, and our interests have diverged to the point where we each listen politely to the others news but there is no shared enthusiasm. We have tried ""date night"" but for me there is nothing different about our conversation in a fancy restaurant. I tried to think of an activity we could both go out and do but came up with nothing. 

I have been trying to think about what has changed. Probably the main issue is that I have never been attracted to geeks. I always went for the strong silent type and he was a lot more like this when he was younger, when he isnt at the computer coding or playing games, talks non stop, breaks into song every few sentences and bounces around the house like Tigger. The constant activity really gets to me. The killer is, he is like this because he is happy and the happier he is, the bouncier he gets. Even his taste in music is so different to mine now and he will insist on blasting it through the house all the time. This is such a petty, petty thing but does affect my quality of life.

Reasons I have to stay: on paper we have the dream life. House, great kids, good careers, etc. My husband has finally snagged his dream job but needs to focus on it and I feel I can't turn everything upside down now, I know it would derail and depress him for years. My kids love their neighborhood, love their Dad, how can I break all that up. I have a great life in other ways, work

I know this is all about me and I am going to get downvoted. But this is all coming from me, but he does seem to think it is a mid life crisis or me being neurotic. I have told him he should find someone who he can have things in common with and who will be happy to talk to him about his interests but he seems to put this down to low self esteem (it isn't! I just want us both to be happy and fulfilled...) He says he still loves me and when I ask why he laughs and smiles and says something flippant like ""because you are hot"" and I feel like that annoying puppy who yaps all the time but you still adore. 

I have tried talking about this very frankly with him, that I don't feel like spending time with him, etc and he just seems to take it all in his stride. I know his parents lived very seperate lives and he thinks that is normal, as long as I am there to talk to sometimes he doesn't seem to feel the need for constant companionship. 

Meanwhile I have engineered this situation where I spend as little time as I can with him, laugh with, share things with. I get so jealous when I see couples doing things together (even if it is only shopping), joking around, having a fun time... I sometimes tell myself it is only until the kids grow up, but that is a long time. 

I have come to the conclusion the only way to do this is to turn things around at home

I need to mention

**tldr; I am no longer attracted to my husband

**Update 1**: Wow. I didn't expect so many comments, where you have actually read fully what I had to say. For those saying I am selfish, I acknowledge I am...this is all about me because I am the only one unhappy and the one who has to make or force a change, if that makes sense... But this post was also all about how I can stay in this relationship, not about the easiest way to leave. Thanks. 

**Update 2**: I wish I could answer more of your comments, not necessarily sex. I know we can work on that. With the loss of the physical connection and the emotional one (our interests going in different directions so we have little common ground) I guess I feel like I have lost my ""soulmate"".

So after my last post things have gotten considerably better. Here is what worked for me:

* **More me time** - Obviously I wasn't being myself

* **Find myself** This sounds like a weird one, and I was generally more happy. Additionally I acted more confident, which in the end actually made me more confident. I'd find really fun things to do with my wife for our date nights, and keep them a secret. 

* **http://www.marriedmansexlife.com/** Despite disagreeing with many of what the person writes, how to approach certain topics, etc. One good one - try not to make sex a question where the default answer is 'no'.

* **Want her to want me** One person was right when they said it sounded like I just wanted someone to have sex with. Rather, but rather I wasn't being attractive enough? So I've made it a point to reflect &amp; listen carefully to what she says. Does she not like it when I go too long without a haircut? Does she hate it when the kids bedroom has toys on the floor? I tried to pick up on these things &amp; make them my priority. And if I'm not sure I ask her. 

**The result has been positive.** Our sex lives have improved, although it's a game I'm happy to play. We're both flirting more. Our date nights are a ball. Life is good.

About 2 years into our marriage, she always said she loved me and wanted me to join her. I would tell her that I had to finish school. I had no idea about the affair or that she felt she should carry on an affair.

Anyway, I had to make a choice to keep the family together and quietly suffer the shame of everyone we knew knowing about the affair or break up the family. I didn't want to break up the family so I choose the former. Edit: in total, I believe the affair lasted a few months but I have never talked to her about it without her getting angry so I don't know the truth of anything.

Over time

Upon her return

I was never able to bring up this issue in marriage counseling. Whenever I did

During a very recent discussion about marriage counseling, I also got up and told her (firmly) that she should sit down and we should talk about it.

She said something very strange in response: ""If you tell me what to do

She pushed past me and went to the neighbours. I did not try to stop her. I thought the neighbours might mediate this situation so I also went over. She refused to talk to me so I went for a drive.

Little did I know... Upon my return

I was arrested and sent to jail.

I now have a restraining order (automatic even if you are accused of looking at a woman the wrong way in my location). I sleep on a couch. I can't see my family except with the court ordered agreement. I have been crying every night since I got back from jail and now it's creeping into the days.

I filed for divorce 2 days after coming back from jail.

My back story - I've never dated a single mother. At the age of 20 I made a choice to never have kids, Olive [f6] and really enjoyed both their company. My entire opinion on children has changed in these past three months. My answer to the question ""would you ever have kids?"" has changed from ""no"" to; ""depends on the person.""

Lindsay backstory - Lindsay has always had a type of guy she would date. The tattooed bad boy or older guys who have spent time in jail. Her past three bf have spent light jail time and were possessive and abusive. Her daughter's father wasn't in her life for the first three years or so. She seems to welcome negativity into her life. I think this is why she is a little shy and hides her feelings. 

When we reconnected three months ago we became good friends. But I made it clear friends isn't what I wanted. I wanted more from her. But she was a little stand off-ish and would only hang out with me around other friends. Until about three weeks ago. I openly confessed my feeling towards her. She accepted and we have been dating since then. 

Last night we were having a nice

She told me

Is that a good thing? It kinda makes me feel like if Olive wasn't in her life she wouldn't want to be with me. The thing is

When we first reconnected I wanted to show her I accept her and her daughter. So I would focus my attention on Olive. Be stern but kind to her. Listen when she had something to tell me. Watch when she wanted to show me something. Help her mom when it's bedtime or she needed time to relax. Olive has taken to me very well and always asks her mom when I'm coming over again. She told her mom how happy she was when she mistakenly saw us kiss. 

So I am asking you this. How can I get Lindsay more into me? Am I doing the right thing? I feel like I'm not really her type. I have tattoos and piercings. But I'm not a douche bag lol. At my age I look at women differently. I see a future with her. How can I show her I'm the right guy for her?

TL;DR - met a girl with a kid. She told me she likes me because how much her daughter likes me and how good I am with her. Is this good or bad? How can I get her more into me as a boyfriend?

Edit/update: wow! Lots of great comments. I feel like I need to defend Lindsay here a little. She is financially stable and gives Olivia everything she need. She is a nice and caring person. She has always been an awesome mother. That should never be under question. 

I would also like to defend my manhood a little. I am a journeyman welder and run a crew of four other guys. I race dirt bikes as a hobby. I know what it means to be aggressive and an ""alpha"" male. I live my life never backing down. Never turn a cheek.

We get time to be intimate and she initiates hugs and kisses lots. I think I need to look at the entire picture and not just this one statement. She asks for me to be around even when the father has Olivia. 

A lot of people have mentioned its still a new relationship and I agree. Thank you all for your encouraging words.

First. Thanks reddit. This is an awesome community with a lot of wisdom and I appreciated and took to heart all points of view in the responses to my original post. Thank you so very much to anyone who took the time to respond.

So we talked about everything last night. I planned on shelving the issue for a little while and just couldn't do it when I saw him. Apparently I am unable to keep my feelings bottled up which ended up being such a good thing. 

I told him I was scared. I told him I felt vulnerable. I asked him questions that were weighing on me. I pretty much just laid it all on the line. And it was amazing. Communication is such an awesome thing. This level of communication in a relationship is entirely new to me and totally freeing. There is nothing I can't say. 

After our talk I have no hesitations. No fear. Love is a hard word for him but we agreed on a few things. By my definition of love

I also asked him to promise me that if some day, to please tell me that. To cut me loose. He promised me he would, though he assured me he wasn't thinking that way.

We talked about our future and our life together. The rest of our lives stuff. He sees me in it. And even though he struggles with saying the word love

I brought up one other thing. That I felt he pressured me into saying it. And though I already knew that I felt that

So we are so good right now. I am beyond happy and even excited about my future. And in my present. Things are good. Life is good. And I'm in love and not scared of it at all.

Now my step-dad has begun dating again. As hard as it has been for me

When they moved in, he knew the daughter through mutual friends prior to her mom dating our step-dad, making the living situation very awkward for him to begin with. He dealt with it was by spending more time at work/with friends and less time at home. However, when he was home the daughter was very rude and disrespectful towards him.

While I do not particularly care for the new girlfriend, I was lurking around on Instagram and stumbled across her account. I looked at her pictures and there was a picture of a skeleton hand with a middle finger with the caption “Hey, fuck you L!” (in reference to my mom). 

That

My mom loved her house. She spent years designing, as she wanted. 

I feel like this girl’s actions are entirely disrespectful and she isn't seeing any repercussion from them. Everyone knows about the party and how she treated my brother

Again

I have to admit

I didn't encounter hostility that first day; we had a good talk and a lot of productive things came out of it - mainly, but I was able to take that first step for my bf. Since then, he has spoken with and scheduled a therapy appointment without my guidance and for a very low fee. I will be paying for his weekly therapy, but he *really* needs it. I'm also hoping he also gets some medication to help with the ADHD, as I think it's one of the very basic underlying problems here.

In the past two weeks, intimacy has *tripled*. He's able to be present with me now, or maybe he's just not looking at tons of porn anymore.

Because I felt so awful about ""isolating"" him from friends/family, but a $10 was something I could deal with. *He told me to do it anyway, as he would find a way to come up with the extra money per month.* 

I didn't ask him how on Earth that was possible when he had no job, he thought it was acceptable to keep it for himself instead of helping me with bills!!

No answer. Instead

Fast forward to yesterday. Smart guy that he is

We got in a huge fight yesterday because I told him flat out I had no intention of ever turning the internet back on. He told me I was treating him like a child and controlling him

""This is how it starts

Since yesterday, I just want him out of my apartment and my life - not necessarily for ever, but definitely for now. He sees this and has been trying to be extra sweet to me. What I see is how manipulative his addiction is (being alternately logical, sweet, or furious towards me) it's kind of horrifying. But I don't think that's him, I think it's the addiction talking. I hope.

I don't trust him; I don't trust his actions or the words he says. That alone is really scary because I'm trapped *living* with this person!

Some backstory, or his, so it's not really a matter of spending too much time together. There's just too many things wrong with his house, and where he lives, that makes it impossible for me to consider moving there.

Basically, so it only made sense for me to move into my childhood home, so I wouldn't be paying rent. It's a larger house, 5 bedrooms, 4 1/2 baths, nice kitchen, huge yard, it's always been my ideal house (possibly because I grew up here) but I love it. I also have two dogs

My boyfriend, and occasionally comes home during the summer. This left him with her house to take care of. Problem is, I really really dislike his house. It's not his fault, his mom was just horrible at taking care of things when he moved out the first time, so there's a lot of work that needs to be done and he doesn't have the money right to now to fix everything.

His house is also really small. It's only 2 bedroom, small yard, his washer/dryer is almost shot, and it's in a small town that's in the middle of fucking no where. Guess what else is in his small town? All of his ex's. That's not a huge deal, all of my ex's live in my city too. But when you live somewhere that only has one grocery store, one restaurant, and one gas station, but she's not. She's bitched me out at the grocery store before

My house is closer to his job and my job, instead of 45 from his.) We decided a few months ago that we wanted to move in together, and then he hit me out of no where with the ""Well, you can just move into my house.""

That's just... not going to happen. It makes WAY more sense for him to move in here (more room, love each other, etc. Yeah, they could break up, but they're both financially stable enough to do something else instead of moving back here. I wouldn't have a problem with that, but my mom has made it very clear that she doesn't want to live here anymore, and would rather rent an apartment than move back in. 

I told him I would have to think about it, and it sucks. But there's just no way I'm willing to compromise on that. Obviously, I'm not willing to give up my dogs. I've had one for the past 8 years, it wouldn't be fair to stick him in a tiny little yard when he's been used to his yard. I hated it when I lived in my apartment, so I'm certainly not doing that again. 

So now we're stuck with two houses that neither wants to live in. I asked if he'd be okay renting out his house, and she doesn't want him to leave it. My house is in my name now, so I could always rent it out but the upkeep is too much to expect someone renting it to take care of, and I don't have the time to drive down here, mow a yard, clean a pool, etc. as much as it needs to be done.

I've explained all of this to him, but it's not logical and we'd end up worse off than we would be living in my house. I just don't know what to do. I don't want something this stupid ruining this relationship, but I just can't imagine living there.

Our roles have switched over the last 6 months, and really want to make things work. **However**, over the past few days she's made it clear she wants to draft a prenup before we get married. She wants a prenup stating that the money we come in with before marriage or make during marriage to remain seperate in the event of a divorce. We're both from middle-class families and have no ""family money"" to speak of. The only money at stake here is my modest saving account/future earnings and her future earnings. Is signing a prenup in this situation really a reasonable expectation? The whole idea makes me feel very uncomfortable- like she doesn't totally trust me. I also feel kind of insulted that she could think- however remote a possibility- that I would try to steal ""her"" money if we got a divorce. I kind of understand the utility of having one from a purley rational perspective, but doesn't sit well with me on a emotional level.

My husband and I got married 2 years ago and were together for a year and some change before that. Before our relationship

Prior to our marriage

Up to and during this time

We get married and continue seeing the therapist. It comes out during therapy that he's just not really interested in sex, the real truth comes out: he knew it was important to me, he just didn't want me to leave him so he wasn't honest. That made me extremely upset as well. The crux of the matter wasn't that he didn't want to have sex, his sex drive was just waaaaay lower than mine...or so he said.

During this therapy

He doesn't. We stop having (admittedly bad) sex.

More therapy reveals that he has no idea what turns him on and isn't really interested in finding out. It also comes out that he's so passive that even suggesting he be assertive results in him shutting down. He also has serious anxiety about sex. The net result of those things is that he would not initiate sex. These discussions and more resulted in the therapist telling him he needed to see another therapist to work on ""bulking up"" which was code for building up some...self esteem? Mental fortitude? The goal was for him to be able to face the anxiety about sex head on and push through it.

We're still not having sex. He is bitter at me for not initiating.

I continue seeing the original therapist while he see's his new one. I ask him how his sessions are going afterward, she lets slip that he's stopped seeing the new therapist. He hadn't told me that. We get into a giant fight about it and I tell him it seems like he isn't very interested in fixing himself, he wants me to fix him. I forgive him after some time for lying but I still feel resentment that he doesn't want to put any effort into making things better. I stop seeing the original therapist.

We're still not having sex. He is still bitter for me not initiating. I am now resentful at him for all of it. The lying about his interest in sex before we were married, everything. It comes to a head last January when I had to come home from work because I forgot something. I don't announce that I'm coming home and end up walking in on him masturbating to porn. I have nothing against porn or masturbation but since he hadn't even displayed an ounce of sexual desire in my direction for the previous year, it made me angry that he obviously had some needs and was addressing those needs solo instead of with the wife he hadn't touched for quite a while.

I go back to work and later that evening when he comes home, not being desired by my husband is sending me off the deep end and I can't do it to myself anymore. He cries, says he'll go back to therapy, will start trying to initiate sex, etc. I believe him and stay in the marriage.

6 months go by and he hasn't done a thing. I don't remind him to do anything because I don't want to be a nagging wife but also because I want him to take some responsibility for himself, jumped on the bed and yelled ""KILL IT!""  Apparently he was mad that I thought he should kill it instead of killing it myself and proceeds to yell at me about it. This pushes me over the brink and I start thinking about just giving up my job and moving in with my dad just to be out of the relationship.

Luckily the job situation sorted itself out and I was able to find a place. He went out of town and when he came back, I told him maybe we could try dating while we lived in separate places, to see if we can salvage it. He was very agreeable to that.

I moved out in early November 2012 and I haven't seen him since. He hasn't really talked to me since and every time I attempt communication, he says yes. I haven't been seeing anyone since we've been separated and still haven't had sex. I'm tired of being in limbo. Should I go ahead and have divorce papers drawn up or should I give him a chance to get over his anger/hurt and attempt to salvage the relationship? We have no kids.

She moved out a couple weeks after my last update, in a neutral location, so we could keep arranging things and figuring out how things were going to go after we filed.

Two months ago yesterday, or we'll argue over things that had happened.  The difference?  There's no yelling now, no screaming.  We're not fighting so much as explaining why something bothers us, and how it bothers us, and asking each other to help the other one to be more comfortable.

Me, have similar interests and ambitions, my friends and family love him and we're planning to move in together this spring! But this may be a dealbreaker.....

Most of his friends are women and that is totally fine by me. However, ok. I think that reasoning is a little strange but due to the fact that he has had sex with at least 3 (that I know of) of his best female friends it makes me preeettty uncomfortable.

I'm not trying to police his behavior or who is friends are

Today when we were together he was on FB (he has no relationship status about us/pics of us) and I glanced and saw a comment he just received. Last night (1AM) he had left her a post saying 'suck a dick' and then she responded 'hey baby how are you? When are we smoking [BF smokes weed regularly, I know where this is headed. Next you're going to tell me what to do and say. How would you like it if i acted like this?! I don't give a fuck, I'm never changing myself for anyone' I calmly replied that I would never control his actions or say who he could hangout with- but that I feel so in the dark about his friendships due to the fact that I've never met these people. Also, regarding if he were to feel uncomfortable about my friendship with a member of the opposite sex, I told him that he knows and has met all of my close male friends! And i've never hooked up with them! What hurt me the most was when he said I was like every other girl he has dated, his exes were extremely verbally and emotionally abusive, I do nothing but care for and support him. A few hours later he apologized and said that he was just traumatized by his previous relationships and does not want a repeat.

So, even though he says these women know about me, I feel that he is trying to hide our relationship from his friends. I wonder if they know he is in a serious committed relationship.

Update: We left that house move to our own home a few states away. After spending all night awake and looking at her phone every hour

The times she offered me her phone she had deleted the offending messages first

We leave the house to stop by work and says that we should stop this guys work so the kids can say goodbye and I look at her like she has 3 heads. I tell her I'm going go into work for 5 minutes and that she can spend this time thinking about if that is a good idea. I get back in the car she says that that was a stupid thing to say. I tell her that now would be a good time to delete his number and everything from her phone. She had a pause and then proceeded. We spent seven hours in the car driving, we have sex and fall asleep.

So I take another look at her phone while she's sleeping find a picture of a text message that reads

I wake her and show her, which of course I do. And the conversation from 24 Jul shows up about how they talk discover their feelings. A mutual agreement is made to not tell me. And then a conversation from yesterday with her friend about me and his wife being told that my wife and the guy are in love. Her friend says ""did you use the words in love"" wife ""yes"". She told me an hour earlier that she just realized the emotional cheating that morning, I ask her how she thought maybe after discovering FEELINGS FOR EACH OTHER, how she didn't know and cut it off.

So this morning we have more driving

I know marriage counseling will help but how do I move past this. I can't kiss her now

Update: I pressed this morning for anything else that I should know. And so she tells they almost kissed but didn't on the 24

Update 2: I asked her phone when we got to our new place and told I was undeleting messages and she flipped out. She fought and screamed for the phone and did not want me on it.

---

My husband and I have been together for 7 years now; we were married in a courthouse 3 years ago and had our big ""official"" wedding a year ago. 

I moved down to Georgia for him 3 years ago because he was going to school here, come home at 10 or 11PM) and being new to the city, I was lonely and spent most of my time cooped up at home, getting frustrated. He would come home and expect me to have all the housework done because I didn't have ""as much to do as [he] does"". I chafed at this (I had lived with my parents before this) but eventually I got used to it and just did the housework without further complaint. 

Our second year together, training, and we kept in touch by calling, mail, and occasional visits. I was living alone in our apartment, and felt reasonably happy because I knew eventually he'd come back to me. He came home and then spent the rest of the year working at the local military base (part of his service) 5 days a week, normal 9 hours a day. Again I was annoyed that he didn't help out with the housework, while I was just a student and had way more free time on my hands. Well


Our third year together, so he made me quit dancing. In hindsight, it was a good idea because I did eventually get my focus together enough to finish my project, but it has never left me that when we fought about it, he said, ""you're not doing anything special, you're not a performer or anything. Guys aren't there to see you dance, a lot. I almost moved out at that point. But again


Throughout our time together in Georgia, cleaned, took care of the household duties, and was available for sex. I was on the verge of leaving him, but I read ""the five love languages"" and it really made a lot of sense, and gave me the vocabulary to express my feelings. I communicated this to him the best I could, and he thought it was ""retarded"", but he brushed it off as some ""obvious advice for dumbasses."" Nevertheless


Eventually I graduated. He had another semester to go, now at 3 nights a week and earning a pretty good amount of money. We don't have financial issues. He didn't like that I danced (""You didn't go to school to be a stripper"") but hey, it was stable and it brought in a good amount of money without taking up too much time. It didn't exclude me from pursing other job opportunities. He graduated this past semester, but decided to stay for his MS. We agreed that if I couldn't find a job here in Georgia, it would probably be best for me to move back home with  my parents where there were more job opportunities. 


Last month I started an internship in a different city a couple hours away, dishes still in the dishwasher from the last time I washed them, refrigerator decimated and him complaining about being hungry. I was annoyed by this - whatever happened to ""I work 5 days a week so I'm tired, you don't have as much to do""...? My internship got extended, so I moved on to renting a room in a house with a couple other women. I am finding that I am pretty darn happy on my own - I can take care of myself, and I can support myself easily on the money I earn from dancing (which I DO enjoy) while doing internship work to put on my resume. He doesn't have a job, other than going into the military base one weekend a month for training. After graduation, reading Reddit and Game of Thrones, he goes back to school to work on his project where he can focus better.


I really, it seems like he is not willing put forth the effort to work on our relationship. He is uncommunicative - he rarely answers my text messages with more than a single word, rarely tells me anything about his day or what he's doing. A minor, petty, materialistic thing that has bothered me for a while is the fact that he never got me an engagement ring, even though I was very clear that I wanted one. It wasn't that I wanted a huge diamond, or even a diamond at all -- I would have been happy with a CZ. I really just wanted him to pick *something* out for me to wear with pride. But he couldn't even make the effort to do that. ""What do you want a ring for anyway? It doesn't DO anything. You might as well buy a car with that money."" He later explained that he didn't want to spend the money on something he considered frivolous, he wanted to get me something nice

I don't think he's ready or able to take on the responsibilities of being a family together with me, and it's basically always boiled down to, ""just have them and give them to my mom and grandma to raise."" I know he's joking, but he was raised by his grandmother because his mother was a young parent, so there's probably a grain of truth to that statement.


I expressed all this to him last night, just leave me the cat."" His response to ""I think we need to go to marriage counseling"" and ""I'm thinking about a divorce"" was simply, ""K.""


I originally told him that I would come by next week to get my stuff, and it's hard for me to not stay. I don't want anyone else. One of the effects of my job as a dancer is that I meet a lot, a lot of men, and I have never met anyone that has piqued my interest enough to want to leave my husband. I'm pretty jaded when it comes to men. I still want to give him another chance. I'm hoping that maybe he'll realize how much he loves me with a little time and distance. I'm planning on coming back to our city and renting a separate room or apartment so he can have his space. Like I said, money isn't really an issue -- but I can't really afford to rent two places at once. Would it be mean of me to stop subsidizing his living costs? What else should I do?

So I've broken up with her, during which she asked me to come over. I agreed to this, packed her stuff that is at mine into a bag, and headed out. Whilst I'm stood at the station, I get a call from her. First she accused me of being bullshit for saying I was coming, despite being stood at the station. Then she told me to go home, as she ""wouldn't be there"" when I got there. Exchange went something like:

Me: Why won't you be there.

Her: I just won't.

Me: Where will you be.

Her: I just won't be there.

Me: Are you threatening suicide?

Her: -Noncommital comments-.

Eventually we hung up on each other, had BPD and depression, had means and generally probably wasn't kidding around.

I then headed home, feeling that I'm just going to get a load of bullshit. I glance at facebook occasionally while I'm with my friend, and see message popping up. I ignored them til I saw ""Unless you talk to me and tell me you're okay I'm coming round."" Which is naturally the last thing I want. So I end up getting roped into a phonecall.

The context of the phonecall was her wanting to know why, I found that hard to swallow). She also generally just insulted me a bit and was very angry with me. I think the prime one was me saying I didn't feel like I could ask her for time away from her to see my friends or whatever was me ""not being man enough"". In the end she basically told me that I owed her money for tickets for a show I was going to her with (which I agreed to - whatever will get her out of my hair at this point) and that she basically thought I was a massive dick.

Interesting point - no suicide threats. 

In the end, so hopefully it won't come back to haunt me. My mum is coming to collect me (as lame as that sounds) so I can have some time with the family to decompress from all this (My mother greeted me telling her about all this with a ""Can't you just get a normal girlfriend"" line, which did cheer me up a bit).

I honestly feel like I called her bluff a little with the suicide thing - there hasn't been another mention and I think she's more angry at me than anything else. Honestly

Not sure if anyone cares

As for the situation


I am a person who likes to always learn from negative situations.  From this situation I took two lessons.  One, and many of them just because we have some different values, not necessarily one person is right and another is wrong.  Lesson #2 I learned was that I should be far more respectful and dilligent of other people's possessions, even if it's the smallest most insignificant thing.  You never know what is important.  Yeah, my friend should have taken better notice to tell me this pen was important.  But I also should have paid more attention.  Listen, I know I lose pens horribly so to be honest I shouldn't have asked to borrow one if I knew chances were high I would lose it.  Even if it weren't an important pen, it's still just damn annoying for someone to borrow your pen and lose it.  What if that was the last pen she had on hand?  That was rude of me and I won't do it again.  I guess I discovered a bit of selfishness I have that I didn't even realize I have and so I'm glad this opened my eyes to it.  At the same time

In our previous talks he latched on to the idea that he needed to spend more time with me rather than the parts where I asked him to spend less time with her, but after last night we've set some good boundaries in place and are going to continue on in our pretty incredible relationship.


-----------------------------------------


For starters we have what has always been an excellent relationship: extremely loving


He is still doing his undergrad, which was something we originally did together, with her several times a week before or after they were to have class together.


Our first confrontation about their friendship occurred when he had plans to head to the movies with her and his other new friends. I was not invited, but didn't want to tell him not to see her anymore since I was glad he was branching out socially.


Several weeks passed and I continued to feel extremely anxious about their relationship. I began to feel that it bordered on inappropriate considering how close they had become in such a short period of time. After spending weeks pouring a lot of effort into him and feeling that it was going unreciprocated, that it especially bothered me when he and I were spending time together and he was texting her, and that I wasn't feeling loved in light of this. He apologized profusely, and promised to make a better effort. His main concern seemed to be that I didn't trust him, but I assured him that I knew he wouldn't cheat on me.


I felt better after this conversation but this is where I entered into the cycle that I'm in now: we have a talk


I've also been trying to make an effort to become friends with this girl: we had her and her roommate over for dinner last week which went very well


The turning point for writing this post happened today when I read a text between them. I was using his phone when a text came in


Am I right to confront him again about the inappropriateness of their relationship or should I look into seeing someone to help me with my jealousy issues?


ALSO as an aside: our sex life has been excellent throughout all of this

We talked, we stay flatemates and our friendship is stronger than before. 

___________________________________________________________________________________________


Better late than never:
After the discussion with you Redditors I strongly felt that something had to be done. I started by telling some close friends about my situation. They know him and me
Each and every one of my friends agreed with the following:
* They would not have guessed that I fell in love with him
* They did not think that the feelings were mutual.
* I should have told him before signing the contract for the new appartement.

Some of my friends (I told only three persons in November/December, most of them did not give any advice but offered a lot of help and let me make my own descisions. 

December felt like a short time with all that moving, but in January...
In January I strongly felt that I should tell him. Not because I thought he might feel the same
Two people living together are driven by other dynamics as three people. New boundaries had to be defined, I got highly emotional, not because the situation itself, but because I felt that he could not understand me and my feelings. 

The other reason to tell him was of course fairness. He was not free in his decision whether to move in with me or not

So I made a decision, 1.2. happend. 
It was a dance night (hard rock), wild, funny, perverted) and of course practically ate him with my eyes to remember -just in case- how it used to be. 
He went skiing after that (drunken) night (did I mention the part after the dancing
(*this is not unusual in our friendship and he could have getten rid of me easely if he wanted to

I figured that it would not be such a surpise to him after what happend and as I was too much of a chicken to tell him Wednesday

We talked Thursday evening. Quiet

He did only notice it on said Friday, well, we were both drunk...""
And for the first time since November I felt like myself again. We laughed

It has never been awkward since (yeah I know, feel like I've lost something (that last bit of irrational hope and a very sweet secret), I feel this is healthy. It's part of letting go of my love and everything feels very right. 
The talk had the best possible outcome, too. I needed time to analyse my own feelings, getting inputs from my friends and to find the words for what was bugging me (not the being in love part, but the part where this love gets a danger to our friendship). 
And as my mother put it: a friendship that can handle this much trouble

Thank you all for your feedback. There was a lot of eye-opening conversations

We have been talking via phone about the weekend over the last two days (Monday/Tuesday).   

I basically told him that behavior like this will end our relationship.  I said he had been looking at this weekend mostly as how it affected him, that he threw at me during it. I told him that I have given and will continue to give my friends, male or female, both verbal and physical affections and he needs to understand that those affections are platonic in nature. I also preempted a lot of his responses by saying that if he cannot deal with that, and he states that I need to cease it in order to continue dating him, I will see it as controlling behavior on him part, and is a sign that we are incompatible and need to stop seeing each other. 

I stated that this weekend was either a really large bump in the road or the beginning of the end of our relationship, even in the ""heat of the moment,"" this will be over and I will just hang up and never contact him again.

BF volunteered some information yesterday evening that made me feel positive about him understanding how out-of-line his behavior was.  He said he had been doing a lot of reading about how jealousy and jealous behavior affects the other people in the relationship

I think this is very self-aware behavior and he is truly contrite about it, it was volunteered.

Six months ago, about six hours a day. No compensation, that's fine...she's my niece, and I love being with her.

Now, but she is not my child...I want a weekend to myself, not taking care of an almost 18 month old that I did not birth myself.

My sister and her husband have always been big party animals. I have heard so many stories of them doing the dumbest shit and thinking it was hilarious because they were so wasted at the time. I have honestly always found it annoying. Before they had their daughter, now that this child is walking/running around the earth...I feel that things need to change and they are not.

When I first started taking care of my niece, they moved in with their two best friends who have and 8 year old. They do not believe in immunizations at all. So my 18 month old niece is around a kid who has no immunizations and is at daycare or school all day. They don't have a problem with this, but I DO!

Well

Last weekend, but would it be ok if I kept the baby til Monday so she could get some sleep....mind you, her husband DID NOT WORK ON SUNDAY! He was too hungover/fucking lazy to come get his daughter and spend time with her.
They missed spending Easter with her. Then my sister got all butt hurt when I showed her the pictures of me and her daughter dying eggs together...well

I cannot fit all I want to say into this post. It will turn into a novel. I just feel like I am being taken advantage of/they are being fucking lazy. I wish I could adopt my niece

**TL;DR**: I do not get along with my husband's cousin

First

Okay, as well as Spanish and English. Tlapanec is the primary language within his family/community [A/N I speak Spanish and English. Not Tlapanec]. He also has a very close relationship with his cousin F. It all started when she took him in to her home with her two kids and husband. He stayed with her for ~3 years. She made him godfather of her kids, which is a culturally heavy responsibility. 


Okay

I didn't think anything except that I needed more to go off of to judge them. I thought maybe they were just nervous or shy so I let him keep taking me there thinking that they would warm up to me. 

Now, F. All of a sudden, she was overstepping her boundaries on me. I left a few of my things over there [next to his bed], and we both realized that she would go through everything in his space because things would be moved around. There was even one time that I was taking a shower, and she went through my phone. It was around this time that my husband was also revealing to me that she was accusing me of not being true to him, I'm out to get him and use him and that going out with my friends is inappropriate and means I'm looking for men. What!? Where was this coming from!? I never went out on the town with friends;  we always settled somewhere and played videogames. There's no way she ever saw me out because I rarely went out on the town because of work and then time with my husband. It was just hurtful and untrue, all around. 

All of it ended pretty badly. After he and I got married

**Currently**: She really uses the Godfather title she gave to my husband, to eat with us when she doesn't feel like cooking, when she needs to me translate things for her from her kids' school, when she needs to borrow money, when she feels like they haven't talked in a while, when she needs a ride to go to the store, etc. She says her husband is working so he can't do these things for her. 

She really likes to come over unannounced, physically fight, and get into our food. When we tell them no, they also like to ask over and over until we say yes. She yells at them with empty threats all the time. She'll tell them that they're leaving but will continue to visit with my husband for hours before they actually do leave, so her kids never listen to her. 

One big problem is me not knowing how to address to my husband that she needs to have boundaries enforced. He's told me that he feels guilty telling her ""no"" and will lie to her to get off her hook instead of telling her ""no"". This also includes him standing up to her when she is nasty concerning me. I am well aware that she keeps it up because he didn't tell her to stop. What he would do is passively ignore her and pretend he didn't hear what she said. I've watched her chew him out and he won't stop her but sit there and ignore her while watching TV.

It wasn't the pot and alcohol we were really concerned about, along with the sex and nude photos/sexting. 

So the night we found out I took a taxi to my mother's house and went and talked to my little sister. She was laying in her room on her bed crying. She told me she was depressed, and I understood being depressed as I've been there but she had to get her shit together and that she couldn't expect everyone to just pity her. She had to admit to fucking up and own up to it. 

She acknowledged this and said she wanted our mother to trust her and that she felt our mother had been neglecting her. I told her that if she wanted trust she was going to have to work her ass off to do so.
I told her I would talk to our mother about the neglect and B made me promise not to tell her about the depression and bulimia

At this point I tell her to pack her stuff because our mother was so upset she didn't want to talk to her anymore

There both A and I talked to B more and she really seemed to want to get it together. She said she wanted to break up with her boyfriend

A few weeks ago I took B Christmas shopping and we talked a bit. She told me a girl at school had been spreading rumors about her and calling her a slut. I flat out asked her if that was true. She denied it and said the girl was just kind of crazy and they used to be friends but aren't anymore. I gave her some advice and she seemed fine.

Tonight

B had been at A's apartment and had gone on FB (which she has been grounded from for months since everything came out) and was offering to give some boy a blowjob in a McD's bathroom

A called our mother and told her

but we really don't know what to do. She's been grounded, offered our advice, told her we'll listen when she needs it, but it's clearly not working.

1375667868.0,1jppyx,Boyfriend [26M] dumped me [29F] after 6 years when he was about to immigrate. Blindsided.,6yearsfornothing,134,24,60,"I was dumped about a month ago by my boyfriend of 6 years in a complete blindside.  We have been long distance for the majority of that

We agreed I'd live with him in the USA for three months.  However, it wasn't a hardship).  Before moving to the USA I saw a therapist weekly as I have clinical depression and generalized anxiety disorder.  It was something I worried about (not having my weekly session) but I was willing to move for love and prove we worked well together.

I lived in the USA for six months with him.  Things were good, it made me CRAZY).  I didn't know anyone, and my boyfriend worked nights at the hospital, 6 days on 1 off, 6 days off 1 on.  He was usually asleep during the day when things were open, and at night he had my car for work.  It was hard being away from my family and therapist, but I made it.  I met and loved his family

We drove back to Canada together, we celebrated him submitting his immigration papers and the official wait period beginning (6-12 months) til we lived together once again.

A few days later we found out that he failed his registry test - by one point.  We had a gigantic fight about this.  Prior to the test, AND I'd paid for it (about $1100). I lashed out and said he'd wasted my money.  In response he asked for some space because he found me mean and offensive, kicking him when he's down.  I felt furious because it was exactly what I had said was going to happen (you'll fail if you don't study at home too!), and then he expected me to be sympathetic toward him.

So, I am well off, and jobs are very difficult to find in his area - he's one of 2 students in his graduation class that found a job.  I was stunned - didn't see it coming.  We've had much bigger fights and it just felt off to me somehow.

I then sent a mail to the immigration lawyer (again, what?  Yeah, he hadn't submitted them.  He'd been lying about it, long before us having that fight - at least two weeks, maybe as long as a month.  But if this was planned, why did he sell all of our furniture and give away all our household items back in the USA?  He was dreading moving back in with his parents.  If he had been planning to do this in advance, he could have avoided a cross country road trip and found a new place to rent there and not have to buy literally everything again to move out.  So I'm so confused as to what caused all of this.

When I tried to help him initially with immigration stuff

A week after I got dumped I read an article on Borderline Personality Disorder and brought it to my therapist, and the living situation in the USA definitely exacerbated that.

Basically, and this is so much to deal with.  We haven't spoken other than completely civilly to work out certain things (he sent me back the money I gave him for his emergency/immigration fund, we've mailed each other back some stuff left at one another's places) but I feel like I'm losing my mind.  I also turn 30 soon and I'm feeling like I lost all of my 20s with this man that now seems to not give two fucks about me.  It's heartbreaking and I feel like shit.  His best friend says he hasn't even talked to her about me, so it seems like he isn't taking it hard at all, which makes me feel like I've been stabbed in the gut.  I'm trying my best to move on, but I feel like my world has collapsed.  I apologize this is so long, but it is a complicated situation.

TL;DR (From the last Post) She brings up swinging




The original post and subsiquent disscussion turned into more of a wake up call for me than advice on whether or not I did something wrong. After really doing some soul searching I realized I was a part of an abusive relationship with my Wife. Her hitting me


Following many of you giving me really good advice I decided to confront my wife about all of these things. I have only had one conversation and we plan to have a few more. 

The first conversation has gone like this (we are still texting after being face to face for lunch).... Her James (fake name) ""you are not even trying to make what you did better""/ ""You hurt me and make me feel inadequate etc.""/""You won't say you love me or hug me"".

Me ""I now totally understand why you feel the way you do (I went on to show her how I empathize)""/""However the way you went about asking me if it was you that was the cause of a lacking sex life (swinging) I do not agree with""

Her ""Good and you were mean to me""/""You made me feel bad about myself"" etc. more bull

Me I apologized then went for the throat. ""You hit me and you've done it before""/It's not exeptable, but what you did was far more serious than anything I've done and needs to be dealt with"" No shit I said that.

Me ""You have done this before

Now she is pretty much asking me to promise to stay with her. I told her I would never make her promise to stay with me through something like this for both of our sakes. 

I will be updating when I can Thank you for all the help

TL;DR We are hashing it out. I realized I am in an abusive relationship and I confronted her about the abuse. I have told her that it is her job to make this better and she is showing some signs of trying.

**TL;DR: Forced to sleep outside by my boyfriend's parents. I feel disrespected

Boyfriend and I are both 21, and things are smashing.

My boyfriend hasn't lived with his family in a year - parents are ultra religious, but we figured this was a different case because
a) we were invited over
b) it was a special occasion

We stay up til 3am hanging out, at which point they tell us we need to go somewhere else, because they're going to sleep. (Important note: we live an hour and a half away, and don't have any money or a car. No chance for a hotel, and the family moved to this town after BF was already in college, so he has no contacts there.) Can't we just crash on the couch, boyfriend asks? **There are two couches and several spare bedrooms, the mosquitoes are ridiculous

The night was miserable (as I mentioned, and I was forced to get up at 8am and spend the rest of the day playing nice to the adults who were ice-cold to us last night, who note our lack of sleep but don't apologize.

They are usually over-the-top nice to both of us (constantly forcing food/gifts on us), and they basically guilt-tripped boyfriend and I into coming a day early (instead of taking the train in the morning). 
I'm pissed at them for being so stubborn, they wouldn't be in my life. But here's another thing - I'm fighting with them now over similar issues to my boyfriend and his parents (difference of religious views, independence, etc), but they've been more than clear throughout that I am still welcome at home whenever I choose. 

**So my question: am I overreacting?** Should I be comparing them to my parents? If I choose to use this incident to significantly cut my (not his) time spent with his family (which feels like the best option right now to my wounded ego)

There are too many times before that to count. It wasn't all the time. Not even most of the time. But when it did happen

I went to the courthouse this afternoon and filed the paperwork for a Victim's Protective Order against him. My hands were shaking so badly I'm not even sure if what I wrote was legible. The judge decided this incident wasn't severe enough for an emergency order

I'm wondering why, scratches, scrapes, hateful nasty names and emotional abuse, after being abandoned in a strange city with no phone and no money, after having my glasses, computer and countless other belongings broken, right? But the permanency of the VPO terrifies me. I know deep down this is the best thing for my daughter and I

TL;DR: I filed a Victim's Protective Order against my live-in boyfriend today and am kind of freaking out about it now. 

EDIT: Wow, encouraging words. I can't tell you how much I appreciate them. I'm still feeling sort of sick, anxious, scared and overwhelmed. I'm afraid of what this will do my my financial situation. I'm afraid of losing the man who was, at one point, my best friend. I'm afraid to move forward because he's been a part of my life since I moved to my current city and it feels so foreign to think of being here without him. But after 4 years, I know it's not going to get any better. I think so many of you hit the nail on the head when you said that he's sort of brainwashed me into not trusting my own judgement. I've threatened to file a vpo against him before and he just laughed at me and said ""go for it."" 

Normally, cool off and then things would slowly go back to being okay. At least until the next fight. That was our cycle. Breaking it is terrifying to me. Even more terrifying in some ways than seeing his rage filled eyes and knowing what's coming next. I know so many people out there don't understand this and it's comforting to find a community where I'm not judged or scolded. Thank you all again. ",,False,,t5_2qjvn,1361637504.0,,

He was never a major talker

He's a good person.  He's never beat me, very much.  But I feel almost nothing for him anymore.  I think he's attractive but have no desire to have sex with him.  When I do have sex with him, it's because I think ""I haven't done this in awhile, I probably should.""  I don't kiss him and much of the time I just want him to fuck me from behind and get it over with as fast as possible.  I know that sounds horrible.  He's not a very affectionate person, but I don't even really want the small gestures he makes.

I think he's a good person, and now it doesn't even feel like that anymore.  It feels like we are roommates who happen to sleep in the same bed, but are not involved with each other except for logistics.  I know r/relationships is going to suggest counseling, but is it even worth it?  Couple's counseling only works if the couple wants the same thing out of it, and I'm not sure we would want the same thing to come out of counseling.

If it weren't for our child, ""Don't you ever try to take _____ away from me or we will fight.""  I'd never take our child away from him.  He is a good father.  We own a house together that neither of us could probably afford on one of our incomes. 

I know that love changes in long term relationships.  That you will not  always have the sexual excitement, but I think your partner should be your best friend then.  I don't feel like he is even a ""friend"" let alone my best friend.  I know none of this is his ""fault.""

I'm a 22 year old male who has never been in a relationship before. Without going into a great deal of detail, personable, likeable guy without any major social defects, but my lack of relationship experience is due to a complex set of life circumstances. However, I'm finally to a place where my life is more or less normal; I live in my own place in a college town, have a career, a healthy number of friends, etc.

Six weeks ago, I told her how I felt, and asked if there was potential for a more serious relationship.  She told me that she had developed feelings for me too, but that she was at the end of a very long and serious relationship, and although she knew that the breakup was imminent and had been for some time, she was, at the time, I understand

Fast forward a week.  She breaks up with her BF.  Goes through a  bit of a rough patch mourning for this relationship and I'm just kind of there for her.  After some time passes

So I take her out and we have a fantastic time.  After dinner, and as things are going along, she stops me.  A bit confused, we start start to talk about it.  She asks me more about my experience and I answer truthfully... am I virgin?  Yes.  Have I ever been in a serious relationship before? No.  Have I ever even kissed anyone before?  No.  She seems shocked and taken aback.  I ask her if this bothers her and she answers truthfully that it's a little weird.  Eventually she asks me to take her home and we talk about it some more.  To make a long story short, she tells me that given the end of her long and serious relationship, she isn't ready to enter a serious committed relationship again right away, and given my inexperience, we agree to just be friends.  

Well, she texts me ""I wanted to kiss you today, that's what I couldn't tell you...""  So at this point, I'm confused, because we spent a long time discussing it and she had told me that we couldn't make it work.  So, given this we talk some more about it, and I end up basically saying that I like her too much to let this go, and she ends up saying that ""as long as we can keep it casual

This was about a week ago.  Since then we've hung out a lot, made out, hung out, and that's about it.  We have a very flirtateous rapport, but given the fact that I've agreed to be ""casual,"" I now feel like I'm walking on eggshells because I don't want to scare her off by making things seem too serious.

How do casual relationships work?  What is a difference, is that acceptable?  Is she my ""girlfriend"" or not?  How do I introduce her to people?  Would it be inappropriate to want to introduce her to my friends and family?  Are romantic gestures like flowers and gifts off limits because it's too serious?  How fast should I move sexually?  If I had my way, I'd spend every minute of every day with her, but I'm trying to give her space so that she doesn't feel smothered... how often is it reasonable to expect to spend time with her?  A date every weekend and dinner one weeknight per week?  More?  Less?  I dont want to look overly eager, nor do I want to misrepresent the fact that I'm really interested.  I realize saying things like ""I love you"" is not appropriate, but where is the limit?  

Is it unreasonable to want/expect this to turn into something more serious down the road?  What is a reasonable timeframe for that?  

ANY and ALL advice, so whatever you have to say will definitely be helpful.

Don't say OP never delivered. I (finally) went with option 2 and told her husband (who I knew outweighed me by 60 lbs)

I tried to give her another chance and believe that she really was just in a tough position and wanted to leave her husband, and seemed to ""prove it"" with a txt msg convo, so I was willing to (stupidly) try again. It didn't end well.

I decided today that enough was enough because she still was playing games about leaving and finding a job that would allow her to support herself. Coupled with this was the fact that her husband was getting very suspicious and for the first time today I felt like I had to watch my back before I got into my car. That was enough. He deserved the truth

I went over to her place

I called him up and asked if he would like to talk, but I didn't want to risk being inside with an angry husband. To his credit, he didn't hold much anger toward me, just his wife.

What I found out is that she had been sleeping with both of us the entire time. Here is the shocker, it was likely his, and he didn't know. She swore up and down (a couple months ago) that there was no way it could be his, and that she hadn't slept with him since we met. She ""proved"" this with a txt msg convo which I now believe was just her using both of their phones and/or deleting other txts to make it seem like that was the answer. The reason I was so suspicious that it could be my child was because I had only cum inside her twice, and it was when she was on the rag. The other reason was that the timing of conception was when he was home for a week and I hadn't been with her.

So anyway, and then was planning on moving in with me on monday, filing for divorce, and staying with me until she found work. I can't even imagine how morally bankrupt she has to be to do what she did to both of us. Bullet dodged...sorta.

Also leaves me all the time and says won't talk to me if I'm crying.",heartofstone,160,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/vpf1c/when_i_tell_my_bf_that_the_things_he_does_hurts/

My bf (M 23) and I (F21) have been dating 1 yr 10 months and living together for 1 yr.   We typically have fun together but every week or so get into arguments that escalate quickly.  I have noticed a certain trend in our arguments

1)  He does something to upset me, he says ""you shouldn't cry over that/really, you're REALLY crying over that?"" or he justifies that what he did to make me upset was fine, therefore I shouldn't be upset.  And I am left still upset obviously and it goes on and on or he walks out.

2)  He upsets me, tells me ""I'm not hanging out with you if you're acting like that"" or just leaves and does something else while I cry.  For example, he will play games on the computer, or once when we were grocery shopping, just told me to go home and said he wasn't going to shop with me like this.  I said that I'd stop crying and go shopping, but he said no.  Like a bitch, I walked home.

Most of the time what upsets me in the first place is his tone, leaving me in tears.  Or its something like he called me retarded or dumb or acting childish.  When we argue with each other we both get a mean tone and might raise our voice but I always avoid direct accusations or name calling.  When I tell him it hurts me that he calls me names, he just responds with ""I didnt call you stupid, I said you were ACTING stupid.""  I tell him it hurts nonetheless and he just tells me that I'm irrational and he's unable to talk to me when I'm like this (although I am the only one keeping a good tone and not insulting the other, I even try to hold his hand while talking to ease things) and that I just talk about how I feel and he talks about the facts of the matter.  

Pretty much every time I confront him, or I go to him asking if we can truly talk about things without arguing.  He always ends up hurting me much much more because he tells me I'm not an adult, a 10 yr old wouldn't cry over the things I do, Im trolling him except trolls are smart, Im crazy and retarded.  Instead of reacting in anger I try to tell him, here, that wasn't cool, I'm trying so hard.  He doesn't think so of course.  

Anyhow (sorry I think I am ranting), sends me home) or refuses to talk to me because I'm crying, it really fucking hurts because I feel like my bf should be trying to see whats wrong, helping me not be upset since I'm upset about him.  Instead he gives me arguments that he is acting adult by walking away and that he's not going to support me if two of the following are occurring: ""having a temper tantrum, don't have a legitimate reason to be crying, or if hes mad"".

This makes me incredibly upset because of course he never things I'm crying for a legit reason.  I admit I am really sensitive but people are just different in regards to sensitivity.  Something that would make me cry, if he's mad at me (for ruining his day by crying) he says that he will not be nice, thus excusing his name calling and rude behavior, and he Definitely will not want to help me through the suffering he's put me through by consoling me if he's mad.

Basically, only knowing that if I'm upset, he is out of the game.  Obviously I think relationships are more than that.  Hours later, I am begging him to just be nice to me, not be a little lawyer with me (picking at my arguments) but just see the msg that I am sending - that he is hurting me.  He will argue this for awhile, saying that he is going to be mean since I made him mad.  Then I just give up, cry alone and he will come over and say ""you know I love you.  Sorry for being mean to you earlier"" and its all done for him.  But for me

I don't want to break up with him but I feel he isn't there for me when I need it most.  What do I do?  Am I too sensitive?  Even if I am

TLDR:  My bf always opts out of my careful conversation if I am crying.  This opting out or walking out devastates me.  When he comes back he just does more to hurt me (name call

EDIT:  Wow... Thank you everyone for your feedback
1)  I don't cry over every little thing.  Before I met him I might just get into an argument and cry like twice a year.  My sensitivity was much stronger in my teen years but ever since I've been with him
2)  I was unclear for the sake of trying to be short - I didn't cry while grocery shopping.  I cried in the parking lot, at this point I was pretty upset just cos we clearly weren't okay and he hadn't looked at me even once on the way down to notice anything off about me.  I should've just said Hey lets talk, but I instead quietly cried.  He sent me to walk home after only just arriving and not having even entered the store.  This was the only time I got upset in ""public.""
3)  Obviously this is probably biased since it is me telling the story.  I can assure you
4)  We typically argue about bullshit like, THEN garden, not garden THEN run"" (he felt he was doing me a favor by gardening with me so he wanted to do things in the order in which he wanted; I felt like it was my only day off cos I work and go to school whereas he has no job and doesn't go to school.  I also didn't realize he felt he was doing me such a big favor since we enjoy gardening).  The argument which prompted me to post about these reoccurring events, was that he has told me he would quit smoking weed and cigarettes for the past 4 months but he's only frustrated me so much over the past months cos every other night he'd ask for weed (its my weed - long story but I get it for free, don't really smoke at all but can't say no to free shit).  Anyhow I asked him if I could smoke a cigarette (I don't smoke, just wanted to take it) but I took his last two and destroyed them.  He said I lied and violated our trust.  I said I was frustrated.  Just escalated from there.

As I write this I am asking myself ""who is this pussy who can't stand up to his girlfriend?"", yet it truly is how I feel. I don't suffer in silence; we discuss things, but derail the conversation and it deteriorates fast. She escalates things without a second thought - shouting/tears/sulking and it's just impossible to deal with. 

I can't say the words to her ""I don't want to be with you any more"". I know it sounds weak as fuck but she would somehow twist things and I would end up apologising. I always apologise for everything. She is never happy; ""why don't we ever do X?""

All I can think of to do is get in my car and leave. Please help me reddit.

Edit: thank you all. I am going to talk to her in the morning (midnight approaches here) and if it goes badly I am out the door.

Edit 2: This rather blew up whilst I slept! Going through it now

Having given this type of talk before

I believe that there is something else driving her drinking. For the first three years of this relationship

UPDATE PART 2: She had a talk with one of her friends, that I should have someone in my life more intelligent, and that these feelings spread to her family and job. So she's got low self-esteem.

I have told her that it's no longer about the relationship, to see a therapist. We're going to take it from there.

1376473215.0,1kc812,[UPDATE] Me[32F] with my husband [31M] of two years. Something really weird happened. I'm creeped out and don't know what to think.,throwmeaway7714,144,32,43,"Previous thread [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1k2y5z/me32f_with_my_husband_31m_of_two_years_something/)
 
First, I read every comment, a few times, and tried to let everything fully absorb.

Here's where I'm at. I'm not ready to leave him. I see the abuse. I know it's there. But I also know he's sick, well I know enough to know there's an end line. I will not stay in an abusive relationship forever, but I feel the need to exercise all of the options considering the mental illness aspect of it all.

That being said

So I called my mom yesterday.

This was a tough conversation for me to have. I feel I've essentially lied to my family for years about my life. And I have. I try to live my life as honestly as possible

It was a tearful conversation. On both sides. I let her know the true state of my marriage and where I was at. She was a bit blindsided

I feel ashamed and embarrassed that I am in this situation. I told her she could tell my brother what was going on, and this just feels like one huge, fat failure.

If my marriage ends, but I knew it wouldn't be easy. I shouldn't have married this guy and I... just... feel like a huge failure.

So I'm trying to make this right.

Opening up to my family was a first step. I don't know what's next but I know that it already feels like a huge weight has been lifted in talking to my mom.

Next step is getting back into therapy. I realized that there must be some reason I allowed myself to get into a relationship like this is the first place. So time to figure out why. I have an appointment set for the end of the week and I'm hoping I can figure some shit out.

Again

I'm in graduate school, because my band has been working hard over the past few years to become successful, and we never really took time to celebrate how far we've come.  

Anyway, so she had to go.  I told her I was a little irritated by this.  Any other night I wouldn't mind hanging with her friends, but I felt it was like her telling me she wanted to hang out with her friends on my birthday.  It was me and my band's night.  

Anyway, and my friends ask me where my gf is, and I tell them we got into a fight.  I know I probably shouldn't have said this, but it was pretty obvious I wasn't in a good mood, and people kept asking.  She called me a few times about 15 minutes later yelling at me, telling me she hated me, texted me that I was an asshole, and a bunch of other really mean stuff.  I never say anything

Anyway, a bit more calm, and she says she's alone on the street and wants me to get her.  She's really drunk at this point, and she says she can't walk to my car and needs a cab.

My wife Susan (25) and I (25) met freshman year of college but didn't officially begin dating until junior year. We were both immediately and immensely involved with each other, shared their past feelings, and she revealed to me later that they had kissed. For a while she was torn between us, but after learning that Max had just returned to his ex-girlfriend she decided to stick it out with me.

Eventually Max faded from her mind as Susan and I both drew closer to each other. She took me home with her a few months later and somehow we both met up with Max. Low and behold we all hit it off together and became good friends. One year later

The next year was a crazy jumble of relocations, we moved to NYC for a contract job I had, and somehow, in a matter of months, returned to Susan's hometown in California.

Max, after I found a well paying job, Susan and I found our own house to rent and every weekend it was filled with music, friends, and of course, a quantity of alcohol.

My birthday arrived

The next week passed and my wife grew increasingly distant. I eventually called her out on it and she broke down in tears. She revealed that after the birthday party Max and her talked about their feelings, she told me, they kissed.

Torn once again, knowing this emotional relationship was very real, felt torn. I had a break-down that week and even tried to take her wedding ring, resulting in a painful slap and an evening on the couch. I talked to Max the next day and told him I knew they were both in love. His response was a simple ""I'm sorry dude.""

After talking to my wife we both decided to try to make it work. We kicked Max out of our lives.

How was I to expect Max would then decide to O.D. on heroin?
Susan fell into a deep depression for some time after that, to talk to him again.

I told him what happened in the past is a different story

Max however soon relocated out of town, ""They fucked man."" ""It's true,"" another said, ""They had sex."" Apparently Max had told them this, and suddenly my wife's admission seemed even more vague in retrospect.

I was crushed

Then New Years arrived. My friend Brittany (who was at my birthday party) was in town and came over. Late that night she told me it wasn't just on my birthday that my wife and Max had been having sex, and she revealed that she had always had feelings for me too.

Despite my own sensibilities and loyalty, but we kissed urgently and passionately. Something I hadn't felt in a while.

Brittany returned to school and now I'm left with a lot to think about.
I didn't tell Susan about the kiss, but spends most of her time looking at houses or another dog to adopt. The only time we are alone is at night, and even then we are separated by a dog. Our conversations revolve around how I need to do the dishes, garbage, mail her orders, etc. And when I miss one of the utility bills she scolds me, rather than appreciate I pay them at all, she scolds me once again. Max meanwhile is getting a realty degree

My place in her life seems to be growing smaller each day. I feel more of just a provider than a partner or friend. Although I wasn't faithful recently

**Our Wonderful Relationship**

We have been together for almost a year and it has been completely blissful. I love her more than I have loved anything and from what I can tell she really loves me too. I try really hard in this relationship

I will always make her a cup of tea when she needs it, meet her when ever and where ever she wants, will always listen (without butting in), excuse her occasional laziness around our home and do most of the cleaning (without being a dick about it), I earn quite a bit more than her so I generally pay for things and I'm doing this to help her get on top of student debts and stuff. Most of all I respect her, I think she is a truly wonderful and strong woman, we're both pretty serious feminists. You get it, but I really do try to be as good as I can for her

We have never had any arguments really, we hate spending time apart and haven't slept in separate beds since February 13th (I know it's sad that I know that but she does too and we giggle unbearably when either of us mention that). 

Oh my god don't even get me started on the sex! It is amazing, own a cat together, are spending Christmas together, getting married in June and for after that, planning to move to New Zealand and having kids. Neither of us are new to this relationship business or feel like we are rushing, we have both had a couple of serious relationships in the past (I was with a girl for 7.5 years) and she was engaged to a dude who didn't really treat her very well, as long as her having a lot of fun whilst she was at Uni!


**How I Know What I Know**

Back in April I was laying in bed watching my beautiful SO getting ready for work, I'm in room whatever..."". I scrolled up to get some context and couldn't make sense of it, All I could see was that they have met before in hotels, have a long text history. 

To be perfectly clear, I hadn't pieced together much of anything then, all I knew was friendly man meeting my girlfriend, secretly, in a hotel. 

When I bought this up with her she later on (instead of stalking her and calling the number of the guy texting her I might add), it was cool that we scored a few hundred quid and we got a pizza.

Cue a couple of months later. Same dude, whatcha doin', or something like that. I saw enough in those few seconds to know what was going to happen. I asked her about it, got a little upset saying that I asked her just to be honest about this in the future. She said she was going to tell me but it just hadn't crossed her mind.

A couple of months after that, the good friend of my fiancée who has been nothing but nice to me. Who am I to judge? I even gave her another opportunity in the nicest possible way whilst having a walk saying, be honest, have you ever done or considered doing escort work. She laughed and said of course not, she didn't think she'd be capable of doing it.


**The Climax of How I Now Know for Sure**

I overheard my lady and Jess talking about something at a party whilst a bit drunk. I didn't hear much but I heard them talking about a ""Stan"" (not his real name) and an initial (not ""S"") in the same breath, and I thought I heard that he was going to be coming up. This all happened on Friday. I didn't want to be that paranoid boyfriend, I didn't want to just start answering ridiculous questions again. I just sat on what I thought I heard and tried to be skeptical and rational about it. Every time I went over anything in my head I remembered how she acted slightly strangely with her responses and I thought at the time that could be a sign of lying but I wasn't sure if I was just remembering this wrong. 

Finally

I saw messages from Jess about this Stan guy where she said that the hotel she was taken to in London recently with another client was really nice and quite a lot like where Stan used to take them, ""I know you are spoken for but I thought I should ask"", and ""They weren't expecting anything, well at least not the previous night but things might change"", and ""I will obviously give you cash for this"". I froze and felt sick. She replied saying she wasn't sure if she would go but then said, ""only if you come round and help me dress up"". I checked out the dates that this went on and I honestly think she didn't go ahead with this. I can't remember exactly what I and we were doing that evening.

I looked further through her messages and read the single message on her phone that was there by Stan addressing both my fiancée and Jess by their initials

I didn't know what to do at this point. I was guilt stricken because I couldn't trust her enough to not go through her phone but at the same time distraught about the whole escort thing. I woke her

When any specifics came up she was reluctant to say anything too specific. We talked it through without actually really mentioning the whole escort thing to a point where we were both saying we love each other and that we both want to try to make it work and it sucks. I was scared she was going to leave me. I asked her if we could still talk about the escort thing when things were more calm

We finally went to bed

The really upsetting part is that it is my birthday very soon and we were going to go away for a weekend starting with a gig. She became quickly reluctant about this about the time the message from Stan came saying she wasn't sure if she could get the time off work to leave early enough and seemed weird when I said I didn't care

You know what, not telling me straight up, even before we started getting really serious, even when I gave her a number of opportunities framed with the sincere phrase, ""I wouldn't be angry with you"".


**My Question**

What the fuck do I do Reddit? I am lost. This relationship means everything to me. She seems so honest and sincere in all the nice things she tells me and tells her friends. They all get on with me really well and are so lovely to me because she truly does speak highly of me to everyone (which means she really cares right?). I don't think any of her other friends know about any of this and though Jess is a good friend

How should I approach talking to her? She doesn't do arguing well so I don't want to be on the attack otherwise she will end up being on the attack or become to upset and we won't get anything sorted. I hate conflict so much. How can I make it up to her for reading her messages? I guess my biggest concern is that she has had some emotional problems in the past and I really don't want to trigger another downward spiral in her

Just fucking say some words Reddit. I need something right now.

Thank you so much for being there.

Hi Reddit - Longtime lurker


This will probably be a novel
My boyfriend [53] and I [26] are both chronically ill. The age gap doesn't bother me whatsoever, as I'm just too sick and haven't the energy.


I cannot work. I cannot do something as simple as spend a day at the mall, which is an important piece of information. Most of my friends from the past won't speak to me anymore, understandably, as the updates of 'Hey, how are you?' 'Still sick' got a bit old.


I am American. He is Canadian. We have been dating for 7 years long-distance, I am legally not allowed to work, to go to school in Canada, and several other restrictions.


Here's what's difficult:


My boyfriend, but it's gotten exceptionally worse. Our house is trashed; there is trash sitting on the floor from a year ago because he's too afraid to pick it up (he worries excessively that it's contaminated). He has allergies that cause him to itch and burn, as if his skin is on fire, so he determines certain 'contaminations' and becomes deathly afraid to touch certain objects. I'm talking severe panic attacks - sweating, shaking, vomiting, etc. If I could post a picture of our house, but he won't allow me to touch the camera in case that's contaminated


It is quite trying, the countertop, a chair. The floor is the worst ... God forbid the floor gets touched. I have to wear certain pants bunched up several inches from the floor, or else he goes on a cleaning frenzy that lasts for hours with chemicals so strong that the skin on his hands peel. There is dust an inch thick on just about everything. Receipts and trash lying everywhere. Stains from 9 months ago that would have been easy to clean in the moment, but now need a paint-chipper to get off.
Here's another example: I bought a $2, but he ended up breaking it as the chemicals he used completely fried the hard-drive. Now it's sitting on a table next to a chair. That ENTIRE AREA cannot be touched - this is like a 6 x 6 ft area that is not allowed to be approached - not the table, not the chair, not the computer nor the battery, not even the t-shirt hanging over the back of the chair. This has been like this for the last year.
I am constantly washing/reassuring him/swearing that I haven't touched anything. I can't even do the dishes. The ONLY things I'm allowed to touch in the entire house are certain clothes that he has designated are clean, the bed, an e-reader, my chair, and my computer (he purchased one directly after he broke my aforementioned laptop). I can't clean. I can't dust. I can't even do the dishes. He won't, either, so we're sitting in a veritable mold trap. The landlord, is pissed because there is trash lying around outside the house (I can only imagine how he'd feel if he looked inside! We'd be evicted immediately). The mail has been in its box for a year (he won't touch mail at all


... which brings me to the next issue: the paranoia. He is CONVINCED that the government is after him. There are some things we can only speak in whispers in case someone is spying on him from the computer. We're not even allowed to talk in the car


What's even crazier, questioning, etc.


In the past (about 8 years ago), and for months thereafter, his mail would be torn to shreds. Cryptic messages would be scrawled across them. Someone hacked into both his e-mail and his websites, where they left threatening words. He has a daughter, and feared that they would harass her, as well, but they left her alone and only targeted him and his wife at the time. Even though it only occurred for about 9 months


He VEHEMENTLY REFUSES both medication and counseling, but he has a voice and a smile that can charm the birds from trees, so they believed him when he said that everything was fine and normal.


Before I moved here


I haven't touched a dog since I've been up here. I touched a pet rabbit once
His last partner cheated on him with a multitude of men, so I've cut everything off (I tried to re-kindle a few friendships - they don't want anything to do with me anymore, which I understand). I used to have to keep my phone on 24/7 for years when I was in the States so that he could hear every word from conversations I would have with others. If the phone cut off due to low battery, or if it disconnected from poor service, he would scream at me for hours, calling me a slut, a whore, etc, and would NEVER consider it. It's an act that I abhor, and it's only when I can grip the bed and bite a sock with tears streaming down my face with me begging him to hurry that we can do it!


I'm not even allowed to talk to the landlord. Whenever he see's the landlord approaching


I am not


Since I've been up here for the last half-year, quite literally, no friends to talk to (I'm not even allowed to try to make friends up here, as he feels that having friends are a bad influence and that I'm only trying to feed my ego and please people by having any friends). I'm not even discussing, 'Oh, I have 150 on my Facebook', I'm talking NO friends. NO outside contacts. Everyone that we meet, so most of the day is spent browsing reddit. We don't really go out, as he feels I'm going to use it as a way to meet people. When I asked if I could volunteer my dog training services to people in need (and because I really fucking miss it)


My chronic illness has become much worse up here. I can't tell if it's because of the situation, but it's such a harrowing process, and they don't deem my illness 'bad enough' yet.
Because I've spent 6 years following everything he's ordered - from cutting off all friends, quitting jobs, purchasing what he's required me to, what I'm allowed to read or watch, even changing my major, it's become a bit of a Stockholm Syndrome issue. I'm exceptionally reliant on him, and in the times when I did try leaving for a few weeks here and there (on several occasions), nightmares, alone


I can see that I am painting him as a terrible person. He pays for everything - the house rent, etc. He has spent thousands on clothes for me (I'm not used to Canadian winters) and has repaired my car on the several occasions it's broken down. At my sickest, he brings me home-cooked meals, laughs and jokes with me, caresses my aching body, brushes my hair, etc. He has never physically hit me (that would be a final straw - I watched my mother get beaten), and he claims he cannot live without me (he has a Will ready to go if I leave, I can see that he'd see it as losing one more thing and choose to end his life).


A typical day is me getting up before him, me pacing the hallway, getting food from the grocery store, preparing dinner at home, and me going to sleep while he stays up 'til 3. The next day repeats. I've begged him to change our habits for the last year, but he is unwilling due to his fears. I even asked if we could make some compromises so that we can both do what we want, but he creates such a fuss over it that I drop it.


I've become highly suicidal and resentful. I feel trapped if I stay and trapped if I go. I have tried antidepressants (several brands) to see if it was just MY issue, when I had tried to leave again, (he was screaming so loudly the neighbors phoned the police and they took him away), I got as far as 20 miles before I pulled out a knife and tried to end my life, I was panicking so badly. Of course, I slunk back to him, with his promises that everything was going to be all right


Every night I've been dreaming of suicide to escape this bleakness. I even had a breakdown so violent that I begged him for a hospital visit


**TL;DR**: My paranoid

I tried to give him a blow job last night and he politely declined. He said that it will take a little bit of time for him to let me love him. But he also acknowledged that if I don't try that he will just assume it's like all of the other times. I let him know that I will continue to love him and keep trying until he feels comfortable.
We have also began going to the gym together. He spots me and I do the same for him.

We are moving to a new apartment at the end of this month. 

I'm a [33F] We have been married for 8 years and together for 12 years.

He said he cares deeply about me and wants to make sure I am strong enough physically and mentally. 

The past: 
I don't show him how much I love him physically

I will be looking for a therapist or someone to talk to that is impartial and will help me work on some of my mental issues. 
i.e. not letting go of past hurts

We will living together in the same apartment for at least another year.

Some points:

* Yes

* Yes, this would have been a reasonable expectation. Many of our grad friends work and go to school). He then refused to get a job both times when the opportunities arose.

* I am currently in my new job (been here for a year) and love it. The move was mostly for him

* When he accepted the invitation from the program, stipends were only for two years and barely covered book/research expenses); and they claimed they would help him get a job anywhere with 99% success rate (this is complete rubbish altogether; profs just dump their students after graduation).

* I never meant to insinuate Arkansas wasn't a good place to live. It's probably very nice. I meant that I would not be able to find a job there as there are few jobs in that state relative to what I do. Right now

* I brought up living apart for next year if he could find a post-doc and he was generally accepting of it

I probably shouldn't blame him for the miscarriage. Yes, imagine your body hemorrhaging giant clots of baby, a baby that was a surprise, but you still wanted it. And try to hear the person who you love most in the world in the next room weeping and shouting, ""Praise god! I don't fucking have to deal with it!"" while you are huddled naked in the tub, crying as your uterus contracts, labouring the clot of cells that could have been a wanted kid out of your body. This is why I hold on to such resentment towards him regarding the m/c. No, when I needed him most,,

Like the title says, but he thinks of her everyday and misses her like crazy. Yep, he misses the girl that kept him friend zoned and wrapped around her finger.  That old country song ‘Jolene’ is echoing in my mind. Oh, and he works with her, not always side by side, but occasionally.

The message was sent around or on our six months anniversary. He made a big deal out of six months. I told him most people celebrate by the year
Yesterday morning while laying in bed I made the comment that nothing good lasts forever. Right before going to bed he tells me he thought I was breaking up with him when I said that. I asked him why he didn’t say anything, in retrospect. 

There has been one other time when I got on his laptop and looked through his history. He was upset with me, and yet he finds himself hung up on a girl that kept him away. I thought advice from this community would spare me from worsening the situation.  And maybe make me feel a bit better…

TL;DR  SO didn’t log out of FB account

UPDATE: I told him I looked at the message and told him I'd never do it again. He was calm and collected. After I told him he reread the message, even just as friends, he let her go and they said goodbye. She has not tried to contact him and he hasn't tried to contact her. He said he couldn't talk to me or many people about it, but the sister knew the situation and he wanted to get those feelings out to move on. She did ask him in the message if he wanted those thoughts to be relayed to her, he pointed out he did not respond and thought it was best to leave it be. He said he didn't think it was a big deal I read the message and when I asked if I broke his trust he said no. So it may be easy to read something like this and think the relationship is crap and not worth either of our time, but this is the first time I've ever felt like I've fucked up in a relationship. I freaked and thought this was the place. I've been put in my place several times with kind and not so kind words. I embrace it all and thank everyone who posted.",,,,

 ___________________________________________________

I (23/F) have lived with my boyfriend (26/M) for a year and have been together for four. We're pretty committed and have discussed marriage and both feel like its going to happen. 

When he started dating, when I say he was broke, he was **broke.** 

We currently live in his dad's house because we have been saving up for our own apartment for several months now. The living situation isn't ideal

About eight months ago, he's been an asshole. He will make fun of me for using coupons or opting to buy store brand groceries. If I have a bill of, let's say, $200, he'll laugh at me and say ""that's pocket change to me now."" I got fired a few months ago  and he likes to throw that in my face too. 

Recently, I just got a TEXT from him today saying he just bought a fucking Maserati ""because its his money and he felt like it."" Yes, a Maserati...parked in his dad's driveway... While we sleep in the basement... 

He didn't even talk about this with me first. After I told him I thought it was a stupid decision

Essentially, etc and I'm barely making it). I just want to be like... HELLO!!! I was there for you when you didn't have shit, and now you're going to get all ""big shot money bags"" on me? It makes me sick! 

How should I handle this situation? Do I have a right to be upset about the car? I've tried to tell him my feelings and he just calls me jealous. He was teased in school so I get the vibe he wants to be the ""cool guy"" with all this money and all these cars and potentially all these females... But I feel like his appreciation now is more money

I'm not sure if this is a temporary thing considering he's only been getting his money for a few months and its ""new"" to him

He also often mentions liking very thin petite girls but always made clear that he liked me tremendously anyway. 

Except last night

Now, but I also feel he should love me the way I am now, which isn't too fat as it is (I think?). The request also seems callous to me as I would still love him if he gained 30 lbs. Am I just wrong and it's an innocuous request I should grant?

Since she has broken so many promises in the past, and she said she was going to suggest the same solution, so everything seemed positive. 

I sent the rules. They were simple, not discussing any future plans (because she would say she'd do things just to get me off her back, not because she meant them) and also no giving of gifts (because she'd hold them against me to try to get favours/forgiveness out of me).

There were 6 rules, not emotional reactions. Those are my boundaries that she must respect. At first she responded with her rules, which were: 1.) be happy 2.) don't swear at me. I responded simply with a thank you. I was relieved that we could finally move forward.

Then, bitter email from her where she said that she is not a child, and that my requests from her are proof that I have issues, and that if my psychologist supports the list, or the idea of having rules for a relationship, then she questions his abilities as a psychologist. She said she was repulsed and she needs time away from me to deal with the resentment she now has for me.

As it stands my relationship with her is over, but never anyone else's. I feel like I should leave this alone now and focus on building my life, but it's very hard to once and for all accept that my mother is not worth putting energy into.

We've only ever really had one fight and it happened a few months ago. My older sister

While we were waiting for her, she came into the party to look for us. She found Matt first then grabbed me. We went home and I thought all was well. The next day, though, I overheard some acquaintances talk about the ""hot girl"" that picked Matt up from the party and how he'd made jokes about how slutty she was and how he was gonna ""hit that"" (those words look so weird in quotes lol). 

I got really pissed and I told him that his ""jokes"" weren't really jokes, it (reasonably, I think) makes me uncomfortable/angry to hear my friends talk about my sister. He said he was just drunk, didn't know the guys very well and felt awkward because I'd taken off (true), so he just made jokes he knew they'd think were funny. He apologized, though, so I let it go.

This brings us to Friday. Matt and I graduated high school last week and there was a big grad party at one of our friend's houses. Afterwards, most of my friends and I fell asleep. A little bit after that, I woke up when I heard someone go up the stairs. I noticed Matt and my friend Jake were the only ones gone but I figured they needed water or something so I went back to sleep.

On Saturday

When I asked Lucy what happened

So

But I feel like Matt knows how uncomfortable it makes me for people to act like my sister is a sexual object and then he pulls shit like this. He wasn't secretive about why he went into my sister's room - had he actually hooked up with Lucy

Jake thinks I'm overreacting because ""Matt just likes her and made a move

I dunno. Am I crazy for being annoyed? Should I just let this go? I saw him briefly yesterday when he visited my work (I'm a bus boy) and I felt weird around him and think he noticed.

Now, 2 cars paid in full, eReaders and we go out every now and then to do things.  However

For example

I got really upset and said ""We're not poor.  Just because we can't afford to get you a personal trainer doesn't mean we're poor.""  

She just looks at me really surprised and said ""we are poor."" 

 So

She says ""that's not what she meant.""

I said ""that may not be what you meant but that is how it makes me feel.""

She says ""Whatever"" and rolls her eyes and walks off.

Later I apologize for getting upset but stated that ""Even if that is how she meant it

She was taking the kid to get new shoes and says ""We'll talk about it later.""

We never talked about it later.  This isn't the first time she has said this and the first time I've gotten upset about it.  It really upsets me because

1) I grew up poorer than we are now.  Half the time how I would eat on the weekends was at a friend's house because we didn't have anything at home except for stuff for dinner.  We are no where near having to do stuff like. While I didn't grow up in the poorest of situations

2) I worked my ass off through college to get a good education to get a good job and help build up my finances so that my family and myself wouldn't be poor as long as I could help it.  So whenever she says we're poor it just seems like a knife to the heart on everything I've done to try and prevent that.

3) I think saying we're poor diminishes what actual poor people have to go through.  I think we should be thankful for what we have and she just doesn't seem to be.

When I mentioned going to the planetarium with some friends, etc.. She's added a bunch of new interests on Facebook and nearly all of them are activities/books/bands/etc. that I've either mentioned my appreciation for directly, or on social networking platforms where we're ""friends"". When we disagree on something, she's quick to backtrack and alter her stance so it's more in line with mine. When we started talking, she expressed zero interest in looking at grad school out of state. Last week she told me she's looking into two of the schools I've mentioned planning to apply to on the other side of the country. The location from one of them is so much the polar opposite of places and environments she said she was looking for that I can't imagine she ever considered the school prior to me talking about it (this is the thing that creeped me out the most). Today she texted me and I replied I was having a lazy day in bed watching football. She remarked she was doing the same and, though she's said in the past that she didn't understand or even like the sport, she magically acquired an understanding and deep appreciation for it. There's at least another dozen examples of behavior like this

For a while I was silently annoyed by this, I'm concerned that my reaction is on par with an angst-filled teen who gets upset that someone started liking his favorite band after he did. One of my favorite aspects of forming relationships with new people, platonic or otherwise, is discovering new knowledge and interests through them. I'm usually equally thrilled when friends get into books/music/hobbies/etc. that I introduced them to as I am when someone recommends things to me that I end up liking. At the same time, I've never had a situation where someone takes it beyond forming an appreciation for a few new things and winds up being into everything I like. I don't have Special Snowflake Syndrome and am aware millions of other people share my interests. Still it's odd when people begin referring to themselves as enthusiasts of, for example, genres of music, or copying a bunch of your ""likes"" off your Facebook profile. I've discussed the matter with our mutual friend who confirms she's never seemed to care about any of this stuff in the 2 years they've known each other.

I really want to call her out on it and tell her that it's unsettling and pushes me away from her. The problem is, she'll take it horribly. Although this bothers me, I think she's a great girl with a lot of positive traits. I'd like to continue being friends with her and definitely don't want to hurt her feelings, but I also think it's important for her to not neglect hobbies she had before we met, acquire more interests of her own, and overall be cool with being her own independent person.

For the past year or so, stupid, boring, and that I only ""fuck up everything for him"".

For some clarity, proven by his inability to attend a concert if he'll be going sober)

I've done the best I can as his wife, raise our two year old and 6 year old with very little help from him. I always listen to his venting about work, and I ask him to spend time with me on a daily basis. He usually is on his computer and responds to my advances with ""yeah, I'll be done in a second"" and then two hours later he's getting off the computer to either go to work or go to bed. 

He does something that frustrates me more than anything else though, and when I react with being upset or hurt, he absolutely loses his shit and goes off on me saying things to make me feel worthless and like I'm just a piece of shit. 

When he gets wasted

I've begun to adjust to his behavior by hiding my negative emotions from him because if I don't he'll get mad. I don't disagree with him anymore so he won't yell at me. When he does get mad at me anyway

I've known my friend for over 20 years.  Both his and my family are close enough that when speaking of each other at events, I can't say I've ever heard him complain about anything up until recently.

About 2 years ago they get married, especially since out of college, most of his other friends had moved on.  We never spoke about his wife or family and seldom about his daughter.  When we were together, it was like we were bros in a treehouse or playing our favorite 16-bit games for the first time.  We were and up until recently like little kids.

I began sensing increasing hostility from his wife though.  She had always had a certain brat-like personality and I suspect with her taking the role of a pre-school teacher and with her mothering her daughter

A few days ago, full of rage had ""had it"" with my presence in my friend's life.  Forget that she didn't want to have any part with me, she didn't want him to have any part with me.  She had demanded that he sever our relationship on her whim.  There was no apparent motive or justification.  My friend was conflicted by an undisclosed ultimatum she used on him and seemed to be trying to comply with both parties.  As a friend I didn't want him in any trouble.  What can I do really?    We talked for some time about it and how absurd she had been.  We didn't talk as if we were children.  He spoke and I listened.  Then he got the bill and told me that he would shoot me a text since he could delete those from his phone and that he would keep me in the loop.  We've had lunch 3 times since and nothing has changed.  He keeps taking the bill and we haven't talked about games since the incident.

My friend seems to believe that it bothers his wife to not be the center of attention.  I was never the center of attention when I was around

Is there anything I can do?  Is there anything I should do?  I'm so perplexed by the whole situation.  Imagine how she treats his other friends if she treats me

If it means anything, so there's no doubt that we could possibly be having that kind of relationship behind her back.  Also she hits her dog and has a problem when others pet him- feast on that.

First

After a bit (actually, and I had seen his dorm enough to know that he's a neat enough guy.  Non-smoker, rarely drinks, has a steady job.  I introduced him to my friend and they talked over lunch.  My friend likes him and said he'd be fine with living with him, so I went to talk to the land lord yesterday and brought the guy I knew from college with me.  I told him that I couldn't live there after all because of a family situation that came up, but that I already found a replacement and that my friend would still be living there.  The land lord didn't seem too bothered by this and sat down with the guy I knew from college to talk about things- setting down rules and such.  Afterwards, the land lord told me that this arrangement is fine and gave the guy paperwork to fill out.

As for my friend, but perhaps not hang out alone so frequently.  He agreed.

After maybe 2 hours of talking, he's not quite so open.  So he gave in.  He said that he's always found me attractive, but he never necessarily wanted to be more than friends until earlier this year.  There was a random night a few months ago where we had dinner with a mutual friend, and a guy that I didn't know very well came along too.  Apparently after I left, that guy asked if I was single and said that I'm pretty.  My friend said that this has happened before, but this was the first time that he minded.  Then over the last few weeks, he started ""getting a weird feeling"" when I'm around which isn't quite like having butterflies but ""more like a feeble lurch.""  His words.  Regardless, they're just there.  He had much stronger feelings for some other girl a couple of years ago.

**The issue:** On Saturday night we went to dinner and a movie, and rubbed her back for a bit, letting my hands wander closer and closer until I began massaging her breasts (this is how we usually initiate sex). She made some movements, which I thought were motions of pleasure, so I moved one of my hands down south and began rubbing. This is when she turned around and asked, ""Do you *always* want to have sex with me?"" I replied, ""Of course, but the point was that she was actually really tired and just wanted me to play with her hair and put her to sleep. I did just that

She was really upset with me the next morning. She kept telling me that I took advantage of her

I honestly had no idea that she was asleep or almost asleep (she had JUST been jacking me off!), and even though she now says that she forgives me, she's been acting very distant. I feel like in the back of her mind she really thinks that I was trying to creep on her while she was asleep/intoxicated. I would never ""take advantage"" of her, or anyone for that matter, and I am hurt and upset that she would actually question my character like that after 2 years of being with me and knowing that I'm demonstratively *not* a creep.

Okay so my sister and I are both in relationships that are over a year long, let me repeat that, an 18 year old and a 17 year old can't make out with their SO, ever.

Something my dad said the other day about sex and teens that really offended me was something along the lines of ""why don't guys just grab a pair of tits instead

My girlfriend and I have only been together for about 3 months. She said that a doctor told her she was unable to have children. 7 weeks into the relationship

**Background on me**: My last relationship was 5 years ago when I was in the Marines. I was extremely unhappy and entered cognitive-behavioral therapy. I ended that relationship and decided to work on my own life and to only enter into a relationship if I really felt strongly for a girl. I have a B.S. in Psychology and am working on a 2nd degree. I’ve only had two jobs since high school and have never been unemployed. I live in a house by myself. I think that I’m a pretty happy guy these days.

**Background on her**: She didn’t finish highschool and had a serious drug abuse problem for quite a while, but recently got a decent job. She doesn’t have a vehicle and lives with her brother and his gf. She describes herself as bipolar and has severe mood swings.

**Why I like her**: Despite all of this, and very funny. Being intelligent and having a good sense of humor are the two most important things to me, and her combination of those is unlike anyone else’s whom I’ve ever met. We both laugh at each other’s jokes genuinely and very hard.

**What I believe the problem is**: She is extremely insecure and jealous. As soon as we officially became a couple, I’m running to Taco Bell, you’re not dressed so you don’t want to go, do you?”  She suggested that an attractive girl works there and that I want to go flirt with her. She eventually told me that she didn’t want me going to Taco Bell anymore. She tells me that she doesn’t want me to look at any porn. She won’t watch a movie with me if it has a nude scene with a girl in it – if it does, she covers my eyes. I can never go out for a drink with my friends. She asked me how many girls I’d slept with – I told her between 70-80, despite only having two girlfriends in the past, each for less than a year. It made her very uncomfortable – she told me (despite me not wanting to know) that she had only been with 10 guys, despite her being pretty thin.

The accusations like this are CONSTANT. Daily. She is so convinced that I will cheat on her and there is a confirmation bias because of it. Everything that happens

I don’t try to fix her. I don’t tell her what her problems are. I don’t criticize her. I don’t try to “psychologize” her. The only real problem in the relationship is the unfounded cheating accusations. 

**My question**: Is there any hope for this relationship? I am not angry with her for all of this stuff. I see it as a fear of abandonment and severe trust issues. Despite her anger, I do not want to give up on this. When we were together, I told her I was happy about the baby, but I did suggest an abortion if we weren’t going to be together.

I just don’t know what to do. I feel like I have such good control over everything else in my life, and I probably deserve whatever bad happens to me. I’m not claiming to be right. I just want to make this work.

1351173128.0,122crv,My girlfriend (23f) and I (23m) are not seeing eye-to-eye on getting engaged due to student loan debt.,engagement23,151,47,217,"My girlfriend (23f) and I (23m) have been dating for about two and a half years now and our relationship has gotten pretty serious. 

We've been discussing engagement for the past few months. I brought up engagement first and it's something that I want very much. However

Here's some background: 

I graduated college in 2011 with about $60, I'm paying off my loans very aggressively. About 2/3rds of my take home pay goes towards paying off my loans each month. At my current rate, I should be debt-free in 2-3 years.

My girlfriend attended art school for two years and then was forced to drop out due to her co-signer bailing on her. In those two years, all of which is private. She took a hiatus from school for about two years and is now attending a public university with the goal of getting into the nursing program and become a nurse. During this time, she is accruing more educational debt, but at a much slower rate. She'll be 24 next year, so she's be able to file as independent on her FAFSA and receive much more financial aid. She also still lives with her parents and they are making her loan payments. She's doing well in school, but has effectively had to start over from square one. She will not be graduating until at least 2015 or 2016.

We've made plans to move in with each other once I've paid off enough of my loans that I can afford to pay the rent and other living expenses by myself and she'd be living with me rent-free. I want to do this because I want to give to her what my parents are giving to me

She and I want to get engaged, much sooner than it would take for us to be in a stable financial situation. She tells me that I'm too concerned about money and that if I feel this way that my love for her is conditional on her getting a good job. I don't feel that way at all.

1342736280.0,wuake,My GF is going to see the new Batman at 3am tonight with another guy... am I wrong here?,batmansadman,144,39,135,"So here is some background.

My gf is out of the city for a few months but I am going to visit her next week.  I told her how much I wanted to see batman with her because we both love the movie and thought it would be cool if we both waited to see it together.  She told me she wants to see it opening weekend and wants to see it with her sister.  Fine.

Few weeks later I find out another dude got tickets and they are seeing the show together at 3am.  Nobody else

I'm pretty upset but she thinks nothing is wrong here.  Am I the bad guy for not being cool about it?  She just has to wait a week to see it with me.  Instead she is going with another guy friend at 3am and watching it with him instead.

She thinks she is doing absolutely nothing wrong and I should be cool instead of upset... am I wrong?

Also don't bother writing about she is cheating

I am 26 she is 24.  We have be together over 3 years and lived together 1 year.

td;lr girlfriend is seeing batman tonight with another guy at 3am instead of waiting one week to see it with me next weekend.  She thinks there is no problem with this and I shouldn't be upset.


**EDIT:** THANKS.  We just talked again and I sorted it out. The mature/immature thing really stuck out for me. I just told her F it. If we can have a good time next weekend then that'll be fine.  She is going to set up some cool things to check out and that should be nice. I guess she wins these things most of the time but really its just a movie. It definitely spills into more serious things but for this I figure I should just let it go. Fuck it. Thanks reddit for all the good advice around here. Helped me get it all out!

When I told her this she almost cried because she said that's exactly what she wanted to hear. She does try a lot in other ways. Just different than what I expect. I guess that's how it goes.

He calls me early the next morning and tells me he woke up in this guys bed naked and doesn't remember anything. I immediately leave to go get him given that where he was is only an hour away. He seemed shaken up but from what I could tell was handling it much better than I had expected. I took the day off work and tried to surround with all the love and support I could- he didn't really want to talk about it

As the day continued he seemed alright

He feels extremely violated and I can tell that he is struggling trying to cope with this. He is very reserved

I don't know how to be there for him. I don't know how to make him feel like it wasn't his fault. I only know how to show him love and support and I just dont feel like it is enough. 

TL;DR- Bf was out of town staying with acquaintance of the friend he went with and was drugged and sexually assaulted buy the acquaintance. I could really use some advice on how to be there for him.

1376248338.0,1k5pgi,My (19f) best friend (20m) is trying to force me into ending my 3 year relationship with my boyfriend (20m) because he watches porn.,BlankCarrots,148,39,67,"Well, and we've always been close, although we have established boundaries with how close we get (hugging

The porn side, it bought up redtube in suggestions) Harry tried to play it off as a mistake, but I told him I didn't care if he watches porn, it didn't bother me as long as he didn't take it further than that. It's never been an issue whilst we've been together, until now.

By what I gather, but has never let it affect our relationship. But (Harry told me all of this) Rob had apparently been really grinding on him all night, saying that ""it's hard to get a relationship closer than us (me and him) and Harry was pissed. So he said ""so can I, and I get an awesome relationship too, so whatever."" 

This apparently has sparked some outrage, which I am not by any means. But will I be able to keep them both? Rob says that if I could be so stupid to stay in an ""unfaithful relationship"" then he can't fathom our friendship continuing. I don't want to lose such a good friend, but is it selfish of me to prioritize my relationship over a 10 year friendship?

tl;dr. My ""best friend"" has been a dick to my boyfriend

Edit: I'm going to phone Rob and tell him that what he's doing is crappy. Hopefully he'll get his shit together and realize that he's not being a good friend.

Update?: I phoned him,  and that he was hoping to hear from me. This was our conversation (ish)

Me: Look, but I thought you of all people would know our relationship is better than that. I've never had a problem with him watching porn, and that's the end of that. I'm not discussing it further. As for you wanting to end our friendship, if that is how you feel, then you do what you have to. At the end of the day, I love Harry, and I love you. The only difference is, friendship or otherwise, then you're not as good a friend as I thought you were.

He started shouting ""Is this what you think this is? I just didn't want you to be taken for a fucking mug, so you can get that idea out your head. I don't give a shit about your relationship, i'm just sick of that prick Harry thinking he can do whatever the fuck he wants. He's an arsehole, I don't see why you'd want to be with that bastard anyway""

Me (got pretty pissed at this point): ""Funny how you only tell me that now! I was trying to be nice, I never gave you any signals that we'd be any more than friends, so there's no reason for you to care if I was with an arsehole or not!"" 

Then I hung up. He tried to ring back

Edit 2: I can't believe how stupid i've been. I think I need to end my friendship with Rob

Update 2: I phoned Harry, saying he was so happy to hear me say that, and it was what he wanted all along but he didn't want me to resent him for doing exactly what Rob is doing right now. Lots of mushy crap ensued. 

I then texted Rob

""I'm sorry that a 10 year friendship had to end this way, and i'm sorry. But I choose my happiness over your petty jealousy, and a friendship that wasn't really a friendship. I hope you find what you're looking for."" He's tried to ring me a few times, but i've rejected them all so he knows i'm not prepared to hear what he has to say. I'll see Harry in the morning so we can have a proper chat. I'm crying, i'm shaking, and I feel sick. I can't believe I never realized how badly he treated me, and Harry for that matter.

---

Thanks for all the advice you guys gave me last time- there were some really good suggestions given


Summary of previous post: Last week, after stating that they are visiting, is: ""No approvals needed, no denials accepted"". 


I was really angry about the situation- I felt like they were overstepping their boundaries, and then I talked to him again. He actually was pretty receptive, and we had a good conversation. We both agreed that he would talk to his parents, and discuss appropriate boundaries. We wouldn't ask them to stay in a hotel (because they can't afford it), but would tell them that they will need to respect our need for privacy and alone time, should we ask.


What's happening now: He skyped with his parents on Saturday (alone because I was out of town). He said that it went well, letting them know that during the ten days they will be visiting 1) We will be away for one full day, as we had already made plans to celebrate our wedding anniversary 2) A friend of mine will likely be dropping in from out of town, and might be with us for a day or two and 3) I asked them to leave their handguns behind (This is a personal preference of mine- 6 months ago they both bought handguns for the first time, and have decided that they only feel safe when sleeping next to their guns- I do not feel comfortable with that in my house, so I asked that they leave the guns behind).  


I honestly wasn't trying to be antagonistic- I just wanted to be very clear with them upfront


I didn't receive any response from them Saturday or Sunday (unusual because they are always quick at answering). Then yesterday (Monday), and bought a flight ticket for my MIL's return home). When he asked why, they said that they would talk to both him and me over skype. Well, my husband has a super busy week, and doesn't have the time to have another lengthy discussion- and they had planned on driving down here June 30. So I told him I would talk with them and try to smooth things over before then, because at the end of the day, it would be nice for him to see them


So, and listen to what they had to say. I told them that I'd be back in the states today (Tuesday) and asked them to let me know a couple of times that might work to Skype. No answer- instead, my FIL texts my husband (as a response to my text?), and tells him that they will not answer any texts, and will only communicate via Skype. 


So I played dumb, so I think my last text probably didn't go through. [Husband] is busy all week- do you have time to skype with me today?"" A few hours later, I get a text from my MIL saying they will skype when my husband is able. I responded saying ""I just asked because between both of our schedules, we won't be able to skype with you until this weekend- and if you canceled your plans because of something I said, I want you to know that I'm available to talk before then"". No answer. I know that they've checked their phones, because they sent my husband a text after that saying they were thinking of him.


It's frustrating, he has nothing to say to them. 


So now it looks like they are no longer coming- and I do feel guilty for causing tension between my husband and his parents. Part of me wishes I just kept my mouth shut, while the other part feels like if I didn't say anything, they would have continued to overstep their boundaries and I would have gone crazy. 


So as of now, and I guess I'll stop asking them if they want to talk with me.

1369273076.0,1evjk4,I'm a male (18) and I've been friends with a female (18) for two years. I face one of the classic guy problems: should I go ahead and tell her how I feel or not?,cognitivelydeparted1,176,73,68,"   I'm a male (18) who's a senior in high school and there's this girl (18) I think I'm in love with and I've had some serious conflict in my head about this. I have no idea what to do and I need the collective wisdom of reddit users. So here's my story:
   In the fall of 2011 I met this girl though my friend and we found out we were taking several classes together that year. We had known each other for several years before that, but she had a little bit more trouble with it than I did. Don't get the wrong impression though - this girl is really smart, she got a 5 on the AP Calc. exam later that year - but she the concepts didn't come quite as fast for her as they did for me. So, I agreed to help her out at her house whenever she needed it. 
     At first
   It is worth stopping here and noting that she and I are very much the same personality, I basically told her I didn't want to be friends anymore because I didn't feel like she valued me. We weren't friends for about a month after that, but once again we were drawn back to each other. I left during May for a volunteer project and I returned in August. She told me that she really missed me over the summer and we became great friends again. Anyway, we once again had these periods where I thought for sure that we would be together and we also had these dark periods where we wouldn't talk. I'm a runner and I was injured for most of the winter of 2012-2013 when I finally came back she told me how much she missed me not running. 
   Finally, yet sometimes I think she just craves the attention. I don't want to regret not telling her, yet I don't want to feel the pain if she rejects me. BTW I don't tend to do this kind of stuff (partly because of a high school culture that emphasizes getting laid over emotional attachments), but I made an exception because she's so important to me and I think I love her. Any advice will be much appreciated!

Basically, because I was afraid he'd end up choosing the carefree single life (or what he imagined it would be) over me.


BUT. We ended in a good place. He explained that although he had these feelings of lust for other women - which a commenter on my previous thread pointed out, I ""always, always, always come first."" So we've ironed out what I'm not comfortable with, and he's promised to keep being open and honest with me about these things as well as to reign it in with the other girl.

http://redd.it/16bjd9


Well

We met in person, I started the conversation. I told her that I felt disrespected, lied to. I told her that she's welcome to do what she needs to do or think about what she needs to think about, but that I'm not waiting for her. I can't do that to her, but most importantly I can't do that to myself. I'm no one's back-up guy. I told she was either in or she was out. There is no in between. Then I let her speak.

She explained to me that the ""feeling"" she felt was not related to the guy who kissed her. In fact, someone who she really didn't necessarily have feelings for). Rather, someone kissing her (who wasn't me) made her realize that perhaps she wasn't ready for a long term relationship, or at least not as ready as she had previously thought. She told me ""You [me] love with your whole heart, and give 4000%,"" and that she doesn't think she's ready to do the same. She also said that I was ""too good for her.""

Apparently, there was no question. I had been an ""amazing boyfriend"" and had ""treated her better than anyone had ever treated her"" (her words). Common sense dictated that our level of compatibility (emotionally, sexually, etc) should lead to a relationship.  When feelings are involved, however, she can't reconcile the disparity between common sense and her emotions.

I told her again that I can't wait around for her to decide what she wants out of a relationship, this girl has a lot of personal issues to work out. I can respect that. She's young, and probably still has a lot of difficulty understanding her emotions. I'm happy she's one step closer to finding out what she wants out of life.

With regard to the relationship, realize that that's probably a really terrible idea, and acknowledge the fact that I'm just a horny 20-year-old guy. Damn... I can't believe I'm now considering this. Thoughts?

As for me, about other people, and about what it truly means to be in a long term relationship. Time to move on .

I walked away with my dignity intact, THANKS! You all made me see this situation from perspectives I likely would not have considered otherwise.

Peace.

My twin sister recently came back from studying/working abroad, rock climbing), so now that she's back we've been spending a fair amount of time together.  Anyway, my gf for some reason isn't okay with this.  I ALWAYS invite her to come, but she usually says no.  Which is fine, but then she'll act cold towards me and like I'm abandoning her.  

Additionally, gf has been kind of sullen and unwilling to engage with the conversation/activities.  And I don't think it's because she felt left out of our twin-ship (for lack of a better word) because the most prominent time was in a large group and usually she is very outgoing and usually totally fine hanging out in big groups.  

Whenever we hung out together, but she brushed it off and said she had just been feeling awkward and it was nbd.

However it's still happening

And last night was the most ""what the fuck"" moment so far -- I was looking at pictures on FB from my sister's trip to Dublin and gf asked if I thought my sister was prettier than her.

Ive been with my fiance for 3 years he 28 me 28 and got engaged last month (he asked me).  Ive always known he had issues about his ex but hes always reassured me that hes moved on.  

In the beginning she was all he talked about, he would say ""Wow Ex would never do that""  at first it made me feel good but then i started to get sick of hearing her name.  I asked him about her and he said that she had totally messed his head up when he found out that she had been cheating on him.  He had only just moved in with her when he found out she was sleeping with a mutual friend.
I told him that he needs to forgive her so that he can let it go and be happy with me. 

Problem is although ive been very supportive to him through this its been eating away at me.  As a woman he supposedly wants to marry should he really still have his ex in his head so much. I got suspicious and checked his p.c  He has pictures of this ex some taken when they were together and some profile pictures that were taken since they split up. The pictures were in a folder filled with porn stars pictures so its obvious to me this is his 'man time' file. 
She is very different to me
I think this is a really strange thing to do and im sure it means the end of our relationship. i havent spoken to him about this yet but i know he knows somethings up. 
my head is spinning with thoughts like
Does he wish i was her?
Does he think of her when hes with me?
would he go running back if she gets in touch?
why keep pictures of someone who hurt him?
will he ever get over her?
or is this normal?
I posted this question on an advice forum and got lots of responses saying to dump him and that he will cheat on me with her. But nearly all of them were women lol im hoping for some mens input 
SUMMARY:Me 28 him 28 FIANCE ISN'T OVER HIS EX. WHAT DO I DO?

**UPDATE** I spole to him a couple of times over the weekend (on the phone as im away) He admitted he used the pictures to masturbate to. He didnt think it was healthy and agrees its a problem
He couldnt really explain why he did this only that its a sexy memory. He doesnt bother with porn anymore becuase hes watched it too much and it doesnt feel real. I asked him where he got the pictures from and he said some she had sent him when they were together and others hed gotten off her facebook page while weve been together. I asked him why he would be on her page and he sys he was just curious. I think he isnt over her why would he care what shes up to now. This has happened on nights ive been out with friends or away with work

**Recap:** My dad[55] is in an emotionally abusive marriage with his wife [56] where we were both affected. I luckily am now for the most part on my[21] own minus finances but he has become a shell of who he used to be. My dad curses at me, tunes me out after a few seconds of talking, gets extremely overwhelmed by me if I want to spend time with him, he hangs up on me, and gives me the impression that what I say isn't important and that I am no longer a top priority in his life. He's overweight and unhappy and sleeps in separate bedrooms from his wife and uses work as a form as escapism. 

**The Good:**

I made my dad come to therapy with me and I voiced my concerns with our relationship. He is going to try to work on the cursing since the therapist says it is a form of emotional abuse and highly inappropriate to do to his daughter. He was embarrassed by it and will try to be more careful about it. He cursed after we left but not to me...but she wants him to stop completely. She also wants him to stop crossing boundaries

**The Bad:**

I discussed this in therapy last week but we covered so much we didn't discuss it this week. My dad had a past of finding an excuse to drink alcohol with his sleeping pills to get more drunk back when the marriage was at it's worst and he felt like he couldn't leave. It was scary and we banned alcohol from the house. Now

**TL;DR** Went to therapy with dad. He's going to try to curse less at me and respect boundaries and spend more time with me. He is abusing2 different types of pills he uses for ""sleeping"" but gets a weird high from it to cope with his life.

My boyfriend and I were at a friend's party a couple weekends ago. My friend (let's call her E) has known both of us for about 7 years now and is one of my best friends. 

A couple hours in, figuring I should just trust and they were with a group anyway.

I was pretty drunk a few hours in. I get emotional when I reach a certain level of drunk

The next part is a bit hazy

My boyfriend and I talked the next day. He said he was so sorry and felt guilty

We both really want to be together and we're working things out. 

My dilemma: I love my boyfriend with everything I've got, but I can't stop picturing him kissing her. I need your help, Reddit. How can I trust my boyfriend again? Or am I just stupid for trying?

1369932703.0,1fcghw,I (30M) work with a flirtatious/promiscuous young woman (22F) who I discovered a major secret about. Now I think she's trying to sabotage me at work. Should I ride this out or be proactive?,MindMyOwnB,124,20,102,"This gets a little complicated.

I work at a small business that has had an almost exclusive male employee roster for the two years I've been here. Our HR woman

From the very start she has been extremely unprofessional: flirtatious with every guy there, rumor has it, had to sit her down eventually and inform her that she was on probation after multiple warnings for being in the back warehouse too much (her sales position doesn't require going there very often) and for her choice of attire. 

Obviously this had nothing to do with me. I have a live-in girlfriend whom I love and so everytime she did her flirty thing with me I always just ignored her and stuck to my work. Eventually she gave up on me which was fine by me. Didn't want to anger the owner's daughter but there was no way I was flirting back with her.

A little while back I was on facebook at home one night when I saw that she had posted a status that read, which she doesn't, I think she was just mining for compliments. But, I figured, if she'd lost half of her 12lbs goal for her diet, well, I might as well say congratulations. Keep in mind the other people who had commented had said things like ""u go girl!"" and ""keep it up I know you can do it!"". I felt for sure this meant she was posting about the progress of her diet.

The next day at work for the first time in months she was super flirty with me again. As always I just smiled politely and kept working until she finally whispered ""Why did you ignore my chat message last night?"". I told her I hadn't seen it but would check it out when I got home.

The chat she had sent basically said: ""lol I didn't know you knew! Who told you? It's okay you don't have to answer that. Do you want to be next?""

Confused as hell I wrote back a short: ""No thanks I'm happy with my current routine but  thanks for the offer"". I was referring to my own exercise/diet routine of course. 

A while later she wrote back: ""Are you sure? I'm more than willing to and we can just do it once. I want to win this bet so bad lol""

Me: ""What bet?""

Her: ""You know

Well the confusion went on until she made it clear that the 6 down

For the next few days she was super flirty with me again. She left me little notes on my desk with things that said

Then she took a different route. She confronted me in a supply closet once and made her biggest move, etc. When I rejected her firmly she went into ultra bitch mode. She essentially threatened me, saying that if I didn't want her, fine, but the bet thing was a joke anyway and wasn't true and if I started spreading rumors about her like that she'd have me fired for sexual harassment. I promised her I wouldn't say anything.

Learned along time ago to just keep my head down and mind my own business so I did. But after another few days she began to be hostile to me in public

Lots of other little things she started to do really made me start dreading going to work

I made an honest mistake with a sales order that somehow she found out about. I corrected it right away and honestly

Now

I don't know what to do anymore. The only real evidence I have about her and this stupid bet/sexual harassment are the FB chat logs but I'm worried that's not official enough for any legal actionshould things get worse. I could try talking to the owner, not sure how to prove it. 

The final and worst part here is that if she was telling the truth, since most of them are married or have girlfriends, why would they back me up? They obviously wouldn't.

If I could do it over again I would have started reporting her flirtations early on so there would have been a record. I would have kept the little notes she left on my desk. I would have spoken to the HR woman immediately after finding out about this supposed bet/game she's playing. Have it all on record but I didn't. So now what?

So over the last few days, whose names had been mentioned, and they all had relatively similar answers. That they had said/heard something but that it was nowhere near as major as the way my friend expressed it to me. 

I spoke a lot to my other best-friend (lets call her N)

So, and the conversations I have had with my boyfriend, I have determined that he has not been unfaithful. However, the talk did not go as planned. She launched another attack on me, in the form of 'I just don't get why you're with him, he's a dick'. It was a tirade of her opinions of him and me, and she said lots of nasty things like she doesn't get how I put up with the abuse (he has never abused me). She also spoke a lot about how she is afraid of him, and then left. 

So now I am home, and now my boyfriend thinks I should ditch her as a friend. I didn't really think things could be worse but I dare say they are now.

Thanks again everybody!  Keep being excellent

...

We have been dating for about two years and over the past couple weeks she has become extremely worried about our future together.  She actually came out and told me that she is afraid of me dying before her and leaving her alone since I am older and women statistically to live longer than men.  I can certainly appreciate that concern but the reality is that none of us really know how long we're going to be here.  She told me that for that reason

She is Indian and I understand that, but what really upsets me is that she seems to want to have it both ways.  After dumping this in my lap she tells me in the next breath that she doesn't want to break up.  She sees no future for us but when I suggested that maybe it would be best if we both tried to move on, she turned everything around on me and said that I'm not fighting enough for her.  Wtf?

I am in the process of a major lifestyle change right now, as well as several backup plans in case things don't work out.  I have what I feel is a fairly solid business idea for something that, to my knowledge, has never really been done before.  I know it's going to be a lot of hard work and I am willing to accept the risks, but the whole thing does not compute in her mind and I honestly don't think I can count on her to be there if the chips are ever truly down.

About 9 months ago, and I sure as hell haven't done anything since. 

I love my boyfriend beyond words. He is the kindest, hilarious person I have ever met and the thought of losing him is worse than almost anything I could imagine. I currently do not deserve to have him as a partner. Because I was very confident that a) I would never cheat on him ever again, that it was a one-time drunken mistake, and b) He would absolutely leave me if he found out, I never told him. I tried to bury it and move on with our relationship as though that stupid, fucked up thing I did had never happened. (By the way, I had covered my trails so he would have only found out through a confession from me)

A TWIST! The guilt grew like an evil monster. I arrived at a point where every loving thing my boyfriend expressed to me was almost unbearable, and also he knew something was up, so I told him in a nutshell and asked if we could talk tonight. We are going to talk later (oh, we live together, if that makes a difference) but I have to wait for another few hours for him to get home from his friend's house. 

Finally (and thank you for reading this far, given the situation? I know waiting 9 fucking months to confess to something like this is extremely shitty, but I was stupid and thought that it could be left in the past. As I said, I love this person more than anything, and I ultimately decided he needed to know and choose for himself whether or not he wanted to continue the relationship.  I feel selfish in a way for telling him, because I am no longer hiding an ugly secret and it does feel somewhat better to get it out in the open. Was this the right thing to do? I feel lost, sad, and I deserve no less.

Thank you for taking the time to read this.

We have parties at our house frequently and he has started having the girlfriend come over after his wife goes home.  My husband and I have kept quiet about it up until now because we did not want to get involved.

Obviously using a throwaway for this. I'm a **25 year old male** and am in kind of a messy situation with a girl I've been seeing for the past few months. I've been married once - but the marriage ended after 3 months - and I've been single since 2010. Mostly casually dating and I haven't gotten serious about anyone in a long time. 

One of my close friends at work is Jon (38/m). He was hired about a year ago and we hit it off and have become very close friends at work and away from work. I've started to spend a lot of time with Jon and his wife and family. They have three kids. **Sara is their oldest and she is 18/f**. They have two younger sons that are elementary school aged. 

Sara and I have always been friendly and I liked her a lot. She is young so that is a consideration. We got close in the fall when Jon asked me to help her with some college application related things. Nothing happened then but we became friends and started to talk a lot away from Jon and his fam. 

In January I asked her to come with me to a show. We had a great time and kissed. We hung out casually some more for the rest of January and February. All of this was behind Jon's back and I didn't ask his permission or let him know I was hanging out with his kid. 

In March we got more serious. Agreed on being monogamous and boyfriend/girlfriend and we finally slept together. I feel a little sketchy saying this but we had to wait a while just for some legal issues. I doubt we would have got caught but better safe than sorry since Cali's age of consent is 18. Also was Sara's first time. Everything went well and we both started falling for one another hard. 

Our relationship is really, and are just very, very happy. I've met her close friends and she has met a couple of my close friends. 

Sara's parents knew she was seeing someone at this point but didn't know who. We have been going behind people's backs to hangout and we both are getting tired of it. 

We don't know how to come out to her parents. I'm afraid of what Jon is going to think and feel since he introduced me to his teenager daughter and now I'm dating her. I didn't plan this out and our deception for the past few months is making this a lot harder than it needs to be.

Wife and I have been married 17 years. (M)e 38 her 37.  We have two kids 9&amp;13. We moved to the city we currently live in over 10 years ago because of my job. I have a great job and make decent money, so we stay busy between practices and games on weekends. 

My problem: My wife is tired of living here. She wants to move, finding  problems with them and when they do not meet her expectations, the friendship gets rocky and eventually fails. She knows this is a problem and has tired to work on it in the past. So this leads, in my opinion, to part of her issues. She has no real friends, therefore no strong ties to anyone here. She thinks that moving to a location where people are “nice and friendly” will make things better. 

 I am very apprehensive about quitting my job and moving, you would sacrifice and move”**. I responded last night to this by saying that I felt like she was putting stipulations on my love for her. She is a wonderful person. She will go out of her way to help people or lend an ear. She is a great mother to our kids and a faithful wife to me. She is the most detailed person I know.  Maybe she is depressed. No friends, no hobbies, etc…

I've avoided talking to him for the last four days but feel like this is coming to a head. I'm lost and have no idea what to do.**

My head is such a jumbled mess right now so I'm going apologize ahead of time if any of this comes out fragmented and incoherent.

I met my boyfriend in January at a dance club. We bumped into each other in the lounge area and started chatting it up and spent most of the night with each other talking. He was so charming, and every other generic word that makes a human being great that I immediately fell for him. We exchanged numbers and set up a date a few days later. The date was perfect and we had two more before our first kiss.

We've never been intimate, thing really began to heat up between us and we would fool around a lot when we had time alone (always clothes on and not a lot of touching below the belt). I decided I wanted to be intimate.

About 2 week ago I sent him a text saying that I was ready to take our relationship to the next level. He never responded. I tried to contact him several times throughout the day and he never called me back. I was worried that he thought I was moving too fast and was freaking out that I'd lost him. He texts me two days later saying he's been really busy with work but he'd like to talk to me when I was free and we set a time to see each other that night.

He came over to my house and I went out and sat with him in the car. He then told me he wasn't born a boy (it was really long and drawn out and painful and I cant write it all out yet) and he had started his transformation into one when he was 24. He started to cry and told me he thought he was falling in love with me and that he didn't want to lose me and I started to cry then too.

And this is where it gets muddy. 

I feel like a terrible person and maybe I am but I told him that I was disgusted. My stomach hurt like I was going to throw up and I went in my house and have avoided him since. He has called and texted and even sent me a long email but I don't know how to respond to any of it so I don't. I feel bad that I said that to him because I really do like him but I think what I said was true and I am disgusted by the idea that I've been kissing a female and letting another female touch me (I'm trying to be careful with wording here to avoid accusations of transphobia. I'm trying to be as sensitive as I can). 

I can't go on avoiding him forever (he's now friends with a few of my friends) and I don't want to. I want to be with him but I don't know how to be knowing that he was born as something I am not hardwired to be attracted to. Reddit

I'm not sure what to do.

**Edit: I've gotten a lot of really great feedback and I'd like to thank everyone for offering opinions and suggestions. I've learned a lot in the past night alone and feel a bit better now. I only ask that you do not begrudge anyone of their opinion- everyone thinks differently, like some have suggested, I plan on doing a lot of soul searching before we have our conversation. Despite my strong feelings, I am not sure if I can be with a trans person but I am eager to learn more about him.**

1st Update: http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1bft0a/update_1_im_losing_my_wife_and_it_seems_my_life/

Hi Guys

So some of you requested an update

We had our first therapy session today, my wife is not.

I already knew this, or feel the pain. She holds it in. She studders over her words, or just looks EXTREMELY uncomfortable. It's weird to see her in that light, because it's very rare that I see her so fragile.

The therapist asked questions, those would be the first in her thought process. I sort of laughed a little inside to be honest, because I thought, ""You obviously don't know my wife. (Yet)"" It also felt good because it was a reminder to me that I am not crazy for the way I feel. It also felt painful because we didn't get anywhere productive besides letting her know whats going on. I kept looking at the clock and trying to fit as much stuff into our session as possible. (That's the business man in me)

My wife expressed her feelings. She said she regrets getting married

She said she likes to do things alone (with our dog)

The main theme I got out of the discussion was that she doesn't like responsibility or compromise in her life. Period. She loves me, ""I am very selfish."" Which is something she's expressed to me before.

She just sounded confused about her own feelings. 

We didn't even really talk about sex. Which is fine, we barely even cuddle anymore. 

The fun (sarcasm) part of the experience was when the therapist tried to send us off with ""homework"". She said she wanted us to do 1 non-sexual, just cuddle....That's when things got awkward. My first thought is that, ok, great-- I get what I want, the physical touch of my wife. I knew my wife's first thought was, ""You can't make me!"" (And as you know, what she doesn't want to do

She had us pick our thing. My wife picked back rub, so the therapist said, ""what about cuddling? Like, before bed on the sofa watching TV"" and my response was, ""Well, yeah-- that would be my first pick, but I don't know how she (my wife) feels about that."" That's when my wife said she felt awkward and uncomfortable with it. So the therapist took it all back and decided not to give us homework. 

I have to say that I thought that was funny because about 3 days ago

Anyway, and it's not getting us anywhere.

I'm starting to wonder if she'll ever compromise, or above her, or anything like that-- but I really think she has it good. I care about her a lot, and I am a very loyal, caring, providing husband. A part of me feels so screwed over. :-/

On another note, but it's possible.

Also, and I've cut my drinking down way more than half.

Backstory: Girlfriend cancelled date on Friday before Easter because she cheated on her diet. Thought she was acting weird, came back to Reddit, and then sat down with her on Tuesday night and actually talked.

She finally came out and told me what was wrong. On Saturday

Yeah. So that was a bit of shock to say the least

She was six weeks along. It was a medical abortion; she just had to take two pills. She took off work on Monday to help recover; on Sunday

She had decided not to tell me and has only told me now because she realizes she can't ""get away with it"". Her plan was to act like she was really secluded because of stress/her diet and then she was going to act like nothing ever happened. The only person she told was a friend of hers from high school who she isn't even that close with, because said friend had an abortion in HS. I told her I'd never hate her, and that I support any decisions she makes, etc, but she was just really upset. I held her and tried to talk to her, but I have no idea where her mind is at, so I didn't really know what to say, and that I wasn't mad she didn't tell me earlier. I'll be honest, I did ask that I come with her to a therapist appointment, not because I thought she was acting crazy or anything. She accepted that

If you want to chime in with advice, and I felt like I owed you all a response.

I really went back and forth on posting this update. Especially now that the first one didn't go through. It's like fate is telling me not to update. It's one thing to tell the internet your girlfriend is cheating on her diet, so I'd like to get a bit of this off my chest somewhere.

He and I have been on and off for the last four years now

For the last three years our relationship has been long distance because he goes to school four hours away from our home town

He's always been paranoid about the risk of pregnancy and always has made me take pregnancy tests almost every month that we're sexually active. But now, he says that he no longer wants to have sex because although he enjoys the physical aspect of it, he immediately regrets it afterwards and worries that I am somehow pregnant.

This makes me feel like I'm not an adequate lover, or try to find a way that he can enjoy sex with me, but now it's hard for me to feel comfortable with him seeing my body when I feel like it's the embodiment of his worst nightmares. I know I need to get past that if I want to get our relationship back on a physical path.

after 2 months of dating and talking, ""I love you""s ""Im just waiting on you to change""(she cheated, multiple times) ""Indatrashz is a down grade dontcha think?""(to which he agrees)  At one point he says hell leave me for her.

At this point I did not know they had a serious relationship at one point

FF to about 3 weeks ago. I see them texting again, he is resistent and condesending (even laughing) towards my feelings in the situation.  Oh but that wasn't enough.

Two weeks ago we go on a break. During the break he is a complete dick to me.  I still try to get back with him, you would be pissed that I gave him a shot again)

**So here is the update.**  Last night, I say he had no problem ""leading her on to burn her before"" he says it's alot easier to be mean to someone you have a stronger emotional connection with (DA FUCK?) than a stranger, which is what she is now.

Still I sit there

Then heres the kicker.   I was in a severely physically abusive relationship before I was with him.   It was two years long and seriously fucked with my head


I walked out, you still owe me at the least $75, and that's being nice.""   (it's actually about 150, we went to colorado and I ended up having to pay for everything because his PARENTs did not give him enough money.


I then deleted his number, and deactivated my facebook (only til monday, can't go with out it thats probably why I am here.)  

I met up with a girlfriend (lol its actually his bestfriends ex who I happened to become really good friends with) we joke about how the only thing those losers were good for is bringing us together.

To summarize my previous two posts, and if I asked

After those I made those posts, if it would make me feel better.  I told him it wasn't necessary, that I felt better because he was being so open, and we could just forget about it and move forward.  

Things seemed to be getting better from there on out - we moved in together over the summer and everything seemed to be happy and good.  I started seeing a therapist to work on some of the anxiety and insecurities I had been feeling, and I became more productive and engaged in my job and schoolwork than I had ever been before.  

Then we went to visit his family for Thanksgiving.  I found a pair of panties in his room that weren't mine.  I asked him about them, but I figured I was just being paranoid and tried to forget about it.  

Things started going downhill in the months after that.  He started withdrawing from me and refusing to communicate about the simplest things, when we had the discussion last fall).  

Turns out that he had been seeing his ex in a less than innocent manner.  The panties were hers.  Whenever he had been going back to visit his family without me, buying her expensive gifts, and sleeping with her.  He had been doing this for the entirety of our 2.5 year relationship.  

I broke up with him, but this has completely validated a ton of my anxieties and triggered a ton of my old insecurities, and I don't know how to put myself back together.  I feel like I'm falling back into my old, destructive ways of thinking.  I don't understand how he could just lie to my face like that, and I don't know how I'm ever going to be able to trust anyone else again.  I don't feel like I'll ever be good enough to have a healthy and loving relationship.  

I am still seeing my therapist, and I can't let on to him how much I'm hurting.  I go in to my sessions, and I sit there and tell him that everything's going just peachy in my life, that I'm feeling much better, that I'm not hurting at all, but inside, I feel like screaming.  I haven't told my therapist what exactly happened.  I've tried, and he just kind of assumed it was due to the communication issues we'd been having

So I was molested from age 10-12 by my best friend's grandfather. It was obviously a fucked up experience, and I now sit on a board of directors and do volunteer work for a sexual assault center. 

My husband obviously knows about my past. It's stuff I've dealt with and part of what made me who I am. He has always had an odd fascination with it

See, the stays in the psych ward, him screaming in the middle of the night ""help me"", so loud neighbors 3 houses down can hear, the hallucinations and ""demons"" he sees, how he laughs hysterically at me when I break down and cry. Tells me he's SHOCKED that I'm capable of feeling. He's not right.

I've tried to get him help. He's on medications, he's an alcoholic, the meds don't work. My family lives on the opposite side of the country. Every time I go home to visit them, he lands himself in the psych ward. I've started extending my trips out there. 

So, they serve no purpose and they don't add to the story. I said those details once in my life. In a deposition to the court when I was 13. I spoke about them once and really didn't want to utter the words ever again.

Well he wouldn't let up this time. He kept telling me how I didn't love him enough, these details that I'd left in my past, I had to recount, in excrutiating detail to him.

I felt sick to my stomach. I just have this icky feeling about all of this. This feeling like he will love me more if I am broken? That is so fucked up. I know it is

I'm just really conflicted about all of this and I don't know what to think. I don't even really know what happened and I could use some perspective.

My boyfriend and I have been together for four years. We come from two very different types of families. His is well to do and he has never wanted for anything, and we were dragged back to where I was born and that's where I ended up meeting my current boyfriend.

We knew each other about ten years before getting together. In that span of time, and the shitty economy has presented me with only shitty jobs where I don't get paid on time, have my employers break tons of labor laws, and I was just fired from a job (I was on probation) that gave me the hope I could pay off my student debt in just over a year.

I've lived on my own for almost eight years, and compared his 4000 dollar a year rent to mine (I pay around 10,000 a year). After hashing it out some more, he admitted his parents paid his rent.

Despite being incredibly good at saving money, and worry about your credit score. He thinks that I can pay off 6000 by the end of the year, that's not happening now that I just lost my full time job. 

In the past I have suggested finding a room mate, a room mate might just be as much in rent as I'm already paying - I live in a city of condos - I can't find anywhere cheaper to move, so I stay where I am. 

He refuses to move into an apartment together (he cites me as an example, r/relationships, I know moving in together should be about taking the next step, which we're both ready to do (but I guess much more me than him...).

I'm thirty years old and I suffer from endometriosis. I worry constantly that I'll be infertile anyway and worrying about paying off my student debt so we can get married and have kids is a moot point. 

Every time I've brought this up with him he just acts like I'll pay off my debt in the next two years and we'll finally be ready to have kids by then. He says pay off 10 grand and he'll pay off 6. 

I don't know how to bring this up with him and tell him I honestly feel like he's being unfair in asking me to pay off such a large amount of money (10 grand! 1 year's rent!) when I'm already struggling to make ends meet on my own. I was working two jobs at the time I was fired from the full time job. I want nothing more than to pay off my debt and get married.

How do I bring this up to him without sounding like a whiny bitch? I WANT to pay off my debt (and am totally ok for trying to pay off 5 grand a year!)

I don't think they noticed as they were too into each other, but at the same time I can't imagine they're totally ignorant of it. Here I am quite conflicted: objectively, they displayed the most obvious/over-the-top PDA of any couple I saw at the waterpark, and it's no wonder people were whispering. At the same time, much of that is due to the fact that they're gay.

So anyway, but its essence was that I find the PDA offensive not for the fact that it's PDA in front of family, but because it's PDA between a gay couple. I felt uncomfortable because they're challenging societal norms. I wouldn't have sent the e-mail if they were straight, because even if their PDA had annoyed me, actually addressing it would have been a breach of interpersonal boundaries, etc. etc. She made some good points, but she also completely refused to acknowledge the validity of some of the points that I made. I'm planning to reply eventually because this is an important conversation to have

Anyway I just wanted to give you all an update, but I think I'll have to figure that out for myself...though I may cross-post to r/LGBT as someone suggested last time.

My father knows about her social/mental difficulties and the problem is that he doesn't do anything to help her grow up: he just do everything she wants. In other words

My bigger problem with her is that she is constantly spying on me when I go talk with my dad.
It's insane: when she is watching TV and I am on the kitchen with my dad
As long as our conversation ends
This confuses me a lot

My father knows that she doesn't like when we are alone talking or just on the same room without her.
The result is that he is always distant and we NEVER got a normal father-daughter relationship.
He is always cold and distant
Unnecessary to say that this hurts me a lot.

This is just one of the many

I just want to clarify that as my mother
I wish I could help her out

Over the last 6 months she has struck up a friendship with a coworker who is a lesbian and is in a committed relationship. They started having a regular happy hour after work


Fast forward to last week, turn-ons, etc. Admittedly, to hear this from the bedroom I had to strain to listen, but I definitely caught enough of the louder snippets to get the gist of what was happening. My emotions ran the gauntlet from jealous to a little turned on. Anyway, their conversation ended and my wife came to bed. I initiated sex with and I noted she was already quite turned on.


Fast forward a couple nights later (last night) and we're having sex again. During a bit of foreplay and dirty-talk she asks me how I would feel about her having sex with another woman. We banter back and forth in the heat of the moment and I tell her I could be convinced and watching her with another woman could be a turn on. She then asks me what if it was just her by herself...at which point I saw something along the lines of I'm not sure.

In the morning as we're getting dressed, step of looking at her phone but she's changed her unlock pin. This is a woman who's had the same pin and passwords for years because she never can remember them.


My stomach has been in knots all day today because I feel like there is more going on. It bothers me immensely that she could be getting something from someone else that should come from her husband. I worry if I don't' let her do this she'll end up resenting me and divorce me at some point and break up our family (coming from a broken home


Am I being a pussy about this? Is it too late?


Edit: grammar 

Update: Wow, and admitted to very sexual texts. She professed her love and sorrow, and said she was confused because she's never had feelings like this for a woman. I tend to get very cold and clinical when facing emotional distress (coping mechanism I guess). She became very upset to the point of hysteria when I said I didn't know about our future. She then admitted that she came home from work early to ""talk"" with her about things and they ended up making out. She wears that's all that happened. I left the house after that. Not sure what to do next...she keeps texting me, begging me to talk.

I had become a bit jaded after my horrible marriage to a heroin addict in Los Angeles.  Since he seemed to respond honestly

For the first time in my life, and I am not an alcoholic...but probably drink more than I should.  He asked me out anyway. He was a little more vague, but interesting all the same.  He made me laugh.

Our first date was good but not earth shattering.  We had a lot in common.  Both married previously, from the same part of the country.  Just basically we mapped out well.  Sometimes that means nothing, but I did find myself unusually attracted however and found myself hoping he'd ask me out again.  And he did. 

By day 10 (not date!) I told him I thought I was falling in love with him.  He told me he didn't think he was falling in love with me.  He WAS in love with me.  In a previous conversation he told me he'd only told those words to four other people in his whole life.  I was scared and excited at the same time.

By November he had gone on a four day retreat with me

By December

In January

Our February cruise turned into our honeymoon. It was a fantastic trip filled with laughter, and intense professions of love.

It is now May.  Both of us are more in love than we ever thought possible.  We have both dated and slept with an substantial number of people.  We have both thought we were in love before...but nothing we encountered in the past comes close to what we seem to be experiencing now. We are completely committed to keeping no secrets from each other.  I have handed over all my diaries since I was sixteen.  He has given me every autobiographical writing he's ever attempted.  We both defy our entire concept of what we thought we wanted in a mate (ME: if you have no car, AND don't want to have sex with me I'm your girl!) (Him: If you cannot commit/don't want to commit OR are a stripper...I'm your man!).  I go to church most Sundays. He's an ex-Army paratrooper/Cowboy.

We still have plans for our August wedding.  Both our families think this is the best thing that has ever happened to either of us.

I met up with her and things felt initially awkward, but I'll keep an eye on that.

We went to the event and everything was fine, kissed. That kind of annoying couple everyone hates. We went back to her place and were falling asleep when she cuddled up and half-asleep asked ""Why do you bother with me?"", in the context I read that as ""I'm acting like a dick lately, why have you not left me?"". She quit smoking for around a month and at times she was a bitch and cranky, but she seemed surprised that I stayed with her through that. I don't know if she'd come to expect that, at the first sign of adversity people jumped ship.

As we were lying there she kept telling me she loved me and cuddled up periodically, it was like everything was back to normal, gave me a kiss, told me that she loved me very much and went off to work. Text on her lunch break to ask how my day had been which I appreciated.

Things didn't turn out as bad as I was expecting (yet)

1349376581.0,10y79p,I (27F) am considering divorcing my (39M) husband.,cantusemyname,130,32,227,"This is pretty difficult for me to write considering how torn I am on the issue. But it’s something I think about every day and for that reason alone, I’d be found out immediately and as of this moment

I have been with my husband for eight years. We’ve only been married for one, and we now currently live in the US. This is important, because I believe my homesickness is adding to our problems.

We have a few major issues in our marriage that don’t seem to be getting resolved. We fight. A lot. Once a week, someone leaves the house angry kind of fights. They are never about anything important. They are about little disagreements getting blown way out of proportion and then they turn into arguments about everything we EVER argue about, if that makes sense. If he asks me a question and doesn’t like the way I respond (meaning my tone of voice or my actual response) then it all goes downhill. It snowballs so quickly that I struggle to keep up. 

To give a better example, I repeated my answer in an exasperated tone. It was over then and there. That small incident, my irritated tone of voice, turned into a screaming fight that lasted hours. It turned into me being a bitch, me never talking to him with any respect, me talking to him like I don’t even like him. And I sit on the couch in a daze because I’m thinking “What the hell just happened?” And these arguments go on for so long that they turn into arguments about other things that I thought were long forgotten. 

My husband is a very defensive person, etc. If I ask him to clean the bathroom and he doesn’t, and I remind him the next day, he’ll say he must be a disgusting slob since I nag him so much. It feels like I cannot say anything to him without him thinking it’s a personal thing. The other day I was cleaning our kitchen, and I was getting frustrated with a stain that I couldn’t get out of something, and muttering under my breath about it. Nothing to him, nothing to anything, why can’t I get this out?” kind of thing. And he told me to stop

It’s exhausting. It’s gotten to the point where I just don’t say things if I don’t think he’ll like what I have to say. I keep things to myself because it’s just easier. I never know what’s going to set him off on a self deprecating rant. No matter how many times I say “I’m allowed to feel this way about something, it all comes out and it’s just a mess. In his world, I am not allowed to be annoyed with anything that a) isn’t his fault or b) isn’t something he can fix. I am not allowed to simply be in a bad mood. If I am, it’s because of him. And if it can’t do anything about it, then he calls himself all kinds of names, pouts a lot, and eventually leaves the house.  And it’s every time. He screams, he calls me a bitch on occasion

Our sex life is another issue. We rarely have sex. I don’t know why, so it just doesn’t happen. It’s not that we both don’t want it, because we do, we just never make the effort. And when we talk about it, we both admit that it’s a problem and we both want to resolve it but then nothing happens. He says I need to initiate to fix it, but I think that’s putting too much responsibility on my shoulders when it’s a problem for both of us. It’s like we’re both just sitting there, waiting for the other person to take control and do something about it and nobody does. 

He doesn’t even sleep in the same bed as me anymore. He says I go to bed too early, but then goes back to the couch. Kind of hard to initiate anything if “our” bedroom is only my bedroom and we don’t even sleep together. 

I also have trust issues. Without going into detail, found out that he has been talking to other women. I have found online dating profiles that he laughs off and tells me aren’t serious. I have found him sexting other women. He has accidentally sent me sexually suggestive messages that were clearly meant for someone else because they were in response to a regular conversation. He tells me he has never physically cheated on me, but he likes to flirt and thinks it’s harmless. I’ve told him that it’s not harmless because it hurts ME, and it hasn’t happened in months, but the times it has happened stick with me because I don’t believe his explanations. 

I haven’t seen my family in a year, because when it isn’t going well, I feel completely and utterly alone. Everyone I know and love is in another country and I can call them, but it isn’t the same.

Our arguments and the way we treat each other in general is making me want to leave. I can’t handle any more of his freak outs about nothing. I can’t handle his laziness. He’ll do a house chore if I specifically ask him to, then he gets mad at me for not letting him do it and treating him like he’s a slob. I just don’t even feel like we’re husband and wife at this point. I feel like we’re two friends who are kind of sick of each other and just living under the same roof. We have our routine. Get up, go to work, come home, watch tv, go to sleep in separate rooms. Wake up, repeat. 

I feel like this isn’t what a marriage should be. Not a freaking year into it. It’s like we’ve been married forever and have nothing left to say to each other. That’s not to say we don’t enjoy each other’s company, and I believe we both love each other very much. But I’m starting to believe that we were not meant to be married because our arguments never get resolved, and nobody does anything to fix anything. Things just fester and I think I’m starting to resent him for it.  Harmless things he does will annoy me simply because I’m not happy. But I don’t say anything, because I don’t feel like arguing anymore. 

I’m so torn because he is a good man. I love him, or if I didn’t love him, but he’s not and I do. 

I have no idea what to do. I’ve thought about counseling but considering his attitude towards anything that he does that might be criticized, if he isn’t told he’s perfect then he throws a fit. 

Any advice?  I’m sorry this is rambly

There are good days where I feel bad for even considering leaving, this isn’t going to work”… those days just go back and forth and I never do anything about it because I’m scared of making the wrong decision. I’m scared of what will happen if I do. I’m scared that I’ll leave and want to come back. I’m scared of crawling back home to Canada to the people I miss so much, admitting that I failed. Something needs to happen but I don’t know what anymore.

Me: “Why did you do it?”

Him: “Well

Me: “So I have to babysit you in order to make sure you don’t cheat on me?”

I told him that one of my friends is coming on vacation with me, how they wound up getting drunk and going back to her place, etc. 

So I caught up with him outside the museum and told him to look at the message and then look me in the eye to tell me if it was true or not. He couldn’t; he tried to walk away. I blocked him. He said he didn’t want to argue with me; I said he can’t argue because he doesn’t have a leg to stand on – he just has to stand there and take it from me. He said he wanted to go somewhere else and talk

I feel like an idiot believing that we had a future together, for giving me the courage to kick him to the curb. And what some of you have said is true: it’s not so much the cheating that hurts – it’s the fact that he lied and never planned on telling me.

She also later found out that he has genital herpes, which he didn't tell her.  She opted not to press charges although she had a very solid case (including rape kit), but has been in counselling and seems to be emotionally fine now.  Of course, she absolutely can't stand to be in the same room as the rapist.*

Even when he isn't coming over, I can hear his voice over the microphone on the game and it really grates on my nerves, but will now hang out with him whenever his roommate brings him over (whereas before he'd go into his room and not hang out with him).

I've tried talking to him about it, but her actions have said otherwise as she now almost never hangs out with my bf or his roommate.  My BF thinks that because she said it was OK it was actually OK, IMO she just wants to avoid drama and doesn't want to control who people hang out with.

I don't want to tell him he can't be friends with this guy, regardless of how long ago it happened.

My SO and I have been going through a rough patch lately. She moved 3 hours away for a job a few months ago and things have just gotten tensed between us. She came over yesterday for Valentines Day and

About two weeks back my friend gave me a picture she painted. She got new art supplies and it was the first thing she painted, but it meant a lot more to me than just that. I believe that was the first present I've ever been given (I grew up in a really poor family, so I never got birthday/Christmas presents, I didn't have a graduation party, and my SO has never bought me anything even though I've asked for something small like a card before), so I was really excited about it. 

I mentioned it, but she never said anything about it.

Back to yesterday, and once she does she apologized.

I knew that things were kind of rough between us and I wanted to show her I still cared and thought about her, and electric kettle) and I spent every dollar I had (literally) buying the ingredients at the grocery store.

I then spent almost two hours making it. When I was finally done and we sat done to eat. After taking like 3 bites she says it's gross and says something about how I don't care about her because I'm not taking her out on Valentines Day. I told her that I wanted to take her out but I just couldn't afford it.

Immediately after that she gets up and says that we're going to McDonalds. Whatever. When we get there

Things settled down again once we got home. I ate some of the meal I prepared then we just watched some movies and talked. I asked her if she could give me a couple bucks so I could buy groceries until I get paid (literally the only food I had in the house was the meal I made

Then we both woke up at like 4AM. She gets ready to leave

About two hours ago I realized that my painting was missing. The only thing that could have happened to it was my SO threw it away

He was cheating on me. I did not expect this at all and am in disbelief. One of our mutual friends (more of my friend) informed me that he had been going out with a girl for the past 3 days. She saw him messaging her through his laptop and told me a gist of what their conversation was about. It was basically them pouring their heart out for each other, etc.


I confronted him over FB chat immediately, and apologized, felt bad, etc etc. The thing is, he doesn't regret it. He was honest with me and said that he use to like her when he was young, and didn't realize how strongly he felt about her until he met her up in Asia (She lives there and they met when they were in grade school. She came to visit U.S. once or twice and they hung out before we were together). He said it just ""happened"" (bullshit). He cheated on me 3 days ago and told me that he has been wanting to tell me but didn't know how to. I didn't even let him explain what they exactly did together because it was already enough. I couldn't bare to hear it.


He even had the nerve to Skype me 2 days ago and have a normal conversation (Although I can tell he was a little off) Also


I just feel so hurt. I'm in disbelief. I seriously thought he was the perfect boyfriend. We had a healthy relationship... I trusted him with my whole heart. I could trust him to go club with his friends, because I thought that he loved me so much and would never do anything to hurt me or disrespect our relationship in any way. Even the way he looked at me... I thought he was in love with me.


I've dated many guys in the past and I can safely say that he was (is, or do anything... And it hurts more knowing that him hooking up with her (and having feelings for her) on this vacation is worth more than 1.5 years of our relationship...


I hope that this does not scar me in the long-run.. I am already feeling so insecure but I am trying to be strong.


I just wanted to update you guys on the outcome of this whole situation. I'm also thankful for everyone who took the time to read my posts and post replies. I appreciate it.

Throughout those two months I have been avoided like the plague and sometimes shot resentful glares from everyone except my own father. The members of this house are Me, step mother daughter # 1 13, despite us all being part of a family and them having been married for 3 or 4 years. 

About 3 weeks ago
her reasoning behind this is that it disrespects her that I do these things. I had no knowledge of anything I had done wrong before this besides the obvious hints. I fixed them regardless immediately.

2 weeks ago she confronts before I head off to school claiming that she ""knows I'm a devil worshipper"" and ""has found everything that I hide in the house that does not belong"". The purpose of these items is to ""pray tot he devil that my step mom and my dad break up."" These items don't exist. I go to church more than her. I don't care that they are married, along with apologizing. Whenever I left she was still up in arms against and not willing to make amends. I said nothing of offense during said conversation in fear that it will prevent future positive relationships, however she did not show the same reserve of the tongue. 

From there it only gets worse as time progresses.

Throughout the past 2 weeks I have encountered several things she has done that makes me uncomfortable:

* Multiple times a day

* Step mom has placed multiple crosses hanging on the wall directly in front of the exit to my room.

* Step mom often checks my room for absolutely no reason during the day

* Step mom stole my pillow

* Whenever I am downstairs step mother also likes to loudly converse with her mother that she checks everywhere in the house for demon items because it is ""HER"" house and she has that right. (In reality

* Today upon arriving home I noticed the remains of a spoon that was bent 3 times and broken that was placed directly in front of my computer. This spoon is significant because it was a ""devil worshipping"" item of mine.

* Step mom has called me a fatass a few times because I have eaten all of a substance. I didn't mean to because I didn't know it was something other than a luxury food that I was in the mood for. To give this some perspective I am 6'2"" and about 165 lbs. In the past two weeks I have only eaten 7 meals at this house. 


I don't understand what I'm doing wrong. I don't know how to approach this problem because it is so unusual. I have been extremely tolerant and patient showing no signs of hatred or irritation/anger this entire time that I have been harassed. I am a nice person, I watch my sister's kid often, and I clean up after myself very well. I cannot think of anything that caused this to happen.

I'm also noticing that this may be one of the most unfortunate user names in reddit history.

Background: I'm 28

We figured out pretty early on that we wanted a more effective form of birth control than condoms or the pill, until two weeks ago when she got a wave of nausea that wouldn't go away.

Last week, there's still an increased risk of miscarriage, premature birth and other complications for her.  We talked about things and we decided to abort, with an appointment scheduled for next week.

She's worried that if she goes through with it that I'd look at her as a murderer and that I'd think less of her and resent her afterwards.  I assured her that wouldn't be the case and that anything that happens would be because of *our* decision

She's also worried about denying the baby a chance to become something.  She looked at an adoption website and we both broke down seeing the stories of so many couples.  It just seems so fucking unfair that there are so many people who want nothing more than a child to call their own and here we are - who do everything possible to *avoid* having a baby - and we're stuck with one.  What's worse, I'm picking my GF 11 times out of 10.  Every time those worries come up, we discuss different options, but we've kept coming back to abortion being the best one.

I'm worried about a couple different things.  First, she's already cut a couple days ago and I fear that if she does go through with the abortion, she'll think that she needs to punish herself and cut more.

Second, ""hey, how ya been?  Oh yeah, I'm aborting a child, let's talk.""  I'm not close enough to anyone at work to talk about something like this.  I don't want to put this on my sister because she just went through a miscarriage herself.  And my mom... I love her to death, but she's wanted grandkids for a while.  Even though I *know* she'd support me in any decision I make, I know that at least a part of her would be disappointed.

We're both at the point where we're hoping for a miscarriage because it means all of this would be out of our hands. (She said it, reddit.  Just tell me something.  Anything.  Help.

**tl;dr:**  So I recently left the country for about a month and upon my return found out my GF has been hanging out a lot with a guy we both know from work. Am I overreacting? Is it bad that I thing a girl in a relationship shouldn't be going on ""nights out"" one on one with single guy?

**Before I left** - We are in an awesome relationship, he was flirting really heavily with the GF and  after a conversation with her I told her that I think that it's not cool that hes so obviously flirting with her. So she knows I don't like him. Now, due to the nature of our job we are not allowed to disclose the fact that we are dating so this guy didn't know for a while. Recently the GF told me she did tell him that we were in fact dating. (I can explain why I think this actually may be a lie)

When I left on my trip, I don't own my GF and I trust her completely so I say of course it's okay for her to go.... Now fast forward to me coming home from my trip; I find out a few interesting things. I find out that over my absence they have been hanging out a LOT [4-5 times a week] and what upsets me is the fact that she didn't tell me. Now my girlfriend claims they just hang out as friends, but, the type of things he asks her to do are really iffy and uncomfortably close to dates: They go get coffee, dinner, go to movies and cupcake tastings (don't even ask??). 




    
    **TODAY:** Call from GF ""I know you wont like what I'm about to ask you.... but [DUDE] wants to go to a movie is that okay?""
    
    Me: ""Are you inviting me with you guys or asking if you can go""
    
    Her: ""Oh... [pause] yeah I guess you can come.""
    
    Me: ""hold up a minute let me ask my parents if I can grab the car""
    
    We talk about something unrelated and the conversation ends.
    
    Several minutes later I get a text : ""So are you going to go?""
    
    ""Yep! Got the car :)""
    
    ""Oh never mind
    




This conversation is messing with me a little

Everything was going really well with our relationship until about a month ago. He asked me to move in with him (very soon in my opinion) and everything changed.

The first weekend that I had begun to move things in, they were both up playing video games from dusk until dawn, yelling through their headphones and so forth.

Don't get me wrong, it is actually something that my boyfriend and I bonded over, because I LOVE to just watch him play. That said, the same isn't exactly true for games like LOL, and while I normally wouldn't mind an evening of video games, I can't really participate with them from behind the scenes, and where things really came to a head was when I had to get up at 6AM for work, and they had been up until about 5AM playing the game and keeping me up. This compounded by the fact that it was the fifth day in a row

The same day - while at the bf's soccer game with my sister and grandmother in tow, and my grandmother, and believe me when I say that this is very 'par for the course' for this best friend and the crass way that he speaks to me. He is constantly telling me to shut up, and degrading me at every turn. He then proceeded to yell to all of his friends ""party at (my boyfriend)'s house! invite your friends!"" right in front of me, knowing that I was clearly not up for night number six of drunken screaming until 5AM with work the next day.

When I sat down and talked to the bf about all of this, he has completely checked out of the relationship ever since. He doesn't invite me to do anything with his friends or family, and most recently when I surprised him with tickets to see Avengers together opening night at midnight like we had planned for weeks, he informed me that he was going with his friends and that essentially I wasn't really welcome to come.

We're staying with my grandma and while our daughter took it very hard when we told her, but it will be on safe terms that he sees her.

These points made me think a little past my own concern and I became increasingly concerned with her well-being and the well being of our child.

If she posts it at 3:00 am I may not see it for hours or days, by then, it was old news to her. So, perhaps she would seek the next easiest, but we've communicated more in the last 12 hours then in the last few weeks. She has discussed things with a friend, and disappointments.

I will let her come get some stuff then tell her it's insulting to me to give me such a ridiculous ultimatum. I don't imagine it will go very well. I can cover my place until the lease is up and I am taking our cat as payment for not letting her credit score go down in flames. I'm not gonna do this any sooner cause she doesn't reply to my texts all the time. Thanks for the advise,,False,,t5_2qjvn,1357189297.0,,True

Well /r/relationships..I did it

We were watching Game of Thrones as is our custom for Friday night, I don't know what came over me but I sat up a bit (hes taller) and leaned in to kiss him..I only went about  80% of the way and rather slowly to give him time to react if he didn't want to, but he leaned in and kissed me, soft and gentle for the first one then we erupted into a full blown make out session.

I'm rather disappointed but also very proud that he stopped and sort of backed away from me in disbelief, he pushed me away gently and said that he wanted me to, but it was too complicated right now and that we should wait until he talks to my family about it.

It sort of turned into an argument (im sorry

I don't really know what to do now..I feel like I have him

Should I talk to them with him there? Or by myself..I did joke with my brother after my last update about how it would be great if his friend got to be his brother..but he thought I was talking about my sister and started laughing..I chickened out of telling him I meant me.

I'll have to give a bit of back story to explain the situation- 
I grew up with family 'X' and family 'Y', the mother of this family passed away while the kids were quite young. 

My parents divorced when I was 15, he was quite mentally unstable and she couldn't handle it. A couple of years later the father of family 'Y' and the mother of family 'X' got together, that was a little strange at the time. Earlier this year they became engaged. Several months ago the father of family 'X' committed suicide, this was absolutely devastating to everyone, we were there as the second family and went to the private burial and have spend a lot of time in contact. 

The wedding date is still set for mid January, happy to help out. Then nothing was said for a while about it. It's only been this week that it's been bought up again ask mother 'X' wants me to cater for the wedding instead. I notice that mum's already got her invite to the wedding for her, her boyfriend and their son. I've not gotten one and have no details. I ask mum about it and she talks to mother 'X', me and my sister are not invited. From what I understand the reasoning is that- the wedding is just for close friends and family, her fiance doesn't want the deceased husband to be a part of it therefor none of my siblings or father are invited either. 

I'm struggling to wrap my head around this; I thought I was a part of the family or that I was more so than mums boyfriend and my half brother. I don't really understand why I would stir up any emotions of the deceased husband or why they'd ask me to be catering if that were the case. I feel really uncomfortable that I'd be serving food like a stranger and not actually be a part of the celebrations. 

My sister is still helping out which makes me feel like I'm being immature about this, should I still be going?

TL;DR- family friends are getting married, not sure if I should go through with helping, or cancel and celebrate my birthday instead",,False,,t5_2qjvn,,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/15a2mv/i_20f_am_was_not_invited_to_a_close_family/

A few years ago, let's call him Max (18 at the time), and we would hang out with two other friends I made at the same time. A few months later, he started dating his girlfriend, let's call her Jen, who was in the same class.
They became very exclusive of everyone else, so we stopped talking although we were in the same class. They stayed together for the two years of the program, and then were admitted to different schools, in two different cities.
A few weeks ago


A few days later I saw her in the subway with another guy (we live in the same city). They seemed fery flirty


Now I really don't know what to do. Usually I would keep my mouth shut because this is none of my business, it's bugging me to see that he keeps buying her explensive clothes, taking her to restaurants, trips... for nothing. It's not like she cheated on him once, she is literally dating another guy at the same time.

I would say that 70% of my friends are girls, but later Jane said that my face ""lit up"" when I saw her and that I was obviously attracted to her. I denied being attracted to the friend (I am not) and tried to change the subject because this conversation has never ended well. 


She started a line of questioning.

Jane: In a hypothetical universe where you had never met me

Me: No.

Jane: But you obviously think she's pretty.

Me: Why does this matter? There are lots of pretty people in the world.

Jane: So you do think she's pretty.

Me: Do you think she's pretty?

Jane: Yes.

Me: Fine

Jane: So you're attracted to her.

Me: No

Jane: Obviously you'd date her

etc...



I've never cheated on her nor would I. At the moment I don't see how these hypothetical scenarios could ever be good for a relationship. At the same time


I have told her how I feel about this.


tl;dr: Girlfriend isn't comfortable with me being friends with attractive people. I am friendly but trustworthy and the questioning and suspicion is wearing on my patience.



**edit:** Thank you all for your comments. I'm going to have a heart to heart with her about this and how important it is. She has already acknowledged that it is a problem and she's promised to work on it. I'm not ready to give up on this girl. She's not crazy, kind, thoughtful, smart, beautiful, and sincere.

1332755768.0,re01t,Is BF's female friend damaging our relationship?,MissDiagnosis,124,23,183,"Bf of 3 years &amp; I (both 29) have had an ongoing (3 year) disagreement over whether his female friend (who lives in another state) &amp; he have an inappropriate relationship.  The first year they were chatting online throughout the day, leaving me &amp; her husband sitting there awkwardly chatting &amp; wondering where they went off to.. supposedly they were picking out music.  Her husband left her shortly after that (because of my bf &amp; her 5 other physical affairs with married men).  She &amp; my bf have still been chatting online for 2 years.  Last year I got upset (raging mad really) when he was commenting on her FB pics a lot again, he told her he was going to cool off the chatting for a while

I then recently find out that my bf &amp; her had an emotional online affair during her marriage (just weeks before we were dating)

We have had a turbulent relationship &amp; I recently went to talk to him when things were going well between us, I asked him to go to counseling with me then to learn how to deal with her being in my life (which he refused).  I see her as actively sabotaging our relationship &amp; not respecting our boundaries.

He's told her that he would never let me come between them, but I went to a therapist &amp; they told me that he's putting her 1st, and that their relationship is in fact inappropriate &amp; damaging to us.  Thoughts?

*An additional piece is that his ex-girlfriend before me forbade him to talk to this chick as well

UPDATE: I GotTFO 6 weeks ago.  I stuck around for a few more weeks fantasizing that he would tell me he wanted me to stay &amp; work it out, &amp; bashed me to HER TOO, lying to her that he wasn't 'allowed' to talk to her because of me (when in fact we mutually agreed she was being a bitch &amp; couldn't handle his new relationship yet).  At least it's good to know I'm not the only one he lies to.  =/  

Anyway, &amp; says I didn't want to be with him, or love him enough to stay.  It kills me that he actually believes this instead of seeing how long I *did* stay &amp; plead for him to work it out with me.  

I'm just trying to keep my head up &amp; readjust my life (different state, living situation, dreams).  I've never been more in love with anyone in my life, &amp; really wanted him by my side.  Some days I just don't see the point in being happy if I'm not sharing it with him, but maybe I can eventually snap out of it, or perhaps this dull ache will stick with me.  I feel like an idiot for being so emotionally invested in someone I thought would fight for me &amp; declare his love for me from rooftops.

Please help me.",porninduceded,28, these types of things do not happen very often in our relationship, and we both feel like we are someday going to marry each other. Our relationship works very well most of the time. But...

She is very, even constructive criticism, which is honestly the only kind of criticism I would ever offer her. The other day, she came home from work in a huff, sat down next to me and told me ""you won't believe what happened at work."" I was prepared to listen to a story about how her supervisors had wronged her, how bad they made her feel, how shitty her job is, she was extremely upset because one of her opponents on Draw Something never correctly guessed any of her drawings. She read aloud a long rant she posted on Tumblr about how she can't believe he couldn't guess any of her drawings.

I immediately let my gut reaction spill

I guess that was a mistake, if all I do is overreact to everything."" She then started to delete her Tumblr app, which I told her not to do. She continued to pout for a while after, and I felt like a huge asshole. I also couldn't help feeling, however, like these were tactics a little kid would resort to. A complete dismissal of any modicum of criticism resulting in what was essentially, a tantrum.

I have an anxiety problem. I'm on meds for it. These kinds of things probably wouldn't ruffle the feathers of most, I can't bring up this problem to her, because she does not accept that perhaps she has a problem with getting defensive over little things, a trait which has come up on her employee reviews--which of course, she dismisses in an irate huff when she gets home to tell me about it. 

How do you give someone constructive advice

TL;DR - My girlfriend has an extremely thin skin and cannot accept even constructive criticism

**EDIT**: I greatly appreciate all of the advice, and downright dumping her. I think I'll try them...in that order. I don't want to leave her, at least, not if we can connect about this and I can stress how much this is hurting our relationship.

I have to start by saying this place has been enormousness help so far.  I've been avoiding doing this for some time because I feel a bit silly and would be embarrassed if anyone I knew found this.  But I'm at a point that I don't know what else to do.  


**The Incident**


We both went out to her companies Christmas party and I ended up leaving early because I had to work the next morning.  Around 2:30AM, making out, with her bra lying next to her and both of their pants undone.  I flip on the light and yell the typical “what the fuck are you guys doing?” to her snapping back at me “What the fuck are you doing here!?”  “I live here! Who the fuck is HE!”.  I didn’t recognize the guy and asked if this was a coworker, and he responds with no, we met at the bar.  I told him to get the fuck out of our house and then I went back into the bedroom to put some god damn pants on.  I then came back out to them hugging/kissing in our back door way and them looking at each other like her father just busted her for sneaking her bf into the house.


He finally leaves and this is when I realized just how drunk she is.  She can barely stand up and has no memory of what happened 5 minutes later when I’m trying to get some answers.  She kept repeating that she didn’t do anything wrong and she doesn’t understand why I’m so mad.  


The next day


**The Aftermath**


Long story short, although I can’t keep from replaying this night in my head over and over again.


I learned that she had been feeling trapped, she’s not completely surprised it happened.  But she immediately said she is over those feelings and that and just wants to be with me.  She is upset with herself and says she never wants to make me feel this way again.


I’m upset with her, but seriously what kind of scumbag goes into another man’s home under these circumstances?  His response to her the next day was “Sorry I didn’t know you lived with your boyfriend” – yeah well, that doesn’t change much about the situation.  I feel like I can trust her to a point, but I can’t trust *these fucking guys*.  I admittedly wasn’t giving her my full attention lately, and this guy happened to give her what she needed for a few hours.  I can completely understand how this could happen.


I want to stay together.  I love this girl more than anything and I know I’m willing to forgive.  I can’t say that I’ve never been in the same place as she was


**The Questions**


I’m just worried that we haven’t really expressed our sadness and anger completely. I’m worried that she’s being so nice because


I asked her if after she gets off work tonight we can sit down and talk seriously about things


*TL;DR* – Walked in on my drunk girlfriend en-route to fucking some other guy.  She doesn’t remember any of it.  She’s sorry and I believe her.  I’m willing to forgive

edit:  Wow, but I appreciate it. I know maybe I'm being more forgiving than I should be given everything, but can we take it easy on the comments?  Maybe I'm delusional, but I'm not an idiot.  I know how disrespectful it was, I have to deal with it on a daily basis.  You've helped reinforce my feelings that I shouldn't take ""I was blacked out"" as a response.  And if that's all she has, it's not good enough. Even if she remembers it or not, she asked a cab driver to drop her off at our house, unlocked our door and then immediately went in to check on me with this guy right behind her.  *shudder*",t5_2qjvn,True
