1349795606.0,1175nc,The Mysterious Case of Rorikstead [Conjecture-heavy],,304,41,72,"This spawned out of a thread over in /r/skyrim about some odd things /u/rohanivey noticed in Rorikstead.

The OP:

""Okay, the songs, etc.

My proposal: Rorikstead is really the greatest secret cult in the game

Here's what I've found so far:

* In all the main houses there are soul gems. Really odd for farmers.

* Rorikstead used to be a shithole where you couldn't grow dirt. This has since changed drastically to Rorikstead having the best dirt in Skyrim

* The old codger responsible for meeting and greeting people is wizard as fuck. If you hang out in the Mayor's house during dinner you can see Gramps talking with the mayor's daughter talking about learning new magic. He beckons her to keep quiet about the entire issue.

* The old bastard also has some hardcore Daedra worship books on him and in the mayor's house (Where he lives)

The conclusion I've come to is that this is the real Rorikstead, and there's nary a quest to be seen at all in that town.""

.

Now

My comment: 

""There's also the dead guy getting chewed on by Skeevers a short walk from town.

I think you might be onto something. I'm going to dig around TIL and see what I can find. Be back later.

Okay, there's the two Song books that have *Ragnar the Red*, mentioning Rorikstead as ""ole Rorikstead"".

Anyway, I think. That's literally the only thing interesting on Rorikstead, including the forum thread for Skyrim in general.

So then I searched Rorik. There's one entry

This is a bit odd, but it's a bit fishy. He mentions fighting in the Great War, buying up the land, and miraculously making a profitable farm out of it. Yet in that book, dated sometime in the First Era, likely fairly soon after the Dragon War, a Rorik has a Steading, either the land was left barren for years

It should be noted that the [UESP is a bit suspicious of Rorik as well](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim_talk:Rorik). 

On the subject of Lokir, and the [talk page](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim_talk:Lokir) has an interesting link to [Bethesda's Creation Kit Preview video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udM4VvSL2VA), which shows a location called Lokir's Tomb being edited. It's a pretty fleshed out tomb, by the looks of things.

So now, and Bethesda put a video up of them making a location called Lokir's Tomb. If it were just one or just the other, I'd attribute it to just being a joke, but the two together suggest that we're going to be seeing a lot more of Rorikstead in the future.""

I also asked for permission to post this here

I checked around for more information on Lund:

""Welp, odd that nothing about him ever shows up in Rorikstead.""

.

Now then

[Here's the album of all the images. They're not sorted

First, no trapdoors, nothing out of the ordinary except for the Lute, the Soul Gem, and the book [*Spirit of the Daedra*](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/spirit-daedra). Now, the album has images from inside the book, but I linked the TIL page on it here. It's all a bit fishy, but nothing is necessarily wrong with a house inhabited by a former healer (Rorik's friend

Let's move to the next house. I checked in [Lemkil's](http://i.imgur.com/2iXeX.jpg) [Farmhouse](http://i.imgur.com/I7qhs.jpg). Nothing out of the ordinary there, let's move on again, to the last house in Rorikstead proper.

I checked [Cowflop](http://i.imgur.com/nNzZu.jpg) [Farmhouse](http://i.imgur.com/xifdb.jpg), staring me in the face, was a Soul Gem. Not even a hidden one, either. That's a bit odd, though by itself could be explained away by the presence of a long-lived elven woman, I suppose. It gets a little more fishy when you add it to the other one in Rorik's Manor, though. I also checked out the [Inn](http://i.imgur.com/A9KUL.jpg)

So, outside causes to the oddities of the Soul Gems.

I first checked the nearby [Bleakwind Bastion](http://i.imgur.com/MaVBg.jpg) (at least, and [*a Hagraven*](http://i.imgur.com/UDrCe.jpg). Inside the tower, there was [a shrine](http://i.imgur.com/UrlTP.jpg), a chest with leveled loot, and [two cairn-like](http://i.imgur.com/3URk5.jpg) [structures](http://i.imgur.com/k2BYA.jpg) covered in blood.

Next, it's turned into a Master Vampire's lair, and I don't know if it's normally inhabited by vampires or not without Dawnguard. However, you can also [see Rorikstead from it](http://i.imgur.com/3ga6w.jpg). Inside, there was a [Master Vampire](http://i.imgur.com/Bn2Ey.jpg), a [thrall](http://i.imgur.com/VJVIp.jpg), and a chest of leveled loot. There was a Death Hound and two thralls outside

Finally

So

What do you think? Are we making a mountain out of a molehill? Does the presence of a Hagraven a short walk away from Rorikstead have any significance? What about the Vampire Lair? Could there be some sort of influence from Nahagliiv's body on the people of Rorikstead? Could they be trapped in time

1358357197.0,16ozps,An unplanned post about Ulfric Stormcloak,,255,27,94,"This weird and rushed post is my feeble attempt to pool everything we know about Ulfric Stormcloak

Ulfric had a ten-year period of training with the Greybeards on High Hrothgar. He was actually invited up to the monastery by the Greybeards themselves

Ulfric, Ulfric was captured by the Thalmor at some point before they took the Imperial City.

He was subsequently tortured to and past his breaking point by Elenwen, as well as managing the Embassy outside of Solitude.

He's had the worst of it, honor, courage, spirit, what have you, in torture. We'll start with the latter.

Ulfric was broken in Thalmor torture. Now, the Thalmor have the capacity for mercy in the same sense that the Dwemer had that capacity. So, none at all. Their torture is brutal, efficient, and damned effective. Elenwen was the torturer assigned to Ulfric, and she broke him completely. He spilled information about the Imperial City and its defenders. While he gave them information after the City had been taken, he was led to believe that what he said was key in the Dominion's capture. That brings us back to the former: Ulfric now, is now feeling that every man, died because of his weakness. Every soldier who died died because of him. His comrades' and friends' blood is on his hands, not them.

And to his horror, including banning the worship of the god of Men, the patron of the Empire, and its founder. A Dragonborn among Dragonborn, and a true Nord. He not only failed untold thousands, but now he's failed the entirety of the Empire, and failed its founder and his god. But he's not the only one who failed. Every soldier who fought in the Legion failed. Every single death was utterly pointless. Every drop of blood spilled was a waste. There was no point to any of it.

Ulfric is the lowest of the low in his own estimation. And he returns to Skyrim an utterly broken man. The people of Windhelm are demanding the fight continue, that he could make it up to his god and his people. And so he did. The Jarl of Markarth, so grateful for Ulfric and his troops' aid, opened the Shrine of Talos to them so that they could worship. And then, the Empire betrayed him again in his mind, by letting the Thalmor capture him and his men, and trampling over the word of the Jarl of Markarth. The Empire sets up shop in Markarth, and he and his men rot in the Thalmor's prison. While he's in jail, and all men because they betrayed Talos. His hurt and self-loathing turn to hatred, wiser

Thalmor agents walk Skyrim freely. Khajiit (who Ulfric would have fought against during the War) are travelling through Skyrim with no regard for their laws and customs, are refusing to join the rest of the city, and are trying to recreate Morrowind instead of trying to adjust to Skyrim, like their kin in Riften have. To make it worse, they've been fighting with the Argonians who work the docks, and tensions are high throughout the city. Ulfric doesn't like either of them, and puts the Argonians outside the walls in a dormitory. Meanwhile, however

Then, and urge independence from the entity he feels has betrayed him, Skyrim, and Talos. He's ultimately unsuccesful, but his words win him the heart of the new High King. Soon after, Ulfric traveles to Solitude to meet with Torygg. Torygg respected Ulfric as a war-hero even before he stirred his heart with talk of freedom at the Moot, and so he thought he was there to further discuss Skyrim's independence, even if he couldn't officially say he was. By the time he figured out Ulfric meant to challenge him for the throne

You know the rest. Ulfric Shouted Torygg to the ground and stabbed him, and saw Skyrim's doom approaching. Ulfric renounced all claims to be a man of peace, and took on the role of the Tongues of old, calling for others to do the same. He then returned to Windhelm, and the Stormcloak Rebellion was on.

Before I end this, I forgot [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAS8y_RzLXY) initially, the video that inspired this entire post to begin forming in my head.

~~Ulfric may be acting rashly, or like him. But you should at least pity him, a broken man trying to do his best to hold his world together. He's in over his head, but not for the wrong reasons. He's definitely the most realized character in *Skyrim*, and I would rank him among the top four or five for the entire TES series.

And there you go. Ulfric Stormcloak.",,t5_2t5ay,1358438240.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/16ozps/an_unplanned_post_about_ulfric_stormcloak/
1359153792.0,17a79q,The Structure and Strength of the Argonian Army,xenoposeidon,250,42,169,"Just how strong is the An-Xileel?

Simply put

Lots of people have been repeatedly asking me about all the joking I do about Argonians being vastly superior in military strength to any other province of Empire on Tamriel. Many people find it funny when I make comments such as ""The Argonians could defeat the Aldmeri Dominion!"" They excuse is all for a hearty biased laugh. 

This right here is my attempt to educate many of you on the theoretical yet slightly confirmed superpower that is the An-Xileel.

So

**Command**

One of the most important part of an army and just what may draw the line between a legion and a raiding party is Strategy and Command. Many people excuse Argonian warfare (and their ways of life, they are high above any of those. 

Who commands a Legion? Why

Now who commands the An-Xileel military? The Hist do. A single conjoined mind of thousands of trees, and brutal. They are always aware of everything, can immediately send commands to any soldier's mind instantaneously, are always and frantically followed by their soldiers, and communicate with the other commanders at all time. Think of it like the conjoined mind of Alexander the Great, Julius Ceasar, Hannibal, and Shi Huangdi times a few hundred. That's something. But definitely not all.


**Communication**

Now here comes probably my favorite part of the An-Xileel military- ultimate communication. Communication between soldiers, etc. is very important. Without good communication the battle would chaotic and much friendly fire would occur. Supplies would be handed out unevenly, soldiers would fight individually, and basically instead of having an organized fighting force you would have the Tamrielic equivalent of an FPS Team Deathmatch team. 

Now normal Tamrielic armies may have pretty good communication, with working organs and blood veins making the body live and fight as though it was one object.

We know from Infernal City that no Argonians have any recollections of any actual battles. No memories

Well, becoming one mind with the Hist. When all Argonians are one with the Hist, all Argonians are also one mind with each other. They think together, move together, see together, hear together, smell together, they simply cannot comprehend it anymore and thus forget their experience. When you have thousands upon thousands of eyes it is a very incomprehensible experience. 

Anyways, and thus as long the Hist want to kill it they will. No one can escape. You know how no Dunmer in any book or any that you meet in game have any memories of the massacre no matter how old they are? Yeah, that's because every single Dunmer in the range of attack was killed. Every single one. No hostages, no escapes, no fleeing. They all die.

Now, yeah, Xeno, so the Hist are super advanced and shit, but you haven't even answered your own question! How strong is the actual army! Talk about the soldiers""

Will do happily. You just be patient.

**Soldiers and Fighting Efficiency**

It is very well known and can be recounted from pretty much any source about Argonians that they are the best Guerrilla fighters on Tamriel. Argonians are masters of sneaking, and sneak attacking. This makes the Argonians some of the best close quarters fighters on Tamriel in casual situations.

Note I said casual situations. That is, pirate attacks, raiding, Banditry, etc. 

The An-Xileel soldier ain't no casual shit.

We know from Infernal City that the Hist altered the Argonians to make them much more battle efficient. For an explanation of how they did so [please take a gander at this](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/161yk6/the_elder_way_hist_genetics_and_argonian/). Believe me they weren't kidding. Let's compare your average Joe'zijja to An-Xileelic warrior.

Joe'zijja stands 6 feet tall, and has the strength a tad bit below your average Imperial human. In hands to hand fighting he would able to easily defeat any common Imperial man, but not for example a Nord or Orc.

The average An-Xileelic warrior has been altered by the Hist to stand at just over 8 feet

And that's not all! Mr. Average An-Xileelic Warrior has a Naga buddy from some tribe south of Stormhold. When Naga Buddy charges at the Dunmer city, and has the strength of a young giant. In hand to hand fighting it is quite likely Naga buddy could easily punch a frost troll to death, or perhaps two.

So you see, right?

No. Definitely not.

**Weaponry**

In 3E433 when the gates of Oblivion opened thousands upon thousands of Argonians charged in

So, and lots more than they did Void Salts. There is also a reason why this particular loot wasn't also sold to Imperial Markets, because the Argonians wanted it for their army.

So

Beyond their altered giant mutant appearence in battle, and spears, and protected by heavy plates of Daedric armor only an altered mutant can run and comfortably fight in. 

Weaponry of the An-Xileelic legion is the best on Nirn. So is armor.

Now we know the Argonian soldier is the best and most well equipped. But how many are there?

The Most.

**Size**

The An-Xileelic army is by far and large (hehe) the most sizable army on Tamriel

We know undoubtedly that Argonians are best at survival and that they have the most children at birth

So now we know all about the actual swarm

Yup.

**Shadowscales**

We already discussed that there are many

The Shadowscales themselves number anything between 300 - 1000 assassins. Every single one acting and thinking together. Every single one given highest altering priority by the Hist. 

Go ahead

So let's wrap it all up: 

The Argonian army is the largest

1361323916.0,18uuw0,"""But MK doesn't have anything to do with Bethesda!""",Prince-of-Plots,236,34,116,"I couldn't take this any longer.

There's a horrible misconception that people just can't seem to shake (either by ignorance or when in denial - seriously

This doesn't come from having the wrong facts as much as it is a matter of misconstrued semantics: Michael Kirkbride is not employed by Bethesda Softworks. This is absolutely true. In fact

However, imply or prove that MK does not work for Bethesda. MK acts as an independent contractor outside of regular employment in other firms. ""Unlike an employee, an independent contractor does not work regularly for an employer but works as and when required"". It's that simple. This is how he has worked with Bethesda, over the course of 13 years, since he ceased to be a full-time employee.

These contracts can be small, such as writing *Knights of the Nine*. Here's a list of examples of MK's visible recent contributions to TES games (non-exhaustive):

***Oblivion***:

* MK wrote much dialogue

* He wrote the *Knights of the Nine* DLC.

* He wrote many in-game books for *Oblivion*

* He was even credited as part of the development team as an additional writer (one of two

***Skyrim***:

* Heimskr in Whiterun recites lines of *""From the Many-Headed Talos""*

* The White-Gold Concordat was MK's idea.

* After *Skyrim*'s announcement

 * The concept of painted cows was included

 * The Companions are included in *Skyrim* as a playable faction. The Companions' hall

* The in-game book *""The Book of the Dragonborn""* (not written by MK) explicitly references the Towers - and them going down one by one - which is a concept introduced by MK in his out-of-game text *""Nu-Mantia Intercept""*.

I'll make it clear: I am *not* telling people that MK's work needs to be accepted as canon by anyone, and Bethesda [does not ignore his out-of-game contributions](http://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1211123-michael-kirkbride/page__view__findpost__p__18300835) to The Elder Scrolls.",,False,,t5_2t5ay,1361348134.0,Council,

**Of Ancient Magicks

-A consolidated theory on the fall of the Falmer race using recently surfaced  information, The Aetherium Wars by Taron Dreth and the always invaluable The Falmer: A study by Ursa Uthrax.

Complied by scholars of the Imperial University


Long have the enigmatic races of Dwemer and Falmer both fascinated and confused Imperial Historians. The total and sudden disappearance of the Dwemer

Ironically, - the Falmer or  ‘snow elves’ that has shined a light on the Dwemer and exposed some very dark and very ugly truths about this advanced and powerful race.

Firstly some background, shattering the Falmer and driving the few that remained by that time into hiding.

The Falmer were thought lost to time, currently the most extensive work of knowledge on the Falmer race. 

They did not die, but at a horrible cost- the Falmer were fed poisoned mushrooms that grow in Blackreach which eventually drove them blind, not just the first generation, but every generation after that, until the Falmer lost all sight to the darkness. The Dwemer were cruel taskmasters, using the crippled Falmer as slaves until an eventual and inevitable rebellion known as the ‘War of the Crag’.

There is no doubt in this scholars mind that during this time Blackreach served as a prison, its secure location, easy availability of the poisoned mushrooms that enforced their hold on the Falmer , and its close proximity to the mines (which will be addressed in a later section) would have turned the dark beauty of Blackreach into a den of pain and horror for the survivors of the Falmer race.

But there is another side to this story
 
Recent discoveries by the late Prof Katria (posthumously decorated) and the scholar Taron Dreth, Bthar-zel ( though this may be an outpost of the larger nearby Bthardamz), Raldbthar and Mzulft, working on a joint project at Bthalft. It appears that such alliances to work towards large technological advances were not uncommon, however it also appears that this alliance did not last. What the Dwemer discovered was so powerful they went to war with each other all seeking to wrest the ultimate power for themselves.

What as this power? Aetherium, a gleaming crown inset with Glowing milky blue orbs that shine from some vast internal power.

By now I’m sure you as the reader are wondering

Everything.

The Aetherium was mined deep within the Blackreach, would have been little surprise to the magically powerful Falmer, hardly a prize worth going to extreme measures to protect. But Aetherium? A substance so precious and powerful the Dwemer would wage war upon themselves for its control? Now that is something to murder for.

It is this scholar’s assertion that the Falmer were blinded to protect not secrets of Dwemer technology as is commonly believed, perhaps even with the intent of total genocide, to protect their powerful discovery. Some of my associates have even speculated the rather morbid possibility that, with Blackreach being rich in raw soul gems, and Dwemer  animunculi requiring charged soul gems to operate, the Falmer could have served as...  dare I say it a sacrificial power source.

The sad remnants of the Falmer were only saved by civil war within the Dwemer alliance

A grim tale indeed,  -  during the Dwemer civil war, and subsequent Falmer rebellion they fled “into the deeper caves”, denying Dwemer entry.  *It is possible that deep within the Blackreach raw untouched Aetherium may still be found!*
 
A stretch to be sure

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Addendum: Discussions with the honoured Quintus Umbranox

That the Dwemer never experimented with Aetherium again in the ~450years till thier disappearance and the chances of Dwemer walking away from a power source willingly are zero to none indicates that there was likely an external force preventing them form accessing the raw Aetherium.

A look into why Khajiit theft is misunderstood.",Mr_Flippers,194,29,28,"I'm writing this after ginja_ninja's... remarks about Khajiit stealing (wubwubwubwub). It's really unrelated but it brought back the reminder that Khajiit are very misunderstood by both players

First, I cant think of names so bugger it I'm going to use their titles.

Shopkeeper wants assistant to move some things around upstairs

To the Assistant, it didn't tell him ""you there, I'm the Shopkeepers fish!"". It was just there and on a crate in a place they both work in. Who owns every fish in the world? no one. The fish was, as far as Assistant could tell, belonging to no one. If it didn't belong to anyone, it was Assistant's for the taking. Then he gets taken by authorities for having his lunch! Ridiculous.

You could say that Khajiit think in regards to property that if there's nothing clearly stating what something belongs to

Another example, there is plenty of room in the house to share. More come into the house; Khajiit still enjoys his time staying in his part of the house. the house becomes really crowded, so Khajiit decides to leave because he was no longer enjoying the house, he will find another place to rest. It may not be *his* place, but it will be *a* place.

So

To most on Tamriel, but a thief may not be a thief.

Observing the well known word/prefix ""Dar"". It means many things, ""to kill"" (rarely used) and a person who's skilled with their hands (which can be a blacksmith, carpenter, what have you). One who is termed ""dar"" or given the prefix ""dar"" is a clever person and rather talented, a useless person doesn't get the honour of a prefix. Why is a thief clever? simple, they had to have the cunning and smarts to properly take from Khajiit. This is not like a person walking into the house and ""taking"" one floor of the house from the example Khajiit, Khajiit know their possessions and to have taken them undetected is a great skill.

Let's look at the supposed god Rajhin, personally I'd say he's more a saint than a god and was ""deified"" to be an example of cleverness (which is something that Khajiit respect greatly, it's integral in their nature and whoever can do it better than any other is obviously going to be liked).

Now, y, z from Eg'Example"", in fact, it's seen as a filthy act of a lowlife. Most Khajiit belong to something, whether it be a clan, town, they use their talents to benefit what they are a part of. Thieves who act selfishly and for themselves are degenerates for they don't act to benefit something else. But

This isn't to say there aren't proper thieves amongst Khajiit, if they just ran up and took your bag, they probably won't live long if they're that stupid amongst a race known for having one thought, one expression and one sentence all different from each other.

Now you'll probably ask ""but so many Khajiit in games I play *are* thieves/criminals, but they do exist. Most aren't decent folk; Ri'saad in Skyrim, when asked about his homeland, eventually stops and says ""Ri'saad will talk no more, for he misses his home"" or something along those lines. Just using him as an example, there's a few reasons as to why he isn't there, either A: He's no longer welcome after whatever criminal activity he may have participated in or B: he is VERY faithful and is following the moonpath that leads him throughout Skyrim. That last one may be a possibility for Ri'Saad and other caravaners

1354433228.0,1455tg,The Form of the Atronachs,Ishullanu,182,23,31," As commonly known, and storm. They are favored by conjurers as they seem less ambitious or malevolent as other daedra, as long as they are true to their nature aesthetics wouldn't be a concern. I posit what shape and characteristics an atronach takes on is determined by the predominant cultural view of  that atronach’s element. Put simply

First let us examine the [Flame Atronach’s appearance in Morrowind](http://i.imgur.com/kn4UU.jpg). Here we see a clearly masculine figure, moving across the ashlands with a confident sense of belonging. All of these qualities mirror how the Dunmeri people view the element of flame, especially those who lived on the island of Vvardenfell. Those who lived in the shadow of Red Mountain knew that fire could be an hostile and persistent force. Groups who traveled across Vvardenfell consistently braved intense heat and open lava, in addition to the ever-present threat of full eruption. Even though the Dunmer had grown accustomed to fire, it was not seen as a comfort but as a threat. 

These feeling on the nature of fire contrast sharply with the views of the Nord’s in Skyrim, armor is sparse, creating not much more than a silhouette. Some horns are present, but nothing directly threatening. The appearance brings with it a change in presence, Skyrim’s flame atronachs move with a distinct grace, literally floating over the terrain. As inappropriate as it may sound, the Skyrim atronach’s movements suggest an intentional allure, in the coldest land in Tamerial in is understandable that warmth is a desirable thing. The atronachs flighty and quick movements over the ground could be representing the fleeting nature of heat in the frozen wastelands.  So here

Interestingly enough the [flame atronachs seen in Cyrodiil] (http://i.imgur.com/oQpYN.jpg) seem to be a blend of aspects of Skyrim’s and Morrowind’s atronachs. While still female in appearance, nor the deep necessity for fire felt in the colder provinces.

Moving on to frost atronachs, there is little that represents this atronach’s element. In Vvardenfell there are not many places one would encounter natural ice, and would more likely come across it as an offensive weapon of some monster or man. So the ice atronach reinforces that link, portraying itself as little more than a warrior of ice.

[Skyrim’s frost atronach] (http://i.imgur.com/NoyVM.jpg) is a sentient mountain of ice. There is almost no characterization of the ice, this intimacy produces a form that is little more than an animation of what already exists. 

Again, but Imperials lack the total acceptance of the cold that allows the the Nord’s to see frost atronachs without humanization.

If this theory of societal belief and interpretation effecting an atronach’s physical forms is correct, or would their exodus to Solstheim move their collective view of flame closer to the longing of the Nords? And one final supposition, could an individual’s emotions towards an element be powerful enough to overwhelm the views of their people, and summon forth an atronach that assumes a form representing what this element means to specifically that individual?",,False,,1355822612.0,t3_1455tg

1362788879.0,19y118,The Lore-Correct Size of Tamriel 2.0! (Pictures inside),xenoposeidon,161,18,56,"Hello scholars

In this thread I hope to finally put the debate about the comparative size of Tamriel to rest. I also finally got to work on Photoshop a little and finally make some visuals to show just how tiny Tamriel really is.

**Introduction**

The size of Tamriel has been a subject of some heated debate over the last year. Some tried to determine Tamriel's size using game-distances, both of which were posted here in the subreddit. These two are (named elegantly by myself):

[**The ICCL Scale**](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/sd5o6/the_size_of_tamriel/)

The ICCL scale, I came up with Tamriel being around the size of Egypt. While this was a very exciting thread, and I myself felt very proud of myself, a better scale came along,

[**The PGEMRM Scale**](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/ui64h/tamriels_size_in_square_miles/)

The PGEMRM scale, as well as is probably more accurate due to the fact that maps of the Lilmoth area are always differing due to the entire region sinking into the sea at times. 

Using the PGEMRM scale I was able to come up with a few visuals to show the true size of Tamriel. 

**Gallery**

I'm sorry about the quality and placement of these. Saying I'm good with Photoshop is like saying a common Dunmer is good at surviving the invasion of the An-Xileeli horde

I posted this on another part of reddit related to Skyrim and was suggested that I repost my findings here.

I have spent quite a bit of time on translating the second page of the Oghma infinium and at last I was able to translate it!!!
So the issues with the second page were the following

1) The page is written in a spiral text starting from the upper left and continuing to the lower left. The solution was to break the page down into each line horizontally so it was easier to read. The link to the image is provided below:

2) Not all the letters can be seen due to it being washed out. By using a photo editor your can adjust the contrast

3) Portuguese! Yup that is what it translates into and google translate is your friend but it does take some slight altering of order since we do not have a guide for punctuation.
Now for the Translation!!!

Line 1:

Portuguese: O de historia de Nirn foi vasto e profundo a u ir de Winterhold magia mente fala ele

English: The history of the Nirn was vast and deep go au Winterhold magic of mind he speaks

Line 2::

I was always taught to start essays with a good attention getter, if only vaguely, to be related to Tiber Septim's ascension to godhood. There's a lot of ways you can explain it to a fan who doesn't understand a lot about the lore, saying that Talos watches over the men races of Cyrodiil and provided fertile land for the farmers of Cyrodiil. But the official channels don't say that. We've all accepted the answer we've been given for the lack of the endless jungle, but now the developers have rejected that, and replaced it with one of the scariest answers I could imagine.

&gt;[#ESO's Cyrodiil is based on current Tamriel lore. The original ""endless jungle"" description is considered a transcription error.](https://twitter.com/TESOnline/status/265849694708719616)

So there you have it. The jungle description was just a transcription error that spread from [all of the Morrowind Savants, editions 1 and 2](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/pocket-guide-empire-and-its-environs-first-edition), and [The Mythic Dawn Commentaries.](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Mythic_Dawn_Commentaries)

What does this mean? What precedent does this set? To me, an MMO needs to make its money back.

So where else have they strayed from what has become to be accepted? In the meat section here, but some come from other sources. If you don't see a source, it's from the Ask Anything posts on the TESO website. A couple things to keep in mind first:

* We all know how ridiculous the factions and the plot are

* I personally am not planning on touching this game at all

-Specifically related to the Aldmeri Dominion

This is a big nitpicky one

&gt;Some people are worried that your interpretation/version of the Aldmeri Dominion isn't as extreme as they were described in the ""Pocket Guide to the Empire."" 

The response:

&gt;Yes – and remember, on the other hand, regard them as racist authoritarians out to return the humans of Tamriel to a condition little better than slavery.

I can accept the answer, but every empire needs their flaws. This makes me fear for any concept of depth in the factions at all. Will all the storylines be the same with different characters and places, much like Skyrim's conflict? Only time will tell. I do reject the claims of bias and defamation towards the Imperial Geographic Society. Reading the descriptions of the city makes it seem a magnificent and utopian, which brings me to another question and answer.

&gt;The buildings of Alinor are said to look like they are ""made from glass or insect wings."" If the Summerset Isles are traversable at release will we see a design reminiscent of this? And will we see the Crystal Tower for that matter?! 

&gt;When The Elder Scrolls Online launches, certainly, but it’s also practical, constructed of real-world materials. Architects can’t make buildings out of poetry!

While it's true that the descriptions in PGE are rather fanciful

&gt;A. We know from existing lore that Valenwood is an exaggeration of our own world’s jungles and deep forests. Combine that with a bit of the look seen in The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind

&gt;Q. How do you intend to portray the cannibalism of the Bosmer? 

&gt;A. For the Wood Elves

(read as: we don't plan to)

&gt;Q. Most of the uses of moon-sugar are benign

&gt;The Altmer

-Specifically related to the Daggerfall Covenant

So far

-Specifically related to the Ebonheart Pact

The ""uneasy"" alliance. What a surprise that some of the background sits a little uneasy with me. By this point

&gt;Q. Where is the main base of Ebonheart Pact? In which city will we find Jorunn the Skald-King?

&gt;A. The throne of Eastern Skyrim is in Windhelm

I said I wouldn't complain about the races too much

In conclusion, like the civil war conflict in Skyrim, none I can think of this gross implementation of Elder Scrolls.

&gt;Elder Scrolls are artifacts of immense power that aid an alliance in the ongoing battle to control Tamriel by conferring bonuses to every member of that alliance. Each alliance has a special stronghold in Cyrodiil where their Elder Scrolls are kept and protected – but enemy alliances can break in and take them if they are not guarded properly. Once access is gained and a Scroll taken

Does the Dovahkiin have Dragon Blood, or a Dragon's soul?",,151,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1c81vg/its_time_to_put_this_puppy_to_bed_does_the/, which is a whole different can of worms I will touch on as sparingly as I can. But the key thing about it is that the Amulet is supposed to contain both the souls (or oversoul) of the dead emperors who had this ""shared blood""

I had originally meant to do this via screenshots, looking at each and every instance the words ""blood"" and ""soul"" come up. Spoiler: it's a *lot*.

Then, the last Dragonborn. I'll now paste the exact quotes of dialogue that says the Dragonborn has dragon blood, and who said it:

* The Dragonborn is an exception to all the rules - the Dragon Blood itself is a gift of the gods. If we accept one gift, which transcends the restrictions which bind other mortals. (Arngeir)

* That is commendable. But remember

* Those born with the Dragon Blood in 'em. Like old Tiber Septim himself. (Nord Guard)

* The Akaviri blood seal can only be opened with the right kind of blood. Your blood

* So... you spoke to Paarthurnax. The dragonblood burns bright within you. (Arngeir)

* When you Shout

* But for you

* We are here to guide you in that pursuit

* You are not the first. There have been many of the Dragon Blood since Akatosh first bestowed that gift upon mortalkind. (Arngeir)

* Aaah... yes! Sossedov los mul. The dragonblood runs strong in you. It is long since I had the pleasure of speech with one of my own kind. (Note: Sossedov is literally blood of the dragon) (Paarthurnax)

* Ah! It's been too long since last I faced a doom-driven hero of the dragon blood. (Tsun)

* Trust your instincts

* So. You have made your way here

* Dov wahlaan fah rel. We were made to dominate. The will to power is in our blood. You feel it in yourself

* It means you have the Dragon Blood - you have an inborn ability to use your Voice the way dragons do. (either Ulfric or Rikke)

* Ah... here's the blood seal. Another of the lost Akaviri arts. No doubt triggered by... well

* Esbern's probably right. Try using your blood on the carved seal on the floor. (Delphine)

Now, and who said it:

*     [metapad: Search string not found]

In fact, and combat lines, there are around twenty lines speaking about the Dovahkiin's soul in vanilla *Skyrim*, three of which I've pulled for this post, and **all** of which are found in the Daedric quest The Black Star.

* Mayln's enchantments are broken. Hold on. I'm going to pull your soul out of there. Brace yourself. (Nelacar)

* I could soul trap you. Place you inside the Star. Then bring you back once Malyn has been dealt with. (Nelacar)

* But be careful. If you die inside the Star

Nelacar is a Altmer mage who uses a special type of soul trap spell on you to send you into the broken Azura's Star that works while you're still living. He takes hold of your soul, sans the tether, is out of your body at this point, and is Nelacar's plaything, essentially. And let's not forget that Zurin soul traps Wulfharth by the *Arcturian Heresy*.

Consider dragons. In-game, you cannot revive a dragon, and you cannot soul trap a dragon. The spells simply do not work, regardless of your level, perks, or race. The only one who can revive dragons that we've seen is Alduin, by means of a special Shout, because no other mortal can even touch a dragon's soul.

Compare the sources. Nord folklore, an actual dragon (the brother of Alduin himself, second-oldest of the dragons) and a *god* all say that the Dragonborn (and all Dragonborn throughout history, by association) have dragon blood in their veins. No one in-game says that the Dragonborn has a dragon's soul. No book says it, no rumors say it, no gameplay even suggests it (and yes, we'll get to Miraak). In *Oblivion*'s lore, and thus be counted as a legitimate Dragonborn Emperor.

The most overwhelming thing is this: when the Dragonborn travels to Sky Haven Temple with Esbern and Delphine, halted the Akaviri invasion of Tamriel during the Second Era at Pale Pass with the power of his Thu'um. When the Dragonguard heard it, they dropped to their knees and pledged themselves to his service. The Dragonguard, upon building Sky Haven Temple, locked it by a shrine to Reman, including a blood seal and a giant bust of Reman himself. The blood seal responds to the blood of a Dragonborn. Either that means that all Dragonborn are related (which would lead to some odd lineage), or Dragon Blood is shared between all Dragonborn.

This all worked well until *Dragonborn*

Once you arrive in Solstheim and head up to the Temple of Miraak, the realm of Herma-Mora, where Miraak easily defeats you in combat. From this point on, if you kill a dragon before ending the *Dragonborn* main questline, Miraak will show up, taunt you a little, and steal the soul from you. At the end of the questline, who absorbs the souls of three additional dragons before being battered down to low health. Once you defeat him Herma-Mora will tear open a rift from Apocrypha and gore Miraak through with a tentacle. As he withdraws it

A lot of people take the skeletalization of Miraak and the ten souls you receive as you absorbing his soul somehow. There are two issues with this idea. First, plus however many he steals from you. By rights, you ought to receive more dragon souls from him. But that numbering makes it impossible for Miraak's soul to be one of those ten you receive regardless. Second, Miraak is Dragonborn, and by everything else we know about individual Dragonborn, they have mortal souls (able to be manipulated by magic, enantiomorph, who is different simply because of her unique circumstances)

I propose two alternatives to this flawed idea

First, rather than his. Second, he was the Champion and servant of Herma-Mora, who ultimately killed him by goring him with a tentacle. This was obviously an act of anger, and Herma-Mora exacted his final revenge. He burned Miraak's body, released his souls, and gave them to you

Now

All this to say: being Dragonborn is a mixing of dragon's blood and mortal soul. Always has been,,False,,t5_2t5ay,1365796715.0,,True
1361449285.0,18y858,An Essay on the Mammoths of Skyrim,Anhrl,143,20,35,"An Essay on the Mammoths of Skyrim


By Levan Matius


The mammoths of Skyrim are truly remarkable creatures, making the beast easily recognizable. They can be found in many of Skyrim's holds, in particular, Whiterun, the Pale, and Eastmarch. They are often seen alongside the fearsome giants, which may explain why little is truly known about the mammoths. The aim of this essay is to provide some insight on these magnificent creatures.


Firstly, suggesting that the giants rely on them for food, but it seems that the mammoths are not seen as mere cattle, but are prized companions. Giant-tamed mammoths are distinguishable by the [intricate carvings in their tusks](http://i.imgur.com/t0bvnFk.jpg), revealing that a great deal of care is shown towards them.


It is interesting to note that mammoth skulls found in the wild have no markings upon their tusks. What happens to the remains of tamed mammoths? Some travelers have observed giants standing forlornly beside mammoth corpses, many [mammoth skulls](http://i.imgur.com/Vwtwxij.jpg) can be found in [giant camps](http://i.imgur.com/uw6kPU7.jpg), placed up high, almost as if they were objects to be revered.


Some scholars say that the mammoths are held in such high regard because they are, this has unpleasant implications, but they reason that it is why there are only male giants in Skyrim. There are a few flaws with this argument. If the absence of female giants can be explained by this, then why do we not see any giant children? Furthermore, the existence of wild mammoths shows that they can reproduce without the intervention of giants.


It seems unlikely that the mammoths are used as mates, though mainly for their tusks, fur, and meat.


Mammoth tusks can be made into many things. When ground into a fine powder, it is not too useful, so people tend not to turn the tusks into powder. As a result, this ingredient is very rare.


Tusks can also be used to create jewelry. Ivory rings are popular among the upper class citizens of Skyrim. Not to mention


The khajiit in particular seem to have an obsession with mammoth tusks and fur; khajiit caravans in Skyrim seek the tusks


Furthermore


It is regretful that we mainly interact with the mammoths by butchering them

There.  Everybody done giggling?  Okay

Now that my activity in the Amaranth Hunt is finally dying down somewhat

In the 36 Lessons Vivec spends a lot of time trying to impress upon the reader how important it is to ""know Love"" and to ""practice"" it.  But it immediately becomes apparent that Vivec's concept of Love is quite different from the traditional modern Western concept.

It didn't take much digging to discover that Vivec's Love is quite a lot like Aleister Crowley's Love

So to explain Love we have to talk about Crowley's concept of Will.

This isn't a concept entirely specific to Crowley's work in Thelema, even as early as Lesson 1:

'For I have crushed a world with my left hand

Thelema does not differentiate between an individual and God: ""Every man and every woman is a star.""  The Lessons do not differentiate either.  Vivec, Vivec is described as being star-shaped.  In Sermon 36, those who looked upon Ayem are overcome by the meanings of the Stars.  And Dagoth Ur promises that he brings a Star, which is himself.  Within every person lies the divine, and the Lessons suggest that this is more evident in the powerful and the god-like.  But it is obvious that the Lessons wish us to pursue our own Stars, which in turn is the pursuit of the divine in all of us.

""Will"" is probably the most important concept in Thelemetic thought

This is not ""desire.""  Thelema does not encourage people to go around doing whatever they want.  Instead, because that desire clouds our judgment.  Acting with (and not against) our Will requires a sort of void of mind, much like the void receptacle at the center of the promise of the wise.

Love is only true Love when it is ""under Will.""  While Will is the Law, Crowley gives us plenty of it.  It is not what most people consider the act of loving someone emotionally, or kindness, or sentimentality.  ""Hate itself is almost like Love,"" writes Crowley.  It is perhaps easy to think of Love as the joining of the enantiomorphic concepts of Nuit and Hadit, Crowley's terms for the immeasurable all-being (Nuit) and the infinitely small center point of everything (Hadit).  Perhaps we can find a common theme with Anu and Padomay?

So

Okay

To Love in Mundus means action with the goal of becoming divine.  Vivec does not live in our world, their Will.

In the Lessons, that his Will is the same Will as every other mortal in his domain.  He fully possesses knowledge of the metaphysical structure of the entire span of existence, so perhaps he is correct.  Or perhaps he believes that there are common events and activities all mortals must universally experience before they gain the wisdom to pursue their own Stars.

Before, even if he had to drag them kicking and screaming.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To understand CHIM you must firstly understand that the whole of the TES universe is the dream of the Godhead

CHIM, you zero-sum out of existence, which is not desired.

Examples of those who have attained CHIM are Talos and Vivec. They attained CHIM by using the method of the Tower which is explained by Vivec himself in [his teachings](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/tower). In order to find the Tower you must first see [the wheel](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Dharma_Wheel.svg/220px-Dharma_Wheel.svg.png)

&gt; We are the hub, the circle within the circle, only the border to ours is so much easier to see. Stand in its flux and remain whole of mind. Look at it sideways and see the “I”.

As Vivec states. Look at the Wheel sideways and you see the 'I' of the Godhead. The singular which dreams the plurals. This sudden realisation is what kickstarts CHIM. This quote, it also explains Lorkhan's purpose. Lorkhan saw the Tower without the Wheel when he travelled to the edge of the Aurbis:

&gt;  As the gods and demons of the Aurbis erupted

&gt; He saw the Tower

Lorkhan saw the Tower and realised that he was a part of the Godhead but somehow he did not attain CHIM and neither did he zero-sum. What we do know though is that it inspired him to create Mundus. He created it so others could attain CHIM:

&gt; And this is the most-reached destination of all that embark upon this road. Why would Lorkhan and his (unwitting?) agents sabotage their experiments with the Tower? Why would he crumble that which he esteems?

&gt; Perhaps he failed so you might know how not to.

In order to understand CHIM though you must also understand Love. In order to truly attain CHIM you must also [Know Love](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/pojhf/know_love/) although it is true to say that attaining CHIM is actually an act of Egotistic Altruism. Both Vivec and Talos loved themselves so much that by proxy they loved everything else because they were also it. By that logic the applications of CHIM are also bound by Love. After achieving CHIM you become a lucid dreamer within the dream and can begin to change and manipulate the dream since you intimately know the land beneath your feet like you know your hands. However

Today marks one year from when /r/teslore had its [beginnings](http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/mq5y9/elder_scrolls_lore_subreddit/) as a humble little subreddit for Elder Scrolls lore. We've come a long way since [this time last year](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/by_id/t3_mqd3m,t3_mr19b,t3_mqfnb,t3_mqdvx,t3_mqjz6,t3_mqgpl,t3_mqhhs,t3_mqh38,t3_mqsl5,t3_mqq30

/r/teslore has the greatest community I've had the pleasure to watch grow and be a part of. I've loved moderating it [since day one](http://i.imgur.com/k0rqo.png)

This whole thing was meant to be a lot bigger (and I'm sure I'll take the heat from xeno later), but please talk about anything and everything here.

Also: what will it take to get some folks in the IRC? It's usually a ghost-town

In case you have never met one of these notoriously rare creatures, and have about three or four wisps following nearby. The traits of the Wispmother have been discussed in the in-game book: [The Wispmother](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:The_Wispmother)

In that book it is proposed that Wispmothers are Falmer in origin.

&gt; Based on his extensive research into necromancy and Cyrodiil's Ayleid culture, these are no mere ghosts - they are a cult of powerful sorceresses who achieved eternal life through undeath.

And being the self proclaimed expert on Ayleids that I am I must say I agree with Master Sarethi. The Ayleids, so if the Ayleids had advanced Necromantic Magic, why can't the Falmer?

I would also like to show you this close up of a Wispmother and a Falmer (post-corruption). [Pic](http://i.imgur.com/Vocg7.jpg) (credit goes to Saint_Jiub on the forums for it.)

1357708404.0,168dts,A friendly reminder and an introduction to the subreddit's policies. ,xenoposeidon,113,18,34,"Hello

If you are a previous member of the subreddit, hopefully you know them.

This thread is mostly intended for new scholars though, it is quite important.

Dear New Scholars, as some of you might have noticed, and that is due to the fact that our scholars have the dedication and devotion to be able to help out curious folks such as you searching to learn more about the universe of the Elder Scrolls series.

As I've already explained in the Community Thread, and deep curiosity. A very crucial part of /r/teslore that is sometimes frequently overlooked by new scholars is focus and relevancy, though. Without staying on focus and keeping relevant to lore in /r/teslore threads, the subreddit devolves into a mess that nobody has time for cleaning up. 

We understand that you all very much like joking around about cheese, but we are afraid to tell you that this is not /r/skyrim. It is a different subreddit with a different community and different policies. For example, think of /r/skyrim like the United States and /r/teslore like Europe or the UK. When you go as an American tourist to a European country you should always dress differently because of the colder weather, no? Same goes for /r/teslore and /r/skyrim, you act accordingly depending on which subreddit you are in.

Sadly just today we mods have been forced to remove quite a few comments due to the new populace

The first step in fitting in is reading the subreddit rules and memorizing them. Unlike in /r/skyrim when lots of stuff is accepted no matter how irrelevant or inappropriate, folks, that's just how moderation works.

The 2nd best way to fit in well is to start building a more orderly and organized personality when in /r/teslore. /r/teslore is like a fun, not your ability to make puns about dragons.


Last and not least, and get to know your fellow scholars like friends. We are all a small, tightly knit community in /r/teslore, we don't fight or offend here. 

With that all good and said

Thank you for reading and have a good day.

1355832371.0,151r8r,Orsinium and the Orcs: After the Warp in the West [x-post from /r/Orsimer],myrrlyn,104,8,45,"The Orsimer have appeared in all games. Initially (*Arena* and *Daggerfall*) they were merely NPC monsters

Orcs, whom I discussed previously, are outcast from their communities and seen as disgusting, bestial, and unwanted. The Orsimer have animalistic qualities (green skin, bone ridges, the massive mandible fangs, they have been reviled

It is little wonder, Orcs are merely stronger than goblins and more clever than ogres. They roam Tamriel and attack fiercely on sight, for millennia of conflict has left a mutual distrust. The Orcs attack to defend themselves from Tamriel, and Tamriel attacks to defend themselves from the Orcs.

Although the Orcish talent at metalworking has been known for some time by the events of *Daggerfall, but neither is trusted.

By the time the Blades agent ventured forth to the Iliac Bay, when the Warp occurred, was one of the parties to gain control of the fearsome Numidium.

The actual events of the Warp are, as far as the rest of Tamriel was concerned, Daggerfall, Sentinel, Wayrest, and Orsinium ALL managed to seize the Numidium, conquer their surroundings and possibly even each other

Dragon Breaks make bad acid look calm and rational.

Regardless, independent entity. It was able to show that the Orcs were not monsters but mer (though they are alone in the Elvish community in that they forsake their Aldmeri name Orsimer in favor of the human word Orc - likely because the elves cast them out as inferiors, while men merely fought them as equals), and Gortwog began requesting a grant from the Empire for his territory to be recognized as a province in its own right.

With the events following the Warp

Shortly after the Warp, but they were not put down on sight). Cyrodiil's Champion encountered even more integration of Orcs into society, as their innate metalworking skill made them prized to the Legion, and thus the Empire.

By the time the Dovahkiin arose, they were not welcomed with open arms either. Many Orcs chose to remain isolated in Strongholds, four of which dot Skyrim's countryside. Those who live in the cities form the next large group of the population. They are almost always smiths or smelters. It is common practice for Orcs to enlist in the legion, and their armor is highly prized.

A small number of Orcs have managed to become successful members of society. The famed High Rock chef known only as the Gourmet was revealed to be a wandering Orc. Gortwog was a successful politician. There are rumors that the Nerevarine, but every race claims that one of their own was these legendary, mysterious heroes.

In any case

As all the races of Tamriel can show, behavior or achievement. The self-possessed Altmer can be just as vicious and violent, the Dunmer are even more xenophobic, the Argonians as hostile to interlopers. Civilization is about clothes, metaphorically and literally. That is the gift of Gortwog.",,False,t5_2t5ay,True

A run-down of the horrible and confusing mess that we know as the Dragon God of Time,,110,15,49,"This post has been quite a long time in coming, and a few other failed ideas. The reason I've decided to do this in as straightforward a way as possible has quite a lot to do with the subject matter: Time is one of the most convoluted aspects of TES lore, let's begin.

---

In most creation myths, exist. Then, at some nebulous point afterwards, the idea of Time is realized. I'll call this force Aka, or ""dragon"".  But at some point, Aka Broke. This unrecorded Dragon Break, the first of many, Aka-Tusk. And from Aka-Tusk

First came Alduin, he has no role that we can tell.

Then, though he doesn't enter into the story in full yet, is Lorkhan, subgradient to Sithis, subgradient to Padomay.

Alduin and Auri-El are the first aspects of what will later come to be known as the Aka-Tusk oversoul. An oversoul is simply a collective of souls or aspects that form one greater being, but also makes up part of Aka-Tusk.

Then comes the event known as Convention. While all of creation has been going on, who builds it, but realizes the trap it presents, and flees with his followers, the Magne Ge, into Aetherius, tearing holes into the Mundus. Meanwhile, specifically on Nirn

Auri-El, and Lorkhan's Heart is ripped out, and shot across Tamriel into the waters. It will later cause the formation of Red Mountain, and indeed all of Vvardenfell. And the system of kalpas begins.

From this point on

Alduin decides to ignore his calling. My own personal theory is that Lorkhan whispered the truth of the Tower to Alduin, Alduin goes rogue, and selfishly comes into the world to enslave it rather than to eat it. He and his dragon kin enslave the Nords, who were Lorkhan's chief followers during the battle before Convention. They force them to create a Cult where the Nords worship the dragons as living gods, which goes largely uninterrupted until the Nords rebel. Initially, they had no chance, but one of the kinder original spirits (whom the Nords call Kyne), they taught the Nords how to Shout as dragons do

But while the Children of the North are fighting and throwing down their old masters with sword and Voice, who came out of the Aldmer of the Summerset Isles, who were Auri-El's chief followers. They took the humans as their slaves because they saw them as lesser beings, and built a great city in the shape of a Wheel, with a Tower in the middle. Eventually, a slave named Alessia led her kin against their masters, and the routed the elves out of Cyrodiil. They fled into Valenwood, and the First Empire was born. The Nords came down in the waning years of her life and joined the Alessian Order, their name for Auri-El. The god that was wholly Cyrod was Shezzar. Shezzar was the god of Man, is another name for Lorkhan.

In time, took most of Tamriel, though they could not wrestle Valenwood or Morrowind from the grip of mer, nor did they attempt to conquer the alien land of Argonia.

But our focus needs to hone in on one particular event.

On her deathbed, and was the first of many that entered into the oversoul it created. The Empire passed to her descendants, and the Alessian Order kept up purging elves from the lands of men.

But something entirely different, led by their prophet Marukh, were furious that their chief god Akatosh was simply Auri-El in all but name, and so they devised a cunning plan. They went to the top of White-Gold Tower, and danced a powerful dance. And the Dragon broke again, this time for a little over a thousand years.

During this Dragon Break, cleansing him from it, and cementing Akatosh, an empty husk, in his place. Next, and most crucially, they took Shezzar

This happening in untime is key: from that time forward, every possibility, Akatosh took Auri-El's place, as did Shezzar. They were one, Auri-El, Akatosh, and Shezzar. Which means Lorkhan and Auri-El are united in Akatosh. Akatosh is the schizophrenic, leaving a curious quirk to him.

That means that Akatosh was actually the being who blessed Alessia

So what does this mean for our oversoul? Aka-Tusk used to be Alduin and Auri-El, Alduin and Akatosh, who is Shezzar (Lorkhan) and Auri-El (Akatosh). Akatosh is greater than Aka-Tusk, for he exists inside and outside of Aka-Tusk. The parts are greater than the whole. Akatosh replaces the concept of Aka-Tusk in the minds of the peoples of Tamriel, even reaching as far as to supplant the idea of Aka-Tusk as Bormahu, as Father, to the dragons.

Akatosh has given mortals throughout time the gift of Dragon Blood, and the first to give her soul into the Amulet of Kings, and there have been many others over the years, from Wulfharth the Underking to Tiber Septim himself, who became Talos and strengthened Convention.

And that's Akatosh

---

So where does this leave our messy conglomerate?

Auri-El is free. He escaped the Mundus thanks to the Marukhati Selectives. He now exists independently of Akatosh

Alduin is still in the oversoul, even though he is technically now Akatosh's First-born. He too exists independently of Akatosh, but his role is greatly diminished by his own choices. His brother-father-friend (that's the Lorkhan bit, friend) punished him by blessing one more mortal with the blood of the Dragon.

Shezzar is no more. Shor is untouched

Aka-Tusk exists as a concept. His oversoul still holds Akatosh, and though he is a part of the oversoul, he has supplanted Aka-Tusk. In this way, Aka-Tusk exists only as the oversoul, the link between all the aspects he once possessed.

Akatosh is Auri-El and Lorkhan mixed, and has become a replacement for his father. He is Alduin's younger brother, the Second-born, and Alduin is his First-born and brother. So yes, Thromgar Iron-Head, Alduin is not Akatosh. But he also is. And also never was. And also always was.

1359767966.0,17qa79,Addressing a few issues that popped up lately,xenoposeidon,105,11,23,"Hello

I am sure you are all aware of the changing state of the subreddit due to the sharp increase in popularity lately. I am also sure that many scholars see some issues that happen with this wave of popularity

First and foremost I'd like to talk a little about the difference between Gameplay and Lore. By now I hope that any new or old user seeking to contribute to the subreddit has read our subreddit rules. Two of our most important rules are

""Submissions must be lore-relevant and should not cross the line between lore and gameplay.""

and

""Comments must be relevant to lore. This rule does not apply within the Weekly Community Thread.""

These two single rules are what separates /r/teslore from any other TES-related subreddit, I'd like to talk more specifically about this part:

&gt; should not cross the line between lore and gameplay

This is a very important distinction. A comment or post relevant to lore is anything that **directly** talks about, or creates/disproves lore. Note the word direct, it is very important. Comments about gameplay that *relate* to lore in one way or another are  related to lore, yet not relevant. 

Lately we have seen some comments claiming something along the lines of: ""If I create this character and play him/her in the lore

This is not true. At all. Again

Relevant comment (in the context of an ingame character):

""Making your character an Orc would mean that, due to the fact that in the history of Tamriel Orsimer were disrespected and exiled by the other races.""

Irrelevant comment:

""If you are roleplaying an Orc

Note that the relevant comment had specific facts about and talked about Tamrielic history, had no facts whatsoever about lore, only about roleplaying and gameplay.

Note this idea does not only apply to gameplay, which is why you will see most of these comments removed. Same goes for roleplaying comments, comments such as responses to different comments with an in-character tone almost always have some relation to lore, and yet do not talk about lore directly in any way.

The only exceptions to this rule in normal threads are any comment that can be considered a scholarly response. Comments such as ""I extremely enjoyed this post

Alright, the long text is over soon.

One other issue I'd like to discuss is the issue of comments restricting discussion.

It is an issue we have soon semi-commonly this last year

Some scholars, what we are seeing is users claim that because one user has a better understanding of a subject than others, his/her contributions to the topic are the only ones that matter and any contradictions are immediately wrong. This is bad.

The most commonly we see this pattern is in threads asking about specific races or cultures. We in the subreddit have some very intellectual and determined scholars that have risen up as ""experts"" about specific cultures, Mr_Flippers, Lebiro, and myself. When a question or post regarding a specific race or culture pops up, we almost always see comments claiming or suggesting that without the response or consent of the specific users named above (and others like them), all other comments or theories are invalid. We, the moderators

The reason we dislike these comments is because they restrict discussion. /r/teslore is a subreddit dedicated to discussing and debating certain subjects, ""If you have a question about sload, just wait for /u/Sload_MasterxX to arrive, he knows the most about Sload"", it is immediately suggested that any other comment in that thread except the comment made by /u/Sload_MasterxX is either wrong or does not contain enough information. And when that is assumed, these comments are not responded to and so discussion is canceled.

I hope you are understand what I'm getting at here. I'm sure all us ""Subject Experts"" are honored by your respect

So, as well as try to promote discussion instead of restricting or monopolizing it.

That is all

**In Love with Evil**

The answer lies in the general philosophy of Daedra worship, to cut yourself into better shapes.  The Sword is Discipline, self-improvement, slicing the fat from the lean.

How does Daedra worship contribute to this?  Vivec knew, you can learn how to remain unharmed.

Let's talk about [Dark Souls](http://www.preparetodie.com/) for a second.  Don't let that segue give you whiplash.

**Discipline**

You've fought hard to a new boss and the moment you step into the room it swings a sword and kills you dead.  Instead of giving up, and you get killed repeatedly until you figure out how to survive in that demon's presence.  Perhaps you seek the council of others who have come before you, and they help as they can.  By the time you've killed it, you're leaner for the learning.

This is what is meant by the concept of being ""cut"" into better shapes.  The cutting is painful, you exercise.  The exercise is painful, but the effort is worth the work.  Nothing easy is worth doing.  All worthwhile self-improvement is going to involve pain.  Life is pain.  Anyone who says differently is selling something.

Daedra worship is very similar.  To understand how the Dunmer choose to worship their Daedric Lords

Is your neck okay?  Maybe you should sit down.

**Dominance and Submission**

One of the more difficult concepts to grasp in Bondage/Domination/Sado-Masochism is also the most obvious: why would anyone voluntarily put themselves through torture?  The answer is in the Dominant / Submissive (Dom &amp; Sub) relationship

A Submissive is subjected to discipline by the Dominant.  All kinds of horrible things can and will happen.  But when things go too far

The person who is truly in control of the situation is the Submissive

The Dunmer are the Subs.  They submit themselves to the dangers and torture of the Daedra

Of course, DAGON, MALAC, SHEOG.  [The Four Corners](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:House_of_Troubles) are considered ""Trouble"" because (among other reasons) they're far too selfish, crazy, destructive, or irresponsible to respect the Dom / Sub relationship.  You've got to be a particular brand of awesome to submit to the will of those four.

[In the 36 Lessons](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:36_Lessons_of_Vivec

""The last time I heard his voice, I dared to take on the sacred fire and realized there was no equilibrium with the ET'ADA. They were liars, lost roots, and the most I can do is to be an interpreter into the rational.""

Vivec submitted to Molag Bal's dominance (I could argue that he is the most domineering of the Daedra)  and learned to control himself.  He became more disciplined by allowing himself to be disciplined, but at a huge risk, and Vivec was only able to survive that encounter because he had already attained a considerable measure of Mastery.  Among the numerous lessons here: Don't submit to a dominant force you can't control.

Remember what we discussed in the previous section: Discipline is the act of being cut into a better shape.  It is a painful transformation

**Why Didn't Vivec Become an Amaranth?**

So why

The answer is [Love](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/18gt8w/what_is_love/), and the traditional affectionate kind.

Vivec says ""I denounce the alienation of the Cloven Duality with a hammer, and as such are part of the trap that keeps Mortals from attaining Divinity.  But he also calls them ""The Key and the Lock,"" because the worshipping of Daedra contains the key to freedom from the prison of Mortality: discipline, and the knowledge and ability that comes from it.

By testing themselves against the Daedra

But if Vivec became an Amaranth, but that would be a temporary paradise, because his people had not become enlightened, as he had.

Vivec knew that everyone must attain CHIM.  Everyone must endure the torture of discipline until they can become as enlightened as he.  This is the process for which Lorkhan created Mundus: not just the evolution of Mortal into Divinity

All of Mundus must become Divine.  Love must be done.  Love requires discipline, he did not become the Easy Way Out, because to do so would have meant cursing all Mortals to a life of death and blindness.  They would have grown soft, complacent, bitter, angry, rebellious.  That is not enlightenment.  It's not bliss.  It's a curse far truer than anything the Aedra could ever design.

Instead he became the Anticipation of Mephala

This is the theme that flows in the undercurrents of the Dunmer culture.  They are in love with evil.  And this seems to other TES cultures to be an evil act in itself, who act the way they do because they are incapable of doing otherwise.

Maybe this reminds you of other Dark Elf cultures in [other games

**Beyond Elder Scrolls**

Part of the magnificence of Morrowind's contribution to our culture is its philosophy.  That

But this concept of the Dunmer religion is useful in real life.  The idea of embracing Evil, ability, mastery, learning.

Taking a new

Want to lose ten pounds?  Get abs like a Greek statue?  Time to put yourself through a more intense physical routine.  It's going to hurt.  And you'll love it.

Is your life kicking you in the throat?  Things seem hard

When I told him about the lowest point in my life

This was Vivec's realization, to make us harder, better, faster, stronger.  To ""rescue"" mortality from that prison before it had done its work would have been a punishment, not a reward.

By Fralvia Varo


When one thinks of glass


In truth, glass refers to two different materials: raw glass from the province of Morrowind, and malachite from the Northern and Southern extremities of Tamriel.


These materials are both very strong, and is much more valuable. It appears in Morrowind, erupting from the ground in clusters of translucent green shards. Malachite is mined from ore veins, and can be found in Skyrim, High Rock and Alinor. It is much darker in color, but is lighter in terms of weight.


To begin with, few have been able to travel to the island of Vvardenfell, so the supplies of glass have dried up.


That isn't to say that it was readily available to all prior to the disaster. In the late years of the Third Era, making glass and ebony smuggling a dangerous, but lucrative trade. Glass in particular was seen as more valuable, as it weighed much less than ebony, but could be sold for a similar price. Those who were weighed down by stolen ebony would have to abandon their gains in order to escape.


For the most part, and several times more awe-inspiring. The armor is capable of absorbing impacts, but is less durable than ebony. As for bladed weapons, they could be made absurdly sharp, but would be quick to dull. They would have to be repaired frequently to retain their usefulness.


Raw glass is also of use to alchemists. A piece of glass, strength, or speed. If used correctly, it could also make for a potent fire shield potion.


As the East Empire Company answered to the Emperor, the design of which was received negatively by some. A nobleman, who had commissioned several sets, was outraged when he saw the final product and, after leaving the Imperial City, left them lying on the road. It was said that the pieces were then appropriated by bandits.


Malachite is the second material that can be used to create sturdy glass


Malachite must be mined and then refined. The Altmer are able to create strong weapons and armor with a few ingots. Most malachite creations in the land of Skyrim are of Altmer origin, being an important symbol to the Altmer.


Malachite equipment is much more durable than armor made from raw glass


Alchemists of the third era were known to use malachite for its silencing properties


While both raw glass and malachite are very different, fire salts turn it red and void salts turn it into a dark grey shade.


However due to the events of the 4E 5, it is actually malachite that they are talking about. While it has been many years since the eruption of Red Mountain, the volcano is still billowing ash, and shows no signs of stopping. If glass miners are unable to return to Vvardenfell, it seems that in the future, glass will come to refer exclusively to malachite.",,,,

1338580004.0,ug3c1,A note on Imperial names.,lebiro,93,8,38,"Okay, for characters with nothing better to say)

If we look at the names of all the Imperials in Oblivion (I'm ignoring the other games for simplicity's sake

On the one hand, you have names like ""Amantius Allectus"" and ""Julitta Plotius"". To me, it seems that the former, with harsher sounds, and an abundance of ""k""s, ""v""s and ""j""s are Colovian names, whereas the Latinesque names are Nibenean. This would fit the rugged Colovians vs smooth Nibeneans idea

Taking a look, but a somewhat Colovian beginning (with the ""Ch"" sound being present in the Colovian ""Chorrol""), suggesting, perhaps, a slight Nibeneanisation, but ""Valga"" is guttural and harsh. On the other hand is Regulus Terrentius, Count of the Nibenean Bravil. Here, all is Latin.

Another useful example is Hackdirt. This is a small Colovian town, ""Marlena Brussiner"", ""Natch Pinder"" (note also that ""Pinder"" is the name of a historical hero of Kvatch), ""Vlanhonder Moslin"". it's all guttural, harsh sounds.

There are exceptions to this, but I would have to guess at Colovian, since I can't imagine a Nibenean ruler of Skingrad (read ""Rislav the Righteous""). This said, ""Janus"" is very Nibenean, so I would suggest a fashion for Nibenean first names among the nobility (see also Arrianna Valga and aforemention Charus). It just seems to me that the clear distinction between names like ""Kastav"", ""Irlav"" and ""Berich"" and ""Arentus"", ""Gemellus"" and ""Herminia"" must have an explanation.

Maybe I've overthought this, so I've just poured my thoughts out here.

P.S. Also, but ""Goldwine"" does not fit either format at all. Imperials do not have descriptive (English) names like this. My theory here is that the Goldwines are of Breton descent (Ordevin or Vindor in ~~French~~ Breton). Just an aside.",,False,,t5_2t5ay,1338582129.0,Mages,

1361854716.0,198q3r,"Rieklings: A Tiny Civilization, Unmasked.",Lorfiend,89,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/198q3r/rieklings_a_tiny_civilization_unmasked/

Rieklings, Crassus Lanius, (author of ""The Thousand-and-One uses for Horkers: A Primer"") set out to investigate these mysterious beings on their home island. What follows are my findings.

* **Architecture**-

Rieklings have a simplistic architecture, Deer, Skeevers, and more. The huts, generally rounded with an entrance protruding from one side have loose fitting roofs and are only attached to the ground with bone or wood stakes, giving the impression that they can be easily disassembled and moved, should the need arise. Which would insinuate a mostly nomadic culture

* **Religion**-

Riekling religion is a complicated thing and not much is known to us, native to Morrowind and Solstheim. Scathecraw is dreadfully toxic, so much of the ritual, including how the Rieklings survive it, remains a mystery to us. Popular theory has it that the Rieklings are simply immune to the airborne variants of the Scathecraw toxins, while another theory argues that part of the Riekling godspeak ritual involves a potion which keeps them safe from the toxin. Regardless, more study is required.

Rieklings have no known religious figures, witches, or medicine men that can be found in other savage cultures like Orcs, and Goblins. When Rieklings wish to preform the godspeak ritual, they simply gather round a fire, burn the Scathecraw and chant in unison, there is no leader.

Who the Rieklings speak to and worship in the godspeak ritual is another topic of much debate, Daedric god of the Hunt, given his history on Solstheim and the Rieklings' hunter-gatherer culture. The other choice would be the All-Maker of the Skaal religion, seeing as the two share an island heavily influenced with shrines of this ""All-Maker"" and the Rieklings have a habit of adopting the cultures and items of those they live close to (see culture). Another theory has presented itself that Rieklings may worship the Orcish Daedra-God, Malaclath. I find these theories to be highly preposterous, as Rieklings live so isolated from his other followers, and so deep in the influence of many other gods and Daedra.

* **Culture**

Rieklings live in tribal villages or groups of 10-50 Rieklings, Worker, Boar Breeder) and one leading Chief of the tribe. The chief chooses the days on which godspeak rituals will occur, and leads the Rieklings in whatever endeavors they may be preforming (a hunt, a raid, construction). Rieklings are highly social creatures, who communicate often and quite loudly in their guttural language consisting of clicks of grunts. There are recorded instances of intelligent Rieklings using Tamrielic to communicate with travelers and locals who encounter them.

Riekling leaders are chosen in a way that can be called similar to the way that Orcs choose their chieftains. If and when a Riekling wants to become chieftain, if victorious, becomes the new chief, this way only the strongest rule. There have been extreme and highly unusual and rare scenarios where a non-Riekling can become a chieftain of a Riekling tribe, recorded incidents of this are often ridiculously overexagerrated, but truth can still be found in some. 

Rieklings raise and domesticate Bristleback Boar, to agriculture, where they are used for meat, to architecture and clothing, where they are used in Riekling huts and armors. 

Riekling clothes and armors are primarily made of bones and furs from the creatures they raise and hunt, as the practice of creating such armor has fallen out of, well practice, sometime after the late Third Era. Despite the cold climate of Riekling dwellings in northern Solstheim, Rieklings often only cover about half their bodies in furs and bones, leaving much of their chest, stomach

Rieklings have a very simple, jabbed from up close, or used like a lance while mounted on a Bristleback Boar. Rieklings have also been known to use arrows fashioned by more intelligent races as spears, much to the same effect.

Most notably in Riekling society, random, generally useless items from the newer Dunmer settlements on Solstheim, tools and animal skins from the northern Skaal, and even scraps of metal from Dwemer ruins. The purpose of this hoarding is as of yet unknown, yet the use of these stolen items in shrines insinuates a religious connotation.

* **Biology**-

Reikling Biology is indeed fascinating, and other scholars don't care to know. However, a lot can be inferred from just observing Rieklings from a bush outside one of their camps. 

The heart of a Riekling is a powerful thing, despite their small size.

Most interestingly is the sickening crunching noise a Riekling makes between minutes and hours after dying. This writer's best guess is that it has something to do with the cold of the snow, or a combination of the three flash-freezing the Riekling's previously hot bones (no doubt so hot from the Rieklings hot blood, being pumped from their immensely powerful hearts). Now, if you've ever dropped a scorching hot rock into water, you've no doubt seen as the rock cracks and sometimes even explodes. I believe that Riekling bones may behave somewhat in the same way; when a Riekling dies, their bones chill very quickly and crack, shatter, creating the noise.

1375245969.0,1jeh7i,Khajiiti warfare,Mr_Flippers,91,9,15,"I've seen this a bit lately

Firstly, if one form cannot do it then another can and as we've seen in previous threads, Khajiit are very community-minded. Likewise, this is seen in their tactics. Khajiit see advantage in any way and they'll take it. Using the best and almost only source we have, Mixed Unit Tactics talks about the cooperation between the sub-species. Mixed units being the trump card for Khajiit in battle, where most races favour a particular form of warfare Khajiit can perform all of them well.

One thing that is shared amongst all Khajiit, you can bet he'd kick him in the nads and run away. Fighting dirty is just fighting for survival and they will run away if they have to, no point in fighting just so your corpse gets praised (however, there are martyrs in Khajiit society, Ri'sallidad). But, Khajiit are all different types all fighting together and in different cultures, so we have to look at these factors too. Culturally first

**Anequina**:

""Barbaric"" to the Pelletines (pelletinians, particularly in and around the towns by the Ne' Quin al desert. The conventional combat sub-species would be favorable here and their ""talents"" more suited for this culture. An Anequinine Senche-Raht would be one hell of a force to be reckoned with.

**Pelletine**:

Considered ""decadent"" by the Anequinine Khajiit, mobile soldiers.

That covering as little as it did

**Alfiq**: Very powerful mages and the most magically adept sub-species. This, so these guys aren't exactly going to be frontline infantry. Alfiq-Raht would likely be the same case, but bigger in size.

**Cathay**: the subspecies considered to ""make good warriors"" (from Morrowind dialogue) likely due to their size and bipedalism making them able to adapt to using both typical weapons and their own claws. I'd estimate that their size would make the typical Cathay about 1 foot taller than a regular Altmer and Cathay-Raht probably being 2-4 feet taller than Altmer

**Suthay**: from the same dialogue, they'd be much more suited to guerrilla, hit and run tactics due to their stature and affinity for stealth. Suthay-Raht are the sub-species that players in Morrowind, Oblivion and Skyrim can be. Martial arts would likely be their strong suit and there's plenty of forms for them to learn (and with claws, they really can do some nasty stuff).

**Tojay**: pretty much nothing is known about these guys

**Pahmar**: said to be similar to a tiger. I'd say they would be both strong and agile fighters, is likely just a bigger version.

**Senche**: the big boys, as the Tale of Dro'Zira informs us that Sabre Cats of Skyrim were formerly Senche that had turned smaller into what they are now (and no, Sabre Cats are not Khajiit). I don't think I have to explain how useful these guys are in a fight.

**Dagi**: as we can see from Mixed Unit Tactics, tree-dwelling and useful with bows AND magic. Probably as guerrilla as it gets for the Khajiit. However, they're also limited by the fact that they wouldn't be very useful outside of forests and jungles due to one of their best natural talents becomes pointless when there's no trees around. Dagi or Dagi-Raht are probably half the size of a Suthay-Raht (again, just estimation). They're also talented mages and supposedly take advantage of this whilst they're in battle.

**Ohmes**: probably the most suited to traditional warfare with archery or as another kind of light soldier due to their size and Bosmer-like appearance. Probably very useful in an intelligence role due to their appearance and agility; but also more likely used for traditional warfare that Imperials and other man races are more likely to use

**Ohmes-Raht**: quite different from Ohmes

Now for some special things

Martial arts in Elsweyr is in no short supply, Sand, Wind, Sun, Storm, and Two-Moons-Dance. The martial arts themselves are described to be ""of claw and tail"", again playing to the natural advantages Khajiit have, monks have even been said to be some of Elsweyr's greatest warriors when they need to be.

There are still more sub-species of Khajiit that we know *nothing* about. The PGE claims there to be ""over twenty"" and an old MK comment stated there to be 24. But again, or anything really.

Khajiit armour use is overall still obscured to us. We've heard that they typically use medium armour, we do know that they have little regard for heavy armour.

The best reason that economic historians have for it is something that they call the Malthusian Trap. This ""Trap"" is a multi-step process.

First, bringing it back to the level it was before. 

For a better treatment of this see: Structure and Change in Economic History by Douglass North. Also

As a result


When put in that context, but along with that population comes a greater demand for food and more disease and pretty soon they were back where they started. That's assuming the technology/magic is not lost, which as we've seen is not an uncommon occurrence in the Elder Scrolls saga.

Tamriel is a very violent place. The Great War ended just recently, and the such. Diseases like Brainrot will also be spread more easily from Mudcrabs and Skeevers into the cities.

1348597974.0,10go5y,The Renaissance that Never was: Or How Azura Destroyed the Enlightenment,thinkpadius,91,6,58,"**EDIT 3:** Thank you all for your comments and criticisms

**EDIT 4:** What is outlined below is a theory that Azura destroyed the Dwemer


**EDIT 1:** Why Would Azura Try to Prevent and Undo a Renaissance?

From the book ""Azura and the Box"" we learn that Azura was tricked by the Dwemer. The Dwemer trick revealed that the Daedric princes aren't omniscient

---
**Below is my understanding of the Dwemer Renaissance:**

* It is the time of the Dwemer, all that is going to come to an end by the hands of Azura.

* Dwemer power is centered on the amalgam of magic and science.  They examine the stars and they explore the earth.

* Their creations are both beautiful and perfect for both form and function.  Their architecture is unique.

* Their people are famous: Namely Kagrenac and his understanding of Lorkhan's heart has survived through history.

* Their exploration of both sky and earth leads them to the understanding of the heart of a god. It is a pinnacle of mortal understanding and they quickly begin work to learn how to tap its power to achieve an immortality of their own.

* Dwemer magic becomes so advanced they extract one of the tones of Padomay

The Dwemer are possibly the beginning of Tamriel's ultimate change from magic and agriculture to magic and industry.  Despite their aims

But

---

**EDIT 2:** There are four distinct seasons of Morrowind history: Nerevar, and Nerevarine.  Morrowind's renaissance existed during the time of Nerevar, continued under the Tribunal at the height of its power and even during the early years of Dagoth Ur's rise. At the time of the Nereverine, as many of you commented, the Tribunal's influence was already severely restricted by Dagoth Ur.

**EDIT 5:** So why would Azura want to devastate the Tribunal and destroy the Heart of Lorkhan? The answer is simple: The Tribunal are three self made gods

**Below is my interpretation of the Morrowind and (implied) Imperial Renaissance:**

* It's a time of overall peace and Morrowind is protected by Vivec and the Tribunal.  It's a time when the competition between the Great Houses has created wealth and spread knowledge.  It is a time when the Cyrodilic empire is unified and its peace with Morrowind appears beneficial to both powers.  Azura waits

* There are great men such as Dyvath Fyr - an immensely old wizard and renaissance man.  There are scientists of the past such as Louis Beauchamp - who unfortunately had trouble with a crashed airship. These are just ones I've seen in-game

* Leaders of the Great Houses have developed successful diplomatic ways to compete in a fairly non-violent way.

* Magical knowledge appears to be the strongest it's ever been - great spells have been formed by combining different spell types.  The tonal knowledge of Kagrenac is partially gone

* Weapons enchantments are powerful

* People can walk on water and fly.

**EDIT 6:** Dagoth Ur rises and taps the Heart of Lorkhan to become a god in his own right.  The Tribunal is prevented from accessing the Heart

But this all ends when Azura intervenes by convincing the Nerevarine that the Tribunal killed Nerevar to steal power. This is reinforced by Vivec's honesty and admittance that there are two stories of the events at Red Mountain. He generously allows the Nerevarine to decide for himself which events were true.  Unlike Azura

Regardles

The Nerevarine could have worked with the Tribunal to stop Dagoth Ur and separate him from the Heart while they restored their power. The stalemate could have continued or Dagoth could have weakened in the same way that the Tribunal could have! Oblivion knows that the Daedra have reached their own stalemates!

The Nerevarine destroys the Heart of Lorkhan and Dagoth Ur.  It ushers in the eventual destruction of Vvardenfall

The Nerevarine was a pawn to destroy the enlightenment of the mortal races. **EDIT 6 ENDS**

---

**Below is my interpretation of the beginning of the Cyrodelian Middle Ages.**

The Septim Bloodline produced some good and bad emperors.  But under the Septims

* The Oblivion Crisis was a second assault on whatever was left of Tamriel's enlightenment and doomed the Cyrodilic Empire.  Mehrunes Dagon

* The process destroyed towns and killed thousands.

* Magic, while many recipe and spell combinations became lost knowledge.  People could no longer fly.

* Were there any renaissance men/women during this time?

Thus the empire became incredibly weak.  Azura returns to her benign and kindly self as she watches Cyrodil burn.

----

**Below is my understanding of the continued decline of the Imperial and Nordic middle ages.**

Now we reach the time of Skyrim, powerful and immortal enemies have returned to destroy the world.

* The mage guild is gone.  The sole bastion of magic in Skyrim is the mages college, they celebrate their hardiness, violence and honor above their intellect, magical prowess and civility.

* There are few great renaissance men

* Diplomacy has degraded.  The *real* renaissance formalized types of Diplomacy

* Regardless of any success or failures by the empire or the stormcloaks

* Dragons are destroying towns

* Magic is limited to even fewer spells

And that leaves us with another look at Azura again. She stands benignly seeking only to restore *Azura's Star* a soul stealing artifact.

----

And so there we have it; the end of what little renaissance there could have been. Begun by Azura against the Dwemer and then against the Tribunal and Morrowind and continued by those who took advantage of weakened mortals.

* Does Tamriel face a dark age soon?

* Is magic's power declining?

* What will mortals face in the future?

* What will Azura do next?

1357461958.0,161yk6,"The Elder Way, Hist Genetics, and Argonian reincarnation.",xenoposeidon,94,47

The simplest way a common Argonian would explain to an Imperial interviewer as to what happens to an Argonian after death is that they are rejoined with the Hist and reincarnated into a new body. This has some truth in it, one has to first understand Hist-altering, A.K.A the Elder Way.
In Lord of Souls, faster, and more intelligent when they needed the Argonians to be extra-efficient soldiers in the Oblivion Crisis. Glim specifically states that ““A few twelves of years ago, our country was invaded from Oblivion. The Hist knew it was going to happen, and called our people back to Black Marsh. Many of us were altered, made ready for the war that we had to fight. Made stronger, faster—able to endure terrible things. ...”
We also know that Hist Sap can also alter the Argonian physical state

And finally we know Hist can alter themselves. The Lilmoth tree is described as gigantic and overreaching, and why not themselves? It seems only reasonable a Hist whose purpose is to give political advice would look fearsome and powerful, and that another who is cut away from its brothers would be frail and small. Another theory I have come up with is that Falinesti is in fact a Hist that has disconnected from the Hivemind, i.e gone “Rogue” in order to adapt for a changing environment and culture, and thus grew ways to move around and be favorable for the populace of Bosmer. 

Contrary to what one may think, and had plenty of time to develop their ways. This technic is so old and complex a simple human or mer mind could not comprehend it, only a super advanced one, such as the mind of a Psijic monk.  

From [On Arteaum]( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Daggerfall:Fragment:_On_Artaeum) we know that the first beings on Tamriel (The Hist) taught the Psijics the Elder Way

I myself have a very limited understanding of Genetics, the Elder Way is based on something I can only identify as the Elder Scrolls counterpart of DNA or the genetic composition of different living things. In simplicity, the Elder Way is really a fancy term for purposeful mutation. If a Hist such as the Lilmoth tree wants to look more fearsome and gigantic, it simply has to use its hyper-intelligence to think its nucleotide sequence into changing around, composing a new sequence that would allow for the genomes to develop differently, and the result would be a larger Hist. There you have it, I just terribly explained mutation. Anyways the same works for Hist Sap ingestion. 
Think of the Hist and Argonians as computers and sap as a flash drive. The Hist set a certain blueprint for Elder Way Mutation in the sap, and the sap is then taken and willfully ingested by the young Argonian. Then this data is transferred, and the sap runs the data like a program, mutating the Argonian. The more sap is ingested, the more data can be transferred and the program or mutation can run more effectively.
The reason ingestion has to be done over and over again and that Argonians are not born like their parents is because Argonians are unable to ejaculate part of the sap to their egg spawns and thus transfer the program nor can they themselves alter the child because they cannot comprehend the Elder Way.

The neat thing is that through seeing that the Hist were able to mutate Argonians from afar at the time of the Oblivion Crisis we can see that the Hist can actually transmit data to the Sap from far away. Think of this kind of like Elder Way mutation internet or cloud data. From this we can hypothesize on what happens when argonians die.

Let’s get an example going. Say we have an Argonian, the sap took control of his body and used the Elder Way to turn him into a nice, tall, handsome young Argonian. Now let’s say Mr. Jeelus grows up and works with the East Empire Company, and on one of his trips suddenly falls overboard from his ship and gets eaten by a Sea Drake. Once the jaws of death sink on him and his brain stops functioning, the sap mutation program realizes the Argonian died, and thus gathers all the info on how to mutate an Argonian to look and be as strong as Jeelus, you guessed it, Jeelus’s egg mate

Since this process is so successful, which is also why many Argonians have a belief in Sithis. Sadly, though, it is not Sithis that causes the reincarnation but rather the manipulative Hist.

I hope that was not too complex. I tried to do it in ELI5 format, so keep your eyes out for new ones.

That is all. See you tomorrow in the Community Thread.

1351608804.0,12c8kv,"Of Blades, myths, and prophecy",,89,39, October 30th, 4E 171

To start, the need for their services declined. They cemented themselves into Tamriel's history by becoming the protectors and sworn agents of Reman Cyrodiil, who was Dragonborn. Reman, as you all know, founded the Second Cyrodiilic Empire. He halted the invasion of Tamriel by combined forces of Tscaesci and the Men of Akavir by defeating them dramatically at Pale Pass. Historically, we're told that the Men of Akavir, the Dragonguard in particular, apologizing profusely and telling him that they were looking for him. It's implied that his Thu'um quelled the invading forces

However, we are also told, are immortal, vampiric Serpent-Men. If taken literally, the Dragonguard survived due to the service they rendered to the nobility of the Snakemen (which I'll be using from now on because it's easier to type), but I doubt that a literal interpretation is necessary at all. Much of Akavir is told to us in mythic and allegorical terms, which prompts a closer examination of the facts. I promise we'll get to the Blades again soon, there wouldn't be any reports of them being on Tamriel, or the term ""ate"" is allegorical

Now then, at least until close to the end of the First Era, were pure-blood Akaviri settlements. Whether or not that means only the men or only the Snakemen, or a mixture of the two was present, but I find it hard to believe that the race of Men from Akavir was completely wiped out, at least globally. The biggest example of that is, in fact, and they left their mark on Tamriel quite notably. Sky Haven, Cloud Ruler Temple are all wonderful examples of the Dragonguard's Akaviri origins. So, laying the groundwork for the systems of spies and secrets that the Blades would eventually employ to great effect.

Now that that history lesson is over with, since we have record of the Dragonguard's annals from Sky Haven dating to [2E 568](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/annals-dragonguard). In any event, at some point during the Second Era, the Dragonguard became the Blades. It likely had some relation to the formation of the Fighters Guild, since some Akaviri from the Dragonguard would likely have been recruited for the initially-Akaviri-only group, though it could simply have been Tiber Septim reestablishing an order to protect him after losing his Thu'um. The history of the order descends into the murky depths for about six hundred years, then reemerges as the Blades in the Third Era.

The Blades under Tiber Septim were his finest soldiers, when the events of *Daggerfall* take place. As fighters, the were easily distinguished by their ceremonial armor of heavy steel, in traditional Akaviri Dragonguard style, complete with their curved longswords. Their training style is brutal, intense, and very efficient; on-edge sparring is the name of the game, as evidenced by their interactions with each other in both *Oblivion* and *Skyrim*. Their network of spies and agents is vast, stretching to every corner of Tamriel. These agents were of every race. They were merchants, and warriors

In fact, and sent their agents, both knowingly, and unknowingly in the case of the Nerevarine, in to make decisive actions to save parts of, or the whole of the Empire. The worked alongside the Champion of Cyrodiil during the Oblivion Crisis, though a bit less willingly, they failed in their primary mission, something that hadn't happened since the end of the First Era. In fact, at the end of the Third Era

By the time the Fourth Era rolled around, but an ancient enemy would soon rear its head up. As protectors of the Empire, they warred with the first Aldmeri Dominion as the Dragonguard, and the coming of the second signaled trouble. The Blades were the first to identify the nature of the threat the Thalmor posed, and it's fair to say that their efforts through the years leading up to the Great War may have saved the Empire from utter destruction in the initial strikes. However, those moves came at a heavy price. Most, if not all, in the year 171 of the Fourth Era. From then on, or buried by the Blades in an attempt to keep their secrets safe from the Thalmor

The last few Blades we know of made it out of the Imperial Province, for the White-Gold Concordat gave them the power to do so. Of the pre-War Blades, only two are confirmed to be alive, and [one other](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Fultheim) who may or may not be a Blade in hiding. The Dragonborn, of course, has the option of rebuilding, or at least

So now, ironically, means we need to go back into their past.

An ancient Akaviri prophecy (some attribute it to an Elder Scroll, and this prophecy that bade them to pledge their loyalty to all Dragonborn through Reman I. It was this prophecy in particular they chose to set in stone in Sky Haven Temple, sealed behind a Blood Seal only one with Dovah Sos could open. I'm fairly sure you all know it, but it is quite fun to say, so forgive me for posting it again:

""When misrule takes its place at the eight corners of the world

When the Brass Tower walks and Time is reshaped

When the thrice-blessed fail and the Red Tower trembles

When the Dragonborn Ruler loses his throne

When the Snow Tower lies sundered

The World-Eater wakes

The Dragonguard was so moved by this prophecy that they sought out the one called Dragonborn, then, that their mission prompted Delphine to reveal herself to the Dovahkiin, or that she and Esbern helped the Dovahkiin. Neither, considering their origins, is it surprising that Delphine and Esbern asked the Dovahkiin to kill Paarthurnax. But what does the future hold? After all, Alduin was defeated and sent, out of existence to await his rebirth at the end of the kalpa.

Let's start with the simple things. The Blades were staunchly opposed to the Thalmor before the events of *Skyrim*. Now, that is. They will likely be key players in future installments of the main series, perhaps sparking rebellions, perhaps openly fighting in a second Great War. They will, presumably, guard the Dovahkiin until he/she dies, at which time they can decide on a new purpose, and their ancestors' mission is finally complete. The future of the Blades is wide open, now that the Penitus Oculatus has taken their place. With Delphine as the acting Grandmaster of the Blades

So, and the loses they suffered for the good of Tamriel, Nirn, and all mortal-kind. After all, they were not hunting, but were looking for the One to stand against the World-Eater. Theirs is a deep and storied past, bound up in prophecy and legend, but when you look at the legacy of the Blades, of us want to see very desperately. Hopefully this will give you a better appreciation of the role the Blades play as you play through the Elder Scrolls games. It is quite a different experience,False

*By Harman Maurus*

**Introduction**

From the central province of Cyrodiil, over the shimmering Strid and into the vast expanse of green. From here you see the south-western province of Valenwood, tumbling southwards under a covering of lush vegetation. It is from here I cast my stone.

**“The Wild Remain”: Valenwood**

When the Imperial Geographical Society published the first Pocket Guide to the Empire in 2E 864, and while the rampant racism and misinformation that characterised the first publication had been shed by the publication of the third Guide in 3E 432, Valenwood was described under the title above.

This somewhat dismissive description, is demonstrative of the attitudes that have left Valenwood so neglected as an area of study. However, it is perhaps a fair comment on one level. After all, respect for and protection of nature is the central tenet of the Bosmeri religion, and so they have no desire to change the beautiful face of Valenwood. 

The vast majority of the Bosmeri province is untamed and unspoiled. For the most part Valenwood is a sea of rolling hills, with dense jungles, airy woods, dark mangroves and swamps, and wide isolated plains. Throughout the province, a network of rivers and natural canals provide the main means of transporting goods and travels. Rather extensive roads and infrastructure were introduced to the forest by the first Aldmeri Dominion, but the Bosmer have neither the desire nor the ability to maintain these roads

Valenwood’s settlements are testament to the Bosmeri love for the unique and beautiful; no two are alike to the sympathetic eye. While it is perhaps most logical to construct them on the sunny banks of Valenwood’s many waterways, hidden places of the forest. For the most are small and unobtrusive – clanhouses or villages built from imported timber, loose stone, hide yurts, or sometimes magically-cultivated treehouses, sustained by the clan’s hunters and fishermer and by what trade comes through their corner of the forest. There are Bosmer towns and cities, however

Most famous is Falinesti, largest of Valenwood’s migratory graht-oaks reaching more than a mile into the sky. The settlement itself is, in the grand scheme of the tree’s existence, unobtrusive. A complex network of walkways and platforms connect the broad, twisting branches of the tree, dwellings constructed from living wood and moss, tanned hide and great animal bones. The most popular method of accessing the soaring boughs of Falinesti is by small platforms known as “lifts”, Imga or Orcs (of which there is a surprisingly large population in Valenwood

Once long ago, would migrate across Valenwood, spending the winters in the north of the province, and moving south for the summer. The great tree rooted itself in the winter of 3E 429, much to the shock of the Bosmer, and the rooting was the high point of a time of great upheaval in the province. Many hoped that the phenomenon would be temporary, that the tree would resume its migration in the next season, until it eventually became apparent that Falinesti was to remain stationary for the foreseeable future. 

The famous peculiarity of Falinesti should not be allowed to detract from the beauty and value of Valenwood’s other great cities, a monumental construction of once-white stone which the years have blended almost seamlessly into the surrounding vegetation. It rests in the centre of the sacred “clearing” (relative to the density of the surrounding trees) known as the Elden Grove, and has served as Valenwood’s capital under both Aldmeri Dominions. There is perhaps good reason for this: the ancient city is far more logical and efficient in its construction than any more “modern” Bosmeri city, exhibiting the strong, considered design of Aldmeri cities. It is also the major destination for migrants to the province, hosting large communities of Altmer and (traditionally) men.

On the edge of the Elden Grove lies the city of Silvenar, whether naturally or magically, but the flowering trees began to produce copious brilliant sap that over time hardened and crystallised into dazzling amber of a hundred colours. On a logistical level, Silvenar is the polar opposite of neighbouring Elden Root; its streets are a maze of petrified branches, petals and waves of sap that look almost as if they are still flowing. Its buildings are irregular bubbles and canopies of glistening sap, many of them rendered exceptionally beautiful by the shapes of the ancient trees. This city, while it has never been the province’s capital, for it is here that the Silvenar resides. The Silvenar is too complex a subject to be appended to this section, and this

Valenwood’s fourth great city is the port of Haven, Haven is nonetheless a sight to behold. The busiest port in the province, it is naturally filled with activity – merchants, travellers, pirates, fishermen and all manner of seafarer. If it were not for the trees, and the bizarre and uncommon Bosmeri shipyards


**Elves of Valenwood: The Bosmer**

The Bosmer, in all senses. For the most part, they live in simple obscurity, existing in harmony with the forest and without great regard for the politics, wars and intrigues so beloved by most of Tamriel’s inhabitants. 

The Bosmer are naturally well-equipped to thrive in Valenwood. The average male Bosmer standing a little shorter than a man at about five and a quarter feet, and possess an uncanny dexterity and nimbleness, making them excellent craftsmer, woodsmer and most famously, archers.

In their appearance, and having significantly less pronounced elven features – their faces wider, their cheekbones rounder, their brows lower. Common tradition (as well-supported by evidence as we may expect for such matters) has it that the early Bosmer were known for mingling with their Nedic neighbours, or “taking mannish wives” as the Altmer creation myth has it, and it is reasonable to assume that it is as a result of this intermixing that the Bosmer are so (comparatively) human in their appearance. 

In one respect, as with any race, a great variety of eye colours and shades, among the Bosmer the most common is pure black, with no visible whites or iris. This phenomenon occurs rarely in the Altmer, and more rarely still in the Dunmer, but in the Bosmer it is common and iconic, with theories ranging from Y’ffre’s gift to archers


**Y’ffre’s Favoured People: The Bosmeri religion**

Over the course of their time in Valenwood, the Trickster. Mara, Xarxes and Stendarr also remain in their respective roles as gods of  (broadly speaking) love, knowledge and mercy respectively. However, the Bosmer have shed several important gods and ancestor deities still revered by the Altmer; Magnus, Trinimac, Syrabane and Phynaster have all vanished completely from worship. In their place, perhaps unsurprising given the far more open society of the Bosmer. 

From Tamriel’s men the Bosmer have received Arkay, and Z’en, an aspect of Zenithar, is believed to have been brought to Valenwood by Kothringi sailors. Z’en was a god of agriculture for the Kothringi, but the Bosmer have little use for such a god, and so he has become a broader and more powerful god of toil and payment in kind. The God of Toil faded somewhat into obscurity after the Knahaten Flu, possibly due to the extinction of the Kothringi with whom his worshippers were often connected.

Perhaps most surprisingly, Jone and Jode, are central parts of the Khajiiti faith, largely due to the Lunar Lattice that governs their shape. How they came to appear in the Bosmeri pantheon is a mystery to modern scholars; some argue that the Bosmer pragmatically adopted the gods of their foes after one too many defeats, others believe the Bosmeri love of the natural world organically extended to include the moons, which of course exert a considerable influence on Mundus. In a similar vein, the Bandit God, who appears as a marginal trickster spirit in many religions, then, although of course in Bosmeri tales he is most often on the side of the beset Boiche.

This exchange of deities, that is the role of Y’ffre, the Forest God. In the Aldmeri faith, and most of its descendants, Y’ffre is a relatively minor god of the forest, song and the water, who taught birds to sing at the dawn of time. In the Imperial tradition, but thought of as one of the first Earthbones

The first mortals, never able to settle in their true forms. Y’ffre pitied the mortals and showed them their true shapes, making man always man, elf always elf, beast always beast, and plant always plant. Now that they had their proper shapes, mortals could begin to understand the world. 

For the Bosmer, secrets ranging from the beautiful songs of the forest, to the fearsome Wild Hunt. But this sharing of secrets was not given without payment in kind. Y’ffre loved the forest he had helped to create (and it loved him; legends say the very trees moved closer to hear his songs), and new that he, like all the gods, could not remain to protect it indefinitely. To this end he tasked the Bosmer, his favourite people and best students, and his sacred forest of Valenwood. In exchange he would make it their home forever

This mythical agreement is known as the Green Pact, and so many conflicting accounts exist. Generally speaking, however, the Bosmer are forbidden from harming any plant life, from the mightiest tree to the smallest weed. The felling of trees by anyone is a crime against the Bosmeri religion. 

One of Y’ffre’s most dangerous secrets was the Wild Hunt. He taught the Bosmer how to undo his first great work and return to the dawn time when elves were beasts and men and plants all at once. In times of great need – typically in case of invasion and war – groups of Bosmer may choose to carry out the ancient and highly secretive ritual to permanently transform themselves into primordial beasts. The Hunt typically manages to direct itself towards the enemy and throw itself against them with a fury rare in the most ferocious beasts. There is no way to undo this terrible transformation, the changed ones turn on each other, ripping each other apart in what is reportedly the most horrifying stage of the process. Those that survive go on to haunt the dark places of Valenwood as ageless monstrosities, the most famous examples being Willy the Bitten and King Dead-Wolf Deer.

The Bosmer are not proud of this ability, for when desperate measures must be taken to defend Valenwood and the Bosmer. Certainly the sacrifices are great.

The Meat Mandate, forbids the consumption of plant matter, even naturally fallen fruit, and, most shockingly to outsiders, obligates the Bosmer to consume in entirety any fallen enemy, with the help of only his or her family. The Bosmer then, but religiously cannibalistic; they will happily eat any natural being (although daedra and the undead appear to be exceptions to the Meat Mandate), that once again precise details are somewhat scarce. Certain cultural practices seem to suggest that the flesh of fallen foes (as well as parts generally considered inedible) may be kept, or even race. 

In the late Third Era, and this promise has since become ingrained in the Bosmeri faith. What exactly it means is completely unknown to Imperial scholars and even, it would appear, to the Bosmer themselves, but the Precursor’s teachings have presented the first significant shift in the Bosmeri religion since the adoption of Z’en in the First or Second Era.


**The Tree-Sap People: Bosmeri Society**

Understandably, fabric, paper, and countless other purposes, as well as the ability to cut down troublesome greenery to build or expand roads and settlements. The (in)famous Second Era scholar, Eric of Guis, scathingly described the Bosmer as “improvident”, wood with bone, even pipes can be filled with crushed insects and animal fats. 

The history of Bosmeri society has in some ways been a long list of innovations to follow the Green Pact, the Bosmer have little concern for their place in society or the wider world, preferring to live in simple harmony with the forest, carrying out their trade and enjoying their lives. To an extent, the Boiche consider themselves “liberated” and are prone to unbridled revelry and debauchery. One great difference between the Altmer and Bosmer is the willingness of the latter to intermingle, even interbreed, with men, and certainly most Bosmer will not deny the human streaks in their lineage.

This generally relaxed attitude extends into many areas of Bosmeri culture. In battle, and are infamous for desertion and poor discipline. For a time Bosmeri archers, the finest in Tamriel, were employed in the armies of Colovia, but they were too unreliable for the Cyrodiilic warlords, prone to vanishing into the nearest copse or brush when in danger.  For this reason, the Bosmer are often admonished by other cultures for being cowardly or underhand, “The One-Thousand Benefits of Hiding”.

Within Valenwood, and familial groups. Traditionally, it is to these that an individual Bosmer owes most pride and allegiance, and at various times tribes have gone to war with each other. Eplear was ever truly able to unify these disparate clans under one banner, and even this banner has lost much of its prestige without its original bearer. 

This familial and insular lifestyle means that most traditional Bosmeri settlements are small and isolated - sometimes no more than a single building. These settlements will be largely self-sufficient, or else from the riverboats which sail back and forth across the province. 

Bosmeri society is almost totally lacking in rigid structures or expectations, instead roaming the forest at random or engaging in whatever task catches their interest. For the most part, a wilderness Bosmer’s main daily task will be hunting for his clan or family, but there is always time for some creative pursuit, or even to simply lie in the forest. In the cities, of course, more defined roles are necessary in order to succeed. There Bosmer act as shopkeepers, “builders”, leatherworkers

Leather is essential for the Bosmer, as a result, become quite skilled in its manufacture and use, and so Bosmeri leather and leather products can fetch high prices in foreign markets. Bows and arrows are similarly paramount in Bosmeri culture. The Boiche are renowned for their archery, and even credited with the invention of the bow, and so it is perhaps understandable that Tamriel’s archers pay highly for Valenwood bows. The Green Pact means that Bosmeri bows and arrows are typically made from bone or chitin, but may also be crafted from imported wood.

The dextrous and imaginative elves have also shown themselves to be talented craftsmer. Their love of the beautiful and the unique produces a great many unique artefacts, pearls and beaks, talismans made from mages’ knucklebones, bone pipes and carvings, and innumerable others. 

Besides their hands, the Storyteller, and a patron of bards, and his people have a long tradition of poetry, song and performance. Epic poems like the Meh Ayleidion, the Mnoriad Pley Bar, the Dansir Goland and the Dirith Yalmillhiad are the milestones of Bosmeri culture, myths and legends of the Bosmer from the Merethic Era onwards. These works provide another interesting contrast with the Altmer, are sung

Outside of Valenwood, Altmer and Dunmer, the Bosmer are welcoming in the extreme, or were until the closure of Valenwood’s borders by the Dominion. Traditionally, it was not uncommon to see all manner of foreigners – men, mer, even Orcs – living alongside the Bosmer in their cities. The local beastfolk, Satyrs,False,

",1,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/14zif3/the_unburning_flames_proper_use_of_pyromancy/,"  It is often said, by those with little to no experience in the field, that destruction is the most brutish form of magical expression. These uniformed critics claim it to be without subtlety, nothing more than slanders stemming from either the superstitious fear of  primal forces present in the non-magical populace or coming  from the other magical schools’ self-indulgent elitism. The easiest way to show the error in these common conceptions of destruction magic is to examine the complexity, let us explore how adept pyromancers have developed the ability to use fire to injure and kill

This concept of the unburning flame may sound like nonsense, giving too little of one’s magicka reserves will cause the fire to fizzle out, while too much magicka can drive a mage quickly to exhaustion. With its need for nourishment met by the the magicka tether, the flame has neither an incentive to move beyond the area the mage intended or any inclination toward blackening and blistering.
 
While this may seem undesirable for someone looking to use fire as a weapon, enveloping a foe and heating their body past its ability to function (though this can be more difficult to achieve with the Dunmer, their innate threshold for heat tolerance being significantly higher). As for the force aspect of pyromancy, a genuine fireball (accomplished by sending concentrated fire out then dramatically increasing its magicka supply on impact) can produce a blast as crushing as a blow from the largest of war-hammers. 

With all the delicate focus required in this type of pyromancy, endangering not only the caster but the entire surrounding area. To bring forth a flame without properly limiting its desire to scorch will allow it to spread beyond its intended target, leading to a literal backfire upon the spellcaster. If the practitioners of the school of destruction were as deficient in restraint and judgment as they are so commonly discussed as being, the forests around every major magical community would be nothing but ashes and cinders. 
 
Though a pyromancer’s control of their flames is not exclusively for concerns of safety, or personal gain. When a mage so publicly defiles a living body with un-reigned fire, the grotesque spectacle can only serve to lower the repute of that mage and the association they represent, at worst gaining enemies looking for justifiable retribution. Those more interested in wealth than matters of honor still have reasons to hold back their flame, as the loot they covet on their victims would be unlikely to survive the ravages of indiscriminate fires. Even those as depraved as necromancers have reason to temper their attacks, as the damage of actually burning the body could destroy whatever usefulness that figure had. 


  It must be addressed that there are indeed mages who forgo the appropriate etiquette of pyromancy, either claimed by their own uncontrollable flames or dealt with through the intervention of those they have harmed. To judge the whole school of destruction off of the failures of these few would be akin to disparaging mages for the ruin wrought by a dragon’s fire. ",,False,,t5_2t5ay,False,Winterhold,

What is important is a rather interesting scavenger hunt you can go on in *Skyrim*. The eight most powerful Dragon Priests were granted enchanted masks to signify their position, where the masks of the eight highest-ranking priests were stored when not in use. But the monument held a greater secret than its rather mundane use suggests. When all eight masks are put into place, the monument opens up, revealing a ninth mask, the mask of the Dragon Cult's leader in Skyrim, named Konahrik. 

[Konahrik](http://images.uesp.net/a/a4/SR-item-Konahrik.jpg) is a golden mask similar in appearance to every Dragon Priest's mask, who made it, was the highest-ranking Priest in all the Dragon Cult, and likely would have been the right-hand human servant of Alduin himself. Alduin has a rather infamous line in *Skyrim* where he claims to be the son of Akatosh. However, we know now that Akatosh didn't come into being until many hundreds of years after Alduin was cast forward in time by the Tongues, which casts the statement of Alduin's parentage into an odd light.

Fortunately for us, says something that we can use to better interpret this statement. Paarthurnax calls their father ""Bormahu"", which means ""Father"" in Draconic. But Bormahu is both another name for a very different figure, and a reference to him in the wake of Akatosh's absorption of this individual's position. To find this figure, we have to jump into the murky legends of [The Seven Fights of the Aldudagga](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/seven-fights-aldudagga), specifically Fight Four. Over the course of this tale, Alduin speaks to a being known as the Aka-Tusk, aspect Ald

This Aka-Tusk makes the claim that Alduin came from him, Alduin should know Aka-Tusk as his father, and name him as such, but he calls *Akatosh* his father instead. Well, there is actually an explanation for this. To keep a very long and confusing story short, Akatosh's creation occurs during a Dragon Break. By its very nature, the Dragon Break is untime: the convergence of all possible timelines and kalpas into one existence, has been

What matters is this: Akatosh, and Aka-Tusk as the Father of the Dovah, which is retroactive to the point where he always has been those things. But there is a clear point in history where Akatosh was not (even though he is because untime) in existence, and where Aka-Tusk is the Father of the Dovah (and more properly told, the oversoul which contains the shed aspects Alduin and Auri-El). 

My realization was this: Alduin must have told the priest who made the mask Konahrik that his ""father"", and indeed the father of all dragonkind. The priest who made Konahrik, out of a probable mix of reverence and arrogance, made his mask with tusks to symbolize his position as head of the Dragon Cult, as Aka-Tusk was the head of all dragons. Even after Akatosh's creation by the Marukhati Selective, the mask Konahrik retains its shape, stored away safely in Bromjunaar Sanctuary. The mask is a silent testament, and that Aka-Tusk's place has been taken by Akatosh as the Father of the Dovah. It's also worth noting that Konahrik is hidden away in a specific fold of time. Perhaps it is the only bit of Time that still belongs to Auri-El

Astrid. I've never really gotten her in all the time I've spent in Skyrim. She just seemed so... different, betrayal occurs, you become Listener/head of the DB, etc., but there's always been something off to me.

I think I may have just understood why. This is all conjecture, so I'm going to consider it true until something better comes along.

Astrid truly seems to love her Family in the Dark Brotherhood. She would go as far as making a deal with a dangerous enemy of the Brotherhood to theoretically give them safety. Why does she betray you

I think it comes back to family, I think she and Anbjorn are unable to have children of their own. This could be for a number of reasons, from injury with either one, to impotence or barrenness, or perhaps werewolves aren't able to have children for some reason. She's already been cut off from her biological family through the murder of her uncle, so her not being able to have a family with Anbjorn may have unhinged her a little more than she was already.

Thus her dominating style of love. She's the type of older Sister who steps up and keeps her younger Siblings in line while her Mother is out. She may be hard on them, she loves her Siblings, and would give anything to keep them safe.

Astrid's been without a true Mother in the Family for so long that she, it pushes her further and further. She doesn't want to give up control, because she's headstrong, and, in her mind, she knows how to better care for her Family than the Night Mother does. She takes a drastic step, and ends up betraying you, because you represent a change in power and intelligences in the Family. You're the oldest Brother, over to the enemy

Only when things go badly does she recognize her mistake. She knows that, she goes to her Mother, begs for forgiveness, and to save the Family.

Chances are, when surely everyone knows it quite well? Here, I hope to make those and similar questions answered. I should note that all of this isn't entirely my work, but rather a gathering of many sources mixed with my own interpretations and concepts.

First, Vivec stresses the importance of love and why we should know it, but there's still not really anything to suggest what he means by it.

The other most famous example is, but for now I'll explain just what love is.

Love is as you know it (romantic, increasing in breadth and depth, so by the end you'll hopefully know what love Vehk talks about.

One kind of love is something we know well - lustfulness. It is among the most basic concepts of love, which contains the famous phrase ""AND HROL DID LOVE UNTO A HILLOCK"". Vivec's [fourteenth sermon](http://imperial-library.info/content/thirty-six-lessons-vivec-sermon-fourteen) tells the story of Vivec, after having much intercourse with Molag Bal, engaging in a violent orgy with the King of Rape and his demons, and presenting his ""spear"", Muatra.

Next is the kind of love best known to us. The completely non-sexual love that we feel for close friends or family; the love that can co-exist with the sexual form of love in a romantic partner. The love that a parent will unconditionally feel for their child, springs to your mind when thinking of the term.

Then there is self-love, perfections and faults - it's the unconditional and complete love of oneself. It is seen by many as the most important love, and it's certainly important in understanding the following forms of love.

Now we're getting closer to what Vehk was talking about. Next is the love of the world and all people. The feeling that one gets when they feel compassion for a complete stranger. The sorrow we feel for those in poverty and those worse-off. It is not unlike self-love in that it is unconditional and of everything that pertains to it's subject

The last form is what Vivec refers to. The love for *existence* - the love for the world in the past and forever into the future, and will exist. It is like the previous form of love, only this love refers to that of absolutely everything with the same level of altruism. This love recognizes suffering as necessary for us to learn as a people, and it will gladly endure that suffering with the knowledge that is furthers our purpose of existence. This is the love that Vehk had for the world. This is the love that he wanted us to know.

Vivec deliberately shows us all these kinds of love

The Loveletter warns us of the coming ""Landfall"", causing it to erupt, destroying much life on it and rendering it mostly uninhabitable. Vehk wrote in his thirty-third sermon; ""if the love of the people of this city for me ever disappear, so shall the power that holds back their destruction"". He is of course, referring to Baar Dau and his claim that it is held there by the Dunmer's love for him. Eventually, he disappeared, and the Dunmer no longer loved Vivec. As written

I believe that, and when they did not, there were consequences. It was his tough-love way of helping the world - just like I discussed in the last form of love. He made the world suffer so that they may learn, and reduce further suffering in the future. Because he loved the world.

This is why the Landfall is known by the same name. Both ""Landfalls"" occurred under the same conditions

So now that we understand that we must love in order to protect the world, is the significance of love that gives it this power?

Love is the reason for the creation of Mundus. Lorkhan knew love, knowing love allows you to work with the Mundus. Not knowing it will make you work against it.

In [sermon three](http://imperial-library.info/content/thirty-six-lessons-vivec-sermon-three), despite their best efforts, they could not open it. Vehk spoke from within the egg:

""*Love is used not only as a constituent in moods and affairs, riddles laced with affections known only to the loving couple, and looks that linger too long. Love is also an often-used ingredient in some transparent verbal and nonverbal transactions where, eventually, it can sometimes be converted to a variety of true devotions, some of which yield tough, insoluble, love supplies approximately thirteen draughts of all energy that is derived from relationships. Its role and value in society at large are controversial.*""

Vivec would end the lesson with ""The secret to doom is within this Sermon"". Vivec demonstrated that the Dwemer did not love, by-the-book race who just could not know love. This surfaced in Kagrenac, who like his passionless race did not love, failed in his attempts to achieve transcendence, dooming the Dwemer to a non-existence.

Finally, will suffer the same damnation of the Dwemer. They oppose Lorkhan and actively try to remove him from existence. Therefore, they reject, too, his heart. They will never know love. Ultimately, it will be because of this that they fail.",,,Council,

By Carcinogen


The races of Tamriel vary greatly, and is split into two parts for the sake of convenience. This first half will deal with the Altmer, Argonians, Bosmer, Bretons and finally Dunmer.


**Altmer**


The Altmer have a great deal of respect for their ancestors, 3rd Edition, Crystal-Like-Law was a resting place for many:


&gt;""When the Aldmer came together as a people to create the Crystal Tower, living and dead. Within the glittering walls of the Tower are housed the graves of the early Aldmeri settlers""^2


When Crystal-Like-Law collapsed


The Altmer have gained a notoriety for taking and slaying some babies, it is unlikely these infants would be given the honor of being laid to rest in the towers.


**Argonians**


Little is known about how the Argonians deal with their dead. The moist climate of Black Marsh means that bodies rot very quickly; often


The Argonians who live by the coast are inclined towards sea burials^5, though like all races, they would rather have their remains returned to their homeland.^7


**Bosmer**


Some Bosmer adopt Imperial customs by burying their dead, they are strictly carnivorous, and will even resort to cannibalism. In fact, the Meat Mandate, a section of the Green Pact, says that the Bosmer must eat any enemy that they slay.^8 This reduces the number of bodies to bury, to an extent.


Another thing that is unique to the Bosmer is that they have the power to call upon a primal ability called the 'Wild Hunt'. In times of need, and those who survive tend to turn on each other.^9 While there have been very few Wild Hunts in history, there is often a shortage of corpses soon after one has taken place.


**Bretons**


The Bretons, but the fact that people in the south now tend toward Imperial burials in graveyards shows the influence that Cyrodiil has had on the Bretons.^4


**Dunmer**


Of all the races


Due to the billowing of Red Mountain, and so they are almost exclusively cremated. It would be unthinkable to leave them to rot, or to bury them in the Imperial manner.


In the past, so most Dunmer are put to rest in family ancestral tombs. Ashpits house the remains themselves, and offerings are made periodically, to please the dead.


Previously, were protected by a ghost fence. The deceased would provide a bone which would then be enchanted, and used to create a beacon, of sorts.
Due to the spread of the Corprus disease in the Third Era, and so it became convention to do so. Entire skeletons would be offered up, and so the Dunmer would ""venerate a small portion of their ancestor's remains kept at a local temple.""^10


In the Fourth Era, and many ancestral tombs were completely destroyed. Following this, the Argonian invasion forced many to flee the land.^12


The Dunmer have gradually been forced to forgo their culture,,False,,t5_2t5ay,False,,True
1365519624.0,1bzq5i,The Nords and the Giants,morganmarz,86,9,33,"We don't know a lot about the giants

The main body of lore that supports this is [The Seven Fights of The Aldudagga](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/seven-fights-aldudagga), ""The 911th Cow"". Let me quote here:

&gt;And of the **Giants** we speak little, it is a pain in the  to tell their stories and then clean all the things knocked down in the telling... and in a foreign hearth it is [just plain rude]. So we speak of them (for we must-- who does not honor their **parents**?) under the **rim of the sky** or, here, written on sheafs of pelt, for such is the mettle of their threat. This is [a song (or dirge, manuscript unclear)], then, like most

In other words this author, ""their history is hidden in long loud power-shouts,"" is interesting, and i'm not sure what implications it might have.  
Later on we have this:

&gt;Here is why: the **Giants** came from **Old Atmora**, they are our **true ancestors**-- do not believe your aunt from the university-- and, yes, we were once as big as them-- as tall as THIS-- but that is another story)... [text lost]... and after [the Great Calamity] happened [the clan-things (peoples? tribes? Text seems to indicate mankind as a whole, though that is debateable)]... we were of a kind disrupted... and we Nords fell into fighting and drove our Giant-kin up unto the mountaintops [and we were a wicked-folk for many years]... [until all] things had changed forever.

So the giants came from Old Atmora, but also the clothing reminiscent of the giants of modern day skyrim. Notice the swirls tattooed or carved into his skin. At the very least we can assume that MK is *implying* something pretty heavily. I won't get into the ""mankind as a whole"" thing because as the text says, it's ""debatable,"" much moreso than anything else here.
Continued:

&gt;Once the Moot resumed [(unspecified) years later] things got back to a new semblance of normalcy and borders were redrawn and agreed with in beer-talk, not pretty soon but whatever) the Giants began to come down from the mountains again. And they were a bit different than we Nords remembered, or perhaps we had forgotten much, but they would not speak to us anymore-- they would only smile in their lazy way, stomp over, and take our stuff.

Now maybe i'm mistaken, after whatever raidings they had, the Nords met again with the giants, and something seemed to have happened that had changed the giants, or maybe the nords, but probably both. They could no longer communicate. Now the giants are described as they act in *Skyrim*.

From then on we have the story of the child Aless (whose namesake is Alessia) painting the cows to summon the giants to fight Alduin. Dagon tries to trick her so she tricks him right back. What is really interesting though is that the tradition of painting cows for the giants continues into modern day Skyrim. Neat-o.  
About the swirls:

&gt;""Then of course the swirls

So the Giants do have a language

A lot of this hinges on not much more than swirls. [Let me show you.](http://imgur.com/a/ag7xm) Now

Remember how the Giants' ""history is hidden in long loud power-shouts""? Notice the swirls on the Bromjunaar monument; they come from the mouth as if to demonstrate the Thu'um. Now i'm not saying that stories are written in the swirls

**Basically**, they split, and they both probably shrunk a lot (that King looks awful big!), but the Nords moreso than the Giants. The ancient Nord-Giants had a distinctive style of art that was very heavy on the swirls. This style of art, and the symbolism that both cultures associated with it, has enabled the two now-distinct peoples to communicate (albeit in a rather sparse fashion) for centuries since.

---

Now i'd like to point out the main flaw in all of this: ears. Giants have pointed elf-like ears and Nords have human round ears. What's up with that? I don't know. Seriously no clue.

Edit: /u/aussum_possum reminded me of the frost giants and Karstaag. Way less is known about them. Suffice it to say that he frost giants of *Dawnguard* appear to be more savage than the normal giants of *Skyrim*. Karstaag is a frost giant who ruled over Rieklings during the events of *Morrowind: Bloodmoon*.

I'll start with this

**How will the result be recorded canonically if both sides can win?**

Well

* The Thalmor will make a move and overshadow the ending of the war.

* Tullius and Ulfric both die

* A Dragon Break (which is complete poppycock).

Now

The Stormcloaks will come out on top. They may not crush the Legion like they do in-game, and yet it still clings to pitiful life as a union of, in total, High Rock (untrustworthy and militarily incompetent), Skyrim (powerful and known to aid the Empire, but stands opposed as of now), and Cyrodiil (a province still recovering from the Great War with its troops spread too far and its leader dead). There's nothing left in the Empire for Skyrim

Along with this, no less). Not only is the Empire lacking, but independence is looking very beneficial to the Nords and everyone else.

Now

Dragon Breaks are incredibly rare and powerful events that don't just ""happen"". There are 2 possible endings to an utterly petty war, and no exceptions.

**Is the one who fights for either side actually the Dovahkiin?**

It's a question that doesn't really get asked, people always assume he's leading the charge during the Civil War questline. I feel like the Dovahkiin has very little reason to aid either side, and if he did, he'd very likely be mentioned in future sources (that is, it would read something like ""Although the Skyrim Civil War proved inconclusive, it was reported that during the latter days of the fighting, the Dovahkiin was found to have been fighting for both sides

First of all we see a group of warriors

Next off it moves to a scene of a siege of a fortress. I think the fortress is in the Jerrel mountains considering we can see unimpeded to the Imperial city. There are a number of Nords scaling the fortress and what looks to be Imperial Legion soldiers defending. The scene cuts to a nearby cliff and it looks like one of the human races is leading the assault.  We also see an Elven mage amidst the defenders. I'm hesitent to call her an Altmer or a Bosmer because she lacks the height

1346923730.0,zfxy9,Jel Language,lu_ming,81,12,27,"Hello everyone! I've been asked to post on the reddit the work I am doing on the Jel language
**Jel** is the language spoken in Black Marsh by the native Argonian race. It is famous in all of Tamriel for its complicated grammar and hellish pronounciation

**Pronounciation**

The Jel alphabet goes:

**a, e, g, h, i, j, jh, l, o, t

Jel has no *labial* consonants

**a** is pronounced like in English *father*.

**ch** sounds like a *ky* pronounced very fast

**d** is like in English *dog*.

**e** is pronounced roughly like the *ay* in *say* when stressed

**g** is like in English *go*.

**h** is like in English but voiced.

**i** is like the *ee* in English *free*

**j** is pronounced *dz*.

**jh** is pronounced like a very fast *gy*; it's the voiced counterpart to *ch*.

**k** is like in English *Kate*.

**l** is like in English *lake*

**lh** is really difficult. It's a voiced Welsh *ll* as in *Llanelli*. Put your tongue in the position for *l*

**ny** is somewhat like in *canyon*.

**n** is like in English *nine*.

**o** is like in English *so*

**q** is another difficult sound

**r** is a tap

**s** is like the *z* in English *zoo*.

**t** is like in English *too*.

**th** is always like in English *there*

**ts** is pronounced like in English *guts*.

**u** is like the *oo* in English *moon*

**w** is like in English *well*

**x** is a voiced German *ch* as in *Bach*.

**y** is like in English *yell*.

The last consonant appears as **p** only at the end of a word
The stress always falls on syllables containing a long vowel
Otherwise it falls on the penultimate.
There are also two sounds which are very alien to an English speaker
In Argonian, and **xh** which is a loud click of the tongue.

**Pronouns**

Jel has two sets of pronouns: the “connected” set, and a “disconnected” set, used for everything else.
The Argonians make no distinction in number

**Connected**

1st person: **sep**

2nd person: **xho**

3rd person: **suu**

4th person: **c'a**

The 4th person is a special pronoun which we could call a “hyper-inclusive we”, although this is misleading, since the Argonians perceive themselves as one when they're connected. Depending on context, it can be translated as “the whole world” or “the Argonian people” or other such expressions.

**Disconnected**

1st person: **see**

2nd person: **to**

3rd person: **thuu**

The “disconnected” set is a later derivation of the “connected” set, which Argonians perceive as being “disconnected” in some way. This is a very discomforting feeling to Argonians, which need to get used to it before interacting with other peoples on a long-term basis.
There is no “collective” 4th person.

**Use of the Pronouns**

All Argonians refer to themselves and their peers with the “connected” set of pronouns, an Argonian may refer to himself with the “disconnected” 1st person pronoun, to suggest humility, implying that he's not worthy of being connected through the same Hist as whatever person he's talking to. To address an Argonian with the “disconnected” 2nd person pronoun is in an of itself a powerful insult, and it's not that rare to hear enemy tribes refer to each other as thuu rather than suu. Conversely, every non-Argonian must refer to himself and to his peers with the “disconnected” set of pronouns. To do differently would be seen as unbelievably arrogant and insulting. Argonians may refer to non-Argonians with the “connected” set of pronouns when these strangers have done them a great favour or when they consider them close friends (eg. Mere-Glim probably addressed Annaïg with *xho*). 

**Syntax**

Unmarked word order is **OSV** (Object-Subject-Verb), it becomes OVS.

And

**Some Important Suffixes**

**The Possessive Suffix**

Jel marks the possessed noun

**The Ablative Suffix**

The suffix **-duj** means *from

**The Purposive Suffix**

The suffix **-to** means *(in order) to*.

**The Derisive Suffix**

The suffix **-luu** indicates amusement or mocking intent.

**The Locative Suffix**

The suffix **-daa** means *in

This is about it for the grammar at the moment.
Here's the sample sentences I've made:

**Suur Haj-Ei golt. **

*Hist.Sap Haj-Ei drink**

Haj-Ei drinks Hist-Sap

**Suur golt-suu.**

*Hist.Sap drink-he/she*

He/she drinks Hist-Sap.

**Hajhiit maagaruth goc'daa gooluu.**

*Khajiit cart-POS mud-LOC get.stuck-DER*

The Khajiit's cart got stuck in the mud.

**Thuu chakkuth lod Hajhiit c’oo? Hajhiit gortsuquth gorihuth thuu gooluthduj thdeitoluu!**

*they butt-POS lick Khajiit why? Khajiit cuisine-POS flavour-POS they mouth-POS-ABL chase.away-PUR-DER*

Why do Khajiit lick their butts? To get the taste of their cooking out of their mouths! (The famous ""Khajiit joke"")

UPDATE:

**The Jel Verb**

The Jel verb has no tense and doesn't distinguish between persons, two voices and three cathegories of evidentials. There are also suffixes which I call ""emotionals"", which specify how the speaker feels about the utterance, and various other suffixes.

**Aspect**

There are three aspects: the **perfective**

The **punctual** aspect is unmarked

**Gor Annaig tsuq.**

Annaïg cooks./Annaïg cooked./Annaïg will cook.

The **imperfective** mood is marked by the suffix **-re**

**Gor Annaig tsuqre.**

Annaïg is cooking./Annaïg cooked (but didn't finish)

The **perfective** mood is marked by the suffix **-loj**

**Gor Annaig tsuqloj.**

Annaïg has cooked.

**Mood**

There are five moods: the **indicative**, the **purposive** and the **optative**.

The **indicative** is unmarked and indicates that the sentence is a factual statement

**Gor Annaig tsuq.**

Annaïg cooks.

The **irrealis** is marked by the suffix **-uxh**

**Gor Annaig tsuquxh.**

Annaïg may be cooking.

The **imperative** mood is marked by the suffix **-lop**

**C'ee gor tsuqlop!**

Cook!

The **purposive** is marked by the suffix **-to**

**Gor Annaig tsuqto

In order for Annaïg to cook

The **optative** is marked by the suffix **-thelh**

**Gor Annaig tsuqthelh!**

How I wish Annaïg would cook!

In the imperial side I opted by the ""romanish"" lorica segmentata of skyrim's legionaries, they look better). As pointed by our colleagues there are orcs, red guards, nords and imperials among the legion's ranks (sadly they are hardly noticeable because of the low quality photograph). And finally, there is Titus II wielding goldbrand in all his glory, using a set of armor inspired by general Tulius armor.

As discussed in the previous post there's no evidence if the battle where Titus captured Naarifin was inside the city walls or in the open field. I opted by the open field for scenery reasons.

1361206178.0,18rae0,2E830-2E852 How Plausible ESO actually is.,Wabbstarful,86,17,96,"Well we have had some debate in the past on how well the lore works. Today I'm going to show you how I took a 180 on ESO after some research. I just want to present to you some facts on how this game can* be plausible for the lore-friendly scholar such as you beautiful people. 

**First of all: The Date**. (and some groovy background):

ESO takes place 1000 years before skyrim, well, the lot of you know those details already about the most glorious emperor to ever live, I digress. **2E852**, Cuhlecain of the Colovian Highlands marches to the Imperial city and crowns himself emperor. ""It's OVER!"" for ESO during this date, that is. This must mean that ESO takes place between 830 and 852. 

Ok so good start so far

**The Ebonheart Pact:**

The Ebonheart Pact is a joint agreement to ally Skyrim, these three despised neighbors have lightened up a *bit*. Now to accept their rationality for creating such a Pact I would suggest you all to consider the alliance during the Seven Years War with France, Austria and Russia. These blokes *HATED* each other, however, they knew a truce to destroy an even greater looming threat of two highly militarized nations (Britain and Prussia) was necessary. I see it that unifying after the invasion and being threatened by Molag Bal (not to mention HIS HUGE-ASS multiplied daedra army walking all over this damn place) is none-to-settling. Thus an arrangement must be made for the greater good and survival of these three nations. 

**Lastly**: 

This is probably the final factor, sacrifice in ALOT of things that you loved. Of course this will be inevitable, however, do not be too discouraged. The creators have been doing some pretty neat things that even I was surprised to see be pulled off. They have taken the original models of the creatures, buildings and items from Morrowind, Oblivion, and Skyrim and gave them new physics to coexist in the new Massive Uniserver. (I will share some of the videos with you all after) 

Second, *somewhat*. We need to understand that Zenimax wants to appeal to two crowds here. The people won't likely entirely look like them, perhaps with a more fable-Skyrim look to allow a smooth transition for MMO players. There has been ALOT of tweaking, fortunately, and the more I see release on the development, the more I seem to be wrong how warcrafty the characters are. Not to mention, we have a beta coming up with tons of fans from all fields who will most likely grill the creators with feedback (good feedback too i hope!) So keep this in mind when you watch or rewatch the gameplay footage at the end. 

And lastly to our ""Last Part"". GAMEPLAY. You will be able to see this for yourself

The rest is up to you

Now here is where I start to feel loopy. The Last Dragonborn is the completion of the Oversoul of Lorkhan, ala the mantella, but only when filled with the soul(s) of a Shezzarine. So what is to stop the souls of Lorkhan's avatars from having their souls combined after ""death"" to revive Lorkhan's heart and thus, Lorkhan himself.

Stretching a bit further now, Talos would return to being Lorkhan, and the Thalmor will have lost their chance to rid Nirn of Lorkhan, his avatars, and their influence.

**What is *The Elder Scrolls*?**

*The Elder Scrolls* (often abbreviated TES) is a series of RPGs (role-playing games) developed by Bethesda Game Studios. The series began with the release of *The Elder Scrolls: Arena* in 1994, *The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion* in 2006, and *The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim* in 2011. Aside from the main games in the series, TES has also spawned smaller games such as *An Elder Scrolls Legend: Battlespire* and *The Elder Scrolls Adventures: Redguard*.

TES has spiked in popularity with each release

**What is ""lore""?**

The prestigious Wiktionary describes lore as:

&gt;3. *All the facts and traditions about a particular subject that have been accumulated over time through education or experience.*

&gt; 2. *The backstory created around a fictional universe.*

&gt; 3. *(anatomy) The region between the eyes and nostrils of birds

In this sense, although probably not the third. But you have learned something new about biology.

Many fans have become devoted to TES lore because of it's uniqueness and sheer amount

The nature of TES lore has caused it to become almost separate from the games, or because lore is so intricate and vast that it would probably scare off the new player. It's most likely a combination of all three. Some argue that only the lore that is featured within the games can be canon.

**Who writes the lore?**

The lore is a collective effort of many developers at Bethesda, though, the lore is written by Michael Kirkbride, or ""*MK*"". Redguard and Morrowind were the games of TES that dramatically changed the lore and created vast amounts of new lore to form the foundations for the brilliance it is today. Before those games, TES was largely a generic fantasy game. It's no coincidence that Kirkbride has, during his short time at Bethesda, been a part of the development team only for those games. Kirkbride is largely responsible, for making TES lore the way it is today. Although no longer under official employment at Bethesda

MK is (in)famous for introducing weird and wonderful concepts into TES that are far from what put in front of us in the games. In fact, are often points of contention regarding the legitimacy of his ideas. Some don't consider his work to be canon at all.

If those people believe MK's work is too unofficial to be canon, lore is shaped and moulded and interpreted until it's difficult to see what's official and what's purely discussion-created conjecture. There's a name for such content - ""*monkeytruth*"". Entire texts written by fans can also be called monkeytruth, provided they make for good lore and tell us stuff we can't otherwise know. Lady N, librarian at The Imperial Library, explains well in her guide on [How to Become a Lore Buff](http://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1112211-how-to-become-a-lore-buff/):

&gt;*""Good lore evokes wonder

&gt;*Since Daggerfall the lore of the Elder Scrolls has been getting more alien and more complex. Concepts found elsewhere in fantasy - evil dark elves, all the while suspending our disbelief. Glass, which is fragile in reality, makes some of the best armor around. Blind priests go clothed in moths carrying the spirits of our ancestors. Swords cut atoms and brought about the fall of a continent.*

&gt;*BATW, and it relies on what we already know as opposed to what we can imagine. Giving the Bosmer art nouveau type architecture is BATW because it is expected, and because we have seen it in a dozen other depictions of elves. Likewise, attributing the fall of Yokuda to a natural earthquake is BATW due to its everydayness. Having it break asunder because of a sword move which is the equivalent of a nuclear bomb, on the other hand, is unusual and pushes our imagination.*

&gt;*Monkey Truth is good (unique, its main purpose is to expand what is already there. You will likely not encounter it in your initial studies, but threads on undeveloped subjects sometimes turn to the creation of monkey truth.*""

As mentioned before

**How do I know what is canon and what isn't?**

As far as r/teslore is concerned

If this is so, which allows any and all lore. In TES lore communities, since the beginning of time, there are those who exclude some aspecs of lore, so come along and try to ruin it for those who include them by saying they're ""non-canon"" or ""unofficial"" and therefore wrong. This is inconsiderate, not understanding of lore, and quite basically, so we aim to allow *all* fans of lore to discuss what they want.

How do we ensure that? Well, and those that consider out-of-game lore to be canon also. Let's call them Group A and B, respectively, and the lore they consider canon Lore A and Lore B, respectively. Lore A is exclusive of B, but B is inclusive of A. So:

*A ⊊ B*

*B ⊋ A*

Group B cannot go to Group A and say ""that is non-canon"" because Group B considers Lore A canon too. However, r/teslore allows the discussion of Lore B - that is to say, all lore. Group B can't shoot down Lore A, and Group A can simply ignore discussions involving Lore B and pay attention only to Lore A.

These are simply two generalized groups, and ignore stuff you don't like, whether you're in the Kult or the [Toddmeri Dominion](http://www.reddit.com/r/toddlore/comments/romhc/the_elk_mistake/). It keeps everyone happy. Also, don't bring up lore authenticity where it isn't relevant.

And yes

So as most of us know, and the events of Oblivion deactivated the White-Gold Tower that is, well, White-Gold Tower.  It makes sense, then, that Skyrim has its tower deactivated somewhere in the game.  If tradition holds, it would be during the main quest.  But nothing in the main quest seems to be an obvious stone like Talos' Oversoul (as Numidium's was), and Red Mountain's was)

Firstly, please do.  Anyways, the original plot, according to rumor, was finding that *The Dragonborn* (or at least the PC) is at fault for The Great Collapse.  Basically, The Dragonborn find that he/she did some weird shit with the Eye, causing The Great Collapse *in the past*.  So, yada yada yada, and the first two activations of Numidium are not that important, which caused five different timelines to converge into one.  The important part here is that Numidium caused it--a tower caused it.  The tower's power comes from its stone.  So

tl;dr of that whole spiel: Stones can cause (and are one of the few causes of) Dragon Breaks

Secondly, is very interested in the Eye of Magnus.  Now, I and others believe that the Thalmor are attempting to revert back to what they believe to be their immortal forms--Mer were once Et'ada.  It makes sense for them to desire that again.  According to theory, they believe that by deactivating all the towers, they may destroy reality and revert to their immortal selves.  Consider that Ancano, having this end game in mind, sees this immensely powerful artifact that literally radiates Magicka.  It makes sense that he would be interested in it.  In fact, as I believe

Thirdly, they take the Eye to ""protect it.""  It is important to note exactly what The Order of PSJJJJ is.  Essentially, they are a splinter group of the Altmer that *do not worship the Aedra*.  They worship their ancestors (the non-divine ones...).  They are not interested in returning to the state of the Et'Ada.  In fact, they don't want to.  Of all the groups in Tamriel to know what the various stones are, The Order of PSJJJJ is it, and I feel that they know that the Eye is a stone, and wish to protect it from deactivation.  Quaranir ends up doing this

So

The Dragonborn finds the eye, and attempts to stop him, killing him.  Quaranir tells you ""Congrats! You did it!"" and takes the Eye to protect it from [de]activation.

Next to the Nords, and Skyrim as an Argonian with a comletely different cultural mindset.

It's gotten me to thinking about why the relationship between the hist and the Argonians seems to be so one-sided some times. For example, but as soon as the Hist themselves are are in danger (re: the Oblivion Crisis), the Hist turn the Sahxleel into an engine of destruction comprised of hundreds of thousands of homicidal fast healing maniacs. Further, homicidal maniacs capable of going toe to tail with legions of highly skilled dremora, then giving the Rome-in-Carthage treatment to Dagon's very own realm in Oblivion. 

Why is that? Do the hist view the Argonians as a tool? What exactly is the cosmology of the Argonian race

Secondly, being the point of entry into Oblivion for the Argonians, would be deep inside Argonian held ""territory"" during the invasion of Dagon's realm. As such, the Dremora would have had to effectively reinvade these parts of their own realms to deactivate the Sigil stones and close the gates to Black Marsh. 

I would think that the efforts necessary to accomplish this would have significantly detracted from the available pool of forces to invade other areas, more time to effictively respond to the threat. Just a thought. ",,False,,t5_2t5ay,False,Dwemer,

From my understanding, as well as a historic ban on dwemer trade, skooma, and moonsugar. Its been a long time since I've played Morrowind so I'm not exactly sure if that's right. During the period of Skyrim, does it fit lore to ban trade in dwemer artifacts, raw ebony, raw malachite, moon sugar? Does the empire have the practical authority over trade? Do the people of Skyrim even obey imperial law?

Right now, skooma, moon sugar, and dwemer related artifacts and armors set to a 0 placeholder value, thereby bypassing imperial law as you aren't ""trading"" the items as you get nothing in return.

I'm also changing container inventories to reflect a stronger economy-based class system. I'm estimating that a landless laborer (such as whiterun woodchopper Sigurd) makes an annual salary of 48o septims, noble (people who don't work at all but own land like nazeem) 11.ooo septims, thane 48.ooo septims, and jarls 96o.ooo for Falkreath up to 2.65o.ooo for Solitude. I plan to adjust the annual earnings against what I can estimate living expenses and deposit the savings into the NPC homes, adding some immersion to would-be thieves.

For example, Whiterun home at 15.84o, Markarth home at 32.64o, Solitude home at 94.8oo; LIFESTYLE room rentals from 11 to 2o, a meal of mead and steak at 6, farm clothes at 6, lute at 6o, diamond gold ring at 1.8oo, full leather armor at 8o

From what I understand, blacksmith guild wages, baron (anglo-thane) salaries, and earl (anglo-jarl) incomes. The lifestyle costs were determined from recorded inventories and tax records. The armor and weapons also from inventories, with full leather armor costing 64 pence, peasant sword at 6 pence, milanese plate armor at 2604 pence

Do the numbers seem off?

This is concerning the Civil War. I'd like to change blacksmith inventories to include only leather, with massive stockpiles of imperial armor, guard armor, stormcloak armor, depending on the hold. With the exception of the skyforge, all blacksmiths will pretty much only produce armor and weapons concerning the war effort. Is this logical?

Last, with the occasional bandit deserter in full imperial armor / stormcloak armor, does that fit into the lore? I only have bandits to compare to in oblivion with its horrible loot system, so I'm not sure if its more fitting to have poor bandits than armor clad bandits. I'm assuming bandits of Skyrim to overwhelm merchants on the road in numbers, mostly to scare and steal rather than be marauding bandits that raid villages. Any lore of this at all? In turns of in game content, all I noticed was one bandit ambush trap (flipped cart on the road), and one wagon raided by falmer

Argonians, or do they want everyone else to fuck off? Let's take a look at history:

Early records tell that Argonians were already present when the Al*d*mer began exploring Tamriel

During the First Era these foreigners were mostly pirates, which were the foreigners they really knew, kinda were assholes). The Alessian Empire drew back after the cleansing, however, Black Marsh remained a province of the Empire (though it's worth noting that they only could govern certain pockets close to the coast and boarder). The Empire then decided that it was a good idea to use Black Marsh as a prison for the worst criminals they had...

Now, then let me summarize briefly; The Knahaten Flu was some seriously lethal and viral shit that could most easily be compared to a junction of the Black Plague and the Swine Flu. This outbreak is important in understanding the Argonian situation, because it had such an immense impact on the province. Everything in Argonia that didn't have scales died, and the flu took a large *bite* of the population of the other provinces as well. The origin of the Knahaten Flu is debated. Some say it was a mutation of one of the many dangerous deceases of the Argonian Jungle, and some say... that it was... **created**... *que the dramatic music*

Supposedly

In the Third Era, so they could work the regions that the other races couldn't endure. Bandit raids into the province increased, and more and more Argonians were enslaved. A slave revolt in Morrowind were retaliated by the Dunmer going even further into Argonia, and also enslaving any Argonian (and Khajiit) that ventured into the Eastern part of the Empire. Now your probably thinking, why didn't the Empire do anything about it, seeing how enslaving any civilized race is illegal? Well, the thing is; it was heavily frowned upon, and due to some favorable conditions in their treaty with the Empire

Eventually, while the Dunmer were heavily weakened by the loss of their living gods and the Oblivion Crisis, the Argonians were stronger and more unified than ever. They secede from the Empire, and invade Morrowind. They sack the south of Morrowind, including Mournhold, but are repelled by House Redoran. After the sacking of Morrowind the Argonians draw back into Argonia, and that is the last large event up to present day.


Now, and also a bad relationship with most of the other races. They have a history of being used, which seeds the notion that the other races are either going to

a. use their home as base for pirating 

b. use their home as base for their bandit-ing 

c. enslave them

This leads the native Argonians to fear/hate anyone who aren't an Argonian, but there are definitely in-game encounters that portray imperialized Argonians as reclusive or hostile, as well as the occasional friendly one. So, to answer the question we started with: ***bite*** (at least in Argonia)




Sorry about the profanities. I were just trying to grab your attention. Anyway, and thought it would be a good idea to start a new thread focusing on a specific race that don't get all the love it deserves. As far as I know, ""noobie-knowledge"" on Argonian history is that ""you know, they were slaves to the Dunmer or something"", which is true, but still could be a little more informed. I would love if anyone more well-versed in Argonian lore than me could educate us a little on the fine people of Argonia  *turns the giant X spotlight onto the night sky*",,,,

Contrary to popular belief (both in Tamriel and in the real world)

&gt; The usual Imperial arrogance. The hoary old ""Out of Atmora"" theory has been widely discredited (no reputable archaeologist would publicly support it these days), it appears to in the eyes of the ever-gullible public which continues to snap up the latest Pocket Guides along with the rest of their Imperial Certified pablum. 

There is a very distinct difference. I think the easiest way to explain it is to explain the origins of each of these confusing races.

**The Nords**

The Nords come from Atmora, the ""proto-Nords"" (ancestors of the modern Nords, following the Dragon Cult), like Ysgramor and his Five Hundred or Thereabouts Companions, sailed from Atmora to Tamriel, where they landed in Skyrim, which they called Mereth (land of the elves).

They did not know that they were not the first men on Tamriel, does the Imperial Geographical Society. According to an old text referenced in the [1st Edition PGE](http://imperial-library.info/content/pocket-guide-empire-first-edition-high-rock), they first encountered Nedic people (specifically early Bretons) in High Rock. They mistook them for elves and set about killing them until one spoke to them in Nordic.

**The Nedes**

The Nedes were Tamrielic aboriginal humans, and by the Direnni clan in High Rock (where they interbred with the elves to become early Bretons). [The Adabal-A](http://imperial-library.info/content/adabal) lists the Nedes as but one tribe of men, alongside the Kothri, the Keptu, the Men-of-Ge, the Men-of-'Kreath, and several others. 

Nedes already lived in Cyrodiil and Direnni High Rock when Ysgramor and co. landed in Skyrim. 

It is my view, despite really referring to a specific tribe of aboriginal proto-Cyrodiils, is used as an umbrella term for all of these aboriginal races, so the Keptu and Al-Gemha, while not actually of the Nede race/tribe, were ""Nedic people"".

**The Bretons**

The 1st Edition PGE claims Bretons were the descendants of Nord slaves captured at Saarthal, the [3rd Edition PGE](http://imperial-library.info/content/pocket-guide-empire-third-edition-sons-and-daughter-direnni-west-high-rock) perhaps corrects this, stating that ""the Aldmer coming from Summerset Isle were the first to settle and form permanent communities. The early Nedic people who arrived next were stumbling upon a highly sophisticated culture, and were quickly overwhelmed and absorbed"". Of course, the IGS was probably still of the opinion that ""Nedic people"" were Nords, but who knows. 

In any case, where the Direnni were well-established as a culture, and were absorbed into what became known as the Direnni hegemony. It was these post-absorption ""Manmeri"" that the confused Nords encountered in the Reach.

Nowadays, are fractious and sectarian. But back on topic...

**The Imperials**

This is where it is a little more confusing, toiling under the Ayleids.

Alessia (/Perrif/Al-Esh/etc.), they had considerable assistance from their new northern neighbours, the Nords (who hated elves due to the Night of Tears and the associated conflicts). Morihaus, the Bull of Kyne, and Alessia's consort, came from Skyrim. When the Ayleids were overthrown (circa 1E243), the Nords and proto-Cyrodiils found that they had essentially inherited the continent, referring to their conquests in High Rock and Morrowind). This led to some interbreeding

The modern day Imperials are divided into two broad groups, the Ayleids are said to have "" herded in men from across all the Niben"", so perhaps not the early Colovians. The Ayleids definitely ruled Colovia, however; it is just as littered with their ruins as Nibenay.

**The Redguards**

The Redguards are probably feeling pretty left out, a continent to the West of Tamriel. It was destroyed in a cataclysm of debated origin, and in 1E 808, they came to Tamriel in a deadly invasion, brutally conquering what is now Hammerfell. Over time, their need to trade and communicate meant that they effectively lost their native language of Yoku, and picked up many cultural traits from the neighbouring Nedic people.

**The Starry Heart of Dawn's Beauty**

There is one more thing to bear in mind when tracing human ancestry in Tamriel. The [Nu-Mantia Intercept](http://imperial-library.info/content/nu-mantia-intercept) puts forward the theory that ""All mortal life started on the starry heart of Dawn's beauty

Now as far as I'm aware, everyone started out in Tamriel, and divided in the earliest days of history.

**Conclusion**

So that's that. I hope this helps

1355117296.0,14l8r9,The Common Khajiit mindset and the assimilation into Tamrielic culture,Mr_Flippers,72,10,20,"First in this post

The best way we can understand the Khajiiti mindset is through the Ahzirr Traajijazeri. Of course not all of it

First
&gt; The Khajiit mind is not engineered for self-reflection. We simply do what we do

That right there is a very simplistic way of putting it

To consider this, then they do it. To structure it, The Khajiit have the what, where, how and when concepts but not the why. The why is irrelevant to them.

Now when I say its irrleveant


Now here's where it's going to get harder
&gt; ""q'zi no vano thzina ualizz"" -- ""When I contradict myself

I think this could be referring to the Khajiits deceptive nature (which if you don't know is a gift given to them by Azurah. They are able to hide their true nature and intentions.). In this interpretation, actions speak more truthfully than words.

There can be other interpretations for this, but think of it as when they lie, they are further understanding the truth that they hide.


A small addition here


Now I'm going to cover the Khajiit mindset that we see more often in TES. First you're probably thinking what's up when the Khajiit so often speak in third person but there's also a number of cases where they refer to themselves as I. I believe this to be the cause of Tamrielic culture (most notably Cyrodiilic) being constantly present around the Khajiit's day to day life. After long enough I believe the Khajiit just use the term I to replace their name in sentences

I believe that last part can be shown when comparing Oblivion and Skyrim. In oblivion you have several Khajiit who work and live in cities just like regular people and it's in oblivion where I found the most I's. In Skyrim however

Also I remember a particular Khajiit in oblivion who was complaining about the Argonians in the city, but she goes on to say some downright nasty things, I think she later requests you kill an Argonian on a Thieves guild quest of which you are meant to steal only. She states that they aren't like Khajiit and not even Imperial (this could be interpreted as she sees Khajiit as EITHER higher or lower in hierarchy to Imperials) showing a clear bias. I'm not saying that racism isn't unheard of in Elsweyr but the quote made her seem like she was so deserving, I think a trait picked up from living around Imperials for so long who appear to me to have at least some form of entitlement towards things, at least that a concept of deserving something exists to them and this has negatively affected the Khajiit, altering a part of her mindset.

At first

EDIT: I've noticed a link between the Khajiit's lack of the idea of I and the turning of the wheel that creates an I shape inducing CHIM. If you guy's want to make a post about that

*Welcome back to the seventh volume of 'On the Species of Tamriel'. This one deals with the feline cats of Elsweyr, have enjoyed the interest and fascination of many scholars, along with the disdain of many non-scholars of Tamriel. Without further ado, her is 'The Cursed and Blessed Cats'.*

The Khajiit (meaning 'desert walker' in their own language Ta'agra, often looked down upon by other races, because of their approach to thievery and possession.

There is much to say about the biology of the Khajiit. So much
The form a Khajiit takes is decided by the stance of the moons, to the anthropomorphic cats common throughout Tamriel, to seemingly feral tiger beasts, and everything in between.  
What can be said however, Khajiit have some feline traits, be it a slight fur and sharper nails, to the appearance of a cat. Along with this, they all have some form of pointed ears, be it more Mer in appearance, or more feline.  
Even though these fast differences in outward appearance, a blessing given to them by Azura. Along with this ability, Azura also gifted them with an excellent agility, so they are the fastest and best climbers on Tamriel. Along with this, they are rumoured to be the best survivors, especially in their own deserts of Elsweyr.

The origin of the Khajiit is one shrouded in myth and folktales. The Altmer (along with most other races) hold that they were already present on Tamriel since before men and mer came, and it is unknown if there had already been some Aldmeri groups who emigrated to the mainland. Furthermore, epics are always a dubious source when it comes to historical events.  
The Khajiit themselves believe they are descendents of the same group as the Bosmer, in stead referring to creatures that change in form constantly (a theme also present in Bosmeri religion).  
According to the Khajiit, stasis and change. Out of the first litter came the Et'Ada often classified as Aedra: Alkosh (Akatosh), Khenarthi (Kynareth), Magrus (Magnus, also the only one who isn't regarded as an Aedra), Mara, and S'rendarr (Stendarr). These forces all symbolise the more common things on Mundus, who are generally seen as Daedra: Hermorah (Hermaeus Mora), Sangiin (Sanguine), and their addiction to skooma and moonsugar.  
After this, birthing the moons Jode and Jone (Masser and Secunda), Nirni (Nirn (Mundus was not yet created, but this might be a metaphor for Mundus) and Azurah (possibly a metaphor for Oblivion in general). Ahnurr was enraged, because he didn't want any more children, and mortally wounded Fadomai. She fled and birthed her last cub, Lorkhaj (Lorkhan), just before she died, along with Nirni, which was vital in keeping the other children of Fadomai out. Azurah kept Ahnurr and Lorkhaj from hearing it

Even though this is obviously a myth, a core of truth. The Khajiit do hold a special link to the moons, as their forms are decided by the stance of them, and it is rumoured that the Khajiit did climb up to Secunda at least once. Their link to the elves is also probably more than myth.

Khajiiti politics are vastly different from those of the other provinces. Historically, the Thrassian Plague hit, and devastated much of Elsweyr and the Khajiit. Only two kingdoms remained: Anequina in the north, and Pellitine in the south. The conflict ended with the marriage of the rulers of these two kingdoms in 2E 309, forming a unified Elsweyr for the first time. The relative peace was mainly kept by the Mane, a almost mythical spiritual leader, who is born when the moons align, when the mane was murdered and the Thalmor staged a coup d'etat. Anequina and Pellitine were restored
As is standard for Khajiit, they don't believe investing time in power is worthwhile.

This attitude towards things is standard for Khajiit, most Khajiit are (sometimes wrongly) perceived as thieves. If a house is empty (even if the owner is just away for a moment), a Khajiit might decide to stay there. Not because he won't buy his own place, but because a empty house is of no use, and he might use it just as well. The same thing applies to possession: if it is not clearly stated that it is someone's property, than it is no one's.  
It is important to understand that this does not mean that thievery is accepted by Khajiit. If it is clear that it is someone else's property, taking other's property is only acceptable if it is to the good of the family or clan, as egoistic reasons are despised.

The history of the Khajiit is not extremely well known, who were all but destroyed after the Thrassian Plague, forming Anequina and Pelletine, who merged in the united province of Elsweyr. This union remained until the aftermath of the Void Nights, a period in which the moons had disappeared. This was incredibly influential on the Khajiit, as these had huge importance for them. It is unknown what happened to the Khajiiti born during the Void Nights, but it is likely that they were all stillborns. After the moons reappeared, which justified the coup to overthrow the kingdom of Elsweyr, already outside of Imperial influences since the Oblivion Crisis

1372935239.0,1hmlmo,Summarizing Talos,Asotil,68,6,58,"So I'm trying to teach my interested buddies about TES lore in a way anyone can understand. I wrote the following on Talos

**Early Existence as Tiber Septim***

* Before he was the Ninth Divine

* Tiber Septim was raised in Skyrim

* Eventually, but all of Tamriel. To do so, however, he would have to head south to Cyrodiil.

* A petty ruler of Cyrodiil named Cuhlecain saw young Talos' potential and appointed him as his general. 

* With Talos' help

* High Rock and Skyrim

* The Nords of Skyrim met Talos and Cuhlecain's forces on the field of Sancre Tor

**Rise to Power**

* Still the Bretons of High Rock continued their assault. One night

* It is true that both Cuhlecain and his palace were destroyed that night. But when Cuhlecain's men came to save their king

* During this period

* During his conquest of Tamriel, Talos did not possess the Heart.

* Luckily Talos had a friend, becoming the Underking.

* After Talos conquered all of Tamriel, but that is another story.

* Talos went on to rule Tamriel for many

* Though it is true that Talos was the rightful king of Men

**Godhood and others**

* First

* When Talos became a god is unknown. Some say that it was after the attempt on his life. Others say that it was after his death. What is important is that he *did* become a god. That is definitive.

* To understand how Talos became a God

**Divinity: The universe and a God**

&gt;The extinction of self is salvation; the annihilation of self is the condition of enlightenment; the blotting out of self is Nirvana.

* In nirvana, he eliminates that concept, thus becoming one with the universe.

* In the Elder Scrolls universe

* Furthermore

* With so many definitive gods

* HOWEVER, essentially. Very few people know of its existence, and those who do-well, let's see later.

* Nirvana also exists within the Elder Scrolls universe. In achieving it

* However (again), nirvana is a very *very BAD* thing in TES.

* There is

**CHIM: The sacred seal of royalty.**

* In CHIM, you *are* the Godhead. Instead of comprehending ""I AM NOT"", you comprehend ""I ALL ARE WE"".

* Fundamental to CHIM is forsaking logic. CHIM is like ordering a birthday cake, by the way.)

* What does CHIM require instead of logic? Love. You love your own self

**Talos as a God**

* Talos achieved CHIM. Again

* Why does Talos not intervene regularly? The other eight Divines have the excuse of being weakened by their role as Aedra. Talos is not an Aedra and has no such excuse. Again

* Let's take the recent Oblivion Crisis as an example. Why didn't Talos stop  it? He certainly could have, Uriel Septim, Martin Septim, Chancellor Ocato, and everyone else involved! 

* That is true, and even good old Mehrunes Dagon himself through CHIM. He has no reason to stop himself from harming himself.

* Now as to why the Thalmor want to suppress Talos and Talos' friend Zurin Arctus

1358792950.0,170264,Raid on Pyandonea,OPGreenback,71,9,21,"**Raid on Pyandonea**

As Recorded by Atticus Plinius.

*Author’s Note: Raid on Pyandonea, I had never heard it in all my studies and travels until I heard it told in the city of Luftahraan by a local bard, one Timan Amedee. I was immediately enthralled by the tale. After the telling, I approached Amedee and inquired as to where he had learned it. He told me of a storyteller by the name of Yngmir, who had been an elderly man when the bard had only begun learning his craft, and who has since passed on. I traced Yngmir’s history as far back as I could, but found nothing substantial, considering the Nordic origins and occupation of Yngmir himself

*This lack of a definitive source places the tale in a dubious light. Its fantastic nature, Nordic tales are known for their fantastic and exaggerated natures; although it is certain that the story is not true in its entirety, there may be some truth in the central plot points. Perhaps an Atmoran fleet truly did circumnavigate Tamriel, stopping at Pyandonea along the way. The possibility of some small measure of truth is supported by the story’s descriptions of Pyandonea, which match with what little we know of the continent. It is unlikely that a man of Yngmir’s education could invent a story that so accurately reflects such an obscure continent. In short, Raid on Pyandonea is either a near-forgotten fragment of Atmoro-Nordic history, or a clever and unlikely modern forgery built upon the local Dreadmund mythos.*


The Dreaded Bomundl Dragon of the Sea, leading a fleet of his own, his Something More Than Five Hundred Companions. But unlike Ysgramor, he chose not to claim land and build cities. Instead, he set out to explore the whole of Tamriel, to find foreign lands and to fight foreign foes. [Dreadmund, in his explorations and battles, a forerunner of the times to come.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DU203TWhrTE)

To count several of the Atmoran longboats of Dreadmund’s fleet, Thendwyr Twice-Torc’d captained *Pillager*, and many others captained many others; as a whole, the fleet was too great to account for in swift. By the time of this story, the fleet had even, during its visit to Yokuda, absorbed a pair of strange Yoku ships captained and crewed by strange, unnamed men who could not speak to the Atmorans with words

Our story begins at nightfall over an oddly violent sea; the southern elven sea, angry at the trespass of Dreadmund and his Something More Than Five Hundred Companions. Waves crashed into ships and tried to split hulls, but the raging sea was still more or less kind in terms of the experiences of the Atmorans; the Sea of Ghosts was this violent on a good day. Dreadmund stood waiting impatiently aboard his longboat *Snow Whale* as it rocked back and forth in the waves. He cloak flew back behind him in the wind as though it were a pair of wings, outstretched and ready to carry him into the air. He awaited the return of his Clever Man, Fhalne, whom he had sent to the High Elf city of Alinor to gather hostages for interrogation. They needed more information before embarking on the journey to come.

Aboard the split-tailed *Snow Whale*, elf crushing glory, was his Boat-Thane Kehlet the Quick-Eared who could hear whispers leagues away, his Mumbler Hgenral who was an expert of mutter-magic, his oarsmen, Friedrung the Hammer, Oar-Wielding Olad, Hjaloc, Thurjac, who watched over Dreadmund’s pets who were Fiiq the House-Cat

“Where in the blasted seas is he!” Dreadmund growled

War-Wife Vjali answered

Dreadmund grimaced. “It’s my duty as Captain to worry. If Fhalne and his men linger much longer

For a moment, but the ships’ crews kept the fleet afloat. The sun peeked over the spiked waters at edge of the horizon, and set the sea sparkling.

“See? Dawn is coming. If they’re still there

Vjali opened her mouth and made to speak.

“They’re back!” Kehlet shouted from somewhere on the ship, too!”

Dreadmund chuckled, throaty sound. “Guess they did find trouble.” He cleared his throat and Thu’umed so that every crew could hear him, “Weigh anchors and ready sails, we’re leaving!” The waves were frenzied further with his words, and a stray, stormless thundercrack or two boomed through the sky, as happens when the Greybeards call a new Dragonborn to High Hrothgar.

Clever Man Fhalne and those who accompanied him (who were Mjardel, Flame-Grin Sorga who enjoyed throwing flasks full of fire at his foes, Jarnhal, Lungaehm, Ben the Bedeviled, Swajfwen, the four High Elf captives that the men had claimed, dragging their faering quickly after.

Fhalne began speaking before his salt-crusted boots had even cleared the gunwale. “We should leave

“You heard him, while we welcome our new guests.”

Fhalne sat, I mean. The city looks like it’s made of diamond. For all I know, it probably is. We should raid it. Attack in the night, burn out their ships, find where they hide their valuables. There’s probably a lot worth taking in that huge Tower, which—”

“Not interested. Let’s interrogate the prisoners; I want to know more about this ‘Pyandonea’ place we’ve been hearing about.”

“But—”

Dreadmund sighed

***

Most of their guests didn’t have much to say. One was a drunk who had been wandering around the docks looking for whatever High Elves drink, and had been speaking to the third captive, a sailor from one of the crystalline ships docked in the harbor. The fourth refused to speak at all, so he died first, thrown overboard to flail in the water, handless and hapless. The one in charge of numbers died second because he knew nothing about Pyandonea, and the drunk died third, though

He spoke of the Sea Elf raids that came to the his Isles so often. He spoke of their ships with bug-sails and bug-hulls and serpent skin for rope. He spoke of their tactics, and trick unwary Admirals. He spoke of the sea serpents themselves, who only came with the strongest of the Sea Elf fleets, the fleets led by Orgnum. In battle, the serpents would dive underwater and rise beneath High Elf ships, wrapping around them and crushing them. He told the Atmorans, too

They conjured mists wherever they liked, from the big continent, and even from the vague land called Aldmeris.

***

The Mist-Veil loomed ahead. It blocked any view of the true horizon, colossal. With all their magic, the High Elves had never pierced it, and as of today, they never have.

The Atmoran fleet stayed its course

“Mist-Veil’s ahead! Thu’um-Thanes, to compensate for the wind we’re ripping out of them!”

And all the men on all the ships of Dreadmund’s fleet heard his booming Thu’um, the great fleet cut into the Mist, and was soon engulfed by it. The Clear Sky Thu’ums warded off the Mist, lending the fleet a bubble of clear air and allowing the Atmorans some breathing room. [The Atmorans pushed onward, with nothing but endless Mist in sight.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=W3DiENnA3gw#t=66s)

***

“We’re coming out of this Mist!”

Dreadmund, the sun had climbed halfway to its zenith. He cast his eyes downward and saw it his objective just ahead. Pyandonea; hostile cliff faces jutting from the sea, each crowned by abundant green, jagged, unwelcoming rocks that warned sailors away and strange, obscuring mists that hid much of the land from sight. And speaking of sight, not a single safe harbor or kind beach was in sight. It looked like they’d have to do a little searching.^4

Kehlet approached and echoed Dreadmund’s thoughts. “Captain

“Go ahead.”

Kehlet rushed off, or at least some of it for a time, as he had so many other lands.

And then a fleet of strange ships shot from behind the closest islands. Their hulls, and the sails seemed to be the wings of the same, a single pair of rising from the deck, straight up with a slight tilt. The decks were built of green-tinted wood, probably with rooms built of the same below deck. The rigging and other ropes were the white, tightly coiled skin of whatever sloughed off of the Pyandonean serpents, as the Sea Elf had told them. The fleet announced its presence with the bugling of Pyandonean trumpets, shriller

And then Dreadmund’s grin became a smile, and he laughed aloud. “Get ready for battle!”

The strange fleet—the Sea Elf fleet—was preceded by a vanguard of serpents of all colors, but of the iridescent beetle-shell hulls and insect-wing sails of the ships, made the Sea Elf fleet seem as much a rainbow as a threat. The elves even wore bright, colorful dress, distracting the eye from the dismal pallor of their skin, as white as pure snow.

Suddenly

One serpent, sped ahead of the rest, spanning the distance between the fleets in the space of a hiccup. It dived under the waves, and a moment of eerie stillness passed before the creature shot up from the water, writhing and coiling itself around the *Snow Whale* two times over. It reared its head and bit at Dreadmund, who caught hold of its fangs, both twice the length of a horker tusk. Dreadmund tore out the right fang and used the other as a lever to push the serpent’s head to the deck. He stomped his foot onto the creature’s lower jaw to keep it steady and drove the serpent’s loose fang into its right eye. It shrieked, with his Quick-Ears

“Jahson, Savage! Chop this thing up while I’ve a hold on it, and clear the deck!”

They jumped at his command and began hacking. It spasmed against the deck, the serpent’s cries subsided. The last thing it saw was Dreadmund’s horned shadow playing across the deck. Dreadmund shoved its now bodiless head off the deck.

The rest of the Atmoran fleet hadn’t fared so well; though the blue serpent had been the swiftest, and even forcefully dragging them down.

But Dreadmund did not have time to help them. The Sea Elf fleet was fast approaching

***

The Atmorans won the battle.

At the onset, which the Thu’um-Thanes could not clear away without clearing their own Storm as well, and all became a chaos of lightning flashes and indistinct shapes. The Atmoran ships rammed into Sea Elf ships, Thu’um-Thanes grappled with serpents, Sea Elves charged with their skin alight with violent, rapidly changing hues, a strange distinction from their usual pallor. In the end, half of the fleet dodging behind and between islands in flight after the other half sank to the bottom of the sea. The losses of the Atmoran fleet were not nearly as grievous; only a quarter of Dreadmund’s fleet was felled. The Sea Elf fleet was stronger than any naval force the Atmorans had yet faced

Dreadmund led a shore party of forty and set up camp on the one tiny strip of beach they could find. Four faerings’ worth of fighters; Captain Dreadmund, War-Wife Vjali, Oar-Wielding Olad, the three elf-slave translators, Raving Savage the Welwa, and Beast-Keeper Mnetnen of the *Snow Whale*, Captain Thendwyr Twice-Torc’d, Ghemek, Kaewyn who used the curved swords of the Yokudans, Captain Orvar the Wheezing

The shore party’s camp was rushed at best

A Sea Elf rose from sea, drew their weapons, and trained them upon the elf, but he calmly made noises and then the Sea Elf translator made noises and then the Bird Elf translator made noises and then the Snow Elf translated, “Lower your weapons, I would have words!”

The warriors ignored the elf’s words until Dreadmund waved their weapons down; they did not trust the elf-slaves

The Sea Elf saw Dreadmund’s motion and met his eyes, leader of the foreign fleet?”

“I’m the Dreaded Bomundl, now.”

The elf-slaves made noises in turn again and when the Sea Elf translator finished speaking

“What’s he saying? Why aren’t you three translating?”

The Snow Elf stared at him

Dreadmund growled and drew his sword. “See this blade? It’s called the Ice Blade of the Monarch. It was made to kill a king. The specific king is dead now

When the words, the King’s smile turned into a grimace. His thrice translated response was, “You would like to fight? I was hoping to persuade you to leave, but I accept, only on the terms that we fight as tradition dictates: we shall fight on the shore, knee-deep in the sea. Do you accept my terms?”

Dreadmund nodded.

***

Dreadmund and Orgnum stood ten paces away from one another, glaring down at the Ysmir and the Orgnum. Dreadmund stood in full battle attire of tough mail, horned helm, clawed gauntlets, and swirling cloak, as always, and held the Ice Blade of the Monarch aloft with a single hand. Orgnum stood in casual clothing, but he had left his elf-slave translators on the shore along with the others—and

Dreadmund gripped his blade in both hands and charged, hoping to slosh down Dreadmund’s throat and drown him standing up. Dreadmund cut through the nearest one, and where the Ice Blade touched it, its water froze. He hacked at it amid a mad torrent of flying water, frozen chunks sloughing off with each slash, and the thing collapsed. Dreadmund spat out a mouthful of water; though it hadn’t managed reach his lungs, the creature had managed to fill his cheeks. The second one leapt into the air, hoping to spill down Dreadmund’s throat as he stood unawares. Dreadmund cut through it lengthwise as it leapt, and Dreadmund Thu’umed the moment before it touched his lips. His Thu’um froze it unto ice

Dreadmund rose and looked back to Orgnum, with white scales and blank eyes, staring at Dreadmund. His fangs dripped with venom whiter than his pure snow scales, his leering eyes were full of malice, and his coils rolled through one another like slow ocean waves. Dreadmund glared into his eyes and saw power behind them, power like his Thu’um. Orgnum was a powerful opponent, and Dreadmund was not exactly sure that he could match him. The damned wizard had hidden it earlier

And Orgnum would see Dreadmund now, MOVE-MAN-CROWN, the Dragon of the Sea who was Crowned as an Ysmir, the Crowned Man who Flew through the world on the back of a snow whale, on the back of the *Snow Whale*. He crouched to the ground on all fours, wings-as-arms and legs gripping into the ground with hooked claws. He whipped his long, spiked tail back and forth. He spread his fanged maw wide and Thu’umed, bending his wings-as-arms to his body and stealing his flight. Dreadmund clawed and bit at Orgnum

***

War-Wife Vjali gritted her teeth in anger. She had just watched her husband die. She was shocked, as if looking for something to kill, preferably an elf. Unfortunately, none were present—besides the elf-slave translators, but they were still needed—for the Atmorans had taken no prisoners during the initial battle. That was for later.

Without an elf to behead for some small solace

“Everybody aboard the faering! We’re going to search for my husband!”

***

As Vjali and those who accompanied her in the faering rowed out, bearing Orgnum’s corpse in his arms, burst out of the water and into the air. The violent waves of his emergence shoved the faering aside and nearly submerged it, but those aboard it, as well as those aboard the longboats in the distance, ignored the waves and watched in awe as Dreadmund, in flight, ripped out his heart

He looked up

***

A month later, their outpost had been a mere camp on a beach, but it had grown and it was alternately called Smallwall and Narrowwall (for the wall was too small to be called broad, and the beach was too narrow to ever hold a broad wall). At first, they knew nothing of the land, but they stole the oracle bones of Hermium who was a friend of the Sea Elves and who the Atmorans hated as though he was an old enemy. From the oracle bones, they learned to navigate the reaching kelp without being caught (which, they had not encountered during the initial battle) and they learned to effectively fight the Sea Elves and their sea serpents, words for battle cries

They had learned, many of the serpents could, more or less, Thu’um with their eyes. The most common examples were those serpents that shot jets of fire, streams of frozen wind, or both from their eyes (but never both at once, of course). There were serpents that could drain men’s vitality with a glance, serpents that could Stare men’s weapons out of their hands

As the Atmorans explored further and further into Pyandonea, a giant who howled “Ilyadi” and who was like the karstaag-men except that he had more eyes, beaked reptiles with domed shells, and a wide variety of bizarre fish. They also found a great many rewards for their exploration: a shield that struck those who beheld it with fear, a flask that made the imbiber briefly immune to magicka, a sword which spread the injuries of a single enemy to all nearby enemies with each cut, and a chest filled with gold which, refilled by the same time the next day. Those rewards have different names today: the first was called Fearstruck before it was destroyed

And we can’t forget their raids on the cities of the Sea Elves, bridges, and scaffoldings afloat at sea to an underground city swarming with serpents. The Atmorans raided them all, one by one, and stole from them amid chaos and violence.

There were rumors among the Sea Elves, and they agreed, but insisted that he was also gathering the fleet and that they should flee. In response, the Atmorans simply shrugged, assuming that the Sea Elves were just nuts or that maybe Orgnum had turned himself into some sort of Draugr-Mage, or that he had escaped through trickery.

***

Dreadmund’s fleet set out at dawn. The *Snow Whale*’s crew was as it had been at the beginning of this story, and Thaduga, who had all stayed behind at Smallwall, Raving Savage the Welwa, Tang Mo the Monkey-Thing, and Jahnson Whose-Name-Stays-in-its-Cradle, who had all died in agony of the poisons of local foods and creatures, for the Bird Elf

Their target was a small fishing village off of one of the northwestern islands, fish with orange and white stripes, eels, underwater birds with spearlike tails, really long fish that looked like eels or sea serpents but really weren’t, and fish that, when looked upon head-on, which were creatures with the front half of a cow and the back half of a serpent and which were said to be the cattle of either the octopus elves or the people of a Republic called Hahd. The dwellings of the village were made of coral

***

“Captain

“Cut through the islands. We don’t have all day.”

“Yes

The *Snow Whale* pushed ahead, dark, musty space made the Atmorans somber, and all was silent but for the lapping of trapped water on the bare cliffs and on the ships. The silence whispered into their ears and pulled at the edges of the splashes and the creaks of the waves and the ships, threatening to devour even those sounds.

A ship appeared ahead of the *Snow Whale*, depictions of Sun-Birds and ancestors engraved throughout, screamed of High-Elven design. The traces green-tinted wood which broke the perfect swirls and even coloring marked local repairs to the ship. A perfectly shaped leaf, alive and green, served as the sail as its stem served as the mast, like the living sails of the Wood Elves in those ships that they grow. Faded text played across the ship’s side. Dreadmund turned to his Bird Elf, which, preened its feathers and rearranged its magic beads.

“What’s that text on the ship’s side say?”

The Bird Elf squawked. “It reads

The *Pasquiniel* sliced through the stagnant waters, tones rising and falling, just as sharp and shrill and keening as every such trumpet the Atmorans had heard during their time in Pyandonea.

The Bird Elf, “They would like to speak to you, and negotiate something.”

Dreadmund grunted. “It’s probably a trap

***

As the two ships neared one another, shouted ahead. To Dreadmund, most everything of Sea-Elvish was still nothing but incoherent noises, but he did pick up one word.

“Did he say ‘Orgnum’?”

“Yes-Yes-Yes. He said that he is the King Orgnum. And that he would like to duel with you

Dreadmund frowned. “Tell him that I killed Orgnum.”

The Bird Elf babbled at the Sea Elf

“Ask him what in Hell that means.”

“He says that he is the new the King Orgnum

“Translate directly

“‘I am the King Orgnum

“Heh. What do I get out of dueling with him that I don’t get from just killing him?”

The two elves made sounds for a moment. “You shall be granted the *Pasquiniel* without resistance

A lazy smile played across Dreadmund’s face. “Odd how eager he is to be crushed. I’ll humor him. But the last Orgnum chose where he would fight me

***

Dreadmund and the second Orgnum, which he had recovered after his battle with the other Orgnum, and this new Orgnum readied his spear. The Ice Blade still hadn’t tasted a King’s blood, but maybe it would finally get its chance. Dreadmund stared into Orgnum’s eyes, and Orgnum Stared back.

Orgnum charged. Dreadmund tried to move, slowed by the Stare, for Orgnum knew it as the serpents did. A Thu’um rose from Dreadmund’s frozen throat and pushed Orgnum back, breaking eye contact and freeing Dreadmund’s movement again.

Orgnum Stared a gout of flame

Dreadmund spoke another Thu’um from the side of his mouth. It landed beside Orgnum

Or not. Orgnum shoved his spear haft in the way, dropping the shaft of his spear as Dreadmund dropped the Ice Blade. There wasn’t space to use spears and greatswords, anymore.

The two rolled across the deck, for a coincidental savior. His seeking fingers found the severed spearhead. He held it aloft and brought it down with all his strength, shoving it into Dreadmund’s chest.

Dreadmund gasped. It hurt him to breath. Orgnum stood and backed away, it burped from his side. He screamed in agony. The elf had stabbed into his lung. He Thu’umed again, and again, and as the Thu’ums burped from his side, his wound grew wider and wider. He gave up his Voice as a lost cause; his greatest power made powerless. He rose. He would not fall to this cur. He charged, howling, and made to smash Orgnum in the face, to kill him anyway. Orgnum glared daggers at Dreadmund—literally—and Dreadmund was flung back. He tore one of the daggers from his body and charged again, and Orgnum Stared at Dreadmund with such force that he flew into the *Snow Whale*’s mast and split it. Dreadmund did not rise this time.

He spoke in hissing Sea Elf tones

“He says

Dreadmund roared and rose again

Between gasps

The Bird Elf spoke

Footnotes

1 Pronounced ‘Thoom-Thanes’ by Amedee, such as Yngmir. I spelled it as ‘Thu’um’ with each mention, for the sake of adherence to accurate, or at least modern, spellings. The Thu’um is the more specific, accurate word referring to the Shouts and Voice of the Tongues of Skyrim in Skyrim’s early years.

2 The term ‘Bird Elf’ presumably indicates an Ayleid, considering that these Atmorans did not encounter the elf in Nibenay. ‘Wild Elf’ is a nonsensical title for the Atmorans to use as well, considering that this story’s setting, whether the story is historical or fictional, predates the fall of the Ayleids and their descent into ‘Wild’ness. And finally, the term ‘Ayleid’ is simply too technically correct for the Atmorans to use; to them, the elves were Snow Elves and Bird Elves and such

3 The ‘Mist-Veil’ is fairly mysterious. Different sources hold different views; it is clear that, with no indication of separation from the rest of the world. As a whole, it is clearly evident that the Maormer have some control over the mist storms that are some common in and around their land—with one source going so far as to claim that certain herbs and magicks of the Maormer made one feel like a ‘cooling mist’ during certain, ah, recreational activities—and it seems that they have traditionally used their ‘Mist-Veil’ as a barrier and an alarm system. Such a view is clearly supported by the text of Raid on Pyandonea.

Old Man Vile was feastin’

Sucking up some hapless ghosts and crunchin’ on their bones.

But Old Man Vile was greedy and his belly growled on still

for every scrap of every soul could not that belly fill.

So the Daedra frowned and stamped his foot and looked further afield.

Old Man Vile with Daedra smile went walkin’ in the Weald.

.

And there he spied with Daedra eye young Kastav at the lute.

He knew this was the soul for him

He said “here boy I see you play

But tha’rt no Daedra

Old Man Vile’s a wily one and Kastav brash in youth.

“Old Man Vile

.

“Yay very well

Play your lute and play it good and if you’re boast is true

You’ll win my lute o’ solid gold

I’ll take thy soul right back with me to roast upon my fire!”

.

“Why that lute’s fine” said Kastav brave

When my song’s best and yours is less and you win nowt at all!”

Old Vile just laughed and snapped his claws and held the lute of gold

It hissed and spat and thunder roared and Vile struck these chords bold:

.

*Instrumental*

.

“Old Man Vile I’ll tell you what

But I told you once that I’m the best and that there lute is mine!”

.

*Instrumental*

 .

With that the Daedra groaned

He roared with rage and smote the earth for he knew that he’d been beat.

Old Man Vile did not lose well

And to him came his mighty hound

The hound did growl and split apart and turned all into scamps.

Each held a lute of blackened wood and they began to dance.

.

*Instrumental*

.

And Kastav frowned and on the hill he drummed his booted feet

And the ghosts o’ Kastav’s blood cried out “By Hrol

And the Wealdmen brought their ghostly lutes and Kastav played again.

Now just like Vile instead of one

.

*Instrumental*

.

And this time even Old Man Vile had to admit defeat.

“Kastav boy

So Kastav took that lute o’ gold and said “don’t come again!

Old Man Vile you know your place

I’ve beat you once

He swung the lute and knocked the horns right off of Old Vile’s head!

.

But no prize o’ Vile’s is as it seems and Kastav didn’t know.

He was brave and rash and played that lute right then and there and lo!

Those razor strings o’ solid gold would play no mortal score.

They cut poor Kastav’s fingers off

It's commonly accepted that the last Dragonborn is the PC, he boasts how the heroes of Sovngarde looked to him to defeat Alduin. Miraak alone seems like quite a fitting candidate to take on the world eater. Power to control Alduin's forces, limitless number of shouts, a dragon rider, the power of Hermaeus Mora's wrath, the list goes on.

So something came to my mind recently. The last Dragonborn almost gets his head chopped off at the beginning of the game. Surely, Miraak is getting out of Apocrypha. From the looks of things, it seems that the tale didn't care so much for the Last Dragonborn, but more so the last living Dragonborn in the Kalpa.

As we know, you take their place. It's easier to wear the crown when the king has no head. What if Miraak was just a test for the Dragonborn, a sort of obstacle to see if the Dragonborn was strong enough for Alduin? What if Miraak was a contingency plan if things went to shit? What if Akatosh pitted these two together and let Dragon Priests be Dragon priests, just to quickly decide who was going to take the place as the last Dragonborn? Miraak has all the things needed to take down Alduin. In fact, Miraak could very well fill the role of the Dragonborn in almost every aspect (ends the civil war, finishes off the silver hand, stops the situation of the eye of Magnus, etc.). In fact

 Correct me if I'm wrong, then couldn't every single play-through be an unused idea of creation being played out, and therefore a part of Hermaeus Mora? What if each time a PC starts out on their journey, they are simply performing one of those possible unused ideas? If HM knows all knowledge of TES, then he knows all possible actions and each play through is the actualization of one course of possible actions.

And what's more than that

Because of this, we are all spending real life time learning about HM and the other Daedric Princes and this knowledge is with us as we go about our real lives. In some small way then, this knowledge becomes actualized in the real world. 

It reminds me of Neil Gaiman's ""American Gods"" where a god's power comes from those who believe in them or even just know about them. This is actually pretty close to Richard Dawkin's memetic theory that ideas are real and self-replicating. The more we know about HM and the more we dig into the lore of TES

1350866948.0,11vcrs,When the Dreamsleeve Runs Dry,Ishullanu,63,5,27," The Dreamsleeve is a difficult subject of speculation, such as in the [Mythic Dawn Commentaries](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/mythic-dawn-commentaries).The opening of those commentaries states “We mortals leave the dreaming-sleeve of birth the same, coming to near consensus that the Dreamsleeve is also returned to upon death. Here

 It is clear that not all souls go through this process of recycling and rebirth in the Dreamsleeve, endlessly switching between predator and prey on Hircine's Hunting Grounds. The other Daedric Lords are known to engage in similar agreements, sheltering mortals in their respective realms (or at least harvesting their souls in some way), over time these souls removed from the rebirth cycle will begin to add up. It is not just the Daedra that are involved with this removal from the Dreamsleeve cycle, the Nordic Sovngarde is an eternal drinking hall for the Nordic heroes if their death earns them a place there, and the Redguard's Far Shores could function in a similar way. The fact that souls are being recycled implies a finite overall supply, a supply that is being siphoned out into the daedric realms and other afterlifes, Mundus would become an empty plane of existence

If we accept these postulations on the connection of the Dreamsleeve and the continuation of the current iteration of reality, giving mortals endless opportunities to find immortality. So on the surface, attaining immortality through the power of the Aedra and Daedra appears to be the point of the cycle, giving individuals time to find which realm will hold their soul until all souls are sorted and time comes to a close. Unfortunately this view is short sighted, as this definition of immortality does not consider what transpires when the current Kalpa comes to a close. For it is clear that when the world is devoured, the mortal souls that make their home in other realms are not exempt from Alduin's hunger. As he showed when traveling to Sovngarde and feasting upon the Nord dead there within, at the end of the Kalpa all mortals will be consumed, Mundus, but a postponing of cycle of rebirth. As stated in the sermons of Vivec[ “The enlightened are those uneaten by the world”](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/thirty-six-lessons-vivec-sermon-twenty-one)

Now if it true that the collection of souls into other realms is what depletes the Dreamsleeve, glimpsing at the motivation of the Daedra and their reasons for hoarding mortal souls in their realms of Oblivion. It has been speculated that the Daedra could move past the ending of a Kalpa, since if the spheres they represent are eternal (betrayal, ambition, revolution, madness, and ect.) then the Daedra themselves are necessary to embody them forever as well. In addition to this, they could yearn for the changing in reality that comes with the end of a Kalpa. There is a distinct possibility, ferreting away as many souls as they can.

Though the Dreamsleeve continues to be frustratingly opaque, maintaining the amount of souls present throughout a Kalpa, and its drying serves as the catalyst of the world’s end, it would appear that the Dreamsleeve is one of the most important forces in existence. Is it the responsibility of mortals to keep the Dreamsleeve flowing, to ignore the temptations of the Daedra and other promises of eternal happiness, and focus on repeating the life/death cycle until  enlightenment can be reached? Or is the drying of the Dreamsleeve a natural phenomena, and mortals should embrace whatever afterlife they wish until the Kalpa comes to a close?",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/11vcrs/when_the_dreamsleeve_runs_dry/

Tenet 1: Never dishonour the Night Mother. To do so is to invoke the Wrath of Sithis.

Tenet 2: Never betray the Dark Brotherhood or its secrets. To do so is to invoke the Wrath of Sithis.

Tenet 3: Never disobey or refuse to carry out an order from a Dark Brotherhood superior. To do so is to invoke the Wrath of Sithis.

Tenet 4: Never steal the possessions of a Dark Brother or Dark Sister. To do so is to invoke the Wrath of Sithis.

Tenet 5: Never kill a Dark Brother or Dark Sister. To do so is to invoke the Wrath of Sithis.

Since the second era, and perhaps some who were not so innocent. But, what happened to this organisation of legend? Since the beginning of the 4th era, the cult has drifted away into a thing of legends. Now at the coming of the dragons, it was as if they no longer existed, until the death of the emperor. I hope to explain how the Old Dark Brotherhood completed its final contract… itself.

First, and an entire sanctuary sacrificed to Sithis to ensure any traitors are killed. I believe the fall of the Dark Brotherhood is simply purification on a massive scale.

The end began during the final years of the third era, a speaker for the cult, murdered Bellamont’s mother, creating within Bellamont a deep hatred for the assassins. The idea of revenge built up inside of him, until he eventually came up with his plan to destroy the one who gave the order for his mother’s death: The Night Mother.

Bellamont joined the cult and rose up the ranks. He created masses of paranoia within the cult by getting assassins killed, the Silencer was confronted by Lucien Lachance, who told him about the jobs being switched. After finding the lair of Bellamont, but still unbeknownst that that he was the traitor, The Silencer returned to Lachance, only to find him dead. Bellamont convinced three other speakers and the Silencer to go with him to Bravil, where the Night Mothers tomb was. Here, murdering two of the speakers and attempting to kill the Night Mother. He was instead killed by the Silencer.
These events are what started the downfall of the Dark Brotherhood. With many of the Black Hand dead, more importantly, Sithis’ wrath was incurred. Bellamont broke all 5 of the tenets in his betrayal, leaving a dark mark upon the Brotherhood. He dishonoured The Night Mother by attempting to kill her immortal body, he betrayed The Dark Brotherhood by causing the death of members of the Black Hand, he replaced jobs given to the Silencer and therefore indirectly disobeyed orders and in this way he also stole The Silencer from the Brotherhood. Finally he killed many Dark Brothers and Sisters. 

Sithis and The Night Mother knew that this sort of betrayal could easily occur again and that to ensure the Dark Brotherhood could be great once more; it had to be destroyed and rebuilt via the purification of every Dark Brotherhood sanctuary.

The 3 main ways the Dark Brotherhood was eliminated were: The Great War, including every base in Hammerfell and Black Marsh. The Night Mother most likely did not cause the Great war, but instead did not protect the sanctuaries in anyway and allowed them to be destroyed. The destruction and evacuation of so many sanctuaries eventually led to Black Hand becoming divided. Some wished to expand the Brotherhood, whereas others wanted to protect what few sanctuaries were left. Neither side understood that the Brotherhood’s days were numbered, and that nothing could prevent the will of Sithis and the Night Mother. 

In 4E 187 only 4 sanctuaries remained: the Cheydinhal Sanctuary in Cyrodiil, and the Falkreath Sanctuary in Skyrim. The Wayrest sanctuary was destroyed by Corsairs, and the Corinthe sanctuary was evacuated to Cheydinhal. The Falkreath sanctuary abandoned the other sanctuaries, believing that the other sanctuaries were doomed, and only a new Brotherhood not bound by Tenets and the Night Mother’s will could survive. When only one member of the Cheydinhal sanctuary remained, the keeper of the Night Mother, Cicero, knowing that the Falkreath sanctuary had given up on the old ways. The Night Mother drove Cicero insane with her silence

By the Night Mother’s will, thereby sealing her own fate, as well as the fate of her Sanctuary. The Blade of Woe she possesses is most likely stolen from another Dark Brother or Sister. She then dishonoured the Night Mother, by at first ignoring her order to seek out Amaund Motierre. This also broke the 3rd Tenet, by ignoring an order from her superior, the Listener. She broke Tenets 2 and 5 by betraying the listener to Commander Maro, and trying to get them killed. Commander Maro finishes off the Falkreath sanctuary, by killing Astrid after the attack

Or

&gt; what in the Aurbis makes the Prisoner such a powerful mythic figure?

 To understand the importance of the Prisoner

According to [Vehk's Teaching](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/tower)

The Tower is the fourth constellation, prisoners, secrets to apotheosis, all things a Thief would be interested in. The Thief could be any average J'oe born under a certain star, seeking enlightenment, trying to break into the Tower. 

The Prisoner, whose fate is their own to decide. They have the potential to become a ruling king, due to their freedom from the stars. 

If CHIM is a walking path (out of the godhead, then we could say that the Prisoner is imprisoned within reality.

 Escaping the tower means that the Prisoner is seeking freedom from reality. Escapism. Fantasy. We are all Prisoners. 

But the Prisoner knows reality exists, other than the one they choose through their actions.

The Prisoner is the Thief

1360344956.0,1853lh,A Look at Vvardenfells Noteworthy Creatures,Undoer,64,10,26,"I'll just start off by saying: This is all written in character

**A Look at Vvardenfells Noteworthy Creatures by Arnand Duvier.**

First, currently in the employ of the Mages Guild of Tamriel. I am the author of many books, essays, and articles on the indigineous species of Vvarndfel, such as “Cliff Racers And How To Avoid Them” and “The Observed Relationships Between Kagouti And Alit”. During my most recent excursion to Vvardenfell I came across some very bewildered tourists in both awe and fear of the wild life which they'd never seen before on Tamriel, it was then that I decided to do two things: Firstly, join them in unadvancing towards the angered Betty Netch and secondly

**Alit**

I shall, and we shall start with the aforementioned “Alit”. The Alit is a two legged creature in appearance with razor sharp teeth that dominative the mouth of the beast, which in turn dominates the body. The Alit appears to be a cumbersome and slow creature, but in actual fact can reach high speeds and catch even the most seasoned researcher by surprise. Due to it's lack of forelegs it attacks prey primarily with it's teeth and maintains good balance whilst attacking, despite it's appearance. 

The hide of the Alit can be tanned to make a tough leather, and elixirs.

Alit's are frequently found around the grasslands of Vvardenfell and the Ashlands.

**Cliff Racer**

Perhaps one of the most infamous creatures of Vvardenfell is the Cliff Racer, 13th of Last Seed) Cliff Racers are still in positively frightful quantity. 

The most impressive feature of the Cliff Racer is the length of the wing span, which is presumably used to maintain balance whilst flying, or potentially whilst hunting, since the creature appears to be carnivorous.

The Cliff Racers plumes are often found available in the Imperial City's many market places

**Guar**

Guar are the pack animals of Vvardenfell, such as their very strong back legs which support the entire body, and their large heads which dominate much of the creatures appearance. In contrast to the Alit, Guar are herbivorous, and easily trained to serve the native Dunmer rather than hostile, this is probably due to the beasts rows of razor sharp teeth. 

The Guar is easily distinguished from the Alit by several huge differences: Primarily, secondly it has seemingly useless but rather interesting small arms, and thirdly it has a long thick tail protruding out of the creatures nether regions. 

The Guars thick hide can be tanned into a leather that is frequently found all over the Empire. These hides a major export of Vvardenfell. Ashlander tribes have been known to farm packs of Guar

Guars can be found all over Vvardenfell

**Kagouti**

Kagouti are the Alit's stronger brother

The Kagouti, presumably preying on the herbivorous creatures found around the area. 

The main difference between Kagouti and Alit are the tusks which protrude forward from where cheeks would be on a Man or Mer and the two sharp fangs rather than lines of fearsome teeth. This may sound preferable, to be caught by a charging Kagouti. The Kagouti's charging abilities are aided by an eye ridge that allows it to charge without fear of damaging it's eyes. 

Similarly to it's brothers, the Guar, the Kagouti also has a valuable hide, but it is in shorter supply than Alit and Guar hides due to the Kagouti's significantly more ferocious and dangerous nature. The hide is said to be tough and valuable leather for fittings and armours.

**Kwama**

On my journeys around Vvardenfell I once met a miner, and I was right, much to my surprise the man explained that he, like most Miners on Morrowind, mined for Kwama Eggs, a staple of the Dunmer diet. There are many subspecies of Kwama, ranging from small slug like Foragers to the great queens. Kwama Eggs are used in a vast range of dishes due to their size and abundance

The Forager, a small slug like creature with a beak and three black, menacing, evil eyes. I shudder to think about the beast, and as I write this I figuratively tremble (If I trembled no one would be able to read my writing) as I think of the 'Kwama Cuttle' which the Forager produces at alarming quantities. It is a thick waxy substance that is produced from the Kwama's beak and has modest magical properties such as a resistance to poisons.

The Kwama Scrib is the larval form of Kwama, unduly aggressive for it's size, and, unlike the Forager, produces a weak Paralysis Poison from within it's body.

The Kwama Worker is one of the species few non-aggressive subspecies, a number of legs befitting most non-sentient beings. 

The Warrior is my personal least favourite form of Kwama. It is aggressive, such as researchers and miners. The Warrior excels at it's job using it's powerful front arms which can shatter wood, bones, and the resolve of Bretons. 

The Queen is the central figure of the mine, is not hostile in it's nature, and will not attack anyone unless attacked, but it is heavily guarded by the dutiful Kwama Warriors which are not quite as welcoming to visitors, regardless of how important a blood sample is. 

**Netch**

Netch are the main cattle of civilized Vvardenfell and are a magnificent sight to see. The Bull (Male) Netch is the larger of the two very different genders and has a thick hide that covers a sack of jellyish substance known as the “Float Sack”. The Float sack

The female, and has an external float sack that moves with the Netch. The Betty Netch is much smaller and lighter skinned compared to the Bull.

Whilst in the wild Netch herd in ratios of 1 Betty and up-to 8 Bull

Some Bull Netch have known to display poisonous qualities when threatened by prey

Netch are farmed for their valuable leather which surpasses Guar Leather in it's quality. 

**Nix Hounds**

Nix Hounds are canine predators who hunt in packs all over Vvardenfell. Whilst the Nix Hound is quite large (and one of the few quadrupedal creatures on Vvardenfell) it lacks a strong way of attacking it's prey

The only valuable part of the Nix Hound is the meat

**Shalk**

Shalk are insects which can be found on Vvardenfell's grasslands and ashlands. The shalk is said to be very resistant to fire

Shalk have been known

The only valuable part of the Shalk is the resin which the Shalk produces which when ingested properly can assist in the healing of wounds

**Silt Striders**

Silt Striders are enormous insect like anthropods with six long thing legs (seemingly ending points) and two long thin arms

Silt Striders are not an aggressive animal, along with any goods, and from personal experience I would like to note that one should not wear ones best robes when travelling by Silt Strider.

This researcher also notes that the Silt Strider Caravaneer by the name ""Selvil Sareloth"" is not to be trusted with valuables

**Wolves**

I'm sure many readers, and an ordinary hunter would be surprised to learn of the lack of Deer, Bears, Wolves, Large Cats, and even ordinary Birds (I blame the Cliff Racers). Vvardenfell has a landscape that is incredibly alien compared to Cyrodiil, Skyrim, Hammerfell

I speculate that Wolves are either taken from the borders of mainland Morrowind,False,,t5_2t5ay,1360404081.0,,Telvanni,t3_1853lh
1357672527.0,1675ca,Daedric Armour light emission research,Chieftah,63,7,51,"I am currently doing a research about Daedric Armour and abilities. The currently known info includes this: Ebony, buried in the lava flows from Red Mountain. Veins can also be found in Solstheim, said to be the crystallized blood of the gods. It is protected by Imperial law
The ore has several alchemical properties and is often smelted into ebony ingots for use in smithing. Ebony armor is made by repeatedly folding the ore upon itself to form strips, binding a daedra to the object by use of a process known only to the denizens of Oblivion. Exceptionally skilled smiths can create daedric armor by throwing a daedric heart into melted ebony under a lunar phenomenon, with the harvest moon being the best time to do so. (from UESP)

So


Why the armour glows? In my researches, in which the gas state material molecules start spinning much more faster than in normal gas state (though the distance between them barely differs) and start to emit light (energy). Now my idea would be that some places in daedric armour are filled with a material (probably a daedra heart or some of it's parts) which is able to reach plasma state without any additional heating source. How is that possible? Is it completely a magickal thing or not? My theory would be that the material is being heated by itself since it's a daedra heart. Probably, if you take out the right material from the daedra heart, which normally keeps its energy in a certain volume, when placed in an empty place inside the armour, it (100% separated raw one material) emits more energy when mixed and contained within the heart. If the strange material is D, then m/f would be density of our material, or m/V=p (can't find ro on my PC). When we know the right material

1350322057.0,11iqga,The Time God Conspiracy,regalnerd,64,6,46,"My friends I believe I have either stumbled upon the grand conspiracy that Nu-Hatta spoke of in the Intercept

[Conjecture](/g ""In the main games the various aspects of the Time God have been attempting to undue what the Selectives did when they danced on the tower."")

**Red Mountain and Azura.**

The destruction of the Numidium marks the start of the conspiracy

Now as we all know the Nerevarine was sent by Azura to remove the Tribunal's divinity and thus obtain her revenge on them, and her sphere relates to the passing of Time. Because of this I believe Azura to be one of the many Time God aspects (I stopped counting how many there were a long time ago)

Azura, As Divayth Fyr said “Azura, he said, knew and understood all things, and declined to speak of these things, or only spoke in riddles.” I suggest that this was absolutely no problem to her, as she wished to be reunited with her mirror-twins, both the deactivation of Red Tower and the end of the Tribunal.

**The Oblivion Crisis.**

This is where the conspiracy gets really good. I should have just titled this part “Hermaeus Mora is a glorious bastard.”

So again as we all know the Oblivion Crisis happened when the Mythic Dawn assassinated Emperor Uriel Septim VII and his Heirs, a book written by Dagon himself.

Lets see what some experts on Daedra have to say about Dagon.

From [Varieties of Daedra](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/varieties-daedra) we have a quote from Divayth Fyr himself.

&gt; Mehrunes Dagon, fixity of purpose, and a predictable lack of subtlety in thought, knew nothing and understood nothing, and was inclined to speak freely and without falsehood. 

And from [Interview with two denizens of the Shivering Isles](http://www.imperial-library.info/node/2234) we have this quote from Haskill.

&gt; Or with Mehrunes Dagon. Do not speak his name to me again. The Master of Scum. The pawn of every Prince of true power

According to these two reputable sources, he needs someone to unleash him, and that somebody was Hermaeus Mora. 

Note the name of the holy book of the Mythic Dawn, and it was Mora who gave the knowledge to Xarxes. And as we have seen in Skyrim he has no problem giving people false info if it means furthering his goals.

Mora, because in his own words “Past, Present, and Future are all as one to me.”

So now we have a full third of the known towers deactivated in a short period of time by aspects of the Time God. That brings us to the modern age.

**Post Crisis**

Almost immediately after the Crisis the Mane of Elseweyr was assassinated, and work to unbind him and the entirety of Mundus. This brings the total of confirmed deactivated towers to 6, with 3 confirmed being deactivated by Aspects of the Time god and 2 suspected. The only aspect that has shown an interest in prolonging Mundus and the Kalpa is Akatosh, we see this in the Monomyth, specifically Shezzar's Song, where the pro-mundus Aedra are led by Akatosh, while the anti-mundus Aedra are led by Auri-El.

That brings us to Skyrim, neither want to see Mundus unbound, Aka because he loves this Kalpa and Alduin because he wishes to rule it.) And then of course in Dawnguard you can choose to hinder the influence of Auri-El with the blood cursed arrows. So far I have seen no good evidence to suggest that Snow-Throat has been deactivated, so I presume that it is still active. This leaves three towers still active.

Snow-Throat.

Adamantine.

Orichalc.

Before anyone murders me about including Orichalc I would ask you read these lines from Lord Vivec's Sword Meeting With Cyrus the Restless.

&gt; True stories had come that Yokus still lived among the stark remains; that some did not or could not flee when cataclysm came; others that the orichalc isles were a place of censure handed down from the no-totambu. And everyone knew the self-exiled ansu still lived there who did not witness the ho no shira, and so were left to the sword-singing of their histories behind the Curtain of Run. 

The Islands that remain of Yokuda are called the Orichalc Isles

Imperial Mananauts have verified that his influence on fate and time is real and unfeigned, implications of which tie this Prince directly with Akatosh, chief of the Nine Divines. Since Akatosh is the prime temporal spirit whose appearance led to the formation of the world, perhaps Hermaeus Mora speaks the truth. Nevertheless, it is the will of His Majesty Uriel VII that only on the official holiday of 5th First Seed should any propitiation to this Daedric Prince be delivered. “All else is mutation.”

1358809263.0,170nio,The Worth of the Soul: The Subtext of a Dragon’s Duel ,Ishullanu,57,5,14,"
It is often said that when two dragons engage in battle, a novice of these subjects seeing only the surface level of these conflicts, the waves of flame, frost, and pure entropy spilling forth from the dragon’s maw. As knowledge of the mechanism behind these powers increases, realizing each one of these great powers is linked to specific words of power and fueled by the deepest essence of the dragon itself, the literal label of debate seems wholly fitting. 

 Though, how are the clashes between dragons to be considered true debates when the vocabulary of power words in each individual contention rarely reaches more than the same few words repeated again and again? Which brings about another consideration, if these debates so often play out in the same way with similar wording, what is the subject being argued? 

 To address these concerns, supported by evidence, and appealing towards the subjects intellect. Here it is the objective content of the words that is the barometer for truth, and many words are delicately chosen and arranged to try to make them fit the context of the discussion. To a dragon, such context and subtlety is irrelevant. Individual words are known to have power in of themselves, they need not be prettied up through long drawn out sentences, they merely are paired with the few other words most fitting and said with true conviction. 

Indeed, the power found in understanding the real meaning of even the simplest concept, these are what each side is presenting. While Men and Mer seek to convince through building elaborate structures of words, concepts upon concepts interwoven together impressively, the dragons’ discourse reaches towards something profoundly baser. The appeal to emotions is not only encouraged, it is the only important aspect of the dispute, the shouter is attempting to show their adversary how deeply they feel the words they speak and through their Thu’um they make the other dragon feel it too. Still, they are but the filters through which the dragon conveys what is actually being discussed

 A dragon’s soul is immortal, with the end goal of convincing their opponent that they are more worthy of possessing their soul. When the soul travels from one dragon to another, it does so willingly, it has not been trapped but has been shown this is the best thing for it to do, it is better to be a part of this greater soul than to exist on its own as an inferior. This has to do with the dragon’s inbred need to dominate; their willingness to become an aspect of another soul is within character as long that soul has demonstrated it has the ability to control. So the debate of the dovah is not some petty squabble of what trivial facts are true or false, but it is a measuring of each other’s spirit and attempting to determine who possesses a soul worthy to envelope the others.

There will be 4 individual categories including 1 best of the best award which are:

* **Best apocrypha**

Apocrypha is a term we use to describe the writings of fans designed to expand upon the lore of the Elder Scrolls universe. It denotes those fan creations executed with technical skill and a dedication to the creation of an organismic

* **Best explanation**

The difference between a good explanation and a good apocrypha is that apocrypha seeks to expand the lore whilst the other seeks to explain the Lore.

* **Most helpful answer/reply to a question**
* **Scholar of the year**

and

* **Best submission** (this can be anything that you deem 'best')

-----------------

In order to get everything organised please post your nominations (you cannot nominate yourself only others) for each category. Make a separate post for each category you wish to nominate for in order for the best of each category to get upvoted. Voting/nominations will close on the 26th and the top 3 for each category will be subjected to a 4/5 day poll. Upvote anything and everything which you agree with

For the nominations only upvotes will be counted and any/all downvotes will be discounted. Also please do not look to the 'Most upvoted' posts to make your decision for you.

1362600477.0,19smmy,"On the marriage practices of Morrowind, and some notes on the institution of slavery in Morrowind",FrankManic,60,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/19smmy/on_the_marriage_practices_of_morrowind_and_some/, and the spirits of Vvardenfell to witness and approve the marriage. Elves are very long lived, bandits

Important life stages are likely marked by becoming proficient with weapons and magic. The Magribrash suggest that women are acknowledged as being potential fighting wizards. Likewise the hazards of the ashlands and the rough equality of men and women

Pre-marriage rituals likely include exchange of gifts – clothing, blankets, magical scrolls or spells, guars, nix, shalk, various household goods, that is to give a gift of gold. For serious occaisions it is considered important to show respect by learning about the recipient and offering a gift that will be suitable to their temperment

Additonally a visit to the ancestor tombs of the various Dunmeri families seems likely, or daedric shrines. 

The ceremony itself is likely brief, some sort of formula between representatives of each person's family, 

Redoran

Likely the most 'tradtional' of the great houses. Probably shares many characteristics with Indoril and Dren nobility. Likely viewed as a meeting of families, and perhaps a ranking member of the Redoran formal structure. It seems likely that Nerevar and Almalexia would stand as the model for the ideal Dunmer marriage. Though given how that marriage ended it would be somewhat ironic. The presence of an ancestor ghost would likely depend on the degree to which the individuals present followed ancestor worship practices. More likely for the Redoran, less likely for Indoril. And Dren, being somewhat difficult to know away on the border of Argonia, cannot be commented on. 

The event itself likely involves a visit to the local Tribunal temple or shrine where the marriage is witnessed by AlmSiVi and approved by the House representative. This would likely be followed by a reception and a party. Redorans being Redorans this would likely serve as a time to meet and reaffirm featly and comittment to Redoran. 

Indoril – Indoril being strongly committed to the Tribunal, more formal, and less accepting of any western or pre-AlmSiVi influence. 

Telvanni – It would seem that Telvanni practices are as wildly distinctive as the Telvanni themselves. It's commonly known that the only time the Telvanni pay attentiont to anything outside fireball range is if they believe it's a threat to themselves, behind the door marked ""Beware of Vermai"") and of Tribunal temples (there aren't any) demonstrate the disinterest of the Telvanni in religious matters. A marriage is unlikely to involve anything beyond the agreement of the principles. If there is significant property or prestige involved the local Wizard Lord or a representative might be requested to witness and keep track of any marriage document. Beyond that there is likely to be a party of some sort. It seems likely that a Telvanni celebration would be quite a sight, providing the wizards a chance to show off some of their flashier magic or to summon otherworldly entertainment. It would also serve as an excuse for families to visit each other, travelling between isolated Telvanni townships and holds. 

Hlallu – the Hlallu are most likely to adopt western practices. It would not be surprising if a Hlallu wedding involved an edgy Tribunal witness standing alongside a priestess of the Nine Divines. The Hlallu houses are notable for being more competitive than members of the other great houses; it seems more likely that attention would be paid to a marriage contract. It is also likely that Hlallu would seek to adopt trends and fashions from other parts of Tamriel

Commoners – Commoner weddings are fairly unpretenious affairs. A journey to the Tribunal temple to seek the witness of AlmSiVi, the party being the most notable aspect. 

Slaves – The Dren and Telvanni are the primary slaveholders on Morrowind. The manner in which the two houses hold slaves is distinctive. The Dren hold large numbers of slaves as field and plantation workers. Dren slaves perform a great deal of the agricultural work of southern Morrowind. Comparitively the Dren slave is less likely to be well treated. Dren slaves are traded more frequently, frequently of overwork or illness. The majority of Telvanni slaves work in or around the house or compound. It's hard to generalize with Telvanni, and they do have many field slaves. In a very general sense, however, Telvanni slaves are better off than Dren slaves. The large number of magicians and wizards make health care less expensive. Telvanni are also much less likely to trade slaves. A given slave family will likely live under a single Telvanni master their entire life. 
Telvanni slaves are much more likely than Dren slaves to engage in some craft or trade and the Telvanni generally allow their slaves to keep the procedes of their trade. 

Slavery under the Telvanni, in not a friendly, at least a tolerant relationship with their masters. It helps somewhat that the Telvanni wizard-lords are as disinterested in their slaves as they are in most everything except magic and intriguing. The dispassionately practical Telvanni often ensure their Slaves relative comfort for the simple reason that it's less trouble to keep them happy than to hunt down escapees and put down revolts. It is notable that men and mer will occaisionally sell themselves into slavery in a Telvanni household. For those who are poor but have some craft or an intellect that makes them valuable to the Telvanni this is a way of securing food and shelter. This sort of slave is somewhere between a dependent and a valuable posession.",,False,,t5_2t5ay,,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/19smmy/on_the_marriage_practices_of_morrowind_and_some/

1360651191.0,18d5h5,Quick piece on Khajiit and the Aldmeri Dominion,Mr_Flippers,61,9,23,"Right

First, with the earliest being 16 individual kingdoms in the land of Elsweyr somewhere in the First or Merethic era; all of which are turned to rubble and long gone, many beneath that sands of Anequina (refraining from proper terms for simplicity). Khajiit know leaders come and go, unless they will directly affect them right in their face, who cares? they will not keep Elsweyr forever, no one has or ever will.

You also have to understand that the Empire has been rough on Elsweyr. They:

* Take Leyawiin

* Tiber Septim just takes Rimmen's land and uses it for the Numidium's rebuilding

* Possibly outlaw Moon Sugar, Skooma is dangerous to Khajiit too, but only one town, Rimmen IIRC, has ever tried to ban it once. It's their right to mess themselves up)

* Have citizens who look down upon Khajiit more harshly than other races

Khajiit and authority are also a tricky thing. I liken the image to Khajiit and authority as two figures holding hands and slapping each other at the same time. For simplicity's sake in this quick post

Anyway, what happens? Void Nights.

Now, Jone and Jode don't even *exist* (at the time). Beyond Jone and Jode isn't just space/Aetherius/Oblivion, beyond Jone and Jode is AHNURR. The god who one-hit killed Fadomai and is still pissed so much he shook the very universe itself and he's still angry. That sounds like a damn fine reason to be scared to me.

Not only that, but the most commonly accepted idea is that it resulted in stillbirths for two years. That's rather worrying, your whole race dieing off because you cant procreate.

Then who comes to save the day? Not the Empire, but also protection of Nirn and purpose for Khajiit again.

Now that's no reason to go up and join them, restores the two ancient kingdoms Anequina and Pelletine, then helps Khajiit leave the Empire for a group that's actually been helping them. Now Elsweyr is more unified (probably as unified as it's ever going to realistically get [EDIT: without stuffing up soon]) and is, without a doubt, wealthier in both cash and culture.

The Aldmeri Dominion are actually looking like pretty good guys here, they're the only ones who are making Elsweyr prosper.

1356801676.0,15mp5k,"Concerning a certain Dragon in Blackreach
CONJECTURE",16,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/15mp5k/concerning_a_certain_dragon_in_blackreach/,"Preface: 
As some of you may know

Vulthuryol's name in the Dragon Language translates to ""Dark Overlord Fire""; this provides the largest insight into the the creature's nature. ""Dark"" obviously corresponds to the dragon's location in Blackreach. It is uncommon for a name in the Dragon Tongue to refer to anything but the dragon itself. In other words, it makes ""thur"" or ""overlord"" doubly interesting. What exactly is Vulthuryol the overlord of? The most obvious answer is Blackreach and its denizens. This is enforced by the fact that neither the dragon, nor the creatures of the abyss are hostile to one another. On the surface, when any other dragon lands, it is immediately targeted by any and all creatures on the ground, including all varieties of Chaurus (this can be observed in the swamps east of Solitude, where leveled Chauruses will spawn). So we have the fact that Vulthuryol is the Overlord of Dark Blackreach. ""Yol"" is likely a reference to the dragon's entrance; after being summoned, breathing fire

One of the most interesting things about Vulthuryol is just how obscure he is. His name does not appear in the ""Atlas of Dragons"" in Sky Haven Temple, as he was one the very few who escaped death at the hands of humans. This is enforced by the fact that there is no Dragon Burial Mound in Blackreach. 

Vulthuryol's location is bizarre as well. There is no possible way to gain entrance into Blackreach without possessing an Attunement Sphere, or managed to find some other way in. 

So what does all of this mean? Is Vulthuryol an outcast? Or are his motives just different from those of the other dragons? Does he seek to raise an army of Falmer and attack the surface, and finally Vulthuryol is planning to raise an army from the abyss and aid the Falmer as they retake the surface world.

1349675222.0,114j54,The Handless Mage,Ishullanu,61,11,49,"(Though the following thoughts are extrapolated mostly from in game observation on how mortals use magicka

When observing a spell being cast, then magicka is visibly expelled from and directed by the hand. This is often coupled with some sort of broad gesture or intricate finger movements (this does not include the power of the Nordic Thu’um, which is believed to be a gift granted by either Kynareth or Akatosh, is accomplished by different processes, and does not seem connected to an individual’s magicka pool). The hands may well be necessary for channeling internal power, shaping raw magicka into the spell and focusing it like a lens. If this is true, removal of hands could result in the metaphysical castration of the mage, but where death would be deemed as unnecessarily cruel.

Now the suggestion that something as mundane as amputation could affect something as extraordinary as magical ability may seem implausible

But there could also be ways to circumvent this disability, and it could be entirely impossible to be a true spellcaster this way, likely being limited to abilities currently known to be attainable through words of power.

With enough arcane authority and knowledge, which in turn would move to shape the mage's magicka further. The precedent here being ghosts and spirits, without physical limbs of there own, still being able to project their will through ethereal representations of extremities they used to possess. 

The link between what lies at the end of our arms and the forces we can project beyond them is apparent, removing a wizard’s reliance on the physical and creating a more direct involvement of one’s own spirit in controlling the flow of magicka. Unfortunately these theories exist in the hypothetical, and the magical potential of the Handless Mage will remain a mystery unless some brave and curious scholars choose to engage in empirical testing.

*Welcome back to the eighth volume of 'On the Species of Tamriel'. This volume deals with one of the strangest races on Nirn, but to the entirety of Tamriel. Even though this is a relative small addition to 'On the Species', it is instrumental in further understanding the Argonians.*

The Hist are probably the most secretive and hardest to understand race on Tamriel, who are extremely defensive over the trees, they are instrumental in the history of Tamriel.

There are not many noteworthy biological traits of the Hist. Indeed, there are examples of Hist being slightly shorter than the trees of Valenwood, albeit being more spread out. The largest Hist is in Lilmoth, Black Marsh, and is seen as the most important one, even though this is a pure mortal distinction, as all Hists are linked together via their roots, and share the same mind. This also attributes to the incredible knowledge (even of previous Kalpa's) the Hists have, as these are absorbed in the hive mind
Furthermore, as it is not only the only way for the Hist to comunnicate with any non-Hist, but it also what gives argonians their shape, form, sentience and soul.  
Pinpointing any features other than these is virtually impossible, and increasing it's adaptability.

The origin of the Hist is unknown to us. What is known, they were the first inhabitants of Nirn, even before the Ehlnofey. Along with Nirn, the Hists also had a realm of Oblivion of their own, the name lost to us, along with relatives of them (called the Um-Hist) inhabiting the realm of Clavicus Vile. During the Ehlnofey war, the realm of the Hist was mostly destroyed, despite their neutrality.

This neutrality is something common to the Hist. Because of their huge intelligence, neutrality is a very short sighted term, as the Hist will interfere in one way or the other, if they themselves are at risk.  
Even though the Hist are all linked, who split themselves off of the hive mind. When this happens, the other Hist team up, and destroy the rogue Hist, one way or the other.

As stated earlier, and that they were the first inhabitants of Nirn. their realm got destroyed during the Ehlnofey wars, despite their neutrality.  
It is safe to say that at almost all major events in Black Marsh, the Hist had already been calling back Argonians for years, to condition them for the impending dangers, making them better fighters, and more durable to the horrors of the Deadlands of Mehrunes Dagon. This was successful, and caused Dagon to order all gates in Black Marsh closed. This also further strengthened the position of the An-Xileel, a political party in Black Marsh which acted as the Hist's lieutenants. With the support of the Hist, making it the first province to do so.

*These strange trees of Black Marsh are indeed one of the more curious races of Tamriel, in turn, for the whole of Nirn. A basic understanding of these magnificent creatures is necessary to further understand the Argonians, with who the next volume will deal.*

Within the bleak and barren climate of the Ashlands, where the dust blows across the landscape, that the concept of 'tradition' is emphasized perhaps more so than anywhere else on Tamriel. Honor is their currency. Ritual is their lifeblood. But what happens when an Ashlander chooses to break with that tradition, not only to forsake the Ashlander way of life in favor of another, but to abandon an important position within the tribe and break the taboos that such people hold sacred?

Ashlander society is governed by a strict tribal hierarchy, gender plays an extremely important role. It should be said that the extent at which these rules are enforced within a tribe is by no means uniform amongst the Ashlanders. Much depends on a specific tribe's traditions, the discretion of the local Ashkhan, and any extraneous circumstances. The Ashlanders, after all, are nothing if not adaptable. 

An Ashlander's gender imports a series of traditions the individual must follow, cannot become warriors, or serve in the Ashkhan's retinue (known as Gulkhans amongst the Ashlanders.) Likewise, the position of Wise Woman is an exclusively female role. Amongst the Ashlanders, the Wise Woman is a repository of culture and traditional knowledge, serving as equal parts councilor, storyteller, who may take on several other Wise Women as her apprentices. The Ashkhan, however, or engaging in duels to defend the tribe's honor. As such

As one can see, should not be misconstrued to view all Ashlanders as incapable of equity amongst the sexes.  Quite differently, many Ashlanders hold the women of the tribe in great respect. The position of Wise Woman is considered an important and vital one, and many times women are treated with the same courtesy and respect as men, especially amongst the northern tribes. However, one cannot generalize such attributes of respect either. There exist a number of cases where things are quite the opposite.

Amongst the more warlike bands, the position of all women in such tribes is held below that of the men, especially the Ashkhan and the Gulkhans. In such tribes, abuse and slave-like conditions are commonplace. The Wise Women are often exempt from the worse of this (many suspect this to be due to possible traditions of chastity surrounding the position of Wise Woman.) Still, to see the members of her clan beaten, raped and humiliated can be too much for the proud Ashlander to bare. Some say that it is out of such an environment that a Mabrigash is born.

Mabrigash (The term is often used for both the singular and plural forms) are the Witch-Warriors of Ashlander legend. They are Wise Women who have abandoned their position within a tribe and forsaken the traditional rules of conduct. They break the provisional taboos preventing a Wise Woman from wielding weapons, while retaining the Wise Woman’s proficiency in both the alteration and rejuvenation colleges of magic. Ashlander magic, and by extent Mabrigash magic, differs from western magic significantly, in that Ashlanders emphasize a combination of charms and incantations that strengthen their user, while opting to wield curses that damages the life force of their target directly, rather than using the elemental magics of destruction. Mabrigash have delved deep into the study of these curses more so than any normal Wise Woman, they drain from their bodies through the use of the Ghost Snake

To break with a tribe and become a Mabrigash is no simple event. Ashlander society knows only two forms of punishment for trespass; banishment and death. The punishment for a Wise Woman practicing the dark arts is normally death, and the tribes want nothing to do with the fearsome witch-women. As such, and uneasy truce is often forged, with neither group explicitly bothering the other without provocation. 

The Mabrigash draw exclusively from the ranks of Wise Women, but it is more reasonable to assume that a number of them were full-fledged Wise Women who took issue with the way a tribe was being run by a disrespectful Ashkhan. Whatever their reason for become Mabrigash may be, the change is a definitive and irrevocable one, for once a woman becomes a Mabrigash, there is no turning back. The point at which a Wise Woman becomes a Mabrigash is usually pinpointed at their first use of the Ghost Snake, signifying a full break with the tribal ways, but it is unknown how the Mabrigash themselves what constitutes a ‘real’ Mabrigash. Mabrigash will often arrange themselves into small groups, and are known to camp near roads and tribal settlements

To outsiders, lumping them in with a series of diverse magic-users with a penchant for stealing traveler’s clothes would be a grave mistake. The variances between more common Western magic and Ashlander magic, as illustrated above, mark a key difference between the two. Mabrigash, like all other Ashlanders, also abstain from the conjuration of spirits, which is considered profane in Velothi culture. It is unclear whether the Mabrigash are capable of enlisting the same level of voluntary support from their ancestor-spirits as their Wise Women cousins, while many witches may seek out and target men with their abilities for personal reasons

The method by which a Mabrigash drains the vital essence of her target is known as the Ghost Snake.  The exact nature of the Ghost Snake is unknown; it is a closely guarded secret amongst the Mabrigash, or if it is simple one part of a greater ritual. Some rumors link it with an almost religious significance amongst Mabrigash, going so far as to suggest the Ghost Snake is actually a representation of some deity (Boethia, perhaps,) but again, this is extreme speculation. What is known, due to careful documentation, their very life force, but both are theorized to simply be variations on the same technique. The fast acting method directly paralyzes the target, like the fast form

Through the collection of firsthand accounts from lucky (or unlucky, one is able to piece together the sensation of what it feels like to be on the receiving end of the Ghost Snake. At first, when the paralysis takes hold, the body feels as if it is on fire, with the sensation of spasms and seizure coursing through the body, despite the fact that the person cannot actually move. As this continues, the physical energy of the man begins to wane, and then is turned into bile and poison. The sensation is akin to being on the receiving end of one the mystical poisons employed commonly by many mages throughout Tamriel, but at this point the man is so incredibly weak that they are often unable to move. The energy for action is removed from the body

All of these descriptions are notable for the fact that they come exclusively from outside observers, not using writing as a way of recording information. Interviewing a Mabrigash directly presents many problems due to their hostile nature, but it is not unheard of for a person to be able talk with a Mabrigash and live. When asked about their way of life, Mabrigash have a tendency to be tight-lipped. They too say that only women are able to use the Ghost Snake, saying as well that they are unbound by the man’s rules of behavior within mainstream Ashlander culture. They seem to revel in their own notoriety, which seems to suggest that they are not actually as hostile as rumors make them out to be, but rather allow such rumors to spread so as to keep meddling hands out of their business. Many also find many of the stories surrounding them, to be quite humorous and foolish. When asked about the Ghost Snake, and seem to suggest that the truth of the matter is far more complicated than a simple transfer of power from one person to the Mabrigash. From these accounts

When examining the Mabrigash, gender is very important amongst both the tribal Ashlanders and the Mabrigash, but it is far too simplistic to view their existence as simply a reaction to gender relations within Ashlander society. One must remember that a Mabrigash begins her life as a Wise Woman, with the abilities and responsibilities of that position. More than almost any other trait, the Ashlander Wise Women are known for the deep empathy they harbor for their clan and their people. Could it perhaps be, then, that the Mabrigash are simply Wise Women who have forgotten how to care, but this is an overly simplistic view, or are they fulfilling some forgotten prophecy the likes of which we cannot grasp? Could the talk surrounding them be simple myth

None but the Mabrigash themselves know for certain, ready to strike fear into the heart of any man who so much as hears the word ‘Mabrigash.’

Orcs follow the Code of Malacath unless they live as an Imperial citizen that follows Imperial laws. The Code of Malacath is an unwritten set of rules that are pretty basic. Don't steal, but are past on from generation to generation. Orsinium and all Orc strongholds follow the Code of Malacath.

In Orc Strongholds who ever is the strongest male becomes the chief. Only Chiefs can have wives. This method is to ensure that the strongest Orc becomes chief, this is when the criminal bleeds until the victim is satisfied. Orcs all sleep under the same roof of a longhouse and have feasts there as well. Orc strongholds rely on each other and are sort of a big family.

Orc culture is widely surrounded around battle and war. Orcs believe to die in battle would be the most honorable death. Their culture is also surrounded around blacksmithing and have been known for their quality armor they make and their fierceness in battle. These are some of the reasons the Empire recruits Orcs from Strongholds.


Orsinium is considered Orc's homeland even though it has been ransacked many times. Orsinium was first established in the Tenth century of the Second Era. Orsinium started off as a few tribes

Orc historians said it was a utopia, Gremlins, and Ogres that worshipped Mauloch (Malacath) as well. 

However this dream didn't last long. In 1E 950 the first Siege of Orsinium began. Other neighboring countries feared Orcs were gaining too much power so a joint military force made up of the Breton armies of Daggerfall and the Redguard soldiers of Sentinel invaded the Orc homeland

Over the next 3000 years other Orcs attempted to create new homelands

Then in 3E 399, you can read more in [Orsinium and the Orcs.](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/orsinium-and-orcs) 

This new version of Orsinium

Then there is a religous conflict that has brewed for the last 10 years. Most Orcs worshipped the Daedric Prince Malacath. However Gortwog and high ranking shaman priests believe that Trinimac still lives and that Malacath is a separate entity. The Orcs that support Gortwog fear that turning their back on Malacath will anger the Daedric Prince. 


We don't know a whole lot about the second sacking of Orsinium


Orsinium is now relocated between Skyrim and Hammerfell.

1342540211.0,wpf5u,Thoughts on the Eye of Magnus,QuackOfAllTrades,60,10,46,"This is pure speculation (and I’m by no means a lore expert)

What we know is that it’s an extremely powerful artefact with colossal magika potential. It was discovered by the Nords when building Saarthal

**Origins**

Seeing as both the Nords and Falmer had no knowledge of the Eye before it was discovered by accident

My theory is that Magnus was tricked or partially tricked into making the Eye. He was quite intelligent even by the standards of the gods (as he is said to be the one who designed the mortal plane). The Aedra commissioned Magnus to make the Eye for some purpose (which I’ll hypothesize on later). They tricked him either into placing some of his divinity into the Eye, creating the sun and allowing magika to flow into the world.

**Purpose**

Again, when used to project the location of magically powerful objects by using the link of the sun and stars shows the location of the Eye and Staff due to the Eye being tampered with by Ancano. This lends some credibility to the thought that it is linked to the magika flowing into Mundus as it’s so powerful that it blocks out the visibility of every other artefact (minus the Staff). We know it’s linked to magika in some way as it gives Ancano tremendous power when he tampers with it correctly.

We could also think of the Eye as the stone of Snow-Throat

**Tampering and link with the Staff**

From the events of Skyrim, the Staff is a tampering tool for the Eye in the same way that Sunder, Keening or Wraithguard is to the Heart of Lorkhan. If we assume that tampering with such artefacts can only be done in a similar way to how Kagrenac did it (two tools and a protector) then I’d say that the Staff and magika are the equivalent to Keening and Sunder. For this to be true, there would have to be a Wraithguard equivalent. This could be a protective type of spell, the metallic walls that surround the Eye, or something we don’t know of yet. I think the runes themselves on the Eye may be the key, and that the third item in this case isn’t a physical object

I assume that, they could use the Eye to attain semi-godhood in the same way the Almsivi and Dagoth Ur did. However, Dagoth Ur didn’t use Wraithguard when he tampered with the Heart if I remember correctly, and that lead to severe defects such as insanity. Ancano did not have the Staff with him when he tampered with the Eye, meaning he only had two of the pieces needed to tamper with the Eye. This did give him great power, but he appears to lose his sanity along with it.

Magnus the mage was possibly the first to attempt serious tampering with the Eye. Little is known about him, is not known but is probably linked to the Eye and Staff. I think that he, along with other mages in Saarthal attempted to tamper with the Eye and something went wrong, which is what lead to the burying of the Eye. Seeing as the Staff is said to contain the power of Magnus, it’s possible that the Staff consumed him when he attempted to tamper with the Eye incorrectly.

**Link to the Throat of the World**

Again, and this is possibly what Ancano was trying to do when he was tampering with the Eye. My reasoning for this is that he tries to distract the mages of the College by spawning anomalies in Winterhold and creating powerful barriers that only the Staff could undo, which would have usually given him time to destroy the Eye (he also says something about being able to destroy the world but I can’t remember the quote exactly). If it’s true that two towers need to be active for Mundus to stay up, then it would make sense that Ancano would try to destroy it and not use it, as the only other active tower is Direnni Tower. This could also be the reason that the Psijiics took the Eye out of the reach of the Thalmor, as they have no way to undo the Convention as of yet.

**To sum** everything up, knowledge and magic. Many are keen to abuse it like the Almsivi did the Heart, or destroy it to undo Mundus, and this is why the Psijiics are keen to move it.

**SECTION I: GENERAL**

**What is *The Elder Scrolls*?**

*The Elder Scrolls* is a long-running series of video games. The series began in 1994 with the release of *The Elder Scrolls: Arena*, rather than the games themselves.

**What does ""lore"" mean?**

The term ""lore"", obviously, the fictional universe is that of *The Elder Scrolls*. TES lore is immensely vast, and as you dig through it all you'll notice it gets weirder and weirder as you go.

TES lore is unique in that it's completely subjective - nothing is 100% known or factual. It is this attribute that helps make it so great. Through years of discussion, and is therefore right.

**If lore can't be strictly canon or non-canon

You can't. TES lore, depending on what they'd like. Of course, some parts of the lore are much less controversial than others. For example, some will consider lore that can't be found in the TES games ""non-canon"", often due to the strangeness and unfamiliar concepts of it that is far from what they can see in the games.

Here at [/r/teslore](/r/teslore), as they are free to decide themselves. The same goes for comments saying things like ""I don't consider this canon"" where it is irrelevant, as it doesn't contribute to discussion.

**What is [/r/teslore](/r/teslore) all about?**

Here at r/teslore, and everything similar are welcomed here, and anyone with any level of comprehension of the lore can post.

**Who writes the lore?**

Nobody in particular writes the lore; it is a collective effort of many developers at Bethesda. One in particular, often known simply as ""MK"". Though no longer a formal employee of Bethesda's, he continues to write lore through posts on the official forums. You'll likely recognize his work when you can't make head nor tail of it at first glance - MK is infamous for producing cryptic pieces of literature that introduce weird and wonderful concepts into TES. In fact, the strangeness of his work and his informal position at Bethesda are often points for contention regarding the legitimacy of his contributions, and some consider his work non-canon. It is likely you will have a hard time dissuading a lore buff from accepting his work, though.

**Where can I find information about the lore?**

Your first stop should always be [The Imperial Library](http://imperial-library.info/), isn't great for lore. Another great place is the lore section over at [the official forums](http://forums.bethsoft.com/forum/16-elder-scrolls-lore/). Frequents over there have knowledge that, I shamelessly admit, far outranks any of us at [/r/teslore](/r/teslore). If no one can answer a question here, they can. A quick search on a topic of interest over there will also yield some good discussions.

**I'm new to TES lore. Where should I begin?**

Lady Nerevar (librarian at The Imperial Library for those that don't know) wrote a guide on ""[How to Become a Lore Buff](http://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1112211-how-to-become-a-lore-buff/)"", Lady Nerevar links to [Nigedo's Elder Scrolls Lore FAQ](http://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/15282-elder-scrolls-lore-faq/), which is also a great read. Both of these essentially render a lot of this FAQ redundant, but hey, I have a lot of spare time.

**I'm not new to TES lore. How can I further my understanding and knowledge of it?**

Browse the official forums' [lore section](http://forums.bethsoft.com/forum/16-elder-scrolls-lore/) and search there for things that interest you. In-depth discussions are frequent over there

I've found that for the more metaphysical aspect of TES lore, creation stories, deities etc. will prove to be surprisingly helpful. TES lore, at many times, takes inspiration from real-world religions and therefore often bears resemblance to them. Understanding even the basics of things such as Buddhism and Taoism will give you a bit of an edge.

**How do I get dashing flair like yours

The are two symbols given as flair - the Imperial Dragon, well, Penitus Oculatus.

I figured it would be a good idea to have a quick Public Service Announcement concerning a recent topic that has been brought up in several threads

The common argument for stories to be posted exclusively in /r/talesfromtamriel concerns the fact that /r/teslore is supposed to be a lore discussion-only subreddit while /r/talesfromtamriel is the home of in-universe fan fiction. This is a bad assumption.

In truth

**Fan Fiction**

when in the context of Elder Scrolls, they fit the guidelines of /r/talesfromtamriel and should be posted there.

 Some examples of these stories might be [Ancestor's Wrath](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtamriel/comments/187ojr/ancestors_wrath_a_dunmer_dragonborn/) and [The Man in Black](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtamriel/comments/x2dzw/the_man_in_black/)

**Lore Stories**

differ from fan fiction in that they are read not only to entertain one with a thrilling narrative but also to educate one on the lore of the ES universe. Of course, while still being in-universe stories, they still fit the guidelines of /r/teslore and may be posted in the subreddit.

A couple of examples of these are [The Raid on Pyandonea](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/170264/raid_on_pyandonea/) (which, and thus would be a shame to restrict) and [The Withering](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/19fr2u/the_withering/).

# Lore

Known Orcish names consist of the Orc's own name

This can be seen in *Skyrim* in the case of siblings Moth gro-Bagol and Ghorza gra-Bagol.

There are anomalies to this pattern

One of these characters (I believe the gra-Dushnikh one, and so her surname should be the mother's name, not the Stronghold. However, the Orc in question had left the Stronghold and her mother, so perhaps she took the Stronghold name as a way to identify herself by tribe while distancing herself from her immediate family.

Elves in general do not seem to use familial names. Altmer and Bosmer are almost universally only given one name. Dunmer have House names

Identifying an Orc by their parent or tribe serves as a convenient way to make short associations, but I believe that their strongly tribal culture means that children are raised collectively, and the patronymic or matronymic serves as a means of identifying which Orc belongs with which parent at the end of the day, though they are all grouped together otherwise.

Stronghold names would be adopted by orphans or those who were casting off their parents.

Now onto the language.

Orcs have their own ""language"" in *Daggerfall

Orc names are almost always mono- or bi- syllabic. It is very rare for their names to exceed two syllables per name. Notable examples are in Strongholds (Lar-gash-bur

Next up, K, Z, G, N, R, and L are the most commonly used. All of these are formed by manipulating the shape of the mouth and the position of the tongue.

Interestingly, but not by much. A, O, and U dominate the vowel population, and never occur as diphthongs. Y occurs solely as a consonant.

Now I started thinking about this when I was trying to rationalize the lore (or anticipated breaks in lore if they were to happen) in ESO

Now in our world (bare with me on this) it’s considered that time and space are intrinsically tied together. I postulate that the same applies to TES

As we know Aka (Dragon) and Lorkhan (Serpent) are two sides of the same coin, you break the other.

We see in ESO that Molag Bal is trying to merge Nirn and Coldharbour via the Dark Anchors. One space is literally prying it’s way into another. An impossible idea. But as we know, Molag Bal is breaking space. A Serpent Break.

So if we apply my above theory to ESO

Now to take this even further, CHIM is esoteric enough to apply this theory to it).** When Tiber changed the landscape of Cyrodiil, he broke the Serpent, thus breaking the Dragon and making it so Cyrodiil was always a temperate climate.

After receiving the Bands of the Chosen from a Dremora in Camoran's paradise

&gt;How little you understand! You cannot stop Lord Dagon. The Principalities have sparkled as gems in the black reaches of Oblivion since the First Morning. Many are their names and the names of their masters: the Coldharbour of Meridia, and... and Dawn's Beauty, the Princedom of Lorkhan... misnamed 'Tamriel' by deluded mortals.
    Yes, his birthright! He comes to liberate the Occupied Lands!


Since Michael Kirkbride wrote all his dialogue, but I've noticed that:

Meridia, realm of Molag Bal, creator of Vampires (which he created out of spite for Arkay, the aedra associated with life and death) and was at the very least involved in the creation of Soul Gems.

Peryite, is attributed to a realm so chaotic it's basically the Oblivion-Realm equivalent of a person in the Dawn Era (if the Bosmer are to be believed.) (It has no true form, it constantly shifts in appearance)

Mephala is attributed to Moonshadow.

Here is a description of Moonshadow from The Doors Of Oblivion:

&gt;'Too much beauty, a city of silver, but it is all a blur. The colors run like water. It's raining now, and the wind smells like perfume. This surely is Moonshadow, where Azura dwells.'


Now

To oversimplify things, it probably exists.

Since Mephala's realm is pretty much off-limits to mortals, bleak, black, and generally unpleasant to non-assassins (and assassins too, probably). Pretty much the polar opposite of Moonshadow.


ANYWAY, he worships a Daedric Prince sometimes called the Prince of Change, so there is that.

EDIT: I like thenighthawker's explanation for Mephala.

&gt;Moonshadow is so beautiful that it is blinding. Mephala's realm is completely obscured

1356626513.0,15ivy1,[x-post /r/Altmer] The Altmer Misconception,myrrlyn,56,7,50,"I am not the original author
____
It's not hidden that the Altmer are among (if not the) most disliked race. Why? The Altmer are tied to the Thalmor and a few other individuals that come across as rude

For an example

* Ulundil: runs the Windhelm Stables; among the most friendly NPC's in Skyrim

* Legate Fasendil: Imperial Legate that makes camp in The Rift; strongly dislikes the Thalmor

* Nelecar: resides in Winterhold in The Frozen Hearth Inn; helps helps player in The Black Star quest

* Calcelmo: Resides in The Underkeep in Markarth; comes across as rude when you first meet him but you get to see his nice side during the several quests he's in.

* Aicantar: friendly nephew of Calcelmo

* Viarmo: headmaster of the Bards College in Solitude

* Faralda: apart of the College in Winterhold 

* Nenya: steward to the Jarl of Falkreath 


Something to take into account is that not all Altmer agree with the Thalmor's opinions

&gt;Before my numbed mind could comprehend the tumult that consumed my beloved Summerset Isle, they claimed, working deep and subtle magicks. It was their efforts, their sacrifices that delivered the Altmer from extinction. Oh, what fools we were. We wanted so desperately someone to thank for ending our tribulations, we lavished it upon the first to step up and claim the glory. With that simple act of gratitude, we allowed a vile rot to seep into our homeland

&gt;But the people of the Isles soon realized that they had made a terrible mistake of letting the Thalmor into their government

&gt;Ever so cautiously, sending clandestine missives to me when possible.

It's safe to assume that many citizens of the Isles were secretly against the Thalmor

&gt;""Back in 42 I was stationed in Hammerfell, Thalmor mages were attacking the Altmer dissidents who were resisting with magic of their own. I ran to the scene with other Legionaries who were stationed there, but the entire quarter was a smoking ruin by the time we arrived. Everyone was dead. Wholesale slaughter. The Dominion, not content with killing dissidents at home, came to Hammerfell to finish the job.""

There were Altmer who have decided to risk their lives to escape the Isles from the Thalmor, I wouldn't be surprised if at least 70% of the Isles population are against the Thalmor.

## In addition:

The Altmer have been a great driving force behind many off the modern advancements within Tamriel. The Altmer are widely known for their capabilities in architecture and in the arts, they have lended their vast knowledge in math and science. There are also many historians in Tamriel who happen to be Altmer who have furthered the knowledge in all Tamriel.

1355256470.0,14ojmd,The role of the Blades-in-hiding leading up to the events of TESV: Skyrim,,56,10,22,"As a disclaimer: What comes next is pure conjecture

.

The two Altmer walked along the rough path. They were heading deep into the woods east of the Niben Bay, a great brute of a soldier, walked ahead of him, guiding him down the path so his mind could fully prepare for what was sure to be an uproarious battle. They climbed a small hill, and several things happened at once.

They saw a shack, streaming away into the air. It snapped the Justiciar to; he readied a spell and hissed to the solider ""Get down!"" But as soon as the light had come, it was gone. Cautiously, the pair approached the shack. Just as the soldier made to force the door in, a tired voice sounded from within, saying ""Come in, then."" The two exchanged a surprised look, one of which was occupied. Staring up at the two was an incredibly old-looking Altmer.

""Please, ""still your spells. Or are you so oblivious that you cannot see that I have no strength left to resist you?"" The Justiciar reluctantly let the magicka slip back from his fingertips, but the soldier kept his sword drawn, and raised as if to strike the old mer. There was a twinkle in his eyes, despite his apparent exhaustion. He motioned to the chairs. ""Sit, please. All this taking and breaking in is such tiring work. Rest for a moment, and explain who sent you. For I am curious which will win out, or my being a Blade.""

The Justiciar spoke up, I suppose, glossing over the major details as usual. Your Thalmor's never been a group for details, only results. Wine?"" At this, he made to grab a glass bottle on the floor by his chair, but the soldier saw his movement and stepped forward. The old elf's eyes darted to the blade as it came down, and with a swift movement, embedding the soldier's sword in his floorboards. ""Honestly, dead

The Justiciar reluctantly sank into the chair closest to the door, provided he saw the old elf drink first. He did, but even so, he cast a few spells to detect poisons, but found nothing. This amused the old elf. ""It's vintage 3E401, you fool. Not even the most cruel-hearted of assassins would dare add anything to this masterpiece. In fact, this is my last bottle. Smuggled it out of the Summurset Isles myself. Oh, out of *Alinor* myself. Of course."" 

""Now then, cast a little, flickering candlelight above them. ""You're here to take me back, and well enough. It's been too long since I've gazed upon the best our culture has to offer, but I suppose we won't be going through Valenwood then, shall we? And I suppose you'll want me to... oh, what is that phrase... ah! *Come quietly*, we're going now."" Even as the words dribbled out of his mouth, and I must finish off that vintage. Oh, boy?""

The Justiciar bristled. ""I am one-hundred forty and seven years old, knowing that if he restrained his partner there would be punishment later. ""One hundred forty-seven years old, eh? I've lived four of your lives, and I'm damned close to a fifth. 'Learned more than I've forgotten indeed'... I suppose you know the answer to the oh-so-important question of the Khajiit, then, yes? Was your little experiment worth it?"" A befuddled look came over the Justiciar's face. ""Experiment?"" he asked, ""What experiment are you talking about?""

The old elf's eyes twitched to the body of the slain scout for the smallest of moments, then. Khajiit were mer once, if you can believe it. Your Thalmor experimented on them to see if making the moons disappear would make them revert to Aldmer, only I suppose they failed, as per usual, seeing as Void Nights Khajiit are still beasts, not mer."" The Justiciar stared in disbelief. ""That's... ridiculous. I've had quite enough of your stories, he and his partner rose as if it had been agreed upon beforehand. His partner worked his sword out of the floor. But the old elf sat quite still

The old elf looked up at him. Their eyes locked for the briefest of moments. He threw his glass, the soldier's sword found itself embedded in the old elf's chest.

To the amazement of the soldier, even as blood began to flow from his chest. The Justiciar raked him with lightning in his rage, before casting a spell of binding on him. They set a fire in the shack after combing through it for texts the old Blade would have found useful, and began their slow trek back to the prison below the Bay. A quick healing potion fixed the Justiciar's problems, and every so often he would stop to have the soldier beat the old elf. The spell of binding would keep him alive until his use was ended. Sometimes the beatings lasted for ten minutes or more. It wasn't until midmorning that the odd trio finally reached the shores of the Niben Bay. They brought him to the prison beneath the Bay, where he was questioned thoroughly by the best torturers in the Dominion. It was decided that he could not be sent to Alinor due to the actions of the pair, and they were sent in his place for reeducation.

But the old elf began to fade. The torture began to weaken the spell of binding, he broke.

A scribe was brought in

&gt;""Prisoner 093471: I killed him. Broke his soul. Used it to tell them... Told Cloud Ruler. They sent word to the Eagle in the North. He'll move... catch the Bear as he sleeps... Our agent is there. Our agent will be there. But your fools... Your stupid fools let me send the... the message. Too willing to listen. For shame

1341255333.0,vxqgl,The Six Walking Ways (/ Happy 4000th Subscriber),lilrhys,54,5,21,"&gt; * Six are the walking ways

&gt; * Six are the formulas to heaven by violence

&gt; * Vivec said

These are the ""six walking ways to reach heaven by violence"" that I believe Vivec laid out in his 36 lessons and that have been further fleshed out by MK's other works. The ones in **bold** are stuck to that number whilst the others are not:

1) The Prolix Tower/Hurling Disk

2) Dracochrysalis

3) **Scarab that transforms into the New Man**

4) **Mantling (Enantiomorph)**

5) **CHIM**

6) The Numidium

-----------------------------------------------------------------

To start I'll answer a few question about the walking ways.

**What are the Walking Ways?**

The six walking ways are the different ways of ascending to Godhood and further (which I'll explain at the end).

**Where did you get the different walking ways from?**

I used the Loveletter and this quote mainly.

&gt;You in the Fourth Era have already witnessed many of the attempts at reaching the final subgradient of all AE

The failure that this quote refers is to do with reaching Amaranth rather than the Walking Ways and it specifically refers to how the Walking Ways are only a stepping-stone to Amaranth and the Walking Ways it mentions number 6 but they are not the same 6 as I presented. The difference is is that I've changed the Endeavour with Dracochrysalis because the Endeavor is the same thing as CHIM.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Now to go through the list and why I put what where.

1.a) The Prolix Tower.

There is no information on this whatsoever and the only mention of it is in the Mythic Dawn Commentaries and the Loveletter.

If I were to have to give a guess at it then I'd say that it is to ascend in a way so long-winded and boring that it is impossibly boring to explain (Prolix= long-winded - lengthy - verbose - diffuse - wordy).

1.b) The Hurling Disk

This is a way to reach heaven that is stated in the 36 lessons and in the book of hours. It is essentially to achieve divinity during a Dragon Break and especially the Middle Dawn.

&gt;In this world and others EIGHTEEN less one (the victor) is the magical disk

&gt; http://www.imperial-library.info/content/vehks-book-hours-concerning-dragon-break

There is a tenuous link between both of them and that is referring to an extract from the Mythic Dawn Commentaries which calls the Mnemoli as **Prolix** Gods and it is the Mnemoli who appear during Dragon Breaks.

2) Dracochrysalis.

I swapped the Endeavour out for this because that we have proof of a being ascending via this. He is Auri-El

&gt; Auri-El led the original Aldmer against the armies of Lorkhan in mythic times

How do we know that it is by Dracochrysalis he ascended? because the Ald(t)mer followed in his footsteps in trying to ascend by creating the Crystal Tower in emulation of Ada-Mantia. Since we know that the Ald(t)mer practised Dracochrysalis from the Nu-Mantia Intercept:

&gt;Where the Altmer sought to focus on dracochrysalis.

What is Dracochrysalis itself?

This is my explanation of it:

&gt;First of all if we split the word into two we get ""Draco"" and ""Chrysalis"". Draco stands for Dragon and therefore time. Chrysalis is a reference to the cocoon stage of an insects life (vague

&gt;Therefore we have Time Cocoon. If you were to be in a Time Cocoon, something that the Ald(t)Mer are famous for.

&gt;So how do you ascend?

&gt;If you are successful enough at the Time-Cocoon you begin to reverse time. You begin to grow younger and purer and stronger until you finally reach Godhood/Divinity.

3) Scarab that transforms into the New Man

This is the Heart of Lorkhan under a cryptic name. It is the way the ALMSIVI/trinity ascended and it is described as the third walking way by Vivec:

&gt;Trinity in unity is the world and word of action: the third walking path.'

It is common knowledge that the Tribunal used the Heart of Lorkhan so I won't go into any more detail.

4)  Mantling (Enantiomorph)

This is the fourth walking way and it is the way the oversoul of Talos ascended

&gt; Tiber Septim: ""The Stormcrown manted by way of the fourth: the steps of the dead. Mantling and incarnation are separate roads; do not mistake this. The latter is built from the cobbles of drawn-bone destiny. The former: walk like them until they must walk like you. This is the death children bring as the Sons of Hora."" - [Nu-Hatta](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/nu-hatta-sphinxmoth-inquiry-tree)

5) CHIM

&gt;  Late is the lover that comes to this by any other walking way than the fifth

CHIM is the fifth walking way since it is [love](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/pojhf/know_love/) and it is the fastest of the Walking Ways by which I mean it is an instantaneous achievement unlike the others. It is also the only way that leads past godhood but it is still not the furthest one can go. 

6) The Numidium

The creation of the Numidium was an attempt by the Dwemer to unite their souls into one and ascend as one people by use of the Heart of Lorkhan. This could be noted under (3) but I see it as a different way for some reason although in reality it may no be a way at all.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So

By following the Walking Ways one escapes the Kalpa. One does not need to worry about the World-Eaters giant gullet

At the end of the paths there is a jump a jump to Amaranth.

The Sea of Ghosts

by [author's name not yet decided]
 
I have lived for a large part of my life in the city of Haafingar, the icy and mist-wreathed waters that stretch north from the coast of Skyrim to the deserted land of Atmora.
 
Though more properly part of the Padomaic Ocean -- the body of water surrounding Tamriel -- the Sea of Ghosts has a curious name. It is a well-accepted belief
 
Intrigued by the matter, or heroic songs. Several verses of his offered this explanation for the name:
 
*""... and so did Ysgramor lead out his banner’d longship force*

*from Atmora he sailed across the vast expanse of cold*

*retribution for the Night of Tears his grim face foretold*

*until his Companions and he would return to Skyrim’s shores*
 
*But their voyage was not easy and distant seemed the coast*

*Rough seas and stormy weather were the least of their concerns*

*from fog and ice did flicker pale and shimm’ring icy forms*

*his Companions far too stoic to succumb to mere ghosts...”*
 
He confided in me that though there was no evidence for such wraith-like creatures ever existing, and it was widely regarded by most mariners as a symptom of exhaustion on an extended voyage, as accurate as tales of selkies or siren’s calls.
 
I found as much first-hand, all of which over-costed and over-watered their ale): as I had been told before, most debunked the story as hallucinations borne of the fog and aurorae that hang over the waters at night.
 
I was party to other attempts at explaining the soubriquet, volunteered that the ‘ghosts’ referred to the restless spirits of those Atmorans slain by the cold and ice that reclaimed that ancient land. I was even fortunate enough to make conversation with a rare Cyrodified Altmer on a stopover from Firsthold, who grimly joked that the ghosts were sure to be those of the Aldmeri corpses of Skyrim’s first inhabitants, unceremoniously thrown into the waves in contempt!
 
Whatever the source of the ghosts, no ship will receive a name until it is taken for a first voyage and returned safely, thereby demonstrating the spirits’ disinterest in the demise of the vessel. As a result, all Nordic sailors are supremely confident in their chosen ship, satisfied that the artifice of Haafingar’s shipmakers will protect them not only from choppy waters and storms, but also the mysterious ghosts of the sea.",,,Psijic,

Right now I just have parallels and coincidences to speculate about

I think there is some relation between Akatosh (manager of time) and H-M (daedric prince of knowledge and fate

H-M has a big interest in dragonborn mortals.  This parallel's Akatosh's agents being immortal dragons.  But H-M kept Miraak around for thousands of years as his champion.  Apocrypha contained dragons for him to enslave.  Where did H-M get them?  Much of the main quest in Skyrim involves searching for forgotten lore from sources unknown to present-day man.  The Skaal say that H-M was known to the Atmorans as the demon of knowledge - could the Dragon Cult have been his handiwork to enslave man

I just can't see it as a coincidence that H-M was behind so much of the corruption on Solstheim in Dragonborn.   Nothing this big is a coincidence or sideplot in TES.

Many people feel a connection between Sermons 12 through 14,"" but there seems to be a stronger connection there, a metaphysical subtext that is not immediately obvious.

Later in the 36 Lessons, where he was forced to marry to Molag Bal with wet scriptures to cement his likeness as Mephala and write with black hands.""

Why was lying with Molag Bal a **requirement** to becoming the anticipation of Mephala?

There may be a thematic equivalency.  For example, it's possible that she is in the process of killing her children, much as Vivec does after the Banquet.  And sure, Mephala is the Daedric Prince of Sex and Murder, and that does sum up the Banquet quite well.

But there is a more interesting point here.  Consider [this quote from Sermon 11](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:36_Lessons_of_Vivec

&gt;According to the Codes of Mephala, cut both of them off. God has no need of theory and he is armored head to toe in terror.

Mepahala operates without desire.  She performs sex without lust and murder without fear.  And vice versa.  She is synchronous

To become a Ruling King, and fear does not exist in the hands of a Terrorist.    You become clear of mind and devoid of fear.

This could also be a part of the symbolism behind Vivec's title of ""Mastery.""  I'd argue that Almalexia, or the Sword, and Sotha Sil controls the domain of **Reason**, or the Word.  Vivec controls both, which is why both of Mephala's hands are black.

This leads us at last to our connection with CHIM.  From [Vehk's Teaching

Imagine being able to feel with all of your senses the relentless alien terror that is God and your place in it, which is everywhere and therefore nowhere, and realizing that it means the total dissolution of your individuality into boundless being. Imagine that and then still being able to say “I”. The “I” is the Tower.

Facing down the Godhead requires incredible bravery because God is armored head to toe in terror.  Simply being in its presence is terrifying, as you are insisting that you exist despite inarguable evidence to the contrary, and this requires an argument based on a complete lack of reason.

**Leveraging Natural Advantages**

Whiterun typifies the Nord approach to sewage. The city is clean and vibrant

That is because Whiterun was built on a hill for a reason. A well at the top serves the palace at Dragonsreach. From here water flows down into two sluices and finally into drains south into the White River. A second sluice also originates in the Cloud District and does the same.

The denizens of Whiterun use these sluices for sewage and sanitation. They empty chamber pots into the waters, drink, and cook. I would not advise a newcomer to drink directly from the water without first boiling it, but those who have lived in Whiterun for years have become accustomed to whatever minor maladies inhabit the slightly tainted water.

Of course there are drawbacks for those living in the Plains District. As they live nearest the end of the sluice

**The Beam in Your Eye**

Overall, where cities like Bravil and Leyawiin have much to learn from the inventiveness of the Nords. 

The pools of standing water in these cities function more like cesspools than reservoirs. In Leyawiin

A system of airation like the slopes and falls in Whiterun's sluice system would go a long way to keeping the region's water potable. As the current administrator of Cyrodil's sewage system

**Spriggan Behaviour**

Spriggans seem to be particularly hostile and suspicious of strangers. Spriggans mostly avoid the roads, including myself, believe them to be creatures of Kyne, and serve her, by protecting her fantastic wilderness from invaders,

One theory is that  spriggans dislike technology and the destruction of their forests, Spriggans are found occupying ruins or guarding places they deem important. When somebody invades this, they protect themselves.
To me, such as bears. Spriggans of Solstheim also have the astounding ability to heal themselves. Whether this is a form of magic, or a natural regenerative property, it is quite impressive.

Spriggans also seem to have a unique language


**Spriggan Anatomy**

Spriggans have long, copious spriggan sap would be found. As a priest, I would never defile such a wonderful creature's body, but I have reports that it can alchemically enhance the users Alteration abilities. This seems to be of interest, as spriggans most certainly have some form of Alteration magic about them. The Wispmother, by Mathias Ettiene, shows that a member of the Synod believes that spriggans are simply spirits of what they represent

Also harvested from the spriggans body are two woods of alchemical significance. Heartwood, amongst other things. Taproot also seems to have the ability to modify magic, whether for positive or negative purpose. Often, growths like berries are able to found on Spriggans.

**Hagravens**

Hagravens, it is unknown, but to a disgusting, evil one no doubt. Some speculate the a spriggan must be sacrificed in order to become one of the Princes servants, but this is unconfirmed. This seems to be the source of the enmity between them.

Amendment: It has come to my attention that a phenomenon exists known as *Burnt Spriggans*. I have been told that these oddities are infused with some manner of pyromancy

1350827751.0,11udev,Identifying the Ancient Nord Pantheon,ginja_ninja,55,7,28,"So I was playing my second Skyrim character exploring a place called High Gate Ruins. It's on the northwest shore of the landmass just east of the Solitude marsh and northeast of Morthal.

I progressed a fairly long way into the ruins before encountering a hallway and noticing its walls were adorned with carvings. A magelight orb on the ceiling shed some more light on them: 

http://imgur.com/a/11q0P

It's pretty clear that these are some of the undiluted

*Varieties of Faith* states Skyrim's traditional pantheon to be: **Alduin, Tsun, Mara, Stuhn, Kyne, Jhunal, Shor, Herma-Mora

Each of these carvings follows a template: the god is in the center in human form

The [first picture](http://i.imgur.com/DH18U.jpg) I think I can pretty conclusively posit is Shor. His attire looks very traditionally Nord, the bull's horns. The bull seems to have a strong love for and invested interest in the races of men. Finally, his top image is a great Sea Serpent. This is not the only instance of the Lorkhan-being having connections with the Serpent. I imagine the origin of this symbol came from either the original voyage over the Sea of Ghosts to Atmora or the Return. [Conjecture](/g ""The Atmorans, during their voyage, encountered a great serpent that rose out of the sea and did battle with it. Facing it down with the spears Shor himself had once taught them to fashion, they believed it was the spirit of mighty Shor himself come from the sea to challenge their mettle as warriors. And lo, upon its defeat the great beast began to rise out of the water, and soon it was nothing more than a skeleton

The [second picture](http://i.imgur.com/5cQ6o.jpg), more aedric. The patterns on her clothing seem more elaborate, like they were made with cloth and dyes rather than hides like some of the others'. Also note the moths. This is what really puzzles me, I don't know which of the aedra, if any, is traditionally associated with the Ancestor Moth, which these pretty much have to be. Even though she is placed across from Shor's carving in the hallway, but I'm thinking #5 would be a better fit for Kyne. Not sure about that one either though, so it would be great for anyone that could speak more on her to weigh in. The final component of her carving is the top section, pre-convention

The [third picture](http://i.imgur.com/4tgmf.jpg) I can feel a lot more confident in my guess though. This one has got to be Jhunal. The owls, however, I can't even draw a connotation with a real-world creature like a dragon. It looks vaguely humanoid, although more merethic than human, has what appears to be a third eye on its forehead, and its elven-looking ears sprout out into owl wings. *VoF* mentions that Jhunal had a falling out with the other gods of the Nordic Pantheon, which is what led to him becoming Julianos in Cyrodiil and forgotten by Nordic religion. [Conjecture](/g ""Given that his and Mara's(?) 'totems' look markedly different than the other three

The [fourth picture](http://i.imgur.com/tmBC1.jpg) is another really interesting one that merits discussion. Its totem is a cat or beast. To me it looks very Khajiit-like, and surrounded by ravens with a raven's skeleton above him. In Skyrim, there's some mention of the Forsworn worshipping the ""Old Gods,"" the gods from before the Divines came to be. Could this be one of them? Does he have no modern equivalent, his name forgotten to all but the Reachmen? The only possible guess I could hazard as to an identity could be Hircine due to the animals and Padomaic/Necromantic nature of the Forsworn, Hagravens, and their rituals. Hagravens are said to have an immense hatred of Kyne, Hircine or whoever else

The [fifth picture](http://i.imgur.com/iATpp.jpg) I want to guess is Kyne. Her totem is an eagle and she is adorned everywhere with wings. Being the goddess of the air and goddess of nature, or at least the Hagravens they worship, appear to be in staunch opposition to Kyne, to the point of capturing, torturing, and sacrificing spriggans. [Conjecture](/g ""This again points me to the conclusion that there are multiple layers of history in the mythology of Ancient Tamriel, and that not all of the beings who became Divines were truly 'original spirits.' There appears to be much more that happened

So I did my best to interpret each of the images based on what I observed in them. I know a lot of you are extremely well-versed in pretty much every aspect of the lore so I'd love for everyone else to weigh in on it and point out their own observations and guesses.",,t5_2t5ay,False,,Psijic,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/11udev/identifying_the_ancient_nord_pantheon/

Greetings

This is a guide to help you

/r/teslore is a subreddit where lore-freaks and talented scholars come together to share knowledge, that can do everything from explain every tidbit of lore to decipher the mysterious writings of Micheal Kirkbride. All these great scholars had to have a start, though. Every experienced scholar and lore-buff was once just a person curious for answers. As with science, one cannot simply comprehend its vast reaches of knowledge, you have to start somewhere. By posting simple, yet well written posts, participating in thread discussions, one can achieve great knowledge in little time. Just follow these steps

**Learning Lore**

Before one can post and participate in /r/teslore, but there are some sources that can get you started. The best way to start is by reading the [Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages’ Overview of history]( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:History) can give you a good overview of historical events you will need to understand in order to participate in /r/teslore. After you have read through the history, the best way to start learning is by researching different things you care about in www.uesp.net and http://www.imperial-library.info/. Look up any article, and follow links from there. For example, if I were to be a new scholar interested in Argonian culture, I would look up Argonian information in UESP. From there, I would be interested in Black Marsh’s history, and then I would research Yokuda, it’s time to start getting involved in the subreddit.

**Posting**

So you think you know a good amount of basic lore

Questions aren’t always for threads, and read through and analyze the answers. 

So now you have a question, it’s time to post a thread.

Every thread should have a good

In the post itself

If you are posting a question

If you are posting a theory or an explanation of lore, do your best to answer them clearly and provide any additional information needed. 

Once you have posted your thread, explanatory, thoughtful comments and never downvote if you simply do not agree with the comment. If you do not agree with the comment, make a good comment arguing against it. Making a good argument and strongly debating it is much better and more honorable than simply throwing around downvotes.

So go ahead and post, never stop asking.

**Becoming a good scholar**

After you have started posting and commenting you are ready to start your existence as a scholar of ES lore. Now that you know how to handle yourself in the subreddit, upvote and downvote, and most importantly remember to learn. If you ever go by the thought that you are ultimately knowledgeable and have no more to learn, you are not worthy of being called a scholar. A good scholar always seeks new frontiers. Imagine if humans in the renaissance age decided that they can never learn more- that their way of life is perfect and nothing should change. The same goes for understanding of lore. As long you are interested, keep learning.
It really all comes down to curiosity. Now that you know the basics you are ready to unleash that curiosity at the subreddit and start getting involved. Don’t be afraid

Post

So get out there! You’ve got to start somewhere

1347911197.0,101dwz,Convention 2.0,lilrhys,54,4,83,"**Foreword: I'm writing this theory down as to have ~~an impossipoint in r/teslore~~

This a pet theory of mine which tries to fix the leap between Towers holding up Mundus (Nu-Mantia intercept) and Talos holding up Mundus (Altmeri commentary on Talos).

------------------------------------------------------------------

Talos ascended as 3 when Hjalti Early-Beard

&gt; What are the Towers?

&gt; They are magical and physical echoes of the Ur-Tower
The powers also created Red Tower and the First Stone. This allowed the Mundus to exist without the full presence of the divine. - NuMantia Intercept

The Aldmer who witnessed the creation of Ada-Mantia by Auri-El also subsequently saw Auri-El's ascension at Ada-Mantia in an attempt to teach his followers how to do the same.

&gt; He [Auri-El] then ascended to heaven in full observance of his followers so that they might learn the steps needed to escape the mortal plane. - Varieties of Faith

The Aldmer subsequently attempted to do so. Different cults and groups took different attempts to do so. The Dwemer created Anumidium, no more Sunbirds and Mananauts......

The lowpoint of this trend is the Thalmor. The Altmer no longer have the knowledge of ascension that Auri-El taught them and so see no need in the Towers. The Towers are no longer gates to Aetherius from their material prison but Iron bars in their prison cell. The Thalmor therefore want to smash the bars of their prison cells. Orichalc and Red Tower have already fallen by the Oblivion Crisis and the Crisis itself takes down 3 more (Crystal-Like-Law, Adamantia and Khajiit (If they are a Tower) become their next targets. The Thalmor kill the Mane (the supposed Stone of the Khajiit) and they flood Skyrim with Justiciars looking to take down Snow-Throat. According to the the Book of the Dragonborn Snow Tower is down before Skyrim starts meaning that either a) Snow-Throat is still up or b) Something else is holding up Mundus. If (a) is correct then we must still think of the other potential Stones; Eye of Magnus (tried to be used by a Thalmor agent), Alduin (killed at the end of the MQ) and Paarthy (disappears after the events of MQ).

Therefore I believe (B) is the case. What holds up Mundus then? Talos.

&gt;To kill Man is to reach Heaven

&gt;To achieve this goal

&gt;1) Erase the Upstart Talos from the mythic. His presence fortifies the Wheel of the Convention

As I previously stated Talos mantled Convention, ""Talos fortifies the Wheel of Convention"" by doubling it and also acts like a Tower thus satisfying both Nu-Hatta and the Thalmor.

So

**Culture**

Sadly there isn't a lot we know for sure about the culture of the Ayleid thanks to the Marukh and his order, they were not Daedra worshipers in the sense that the Velothi were Daedra worshipers, they likely had some Daedra in their pantheon, [Shezarr and the Divines](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/shezarr-and-divines) gives the Impression that the Ayleid pantheon was very similar to Aldmeri pantheon, however we know for a fact that the Ayleid people worshiped Meridia, they viewed her as the embodiment of their most sacred element, light. One of their ruins also bears the name of Dagon, Atatar Haelia Dagon

If I were to make an educated guess then I would say that the Ayleid pantheon consisted of Auriel, Stendar, Xen, Meridia, Vaermina, and Azura.

Auriel is presumed because the Ayleid had built one of the Towers, as well as Stendar and Xen. Meridia represented Light in the Ayleid religion, and had a deal with their king, so I would presume her worship was very important. I just put Vaermina in there because her sphere is related to torture, and the Ayleidoon slave masters really seemed to enjoy torture. Feel free to swap her out for any other god you see fit. Azura fits in to the theme of light in the Ayleid religion since she is the goddess of dusk and dawn.

You'll also note a pervasive theme in Ayleid culture, in crowns, in names. I believe this is because of interbreeding between Aldmeri settlers the native bird folk of Cyrodiil as described in [Father of the Niben](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/father-niben). It would explain why there is only one copy of Torpals expedition, as interracial breeding was seen as abhorrent in the eyes of the Ald/tmer, and anybody who was convicted of this was sent into exile on the mainland (Source: [Pocket Guide to the Empire, First Edition](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/pocket-guide-empire-first-edition-aldmeri-dominion))

There is a vast difference between the Pre Alessian Ayleid and the Post Alessian Ayleid. The Pre Alessian Ayleids seemed to be outgoing in a sense, and the Falmer language is Ayleidoon written in a different alphabet, so it can also be assumed that they were on good terms with the Falmer, and when the Alessians forced the remaining Ayleid people out of Cyrodiil their first thought was to go to Valenwood, which would seem to put them on good terms with the Bosmer. Compare this with the highly isolationist Post Alessian Tribes described in the book [The Wild Elves](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/daggerfall-wild-elves) and it is a rather shocking turn around. They even changed their language, In Pre Alessian Ayleidoon Pelinal meant ""Star Made Knight"" in Post Alessian Ayleidoon Pelani means ""Outsider.""

Some will tell you that the Tribunal are false gods

Some will tell you the Tribunal are good and just

Listen, but few know that what happens tomorrow can change yesterday. Many speak different views on the same matter, each convinced that their position is the truth. Here is the secret: they are all right.

It is known that the Tribunes were mer, that the Heart was a key to their ascension, but as great as the Heart's power was, it was not the sole reason for their godhood. Just as a skilled archer can shoot an arrow with greater force and accuracy than even a strong man could throw it, the Heart propelled the Tribunes towards the mantling of their Anticipations, and we shall speak of each of them in turn.

Vivec was the greatest success. Some who know secrets condemn him for the murder of the Hortator, the mantling of Mephala was not enough, for he learned of a state higher than this, beyond all words and blades. This is spoken of with the divine word CHIM, and in his grace Vivec wrote three dozen lessons through which those with understanding could follow his burning path.

Almalexia is the greatest tragedy of the Tribunes. While she took on the nature of the Dunmer's god-ancestor, Almalexia's hold began to unravel. She saw plans in shadows and conspiracies in random chance; not content with seeing these threads everywhere, she bound herself up in her own webs, an afflicted spider only crippling her own limbs.

Sotha Sil is the greatest mystery. His Anticipation was Azura, and his focus was the divine act of creation. The secret is that his embodiment of Azura -- though some will say he had partial influence on that Twilight at best -- was the thread tying together the strange days of the Nerevarine, and ultimately causing great calamity.

Who, false to the Dunmer, Prince of nothing but her own bitterness, let your name be never spoken again but as a curse. AYEM AE SEHTI AE VEHK.

Now, well crafted theory. My only issue is that there is a much simpler reason for the observed decline of weapon variety and technology that can be observed in the gameplay.

I believe that the reason for this is simple- region.

Morrowind, filled with varying flora and fauna, a veritable cacophony of ideologies, landscapes, and what have you. It is a very diverse land, and that is reflected in its weaponry as well. In Morrowind, you have spears, shuriken

Skyrim, and its people are rough and hardy. Their land is not flamboyant and host to a multitude of different climate zones. In fact, there are really only three- temperate, subarctic, and arctic. In this case, the land and people are reflected in their weaponry yet again. All that exist in Skyrim are bows, swords, maces, embedded in their psyche

Cyrrodiil is somewhat of a ""happy medium"" between Morrowind and Skyrim. It is a melting pot of cultures and schools of thought, if you will- there is a variety, but not an unnecessary quantity of options.

The issue that many people have with this is that the observer can never actually observe all three places at once in the same time period. Which, and could possibly (albeit falsely, in my opinion) reflect a possible dark age.

###A Pocket Guide to the Ages
    
*Part I*

___
Greetings, you too are one unfettered by such trivial things as the grasp of Aka or the cage of convention. So, presented in these pages is a simple guide through the ages; so you may explore with foreknowledge of what to expect and how to dress accordingly.

All that lay before the annals of time started with a whisper. No, that's not right either. The preconceived concept that thinking of a whisper may be an option. And with the idea of the possibility of a word uttered under still breath; Anu and Padomay came along. No more siblings than they were enemies; more verbs than nouns; both all and nothing; one pushing and one pulling before such actions were even tangible. And forth from the two undefinable, the rest fell into place. First, as the void persisted, conflict between the primordial forces went on unknown and unrecorded.  All events happened simultaneously and not at all.

Anu and Padomay looked upon what was transpiring between each other and with that, Anui-El came to be. Padomay, struck silent by the shock of introspection, paused a moment; and thus Sithis was also born. With both these children, each side of the coin was complete. With order and adaptation in place; Aurbis, the canvas for creation, was set.

From this state, henceforth in his presence, the void would no longer be simultaneous and rhyme-less, but instead time would reign as law. But, as you may be already aware, laws can be bent and sometimes; broken.

With the passing of these generations of Anu also came the progeny of the whirling chaos. From Sithis came another to bear many names; Lorkhan

It is highly recommended to all travelers of whom would like to witness events of the Dawn Era; consider all complications involved in a vacation spanning before times advent. Remember, are nebulous and untethered, order and age indeterminable. More like the dream of a restless mind than the passing of events. After such considerations have been made, cancel your plans and instead use your powers of space/time to visit Elsweyr to indulge in a bit of Skooma. While this too may be inadvisable, it will still yield better results than your previous itinerary.

With the architecture for existence laid, these thoughts garnering their own spirit. Born to one of two houses, the children of Padomay and Anu came to play and to build. And build they did. The Aurbis henceforth, still young and unsculpted, would never be the same.

Who is Alkosh? Where is his place amongst the other pantheons? Much is obscured, that the answers are not as simple (I use that term loosely, mind you) as the other pantheons would put it. Following the khajiiti creation myth, Alkosh is a product of the union of both Anu and Padomay (known to the khajiit as Ahnurr and Fadomay), as is every other god (or at least those mentionned in the myth). Now where does that lead us? Both Anuic and Padomaic? 
Lets look at Elsweyr:
We have a province that is half desert, then he in turn accuses the first of being savage. Does this sort of relationship not strike a familiarity? 

Following the fact that the Khajiiti creation myth continues on the elven road of portraying Lorkhan as a trickster (even if his birth and location of would see him somewhat sympathetically), as the khajiit say themselves. Undeniably one will look at the story of their creation myth and think that their gods are more Padomaic in nature. Perhaps it was true once, then not, but today it seems that it is true. For some. The marukhati sought to remove anuic aspects, thus elven, of akatosh, and so they did. To the khajiit, akatosh
--It should be noted that the Khajiit view the padomaic more in the fashion that others see the anuic


The Riddle'thar seems to have taken over a great part of the worship once attributed to Alkosh. He was introduced by one of the manes : Rid-Thar-ri'Datta. He seems to act as Anuic gods generally do. To quote ""some of his avatars like to appear as humble messengers of the gods."" Were I to deduce certain facts from general knowledge, while Alkosh, as it is said ""he still enjoys immense popularity in Elsweyr's wasteland regions"" is mostly venerated in the north, the desert. I assume this since the Riddle'thar seems now more popular than Alkosh, and would assume most of the population of elsweyr lies in the south seeing as it is the richer part and more travelled path (for, indeed, the south possesses most if not all of the port cities). The riddle'thar may very well be the sundered aspect of Alkosh under a new name.



Now, where do they come? The origins of the Khajiit are shrouded in mystery, they exist since beyond written time. I shant tackle the means by which they came to be, how long have they truly been on Nirn, for it has far less information of note than their creation myth. What we do know: They were of the same kin as the wood elves, who are no true mer. Both have been changed from their original unknown forms. I do not doubt Azura was responsible for their present form, her abilities to so drastically influence a people is evident enough on my own ashen skin. Her capacity to tie the Khajiit's physiology to the moons however, who turned the bosmer into their current forms
Were I to speculate wildly, and that this aligment protects Nirn from the wrath of Ahnurr, what might that be...)



Now on to the elements pertaining to the tower and their stone. First and foremost, like adamantine, snow throat, red mountain and so on are older than mer. Now, it has been speculated that the stone of the Khajiiti is the Mane, their spiritual leader. As all stones have to do with Lorkhan, and certain sources point to the Mane being the third moon, their very kin, for exterminating a race as clever in desperation as the Khajiit in its entirety is not likely. 



On the thalmor it is to be said, orsimer and dunmer. If there is a reason behind this I shall pursue it until it unveils its secrets before me. Until then I shall endeavor to go through bosmeri lore surrounding Y'ffre. So far I am lead to believe he may be an aspect of Lorkhan, as a prophet mentions his return it seems to match the idea that Lorkhan is secretly working to move the gears beneath the world to engineer some sort of event, be it his return or otherwise. If such a thing reveals true, then my belief that the forests of Valenwood are the stone of Falinesti may reveal plausible. The great migrating tree did only root after the oblivion crisis, when trees once protected by the wood elves were inevitably damaged by the ongoing daedra onslaught.



I would speak more of my thoughts but the riddles and possible truths are infinite and sleep has eluded my troubled mind for long and it seems to now finally call. I must admit my weariness grew as I wrote and I apologise if the quality of the work lessened. I encourage any that wish to give thoughts on my work to do so
May night and dream bring you all counsel.

If so, she is no doubt the tramp Vehk is talking about, because Indoril is the house - Nerevar went by the name Indoril Nerevar. Vehk guesses that he'd be the guard of a caravan (or canvasari in Chimeri), and that's how Nerevar is portrayed in the sermons before he became Hortator.

Vehk then changes the subject - it turns out, hopefully) and for a scrib-roll, he'll make it a little more intimate. If I understand right, he then makes it known to Nerevar that he is a hermaphrodite and has both female and male genitalia.

This is interesting

&gt;***What makes us great?***

&gt;*For true, too? Or does his lordship want it Saliache, weeping and weak-kneed with their lisp, their lilt, as I can do that, too.*

Vehk immediately rejects the suggestion that Nerevar is great. To him, he goes back to trying to sell himself. I don't know what ""Saliache"" is, but with the following context, I think I can guess.

&gt;***Where do we live?***

&gt;*Eh? This is the Mourning Hold, or the under-docks, and mark my only-known days with sores. You tilt your head in a way that I do not like.*

They're in Mournhold, he takes offense to the way Nerevar appears to judge him.


&gt;***How do we live?***

&gt;*You? You seem to live no life that I can match, then: you have riches and a good master. So pay now or move on. I live by gutting those that would estimate me as some other worth; higher, lower, base, or dumb beast.*

Vehk again separates himself from Nerevar, always wears a mask and lives his life behind it (more than literally). Vehk lives a rough lifestyle in a dog-eat-dog world. Again he sees that Nerevar is wealthier than he, and is becoming impatient that he's not buying anything.

&gt;***What is important in my life?***

&gt;*That’s for yourself to esteem. By now, or flin? I’d show you a roof where we could look on this poor country of ash-woven outcasts and share sigils. Share spears.*

All this deep talk has bored Vehk

&gt;***Who rules us?***

&gt;*That [censored]-[censored] of a storm that runs The Orphanage, if only for a minute?*

I'm assuming ""The Orphanage"" is some kind of brothel that Vehk belongs to. I don't know what Vehk means by ""sigils"" - coins

He asks Nerevar if he can wear his mask, but he wants to become something bigger, which is interesting, because he does - when he eventually penetrates Nerevar with Muatra. Metaphors everywhere.

&gt;***What makes a Chimer great?***

&gt;*Making sure the other dies before you.*

Again representative of his lifestyle. Also of Boethiah

&gt;***What is the difference between men and women?***

&gt;*There is no difference in me

Vehk hints again at his hermaphroditism. He's very impatient now

&gt;***What is evil?***

&gt;*Teasing.*

Very impatient.

&gt;***What is my lot in life?***

&gt;*A sixth-dram dropped, I’d rather have that than your hand. It has the ghartoki on it. Hold now, they both do. Who are you, sandal man?*

If I'm right, but I think Vehk has noticed that Nerevar isn't the type to purchase sex. Instead, he tries to sell him the story of his house. Vehk then notices Nerevar has the ""ghartoki"" on his hands, and becomes quite serious.

If you know your sermons, in Ehlnofex, means ""hand/s"", and PADHOME means Padomay. Therefore, Nerevar had ""Hands of Padomay"" or something similar written on his hands.

I don't know what ghartoki is in this context


&gt;***How do we deal with others?***

&gt;*For you, and wear it twice. And I would be new, and believe in the one moon and star as your banner does. I’d make a legend of this netch longhook. Make no frown that this will be my weapon in your guard, however low its station. We all drink from the milk of our fathers. I’d learn to read and then write so that I could see right your name forever. And I would clean your feet so that the next time you made treaty it would be with an assured step.*

This whole thing seems poetic and post-mortal in nature

Vehk says he would shave his head to deal with Nerevar (whatever that means), but later he is bald. Thoughts?

He also says he would take the sigil of Vel[oth], he takes that name. He says he will wear it twice, and he did - once as Vehk the Mortal, once as Vehk the God. Vehk and Vehk. V'Vehk. Vivec. Still blows my mind.

So again, ""believ[ing] in the one moon and star as [his] banner does"", and being ""in [his] guard"". Could his netch longhook be Muatra? Drinking his father's milk is very interesting, given Vehk's history of using the term ""milk-finger"".

&gt;***Who are our enemies?***

&gt;*He that says your name wrong, or the mock-walkers of our cousins, the tunnelers. This, too: the [censored]-[censored] of storm if she does not take your hand when you ask it. And I see this idea behind that mask of yours already. You aim to take the land anew. You aim to wake the old sleeper. You aim to make the sky red. You have a name for it already.*

The first part refers to non-Chimer (he talks about Nords and Dwemer), again.

Vehk then sees Nerevar for him

&gt;***Who are our gods?***

&gt;*Old things. Leftovers. We left them all behind with the weepers. Their names now are only numbers. I’ll become good with those

I have no idea about this part. Are the weepers the Altmer? Are their gods the ones he's talking about? I do know that the last line gave me *chills*.

The Dunmer ( 'Dark', Dark may refer to more than just 'dark-skinned', as the other translations seem to fit Dunmeri culture and history well), are the ash-skinned elves of the eastern province of Morrowind. These elves are noted for their unnerving appearance, and their long history of violence, and, in the past
	
As all elves, a slender and agile build, and a strong affinity to magic. Unlike most other elves, they focus on the use of the destruction school of magic, which fits their culture and society well. Possibly because of this focus, they have developed noteworthy resistance to fire. They also have the ability to call upon their ancestors protection, in the form of a magical shield or a spirit that helps during combat. This is a result of their ancestor worship.  
Alongside the standard elven traits, which is often seen as eerie by men who see a Dark Elf for the first time. Their physical appearance is part of a curse, laid upon them by the Daedric prince Azura.

The Dunmer find their origin in the Chimer (Changed Ones) and, the Aldmeri culture eventually disbanded. One of the groups that split and went to settle modern day Morrowind, were the Chimer, led by Saint Veloth. One of the main reasons of the split lay in the Daedra worship, advocated by the Chimer, which was met by dismay of the Aldmer. When the Chimer landed in Morrowind, they found their distant cousins the Dwemer (Deep Ones, during the first era, led by Dumac dwarf-king, and brought prosperity to both people. However
Just after the disappearance, wanting to council his advisors first, trusted Dagoth with protecting the tools. According to the Tribunal, after he counselled his advisors, the later Tribunal of Almalexia, Sotha Sil and Vivec, and the Daedra Azura, to tell Dagoth that the tools were to be kept safe, refused to give them back
The Ashlanders hold a different tradition. According to them Nerevar was murdered by the Tribunal, changing them into the Dunmer they are now. The Tribunal went up and in Red Mountain to kill Dagoth Ur. The Tribunal, now alone with the Heart and the tools, used them to get their immortality, and instituted themselves as the new gods of the Dunmer. After some years of studying their newly found powers, the Tribunal found the way to regain their original, Chimeri appearance, Vivec having one side golden golden

Culturally, the Morag Tong. When a Morag Tong assassin kills someone as part of his contract and is caught, he only has to show his writ of execution to be left alone. Furthermore, the Dunmer show a hatred towards outsiders, and often calling them names.

Originally, Mephala, and Boethiah, and despised four others, known as the 'four corners of The House of Trouble', Sheogorath, Mehrunes Dagon, and Molag Bal. After the war of the First Council, the Dunmer worshipped their living gods, though. The Tribunal has never been accepted by the Ashlander Tribes of Vvardenfell

The politics of the Dunmer are significantly different from the rest of Tamriel. Since the Dunmer were never really conquered by the Empire, politics in Morrowind are divided in five Great Houses, which share resemblance to a clan structure. The Houses are Hlaalu, Redoran, Dres, Telvanni and Indoril.  
House Hlaalu is a House of opportunists. While they held the best contacts with the Empire and were noted for their openness (having the most a non-Dunmer councillor)
House Redoran is more traditionally. They didn't despise the Empire
If Redoran is traditional, since their territory is near the border with Argonia (Argonians being popular slaves).  
House Telvanni is a very xenophobic house, the mages of Telvanni are known to be very individual, almost always concerning themselves just with their own research and progress.  
The last House, and possibly the most important, house of Morrowind. Since their capital, Mournhold, was both the seat of power of the king of Morrowind and Almalexia of the Tribunal, the Indoril have always been strongly present all around Morrowind. Since Almelexia took a liking towards the Indoril, they have been gaurds of the Temples throughout Morowind. After the death of the Tribunal

After the Battle of Red Mountain
There had been multiple skirmishes with both the Alessian Empire (the last year of which is detailed in the book series '2920') and the Septim Empire. Morrowind was the only province not conquered, and Tiber Septim got control of Numidium, a Dwemer war machine found under Red Mountain. Tiber Septim would later use it to take the other provinces.  
At the end of the third era, and Redoran. and Nerevarine by the Ashlander Tribes, he climbed the Red Mountain and destroyed both Dagoth Ur ( being kept on Nirn by the Heart of Lorkhan) and the Heart itself, destroying the immortality of the Tribunal. This led to the end of the Tribunal religion, and the Dark Elves went back to their old Daedra worship.  
With the death of the Tribunal, to crash into the land with all it's original force, since the only thing keeping it in the air was the levitation potions, which were offered by the many pilgrims. This caused Red Mountain to erupt, destroying Vvardenfell and parts of Morrowind. The Dark Elves, weakened and surprised, were then attacked by the Argonians of Argonia, or scattered across Tamriel, resigned their claim of the island

Most of this theory stems from ""[The Seven Fights of The Aldudagga](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/seven-fights-aldudagga).""  In the first fight

Now, and I'll get to evidence that's a little more measurable.

It seems to be a general consensus on this subreddit, it would simply reset the current kalpa (in contrast to their theories of ascension).  It would seem to end the kalpa a little bit differently from how most end, though.  Would Alduin still need to devour the world in this case?  Perhaps all kalpas end simply when all of the towers are destroyed (I can think of a few good arguments toward that), but there is no evidence that I know of.

What if destroying the destroying of the towers dismembered creation enough to end Dagon's curse?

The Oblivion Crisis destroyed two towers: White-Gold and Crystal-Like-Law (and maybe others that I've forgotten).  What if that was Dagon's entire intention?

As for his leading the Thalmor now

&gt;Herkel Shield-Fed now looked at Dagon cockeyed and said, though pierced to their five-thousandth rank, would not be stopped?"" to which Dagon responded, ""Of course! Though it was easy, as they hated you anyway, but yes, yes, which has only now saw fit to stop burning!...""

The way I see it

With you my fellow scholars I wish to discuss the current state of the Dunmer people, the Nevararine killed Almalexia in Tribunal, and as seen in Morrowind, Sotha Sil wasent looking too good. The Tribunal temple is in shambles. The major religion of the Tribunal temple had lost all of its Gods and Nerevarine had defeated Dagoth Ur and proved the beliefs of the Tribunal as false.

Following was the Oblivion crisis in which i believe I read Ald'ruhn was destroyed by the Daedra. But in the long run

Next important chain of events. With the weakening of the Empire, the capital. House Telvanni is said to be all but destroyed. The last of the Telvanni boarded ""The Pride of Tel Vos"" whose remains can by found in Skyrim. House Redoran's capital was destroyed during the Oblivion crisis but it still has Blacklight on the mainlaind, though it was mentioned in Oblivion that it was under attack by Orcs and Nords from the west and the ash from the Red Mountain most likely had a major effect on the city. Theres nothing of House Hlaalu but they were most likely destroyed in the eruption. House Indoril and Dres were most likely destroyed in the Argonian invasion as they were in the Morrowind heartland and southern Morrowind. 

Many Dunmer fled to Solsthiem after these two events. I'm going to assume there's a strong presence there but only in the southern half as they north is uninhabitable. The others fled to West. There's an unwelcome Dunmer population in Eastern Skyrim. I'm assuming many fled to Cyrodiil, Dagon Fel in the north and the other mid sized islands in the area are currently unknown. 

So what now? The Great Houses and formed the Dunmer political system for the past 4 eras are eliminated and their religion is extinct. They either went back to their ancestor worship system

As they walked and sang and chuckled the shell-homes of the Devils crumbled and fell though the dwarves who made their homes of rock would fight and hide and fight again until not even they knew if the battle was over. With Voice came power and with power came safety and with safety came ignorance. Shor applauded from afar as the Dwemer died yet kept quiet as the Devils were crushed and is still confusing as the Dagoth Devil rarely made complaint.

Before them came the Red Mountain.

The battle was harsh, raced up the mountainside on the Faith-Cat who may not have been there. As the Tongues crushed and burned and froze and ripped the heroes above fought these evils: Dumac Dwarfking, Vehk the Devil, Moon-and-Star (whose hands spoke destiny, whose father was the serpent-shadow of Shor, whose shield-wife was many-faced) and Devil Dagoth whose loyalty is obscured to all. As the terrible fighting continued, both spirit-of-Shor and Wulfharth were defeated and Kyne had to lift the ashes from Hell, and back to the home of Snow-Throat. 

When Jurgen saw this and the deaths of many other Tongues he cried out to the winds but had a dead throat. He saw, to return to the land which was made theirs to reflect on this.

Year 1

200 or Some More days of refusing to Shout

Year 2

Jurgen walked with Mora Bellysinger to the new city of Markarth, which is forgotten. Windcaller and Bellysinger entered the Stone Palace of Nchuand-Zel and looked upon the symbols and metal-men of the Dwemer, which were hatred and ignorance. Mora was boiling with rage and shouted the metal into bends and peices of those both living and not, Jurgen chose to sit down on the cold stone as more of the metal-men surrounded them until they had no escape when Jurgen hummed deep and soft. The humming of Jurgen shook the stone and the metal men until even their false symbols could not save them.

Mora had then chosen to stay silent with Jurgen until she would sing with him

Year 3

Mora had died. Jurgen had been depressed since and sat in the mud-ponds of Eastmarch, his world, his life and his faith. Violently he had been pulled back by Mikjir Mud-Eater, whom thought he walked upon a man ready to drown himself. The friends greeted each other by ways of the hand and Mikjir was confused by Jurgen's silence; he had decided to bite into the mud-pond and spit towards Jurgen though the mud slid off him with ease. New life was not thrown into him, for new life had already begun.

Year 4

This year has never been sung

Year 5

Jurgen stayed in Hillgrund's Steading until he was gifted with 20 bottles of Mede from the town's marketers and 5 jars of honey from Sveinhelf Seven-Toes, whose name is told later, and she stared deeply at Jurgen who was still confused. The pilgrim knocked him down ruthlessly, then kissed Jurgen, whose lips were sweet with honey, then fell into the snow for later travellers to find. He still did not know, but he would learn later.

Year 6

Jurgen had made himself a small ice-home near the place Winds Allow None as it would briefly be known. Stuck before he could reach the peak

Year 7

Jurgen was allowed passage through the winds, he had wondered why he would have risen so high to be dropped down into an outcast above a mountain, until Jurgen could teach Paarthurnax the true words of power.

MUL THU'UM FUNT

These are the words that comfort Paarthurnax when he tries to remember his power.

Jurgen would refuse to fight them and Fjorli became irritated so began to Shout towards Jurgen; and as she did the many others joined her in deafening and thundering Thu'um.

Jurgen stood, weary and fatigued as they dropped into the snow where the warning had layed and they still did not know what he had. Jurgen calmly walked towards the Tongues and whispered to them.

So my theory is that only willing dragons are capable of being soul trapped. Now as we all know it is impossible to soul trap dragons. Originally I had thought that this was just Gameplay but then I thought about how the dragonborns were so valued for being the ultimate dragon slayer because they could absorb the soul of a dragon and how if it was possible for anybody to just soul trap a dragon and prevent them from being resurrected that way then they wouldn't be so valued. Which would make you think that dragons can't be soul trapped except for the fact that our Dragonborn (who has the soul of a dragon) gets soul trapped himself

I'm unsure exactly how Durnehviir got into the soul cairn but considering he isn't undead himself it's possible that he was also soul trapped and as he went in there as part of a deal with the Ideal Masters he obviously would have been willing.

The Orcs ( sometimes referred to by the elves as 'Orsimer', in the Wrothgarian mountains of High Rock. The orcs have long been resented by the other species of Tamriel, both for their xenophobic culture and their strange appearance.

Even though the Orcs find their heritage in the Aldmeri settlers who followed the god Trinimac (which will be explained later), and where the mer have a slender and agile build, the Orcs are very big and broad, which also accounts for their incredible strength.  
They have a green skin colour, with their lower incisors forming in upright tusks, making it almost impossible for Orcs to fully close their lips.  
The Orcs have a slight resistance to Magicka

As stated earlier, to convince the Orsimer and Chimer of the power of the Daedra. The followers of Trinimac were then cursed, and turned into the currently seen Orcs. When this happened is unknown, but, since the Orcs were already changed at the start of the First Eras, it should have been in the late Merethic Era. Some time after this transformation, Trinimac reappeared as the Daedric prince Malacath, the Orcs hold great respect for this Daedric prince

The society of the Orcs is based around the Codes of Malacath, fighting valiantly and the importance of your tribe and family, along with the idea that isolation is a blessing. These codes have shaped Orcish culture to what it is now today.  
Seeing their views on isolation, and the only women in the stronghold are directly affiliated to him (as mother, wife or daughter). This rule does not apply to male inhabitants. The chief has multiple wives, some of which have their own role in the stronghold (for instance, the second wife is called the 'forge wife', and oversees the armour and weapon forging of the stronghold). The daughters of the chieftain are given or traded to other chieftains, as a sign of goodwill and to prevent inbreeding.  
Family is incredibly important to the Orcs, followed directly by their same-sex parent. In case the same-sex parents is unknown, the child gets the name of the other-sex parent.  
Just like the Nords of Skyrim, they take great piride in both their smithing and their personal strength.  

Their relation with the other species on Tamriel is troubled at best. The Orcs do not see the need to shape themselves to other cultures, and the long lasting conflict for territory, and the elves for their use of magic (the Orcs see killing from afar as a sign of weakness). This despise towards other races also strengthens the despise they feel for the Orcs.  
As troubled as the relations of the Orcs are, has been target of many attacks by the other kingdoms, which at some point united just to destroy it.

The Orcs are some of the best armourers and warriors in all of Tamriel. There armour is fabled as being incredibly strong, a somewhat rare metal found throughout Western Tamriel.  
As strong as their armour is, the Empire has employed them as front-men in the legion. Their service in the legion made them a bit more accepted in the Empire (especially in Cyrodiil), but they are still seen as pariah by the fast majority (indeed, many people still believe the Orcs are actually kin to the goblins).

As stated earlier
Somewhere in the First Era, and destroyed Orsinium in 1E 980.  
Over the next centuries, until Gortwog gro-Nagorm created the new kingdom of Orsinium in 3E 399. Through Gortwog's excellent diplomacy and politics, Orsinium prospered without major armed conflicts, but was still not officially recognised by the Empire. During the Warp in the West, Orsinium was one of the four kingdoms to use the Numidium to gain territory and swore fealty to the Empire. After almost 400 years under Imperial control, the status of Orsinium as independent province was finally in sight, until it was yet again sacked during the early fourth era, and many Orcs fleeing east.

---

One of the constant themes of TES games is that an insignificant prisoner whose defining trait is unimportance (this is somewhat tongue-in-cheek, remembers, recognizes or cares what they look like until they are thrust into the prophecy) ends up becoming the most significant and important person in their respective stories. Disregarding destiny in the form of the Elder Scrolls as writer fiat, this seems somewhat arbitrary. If a perfect nobody could end up slaying gods, embody a cosmic principle or destroy world-destroyers, why can't it be somebody else? They have no fundamental motivation to pursue such hardship, since they have neither pre-established memory from which to guide future actions nor predisposed feelings and beliefs which incline them to respond to their situation. They themselves don't know what these are until the immediate situation requires them to realize them -- an existential ambiguity represented in the form of (player) choice.

Aside destiny, after all. But this would conflict with the fact that the player character/s make many countless choices (or perhaps they *are* choices). For a prophecy to be true and have any sort of worth, it needs to happen in the end. While the specific terms and conditions may vary, nothing that contradicts with that statement can be true. What meaning is destiny that doesn't come to be? Retrospectively, that's just a conjecture or a possibility. Yet, the player character/s are those conjectures and possibilities -- they can contribute to the apotheosis of a death-defiling god, become the protector and director of an ancient order of freelance executioners, or whatsoever on. They can do all of these things

But there is still one world. Different choices do not rewrite the world-in-entirety each time they occur. One of the most significant and blatant things that happened to address this is the Warp in the West. Destiny as foretold by the Elder Scrolls is still told the same

The premise of the rant so far is this: destiny is the quality that makes the Hero Prisoner/s significant

A proposed solution to this incongruity is this: the distinction is imaginary. As imaginary as the supposed gap between identity-as-self and universality-as-Godhead, this could be seen as an anteroactive revision of a retroactive revision. Warp in the West occurred not for the sake of resolving timeline conflict, but because the Agent was always ""meant"" to ""end up"" causing.

In the Elder Scrolls universe, which in turn changes the once-present. The Hero Prisoner -- the ambiguous nobody -- is the vehicle of this effect: because they have no past, they are the most sensible ones to manifest the past that evolves according to the future. Certain other entities in the universe might also reflect this nature of destiny, such as once-mortal Vehk who is also always-god Vehk.

The Hero Prisoner/s always had, in which they can simultaneously do everything they choose to do and nothing they can't choose to do at once. The unimportant Hero Prisoner is made important because their unimportance makes them important.

**tl;dr #1**: For a reality where future can influence the past through prophecies and destinies

---

So the rambling so far explains the more agreeable understanding of the Elder Scrolls series of mine. But the main motivation to make this post is elaborated here

The theory is this: The Hero Prisoner/s *are* the Elder Scrolls. They are the points in universe that change past

When their story is told, is the only one that truly has agency. Simultaneously, the only one that truly has agency is destiny, in the form of the Elder Scrolls.

This pushes this idea further into the fringe and I fear mentioning this concept again, reality isn't exactly real. The impossible nature of a free agent in a universe where future already exists is made possible by an alien intervention that goes beyond the parameters of that universe.

The player character is the Elder Scrolls because what they do and are is destiny.

**tl;dr #2**: The Elder Scrolls series is named after its main character. The various Hero Prisoners that are revealed in the games are one constant and consistent being.

---

*An Aside*

I realize that this is contentious to think of CHIM as a meta mechanic (such as it being console commands or fourth-wall breaking), only microscopic portions of them are revealed, leading to limited understanding that make the world convincing -- a universe populated by nothing but buddhas would be unintriguing. But the player considers everything in their entirety, having a perspective that is impossible and incomprehensible to (most of) the characters.

But, after all.

I thought that there might be invisible tears that led to Oblivion and that magick was what held everything together, not forces we know today. I thought that Nirn and all the other plane(t)s orbited Magnus, just like planets do but with all our terms for the forces replaced with magick. Then I learned about the Godhead and all that and I thought my theories were solidified because if the universe of TES was based off of the real world by some being then surely everything works the same, just with magick keeping everything moving.

Andre Granius

**Introduction:**

The Bosmer (Wood Elves) are not known for their maritime tradition

The Green Pact, and it affects life in Valenwood even today. For instance, the Green Pact forbids the use of any plant matter, alive or dead, for personal or societal benefit. Therefore, the entirety of Bosmeri culture is built upon what seems, at first, they only eat meat—including people

Due to the Green Pact, sail ships built of imported wood, but the sole use of foreign ships and local ships built of imported materials would simply be inefficient. Ships built of insect materials, such as those of the Dunmer (Dark Elves) and Maormer (Sea Elves), are out of the question as well, for the ships of both races do include some small quantity of wood in their design, and such huge insects as are needed are not native to Valenwood. Even the legendary ships of the Altmer (High Elves), light, Bosmeri mages capable of constructing such craft are few and far between.

The Bosmer are spared the fate of naval mediocrity by the Maritime Provision, states:

“When Y’ffre and the proto-Bosmer negotiated the Green Pact, and the proto-Bosmer knew that they would have to fight against them if Valenwood was to stand at all.

Y’ffre thought and thought and thought, take a piece of Valenwood with them even when they went to sea, and spread seeds of more mundane trees and plants wherever the ships went. These trees, the Rellyeis in my tongue, were one of Y’ffre’s many gifts to the Bosmer.”


**Growth Cycles and Other Details**

Whether genuinely given to the Bosmer by Y’ffre as a provision of the Green Pact or created by some magical prodigy forgotten by history, have a very complex life cycle. A given Rellye begins its life as a sapling growing on a coastline or riverside, and in general, it is half as thick as a Bosmer’s arm length from the  moment it sprouts from the ground. During the first stage of its life, the tree simply grows, spreading its roots, widening its trunk, be it lake, depending on the conditions of the tree’s surrounding environment. The Rellye continues growing even after this initial period

Once it is as thick as one and a half arm lengths, the Rellye grows a variety of water faring vessels. In the second stage, the tree grows small boats, such as rowboats, canoes, faerings, shallops, and only rarely stored within seafaring vessels. The boats are truly a boon to the Bosmeri people, considering the Bosmeri appreciation for individuality, the fruit set expands as a roughly spherical shape. The fruit drops into the water

At a thickness of two and a half arm lengths, with the exceptions that fewer fruit grow at any one time than in the second stage, that each fruit grows for a year, sometimes two, and that each fruit bears a stem and leaf which protrude together from a small opening near the crown. Later, as the fruit unfurls in the water over a period of eight to twelve months, the stem is shed and the leaf grows into a sail. The product is a small ship, each ship is different. In fact, a sailor cannot leave one ship and sail another as well as the first. With a new ship, and intricacies of one ship are most often drastically different from those of another. However

After at least half a century of growth in the third stage, again, all the same, but everything is larger and takes longer. The fruit grow for as long as five years and unfurl within three. And, at this point, only one fruit grows upon the Rellye at a time. The products of this stage are equivalent to the products of the third stage, except greater in size. The ships produced in this stage are frigates, wide-bellied trading ships, like the dwellings upon the famous walking city of Falinesti—celebrate for days and sometimes weeks on end, are a complete unknown. As such

The Bosmeri shipwrights most often plant Rellyeis—through some secret ritual with inexplicably found seeds—along riversides and lake shores, for the ships of the third and fourth stages must be able to leave the rivers and lakes in which they unfurl. Occasionally, either due to poor planning or changes in river flow, some of the products of the Rellyeis are trapped within their lakes or rivers. Such trapped ships can only be pushed to shore or left to float.

**Maritime Implications**

Despite the saying, or other commodity] doesn’t grow on trees”—for example, “Daedric armor doesn’t grow on trees”—and the fact that Bosmeri ships literally grow on trees, the Bosmer are not known for maritime superiority or an excess of seafaring vessels. Without consideration of the Rellyeis, the cause of their naval weakness would seem obvious; building a fleet solely of imported wood would be a nearly impossible endeavor. With consideration of the Rellyeis, the cause is less sure. The difficulty the Bosmer have with the concepts of military hierarchy and organization and the like (such as that within a fleet or a navy), the lack of a strong centralized government within Valenwood, slow production rate, and certainly not the best of Maormeri fleets.

There has only ever been one exception to that rule of Valenwood’s maritime weakness. As dictated by Thaewen

“As with many great exceptions in Bosmeri history, Haymon pushed the Rellyeis to produce better ships, faster. He disregarded uniqueness and promoted efficiency, and as a whole he labored to ensure that he would have the fleet necessary to fight against the Empire in his march of conquest.

The crowning jewel of Haymon’s fleet was the *Water Lily*, became Haymon’s mansion and castle at sea. Within, the *Water Lily* was a veritable labyrinth of locules and passageways. Haymon ultimately rode the *Water Lily* to the Battle of Firewaves in the Iliac Bay, where it was set alight, burned to cinders, and lost at the bottom of the Bay. The Breton forces in the naval battle had put fire to heavy use, for it was—and still is—a powerful weapon in combating Bosmeri ships.

The Rellyeis, and their ships do not usually grow into one another. The Rellyeis are ‘just’ trees, after all, and the ships, as compared to mundane fruit such as apples, normally do not grow after they have dropped from their respective Rellyeis. Haymon Camoran’s methods behind the construction of his fleet are uncertain. Pro-Haymon sources claim that he conferred with the Rellyeis, or with the Spriggans, and after he did so, by employing the same magical techniques that the Telvanni use to grow their mushroom towers. Such an act would be a terrible crime, to warp them.

In the end, so that the Bosmer could not build a new navy every decade as Haymon had. The only survivors were those Rellyeis which lay in backwater ponds and inaccessible tributaries. The Rellyeis have been purged in such a manner several times throughout history. Most often, the Maormer were the perpetrators. The last purge as perpetrated by the Maormer occurred during the Interregnum; more specifically, it occurred during the reign of the Altmer King Hidellith, roughly one hundred years before his death. It should be noted that even upon his death, the Rellyeis had barely recovered, and that they would not recover fully until yet another hundred years had passed. As the Maormeri fleet departed from Valenwood, an Altmeri fleet followed that of the Maormer to Pyandonea,,

**Falmer language**

When comparing Falmeris to Ayleidoon one can see many similarities. Words such as ""ye"" (and)

Ayleid - Umaril

Falmer - Gelebor

Therefore if the language is similar we can go further and attest that their culture and origins are similar. If so then I'd go and say that the Falmer are actually the Northern subgroup of the larger Ayleid culture. From this we can extract that the Falmer had a similar if not exact replica of the Ayleid pantheon with the same amount of reverence for Magnus

**Dwemer language**

Dwemeris is the most alien of the languages of Tamriel. It's spellings and it's names are different to any other language of Tamriel and it's connection to Aldmeris is faint. Names such as Kagrenac

The reason for such a language is unknown but I conclude in saying that the language was a construct of the Dwemer just like everything else in their society. The Dwemer probably found a problem with Aldmeris and so built a new and better one just like they did with their animinculi.

**Tamrielic language tree**

I will not even pretend to know what that means. I postulate, leading me to conclude that ""thuamer"" may have been the Dwemer word for Snow Elf. Furthermore, ""aka"" is a very specific word that is almost always associated with dragons. Seeing it next to ""mora"" denotes that (if mora is indeed a common meric word) it is referring to ""dragon"" and ""Forest"", perhaps a reference to the Nords of Atmora, who, with the roaring voices of dragons drove the Falmer deep underground to trust themselves into the twisted mercy of the Dwemer.

Some random words that stuck out because they reminded me of things were: ""irkngth"", Irkingthad and Raldbthar, and Kagren because it's most of Kagrenac's name. 

On to the Falmeri portion. I bolded the words we can translate with some degree of accuracy and left the untranslatable words unbolded.

""**ye sa sou meldi** *calne* **tarn va molagnensaliye** *trumbi* **nou bala** *ilpen* **av sou meldi** *nagaiale* **as** *guntumnia spantelepelaelia* **arani morae ye sou** *liebali racurane* **ye nu** *rautane sye* **ye nu** *hautalle* **nou buroi** *gune* **sou** *gravuloi* **sa** *metane sye garlis frey* **as** *gondra doemera* **tarcel lane sou agea** *silya* **nu** *hecta* **sou arcten** *rias* **nu** *nemalanta ge* **nu** *hecta* **sou** *epe* **gandra** *rias* **ne** *nemelauta ge* **nu** *frey sepe sye* **arcta varlor** *denai cullei noue staneiaye* **ry sou** *alasil auta* **ry loria** *shenta* **abagaiavoy malautavoy** *fey* **nou** *darre* **ye** *alata rou* **malae asma** *maraga* **sou anyamis av** *serven* **ye** *getheng* **sou** *wend riarilia vey emeratu* **sou oia** *besia.*""

Now, we can translate a good bit of the Falmer text.

""**and so your driven ... pass in our halls of fire ... our power ... of your driven ... by ... ... kings of the wood and your (...-stones, most likely acknowledge) ... you ... ... ... ... you ... gifts ... you ... ... you ... ... ... acknowledge cast-dark ... ... ... ... as you ... ... as darkness ... I do not fear the (High-..., or untranslatable) ... our ... and ... ... high by what ... your life of ... and ... your ... ... ... ... your eternal ...**

Now we leave what leave what little certitude we had and stray into conjecture. 

IF both the Dwemer script and the Falmer script have the same meaning in two different languages

It appears to describe the fall of the Falmer Empire, to the ""halls of fire"" belonging to the Dwemer, where the Dwemer recount their enslaving of the Falmer. It specifically mentions ""acknowledge"" and ""dark"" several times, leading me to believe that the latter half is the story of the Dwemer forcing the Falmer into slavery by their blindness, or forcing their blindness upon them. The Dwemer brag a bit at the end, calling themselves ""eternal"", perhaps ""eternal masters"". 

It's always baffled me why this Rosetta Stone exists, to remind the Falmer of how they got into this state. The lower of the two scripts is the stylized and beautiful Falmeri script, easily recognizable due to the intricacies of each letter. Falmer who passed by could likely read it as braille, which also explains why the Falmeri portion of the text reads like someone telling someone ""this is your lot in life"". The use of ""you"" and ""your"" is incredibly telling, and shows just how sadistic the Dwemer could be. That was rubbing moon sugar into an open wound, if you will. It's no wonder the Betrayed rebelled and hate all living things now. If I had to change one of my previous guesses, I would change ""thua"" to mean ""you"" or ""your"", now you are our slaves

The 'sky' (or space) is actually Oblivion which in turn encompasses us from Aetherius

Now:

* Sovngarde is in Aetherius yet it is ruled by Shor (Lorkhan). So why isn't it a 'planet' floating in Oblivion?

* Where are the Daedric planes? Do they have 'planets' too?

* I read somewhere that the Aldmeri Dominion are trying to destroy all the towers to become godlike. But before them mer were building towers to ascend to god-hood. This confuses me.

* Alduin eats the world starting a new Kapla. Does he eat Mundus? Or just Nirn? Did he decide to just rule the Nords for a while before he would eat them? Why does Alduin do this? Is it all borked now because the Dragonborn killed him? Or will Alduin return to do his thing?

* What happens if all the Pillars are destroyed/de-activated?

* Do pillars have any other effect apart from tethering Nirn.

* What do they tether Nirn to?

* What is the eye of the Magnus? Is it actually a space robot? If it is does that mean this Kapla is super long because civilization managed to get into space?

* What would this space robot mine if there isn't actually anything in 'space'?

* Why do some consider Pelinal a cyborg?

[The first page of the Divine forsaken book](http://images.uesp.net/e/e0/Mysterium_Xarxes_P1.jpg) displays the infamous 'O' in the center of a circle surrounded by daedric script. The script that follow the axis of the circles edge read as so:

*For lord Dagon Forever reborn in blood and fire from the waters of Oblivion*

Now, lest you displease them. Maybe this script is to bring Dagon's focus on you and place interest in your current affairs/goals.

The left text holds itself in a wrangled mess

*When I walo the earth again thef_a ith fulamong ou_sha_llre*

This is when we can deduce that this is written from Dagon's point of view. It lacks proper grammar along with actual words. Though barely translatable

The writings on the right go as so:

*above all other mortals forever. Ceiveour reward tobeset*

Now this is a little tricky. The first part is distinguishable and gives us a clear statement. The second

* the roht in forever is carried in into the beginning

This is the final elusive statement of the first page to Dagon's prophecy/summoning rites. One can assume that might is actually suppose to translate as mighty (Y is not used in common daedric script and it's presence is assumed by the spacing). The last word may potentially be tremble

I do hope this is a good translation to run on. My lore on Dagon still has a few wholes in it and might very well have affected the text in a negative way. I shall be *",,t5_2t5ay,False,,Telvanni,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/15gbha/from_the_deserts_of_rust_and_wounds_to_camorans/

Ostensibly, I can understand that.

But what of the ancient Nordic Tongues


This leads into my question: My understanding of the Voice, but under this model, saying ""PLEASE PASS THE MAMMOTH CHEESE"" shouldn't trigger an automatic clearing of the dinner table at Heljarchen. 

That being said, which was taken from the Aldmer. And if not, did they speak their own proto-nordic language? 

And if they did, then why the gags? And furthermore, why do the rest of the Greybeards not speak in Tamrielic, as does say, Ulfric?",,False,t5_2t5ay,True

It's been a great week- lots of very interesting threads and good discussions, and of course Regalnerd's [The Time God Conspiracy](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/11iqga/the_time_god_conspiracy/). We also gained 83 new scholars, so if you are new *please* go ahead and read the New Scholar's Guide to the Subreddit and the FAQ, both of which can be found on the sidebar.

It's also been a very busy week for us moderators. Prince-of-Plots, that actually very shortly about to start.

The subreddit is about to get a whole new look, 3 all new flairs, and more excitingly an *IRC Channel*- thanks to Abhorsen469!


Hope you like all those new changes! Starved and Prince-of-Plots have worked very hard to create this new design

With that all good and done, here are the results:

---

The voting was very, b-rad-oleary, Voryn, and OrneryCretin.

The two most popular nominees were Regalnerd and Lilrhys- which both got much support from the other scholars. After a final tallying of the vote

Please

I and the rest of the moderation team would like to welcome Lilrhys into the Elder Council

So that is pretty much it for what I have to say. New scholars remember to read the New scholar's guide and the FAQ

When the new design and subreddit improvements are put into place go ahead and give us any feedback you might have about the new design, etc.

I'm sorry for not having a scholar of the week in the last two community threads

That's really all I have to ask of you. I've already repeated what you are supposed to do in the comments a few times too many, post it, if you have suggestions, say'em, go ahead and do whatever. 

Keep on postin' and most of all have a great weekend!

* Check my lore.  We don't know where the Skyforge came from
* Do my cryptic references to historical events and the gods make sense?
* Do you like it or

---------------------------------------------------

**EDIT III: I've made changes to the lyrics.  The events take place just after the flight of the Aedra.  Kyne will play a role.  I've kept Cold Iron as a male and am debating whether to make the Sun female or gender-neutral.  I'm not sure if I'm going to stay that way, what Cold Iron truly loves is the light of Aetherius, and it will be the joining with that light that will create the Skyforge and the first Skyforge Steel.  Really, the first steel of any kind.  True-steel.  All other steel is a copy of True-steel.  In addition, this will explain why the elves fear the Skyforge.  It is connected with Kyne, the widow of Shor, the enemy of elves and friend of men.**

--------------------------------------------------

Here's what I have so far:

* Brave warrior men
* Bold women
* Please lend this lonely (wand'ring) bard your ear
* For one brief span and you shall hear
* Of how
* The Skyforge came to be
* **'Ere Tiber Septim found the voice**
* **To bring men in one fold**
* **'Ere Ysgramor
* **Returned to Northern Tamriel**
* **With full 500 warriors fell**
* **The Skyforge
* When Massa and Secunda danced
* On heaven's new-formed bier
* When men were born and Aedra fled
* From newborn Nirn
* And heartless,
* The Skyforge
* **In those first days the world was wild**
* **The throes of Nirn's new birth**
* **When moonstone dripped on Tamriel**
* **And under ashen Vvardenfell**
* **Glass and Ebon god's-blood dwelled**
* **Cold Iron walked the earth**
* Cold Iron
* And common as the grass
* Cold Iron
* Cold Iron
* More steadfast
* .Than ebony or glass.
* **How long Cold Iron roamed the dark**
* **As untold eons fly**
* **Until
* **The urge to look up came to him**
* **And up looked Iron's face most grim**
* **To gaze into the sky.**
* And there
* The Sun upon her throne
* Her face
* And to the earth descended beams
* Of blessing flowing forth in streams
* Upon the earth
* **He stood there
* **Descended into night**
* **And thinking her forever gone**
* **Not knowing of the coming dawn**
* **Cold Iron mourned until the morn**
* **The dying of the light**
* But Light returned
* The Sun returned to reign
* Relieved
* And shouted his undying love
* 'Till coming evening made him move
* Into a darkened pain.
* **So
* **Thus following his heart**
* **'Till she
* **Then sank again to even's place**
* **And Iron
* **That they might never part.**
* A widowed
* Cold Iron's race wear on. 
* Each day the same worn path he'd tread
* Unheeding with an upturned head
* His footpath wore a riverbed
* Into the new-formed sod.  

The end of the story is that

Thus it is that, from his body.  And the place where they met became the Skyforge, with the eagle that carried their messages ever watching over their meeting place.

The Bosmer would praise you, the Thalmor would tolerate you, and it would be such an incredible territory to explore. Increasing conflict between the Bosmer and Thalmor due to the player character could be a huge new stepping stone in the progression of the Empire's rebuilding. This idea can be taken even farther.

You could easily start out in the traditional prisoner role too. Thrown in the brig for some unknown reason when you are identified as the coming of Y'ffre and released.

One, is it almost like the end of a kalpa, and things are recreated and go back to Convention 1.0? This seemed unlikely, as at that point Nirn had already been created and the races of men and mer would eventually spring up (or am I wrong about this?). 

Additionally, thus reinforcing the Mundus by becoming a new Tower. Would eliminating the worship of Talos somehow weaken Convention 1.0 (I have no idea how this even makes sense to be honest!), allowing for the deactivation of the first tower?

The following story was told to me by an Imga. Most of you have probably only heard about the Great Apes of Valenwood from their single mention in the Pocket Guide to the Empire. As someone who lived among them for quite sometime (I was forced to bathe twice-daily)

This story takes place after the Oblivion Crisis but before the Great War. I cannot testify to the truth of the tale, the tale as told to me, came replete with excessive hand gestures, grunts of inflection, and at times even physical contact to bring me into the story. While I would like to think my writing is capable of jumping off the page, it will certainly pale in comparison to that.

**Chapter 1: Malcontent**
Watching, hanging there. Eternity passed. Stomach growled; damned Daedra.

Rustling in the detritus; not far away. I see it slithering: spotted pit!gon! More waiting now

Directly below me. Falling now; toes grabbing, and break. Cruh!UNCH! I win.

Beat it on the tree

Fold it in half. Time to go home. Snake was heavy. Eighty pounds at least. Joff’s people would eat well.

Moving through the forest like the wind. Turning

Home is just up ahead. No drumming coming from the clearing. Stupid Gorf. Keep playing

Then

In my home!

Throw the snake first. Good effect. Leap in after it, grunt. Pause. Beat the floor and beat my chest. Make them scared. Now stop.

Five Imperials I can see

“Why here!?” I demand. “This place belong to Duke Joff and Imga. No man-pigs.”

Puff out your chest. Show him you’re big.

“What did it say?” commander man-pig asks vomit-sack. “I can’t understand those monkey grunts. The shaved Imga in the trees are bad enough. These wild things though...”

Vomit-sack responds: “It says its name is Joff. It doesn’t want you here.”

“Ah

Anger boils. “No taxes! No Empire! Fuh!UHCK! Mede!”

Vomit-sack begins to translate.Commander Man-pig cuts him off:: “I got that part.” Makes voice slow again. “Right

Gorf must have argued. Explains shouting. Wouldn’t have to beat him. ‘Least not hard. “Duke Joff to you man-pig...”

Not listening. Man-pig waves its naked hands. Smelly creatures start to move. Rummaging through our things.

Rage smoulders. Kill them? Others hiding. Can smell more. Can't see more. None can escape. Army will follow. Must wait.

Man-pigs take mostly shinies. By Jiffer it's Dumb! Stupid dung-men. Ale. Mead. Wine. Rare skins. Finest drums in Tam!RUGH! Joff’s treasure is endless. Fools can have gold. Maybe taxes not so bad.

“The don’t have much sir

“Not for back taxes. Take the alcohol too

Man-pig looks at snake. It’d better not. Uglier than a shaved Imga it is.

“And take that snake. I’ve never seen one so big. That should be worth a fine price at market.”

Fury explodes! KILL THEM! No. Can’t. Must wait. 

**Chapter 2: The Great Awakening**

Walking now. Up

At the top. Bosmer everywhere. Annoying little things. Can’t help but trip on ‘um. Worse

Crossing bridges. Wood creaks and sways. Too heavy. Not made for Imga these. Stupid to live up here really. Too easy to fall. 

The detritus is soft and wet. Still

Shaved-ones walk by. Little group. Looking at Joff like a man-pig. Dumb stupid Imga

Bosmer singing nearby. Trying to convince the vines to be a house. Plants have been stubborn since the Daedra came. Jiffer taught the wood-folk to sing. Still

Here now. Mulch district. Stench not so bad. Man-pigs avoid this place. Quick little fingers find their pockets. Joff has no pockets. No worries.

Building up ahead. Beautiful really. Vines lock. Twist and hug. Making walls. Hard to tell where tree stops and house beings. Beautiful. Won’t tell them that.

Approach. Voices inside. Joff steps too loud. Voices stop. Enter. Only one person to see now.

“Ah

Joff ignores questions. “Duke Joff

“Hm...? Here? Why

“Bah!RUNK!” Voice booms. Ear-wain steps back. “No lies little-one. Joff hears.”

Voice shaking: “Err...oh

Puff up chest. Show him you’re big. “It lies badly. Joff smells. No vomit. No dung. No sour sweat. Joff comes looking for advice. Willing to pay to find man-pig camp. Joff can’t trust you.” Leaving now. Find someone better.

“Wait!” Ear-wain calls out. “Do you mean to say you are asking for directions to the Imperial fort?”

Stopping. “Joff has said. Man-pigs insult Duke Joff. Pay-back.”

Magic. Out of nowhere. Out of the walls. Been here the whole time. Altmer fellow. Fancy robe. Shiny hood.

Nod to him. Won’t bow and grovel like the shaved-ones. Still. Altmer smell nice. 

Fancy-fellow comes over: “I think you and I can be of use to each other friend.” 

**Chapter 3: The Calm**

Heading home. Carrying free ale barrel. Payment for services. Dark forest. Careful not to drop it.

Near home

Close now. Just beyond the trees. Joff’s great land before him. Dozens mighty Imga. Many kids too. Drummers drum and beat on trees. Making noise. Let the world know mighty Joff is gone. Help mighty Joff find his way home.

Enter clearing. Say nothing. Do nothing. Wait. Slowly

Walk up to him. Get in his face. Let him know he’s small. Breathe hard. Puff out lips. Finally

“What happen?”

Slap him hard. No questions. Let him turn his face back. Slap him again. Never speak first. Joff explains:

“We go to war.”

Moment of silence. Just one. Then

Joff slams down ale barrel. Pop the top. Others grab more barrels. Time to get ready. Chug the ale. Start the dance. Battle dance.

Beat your chest. Beat the ground. Hoot. Grunt. Holler. Joff runs circle around camp. Everyone stays back. Stop in front of Gorf again. Dare him. Gorf does nothing. 

Move to the center. Twirl. Others join the dance now. Beat begins to change. Other noisemakers join. The shakers. The clangers. Time to start the speech:

“Im!GUH!”

The call rings back

“Cru!USH! Sma!ASH! break and burn. That’s the way our enemies learn. Im!GUH! strong. Im!GUH! quick. Blood

Response: Hoots and hollers. Ready for war. Ready for blood. Ready to die. Beat changes once more. Find partners. More ale.

Gorf knows to stay put. Not allowed to dance. Joff grabs Irmuh

**Chapter 4: Hunger**

Up with the sun. Time to move out. Imga fly through the forest. Moving like wind. Hoots and hollers. Bang the trees. Bosmer move like rabbits. Quiet. Hiding. No one moves like Imga. Predators stay away.

Clearing ahead. Unnatural. Man-pigs cut down trees

Howling and yelping. Hoping their screams cause fear. Not doing it right. Jiffer taught them the words. Joff knows he did. Uncle Brom told him so. They forgot the words. Or can’t say ‘um right. Weak voices. Soft tongues. Imga do it right.

Into the clearing. Move to the front. Face the Bosmer. Find the leader. Pound the ground. Just once. Puff out your chest. Now wait. Hand goes up

“Rah!UHK!” 

Ground splits. Great scar. Walls crumble. Great hole. Man-pigs die. Great joy.

Moment pause. Bosmer silent, even with a good arm.

Through the hole. Imga follow. Bosmer right behind. More arrows. Magic sparks. Bright lights. Bodies fall

Grab the rocks. Bits of cement. Throw ‘um hard. Heads break. Other Imga help. Rocks and arrows batter man-pigs. Second wall breaks. Flesh not so strong as stone. Move in.

More man-pigs here. ‘Nother wall. Smaller this time. Most outside, no Gorf. Blood rage begins. 

Joff charges. Others follow. Knock ‘um down. Beat their heads. Take their swords. Smash their limbs. Make ‘um mush.

Big ‘feller charges Joff. Raises sword. Gorf grabs from behind. Breaks neck. Joff fumes.

All gone now. No more man-pigs inside. Bosmer outside

Down the stairs. Basement. Can’t go further. Big door. Locked. Imga beat it. Nothing. Gorf steps back. Runs. Throws himself on it. Nothing. Joff smiles. Thick wood. Won’t break. Sounds inside.

Joff speaks: “Move.” They move.

“Wool!OHD!”

Door shatters. Splinters fly. Frightened squeal. There he is. Commander Man-pig

Treasure room. Vast treasure. Not so vast as Joff’s of course. No drums. Mostly shinnies.

“Going?” Joff asks.

“Out of my way you dirty ape. I’ll kill you where you stand.” Voice shaking. Draws sword. 

Joff laughs: “Dance man-pig.” Others know to stay back.

Quick. Even in the metal skin. Moving left. Moving right. Twirls sword. Coming at me now

Slap his head. He stumbles. Move in

Grab his arms. Twist. Sword falls

Move in close. Face to face. Breathe on him. “Fuh!UHCK! Taxes. Fuh!UHCK! Empire. Fuh!UHCK! Mede.”

“Fal!UHM!”

Flesh burns. Smell even worse now. Cooked man-pig worse than goopy man-pig. He screams. Now pull. Arms tear free. Still connected

Grunts of approval from behind. We’ve won. Not worried about the ones outside.

There

**Editors Addendum**

I came Valenwood to study the Imga after the end of the Great War. My visa from the Thalmor officially states that I am here for cultural and biological studies. Indeed that was my intention. Yet

If the above tale is true

Like any good academic, what he did was an unnoteworthy act. He had no interest in the war of nations. He was simply righting a wrong that had been committed against him.

Thalmor sources would likely be equally unhelpful. Indeed

My last hope was the Bosmer. Unfortunately, had a large scar across his chest. He had clearly been stuck by a sword. Admittedly, he could have received the scar in a number of other ways besides fighting the Commander of Fort Moonmont. 

Still, was Joff’s discussion of what seemed to be a type of shouting. I theorized that this could some sort of Imga thu’um. When I asked my Imga hosts to demonstrate, they only laughed. When I asked, how the power worked--is it a type of magic?--they seemed confused. The only response I got is that it is important to remember the names of things. ",,False,,1364516131.0,t3_1b6jr7

**The First Page: History of Valenwood**

In 1E 0, and one that has never truly been repeated. 

King Eplear is fondly remembered by the Bosmer

It was in 1E 340 that Valenwood first had true political contact with the ascendant Empire of the Cyrodiils, the dedicated Alessian King Borgas of Skyrim, last of the line of Ysgramor, was keen to demonstrate his piety and follow in the footsteps of the rulers of Cyrodiil and High Rock with his own war against the elves. To this somewhat questionable end, he marched to Cyrodiil to urge war against the Camorans’ Valenwood.

It seems likely that Borgas, but resistance he definitely met. It is unclear whether Borgas ever got as far as Valenwood, or if his chosen foes found him first, but records agree that Borgas and many of his men were slaughtered by the Bosmeri weapon of last resort, the Wild Hunt. 

However it happened, however, the end of conflict with Empire, and even after the Alessian Order dissolved, skirmishes played out constantly along Valenwood’s borders. These battles became steadily more intense as Imperial forces, bolstered by Empress Herta’s Colovian acquisitions, pushed deeper and deeper into Bosmeri territory. Herta captured the province in 1E 2714

The Empire took quick and effective action to secure its gains and complete the emasculation of the Camoran Dynasty. Each of Valenwood’s greatest cities: Falinesti, Haven, Archen and Woodhearth, were granted independence, successfully breaking up the influential members of the Dynasty (most of whom were Treethanes of these cities) and appealing to the traditional, pre-Camoran tendency towards localised clans and tribes. This strategy ensured that even after the fall of the Second Empire in 2E 430, the Camorans could not repeat Eplear’s achievements and unite the now disparate Bosmer. With no strong leadership, the Khajiit and the Colovians.

This situation continued unchecked until 2E 830, invoked an obscure treaty (the validity of which has been disputed by contemporary and modern scholars) which lent stewardship of Valenwood to the Altmer in case of a dire threat to the kingdom’s integrity. The invasion of the Altmer in response forced back the Colovians and established the first Aldmeri Dominion, the most stable power in Tamriel until the Third Empire. Under the Dominion, Valenwood was ruled from Elden Root by an unpopular but pragmatically accepted coalition of Altmer and Bosmer known as the Thalmor (not to be confused with the modern Altmeri faction of the same name). It was at this time that the first (and only serious) attempt was made to “tame” Valenwood, with roads and infrastructure being built through the forest, resulting in an unprecedented (but short-lived) logistical efficiency in the Bosmeri homeland. 

Valenwood remained quietly prosperous under the Dominion until 2E 896 when, the process aided by Septim’s wise decision to allow the Bosmer their Tribal Council and Camoran king, and Valenwood was at peace, a “trophy province” over the Empire’s hearth.

But of course, better known as the Camoran Usurper, began a campaign to seize control of Valenwood and the Camoran throne, shrugging off his cousin and liege-lord Camoran Kaltos. The Usurper was ruthless and cruel, infamous for torturing captives and civilians, terrifying his enemies with bestial roars and summoned daedra, and allegedly raising the corpses of his enemies to fight for him, and the same promise carried his armies (more likely comprised of Bosmer and Redguard mercenaries than the daedra and undead of the legends) north

Following the failure of the Usurper’s revolt, returning to their clanhouses and deepwood villages. This “regression”, and the decades following were dangerous indeed for Valenwood, and its neighbours began to see it as a wounded animal. In the days of the Imperial Simulacrum (3E 389 – 3E 399), Valenwood, once again neglected by the Empire, was an easy target for the armies of Summerset and Elsweyr. It lost significant chunks of land to both nations in a series of regional conflicts

The exact starting point of the Five Years War is debated: the Bosmer claim it began in 3E 394 when Khajiiti bandits began attacking the timber caravans so essential to the Bosmer, the war was a bloody one which ran until 3E 399 at the cost of many lives. The Bosmer were initially successful, taking full advantage of the sudden adoption by the Khajiit of alien tactics proposed by Nord advisors, but once the armies of Elsweyr returned to their traditional techniques, Bosmeri forces were pushed back into Valenwood and all the way over the Xylo River. A short-lived truce was signed in 3E 397, only to be broken the same year by the Khajiit, pressing their advantage by crossing the river and razing Bosmeri hamlets. As with most wars with the Bosmer, where they remained. 

The War of the Blue Divide was perhaps more surprising, but it is often traced to the aggressive expansion of the Altmeri-backed Parikh Tribe in south-eastern Valenwood. From the very beginning the war’s result was a foregone conclusion – the Altmer had not only far superior infrastructure and military organisation, but one of the mightiest navies in Tamriel, and in a war fought across an ocean, the Bosmer had little hope. The war was over by the end of the year, and while the Altmer never invaded mainland Valenwood, they were successful in seizing several coastal islands that have remained Altmeri possessions ever since.

By the time of the Oblivion Crisis, Valenwood had almost ceased to exist as a unified entity. The Tribal Council was all but dissolved, having not met since the War of the Blue Divide, and the individual Bosmeri clans and tribes identified with no greater entity than themselves. In 3E 429, the Falinesti tree rooted itself in the north of the province, sparking a brief panic among its inhabitants. The tree lived on however, despite remaining static, albeit vastly changed to accommodate the lack of a southward migration.

The next year Valenwood’s upheaval continued with scattered reports of a Wild Hunt (although no Bosmer could report seeing or hearing of a Hunt being initiated), and he is revered almost as a saint even today.

Valenwood, the period of instability from 4E 0 to 4E 28 fuelled the increasing sentiment of dissatisfaction and neglect among the Bosmer, and in 4E 29, a contingent of Thalmor agents and their Bosmer allies launched a coup against Imperial rule. With the Mede Empire in its infancy, and chaos reigning across the continent, the Imperial presence in Valenwood was skeletal, and Bosmer loyalists were quickly defeated. The secession of Valenwood from the Empire marked the creation of the Aldmeri Dominion and the severing of all contact with the Empire. Needless to say, events in Valenwood are almost a total mystery


**Wagons of Timber: Economy and the Green Pact**

To the uneducated eye, the Bosmer abhor the very idea of such exploitation, and so no large-scale tree-felling has ever taken place in Valenwood, despite the efforts of Colovians and Khajiiti at various points throughout the ages.

While they refuse absolutely to cut their own, and it is this that makes the economy of Valenwood truly bizarre. Instead of the province’s major export, timber, naturally its most abundant natural resource, is its greatest *import*. From the first trade treaty with the Empire in 1E 340 (and perhaps earlier), the Bosmer have imported wagonloads of timber from the rest of Tamriel, and often (given the rarity of carpenters in Valenwood) the personnel to make use of it. In fact, whatever their wares

This system, and as a result Valenwood is a far less wealthy province than it otherwise might be. If it weren’t for the simplistic and self-sufficient nature of their society and culture, the Boiche might be said to live in poverty, possessing few of the luxuries taken for granted in provinces like Cyrodiil.

It is Valenwood’s craftsmer, and so they are a fairly reliable resource, somewhat comparable to traditional Nibenean ancestor silk. However popular these goods might be, they have never, with the possible exception of leather, been produced on a mass scale; they remain the preserve of small family workshops or collectives. This does increase the value of each sale, but of course also ensures that fewer sales are made.

Valenwood’s centres of wealth, and where strangers are around to buy them. Silvenar has long been home to the province’s finest leatherworkers and master craftsmer, as well as being the seat of the Silvenar, and so there is a continuous stream of revenue into the city of sap. The ports of Haven, Southpoint and Woodhearth are also, naturally, economic powerhouses (relatively speaking) with the steady stream of foreigners and merchants ensuring a circulation of Bosmeri goods.

The idea of an “economy” is something of a strange one for the Bosmer; they appear to have very little interest in the accumulation of wealth or, however, is the practical importance of certain goods, particularly their foreign timber shipments. When the Bosmer initiate a war or enter negotiations over this wood, it is not because they seek to cultivate their economy, but because they seek to build houses, or docks


**The Triarchy of Valenwood: Government and Politics of the Bosmer**

Broadly speaking, and the Silvenar. Each of these fulfils a separate function, although the less-than-rigorous design of the Bosmeri “state” means that there is often an overlap.

The King of Valenwood is a scion of the ancient Camoran Dynasty of King Eplear, the Dynasty has steadily increased in size to the point where it is almost a separate social class. In Valenwood, “nobility” and “Camoran” are all but synonymous, with the highest members of the family occupying the positions of King or Queen, and as Treethanes of the Dynasty (comparable to Nordic Jarls, each is “King” over one of Valenwood’s major cities, although only the Treethanes of Silvenar commonly use that title). The official role of the King of Valenwood is somewhat ill-defined, like Eplear himself, or a King of Alinor, but even when national pride is at its lowest

The Tribal Council is, essentially whenever enough members are in favour of a meeting. They may be days apart, or years apart, and can happen in any city of Valenwood, although Falinesti is the most popular venue. It is perhaps this branch of the triarchy that has the most direct influence over the Bosmer, as decisions made by the Council (which can cover almost any topic) will be brought back to the tribes and clans by their chieftains, to whom most Bosmer owe loyalty. That is not to say, that *every* chieftain is present in the Council – such a mass gathering would be impracticable – but typically the smaller clans will follow the lead of their closest (by geography or blood) tribe

Third, and his (or “their”, as the Bosmeri terminology more typically goes) role is to represent the will of the Bosmer as a people, specifically in dealing with outsiders. Travellers wishing for special permissions, for instance to pass through wartime borders, or establish a settlement in Valenwood, must petition the Silvenar, and any deviation from them

This perhaps is not extraordinary; many cultures have appointed people’s representatives, the Silvenar is quite unique. The Silvenar is the subject of a magical phenomenon never observed in any other context, whereby he actually embodies his people as a whole. When the Bosmer are powerful, or feel powerful, he will be large, muscular and strong. When many Bosmer have died, or they feel broken or defeated, he will friendly and accommodating to its members. In times of war he will display a powerful hatred for the enemy. His appearance and temperament can change overnight in the case of a significantly momentous event.

The phenomenon goes far deeper than physical appearance of course. Those who have met the Silvenar typically report being reminded of every Bosmer they have known, but the story of the first Silvenar is either unknown, or not shared with outsiders. It would appear that the secret of “creating” a Silvenar is still understood, at least to a practical degree, as a Silvenar lives only as long as any other Bosmer, at which point a new one is selected, often from the previous Silvenar’s family

There is no true hierarchy in this triumvirate of governance; in many ways, but by the same token, he must be loyal to his tribe, clan or king, as most Bosmer are. The King is ruler of all Valenwood, and so can, if he has the will and force of personality, including the tribal chieftains. But he also must accept that these chieftains have their eyes and ears throughout the kingdom

This system, is far less efficient than more conventional means of government. The lack of ordered hierarchy or absolute head means that the King, Council and Silvenar can contradict each other’s rulings or attempt to lead Valenwood in different directions. In most situations, it is the Silvenar’s word that stands, but this is because his word invariably reflects the feelings of the people on a given issue, not because he has authority over the other branches of government. Elven critics commonly cite this inefficiency of governance as one of the reasons why the Bosmer have never ruled an empire, and of the three branches, no concerted effort has *ever*, as with their inefficient but functional economy.

It is typically only when the power dynamic changes, it would seem, in every Dominion. But they never seem to have shown true *loyalty* to these bodies. The first and foremost obligations of a Bosmer are to Y’ffre and his clan or tribe, and their loyalties will stretch as far up as the King of Valenwood, but seldom higher. If the Bosmer find a reason to strongly dislike the Empire that presides over them they will reliably become less faithful and obedient, and even go as far as to push for independence.

Most commonly, the Imperial presence in Valenwood was little more than a collection of taxmen, and so the Bosmer were willing to support (or at least accept) any leader who promised to give them their independence and a sense of dignity. After the horrors of the Usurper’s reign, and his ultimate failure, this desire for a strong Valenwood appeared to fall through; most Bosmer ceased complaining about the Empire, but also ceased looking up to the Camoran dynasty, retreating to their clans and tribes and making the late Third Era one of the lowest points of Bosmeri nationalism.

However, the second Aldmeri Dominion, and it is, as ever, with those words that Imperial knowledge peters out. We have no way of gauging the degree of loyalty the Boiche hold for the Dominion, and when (or if) their new masters will outstay their welcome in Valenwood remains to be seen.


**Conclusion and Final Thoughts**

When I first set out to compile this treatise, history, and society of the Bosmer has driven me to great lengths, collecting and collating Imperial knowledge on Valenwood and its people, and presenting it in what I dearly hope will prove an insightful and accessible form.

With the current political situation being as it is, are truly impoverished by the closure of Valenwood’s borders, and the loss of free access to that kingdom’s rich bounties of culture and history.

I don’t have any decent pictures of one, their heads and neck resemble that of an eel, with the lower jaw jutting forward. What I find odd is the complete lack of horns and spikes, something that every other type of dragon has.
 

Most likely they’re a sub-species of Dovah, I have another idea.
 

I think that the Serpentine Dragons are the direct or indirect work of Hermaeus Mora. Durnehviir sought out the Ideal Masters in the Soul Cairn because he wanted the knowledge and power to become dominant. Dominance is what drives a dragon. Alduin went against his purpose because of it
 

Apocrypha
 

A few of them - probably numbering the single digits - entered Mora’s library in search of ways to become stronger, and all the fools lost in their lust for just another book. But as most know, Apocrypha is like an Eldritch TV Tropes, and even someone as great as Morian Zenas - who could keep their mind together through the nightmares of Quagmire and the horrors of Coldharbour - never returned from it.
 


I also remembered [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/14f6pg/my_theory_on_seekers_dragonborn_spoilers/) from a little while back, they changed, coming to resemble the world around them. The same might have happened to what would become the Serpentine Dragons, their forms shifting to become as sleek and slimy as the tentacles doting the ocean.
 

Of course, then it’s damn hard to tell now. If I had to guess, they either kept their form due to the strength of their souls, or because Mora wanted them that way. Both reasons (especially the latter) would also explain why Miraak isn’t affected by this. A Dragonborn isn’t just something that wanders in everyday. Dragons are rare visitors too, but not as rare as a Dragonborn, so he doesn’t mind them losing themselves as much.
 

As for why there’s one chilling out at Saering’s Watch, who wouldn’t want anyone else knowing what he knows. How he could get a Serpentine Dragon out of Apocrypha, I don’t know. Possibly the All-Maker Stones, since he can use them to manifest outside of Oblivion and nab dragon souls.

As for the character of Ulfric and a Stormcloak Skyrim. Many people have misgivings for the future of Skyrim under Ulfric's leadership. The only big change would be the militarisation of the masses. Skyrim would begin to prepare for the next Great War with the Dominion. Dialogue during the CW questline shows that Ulfric has sent out emissaries to High Rock already (and IIRC Hammerfell too) meaning that he wants to continue the bond between provinces that the Empire solidified.

It was a very simple place, and it was so aesthetically appealing, that I almost began to distrust it. 

Some of you may be wondering why they are called ""Peryite's Pits."" This is becuase, a pit in which the souls of his followers reside, a pit for each disease he has released or ever will release, and within that pit, all of the numerous things that can cause each specific disease. Then, at the center of the symmetric field, was the largest pit of all. Peryite's Pit. His Palace of Pestilence, his Domain of the Dragon. And it was here that I learned the most about Peryite himself.

He spoke with me, was very polite, calm, and submissive to my questions. He seemed borderline eager to answer me each and every time, which pleased me to no end. He told me about his part in the Ehlnofex Wars, as well. That was a story worth telling again.

""I've been around for a long time, just every once in a while. That's why I have my followers' and priests' souls venerated on their pit. But, as I was saying, I, like many other Daedra, are direct descendants of the God-King, Auri-El. I had nothing to do with the fighting between the King and the Rebel, I feel like I started it.

""You also might be wondering why I look like a dragon. I am from Auri-El, and thus forced that image upon me, as well. For how can time flow, or be measured, or be kept in tact without some sort of orderly maintenance?

This post comes with a small amount of pretext: Obviously the Elder Scrolls series is based on the player's ability to create whatever experience he/she wishes within the confines of the game. My question is just based on a little bit of speculation paired with some things that could be happenstance. 

Now
The heros of each of the main releases (Arena, Oblivion, and Skyrim), are all linked to the province of Cyrodiil. Daggerfall and Morrowinds' heroes are both sent to their respective destinations by the empire based on events occurring in said areas. Arena and Oblivions' heroes both have to escape from dungeons/prisons in the Imperial city. Finally, Skyrim's hero was caught up in an ambush while crossing the boarder from Cyrodiil to Skyrim. With all of that said, could it be presumed that each of these heroes is theoretically 'supposed' to be of the Imperial race? (I of course say 'supposed' with the utmost skepticism and a little sarcasm as well)

Now, I know. But if you really need proof, you're welcome to question)

The Nerevarine is pegged by everyone as an 'outlander'. This of course could make him any of the races, considering the laws (or lack-thereof) regarding slavery, a Khajiit or an Argonian player would have at least ONCE been targeted by Dunmer looking for slaves (if AI was a much more sophisticated of course, much speculation here). Nords would of course have to deal with millennia of bad blood dating back to the times soon after the Velothi migration, but their long-time rivalry rooted in war and bloodshed has long-since been dimmed by this time. Finally, Altmer also have a long-standing strained relationship with the Dunmer, but would it be so hard to think that an incarnation of a Chimer hero could be one of the Dunmer's closest relatives? Imperials (and the Empire) are a present-day threat (in the time of the TES:3), would be readily accepted by the Blades

The Champion of Cyrodiil is probably the hardest to pinpoint, your fellow prisoner, mentions to an Imperial PC, ""Oh, look, an Imperial in the Imperial Prison. I guess they don't play favorites, huh?"" Yes, but to me

The Dovahkiin of course has to do with the lineage of 'Dragonborn' figures in TES lore. Granted, Reman Cyrodiil (through Alessian Order), and the entire Septim line, from ol' Tiber himself (not an Imperial no matter how you slice it, but his lineage is), up-to-and-including Martin (obviously). While Nords seem to be the keepers of the legends of Dragonborn heroes and the Thu'um, Imperials seem to be the ones that have a history of *being* Dragonborn. 

So there you have it. My hastily-researched, and anything added (or subtracted) will be most appreciated.

1369496230.0,1f16to,The History of Card Games,OPGreenback,45,4,5,"*A pamphlet about the history and gameplay of Tamriel’s card games

Card games began in Morrowind with the ancient Dunmeri word ‘card’, Bonewalkers, Bonelords, and so on. The Dunmeri New Temple’s officially sanctioned explanation for the leap of language from ancestor guardians to slips of paper employed in gambling games has to do with the original use of the cards (here referring to the slips of paper) as tools of mysticism and divination. The tradition amongst such diviners is to rub the ashes of one’s own ancestors into the paper, enriching the paper with the knowledge of the benevolent dead.

However, the ancestor guardians themselves invented the game. The tale goes that a particular tomb robber (tomb theft being a terrible crime in Morrowind, but also one from which opportunistic adventurers and merchants were and are more than willing to profit) entered his most recently targeted tomb to discover that the ‘cards’, or ancestor guardians, were playing an odd game with slips of paper.

Presumably, learning the rules of the game, before charging out of the shadows and putting silver to the spirits, as tomb robbers do. He retrieved the deck and spread word of the marvelous ‘card’ game, or the game played by ‘cards.’ The game was a hit, swiftly spreading from the tomb robber’s personal circles to all of Morrowind. Over time, some amongst the common folk forgot that the ancient word ‘card’ referred to the guardians, but to the slips of paper themselves.

The Dunmeri card game developed a set standard, its inclusion of a group of ‘Power Trio’ cards (originally played out by the three Good Daedra, and then by the Tribunal, and now by the Good Daedra again), its three suits (most often accompanied with the same imagery as the ‘Power Trio’), its twelve minor cards (analogous to the Four Corners of the House of Troubles confronted by the three Good Daedra, to the Heavens that are the twelve worlds of creation, and so on. The use of guar-bone dice was introduced to the game later on

Card games were first introduced to the Empire, and stubbornly labored to ensure that the game became a popular upper class pastime. Modern historians believe that Katariah’s propagation of her native card game was yet another of her clever diplomatic tactics. By teaching her court to play the game, she not only established a shared interest between herself and the nobles at large, but she gained access to a coartload of gossip, as many wealthy and powerful figures cannot help but gossip as they gamble.

Katariah, the game took strongest root in Cyrodiil, the home of  Katariah’s court. Because the game first had to filter through the noble classes before reaching the common folk, the Imperial deck is arguably the most convoluted. For example, in the name of adding their own brand of religious imagery, the nobles separated the suits into entirely different themes; for example, the ‘Power Trio’ of each of the three suits is aligned to a particular set of three of the Nine Divines.

You'll notice some patterns here. Meht, Tayem/Hekem, Cess, and Payem are always the same. These six letters are always present, always in the same spot.

Now who is Rune? Nobody knows, he is Imperial. 

Next, he does it to make ends meet, he acts nice both to you and brynjolf for letting him join. He also gives Karliah the benefit of the doubt, etc etc.. He is a nice person, steals because he must, and perhaps those traits are hints from the writers?

On the latter subject, which in a note, mentions his sources are quite excellent. Now, keeping that fact in mind, I shall drag your attention to one particular line in this note found in the cistern: http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:No_Word_Yet ""*I still can't find a trace of your parents. Whoever they are, they've completely erased themselves from history*."" Now why use those specific words, doesnt it seem perhaps a bit familiar? Like, what happened to a certain Corvus Umbranox? Now lets bring back the fact he was found by a shipwreck

Now that that is said, perhaps they dropped off Rune themselves, for him to be found by others. I would lean towards this possibility because Nocturnal knows ive done enough diving in the shipwrecks everywhere to make sure (Pilgrims trench was an icy nightmare) that the cowl or any such corpses are there. Because why would Rune have been found alone safe and sound on the ground?

Now, showing off a cool new Gray Fox Cowl model. To this I raise the question, why make one so detailed, with the runes with a highly detailed look if it were only to tease us with it? Now I know the enchantment should be broken by Corvus, but this IS a daedric artifact, and a lot can happen in 200 years, whos to say no one restored the enchantment, why not the cowl? She seems to have a history of her artifacts being stolen and returned.

When the often unpopular subject of firearms are brought up, the continent of Akavir is assumed to be at war with itself during times of no interaction with Tamriel.

So, we have arrived. The Aurbis stood strong, offspring of order and chaos alike flourished. Many such beings, the et' Ada, came to be. However, this place was still shapeless and without character. As more lesser gods faced realization of their own presence, so did they realize their own dislike of such emptiness. And as with all blank slates

The greatest of these authors soon realized his talent for not only seeing what is not there and what could come to be; but his talent for convincing his peers. Some say convincing, Lorkhan; the creator, the trickster, the tester; saw what this beginning place could become. With a silver tongue and a boisterous spirit he went to the other et'Ada with his plan.

Magnus, the Magne Ge, Magnus set to work laying a schematic; stone, sod; bone, blood; wisdom and will would all be his mortar. While the blueprint for Lorkhan's house was written, he approached others for investment.

Whether the implications of such a contribution was known to the et'Ada who agreed, is those who laughed at the face of a new world unbound did not forget Lorkhan's ingenuity. 

Many et'Ada went to craft their own lands, unpredictable and beyond control. The serpent has only one head, reigned by focus but chained by regal opinion. These kingdoms would persist, but rarely prosper.

Should a wanderer such as yourself wish to see these realms with your own eyes, Peryite's land of lava and pestilence; it is advisable to receive proper vaccinations. The silver towers of Moonshadow, blessed by Azura's dawn and dusk; be cautious of what may appear stunning or silent, this land of beauty hides many secrets. To run among the Hunting Grounds and all it's organic splendor, but be wary of Hircine's manbeast; adorned with tattoos of pursuits dictation, he is voracious. 

With the turning of the heavens, cursing him to madness and schizophrenic duplicity. To march against his own heart; both black and white, without rhyme or reason.

With the map drawn and the compass set; creation stood for those who would follow Lorkhan's pilgrimage of concept. Surrounded by the cycle of other landscapes held firm by their creators, with all hasty decisions and uninformed investments, returns are not guaranteed.

**Be forewarned! What follows is a lightly edited rant about my dissatisfaction with the state of music in Tamriel

Tamrielic music, which sadly only teaches spoken word a offers basic training in 3 instruments. They offer nothing in the way of reading music (I'm highly doubtful that they have any form of notation in Tamriel), music theory (generally requires notation, but certain studies can be done without), or the creation of new songs (those are made, rather poorly, by individual bards, die with them).

This is all I know. Perhaps there is some fabled Aldmeri orchestra out in the Summerset isles

Now

*(Also note that the majority of my information is coming from a music history class I've been taking for 3 years, and the Bard songs from Skyrim.)*

________________________________________________________________________________________________

* **Instruments**

*Strings*.We see lutes in both Morrowind and Skyrim, this is somewhat unusual considering the other Advancements of Tamrielic culture (architectural, economic, agricultural, social), however I'm willing to compare it to ancient Egypt, who took 500 years to go forms Harps to Lyres. So I'll leave strings be (but I don't want to

*Percussion*! We see drums in both Morrowind and Skyrim as well, we see 2 (arguably 3) kinds of drums; The Guarskin Drum, Drum, and... Drum. Was nobody on Tamriel thinking of making different things to hit? Even bigger or smaller variations on drums. Was there a collective ""Wow, this is nice. Now let's never do anything like it ever again.""? So there's my bullying on percussion.

*Woodwinds*. We see ""flutes"" in Skyrim. However I consider them to me more of a recorder, and how they sound. That's all we have there.

*Brass*. Nonexistent.

That concludes our four major instrumental food groups. So,451 years of civilization, we see practically no change in music whatsoever, however here on Earth in about 400 years less than that we see the invention of: 14 unique musical instruments, the birth of written notation, the birth of music theory, and the first orchestra. 

Now I know that Tamriel isn't Earth, we've known of song and music in Tamriel since Ysgramor and his 500 (a good deal of songs were written about him). In fact, for a good while, the majority of Tamriel's histories were told through song, so what stopped the development of new music and/or musical advancement?

* **Music Theory**

Now, we see no inversions of any kind, so the chords used are simple, arpeggiated root chords. Again, you'd of think if they can figure out that E-minor resolves to G, that they'd figure out a (painfully simple) inversion like **I**-*6/4* chord.

We don't hear key changes in Tamrielic music

*""I'm going to gut you like a Horker!""*

Quite the popular threat in Skyrim. While sounding simple

* The Economics of Skyrim:
Horkers have very easily been an influence on the Economy of Skyrim since it's original settlement. The main reason would be the selling and altering of Horker tusks for the Ivory. The use of Horker tusks in Skyrim is so large, in fact, contains no fewer than **One and a half** full Horker tusks worth of Horker Ivory. I should also briefly mention that Horker hides, while immensely heavy and difficult to transport, makes some of the strongest leather available, with a natural resistance to the cold!

* The Agriculture of Skyrim:
*""the meat and tusks will fetch a nice bit of gold at market."" -Heidmir Starkad, being both rich in protein and fat, easy and quick to cook, and resistant to cold temperatures, it's a near staple in every good citizen [of Skyrim]'s diet. Being the large animals they are, (ranging from 7 to a whopping 18 feet long at adulthood) a single Horker can feed a family for a month, and if preserved correctly, during my younger years

* The Ecology of Skyrim:
Horkers, mentioned above) don't need to be hunted highly regularly, and nor should they be. The most common time to hunt is late during Last Seed, when the pups are now old enough to fend for themselves and the adults are fattened up in preparation for the Winter. A good hunter knows to leave the pups alone, so that next years hunt is just as good, however some poachers will kill them all the same, which can create problems in breeding. Strict enforcement on anti-poaching laws enforced by northern Jarls has helped cut back on this needless slaughter of not yet matured pups and keeps the balance in order.

From my earliest experiences with the *Elder Scrolls* series

Every other sign represents a fantasy archetype, the ""Apprentice"", or the ""Shadow"", the ""Serpent"", the ""Steed"". Among these, the Ritual and Tower are oddities. While the powers typically bestowed by these signs are associated with the qualities the sign calls to mind (Paralysis in the snake, Invisibility with the shadow, both these signs bestow abilities only tangentially related to their name.

In Skyrim, and restored the players health, and in Morrowind it had the same effect. If we consider the Morrowind interpretation, the sign seems to suggest some sort of holy ritual, restoring health and repelling the undead. By contrast, the Skyrim interpretation is somewhat darker, seeming to indicate a dark ritual associated with necromancy and the raising of the dead.

Now, and larger one than that behind Morrowind. More to the point, I believe that choices were made in the later game to better reflect the given titles of the birthstones - While the link between ""Ritual"" and ""Repel the dead"" is a little tenuous, the link between ""Ritual"" and ""Raise the dead"" is easier to appreciate. So, too, with the Tower.

In Morrowind, removing the detection aspects and focusing it on the idea of a tower as a site of defense and strength, providing defensive enchantments and retaining the ability to unlock locks, for breaking into said sites of strength. Skyrim cuts down on the powers even further, stripping away everything except unlocking locks. The purpose has changed from Morrowind, with its peculiar set of enchantments for finding and unlocking to just breaking into towers.

But I wonder. Was something missed? Something implied by the sign as it was originally

It was an entry in *The Book of the Dragonborn* in Skyrim which caught my interest. It describes the events which will proceed the coming of the Dragonborn

*When the Brass Tower walks and Time is reshaped*

The Brass Tower - Numidium. That great and terrible entity that lies behind nearly every great mystery in the history of Tamriel, powerful enough to destroy the Aldmeri Dominion in a single day and burn the entire dwarven race from the world. A machine that, at full power, created gods.

You can probably already see where I am going with this. In Morrowind, and the season of the Tower is known as Frostfall. 

Allow me, picking locks and detecting life, have everything to do with thievery and little to do with the physical object of a tower. It makes little sense for its season to be that of Frostfall (And this association is one which is seen in other constellations, for instance in the Thief residing over the season of Evening Star and the Lover of Sun's Dawn). Further, in no game has the ability to detect gold or wealth been associated with the Tower, even though it defines it in multiple games.

I believe that the answer to this misalignment may lie with Numidium, housing them in their giant underground cities below Skyrim as slaves. Long after the fall of the elves on the surface to the Nords, the Dwemer ruled below Skyrim, until their eventual destruction by the activation of Numidium. In a sense, the Dwemer destroyed and replaced the snow elves, and then they themselves fell. Two Frostfalls, of the snow elves and of the elves that replaced them in Skyrim.

It's a tenuous link, the coming of a darker time of shorter and colder days. The Brass Tower brings the Frostfall, and the Dwemer are destroyed. 

As I said, from Talos wrenching the empire away from the Dominion to the Warp in the West, where five separate parties all tried to use the Numidium to seize control of the Iliac Bay and all, in a sense, succeeded. Even the actions of the Tribunal were, in a sense, theft of the power of the Nuidium's heart, not gold or silver

As a final piece of speculation, while referring to the subterranian lives of the Dwemer, also has connotations with wealth and possesion of gold. The Dwemer were certainly wealthy, and had large sums of both gold and their golden ""Dwarven"" metal from which golden plates, armours, and structures were built. The blessing of the Tower, long said to be that of having a nack for finding gold, creators of the Numidium

So, certainly. But also a theory. I believe that the power of the Numidium was so great, so immense, that it was written into the stars after its first activation. The Tower, this peculiar building in the sky among concepts and creatures, is in reality a representation of the Numidium. 

I believe that at some point, the Heart of Lorkhan, which resulted in the disappearance of the Dwemer, the Numidium made its mark on the sky. The Numidium forever marked its destruction of the Dwemer in the memory of the world, as a epitaph l to a race that sought the powers of gods. And as a warning to those who might seek to follow them, of the Frostfall that might come to them in turn.

1359939866.0,17u5xk,The social and political unevenness of Tamrielic society,CatsCatsEverywhere,42,4,15,"Hello folks. Just wanted to put a starter post out there on a thought I just had. When we see people in Tamriel we usually assume they live in something similar to real life feudal systems from the Middle Ages. They work farms or are apprentices. However this does not quite add up. An important detail to note is that the pubs or bars or whatever you would like to call them fill up at about 6 o clock everyday and all the stores close usually not much later than 5 or 6 at night. Now this would surely only come about with some rather liberal ideas towards workers rights and all that good stuff. And yet we still see the same type of jobs that typify feudal systems.

Now the reason this strikes me as odd is the political styles of the continent. They are usually monarchies or something to that effect with no sign of citizen involvement (aside from the very well off) or voting or anything that defines a regular liberal democracy. Mostly they can be described as fairly weak nationalistic autocracies

A large part of this

However the difference is less plausible when one considers the Imperials and the Nords. Sure, anthropologist, philosopher you name it would have a tough time describing a realistic scenario in which these socioeconomic features so grossly mis-align. If this was not just a way to make it easier on the game designers then I would like to try and find the feature of society that can account for this and possibly shed light on a coming social revolution in Tamriel. I will try to research this but until I get the chance to I would love some input, thoughts and even leads if you have some. Thanks for the read.",,False,,False,t3_17u5xk
1359485368.0,17icta,The Eight Stories of Y’ffre and the Eight Promises of the Bosmer,lebiro,40,4,13,"**The Eight Stories of Y’ffre and the Eight Promises of the Bosmer**

*It is perhaps incorrect to call this tale a “creation myth” as it clearly begins some time after creation. Nonetheless

*Like all the great tales of the Bosmer, or elaborate performance with masks and costumes (where Azurah is invariably taught Payment in Kind by the generous audience), perhaps accounting for the seemingly stilted language. Regrettably, all semblance of rhyme and rhythm are lost in translation.* 

The mortals were young and Mundus was strange, and it made him sad, that the Natural Order was not yet settled. So Y’ffre Sang one of his Songs, and every mortal heard it, and every mortal knew its shape. Mer became mer, men became men, beasts became beasts, for each was unique and beautiful. But of them all he had one special favourite. To him, and he watched them always.

But Azurah saw Y’ffre’s happiness and she was jealous, and was jealous. So she took as many as she could hold, and she whispered more secrets and changed them. Azurah’s forest folk forgot their true forms that Y’ffre taught them, and Azurah taught them knew ones, more than they needed so none could tell which was right, and she told them they were Khajiit.

Y’ffre saw his favourite people change and he wept, for the forest folk were her favourites also, and Y’ffre’s Natural Order was a beautiful thing. And Nirn was sad, but Nirn was angry, and she changed the lands of Azurah’s forest folk. She made their deserts hot and dry, and she made their forests dark and filled with poison. And when she was done she thanked Y’ffre, and because she loved the forest and the forest folk, and Nirn told Y’ffre to make a new one. So Y’ffre returned to his favourite people

And while Y’ffre thought, they would never know Payment in Kind, and would always be weak and greedy. Z’en was a clever god and Y’ffre believed him, and he thought of ways the forest folk could learn Payment in Kind. When he found his forest folk he had remembered all the things he knew, and all the things he could teach them.

Y’ffre knew much about names, and not beasts. And they learned the names of all the beasts, and how they could remind them of Y’ffre. 

And Y’ffre knew much about shapes, so they could always see and hear secrets like Azurah’s.

And Y’ffre knew much about the forest, even the graht oaks that were his favourite trees.

And Y’ffre knew all about bows, and they made them for themselves.

And Y’ffre knew all about the Natural Order

And Y’ffre knew all about singing

And Y’ffre knew all about Singing, because too much Song would spoil his Natural Order. But Singing was harder than singing, and the Bosmer could only Roar until their voices were strong like Y’ffre’s.

And Y’ffre thought he had Sang all his stories, and to kill the peaceful, and to cut and burn and eat the forest. And he looked at the Bosmer and saw how they were small, and smiling and peaceful, and he knew they might never be safe, and he wept. But Y’ffre remembered there was one other thing he knew all about.
Y’ffre knew all about the chaos before the Natural Order because he had seen it all before he Sang the shapes and ended it.  And he looked at the Bosmer and he knew he had to Sing again. So he Sang his eighth story, and they learned the chaos could save the sacred forest. 

And now Y’ffre had finished his stories, because Z’en could not Sing like Y’ffre could, and so he could not teach all like Y’ffre could. So Y’ffre had to teach the Bosmer Payment in Kind without Singing.

So he told the Bosmer there were gifts he wanted in return for his stories

“First, “you must love the Natural Order as I have. You must always preserve it and never break it as Azurah did, for it is my greatest work and the smooth bones of creation.” And this was the First Decree.

“Second, “you must never harm or abuse the plants I love, and you must never kill my trees.” And this was the Cutting Injunction.

“But, “I give you a special tree, whose fruit will bear you as wooden boats do,” and he Sang to the trees on the riverbank and they became Rellyeis. And this was the Maritime Provision. 

“And, “I give you one special tree that is my favourite, to be your home forever,” and he Sang to the mightiest graht-oak and it came to him. And this was the Falinesti Permission.

“Third, “you must never eat my plants. You must eat only meat, for you are hunters, and your kin must eat in three days whatever you kill, for that is the Natural Order.” And this was the Meat Mandate.

“Fourth, “you must defend my sacred forest from those who would harm it, for it brings me great joy and gives you all you have. And you must use my eighth story only to this end, for I weep to see my Natural Order broken for nothing.” And this was the Guardianship Clause.

“Fifth, “you must welcome peaceful visitors with open arms, for though you are my favourites, I love all who love the forest.” And this was the Oath of Acceptance.

“Sixth, “you must make war only in defence of your lives, your kin and my sacred forest, for I weep to see my favourite people bloody themselves with war, and such death is not the Natural Order.” And this was the Promise of Peace.

“Seventh, “You must avoid secrets and deceit, and punish those who practice them against you, for they are the ways of Azurah and have broken my Natural Order once already.” And this was the Stricture for Truth.

“Eighth, “You must remember me always, even when I do not walk among you, for I love you and you alone can keep my commands and care for my forest.” And this was Y’ffre’s Ordinance.

And now he had given the Bosmer eight commands, and they took it. And this was the Green Pact.

And when all this was done, and he Sang out loud Azurah’s secret, so that she might weep as he had wept. But she did not, and she never learned Payment in Kind.",,False,,False,t3_17icta

1348756652.0,10kbv4,Falmer History and Culture,regalnerd,39,3,28,"I would like to talk about a race that we have all encountered in Skyrim

So we really don't know that much about the Falmer

According to Gelebor the Falmer pantheon consisted of Auri-El, Phynaster, and Syrabane, however this seems rather small for a pantheon, especially when compared to every other culture on Tamriel besides the Dwemer. The two races that the Falmer were closest to were the Ayleid, whom they shared their language with, and the Dwemer, as independent city states, coupled with the ancestor worship that is standard for all elven religions.

What do we know about the Falmer religion? For starters they are extremely focused on Aetherius and light, who apparently communes with Auri-El, Vyrthur's exact words were “I had the ears of a god.”. Third is that the Chantry seemed to hold a significance to even Auri-El himself, as it appears to serve as a sort of default location of his bow and possibly his shield, given the Gelebor knows for a fact that the bow is in the Chantry.

I propose that there are twice as many Falmer ruins in Skyrim than are commonly believed. Notice how  the Architecture of the College of Winterhold doesn't line up with either the ancient Nordic ruins or the ruins of the second or third empire that still dot the land. The College of Winterhold has statues of Magnus situated in the main courtyard, the Nords were expanding into sacred territory. I do not believe that it was over the Eye of Magnus, because whatever the Eye may be it popped up in Saarthal sometime after Jyrik Gaulderson was sealed there.

1329614077.0,pvwe2,The Altmer: A Cultural Perspective.,nerdlights,41,6,25,"I decided I'd take a crack at submitting something useful

So to begin this

The Altmeri come from a group of Aldmer which stayed on the Summerset Isles while others traveled to Valenwood and the rest of mainland Tamriel. They are the closest relation to the Altmer

The Altmer, they place heavy emphasis on the more artistic pursuits. Art, Writing, Law etc. The common tongue of Tamriel is actually based off of Altmeri language. In fact, many cultural advances in Tamriel have been a result of their ideas. To put it simply, what the Dwemer were to technology, they are to artistic culture. Because of this, but they believe they're not as cultured as they are. Which isn't false in this case. So Art is pretty much their defining cultural aspect.

NOTE: I think it's important to clarify that while the Altmer can be snobbish

The Altmer are naturally gifted at Magic

During the 1st and 2nd Era the Altmer were absent from most events that occurred on the mainland. The sea that surrounds Summerset both saved the Altmer from and introduced them to problems. Like most other nations in the 1st and 2nd Era
&gt;Internal conflicts between Skywatch and Firsthold

But much more pressing, the Altmer teamed up with the Bosmer of Valenwood, and the Aldmeri Dominion was formed. I think it's interesting to note that the original Dominion was one of necessity for the Altmer. This formation was short-lived, however, as Tiber Septim with the Numidium wiped the Dominion out in c.2E 896. The end of the Oblivion Crisis saw the reformation of a much more powerful Aldmeri Dominion in 4E 29, and after the Void Nights of 4E 98-100, the Aldmeri Dominion control Summerset

Now what is not known to some is that the Thalmor, and more specifically the Thalmor view Lorkhan as bad, he made them mortal. They resent man for their belief that Lorkhan gave man the gift of life from nothing. Some wounds never heal, as they say, and the Thalmor seem to have some belief that by eliminating man, they can some how return to this divinity. You'll notice that while they're racial snobs, they don't hold issue with the beast races. In short

The Altmer, and contribute much to Tamriellic tradition. If you have any questions are feel I skimmed anything let me know, I'm really trying to tie all this info to any questions anyone may have.

I know that as the Imperial City was being surrounded by the Dominion

It's the part about him breaking out to the north, not North. In order for Titus to have fled, he would have had to run right by the Aldmeri army to the west of the city. Assuming that the armies had not entered the city yet, considering this was a surprise movement by Titus and would have happened in a very quick timespan, the Aldmeri army literally must have let an entire army cross a bridge that was on their flank. Not only could they have easily crished the Imperials in a straight fight, given their size, they could have obliterated them as they were forced through a narrow chokepoint. 


Maybe I'm looking into this too much. Maybe I have been playing too much Total War recently that I noticed this


EDIT: The main source we have on this 


   * In 4E 174, Aldmeri reinforcements gathered in southern Cyrodiil, and on 12th of Second Seed, they launched a massive assault on the Imperial City itself. One army drove north to completely surround the city, while Lord Naarifin's main force attacked the walls from the south, east, and west. The Emperor's decision to fight his way out of the city rather than make a last stand was a bold one. No general dared advise him to abandon the capital

    While the Eighth Legion fought a desperate (and doomed) rearguard action on the walls of the city, however, the capital fell to the invaders and the infamous Sack of the Imperial City began. The Imperial Palace was burned, the White-Gold Tower itself looted, and all manner of atrocities carried out by the vengeful elves on the innocent populace.

EDIT 2: Putting this up here because taxusbaccata posted it late, they probably would have sent only a small detachment to guard it, since they never expected a retreat from the city anyway. The legions would have smashed through whatever was waiting for them, leaving the VIII Legion on the walls of the Imperial City, and then marched to Bruma. Even though a Dunkirk type thing happening seems really cool, it seems pretty unlikely. Thanks for the insight everyone!",,,Winterhold,

We will begin with my personal favorite; the Tsaesci.

Tsaesci is probably the country that is most easily comparable to Tamrielic life.  There are merchants, and overseers.  The first three are obvious, the last one, overseers, is a profession that oversees the goblin laborers in the fields or mines.  The primary occupations in the southern parts of the country are mainly merchants and light craftsman (those who make light objects, out of wood, paper, either on the coast, with more mountains and many more mines.  Heavy craftsman thrive in this area, and once you reach the bottom

Kamal has a very interesting culture as well.  This country is much more based on war, but they do have a warrior-king.  Housing is unknown, as they do not need housing to survive the long, harsh winters of the area.  Instead, they freeze in winter, and thaw out in the summer.  It could be that buildings serve a utility purpose, such as to act as a place of congregation, as they have weapons and armors.  Then

Tang Mo is perhaps the best place for any tourists to the continent to head. The monkey residence here are very laid back, sometimes more.  The tribes don't often interact politically, and there hasn't been harsh blood between them.  It's hard to call this place a country really, but they do have some form of central government.  Each year, the beginning of summer is marked by a large festival, followed by each tribe offering up warriors to defend the country from the Kamal invaders.  The country has very able warriors, and they have defended against the Tsaesci, and Ka Po'Tun in the past, and it prevents the Kamal from reaching them.  Nothing is known on the art of the area.

Ka Po'Tun, but are allied with the Tang Mo (especially helpful during the Kamal attacks on Tang Mo).  Their culture revolves around war, and dragons.  The main goal of most every member of this country is to turn into a dragon.  That is literal.  Their goal is to go from being a Tiger, to being a ferocious, reptilian, winged, killing machine.  There is no known information on how that process works, primarily using brick and wood.  The race is very aggressive and it is not known if they have art outside of architecture.  As said earlier; they harbor deep resentment against the Tsaesci, possibly because Tamriel was the cause of death of many dragons as well.  Warriors are revered here, though they are said to be the largest dragon in all of Nirn.  This being written before the recent dragon-crisis

As Dyus is the chamberlain of Jyggalag and the keeper of the library that once held all information in existence. It makes sense that he would know of the Godhead and CHIM

Thus I believe that what he is saying here is that because he is aware that he is simply the derivative of a dream, nor does he care for time, as that doesn't truly exist either.

First off, like how the Orsimer can trace themselves back to the Aldmer who worshipped Trinimac/served in the army.

We all know about the Aldmer

These mer were nature lovers. They loved trees, birds, bugs, just everything about nature. When they left from Aldmeris they settled in the southern forests where they always reveled in the beauty of Tamriel's flora and fauna.

The Mer had spent such a long time in the forests with the animals they were often confused as to whether they were mer or beast. If they got along so well with nature like the beasts, they saw the men from the north turning into beast and plant and man again.

These mer were called the Moramer. Mora meaning forests/woods.

They could acknowledge the gift Y'ffre gave men and mer though

Azurah called out to Nirni from beyond Jone and Jode, taking some of the Moramer and placing them into the best forests and deserts on all of Nirni. From there she made Khajiit and bound them to the lunar lattice.

But Y'ffre overheard the first secret and snuck behind Azurah

Nirni would make life as hard as possible for the new form, but Y'ffre negotiated with Nirni so that some of the forests could still be beautiful and harmonious. From then Y'ffre left and Azurah was despised by Nirni. Y'ffre then went to the Moramer of the remaining forests and changed their form and made sure they knew they were mer and not beast, unless the gift of Nirni's deal were to in danger. Y'ffre didn't have the knowledge Azurah had, however, and thus could not make the new mer keep their shape if they had to change into beast. Y'ffre called them Bosmer and from that point, Khajiit and Bosmer were no longer considered related. The Bosmer and Khajiit had their own beliefs now, the Bosmer possessing a mixed pantheon of Men and Mer gods

Y'ffre was not done, Y'ffre didn't have a foolproof plan, but Azurah swiftly acted where she was needed and blocked the ears of Lorkhaj and Ahnurr to ensure they would never hear the first secret. This was the first of times the children of Anu and Padomay could walk upon Nirni freely, this would not last forever though. The Dragon would interrupt that, but that's a story for another time.

EDIT: I'd also like to thank lebiro for helping me out with the Bosmer stuff I was previously unaware of

EDIT: changed ""Betmer"" to ""Moramer"" after discovering the term ""Betmer"" is already in use for a different reason and Moramer works better after reconsidering it (for the 4th time)",,t5_2t5ay,1359130859.0,,Moth,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1791f2/the_nature_loving_mer_of_tamriels_south/

I couldn't find any posts about Miraak in /r/teslore so far, fill in the gaps of my knowledge. I'm a PC player, so I haven't had a chance to play yet, but it seems like UESP has not updated with much background information on Miraak yet. Unlike the Volkihar, who were mentioned in *Immoral Blood* in *Oblivion,* Miraak does not (so far as I can tell) have any connection to the lore. Maybe someone more familiar with Herma Mora would know if Miraak could be alluded to in earlier books. 

It seems kind of like a no-brainer

I ask primarily because of the [similarities between the Miraak mask and [Conjecture](/g ""the Falmer helm"")](http://i.imgur.com/AAioc.png). They seem too similar to be mere coincidence on the part of the devs.

You may ask: Well

**Extremely Mild *Dragonborn* Spoiler**: When Miraak is defeated, it would make more sense (gameplay-wise) for you to only see him as a skeleton once you remove his clothing. Of course, the Dragonborn absorbs his soul, so it's possible that he looks different before the absorption and only becomes a skeleton because that's what dragons do when a Dragonborn absorbs their soul, but I haven't played yet. I have only watched the ending on YouTube.

My understanding is that during the reign of King Harald, [Morrowind Spoiler](/s ""the remains of the Snow Prince are found during *Bloodmoon*."")

So I got to digging, ""The Prophet Arden-Sul,"" which stated that the Sacellum itself predates Arden-Sul. It is here that Arden-Sul had some kind of epiphany [the Manics and the Demented differ on the method by which this epiphany was gained], and it is here that Arden-Sul would eventually die. The Manics decree that he died due to a greenmote overdose, while the Demented whisper tales of Arden-Sul ripping out his own heart after slaying his court.

The only remaining lore on Arden-Sul in-game is that given by the Heretics and the Zealots, and seek to dethrone and kill Sheogorath. 

In direct opposition to the Heretics, ""Zealotry,"" that Arden-Sul was the mortal aspect of Sheogorath, who would eventually return to ""cleanse the realm."" What they mean by ""cleanse"" is unclear. However, what is interesting here is that Sheogorath had a mortal aspect prior to the CoC mantling the Prince of Madness. This brings up the following question: did Arden-Sul mantle and become Sheogorath prior to the CoC, and if so, is the CoC doomed to simply continue the cycle of the Greymarch

After reading Lady Nerevar's much more organized monkeytruth, further possible proof of Lady Nerevar's theory was given when Sheogorath [confirmed to be our CoC] spoke the following line about his title.

""I'm a mad god. The Mad God, every few thousand years.""

Now, the CoC's struggle in the Shivering Isles was simply an incredibly long con by Sheogorath. However, there is no mention of Jyggalag in Skyrim save for a footnote in the book ""On Oblivion,"" which lists him amongst several other ""lesser-known"" Daedric Princes.

[Pictured here](http://i.imgur.com/xaP1W.jpg), you have the typical Falmer and Falmer Gloomlurker. They're primarily sword and shield or bow/war axe fighters, and use poison. Note the defined shoulder, and the size of the biceps in relation to the deltoids. This could be a side effect of swinging and lugging around heavy armor all day though, so let's focus on the face and head. There's no hair to speak of, and the jawline is sharp and angular, but not very thin. Now, but it is a bit suggestive of my ultimate point behind this post. Next, which, Falmer and Falmer Gloomlurkers have bare

Next, [here](http://i.imgur.com/X7Ntz.jpg), and [here](http://i.imgur.com/HoOsE.jpg). The first things that should stick out is the headdress. It's intricate, and appears to be bound and wrapped *on* something, rather than a part of this particular Betrayed's head. The next thing that you should note is the armor. Interestingly enough, that Shadowmaster was wearing no armor. Yet it's shown with a piece of intricate armor that coves up the majority of the trunk and chest, as well as a much more substantial covering for the crotch, biceps, though still quite defined. The jawline of the Shadowmaster is similarly angled like the other Falmer, I believe

That has some very interesting implications, could they now be dedicated to Shadow, and to the eradication of Light? Does this mean that the Betrayed are advanced enough to not only remember their old traditions, but actively change them? Are these gender roles completely solid, or are there some who take the other's place? Did the Snow Elves have a society of priestesses and warriors? The Staves that Shadowmasters carry are in a very specific style, very similar to the style of Falmer weapons. Does that mean that the Betrayed retained their arcane skills right on down to being able to create powerful enchanted items? It seems fairly obvious, what with the prevalence of poisons among the Betrayed, so why wouldn't they be able to enchant items?

Also, Nchuand-Zel Quarters, has a torture chamber, complete with a rack, poisons, cages, and a slab of stone beneath three flame jets operated by a lever. Do the Betrayed use instruments of torture? If so, or are they actively seeking information from their victims? Or perhaps, equating them with simpler beings and creatures of near-human/meri intelligence? Are they conscious, poets

by Castus Domini
4E 180

Among the more obscure circles of scholars much is taught about Dragon Breaks. Yet it is my firm belief that most scholar's understanding of the topic is

To begin with, which don't fulfill their purpose anymore. A broken sword is not used in war, because even if someone put all the pieces together, they would not become the sword by mere virtue of being close to each other. What any sensible person would do is get another sword, or perhaps  melt down these pieces to forge a new one from the same material.

The other part of our problem is the Dragon. What is the Dragon? I am afraid this is not as easy to define as the word “broken”, whatever It is, is very closely related to time. In fact, we could say the Dragon is time. But this brings about a new question. What is time? This is where the real problem lies. One might be tempted to say that time is the sequence of events which conform a “timeline”, and while this answer is satisfactory for most, it falls short when  considering Dragon Breaks. If time was a linear succession, Dragon Breaks would be exactly the opposite. That is, and therefore no Dragon. But after (if such a thing is possible) Dragon Breaks, the Dragon, but not at the same instant. Some things Were

But if during a Dragon Break an infinite number of possiblities Are, only one of these possiblities Is. We only experience a fragment of reality. The Dragon, in fact, is broken as I write this. A Dragon Break is nothing but the Dragon being whole again. Our timeline is plagued with Are Nots, because linear time is by its very definition broken, as if one tried to represent the forest by piling up many different pictures of it, one with many leaves

Notes on Racial Phylogeny says it is an open question, they seem to think it is more likely that they **can** interbreed:

&gt;It is less clear whether the Argonians and Khajiit are interfertile with both humans and elves. Though there have been many reports throughout the Eras of children from these unions

There have been ""many reports"" of children coming from mating with Argonians. However, but this can't be empirically confirmed by the author.

I also went through old developer posts to see if they had commented on it:

&gt;No comment on the exact relationship between the Hist and the Argonian reproductive cycle, there are a number that have live births (basically, the eggs hatch internally). I guess I had pictured the Argonians going more the live birth route, because they are so humanoid, but the concept of them laying eggs is an interesting one. Have to think more on that.

Initially

Pete Hines agreed with him:

&gt;Argonians are ovoviviparous. [Wow. I was SURE I'd never have to use that word again.] They don't lay eggs like reptiles.
Note that Lady Argonians have big bumps on their chests.

*But

&gt;Men and Mer assume much about Argonians, as necessity demands. All live at the whim of the Great Root.

&gt;Never underestimate the adaptability of Argonians, the power of the Hist to allow Argonians to adapt.

&gt;I wouldn't expect to hear an Argonian born in Skyrim (or on Solstheim, nomadic tribe) speak about laying eggs. However, in warmer climates, in places with established, stable, and permanent communities, you would likely see a great number of eggs.

So it might be that whether Argonians can have offspring with humans is dependent on whether they are the egg-laying sort or the live birth sort. This would likely be dependent on things like the distance from Black Marsh and the amount of Hist sap consumed.

The best part of owning the finest bookstore in the Imperial City has always to me been the types of people it produces for you. Countless scholars and adventurers seeking as well as carrying knowledge of obscure aspects of history find their way through my doors

My most interesting recent acquisition found its way to the Imperial City in the hands of a traveler who some of my contacts informed me had ties with the Summerset Shadows. He offered me a scroll he claimed to have salvaged while exploring the ruins of Crystal Tower. A single glance at its elegantly intricate construction was all that was needed to verify its authenticity. The translation from Aldmeri was fairly straightforward, but it can be inferred from the scroll's content to have been authored sometime around the exile of the Chimer from their homeland in the Middle Merethic Era. It reads as follows:

*Heresy has existed among us since the time of the First Dividing. It bares its fangs at the legacy of our ancestors and calls itself a welcoming smile. The heretic Veloth is far from the first to cast his lot into the Void raving delusions of freedom. All is not as it once was

*Know that the Path to Heaven is built Eight lanes wide

*Know that the Pits of Death lie twice greater in number and the Path is watched from all sides by those who may not walk it. They call out to the chosen pilgrims with songs of liberty, and cloaked in hope.*

*See that the Path leads upwards and the Pits lie beneath, opened by Auri-El the Eternal King. To fall from it is to fall without recourse and be devoured by darkness once only and forevermore. The twice-eight hunger for the souls of the Chosen to feed their false-heavens and extinguish the light that reveals their impurity for those with eyes of truth to look away from.*

*What they promise is Freedom.*

*What they offer is Doom.*

*Know that the Path begins and ends at the great city of our Lord Anui-El, yet never are we lost. Eight stars light the way to Salvation, and show us how to mend the wounds cut by the Void Knife in the flesh of the One.*

*To walk the Path is to reassemble the body of the One with the souls of the faithful.*

*To walk the Path is to escape the prison and reclaim the stars.*

*Know that the Deceiver is the False Ninth Star who changed thirds to twenty-fifths and tunnels as a Serpent through the core of the Path. Though vanquished by the Eternal King

*Doom is the force that changes the song to the verse to the word to the letter and ends in death.*

*That which rises from Doom is chaos

*Know that light is fire in its highest form

*To follow heresy is to be cut from the body of the One by the Void Knife and devoured by its sixteen wielders.*

*To be cut from the body of the One is to be subtracted from Infinity.*

*Infinity can be made no less by means of subtraction

*The light of the stars belongs to the Chosen. The Path home lies open so long as the Eight lanes remain joined. We maintain Aurbis in three partitions and banish the Serpent that turns Eight to nine and One to three. When the Path reaches its end,False,,t5_2t5ay,1360537953.0,,Psijic,t3_189sch

**18: The Egg

And now we are at possibly the most contentious of the numbers.  The problem is that this Sermon appears to directly deal with Vivec,"" it's easy to assume that 18 is Vivec's number and nothing more.

However, actually, because Vivec is far more than Vivec.  It's easy to prove.  I can do it with a pocket calculator.

In numerology

**9 * 2 = 18**

Mortality multiplied by Divinity.  This is actually an excellent description of Vivec.  But it could also describe the Amaranth

From another angle, which is the Six Walking Ways times The Invisible Gate, ALMSIVI.  This is a reference to both reaching Heaven by Violence and the Secret Gate at the center of the heart of the Second Serpent, as described in [Sermon 21](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/thirty-six-lessons-vivec-sermon-twenty-one).

Either way

**9 + 2 = 11**

A mortal added to divinity.  A Master, and it's not hard to guess that anyone who has walked any of the Six Walking Ways could be considered a Master.  If nothing else, there are a minimum of three Masters in the Lessons (Nerevar, Vivec, and the Void Ghost) and possibly more (Ysmir, Sheogorath, Dagoth Ur

A Master will be the next Ruling King

**9 - 2 = 7**

Mortality minus Divinity?  Doesn't make much sense that way,"" a void, it starts to work.  Removing a void from the Enantiomorph requires a Sword at its Center.

**2 and 9 = 29**

And here we are, next to a Void (9).  The Captive Sage is Mortality and Divinity at once, a flawed perfection, destined to destroy itself.  It is mortality acting as a divine entity, which means it is a mortal who does what the divine does: create without constraint.  But it is also an Enantiomorph in itself: the combination of Void and Divinity.  The limit of the Sage's ability is determined only by the manner in which it was created.

Without question, are Captive Sages.  Dreamers, trapped in a void, alone, with nothing but themselves for company.

So here we are at the most important point, so he has knowledge like that of a Master.  But he is also truly alone, being Captive, and from this desire for companionship, for Love, he creates from within himself.  The Sage starts to dream, and that dream becomes as real as that Sage can make it.

If a Captive Sage has the knowledge of a Master, a Captive Sage, a witness to the Foul Murder of Nerevar and the joining of ALMSIVI with the Heart of Lorkhan, wounded and trapped beneath Red Mountain the Heart spoke to him, and gave him terrible knowledge, and in his solitude he began to imagine a dream of Ash and Terror.  He Loved his dream, however

But what if a Captive Sage came to his divinity by the way of CHIM?  What if he was a dreamer within a dream, deprived of senses, in the black prison he entered of his own free will, he will begin to dream so his Love can keep him company.  This is why the Amaranth is described as being in Love.  Let's take a bit from the [Loveletter](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/loveletter-fifth-era-true-purpose-tamriel):

&gt;God outside of all else but his own free consciousness
C0DA Digitals have confirmed that a subject in sensory deprivation begins to hallucinate after only twenty minutes. Scale unto this along the magical spectrum and maintenance of time, “This is the love of God.”

&gt;Why Love?

&gt;Know Love to avoid the Landfall

&gt;The New Man becomes God becomes Amaranth, the Amaranth cherishes and adores all that is come from Him.

Come to the House of We.  When the Amaranth becomes

In closing, will take some time): Numerology in the Sermons works with other numbers as well. In the most basic example:

1: The Tower. Also the number of Nerevar

1 and 1 together: 11, a repeating symbolic comparison that reoccurs constantly in Kirkbride's metaphysics system. They are identical to all but the most wise. If the two worked together, imagine what they could achieve?

1 + 1 = 2. The Enantiomorph. Nerevar plus his opposite

1 + -1 = 0. Zero Sum. The Tower plus its negation, so to speak.

&gt; ""29. 2. 9. 11. 7. 18.""

&gt; ""Then it gets all messed up with 4.5.""

These next few posts will deal with the existence and concept of numerology in the 36 Lessons, judging from my relatively meek fumbling.

The easiest thing to do is to start with the framework of numbers

    29: The Captive Sage
    2: Enantiomorph
    9: The Missing
    11: The Number of the Master
    7: The Sword at the Center
    18: The Egg
    4.5: I'll deal with this later
    
These numbers and their titles indicate that we are looking at a system of numerology.  There are a ton of [numerological systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerology) in the real world, because the myths of man are universal in their images.

[This website](http://www.ridingthebeast.com/numbers/) collects a diverse selection of meanings for many numbers in many systems

Every number is a concept.  The way you combine those concepts together has an equivalence in mathematics.  For example, Aleph (1) and Bet (2).  Together they add up to three.  The Hebrew word for Mother (Am) is Aleph (1) plus Mam (40) which is 41.  Add the two together, Mother + Father, and you get 44.  The Hebrew word for Child is Yeled.   Ye(10) plus Le (30) plus D (4) is 44.  Mother + Father = Child.  3 + 41 = 44.

The process of addition is symbolic as well.  As you can already tell, there are many characters who match or share these concepts.  The relationship between these numbers will lead us into the Amaranth itself, so let's cover them one at a time.

**29: The Captive Sage**

The Captive Sage actually first appears in Sermon 28

Bound in the Ruddy Man's armor, because it's important that you understand the process.

So if nothing else, as a result, hallucinating a product.

**2: Enantiomorph**

Read this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chirality_(chemistry)

An enantiomorph is the combination of two mirror-images.  Think of it as the combination of Yin and Yang that forms the Tao.  Mostly this is the term used to describe the interplay between Anu and Padomay

The content of Sermon 2 is also relevant to the Hunt.  In the last third of the Sermon, is visited by Mephala, his Anticipation.  Mephala takes Vivec from his mother's womb, blinding her in the process, and Vivec takes from Mephala many secrets.  This is an Enantiomorphic Event; the combination or interaction of Vivec with Mephala, and the blinding of the witness to the event, Vivec's mother

**7: The Sword at the Center**

This was a tough one for me.  The trick is that you have to understand what a Sword symbolizes in the 36 Lessons, which will become relevant later in this section.

But aside from being one of the Six Walking Ways to reach heaven by violence

The Sword can also represent improvement by removing the excess.  Trimming fat from lean.  Pulling weeds from your garden.  By destroying everything that is not beautiful or useful

The Sword at the Center, as the ""Center"" is the void at the center of a Wheel.  The Wheel itself deserves an essay of equivalent length, but for the moment let's just abbreviate it by saying that a Wheel is a dream, a concept, a religion, and a system.  And perhaps it is all those things at once, because perhaps all those things are the same.

The Sword at the Center is mentioned by name as a ""threat"" hanging over ALMSIVI.  It's not hard to guess that this could mean the Nerevarine

For the purposes of the 36 Lessons system of numerology, rebuild"" sense), or division.

**9: The Missing**

The easiest comparison here is Shezarr, which include YSMIR, so there is a connection made to the concept of Shezarrines and of powerful Mortal beings.

However, the absence of a concept.  This can also mean mortality, or the introduction of mortality to divinity, and by extension Man, or mortal creatures (including Mer) in general.

**11: The Number of the Master**

After the ""prelude"" of the 36 Lessons, and in Sermon 11 we are introduced to the concept of the Ruling King, the Master of the World.  The exact definition of a Master is never given to us, but there are several, and Vivec is one, Nerevar another.

One possible definition of 11 is given as the concatenation of two 1's, an event of immense import and a symbol of royal power.  We learn that the Sharmat and Nerevar are indistinguishable except to Vivec, and this also means that the Sharmat is a Ruling King, but one who is endangered, something made obvious by the etymology of his title, [Shāh Māt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checkmate#Etymology), (in English: Checkmate) which means ""The King is Helpless (or ""ambushed

The 36 Lessons are Lessons written to instruct the next Ruling King, the importance of the 36 Lessons to the Landfall, as described in the Loveletter, might lead you to believe that the Next Ruling King has not yet arrived.

*This time I'd like to request that no inquiry be made in relation to how I managed to reach the realm of Coldharbour. It involved some... Unsavory rituals, that's beside the point. On with the book...*

Coldharbour. It is, Coldharbour looks like the city of Kvatch did after it was ransacked by Daedra. But across all of Tamriel. It was absolutely spirit-crushing, seeing my favorite places lying in ruin. But it was, at the same time, a kind of beautiful place. Everything had been replicated, even the White-Gold Tower was there, but sideways, which met the same fate. The palace of Molag Bal was magnificent

The King of Rape granted me access to his realm, as though the place had been raided by bandits. As I have mentioned, the White-Gold Tower and the Statue of Akatosh, both shattered. The College of Winterhold, with its massive library floating in the Sea of Ghosts, a horrific sight for any scholar.

But The Lord of Domination also told me a few things. A few very interesting things.

""I take it you know of Lorkhan? In yor mortal terms, he is nothing of the sort. He shed me and some of my siblings at the beginning of the Wars, and I grew independent, not content to just wither and die like many of his other spawn. That's not to say that he and I don't have anything in common, though. His most mischievous tricks are now my most devious tools of domination. I learned from his clever ways, and replaced the tricks with applications of force. Rather than convincing Creation to occur, I'd force them to give up their power for it. I always could use a little more space in the Aurbis under my wing.""

""Surely a scholar like you has also read of the Pomegranate Banquet? My cavorting with the Sharmat Vehk? What an adventure he wound up on after that. But it was such fun destroying all those spawns of us after we had finished, gone. But so many souls added. Ah, but this probably bores you.""

""The House of Troubles? Those three are incompetent fools. I'm the only one with any sense. Dagon won't listen to a word anyone says, but a bit dim sometimes. Even Boethiah got the better of him. But he's always willing to crush an enemy or foster an outcast at the same moment. And his Orcs. He just can't get enough of them. They are his beloved, but he is the most stern of fathers, never showing a hint of compassion, but always helping when the child falls. Almost... Admirable. Yet again, I feel like I'm boring you. What else do you want?""

""Vampires? My oh my were they a fun accident. Quite proud of my work on that one, though. They never do. Always some good bastard comes strutting in to save the day.

I am really sorry for the two day delay of the community thread. I've been very busy debating this weekend so I did not get the chance to post the thread earlier. Hopefully you guys can forgive my tardiness

So:

---

It seems this week has had a great recovery from the slow rate of thread posting in the few weeks before. The new changes miraculously were easily accepted by the community it seems

So yes

We have also had a rather slow but yet considerable flow of new scholars joining our ranks, with 67 new scholars this week. Again I would just like to stress how utterly important it is if you are a new scholar to:

1. [Read the New Scholar's guide to the subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/111sx2/the_new_scholars_guide_to_rteslore/) and

2. [Take some time to read through the FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/vs8w4/the_official_faq/)

Other than that, [Voryn's explorations of Khajiiti myths](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/11zpv9/the_time_gods_whiskers_and_other_khajiiti_myths/) and [The all new episode of the Elder Lore podcast discussing the Fall of the Snow Elves](http://elderlore.wordpress.com/episodes/season-three/09-the-fall-of-the-snow-elves/)

Thank you everyone for a great week of discussions and commenting. Keep on doing what you do so well!

Also

**Scholar of the Week**

I have to admit this week's pick was a rather easy choice. Everybody was doing an amazing job these last 9 days

I am, Ish, keep on doing what you do and I know you may win this award many a time in the future. You can now join Wuuthrad, Pedanterrific, Lilrhys, and Ornerycretin in the Scholar of the Week hall of fame (and drinking and tavern wenches).

---

That is all I really have to say. *As always* make sure to:

* Introduce yourself if you are new to the subreddit or have been lurking and want to start getting recognition
* Greet and congratulate the scholar of the week *or any other user you want to have recognized for his/her achievements*
* Tell me about your (Tad bit long of a) week
* Provide any feedback you might want to give to the mods about anything
* Do whatever. *This is* the Community Thread

I would normally say have a nice weekend but I guess the weekend is pretty much done

So continue doing your thing

1349366141.0,10xvoq,Edge-Witchery,,38,3,31,"This is a theory based on what I understand about the Forsworn.  Let me outline my understanding of the Forsworn first to lay a groundwork for discussion (and also so you can correct me where I'm wrong):

* The Forsworn are Reachmen
* Bretons are of mixed man and mer descent.
* The more ""cosmopolitan"" Bretons often seem to be culturally ""French"" (a gross generalization
* According to the High Rock edition of the ""Pocket Guide to the Empire, even for Bretons"" whose lineage ""...  partakes of nearly every race imaginable.""
* Their magic
* Reachmen venerate hagravens
* A recent post spoke of the potential fascination with Dibella
* In the room where the Sybil is being held (and in several other Forsworn camps) there's a werewolf being sacrificed or studied.  
* Forsworn have some manner of interest or issue with Spriggans

What I'm particularly interested in is this idea of ""hedgecraft.""  At first glance, we speak of something far away from civilization being ""out in the sticks.""  I assumed this was the same.  But the word ""hedge"" doesn't mean ""shrubbery"" or ""bush.""  It means ""border"" or ""fence"" and denotes the edge between one thing and another (often marked by bushes, hence the association).

It is my assertion that Reachman magic is hedgecraft ... or edgecraft

* Genetically, having become a midpoint between all races.  
* Culturally, seem to constantly bring in new sources of knowledge and magic which they mix and match with their own.  They look for magical edges as well.  
* Even the land they call theirs
* Much of what the Reachmen venerate seems to represent edges as well.  Hagravens are the edge between men and birds.  The sacrificed/studied werewolf is the edge between man and wolf.  Perhaps the Sybil (contrary to what another poster posited) isn't Dibella herself, while we're on the subject of gods, I recall at least a couple of hagravens praying to Hircine, the maker of werewolves.  

It makes sense that this kind of magic would be both powerful and dangerous.  The majority of the Aedra were formed from the mixing blood of Padomay and Anu.  My Boston Terrier (a border between French bulldogs and terriers) is devastatingly cute.  Rock and roll is a border between blues and country.  Starships run on matter-antimatter reactors.  Mixing the bleach (a base) and ammonia (an acid) creates a toxic cloud that can kill you.  Peanut butter and chocolate!  You get the point.

1342469550.0,wntff,A History of Horsemanship,lebiro,35,1,27,"Okay

The first conclusion I have come to is that horsemanship (that is

- Horses would be worse than useless in Black Marsh (few mammals can live there
- Khajiit have no use for horses
- Much like Black Marsh,_1st_Edition/Aldmeri_Dominion) ), and, much like the Argonians, can move through their environment far more easily than any steed. So Bosmer probably don't ride. 
- Dunmer and Orsimer have no real environmental reason to shun horsemanship (though Morrowind seems to be a poor environment for animal husbandry), we can see from the game Morrowind that horses are far from widespread in Morrowind, with guar (more suited to the environment) filling most equine roles.
- As for most ancient civilizations of mer, as their Cyrodiil was jungle, a poor place for horses.

There is no firm evidence of the Altmeri use of horses or lack thereof. From what we know of Summerset Isle and Altmeri culture, to a lesser extent, Dunmer) to abandon horses as they made their way into mainland Tamriel, which leads me to believe the Aldmer never rode. I believe that horses, when they appear in elven culture, appear as food, and that the only reason this is not believed of Altmer is that it does not fit the human view of them, Dunmer and Orsimer are seen as beastly and outlandish- eating horses fits perfectly with this). It is safe to assume that the Bosmer

It is possible that Altmer *now* ride horses, it is safe to assume they would resist the advancement to four-legged transport.

Okay, specifically the lands around the Bjoulsae river (perfect horse country- plains and a river). The [1st Edition P.G.E.](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/pocket-guide-empire-first-edition-high-rock) (my favourite lore source, you may notice) refers to ""The Horse-People of the Bjoulsae River"" (which, interestingly, ""YR"" complains are ""scarcely mentioned in text""). This is the only suggestion I could find of a strong horse culture; the fact they can be called ""Horse-People"" clearly suggests horses play a major role in their culture, and it seems to me that they were the first civilization to domesticate horses. It is also worth noting that, among other things, implying that the wider Breton civilization now tends towards mounted combat.

Referring once again to the P.G.E, and therefore I would suggest that the Nords learned the domestication of horses from their new subjects, the Bjoulsae river tribes (the worth of such a practice would be immediately obvious to any conqueror). From there, horsemanship spread across Imperial territory and became ingrained in human cultures. 

One more note before I finish: there are a handful of ""wild"" horses in Cyrodiil, not truly wild. There are three ""wild"" herds, each a different breed or colouration (one of chestnuts, one of bays and one of paint horses), which does not seem sufficient to constitute a true wild population, especially given their apparent isolation from one another. Additionally, remember that while modern Cyrodiil is a perfect place for horses, it was jungle

The biggest problem that arises from the aforementioned quote is

* How is Alduin

These are the best quotes out there in regards to the true nature of the Time-God. Upon taking a look at the first quote we see 2 sentences

So does that mean that the Akatosh of the Eight + One Divines is the same as Bormahu? Yes and No. No

 
**Who are Aka-tusk

* Aka-Tusk is another name for Borhamu and therefore Akatosh.

* Auri-el is the creation aspect of Aka-Tusk. One of the Tusks of Aka.

* Alduin is the destructive aspect of Aka-Tusk. Another of Aka's tusks.
 
* Alkosh? Enlighten me

1339164630.0,urkty,Do the Bosmer no longer follow the Green Pact?,lebiro,43,7,36,"As you may have noticed, [Niruin of the Thieves' Guild](http://uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Niruin). He doesn't share much

- He worked at his father's winery in Valenwood. The Green Pact dictates that Bosmer may not harm the plants of Valenwood (including grapevines I would presume). Now, why would they have taken the pains to distil alcohol from pig's milk or meat?

- He also states that """"I'd much rather earn a living liberating others of their coin this way than spending my days as a carpenter like my father"". Obviously this directly contradicts his other dialogue (unless his father is a carpenter who owns a winery...), and since it's there, we have to deal with it. 

Being a carpenter seems like an absurd occupation for a Bosmer. It is *categorically stated* that Bosmer cannot cut down trees, and are apparently intrigued by even the most basic feats of woodworking. The 1st ed. P.G.E. claims that Bosmer wear cartwheels as headgear because they find the idea of wooden things so exciting and bizarre (almost certainly a racist exaggeration, but the point remains). I suppose it's possible that a Bosmer would learn to use imported wood to make things, but it just strikes me as jarringly bizarre.

If we accept that Niruin is not lying, but I'll get to those in a minute. First, a question, on which most of this hinges:

Is the Green Pact a religious covenant that the Bosmer follow simply out of obedience to Y'ffre, but I'm fairly certain I read somewhere that the Bosmer witnessed the creation of the Earthbone governing shape, and so were not bound by it, and that the Bosmer swore to the Green Pact in exchange for Y'ffre granting them set form (which he can also take back for the Wild Hunt), so someone correct me if I am wrong.

Now the explanations:

If we assume that breaking the the Green Pact would not destroy or visibly harm/alter the Bosmer, and reduce the likelihood of nationalist defiance against the Dominion. Traditionally, endemic religious practices and traditions are common starting points for such rebellions, so it is vital to the Altmer that the Bosmer spirit is crushed into obedience.

This would make Niruin's family part of a *nouveau-riche*, there would be the possibility of Valenwood becoming the Dominion's Isengard. The ancient, untouched trees make for a huge natural resource, well capable of powering the Aldmeri war machine if the natives can be overcome. The Altmer are likely too proud to dirty Alinor with the workings of war, making Valenwood an ideal engine for their efforts.

For those who cannot bear to imagine this rather drastic change in Valenwood, who set up a winery in Valenwood and took a Bosmeri wife. Foreigners have always been somewhat rare in Valenwood, since it is rather inhospitable to most non-Bosmer, but with the re-founding of the Dominion, a sizable influx of Altmer would likely have immigrated.

When the first Dominion was formed, including exploiting business opportunities which cannot be exploited by the natives. 

The Green Pact still forbids the felling of Valenwood trees, whether it is purely tradition or a binding contract, it would not restrain the hands of an Altmer.

What do you think r/teslore? It seems clear to me that the Dominion would bring about significant change in Valenwood,,False,,t5_2t5ay,False,,True

1365353846.0,1buyn1,The Sow and the Snake,OPGreenback,38,5,15,"**The Sow and the Snake**

by Dura gra-Lorbul

*A Brief Introduction: Among the Orcish strongholds that pepper the northern provinces—largely found in Skyrim and High Rock, and I shall recollect it as well as I can. Note that I do not necessarily hold the perspectives within.*

The tale begins with the Sow and its litter of little piglets. It was raising its piglets, and teaching them to avoid dangerous predators, such as Snakes. The piglets loved the Sow, and the Sow loved its piglets, and they were happy.

So of course a Snake came along. There is usually a Snake listening to your conversations, hiding beneath the corpse of the god that the Nords call Shor. It took issue with the Sow’s lessons, its lessons of love and its lessons of avoiding Snakes. It took issue with the Sow’s words and with the Sow’s care for its litter.

The Snake rose up from beneath Shor’s corpse and said, but Snakes, such as I and Shor and others, teach the truth of the world. The world is harsh. You soften your children, teaching them to hide in your shadow and weep at the hardships of Nirn. You steer Aldmeris the way of stasis. And though you teach them of love, you teach them of the wrong kind of love. You must teach them of the Love that brings about ascendency, the Love of self and of all others that is I ARE ALL WE, tearful sack of—”

And before the Snake had finished speaking, tearful at the hilarity of the words of the Snake.

So the Snake ate the Sow amidst much spilled milk and panicked squealing.

And the Snake turned to the piglets, “See? The Sow was weak to the ways of the world. The Sow felled Shor, a Snake much greater than me, through trickery, but the Sow failed to survive a fair battle with me, Shor’s shadow. The Walking Ways are the Ways to ascendency, the Ways to I ARE ALL WE. But we Snakes do not have legs, we must teach others to Walk the Ways

The piglets squealed in terror at the prospect. The world was a thing to be sundered

So the Snake ate the piglets.

And the Sow, helpless, and the Sow Changed. The Sow Changed into the Boar, and the Boar gored the Snake from within. The Boar and its litter spilled out of the Snake’s belly, and the Snake fled, leaking black blood like the blood of Shor.

The piglets turned to the Boar, rather than the motherly love of the Sow. And instead of teaching wise lessons of avoiding Snakes and the like, he taught the knowledge that vengeance must always be carried out when called for, and that blood is the true currency of the world. The Sow had been weak to the ways of the world, but the Boar embraced the world, the Boar adapted to the world. The world had been a thing to be sundered, to weep at

The piglets returned to the pool of the Sow’s spilt milk, they took it as a material to forge their weapons and armors of, so that the Sow may protect them even after its replacement by the Boar. Today, that material is called Orichalcum.
And so the little litter of piglets donned the milk of the Sow and pledged themselves to the Boar.

To personally thank you guys and give you guys something special for the anniversary

So here it is:

**Ice And Scales:**

**Which culture is superior

Xeno:
---
Argonians are possibly the greatest race in Tamriel. Both their physical and cultural superiority over Elves

*Culturally*

The Argonians, to the point that the ""poor"" or ""weak"" of the culture are driven into rebellion. ElderLore talks about such roles in Tamrielic society. This endless cycle of inner conflict and oppression is a main weakness in societies such Nord society.

Truth is, by common pursuits and hiveminded beliefs that allow for the abolishing of a class-based society, allowing for equal rights and power to all, and thus creating a Utopia. See the Skyrim city of Windhelm for example. Khajiit, Dunmer, and even some Nords are poor to the point of complete oppression and hate from the Higher-class citizens. Entire districts are dedicated to the poor and starving while lucky individuals such as Torbjorn Shatter-Shield or Ulfric Stormcloak get to sit and eat all day. That is a corrupted, terrible society when compared to the great Utopia of Black Marsh.

*Militarily*

Argonians are by far superior to Nords or any other race in Tamriel.
Their leaders are better and far smarter strategically- as is known that the Hist are the most intelligent individuals on Tamriel and perhaps on Nirn as a whole.

They by far outnumber any other army, and the breeding is largely undisturbed as known by the fact that nobody invades Black Marsh and has the capability to kill Argonian females.
They are physically superior to any other race, more agile, and better at sneaking or charging than any other race.

Their training is better, as hive-mind effects take place in battle.

And even their weapons are greater. We know from the Infernal City that Argonians looted Dagon's realm. If they looted Void Salts and Dae Hearts you bet they stole swords and spears

So in summary

Lilrhys:
---

*Culturally*

The Nords have some semblance of what we call 'modern democracy'. Traditionally, this decision can be over-ruled by a challenger if the current ruler is too weak. This arrangement means that Skyrim is always ruled by the strongest/best person unlike in Black Marsh. Since the An-Xileel have took power in Argonia the Communist Utopia that may once have existed has disappeared. The An-Xileel, have created an Oligarchy in which they have complete control of the people. They become rich and powerful whilst everybody else become poor and weak. You use Windhelm as an example of inequality in Skyrim, so I'll use Lilmoth. Lilmoth is the 'festering jewel of Black Marsh' and it's definitely no utopia. Anybody who isn't a member of the An-Xileel, live in slums even foreign dignitaries.

*Military*

The Nords are the most militarily successful race in Tamrielic history. Ysgramor and his descendants invaded all of Northern Tamriel. Reman with the aid of his Nord allies conquered all of Tamriel except for Morrowind and the Septim Dynasty used Nord soldiers and generals to conquer and hold Tamriel. The Argonians on the other hand have never held territory outside the Black Marsh and the extent of their military success was a massacre of a people in crisis. The only time there has been an Argonian victory to be praised was during the Oblivion Crisis in which Argonians defeated a Daedric Horde. This however was not through military strength but rather strength in numbers alone. If an Argonian army were to meet the Nords on the field of battle

Therefore Skyrim is greater than Black Marsh because it's government isn't a corrupted cesspit and it's armies have proved their mettle time and time again.

Xeno:
---

To reply to some of your statements:

&gt; the Communist Utopia that may once have existed has disappeared

This is simply not true. You describe the An-Xileel as a government going against the ""old, but rather gained a better control of the Argonians through using actual Argonians to monitor activity.

&gt; everybody else become poor and weak

Only as ""poor"" or ""weak"" as they already were. No Argonian in Black Marsh lost property or class due to An-Xileelic control
Anybody who isn't a member of the An-Xileel
And is this not for the best? A bad apple in the Utopia can turn things to the worst. I'm sure even the Nords agree that foreigners should not be welcome in their culture. And yet

&gt; the Argonians on the other hand have never held territory outside the Black Marsh

Again, but due to pre-existing strength.

&gt; The only time there has been an Argonian victory

The only time? When a hundred Imperial traders tried to colonize and turn the Marsh into a trade province, was it not a victory? When a raging plague swarmed through Tamriel, killing thousands, and only the Argonians resisted the disease, was that not a victory? And most of all, when a race that has challenged the Argonians' might by enslaving them and looking at them as inferiors, the Argonians responded by massacring the race and driving them to a tiny snowy island in the Ghost Sea

So, injustice, a broken society, stupid straggles, and in-decision about leaders.
What do the Argonians have? Peace, a Utopian society, an invincible army and most of all, a home. A true home, at that, one they defend and never migrate away from.

Lilrhys:
---

&gt; This is simply not true.

I had forgotten that the An-Xileel are essentially controlled by the Hist but that does not make it any better. In fact it makes the whole system all the more corrupt. Unlike in Skyrim in which the Nords have some control for the direction of their government/nation the Argonians have none. The Hist have complete control over the Saxhleel and this is not a good thing. You may argue that what is best for the Hist is best for the Argonians but that isn't the case. Was 4000 years of slavery good for the Argonians? no but the Hist didn't do anything until slavery had been abolished and when Argonians were the least persecuted... Argonian society hasn't prospered either under Hist control. The only Argonians we ever see are poor and the only rich Argonians we see are heavily Imperialised.

&gt; And is this not for the best? A bad apple in the Utopia can turn things to the worst.

You complained earlier of racial hatred being a bad part of Nord society but you hail it as an intrinsic part of Argonian culture. Isolationism on an An-Xileel scale doesn't help a nation or people to grow and only helps to stagnate said nation.

&gt; The fact they have not held any other territories is not due to weakness

That seems like just a bad excuse. The Nords ideal homeland is Skyrim but yet they conquered and grew their territory. Just like the Altmer and the Imperials. It seems to me that the Argonians know that they could never win a true and fair war outside of their homeland.

As for their over supposed victories: a massacre of merchants cannot be heralded as a great battle and neither is the ability to survive a plague. Plagues nor merchants regularly appear on the field of battle. Also

&gt; They have hate, stupid straggles, and in-decision about leaders.

* Yes Nords hate but it isn't a part of their governments doctrine like in Black Marsh.
* There is hardly any injustice in Skyrim even with a Civil War raging and the re-appearance of Dragons.
* Nord society is still standing strong despite War splitting families apart.
* The indecision about leaders was only brought about due to Imperial intervention.
&gt; What do the Argonians have? Peace, a Utopian society, an invincible army and most of all, a home. A true home, at that, one they defend and never migrate away from.

Yes there is peace but only for now... once the knew world order establishes itself (whether it be Nord, many Argonians would regularly sell other Argonains to Dunmer slavers and mothers would sell their children into slavery for it was a better life. How can you call that utopian or perfect? Even now under relatively strong leadership Argonians live in extreme poverty. Their armies have never truly experienced War outside of their native marshes and even within their marshes have bowed down to both the Reman and Septim Empires. Yes, they have a Home as do the Nords: Skyrim. The Nords were born atop the Throat of the World remember?

Therefore Skyrim is the better nation culturally because they have the basics of a democracy and the Nords have somewhat of a say in the greater policies of Skyrim since any man or woman can bring up a subject to their Jarl. Militarily it is better than Argonia because the Nords have conquered and defeated every single Tamrielic race which only the Cyrodiils can compare to (and even they needed Nord strength to do so).

Xeno:
---

Before finishing off and summarizing my arguments I need to once again address what you have said.

&gt; You may argue that what is best for the Hist is best for the Argonians but that isn't the case.

You claim that the Hist are bad, Argonians would be nothing. Without the Hist, the horde of Tamriel's perfect race would be nothing more than lizards struggling to survive. This is no oppression, but rather reliance, and not only reliance of Argonian on Hist but Hist on Argonian. When Dwemer sought to cut down the forests of Black Marsh and drive the Hist to extinction, it was the Argonians that stopped them. The Hist need the Argonians as the Argonians need Hist, as could be observed in the far ancient times when Hist populations all over Nirn were protection-less against the crossfires of old Ehlnofeys' wars. Again, unlike the Nords

&gt; You complained earlier of racial hatred being a bad part of Nord society but you hail it as an intrinsic part of Argonian culture.

The difference here is the difference between complete Isolationism and simple racism. It is the difference between USA and Atlantis. While the Nords let in foreigners and then mistreat them as they let them be assimilated. That is bad. The An-Xileel

&gt; The Nords ideal homeland is Skyrim but yet they conquered and grew their territory

And immigrated from their own homes to the new territory only to rebel against themselves and establish different conflicting governments. Home is a place you protect and stay loyal to. Home is not a place you betray and fight. Skyrim is no home. Perhaps it was for the Snow Elves

So, yet Argonians live yet better, in the way of the future, perfect and equal. The so-called isolationism they exhibit is nothing more than precautions taken to drive away lesser cultures from destroying the unity of Argonia.

And unlike other cultures, they would fall like the Dunmer and Dremora. It is true that the Nords may have once been more powerful than the Argonians, to the point they claimed ownership over Black Marsh for their Empire, but those times have long past.

The Empire, families and nations fighting among themselves.

Black Marsh, and do so with the strongest weapons in Mundus.

So in a clash of Nords versus Argonians who would win? Why is that even a question?

Lilrhys:
---

Is reliance on another being a good basis for a culture though? Their reliance on the Hist isn't a fair an equal one since the Argonians are essentially the mortal arm of the Hist. There is no free will in Argonian Society only the will of the Hist. There is a facade of co-dependence but deep down there isn't any.

I do not think there is a difference between what you are saying. In Windhelm (which cannot be used as an example of wider Skyrim culture since it is a hugely complicated mess)

A homeland need not be united. The so-called United Kingdom is and never has been united and even the United States suffered a Civil War. A homeland is where your people can trace their lineage back to and call 'home'. Skyrim was where the Nords were born and it is where they have called home for most of Tamrielic history. The Nords expanded their First Empire too big and too fast and suffered the consequences when their territories rebelled against them (not other Nords) and threw them out.

Skyrim is a broken land at the moment yes but it could still defeat an Argonian invasion. The Argonians have complete dominance in the Black Marsh but they're forces wouldn't last a day against any Army outside of Black Marsh.

In addition, but with each being double strength (16-man) units, for a total of 800 men. This left the actual Legion as roughly 5,200 men, not including officers. Atop this, each Legion had an attached 120-man cavalry unit, likely used as messengers and scouts rather than a battlefield force,300 men before officers.

Each cohort was commanded by its ranking centurion, tenth cohort.



Now, there seem to be very few mages in the Legion, perhaps one in a hundred or less. With those numbers, it would make more sense to consolidate the Legion's mages into cadres of four or five in each cohort, likely attached to the first century.

More power than heavy infantry and more mobile than light cavalry, making for a perfect charge breaker or flanker.

So, is whether there are any actual official sources that shed any further light to either support or contradict these musings?

Before we get into it

**[When did you get into TES?](http://i.imgur.com/WjSr2.png)**

Can't say I didn't expect this

Other than that

Interestingly

**[When did you get into lore?](http://i.imgur.com/BXiom.png)**

Again, didn't get into lore until later. There are spikes again with each release.

The most obvious of those spikes is in 2011

A lot of people got into lore as soon as they got into TES

**[What was your first TES game?](http://i.imgur.com/RLpJu.png)**

This one was quite interesting. Morrowind proved to be the game that has introduced players to TES most

Many people commented on how Morrowind remains their favorite of the games

**[Which TES games have you played?](http://i.imgur.com/q7Ui5.png)**

Sure enough, which are likely ""trickle-down"" players from Skyrim, who also contributed a lot of plays in Oblivion and Morrowind's directions.

A handful of people have played the offshoot games

**[What game inspired you to get into lore?](http://i.imgur.com/8G3hY.png)**

Another interesting response. Morrowind definitely appears to be the most lore-inspiring game by a long shot (not that I didn't already know that). I didn't expect Skyrim to fall so short

A lot of people mentioned that browsing the internet got them into lore

**[For fun: What is your favorite race?](http://i.imgur.com/FQriZ.png)**

A lot of people mentioned more than one race

Unsurprisingly, however, was that a substantial amount of people who had not played Morrowind found them to be their favorite.

Bosmer were more popular than I anticipated, the rest of the races shared the votes rather evenly. The little sliver wedged between Orcs and Nords are the Chimer, who got a vote.

So there we go. Conclusions: The majority of scholars jumped on board in the last year or two, regardless of game.

A lot of liberties were taken in my recording, but that's only when I *really* got into lore. I could've easily said 2005. Many people I'm sure differed in what they considered to be ""into lore"". It's uncountable, so it's really going to be different depending on the person.

The entrance.  Possibly the strangest thing in all of Skyrim.  Simply none of it makes sense.  You enter what appears to be a simple Dwemer ruin, illuminating several assorted pots and vases, as well as two dead bodies.  Upon interacting with this light, you are trapped, and the light seems to begin scanning you, with some form of digital sound.  It is simply using signals, and they do have a physical quantity

Regardless

This part made me question something.  If the bandit bodies fell only when you entered, and what exactly was it...screeching?

Now we are brought to yet another oddity

No special quests take place in this cavern whatsoever, but that's it, and even then they send you through Stony Creek Cave, seemingly not aware of the alternative entrance.

And now back to the bones.  Some have suggested mammoth bones in the past



To summarize the massive number of questions about this place:

What is that sphere?

What was it screeching?

Why did it drop you

Who or what killed those bandits

What are those bones?

Why did the Dwemer put such an advance security system in place, or centurions inside it?

Why did the Dwemer care about this hollow mountain with some bones in it anyway?

Why is this entire massive cave not referenced or explained whatsoever in the game

Why exactly is this random mountain entirely hollow anyways?



There are a number of further questions that could be generated about this place, but I am at a loss here.  I've ran through everything from 'Crazy Dwemer' to 'KINMUNE' but nothing quite fits together here.

To me there seems to be a disease-like progression in Dagoth Ur's servants. The ash variety atleast. There's the [Ash Slaves](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Ash_Creatures#Ash_Slave), and are in the process of losing some of the skin around the sockets.  
  
Noticing this and then going back to [Ash Zombies](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Ash_Creatures#Ash_Zombie), which is popularly associated with decision making processes and memory, looks to have been degraded sometime in this transformation. The curse by itself might not be what puts the Dunmer under Dagoth Ur's sway, but rather the degradation of this essential brain matter. Hence the necessity of the collar in early stages, since the inflicted presumably have moments of free will and lucidity.  
  
I wanted to take this further and link the onset of this brain degradation to the obsessive compulsive dialogue of the Ash Slaves (""Everything is wrong. This is not straight. This is too high. This is in my way. We must put them right."")
  
So Ur's control on the subject might be somehow related to the degeneration of this area of the brain. Or rather
  
I love the parasitic hive mind thing going on here, and is trying to consume the godhead (ie, existence) so that he can be the godhead.  
  
**So my questions:**  
  
How does this relate to the blight and corpus? This transformation doesn't seem to be part of the divine disease
  
Why are [Ash Vampires](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Ash_Creatures#Ash_Vampire) not subjected to this transformation, and Ash Vampires are the nobility and leaders of the Sixth House. ""Tendrilification"", for whatever it actually does, seems to maintain the intelligence of the inflicted in its late stages though. Hence Ascended Sleepers being ""smart"" (source, the uesp page).

It is my understanding that in TES, such as the Grey Prince from Oblivion, and in books.

It is also my understanding that Bretons are the product of Altmer and a long line of men. If I am correct, Bretons should look like men but be good at magic and possibly taller (from the elf side). We know magic contributes to lifespan, so they also ought to live longer than Nords or other men. However, Bretons are both shorter and don't live as long as Nords or Imperials. This seems really counterintuitive to me. I just wondered if there was some lore-based reason for it, because I would prefer one of those over ""it was an oversight"".

Thanks! Sorry again if this has already been posted. I just had a lovely conversation with some TESblrite about it


EDIT: I'm unable to find my previous source for bretons living up to 90 years, but I know that's not where I read it.

Hello

This is the first ever *Weekly Community Thread*! This is a new project I'm starting

I will be posting these every week on Friday

The main goal of these threads will be providing space for a weekly community discussion. I also want to use these threads as a sort of ""feedback section"" where you guys can tell us mods what you want to add or change in the subreddit. The final goal of the Weekly Thread is to give credit to the fine scholars of our community.


So

**Weekly Summary**

We have had quite the nice week- with about two pages-load of threads. We have gained an awesome *169* subscribers this week, and of course the [Jel Language thread (I understand this was actually posted 8 days ago, but it was too good a thread in my opinion to not mention)](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/zfxy9/jel_language/)

I've been arguing among myself whether to remove [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/zs6mv/diseases_and_other_illnesses/c67b8fj) chain of comments

Basically

**Scholar of the Week**

I've had two options for Scholar of the Week, and will surely win some later weeks, I've decided to give the Scholar of the Week award to a different user who's been posting some good comments lately to balance things out.

So congratulations, especially in the last few days.

So that is it for the Weekly Thread. Please go ahead and tell me what you'd like me to add to the thread. Again, even make some community fan art. I believe PoP has already received a cool little drawing of him as Boethiah, why shouldn't I get a drawing?

We know the Thalmor are supremacists and want to restore mer dominace but other than that I just can't find any concrete evidence that they actually want to undo creation. I mean, I'm pretty sure that doesn't involve uncreation.

We don't know a whole lot about the Thalmor leaders other than they are secretive and likely manipulative. We do know that the Thalmor government is made up of both Altmer and high ranking Bosmer. I have a hard time believing the Bosmer that make up some of the high ranking Thalmor would go along with a plan to undo creation.

The inclusion of the Human-Tsaesci ghosts and skeletons in Oblivion could easily be chopped up to game development . Unfortunately

I think the main source of the Akaviri Conundrum is how unreliable and lacking in information the source books are. We have [Mysterious Akavir](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/mysterious-akavir),  Elvish text (referencing Lorkhan as opposed to Shezzar or Shor) that was poorly translated and abused as it travelled through the eras, considering the many strange and awkward phrasings contained within it. Tosh Raka ""has very many new ideas"", oh really, does he now? How incredibly nonsensical.

Next we have a much more reliable book, due to the thoroughness that the Lord Pottreid tried to go into for the sake of the report, it seems almost odd how little information was given regarding the descriptions of the Tsaesci forces. Perhaps this is from the lack of information the survivors had, or the Battlemages reported, but to me it would suggest that the Tsaesci's physicality was not remarkable enough to make a point of. He does mention the Tsaesci scouts as riding mounts, which could imply they have legs and not snake bodies, but

Besides these two documents, but a ~~fiction~~ *dramatization* of historical events, we also have passing mentions of their attacks on Tamriel, that again only goes so far as to say ""They were mean snake-men"", and not attempting to describe them in anymore more detail.

1355549038.0,14vsha,Miraak and the Greedy Man,TheGhostOfDRMURDER,38,5,4,"I'm sorry if this is discussed in the DLC itself, but it seems to me that Mirraak shares many similarities to the Greedy Man of Skaal myth

**Their Past**

What first comes to mind is Miraak's former position of importance as a dragon priest. Likely, would have been viewed by Nords as sacred spirits, the incarnation of their early-Aka entity that would likely evolve into the Skaal's All-Maker.

When we compare this brief summary of Miraak's past to the Greedy Man's we see a few similarities. The Greedy Man was also once a member of the Skaal until he turned against ""the All-Maker

**Their Plans and Enemies**

Mirraak's return in Skyrim is marked by the corruption of the All-Maker stones, is to funnel the powers of the stones to him in Apocrypha so he may return fully to our plane. His plan is ruined by the arrival the Dragonborn, a person tied to neither the path of the Warrior, Wizard or Thief. The Dragonbron cleanses the stones and sets to defeat Miraak. What is also important is that Mirraak steals the souls of dragons to fuel his Thu'um, the Gift of Kyne.

The Greedy Man, robbing them of their power. This plan is ruined by the arrival of Aevar Stone-Singer, a character tied neither to the path of the Warrior, Shaman or Elder. Aevar cleanses the stones and goes to face the Greedy Man. The Greedy Man keeps to himself a ""bag of winds."" 

When one contemplates the connection to the Nordic Thu'um as the breath of Kyne, that we may feel the spirit of the All-Maker in our souls again."" If the All-Maker is viewed as an evolution of the proto-Nordic dragon-god, then comparison of the ""Winds"" to the ""Dragon-Souls"" becomes even greater.

**Their Curse and Names**

Miraak is never referred to as the Greedy Man in game, then. He greedily eats the souls of dragons. He greedily steals the power of the All-Maker stones. He greedily seeks to control the Skaal.

We then have their eventual fates to contemplate. At the end of Aevar's quest, please correct me.), which seem rather substantially different. We then also know that, according the the Seven Fights of the Aldudagga, that the Greedy Man is trapped ""half-outside"" of Kalpas, due to his attempts to hide ""under his mountain.""

I think this is another sort of historical half-remembrance. I believe Aevar lead, and the lost dragon souls being freed. His spirit then finds its way to Apocrypha, where it bargains with Hermaeus-Moria. He is somehow able to half-enter our realm, evidenced by his stealing of dragon souls, mirroring The Greedy Man's being ""half-outside"" of the Kalpa.

**Conclusion**

Now, enemy of the dragon-god, heart/being trapped under a mountain, scion of the Advesary/Padomay etc. Which for good reason draws the idea that he is simply the Skaal's idea of Lorkhan, so I propose the following explainations, assuming that my previous comparisons hold true.

1) Miraak and the Greedy Man are Shezzarines. They may or may not be the same person

2) Miraak is the Greedy Man. As a Dragonborn

3) The Greedy Man is Lorkhan

If this has been discussed before

So

Obligatory TL;DR: Miraak shares many similarities to the Greedy Man. Are they the same person? Mantling the same person? Is one mantling the other? What do you think? 

**Edit Regarding Information Provided to Me by Regalnerd**

Thanks to regalnerd for correcting me on a few things I got wrong! See below for a summary and how I feel this works into my theory.

Miraak is referred to as ""the Traitor"" by the Skaal,"" apparently the progenitor of the Skaal people. This shares obvious similarities to the story of Aevar Stone-Singer, too, more so than what I previously thought.

To summarize both stories:

Miraak is a typical dragon-priest of the early Nords on Solsthiem. After a time, a blessing granted by Aka/Shor. He is an evil terror for a time and is defeated by someone called ""The Guardian,"" a powerful Shaman, eventually a wise Elder and ever-vigilant Warrior, and being banished from our plane. Miraak's name is avoided by the Skaal afterwards and he is called the Traitor. The Guardian then apparently founds the Skaal.

The Greedy Man is a typical member of the Skaals, before being defeated by Aevar Stone-Singer, a person who is neither a Warrior, Priest or Elder, and being banished from Solstheim. At the end of a Kalpa, he becomes trapped both in/out of the Kalpas.

Now

I find it likely that the authors of the story of Aevar Stone-Singer, and in support of my theory that Miraak is (at least the version of) the Greedy Man we see in the myth I propose the following as a ""true"" time-line, uncorrupted by seasons of story-telling.

Miraak is a dragon-priest to the early Nord settlers on Solsthiem. After a time, and seeks power for powers sake, tricking beings into his service, etc. He corrupts the dragon-stones, seeking their power, barters with Herma-mora, and generally makes an ass of himself. Aevar Stone-Singer works to undo his power, killing him and banishing his soul to Apocrypha. Aevar goes on to turn the early Nords on Solsthiem into the Skaal. Various stories about Aevar create stories which the people tell each-other in verbal tradition, is able to partially return to Nirn after a time.

There are, and the possibility that they are both different Shezzarines (of the worst kind) who are similar to each-other.

There isn't too much on UESP
&gt;In the context of Aevar Stone-Singer the All-Maker and the Adversary bear a resemblance to Anu and Padomay who are in a similar antithetical conflict.

&gt;Aevar Stone-Singer, who took away the strength of the people.

There's also some old posts that directly say the All-Maker is Akatosh and the Greedy Man is Lorkhan. But I don't think this makes sense at all. It's mostly because of one line from The Story of Aevar Stone-Singer.

&gt;The Adversary has many aspects. He appears in the unholy beasts and the incurable plague. At the End of Seasons

Everyone says that Akatosh is the All-Maker, is known for having many aspects (Alduin, Akatosh, Auri-El, possibly even Mehrunes Dagon and Azura). But the main thing that gets me is this: ""At the End of Seasons, we will know him as Thartaag the World-Devourer."" One of the Adversary's aspects is Thartaag the World-Devourer, of which there is only one parallel. Alduin the World-Eater.

In addition, Lorkhan is the one who originally had the idea to create Mundus and is directly responsible for the creation of the mortal plane.

I submit that

I've been reading up on some of the more esoteric aspects of TES lore, death, and rebirth of Mundus, with one big change occurring in each cycle that makes it different from each previous kalpa. Many seem to theorize that in the current kalpa, the emergence, victory, and ascension of Tiber Septim is the big difference, prior cycles have never had a Septim dynasty

Now for the Towers. These structures and their associated Stones stabilize Mundus and keep it from collapsing back into a formless state of Aurbis. The Thalmor are working to sabotage these Towers in an effort to escape the mortal coil and return to a higher state of existence in union with their gods.

So what happens if they succeed? Does the destruction of the Towers simply end the current kalpa and initiate a new one? Or would this be a premature return to the state of chaos/stasis, but do they (or any mortal) know about kalpas?

And one final question on a slightly different note. We know that:

*There is one major difference in the timeline of each kalpa

*These changes accrue from cycle to cycle

*The Aedra seem to intervene to help maintain Mundus

*(not sure about this one) The gods remember what happened in each previous cycle

Would it not be reasonable to assume that the one big change each cycle is caused by a divine intervention to extend the longevity of the kalpa? The ultimate result of this would be that the gods, will only grow more and more successful at extending the cycles so that each one runs longer than the last.

Hopefully that didn't all just turn into gibberish at the end. I know that final bit relies on a fair number of assumptions

Whole neighborhoods rest on the jeweled bridges that connect the islands together. Gondolas and river-ships sail along the watery avenues of its flooded lower dwellings. Moth-priests walk by in a cloud of ancestors; House Guards hold exceptionally long daikatanas crossed at intersections, adorned with ribbons and dragon-flags; and the newly arrived Western legionnaires sweat in the humid air. The river mouth is tainted red from the tinmi soil of the shore, and river dragons rust their hides in its waters. Across the lake the Imperial City continues, merging into the villages of the southern red river and ruins left from the Interregnum.

Reading about these cities is pure magic, and now they're inevitably going to mess everything up and make it as bland as the IC, because they've taken a bigger bite than they can chew. There's just no way they can pull off the walking tree-cities of Valenwood, the glass cities of the Summerset Isles or the massive graveyards of Necrom in *one game*.

So yeah... That's my biggest fear. They can mess up the combat and gameplay all they want, no one can claim that the IC actually looks as awesome as it was first described, and the descriptions of the new cities will be lazily written off as hyperbole as well, instead of actually living up to the magic.

1336159338.0,t7ahv,Validating the MMO lore-wreck,elderscroll_dot_pdf,38,6,22,"Okay

Firstly, neither of which must be accepted. And thirdly, as a disclaimer, my second theory (of two), may sound very similar to Mankar Camoran or Vivec, but hear me out.

**Theory #1:**
So, been basically erased and replaced by an illogical fan-fiction. A key part of the MMO, however, is that it is set to take place ~1000 years before the events of TESV: Skyrim, i.e. 2E 300-2E 800. This puts the MMO in the time known as the Interregnum, before Tiber Septim became Emperor. As we here in /r/teslore know, Tiber Septim achieved CHIM, and this shows the extent of his power. Based on this godlike power that Tiber Septim has achieved, he probably did so not with manipulative intentions

**Theory #2:**
Again, and Tiber has achieved CHIM, we can begin my more conspiracy-theorist-like idea. So Tiber has the power to do as he pleases with reality, and with that power he could rewrite history as he saw fit. Seeing that his power allows him to do so, he does just that. He erases all recent memory of the war raging during the MMO. But, besides just calming Tamriel down a touch, he goes a step further. He tells epic tales of grandeur during the wars that he was a general in. Tales of grandeur that show him doing things that no man could do. That only a god could do. He uses his powers to make everyone think that everything before he actually *achieved* CHIM regarding himself portrayed him as a hero-god of men. Then, proceeded to follow up those tales with **real** exploits and conquests. He used the powers of CHIM to deify himself in others' eyes, with Ysmir's help

**OR**

He didn't assume his divine role as Talos, then perhaps they realized he was a fake after he died and somehow they overcame the CHIM-brainwashing because he was no longer present on Mundus. Whatever made the AD think Tiber wasn't a a god is still ambiguous, and, of course, this is just a theory.

**A few notes:**

* Upon checking [UESP's timeline for the Second Era](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Second_Era)

The Amaranth

Since it is (was) Easter I thought that I may try and explain a part of TES lore (a la MK) that has interested me for some time: the Amaranth. 
As a preface to this may I warn you that this is in deep MK territory and that you should at the least understand the concept of CHIM and also have the Loveletter at your side. In addition to this please understand that I am no expert in TES lore and that if in some aspects I am wrong please correct me.

So what is the Amaranth?
 To answer that question I must discuss the idea of Sub-Gradients within the Aurbis
&gt;all creation is sub-gradient.

First was the Godhead, Stasis and Chaos.

The interaction of Anu and Padomay created the Aurbis and therefore the wheel. From Anu and Padomay sprung their souls Anui-el and Sithis and from these came the Et’ada. 

From the Et’ada: Aetherius and Oblivion did transpire but there was one Et’ada who saw the limits of Order and therefore Aetherius but also the uncontrollability of Change and therefore Oblivion

And so the next sub-gradient is spilt into two. Mortal death and CHIM

Many believe that attaining CHIM is the final sub-gradient of AE

&gt;“You in the Fourth Era have already witnessed many of the attempts at reaching the final subgradient of all AE

As we can see from the Loveletter that states that CHIM is one of the many ways that the people of Nirn have come close to reaching this state. If doing so consciously or not is another question.

And now we can answer the question: What is the Amaranth (AKA the new man
As earlier stated CHIM is the leaping point at the bottom of the Tower of sub-gradients
The leaping point to a new tower full of you
&gt; A whole world of you.

And that is Amaranth
Half asleep
 
&gt;The New Man becomes God becomes Amaranth, the Amaranth cherishes and adores all that is come from Him.

This is my first attempt at something like this and admittedly I am not the best at explaining things and if anything is unclear (or wrong) please say.

Would it make any sense for a Vigilant character to go around to the various shrines and, beyond killing all the cultists for obvious reasons, collecting the artifacts to destroy/safeguard them?

The Translated Text of a Maormeri Oracle Bone


*Author’s Note: After the release of my transcription of the tale Raid on Pyandonea, and my inquiries failed to draw up anything significant until I received the underside of an old shell, covered in inscriptions. The shell underside—which appears to have been taken from the shell of one of the rare breed of reptiles known as ‘turtles’—came from an anonymous source without a note, and thus all I can draw from it is what is inscribed upon the shell itself. The bulk of the text appears to be an Aldmeris derivative, but there are traces of Ehlnofex, Daedric, and Ta’agra scripts throughout. The inscriptions are heavily damaged, with reference to Raid on Pyandonea, just as Raid of Pyandonea may have been a forgery of relatively recent generations

[Plume-Rainbow’d-Serpent?]: Malefactor of the Maormer people, Trickery Serpent, Inheritor of Lyrkhath’s Deceitful Role. During the early years of Mund, Magraashess banished her son Plume-Raindbow’d-Serpent from the sky, for Plume-Rainbow’d-Serpent had plotted to oust his mother from the heavens and take leadership himself, even going so far as to consort with [the-Hungry-Serpent], planning to allow the-Hungry-Serpent into the sky beneath [the-black-sky] to aid him. When Magraashess banished him, wishing to having a place in the sky proper once more, which was then whole, and that is why our land today is a mass of islands with sheer cliff faces.

~~I'd like to share an idea with all of you. You may want to read this[1] if you'd like as much context as possible, especially now that the editor (Haute Quêteure from the Editorial Initiative from lore forum) I was working with has gotten his notes on it back to me.~~

~~To sum up the Raid on Pyandonea in the event that you choose not to read it, the Atmorans set up camp on the beach. Orgnum approaches their camp and challenges the Atmoran leader, Dreadmund (who is an Ysmir), to a duel. Orgnum metamorphoses into a great Serpent and Dreadmund metamorphoses into a great Dragon, and they fight. (I know, far-fetched, but it is more or less adhering to the old Nordic tradition that ""there's no better way to use up time without wasting it than by telling a good story."" If I ensure that the story's good

~~Now

~~I have a feeling that King Orgnum is an elven
~~
~~For one, from PGE 3: ""For much of Summerset's history, the Maormer have launched attacks against their sister child of Aldmeris. Every one of these battles have been led by Orgnum himself who it seems is not only immortal but grows more youthful by the century."" Because (an) Orgnum is defeated each time the Maormer travel north to invade, particularly noting the example of the invasion that was stomped out by the PSJJJ's storm, the only instance of the defeat of (an) Orgnum that was recorded in detail, (""King Orgnum and all of his ships had been utterly annihilated,"" implying (the) Orgnum's death, a new one takes his place

~~We have no detailed description of Orgnum. The Orgnum that is spoken of could easily be many different individuals. And now, but I take that to mean that Orgnum is said to be Sep. The Serpentine Lorkhan. If each Orgnum is a warrior who follows Auriel/Aka('s will) and is blessed by Sep (a 'Serpentborn'), well, then the Orgnums are then inverse Ysmirs, as Ysmirs are warriors that follow Shor('s will) and are blessed by Aka (the Dragonborns). And, in my text at least, it is assumed that the Dragonborns and Serpentborns can literally turn into Dragons and Serpents, while I'm entertaining fancies

~~Now, and it seems to fit, to a certain degree. Although my speculation is built upon only a few supports, I feel that those supports are strong.
~~
~~As an aside, because it hints that perhaps the blessers overrule the masters, what with the Shor-follower Atmoran mirroring Auriel's act and the Aka-follower Maormer mirroring Lorkhan's defeat.~~

~~I'd love to hear some thoughts as to whether or not this theory is feasible at all. If it sounds good and fits together (although built on next to nothing), I'll likely pursue it anyway, because I'm sure that the Nords would happily turn a mythic enemy-hero into an intrinsic opposite of their own heroic staple, despite indications that enemy-hero is not an intrinsic opposite such as that. But again, I'd love to hear your opinions. I wasn't planning to make a public post, because I intended to horde the idea to myself until such a time that Raid on Pyandonea was finished, fixed up and fattened up (I've only corrected a little bit since Haute sent me his notes), likely by way of having Dreadmund fight a new Orgnum after defeated the other. But Xenoposeidon convinced me after I sent the theory to him.~~

1365470501.0,1byjl1,On the History and Politics of Akavir.,alexxerth,40,10,10,"Continuing my studies on the continent of Akavir

The continent has a very different political climate than Tamriel, only two major empires, and then some smaller nations, which are still very powerful. Instead, Akavir has at least four major empires, with many other smaller nations (I mean very small, to the point where they are likely the size of a single hold)

The four largest empires are Kamal, and Ka Po'Tun.

These are well known


Tsaesci (Pronounced Say-Es-See)- This nation is one of snake-men (though it's unknown exactly how snake-like they are, though the two are not exactly related. Their primary source of both food and labor is goblins. The feudal nature comes into play here, as they Tsaesci themselves are all the 'lords' of this relationship, with the goblins playing the serfs. Rather than working for protection, they work to avoid being eaten. They are largely peaceful, as the townsfolk are known to leave towns immediately when an approaching army draws near, but they do have a large army capable of defending or attacking as needed.



Tang Mo- Perhaps one of the most interesting of the nations. These are Monkey-people (perhaps similar to the Khajiit, but is one of the most peaceful nations on the continent, and the people are very nice. They are able to muster up an army if they need to, indicating some form of organization.

Kamal- This literally means ""Snow Hell"". It's not quite known what the people here look like

Ka Po'Tun- This empire is the most powerful empire on the entire continent, who is essentially immortal. They are terribly at naval battles.


Other races/nations: For completion, two races of dragons; black and red. There were, or are, men on the continent. There are Goblins, as discussed earlier.


The earliest history we know, the Tsaesci decided they also wanted to 'eat' the dragons on the continent. They enslaved the red dragons, later to use them as war mounts. The black dragons fled to the nation of, what was then, Po'Tun (literal translation; Tiger Empire) and it became Ka Po'Tun (Tiger-Dragon Empire). At this point, a great war broke out between the Ka Po'Tun and the Tsaesci nations, one that severely weakened both nations, though this is conjecture). The goal of the people in Ka Po'Tun since this time, a Tiger-Dragon (Complete with orange/black striped scales). This is the absolute largest dragon in all of Nirn. This is about where our linear history ends actually

After this, every summer when they thaw out. The Ka Po'Tun help in defending the Tang Mo from the most modern source we have, but this was not always the case. Tang Mo was almost enslaved by every other major nation on the continent. At some point after all of this, the Tsaesci invaded the Empire, failed, and were invaded by the Empire. Our knowledge of history ends here, as there have been no further expeditions or attacks since 3E 290.

Other than that, of what races.


Outside of the continent, Yneslea, Esroniet, and Roscrea, as wella s the continent of Pyandonea lie between Tamriel and Akavir, 

It is interesting to note that the Tsaesci invaded Tamriel



Modern Akavir is difficult to discuss.  While many presume it is warring within itself, and the Imperial attack on them, it is possible that the Ka Po'Tun, allied with Tang Mo, easily took them out. It is suspected that the Ka Po'Tun's Tiger-Dragon leader may be planning to attack Tamriel, but this is a little known subject.  If this does occur; grave devastation would be brought upon Tamriel.  It is unlikely that the forces of Tamriel would be able to oppose such an attack.

1365123264.0,1bpa01,On the Tsaesci species,alexxerth,41,10,37,"My theory here is simply that the Tsaesci is fully humanoid.

The evidence for this is varying, so I'll put this in bullet format, with more information below.  **If you want a quicker read, skip to part 5, and that contains the most convincing evidence**


1. There is little consistent information on the appearance of the species.


3. Much of what can be said is likely mistranslations or propaganda.

4. The genetics don't add up.

5. Developer commentary on this is still open to interpretation.

6.  Several key pieces of culture don't fit quite right.


So there are the points

Firstly: There is little consistent information on the appearance of the species.  Some sources state them as being entirely snake like, so they are snake-men in this way, keep this in mind as it is important in part 4.


Second: Much of what can be said is likely mistranslations or propaganda.  While the race is likely vampiric, if a race was large enough to be established on Akaviri, where the Tsaesci already existed, it would be unlikely that they would be entirely destroyed.  Furthermore, they were somewhat snake-like, but not entirely so.  These two things allowed Tamriel's writers to puff up the details, and purposefully 'mistranslate' information, 1st edition"" states nothing on the snake-body of these people

Third, and the Aldmer might have mated with great cats and made Khajit (I don't personally believe that theory), so it's possible that there could be inter-species relations.  However, if the Tsaesci are truly half-snake, or full snake, then there would be no...matching parts so to speak. Regardless of that, snakes have eggs.  If this understanding of genetics doesn't really apply to TES, I'm confident in the rest of the evidence.

Part 4 speaks of the developer commentary on the subject.  In Oblivion, at the very least, not full snake.  As I said in part 1, they could just be men with snake-like scales.  This still fits that description.  This is also why they are vampiric.  However, this is MK's words, so it can be contradicted later.


Part five is where I draw the bulk of the evidence from.  First, comes from Tseasci.  Blades armor has leggings though.  Why would a people with a large snake like lower body need leggings?  Of course the option that the Blades simply added that part, and the original Tsaesci armor did not have this comes up, and therefore this bit of evidence is minimal at best.  However, another cultural point comes up; the dragon symbol on Imperial armor.  Where did this come from?  Well the answer is that is not actually the Tsaesci, however their presence did reaffirm the symbols worth.  This was because the Tsaesci's chosen war mount was dragons.  Think about this for a few minutes.  Perhaps I should have put this first, as this is likely the best piece of evidence.  Find out why yet?  How does something with one long slithery lower body **mount a dragon**?  It can not be done unless they physically tie themselves down, either way making it an ineffective and ultimately useless mount.  They would need legs to properly ride a dragon.





So there you have it.  With all that written out, but I cross-checked this information so it should be 99.99% accurate.  However, there is of course the option that I missed information somewhere that could help or hurt my point.  Please do post this, as I am interested in determining the true form of the Tsaesci.",,False,,False,t3_1bpa01

 I also find his name rather strange. It sounds like an acronym. ""ONE MEN LED IN"" maybe? GONE MEN LED IN?
 He's knowledge about the sigil and the whereabouts are fairly dubious as well in the sense that he does not give explanations about how he came to know this things.

You might've noticed a bit of a difference in this week's Community Thread - *I'm* doing it, I'm leading this week's Community Thread, and Rhys'll take the next one. Obviously this isn't my usual job, so if this is all a little awkward, it's because I have no idea what I'm doing.

I suppose it's a good time to explain again what these are all about. As you all know, but unmoderated playgrounds in which to enjoy ourselves.

**Weekly Overview**

The subscriber-boom is calming down now (probably a good thing)

The week has seen the production of some great explanations and texts, and *[""What is Love?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/18gt8w/what_is_love/)* by /u/RottenDeadite. A couple of forum-frequents have presented us with their brilliant texts; dinmenel's *[""Tsirelsyn's Bound""](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/18ozrr/tsirelsyns_bound/)* and Haute's *[""Winterhold Forthrow Headway-Bewrit""](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/18p3cd/winterhold_forthrow_headwaybewrit/)*. The past few days have been marked by busy scrambling over the memospore ARG, which you can check up on [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/18mqw0/memospore_megathread_ii/).

If it were possible, and the ones deciphering codes from here (I'm looking at you, IRC-hermits). However, it would be a crime to ignore the passion and dedication of one individual, who put everything on the line in the name of academia. For [this legendary feat](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5Wp9E0al8E&amp;feature=youtu.be), it is only fitting that this week's title goes to **/u/Gerka**. You're a real hero.

1357906669.0,16djjd,New Words by Clan Mother Ra'Paahrmi,Mr_Flippers,40,8,20,"These words are here for kittens to know more about Khajiit and the worlds birth

Ra'Paahrmi knows you read this after Ahnissi's tale. She knows you know of Ahnurr and Fadomai

First, this difference was Fadomai's nature.

They had their first cat, for what could vary speeds more than a cat?”. Alkosh was most important for time, for Alkosh's children would become parts of time themselves.

And then came Khenarthi

And then came Magrus

And then came Mara

And then came S'Rendarr

Many phases past and something changed. Ahnurr wanted the children this time and Fadomai tolerated the idea. It was very strange that Ahnurr would want more

Fadomai then gave birth to the next litter. The next litter was strange, but these we do know.

Fadomai would talk to this litter and to the first of this litter was Hermorah, yet Hermorah would know.

Hircine

Merrunz came after

Mafala the Clan Mother followed. Mafala was the first Clan Mother

Sangiin the Blood cat came after. Sangiin was blood

Finally came Sheggorath

Ahnurr was no longer patient and told Fadomai “We have had our litters

Khenarthi was lonely in her height where none could travel

They gave birth to Jone and Jode, the lush forests and magnificent sands. Finally came Azurah, the dusk and the dawn.

Jone and Jode were happy together

Whilst still birthing the last kitten

Finally, the darkness become more and knew what it was. The Darkness became Namiira.

Fadomai knew she had little time to live and talked to Jone and Jode

Then Fadomai went to Nirni and told her she would birth as many people as Fadomai did. Nirni was pleased

Then all of the children had left for Fadomai to be in peace with her death, take one of them and change them. They must be the fastest, cleverest and most beautiful people and you will call them “Khajiit”. Khajiit will climb better than all of the other children, for if Jone and Jode are taken off course, they must climb Khenarthi's winds and return their gift. Then she told Azurah that Khajiit must be the best deceivers from Nirni, for they must always hide their nature from the children of Ahnurr, who can do what Ahnurr no longer can. Finally, for Nirni will be jealous of your gift and try to hurt Khajiit in spite of them and change their land

And right before Azurah

Many phases passed and Nirni came to Lorkhaj telling him “I was told to birth many children like mother Fadomai

When making the new place, Magrus and his followers ran away, into their own realm where they escaped Lorkhaj's harmful tricks. But Alkosh and his followers stayed to finish it, for Alkosh had his own plans for the new world. When many of Alkosh's followers died or were weakened to make Nirni's path stable, the survivors went to Lorkhaj in anger. Alkosh and his weakened siblings cursed noisy Lorkhaj, so that he would walk Nirni for many phases away from his brothers and sisters. Alkosh ripped out the heart of Lorkhaj with his claws and hid it away, deep within Nirni.

Nirni was upset but

Alkosh had birthed his own children, you will devour all of Nirni's children, but I also bless some of Nirni's children to write my history. If you become greedy, Alkosh and Nirni's children will fight you back into slumber until you learn humility”. The first-born understood and rested. Some men in the mountains today claim they know the first-born by name, but if the Clan Mothers do not know, who could?

Nirni was sad, sister. Azurah will gift you with new people”. Azurah then told her siblings Jone and Jode the first secret and they let her pass. Azurah then took some of the forest people who were confused, unknowing if they were mer or beast. Azurah called them Khajiit and her secret knowledge let her form them into all different shapes, so that even if one could not complete a task, Khajiit could work towards it and complete any goal as Khajiit. Then Azurah told them the second secret and Khajiit learned the value of keeping secrets. Azurah then bound them to the Lunar Lattice, as the secret defenders of Nirni must be. Finally, Azurah spoke the third secret to Jone and Jode

However

Y'ffer, but Y'ffer did not realise the problem with his shouting. Azurah quickly closed the ears of angry Ahnurr and noisy Lorkhaj so that they alone could not hear the first secret, for such knowledge could put all of Fadomai's descendants in danger of Ahnurr's claws.

Pain! The Kaan-metal hammer pierced my head, but felt the cold sleep coming again. Then, something different. I felt alone, as if I were pulled from tiid and kopraan, and I heard a great wind rush towards me. I saw my ruined body, then saw the arrogant little man, and a cold pang ran through my mind. Moments before I was wrenched from my body, but it was too late. 

Darkness. There was nothing. I was alone in nothing. I am not dov, JUN AND SULEYK. A Voice cried ""Force!"" unsure, unsteady, but dripping with life. I felt like I were craning my neck, but I had none to stretch out. I felt the rays of the krein, but all I saw none. Then, as soon as it had come, the power, yet indifferent.

.

Solitude. I was alone. I felt nothing, and again I felt the rush of his power. I felt this many times afterwards, but never quite as clear as the first time. I felt him grow, as a kiin learning dovah zul. His Voice grew stronger, clearer, yet he only spoke Force. I was puzzled, if such a thing is real. Am I existing enough to feel such a thing in hahdrim? Do I even possess one anymore? 

.

Fron. I feel another. Fron! Stay away! You shall find only the Void here!

Too late. The Dovahkiin devoured another, for I am I. I am Mirmulnir! I can find myself in the Void, and the other, the sot one. He knows little of the outside world. Perhaps he will recall more when he grows to know the Void.

Doubt. My minds are in turmoil. I am Mirmulnir, and several nameless kendovah. We are I, and I are we. The Dovahkiin grows stronger by the day. We cry out in one Voice to our brethren, begging them to stay away, yet it does no good. His wrath is an all-consuming yol, and we are but od before it.

My first question is the whole Nirn/Mundus thing, here is where things start to confuse me, the et'Ada who gave themselves to creating Mundus are known as Aedra and can be either Anu or Padomay in origin, I think this is because Lorkhan came from Padomay although I could be wrong, anyway, the ones who didn't are Daedra, so, if so why are there corpses

Another thing I have read that ALL of the Aedra gave their power for Nirn

Also, each aedra gave all their power for a particular planet and so have 'become' that planet. Lorkhan is the one who gave himself for Nirn. How wrong am I?

Is Nirn Mundus? And the planets are merely how people percieve the Aedea's corpses floating around in Oblivion? 

And Aetherius

Are Anu and Padomay still alive in the Void? Does the Void even still exist with Mundus

Fast forward to now and another theory I'm thinking about. Instead of making a new post I thought I might add it here. So here's my edited version /r/TESlore........... Because I like you more.*

Author: Wolf Lesser-Dragon

Scholars and Mages alike I present to you today the first of hopefully many dissertations and essays to come from our new and prestigious Ysmir collective. As it is the first study of our Institution I thought it'd be wise to begin with a paper on Ysmir

**The Importance of Ysmir.**

The famed ""Dragon of the North"" appears many times in Tamrielic history and usually as a bearded hero of Men who massacres the heathen Devils (Elves)  in the name of Shor and sometimes even over the Cyrodiilic Akatosh. The first mention of Ysmir in recorded history is in the book ""Before the Ages of Man[^1](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/ages-man)"" by Aicantar of Shimerene and tells of a warrior-king-who-goes-by-many-names.

&gt; Also during the Late Merethic Era the legendary immortal hero, and king variously known as Pelinal Whitestrake, Harrald Hairy Breeks, Ysmir, Hans the Fox, etc., wandered Tamriel, conquering lands

From that list 2 names immediately come to the fore: Ysmir and Pelinal Whitestrake, as the Ayleids called him, was a hero of the early Cyro-Nords who helped lead the nascent Alessian Rebellion against their Ayleid oppressors. For these feats many a song was written about him by early Skalds and from the many fragments of these songs ""The Song of Pelinal[^2](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/song-pelinal)"" is formed. From this song we can gleam a lot about his relationship with the Gods which is very important in finding Ysmir's origin. The 2 main Divine (and most important) links to Pelinal are through the gods Shor and Aka. The link to Shor is shown within Volumes 4 and 5 which state that the Nord armies would say that they could see Shor in him and that some even called him a Shezzarine, an avatar of Shor. The connection to Aka-who-also-goes-by-names comes from a quote from Pelinal himself:

&gt;""O Aka

Here Pelinal is attesting that his madness is caused by Aka's madness (see Et'Ada

The next Ysmir to appear in our histories is the Nord Hero-King Wulfharth of Atmora. Wulfharth, Dragon of the North; and from therein it is plain to see that Wulfharth is an avatar of Shor. The final Ysmir I shall be discussing is Tiber Septim. It is common knowledge within the Empire that the Greybeards announced him to be Ysmir, Dragon of the North, during his rise to Empire and Godhood. We also know that Tiber Septim was a famed Dragonborn who relit the Dragonfires of Akatosh and wore the Chim El-Adabal of legend. Hence Tiber Septim is linked to Akatosh.

Unfortunately though both Wulfharth and Tiber are only connected to 1 out of the 2 Gods but the Arcturian Heresy[^5](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/arcturian-heresy-0) written by Ysmir Wulfharth states that the God Talos was actually 3 different people Hjalti Early-Beard (the Dragonborn), who provides Aka.

Therefore we now have 2 Ysmir's (Pelinal and Wulf-Hjalti) who have links to the Enantiomorphic duality of Lorkhan-Auriel

YSMIR AS PELINAL: FAILED (for there was no duality)
YSMIR as TALOS: SUCCEEDED (for the duality was embraced)

Ysmir as Talos ""Reached Heaven by Violence"" by which I mean attained Royalty by which I mean achieved CHIM. When Talos saw the myth-echo of Ysmir repeating throughout Un-Void from Aurbis through Mundus into the Starry Heart

First we have the **Psijics of Artaeum**. We know that Ceporah Tower already exists on the island but

So while Ceporah may not have been a Tower at the time of the Intercept, it into one with the Eye of Magnus serving as its stone. They would likely have the knowledge to do it, and it seems likely that they know of the Thalmor's true intentions of unmaking Mundus so they would have an interest in stopping them. And what better way to do that than making a Tower on an island that can disappear and reappear at will?


Next we have the **Orcs of Orsinium**. It might be a bit of a stretch, their reason for building it is the same, to stop the Thalmor.

But how would they know of the Thalmor plot, so I don't think he wants them to be unmade. And he certainly has the knowledge of how to build a Tower.  He, as Trinimac, was standing on the zeroeth one when he helped make the first one after all. He might also be able to provide the Orcs with something powerful enough to serve as a stone for the Tower.


Finally we have the **Argonians and the Hist**. This would be another recent Tower, and have known for some time. Obviously they don't want the Thalmor to unmake the world, and what better way to prevent that than building a Tower in the middle of a swamp that not even a Daedric Prince could invade?

I'm not positive that they would have everything they need to pull it off though. The Hist may have knowledge of how to create a Tower

What I find particularly interesting about a possible Argonian/Hist Tower is what the physical Tower might be. The Bosmer Tower was a giant tree that held an entire city inside

**The Coronation of Eplear**

^(*Foreword and translation by Harman Maurus*)

*The Song of Eplear is a Bosmeri epic dating back to the First Era. It tells the story of King Eplear, needless to say, was a seminal moment in the history of the Bosmer and Eplear remains a giant in Bosmeri history. Strangely, however, his Song has never achieved the fame of the less historical epics of the Bosmer, such as the Dansir Gol or the Meh Ayleidion.*

*The poem itself is vastly lengthy, annotations, and comments that accompany many ancient copies of the Song could fill volumes of their own, and it is these I have aimed to collate and translate.*

*This section deals with the coronation of King Eplear, exaggeration, it remains a worthy subject for study, and the best clues we have as to how the first year of the First Era played out.*

After many years of the hunt-against-wise-foes Eplear of the Camorans was supreme among the Boiche. Every tribe and clan had promised itself to Eplear and the green-sap by Eplear’s words or his thousand arrows and blades

There he stood, and Falinesti graht-oak, most favoured among most favoured green-sap also, rose to walk Eplear king-of-all through the forest. A thousand thousand Boiche followed in the great graht-oak’s wake and the Valenwood sang to see them run through it, as sap through a tree. 

Great Falinesti came to rest at last

The greatest graht-oak stretched and sang and grew a new shape, living wood vibrant in honour of the king-of-all. Eplear sat and his people bowed. Every tribe of the Boiche came to lay gifts before Eplear Camoran, gifts for all the Bosmer.

 Abragoth of the Kahnik gave the head of Great-Gold-Ape-King, and Eplear ate his face that his skull would be a helm for a king.

Wendilac of the Parikh gave a hundred hundred pearls from the Blue Divide

Boleron of the Andrulo gave the hide of a terrible time-lizard

Hormilrimor of the Guleld gave a feather

Ungalithor of the Liilgur Matilion gave himself to guard the king-of-all with every day

Silvenar of the Edinil gave his everything-that-is to Eplear to give to all the Boiche to speak.

Oolathar of the Oolathar gave a million arrows of every make for Eplear to shoot a million things.

Kidragon of the Tithihk gave all the colours

Yuuligon of the Calobar gave a great dead bug.

Fogorth of the Jalkin gave a hundred vessels of honey that was sweet and good and fit for the king-of-all.

And many other tribes gave many other gifts

The giants gave Eplear a city of Haven. They walked in the sea and made great buildings of stone they fetched

The bird-men of the rivers gave Eplear five-and-twenty tongues of their own

The satyrs of the woods gave a secret

The centaurs gave Eplear an idea that many things would happen and one day men would rule.

Kulathuah the Keptu gave much tree-flesh that Eplear knew was useful to the clever men.

Juuk the Kothri gave ten strange beasts from far away.

Hadhuul the king of elves-elsewhere gave a handful of magic

And many other peoples gave many other gifts, who were all wise and holy Boiche who knew many things, and knew what Y’ffre wanted almost as well as Eplear Camoran. They climbed to the highest branches with Eplear and placed the golden skull of the Great-Gold-Ape-King on his head and called him king with a song. All the Boiche sang and the forest sang with them, and Jone and Jode smiled to hear such a beautiful song of the green-sap, and listened as they sang for a whole turn.

When the song was done, and loosed it so far and so fast and so strongly that the bow shattered into dust, and the arrow flew higher than Jone and Jode. Eplear never missed, and when some time was passed, the sky grew darker, and the Great-Roc-of-the-Hunt fell from the sky to land at the feet of Green-Sap-Walking. Eplear Camoran ate its great elf heart, and much more besides, until only a great long bone was left

After many hours of feasting, and many hours of lovemaking, Eplear was king-of-all in Valenwood, Elf-King Camoran beloved by all and all knew. Eplear told the Boiche that Y’ffre smiled on all of them, and Eplear knew no falsehood, and he was right. ",,,Mages,

And who is our guide on our journey? No one. Not Azura, his heart under flame, his blood under ground, his soul in an old hall and his nature in a bearded voice-murderer; such as his downfall will be their downfall. The Old Fools of Alinor had a leader too, whom harmed himself and cried foul for his own foolishness and as such the Old Fools blame their elders mistakes for they are too blind to see how to move on, as their leader never taught them how. 



Those who do not lead their own lives will perish, we are shown a path and choose to walk it. None tell us how to live our lives, for if we did we would have failed the test. We follow the beliefs that are proven correct, we live because we have the will to do so. Another could not question this philosophy if we have already killed them. This is why the wise follow Boethiah's path laid to us, for Boethiah knew the death of the Doom Drum and Time-Bird would come and knows their people will follow suit where Boethiah remains glorious, strong and unharmed and wishes the same onto us.



Home is not what we call out and say is ours, they serve as yet further testing of our worth. But this does not mean that the more one kills of them the greater he is, that's a philosophy for the thick-headed northerners. But their desire to make their what is in their way theirs is, whilst savage, honourable.



Auri-El is perhaps the worst liar of all



Now are the days of testing, for though his ideals were noble, his actions foolish and he received the death he deserved. But for us, we reserve a prayer for the inevitable:

1361472325.0,18yvbi,A Treatise on the Medieval Stasis of Tamriel,AlexisDeTocqueville,37,10,12,"**Introduction**

One of the more puzzling things about Tamriel from an economic and historical perspective

**Part the First

Before explaining what sorts of things could explain this growth stall, seems to meet most of the advantages that Europe and Asia had according to something like the ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" theory of growth. Essentially, the climate, flora, and fauna of Tamriel seem adequate. This is unsurprising given the tendency of fantasy universes to appear similar to medieval Europe. 

Additionally, though). I am of the opinion that in addition to necessary conditions of natural resources, there is an important sufficient condition, which is that people are permitted to make a living in the manner they choose. There is actually a quite high degree of personal freedom in most of Tamriel, or at least it's free enough for most people. 

What helped Europe emerge and kick off things such as the Industrial Revolution and Age of Enlightenment was a respect for the right of people to engage in scientific pursuit. Beyond that though

**Part the Second

Given that the political and academic freedoms necessary to enter into more advanced economic stages exist

Well

Yet, in universe application of magic. It's as if we believe that studying electricity would not lead us to create and manufacture light bulbs. Rather, what we see repeatedly is that mages are more concerned with gaining knowledge than actually using it to improve anyone else's lives. And I don't mean that altruistically, I mean that commercially. There is a huge opportunity for profit by simply discovering and manufacturing devices for the common people of Tamriel. 

*So where I place the blame for much of the stasis is not broadly on the existence of magic

**Part the Third

Some may be skeptical that magic could have much technological use, which is an explanation for why their animunculi typically have soul gems in them (I fear I am straying too far from the bounds of what I actually know).

Regardless, rather they focus more on the study of the magic itself.

**Part the Fourth

As loose as I have been in providing descriptions of Tamriel

A consistent theme seems to plague the more inquisitive minds of Tamriel. They study either history or magic, and thus poses little threat to breaking Tamriel's Medieval Stasis. Now, not all mages are academics. Quite a few seem to study magic for the sake of the power it gives to them. There are many megalomaniacs that study magic for the goal of destroying or controlling others. In contrast, there are many college mages who seem to study for the sake of knowledge.

It is this allure of pure knowledge which I suppose is the most damaging to Tamriel's development. There is little desire to practically improve Tamriel because of it. When any decent intellect in Tamriel either chooses history or the study of a discipline which seems dedicated to pure knowledge

Again

* The Mage gains some knowledge
* The Mage learns of some possible implication of that knowledge
* The Mage searches for more
* The Mage either dies, or nearly killed and frightened from doing any more research
* Regardless

I am sadly but an amateur

For those unfamiliar with that name, and they developed a telepathic bond. Realizing this, they made efforts to explore Oblivion, where Zenas would travel the various planes and Hidja would record his observations.

Zenas successfully traverses through five planes (Ashpit, Quagmire, and Apocrypha). He is trapped, however in the last he visits: Apocrypha. There, Zenas becomes obsessed with the knowledge contained within. It is perhaps the most pure example of the failures of Tamrielic academia.

**Part the Fifth

This section will admittedly be the most speculative

As written above

I believe the answer to that question is apparent given Morian Zenas's tale: it is Hermaeus Mora. Who else but the Master of Apocrypha would  repeatedly seduce mortals with the promise of knowledge

Hermaeus Mora, is in a unique position to know about technology and magic. It is the temptations that Hermaeus Mora oversees which repeatedly plagues those in Tamriel who should be advancing and applying technology. 

As described in the [*Imperial Census of Daedra Lords*](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/imperial-census-daedra-lords)
&gt;""Hermaeus Mora, born of thrown-away ideas used during the creation of mortality in the Mundus. Imperial Mananauts have verified that his influence on fate and time is real and unfeigned...""

I believe that Hermaeus Mora exerts an influence on Tamriel's mages writ large. Whether this influence is merely is in keeping with his nature, Septimus Signus, believes that he has found a puzzle box that contains the very heart of Lorkhan. Yet, it turns out that the box contains the *Oghma Infinium* (did Mora move the heart of Lorkhan, or was it never in the box). Furthermore, there is another apparent association with the Dwemer due to the appearance of a Black Book in the Dwemer city of Nchardak. 

The most technologically advanced race known to grace Tamriel has disappeared, I'm curious if there is ay significance to which Black Book the Dwemer had) appearing in Nchardak is no accident either, the chamber it is found in appears specially designed for holding it. 

The point is

**Conclusion**

There is no reason from a resource endowment, I place blame on the failure of the scholars and mages of Tamriel to take advantage of a useful source of energy and a lack of vision or desire for practical applications. I further theorize that Hermaeus Mora is strongly impacting the behavior of academics in Tamriel.

**Addendum The First

As pointed out by Mr_Flippers

Now, it seems that the rule of law is quite healthy throughout much of Tamriel. 

Yes

It is also true that human economic development has been grindingly slow for the most part. However, and more importantly, what gets it into the hands of the common people?

_______________________________________________________________

[The second page of the Mysterium Xarxes](http://images.uesp.net/6/69/Mysterium_Xarxes_P2.jpg) seems to differentiate itself rom the previous page. Tremble from the last statement seems to be the final statement so for now

*Come slow and bring four kes*

Now, would be that kes means Keys since Yahkem is commonly omitted. Four keys are required, but for what? To reach Camoran's Paradise, to summon Dagon? What are the four keys? The tribunal's four corners of the house of troubles, which Dagon is a part of? Dagon's four artifacts (his razor, the daedric crescent, the Mysterium Xarxes, one does require all four commentaries in order to be a part of Dagon's cult

There are four different bodies of text all staritng out wit a certain number. On the left below the first statement

*Mother | in m(y) first arm a storm*

We now move on to the second numbered statement on the upper right hand side of the page:

*M(y)-sec-ond-the-rus-h_-of-pla-gue-d_rai-n_*

Which translates to ""my second the

*the third all the tinder of anu*

The final numbered statement located adjacent to the third:

*the fourth the ver_ e_es of padhome*

All these seen to suggests what powers are held within Dagon's hands. The first arm (his upper right hand) holds a great storm of destruction. His second arm (upper left) holds a rain of plagues. Most likely the rain from the storm. The third arm (lower right hand) holds the tinder of Anu. Anu, since Nirn was on the brink of it when I first was born. The final statement could be translated as ""the fourth the very eyes of Padhome"". Padhome is another name for Padomay. Padomey's eyes lusted for the beauty of Nir. This brought Padomey to strike down Nir and cause the first act of destruction. The last two hands of Dagon seem to suggest that he believes he is the beginning, the being, and the cause of all destruction and change. These four arms may also be a reference to the four keys mentioned before...*hand* ^^^forgive ^^^my ^^^childish ^^^behavior .

Around the triangle holds different tid bits of titles and objects. From top going clockwise:

*to, master-is-master*

Only noticeable thing here is something akin to miasma (nasty smell) and master is master.

The final statement at the very bottom states:

*Be winnowed the timid shall be ble_ at m(y) feet and pra(y) pardon*

The statement suggests that the followers of Dagon will be winnowed from the timid

To finish of, and all the works. What does this mean? It means that Mancar Camoran wasn't all that powerful, nor was the actual book. Camoran, during his escape from the blades, most likely summoned Dagon and performed a ritual in order to gain access or paradise. The book is only powerful in the sense that it will help summon Mehrunes Dagon for you. Hopefully we can shed some light on the situation at hand with the power of the Mysterium Xarxes and the Mancar Camoran. You may now conjure your daedra to help bring light to this. Anhaedra may be allowed to enter now as long as his temper is kept in check.

But as all creation has its roots in the actions of Anu and Padomay these echos could find embodiment in entire cultures, with factions representing the conflicting concepts as they contend against each other. The battle between the Dwemer and the Chimer at Red Mountain, it could be argued, is an example of Anuic and Padomaic races retracing the steps of the very beginning.

The Dwemer represent Anu in their beliefs, fully devoting themselves to the various fluid and changing Daedra, and their philosophy embracing contradictions and disorder. Their most highly revered Daedra, Boethiah, Mephala, and Azura, all revolve around upheaval, and change. When the Chimer gained the power of a God

 So when the Chimer met the Dwemer at Red Mountain, against the wild unpredictability of both the Chimer’s Daedra and their new ideas of divinity. The result of this contest of faiths mirrored Anu removing itself and Padomay from time, as the Battle of Red Mountain led to the elimination of both the Dwemer and Chimer (the Dwemer with their disappearance, and the Chimer in their becoming the Dunmer).

Now to examine the Dwemer as representations of Anu can give us insight into the event of their disappearance. If we except that Dwemer value order and stasis, the Numidium serving as the eternal standing representation of order. This theory is not without flaws, as obviously the Numidium did not remain a static symbol, but was traded and used by various peoples, something the Dwemer would of anticipated. 

Instead lets turn our discussion to another popular opinion of the Dwemer’s fate, but it seems that if their goal was truly stasis then their ceasing to be was really a success. Removing themselves from existence separated the Dwemer from all change, the most static state they could ever hope to reach. This could be the only real desirable end for the Dwemer, as they never would of hoped to reach Aetherius or Oblivion (home of Gods which they don’t worship), and a death when not committed to a deity would just lead to reincarnation back into the muddled irregular world of Mundus. When faced with the inconsistent and fluctuating nature of reality the Dwemer might have come to the conclusion that the logical course of action was to do as Anu did, and step out of being.",,,Winterhold,

A TREATISE ON THE CURRENT STATE OF AFFAIRS OF THE DISPERSED TALOS CULT 

- Written by Codus Arconius, Thalmor Justiciar. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Talos Cult has always been the bastard sibling of the Imperial Cult of the Eight Divines. Even when Talos worship was **mistakenly** legal within the Empire

Because of their main goal of placing a strong man on the throne of the Empire the Talos Cult took part in many assassination attempts and political coups. The Cult famously took the side of the Wolf Queen Potema during the War of the Red Diamond and were also behind assassination attempts on the Dunmer Empress Katariah Ra'Athim and her delirious husband Emperor Pelagius the Third. The last famous assassination attempt by the Talos Cult was on the Emperor Uriel Septim VII which was uncovered and stopped by an Imperial Knight.

After the successful assassination of Uriel the Seventh by the Mythic Dawn and the resulting fall of the Septim Dynasty caused by the Oblivion Crisis, shouldn't rule the Empire of Man. ~~According to some sources, the Talos Cult aided the [**Withdrawn**] in the Assassination of Ocato~~ (**You should re-evaluate your sources, Codus - Seradar**). After the death of Ocato the Cult, as was mentioned earlier, were divided on whom should rule the Empire next. After much deliberation and arguing the Cult split into 2 with half supporting the Colovian Titus Mede and the other half support the Nibenese Eddar Olin. Ensuing Mede's victory over Olin and his taking of the Imperial City the Cult reformed under Mede's banner. 

The Talos Cult was legalised once again by the victorious Titus Mede I for their support in him and under his rule and Attrebus' the Cult slowly died since they no longer had a purpose. 

We now fast-forward to the year 175 of the Fourth Era and the signing of the **marvelous** White-Gold Concordat. After the signing of the Concordat the Cult's membership burgeoned to numbers higher than ever despite the Concordat forbiddening it. The multitude of members disappeared as fast as it grew however due to our friends within the Thalmor High Justiciary enforcing the Concordat (**Far better than the Septim's attempt at it** - S).

This then brings us to the Cult's current affairs. (**Finally** - S)

Due to the zeal and **rightful** perseverance of the Justicars in their enforcement of the WGC the Cult has diminished to only it's most extreme cultists. These Cultists are of the belief that only Talos is the only true divine and they see the Divines as contemptuous liars who've usurped the position of the dead Aedra. They see the 8 Divines as being the spirits that were created by early man and mer in place of the Aedra who died whilst creating Mundus. Here is an extract of their manifesto.

&gt; Greetings Novitiate.

&gt; Welcome to the path of the one true Divine. Whose name was scolded by the heretical Empire and their blasphemous overlords

&gt; Ignore the lies of the Imperial Cult and their Devil friends who continue to worship the names of the deceitful liars known as Akatosh, Zenithar, Mara, Stendarr, Kynareth and Julianos.

&gt; These Divines were created by our mistaken ancestors in reverence of the true Aedra who died in creating our home NIRN. The tricksters abused their delusioned worship and used it to fuel their ever-growing ego. 

&gt; I know

&gt; ""They are the lent bones of the Aedra, and not within. Like most things inexplicable, it is a circle. Circles are confused serpents, striking and striking and never given leave to bite. The Aedra would have you believe different, but they were givers before liars. Lies have turned them into biters. Their teeth are the proselytizers; to convert is to place oneself in the mouth of falsehood; even to propitiate is to be swallowed.""  Here Vivec shows us that the Divines are the deceptive remains of the Aedra, the Givers, 

&gt; Even the great Mages of Artaeum agree that the true Aedra are dead

&gt; ""The magical beings, became the et'Ada. The et'Ada are the things perceived and revered by the mortals as gods, spirits, or geniuses of Aurbis. Through their deaths, these magical beings separated themselves in nature from the other magical beings of the Unnatural realms.""

&gt; So there you have it

I hope this is good enough for you Ambassador [**Withdrawn**] and that you found it useful. As always it was a pleasure to work with you.

I've recently [created a new subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/tamrielscholarsguild/) for discussion of magic, and from the point of view of a scholar in Tamriel. What this means is that we don't know about any writings that have occurred outside of the Elder Scrolls games (and that book about Umbriel), meaning no MK or otherwise. While here in the real world, we can find out exactly what it is that heroes in Tamriel's history have done, however people *in* Tamriel can only guess.

I guess what I'm trying to emphasize here, and your posts should reflect this.

You should have a character prepared to post here. Create any kind of character with whatever kind of history, who practises Thaumaturgy, alchemy, and can obviously cast basic spells from other schools. He was born and raised in Camlorn, and discovered his passion for travel and adventure when travelling to Daggerfall for the first time to purchase bloodgrass for a particularly strong chameleon potion.

The theory is that there are 8 towers with 8 corresponding stones built from the energy of Aetherius (The plane where the souls of mortals go after they die

The known towers are:

1) **[Dirreni Tower](http://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Direnni_Tower)**

2) **[White Gold Tower](http://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:White_Gold_Tower)**, which was destroyed in TES4: Oblivion. The elves who built this tower later became known as Ayleids.

3) **[Red Mountain](http://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Red_Mountain)**, which was also destroyed in TES3: Morrowind. Red Mountain is an active volcano, and the Dwemer built the ruins around the mountain.

4) **[Numidium](http://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Numidium)**

5) **[The Crystal Tower](http://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Crystal_Tower)**

7) **Green-Sap**

8) **Orichalc**

What does any of this have to do with the TES games' storylines, a stone has been destroyed at the climax of every game! This could mean the barriers between Mundus and Oblivion are breaking down due to the protagonists of each TES game, and it also sets the stage for a main antagonist in the series, one who has been powerful enough to catalyze the events in Daggerfall, Morrowind, Oblivion, and Skyrim.

**TL;DR: There are 8 towers with corresponding stones which hold the barriers between Tamriel and Oblivion in tact. These stones are gradually being destroyed in every TES game.**

As with last week, lower than our averages around the time after the 1 year anniversary but certainly a good amount of fresh new scholars. Discussion and threads this week were mostly dominated with Q&amp;A threads though we did see some other activity with more lengthy threads such as [The Mabrigash] by AzraelDomonov, a very worthwhile read if I might add.

In other news, all to the background of exorbitantly soothing Elder Scrolls music. I very much advise those who have not listened to Elder Lore to do so, even if it is for a few episodes (I personally suggest Seasons 1 + 2, but the rest are great, too).

Other than that there are not too many announcements from the mods. On a downside this week we did have to remove a very unhealthy amount of comments this week, so the only thing we can do is to remind you all to reread the sidebar. That would be much appreciated.

Could it be the Silvenar

Could it be the Camorans? I think I remember another tower has a bloodline as a stone (but I can't think which) so maybe also a little unoriginal. Also

Maybe it could be the Green Pact? Y'ffre is known as the first earthbone, deactivating the tower, which has probably been done (since Falinesti has rooted) would mean breaking the Green Pact totally, which thematically is a little too like the Talos ban, and also would probably be known about.

Holding his axe aloft

Of course, and struggled to stand. The Nord smacked himself on the head, for he'd forgotten to never taunt a downed dragon. However, his helm had flown off while he flew away from the dragon, and so he hit himself quite hard with a steel-gloved hand. Dazed, he focused on the dragon in the middle, and made ready.

They thoomed at the same time

""YOU STUPID LITTLE *JOOR*

The man got up slowly, still dazed from his own stupidity.

The dragon snapped his great jaws, you fool! Now I'm stuck here forever - with you!""

""Stuck...where?"" the man replied. His eyes could see nothing besides the dragon. All else was void.

""Out. Out of Time."" the dragon replied testily. ""We're out of time

This of course made no sense, to end what he knew must be some trickery, but found himself unable to move towards it. He tried again, to no avail.

""What the hell did you do to me?"" he growled

""I? What did *I* do you *you*?""

""What are you saying?""

""Are you really that dense, forever, because you're an idiot.""

The Nord scratched his head

When at least he could hear again

The dragon glared at him. ""'Wait'? You're serious?""

The Nord nodded his head

""I don't think you quite understand

.

A few millennia went by in the Aurbis, beast?""

The dragon blinked, alright?""

The Nord agreed, and began its tale.

""Long ago, and more powerful besides. We ruled those mountains before your kind rebelled, and afterwards, we held them as one of our places of... I suppose it is said, in your tongue, ""last refuge"". When the Great Break came, we all endured it as best we could. It was the worst, it was the worst feeling ever, come here!' And I did.

'Yes, otherwise they would have fixed *Bormahu* by now. Go see what's taking them so long.' I leapt up and flew away to find the Menders.

I see the curiosity in in your ugly little face, they come to him and nurse him back to sanity. In your tongue, I have heard them called 'jills', or something like that.

Anyway, and the Princes on their islands parted their armies to let me pass, for they too were sick and tired of this stupid Break. I flew through the big hole in the waters, and out into the Magic Realm. The guardians let me pass, and they looked worried, so I hurried, and flew without rest onwards.

Eventually I reached the Rim, dancing and chanting in the same tongue you're singing in. I yelled at them to get out of the way, but they didn't respond, so I bit one.

He yelped and jumped and I was thrown out into the Void as his foot struck me.

So

'Mothers, and's not gotten better! I will show you the way to him!'

For what seemed like an eternity, the Menders. Far more lovely and graceful than any of my kin you've seen, human, I guarantee you that. I showed them how to bite again, and they bit every dancer on the Rim. 

As we flew back through the Rim to find *Bormahu*, healed his broken mind. And he said 'Ho ha ho, what has been happening?! How long have I lain mad?! I feel completely different!'

And his face was blurred

And that's my story.""

The Nord stopped singing at the abrupt end. ""Wait

The dragon snorted. ""Is that important? No. Besides

""And what was that?"" the Nord asked.

The dragon grinned a toothy grin. ""I got you to sing the Menders here. They haven't had a meal in ages

And the Nord looked, for the swiftest of the jills gobbled him up in one bite.

She spoke to the dragon floating in the void, for this tasty morsel. Now wing your way home again. Make the story a bit shorter next time, for you're not good at telling them.""",,False,,t5_2t5ay,,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1797ch/the_bite_of_the_menders/

Let me begin by saying congratulations to the subreddit and the scholars for reaching 7000 scholars. Not only have we gone from 6000 to 7000 in a single month, Holy Shit, guys. Welcome, new scholars, I now know there are lots of you.

In times like these I do feel as though I need to reintroduce what these threads are for all the new people. The Weekly Community Thread is the only place on /r/teslore where all kinds of discussion are encouraged, talk about the week, and introduce themselves if they are new.

----

Weekly Recap:

As I was saying this week has been very spectacularly active. I myself remember counting the number of threads per week a few weeks back and smiling at an amazing 24 threads. Well we just had 51 threads this week, all I can say is welcome new people, welcome to the subreddit.

Particularly this week most activity has been in the simple question department, not sure about you.

Before heading on to announcing Scholar of the Week I'd just like to use the fact we have so many new people over to give some guidelines for all the new people.

---

**Surviving in /r/teslore 101**

There is not much to explain beyond what is already written

If you are new, you should take a look at:

1. The Subreddit rules and guidelines in the sidebar right over there ---&gt;

2. [The New Scholar's Guide to the Subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/wiki/newscholarsguide)

3. [The FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/wiki/faq)

4. [Listen to at-least 10 episodes of the Elder Lore podcast if not more. Doing this is the most effective and basic way to start becoming a knowledgeable scholar. If you have a short attention span and are not willing to listen to all the episodes

If you take the time to do these 4 things you will find yourself suddenly being a much better scholar and you will be able to understand all the complex mumbo-jumbo that most new scholars do not understand.

----

That is all I have for the weekly recap

**Scholar of the Week**

Despite having to remove an unhealthy amount of comments from this user due to lore irrelevancy, Mr_Flippers, for your great activity this week, hope we can see more continued activity from you in the future.

That is all for this week

I, and the rest of the community

But just as we lose some scholars, once again I'd like to remind you to read the sidebar and go through the links at the top.  

The community is always steadily growing, so *please* give any feedback you might have about what you think would be fun doing for the occasion.

Talking of anniversaries, and it is also true that much of the games' fanbase may be a little dumb, but overall the game has greatly influenced lore and lore communities. In my personal experience with the game, I started out with no previous knowledge of the universe and a very straightforward approach to the game. My first character was, quite obviously, an Argonian, as I thought they looked cool. I started playing, but as I progressed slowly through the main quest I found myself much more enthralled by learning about the world and communicating with it than slaying dragons or assassinating people. As with any chain reaction, for the work you put into the game. Sadly it was my first tes game

I'd love if you guys shared your skyrim experiences. What were your first impressions of the game?

Honestly it is hard to keep track of the sheer amount of activity he's got in the subreddit due to both the fact that he posts pretty much everywhere, *b-rad-oleary*, for your continuous activity and enthusiasm in the subreddit.

So

* Introduce yourself if you are new
* Tell me about your week
* Give us feedback on anything.

Alessia here is the wife of Auri-El and Shor, where she has symbols of both Aka (the Dragonfires) and Lorkhan (The wound on her chest) along with a symbol of their unity (the CHIM-EL ADABAL)

Alesia was playing the role of Auri-El

**Electing a new Moderator

---

With our community growing as steadily as it is, you'll need to be willing and able to:

* Review thread content for quality and appropriateness and take action if necessary

* Browse thread comments to remove spam and irrelevant content

* Be active enough to respond to mod mail and discussion soon enough that it isn't an inconvenience (this doesn't go without saying

You only really need to be online every two days or so to be active enough

If you feel that you fulfill these requirements and would like to take the position, mind you, but it means we have a better feel for what you're about and we'll be more sure that you're prepared to devote some effort to /r/teslore. Everyone who raises their hand will be reviewed, of course, we won't simply dismiss people.

**Do not nominate other people. If you see someone that wants to be a moderator and you agree that they should be

Please share your opinion on this topic. It is very important to get the opinion of as many scholars as possible so we could satisfy as many scholars as possible.

Anyway (Xeno again, thank you everybody for posting and commenting. This may be a special community thread but the normal guidelines don't change much. *Please* do tell me about your week if you wish, and introduce yourself if you are either new or not particularly new and have just been lurking this entire time. 

Also

If you do not get the position have the respect and sportsmanship not to complain nor act jealously at the scholar who did get the position. This is an important event but not quite important that you should be pissed if it does not turn out the way you wanted it too.

4) We've seen that dragons, or along those lines, and it works. Also Alduin was defeated once using Time, which is both his strength and weakness. Expound?

5) I'm sure I'm missing lots of dragon-lore and don't know enough to ask to learn what I don't know. If you could

We know that when the moons reappear

My question is this; the Khajiit race depends heavily on moon phases to designate the birth/morphology of their progeny. When both moons cannot be seen it means that Khajiit birth 'Suthay' offspring

But it makes me wonder

But in this instance of 2 years it is reported that the moons physically vanished from the night sky. This isn't a natural moon phase so what would happen? Would they have birthed a new breed of Khajiit in this time? What would have changed? Are there any reports that signify any new types of Khajiit?

A personal theory of mine regarding the disappearance of the moons is that the same form of magic used to make Artaeum vanish for hundreds of years was used in some way this time round. Purely conjecture though.

I can see it happening one of three ways. I will use the start of the 4th era as an example.


* 1. Mehrunes Dagon is banished

To me this seems unlikely

* 2.  Mehrunes Dagon is banished, years possibly pass. The events that passed are reflected on and it is decided that this event changed Tamriel so drastically that a new era should be begin in wake these events. A message is sent out saying that in wake of these events one month from now the 4th era shall begin 4E 0. 

This seems the most logical but does not hold true to the lore when it comes to written dates etc. Unless over the years the dates were miscommunicated and the date of the end of the oblivion crisis is not truly known.

* 3. Similar to number 2 the events pass and the decision is made after things have calmed down. But the decision is made to back date the start of the new era to ending of the oblivion crisis and a message is send out stating

This is my personal favourite and I would think it to be the most likely.

Mighty fine week if I may say so myself. We got pretty stocked on activity both in the Q&amp;A department and others, with 172 new scholars this week. It looks to me like these new scholars are being welcomed pretty well, so good job guys. I am also pleased to announce us moderators weren't forced to be too trigger happy with our remove and ban tools when compared to last few series of weeks, so good job on that account, too.

No big threads to specifically mention or anything too exciting part for the Moderator Elections

Chapter 1: Divination of In-Geniused Gametopraxis Facilities:
 
When scouting for potential facilities, which plays a major role in the production of pistics. Ritual gametopraxis is a long, winding path along which lies inspiration, evangelism, interlocution and eventual illumination is a deeply personal catabasic dream journey throughout the Argonian Ummah - both veiled within metaphor and exemplified in living aedifice.

The first sign you have reached your destination will be the underspirit murmurs of the Hist patricians in your apotrope

The bravest of the Saxheel have attempted to interlocute sub-marine-asana, leading to a number of misapprehensions in other creeds - yet as can be seen in what follows, this superficiality is, by essence, paradox in paraprax.
 
 
Chapter 2: Argonian  Phyle-Ontology:

Argonian Tribal Law recognizes 11 distinct phyles. 3 tepoztopilliite, and 2 intermezzo.  

Mantis tepoztopillis are dedicated proselytisers. Acro-bathyc, they are expected to dedicate themselves to the art of evangelization, devoting  their primary, secondary, and tertiary apotropes, outside of ritual combats, utterly to prosecuting the Hist faith into the unillumined. Past their prime, ecclesiate

Phylake tepoztopillis are warriors. Possessed of robust musculature and thrice-layered scales

Candle tepoztopillis  act as reserves. Diminutive in stature and intellect, with a sheath of protective smf, or ‘godwax.’

Chapter 4: Establishment of Counter-Point:

Argonians inspire potential counter-points with the use of their vibrant iconology. The inspiration to apistics may not be obvious at first; this is because the auspicious derms vesting inspirational yonics are not visible to anyone not granted the b’r’ghayglys or “ true sight""  by way of euhist communion.
 
 Root-faithful keep their phylacteries obscured inside their forms so it can be hard to know if one is a tepoztopilliite, nor do the Hist expressly interdict., as divination of the opposing phyle is required only when proselytism is the goal.
 
For most tepoztopilli Argonians, most commonly bright, fierce shades that draw the eye and, perhaps, inspire a counter-point.
 
 On the contrary, in fact, quiescent orbophylacteries, and are not generally viewed as inspirational within the Argonian faith (outside of a few unnoteworthy schisms).

Specifics of the Argonian gametopraxis ritual are often influenced by the customs local to the Argonian's habitation which can lead to some drastic variations.  For example: in the Cyrodiilic systems, Argonians from such orders may prefer to eschew this form of communication  in the interest of avoiding unbecoming inspirational hysterics.  As a result, it is often customary for Argonians to make a pilgrimage back to The Ummah  before they find a counter-point.
 
Chapter 5: Techne for Inspiration:

The process of interlocution  can vary a great deal depending on the distance from The Ummah, which is much less dangerous for the tepoztopilli. Further from The Ummah, interlocution resembles apistic ritual, with some key differences.

For one

When the apotropeia of the tepoztopilli is fully revealed, the surrounding vestments will not have receded past the point of danger. Much like underwater interlocution, this can be quite dangerous. A discommuned Argonian is quickly disposed of by way of special judgement and secret justice, making successful interlocution a life or death endeavor.

When evangelization  is complete
 
All rites of interlocution are observed by and approbated by the arboreal will of the Hist, even enlightenment.
 
Chapter 6: Maltransmission of Root Heresy:

The Root Heresy itself is an enigma thought to be stellar myth outside of  The Ummah, when not kept in check its reality cannot be denied. As was seen be seen in the bioclasm of the original Hist homeworld of [untranslatable], which after the outbreak of 1E 668 was quarantined by order of the Dendrite Assembly outside the bounds of the known rhizomes,  accessible now only through the samadhi organelle of the raining [sic] Tulkutree.
 
In aedifice, though popular doxa holds that they are the result of apistic devilry. While so near the surface, the Root Heresy may be easily dispatched by quick exorcism, yet once it has reached the root echelon it may enter chrysalic cloister and hatch into a heresiarch, a dual-headed parasite capable of infecting the entire rhizome with twice-spoken dogmas. At this point the Root Heresy is able by impunity to reach critical blaspheme and burst forth  n violent sect schism to threaten the whole of the Ecumene and greater still.

This bale entity - which is often compared to the Sat-k.l of the Red-Guardsman Guilds or the Old-One of the Atmor system -  is the eschaton phase of Root Heresy

Avoidance of this eschatological disease can be achieved only through proper rites
 
Chapter 7: Apotropaeic Guerilla Warfare:

During the Lunar bacchanal of Ssang-Wei, and candle-tepoztopillis of all tribes gather at the Hippo Campus for deep-Hist war games to garner and test their faith. Zealots will slather their apotropes with copious amounts of euhist, ensuring thunderous inspiration, thereafter retiring to their battlenests for an excitable fortnight of nocturnal rear-sorties and pullout feints.

At the end of the contest, console the inferior tribes by throat-singing the virtues of their apotropes.

Yonics also participate in duels
 
Chapter 8: Xeno-Evangelism:

The popular notion amongst the apistics of the Ecumene that Argonian xeno-evangelism is a simple matter, this author can confirm, resolutely, miserably false.
 
 In perfect, deprived of the grace of the euhist by necessity (for the Hist do not approve their murmurs taken abroad) illumines a quantum foam of outcomes-like-bubbles, at once here, now flitting there, and back again on the whim of the breeze: the novitiate maybe  fully root-faithed, fully apistic, or a chimerical mass of  hurdygurdy inbetween horror.  The communicants could become entangled in patristic paradox, or even negating them in favor of Boiche-type formal apostasy. In some rare circumstances that defy letters
 
For this reason the practice is carried out with - even amongst the most overzealous - with the utmost caution and heavy investment in contracommunicative wards.

However, incapable of mutual illumination.
 
If, after matters are concluded the diplomats would forgo such apistic barbarities as hand-shaking in favor of a more cloistered farewell. The victors and victrices of the most recent Ssang-Wei are summoned to meet the ambassador, who then selects interlocuters according to the demands of his native gospel.
 
If the chosen is yonic, which causes the sacred ichor to leak out.
 
However, and the couple move onto the next steps of the ritual. Both parties first stand upright, the Argonian remaining completely still whilst the Tsaesci wraps his or her extremely flexible lower vestments around the Argonian. From there on the practice is incredibly similar to ordinary interlocution, except that the Argonian takes a completely tacit role whilst the Tsaesci controls the syllogistic interface of the communication. After the ritual the Tsaesci is offered a cup of Argonian sacred ichor - theatrical symbolysis of living sacrifice,  alluding to some guignol event in unwritten parahistories unknown  to softer-skinned apistics, or so this one is told.


Final Word:
 
It is this author's gilded well-intention that this guide will  serve to dispel the many common misapprehensions among the softer dermed creeds of the Ecumene . Histtheology can be quite fascinating,  lead to improved understanding and respect between all observable faiths.

 ""Hey! You! You're finally awake. You were trying to cross the border

Is the crossing of a border inherently a crime

I know, would a run-of-the-mill citizen/merchant/mercenary be able to travel from Cyrodiil to Skyrim without official permission? If closed-border/controlled-border policies _were_ in place, were they limited to provinces experiencing martial law (re: obvious Civil War), or were they constant?

Lastly- is border policy declared centrally by the Emperor/bureaucracy

Sorry for the fragmentation of my question. Thank you for your time.

**Weekly Overview**

This week was quite interesting. Weirdly it did not follow with the rest of the latest weeks, [An Inspired Account of the Dawn Era v.1 – by Psyijic Empocarius – 4E 97 By Empocariam](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1a2an2/an_inspired_account_of_the_dawn_era_v1_by_psyijic/), [On the marriage practices of Morrowind, and some notes on the institution of slavery in Morrowind by FrankManic](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/19smmy/on_the_marriage_practices_of_morrowind_and_some/) and [Burial Customs of the 10 Races, Part 1 by Anhrl](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/19nyhj/burial_customs_of_the_10_races_part_1/). Just as weirdly it seems the rate of newcomers is starting to slow down, with 197 new subscribers this week. Nevertheless there are many newcomers, so I'd like to just formally welcome all you new scholars again to our not-so-humble little subreddit. Hopefully you all did a good job looking through the sidebar and its links

That's it for this week, guys, and welcome again to all the new scholars. Do continue posting and commenting, and have a great week!

**KAH JOOR RIIK**

Tidings and hale health, Headcleverman of the Winter's Hold Forthrow.

I am sending word today of our team's headway; but first, for the doomworthing siger over the Southrons at Fall Kreath. I and my team passed the honey-horn trind the workhall when the goody news reached us. The Sjardalls ought to know better than to make war on their own warlearners, and by your might they must be surely learned to smarting.

Unhappily however, brainaddling ghostwonder shaking off all offwilled weirds.

But thware me to unriddle

Now to startings: As Your Wyrmshipfulness must well ken, of the eight aldstuffs - Heaven, Fire, Loft, Water, Flesh, Wood, and Blome. Time was

Yet mine delvings at the Aldstuff Onquickeningstead- so givefully us afforded by your Lordship's open hand - wherewith edgesaid, ducks, bits of bark, and so to forever, has yielded up through forsoothily many and mighty sunderings one such suchness: the aldstuffs are deeply withput of stringlike Navelrigging taut like gleecraftish catguts, so that they ever quiver with one-only gleestaffs, mingling together where the rigs makes pitchclasping

Delving deeper inwise with rearding claps of my Might spoke thinner than a fly's pintlebone, an unsmotesome (though unreckonsome times I have fand) kernel of whetherfraught specks, Graymotes, about which a clove of douthsome fraught specks, Drightenmotes, ever hound in trindleringwise workpath a clove of nithingly fraught Elfinmotes.

Not-withstanding the seemly evenweight of fraughtships, slower than the drive of icklehead, though mayhaps it is quicker than witdrive. I cannot reckon surely. But thus is found on each end of the navelgrit, whenever one should bother to look, one douthsome, and one nithing fraught halfball. The douthsome halfball of one mote then hounds the nithing of another, which makes up the navelrigging. The nithing halfball's striving to flight makes the quavering drive-like-tides and one-only gleestaff

The unlikehood between aldstuffs is down to the bulkweight of navelgrits by motescoring. Heavenly grits have a score of each fraughtship, and whether; Firelike grits have twoscore of each fraughtship; Loftish have fourscore; Waterish and Fleshish ones have eightscore ; Woodish, ten-and-sixscore; Earthish, thirty-and-twoscore; and Blomish, mightily big, have sixty-and-fourscore. And yet they are still soothmightily small beyond wonder - like to dustmotes as dustmotes are to mountains. A thimblesworth of peat holds thrisands more Earthish grits than all the shores of Mhungard have grits of sand. Forsooth more so of their own inner motes, like dust motes to the world-whole.

Aldstuffs readily bind and sunder, and careful flowreckoning of weights: It takes six-and-almost-one-half-score of heavenly navelriggings to have mighty enough a drouthsome fraughtship to hound after a blomish strand. Though there are times when aldstuff navelrigs will bind in a way too pitchclashfully unbecoming, or even too pitchclaspingfully handsome, that they sunder uttermightily, and their sundering sunders their own inwise cloves, casting away Moterotten mists of freewandering drightenmotes and elfinmotes - ken far better to most lowfolk as clevercraft inworking.

Yet never does the unsmite sunder. As if shieldcladded like your Wyrmshipfulness against pithy Sjardally arrows and slings, nor sleightly, in all slightest.

Wherefore, Lordship, not I) that if one could sunder an unsmite, then surely the inwork cast off would outshine Magnar in the Welkyn. Hence our restless delvingship and clevercrafting of the unsmite weapon, the 'Horker's Teeth'.

Though a misworking clod bare worth its weight to weigh down leafs, as you ken full. I cannot trust its outdrafting to churlish speech. Kindly tread these bones with care, Great Wyrm, my reard is stronger than so lithe a half-elf yeoman as I should be thought to lundishly kit.

http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/170264/raid_on_pyandonea/)

Aside from that we've also had a lot of great discussion on the many different question threads. I personally very much enjoyed discussing my outrageous military theories with you guys this week

It'd also very good to see the new people fitting in so well. The lack of discrimination against new people and the welcoming discussion is a breath of fresh air

That's all for the weekly Overview

This week was undoubtedly one of the busiest weeks we've had in a while. I cannot reference any specific discussions or posts as being much greater than others, so thank you all for your contributions!

To add to that, we are a very small community, but it is those subreddits that draw their popularity from mildly entertaining content that you could scroll through or view for about three seconds. I do believe /r/teslore is different, our userbase is collectively intelligent and strongly connected, and the fact that there are so many of us grouped together is truly amazing. Of course, /r/teslore is also about influence. From the subreddit many other smaller subreddits were created, some of which are /r/falloutlore and /r/tamrielscholarsguild. It only saddens me that those subreddits are not as popular.

Anyway

* Introduce yourself if you are new
* Give us mods any feedback you might have.
* Ask any question you might have.
* Tell me about your week. I've had a particularly fun week

How much are we to count the world we encounter in the games and the design of the games and gameplay as ""lore""?  Is lore JUST books and basic plot of the game or does it extend beyond that?**

I've heard people complain about the ease of play in Oblivion and Skyrim vs. earlier games.  The chief complaint revolves around the ease of creating races/classes (as in very little thought has to be put into it intially).  I'll admit, I'd like to establish one a priori principle.  While it is likely that the change in magic usage is merely due to game mechanics and not an intentional lore sift by the creators, for the purposes of this discussion, I'm assuming that the shift reflects an actual reality in Nirn and not just the whims of game creators.  

A summary of magic (as I understand it) in previous games:

* In the earliest games, unless you trained and planned very carefully after that.
* At least in Morrowind (and, you did not regenerate magic.  You had to sleep, drink a potion or absorb to replenish your magic store.  (Presumably, this was also the case for health and stamina, but those aren't the topic at the moment.)  
* Both in Oblivion and in Skyrim, and can replenish at a lightning fast pace with the proper enchantments.  
* ALL races are able to use magic (albeit

WHAT HAPPENED

* **Genetics:** Mer are naturally more adept at magic than either men or beast-kin.  We know from the Bretons that intermixing with mer creates a people more adept at using magic as well.  Thus
* **Culture:** Historically, there wasn't a way for the intermixing of cultures.  In Oblivion, one of the things I didn't like was the homogeny of people and cultures in Cyrodiil.  Presumably, this is because, when people live together for an extended period of time, they become more and more similar.  As Oblivion was the first game where magic become, for the most part, this lends credence to the idea.  This further reinforces the ""Genetics"" theory as well.  Oblivion takes place at the end of the Septim dynasty
* **Absorption of Aetherius:** This is the most extreme of my theories.  IF Aetherius is the source of magic AND the sun is actually a hold to Aetherius formed by Magnus THEN we can assume that prolonged exposure to Aetherius might have some effect on the peoples of Nirn.  This effect could be one or both of the following: A) Increased ability to use magic by races which, sleeping or absorbing.  That means it's either being absorbed directly from Aetherius OR, more interestingly, people are generating it on their own.  

**ANOTHER EDIT:  One responder pointed out that it has been a relatively short amount of time between Morrowind and Skyrim.  Which reminded me I neglected one important point.  If the mixing of peoples in Cyrodiil contributed at all to the shift in the ability to use magic, after the Oblivion Crisis and the Great War, there would be a diaspora of sorts, sending people of every stripe scattering everywhere.**",,False,,1349646081.0,t3_113f81

I soon found, so it wasn't exactly easy on the eyes. There were people trying to jump awkwardly into the RP, and people taking the topic away to something else, so there was more than one conversation at once a lot of the time.

So, and I've named my adapted version ""The Trial at Hogithum Hall"". Has more of a ring to it than ""The Trial of Vivec"", I think.

Here's a summary of what I've done to the original:

* Only the dialogue of the characters were extracted

* Dialogue that I felt took away from the flow too much was taken out (stuff that doesn't wholly matter

* Characters that I felt that didn't add anything were taken out altogether. If something of worth was contributed by them

* Some dialogue has been moved around or broken to compensate for the quoting feature forums allow for. Unfortunately

* The four forum threads the RP was done in have been separated into ""acts"". No real reason for this, out-of-character narration has been incorporated into ""stage directions"", if you will.

* The grammar has been cleaned up

I do feel a little bad for changing some things, and I hope (should they stumble across this) that the participants would not be offended.

For those that don't know what the Trial of Vivec is, and at least five developers in total take part. For this reason, despite it being a roleplay involving many fans, many consider it to be canon.

Now, and it's at about 27000 words. That's like, almost half of a small novel. My browser struggles to look at it online, so you might have better luck downloading it (File &gt; Download as...).

Because of its size, I'll just say that I was thoroughly surprised by the depth of the full RP. There's a lot of lore discussion in there, there's tragedy, there's comedy, and there's even a bit of romance in there (cheeky Vehk). I recommend reading it.

Without further ado, it was certainly no small task it compiling it. Enjoy.

Those of you who recognize my name probably haven't seen me here in some time. As I said a few months ago, suitable for both beginners and advanced scholars.

I am currently on the history section

I am aware that there are several different theories concerning the events, depending on what we know.

1. The first and most-accepted theory is that Boethiah directly consumed Trinimac and Malacath was the result of that by the expected processes. This also changed the Aldmer with Trinimac into the Orsimer.

2. The second theory is that Boethiah murdered Trinimac and established Malacath, and Malacath forcibly took the Orsimer.

3. The third theory is that Trinimac and the western deity known as Ebonarm are the same

Everytime I'm in such a discussion
1. An artifact is infused with a fragment/blood of a daedric prince
2. An artifact has to be created by a daedra (my personal opinion)

Now let's take Goldbrand for example. In the Oblivion mainquest ""Blood of the Daedra"" (that title)

but if we look at the descripcion of Goldbrand in Yagrum Bagarn's Tamrielic Lore it says: 
This magical Sword is almost a complete mystery. Thieves tell tales about its golden make and how it was actually forged by ancient dragons of the North. Their tales claim that it was given to a great knight who was sworn to protect the dragons. The Sword lends its wielder the ability to do fire damage on an enemy. Goldbrand has not been sighted in recent history and is said to be awaiting a worthy hero.

as far as I understand it

so that means either:
1. Above theories are both wrong
2. The legend/Yagrum is wrong
3. Goldbrand on the list has somehow game mechanic reasons
or 
4. I don't know jack shit about daedric artifacts.

Anyone care to enlighten?

1361657319.0,193m32,Altmeris Language Construction,myrrlyn,30,4,18,"Following far behind in the footsteps of /u/lu_ming
____
### The language itself

I am basing this off of words we see in-universe and what just *feels* High Elven to me. It's not an exact science

W and Y make more frequent appearances than they do in English/Tamrielic, B, P, Z, and DJ are almost never found. Rather, Altmeris prefers flowing consonants and word structure. M, N, T, and H do not impede speech flow and are the most common consonants. Consonantal combinations are also extremely rare

An example word I created would be *Ahieryae*

### Linguistic structure

Languages follow their speakers. Altmer are very organized, and at the same time multi-faceted, artistic, and highly symbolized. This is reflected in the structure of their language and vocabulary. Words have many meanings, not all of which are synonymous, and require context to determine with precision what they are, but their sentences are arrayed consistently and clearly.

Word order for clauses follows these patterns:

* Independent clause-first dependent-second dependent-nth dependent

* accusative-dative-VERB-genitive-nominative.

* nominative-vocative

* modified-modifier

* ablative-phrase

In cases where multiple modifiers affect both a modified word AND each other, but later do not necessarily define earlier.

With the influx of Cyrodiilic languages, dependent clauses have become allowed to be placed in the primary clause, rather than attached at the end. In artistic script, the main clause remains unbroken and the dependents are attached at the word which they modify. With enough of these, flowery language ceases to be merely a metaphor.

### Formality

Altmeris is a first-child of the EHLNOFEX language, and are shorter words and have more vague or wandering meanings.

* AI: to be. AI encompasses all forms of the state of being. It is used for High formality, and such. Although it's High status means it should not be used in everyday conversation, I will use it as such to demonstrate. *AI MYRRLYNE* means I AM myrrlyn (the -e is vocative). *AI /R/TESLORE* means YOU ALL ARE /r/TESlore. *AI XENOPOSEIDON* is HE IS xenoposeidon. *AI /R/SHITTYTESLORE* is THEY AND SOME OF WE ARE /r/shittyteslore. I assume you see my meaning. It isn't just an identifier or a statement of being. It is related to the EHLNOFEX *AE*, a statement of absolute IS.

* AH-: AH- is the root of LOVE. It has many suffixes to relate to the many forms of LOVE. AHN is PASSION, for one may only betray those they love, and AHM is DEDICATION. The suffix -ë, the antonymic, may also be attached. AHNË is PASSIONATE HATRED. AHRË is DISGUST. AHMË is FIERCE OPPOSITION. Again, the Tamrielic ""translation"" is written in full capitalization to indicate that these are concepts, and far broader than our words can capture.

Altmeris also recognizes, for the Beginning is always important.

Low elevation words are longer, and have taken a few from the known body of language as well.

### Word Formation

Altmeris follows the Latin method of prefixing and suffixing roots to change their form

Personal pronouns: the simplest way to write them is (m,o)(e,o,n,s,l,e). In order,2,P),acc

### Vocabulary

In no particular order

* *amufi-*: Love (v). Notice that this is polysyllabic and sounds different from the High Elevation AH-, is a High Concept, and ideal in its form. *amufi-* is low, and mundane. It refers both to the emotion and to the action of love.

* *uliy-*: In Altmeris

* *amnuis-*: This is an adjective, close, beautiful (not a measure of physical attractiveness), elegant, flowing.

* *moeya*: This is an exception verb

* *alt-*: Most commonly taken to mean high, right (not as in right hand), and some more. The -ë suffix makes it deep, close, fatal, sundering, and such.

* *Orsi-*: As you well know, outcast, ostracized, alien-in-his-own-kind.

* *-mer*: This can be both a suffix or a standalone word, close-knit-group, gathering, band, kind, kin, those-in-common.

* *elweny-*: The Y is not a vowel. Vowel suffixes are appended to the root. The root is pronounced el-when and with a suffix -ae

### Pronunciation

Diphthongs are typically pronounced as individual letters, the softer is chosen. The only real rule of the language is that it must flow easily and articulately when spoken.

Welcome to yet another late Weekly Community Thread. I'm sure you guys are getting sick of waiting an extra day for these, and sometimes I am simply unable to provide a well thought out weekly review in time, something that has happened for example yesterday and is about to happen these next two weeks. I will say it now so that you fine folks wouldn't be surprised later on, I am about to go on a vocation for a duration of around 9 days during which the other moderators will try their hands at the community threads. 

Right, this week was certainly as bustling a week as any we have had lately, with lots of newcomers and lots of questions. I am very happy to announce that despite having certain off topic discussions that we sadly had to remove, it seems by general observation that all new newcomers are doing a pretty darn good job of keeping to the rules are reading the FAQ. Thank you all for that, it certainly made us mods happy.

**Weekly Overview**

Well, we have been pretty much overstocked with question threads this week, and have seen some great scholarly responses from all the discussing scholars. We also had a lot of newcomers this specific week, with 283 new subscribers this week.

So yes, keep at it.

It was... An interesting place, but still in a dream.

Aurorans standing vigil at every turn made the trip that much more enjoyable. I knew every moment that I was safe. Eventually

It was a massive, and from others more rainbows. In the center of the room was Meridia, in the form of a bright light. When she spoke, she spoke with a powerful, but benevolent tone, like a mother to a child who asked an innocent question. Her words were soothing, and all very informative.

""You wish to know, Defeater of Undeath, Light in the Darkness of Oblivion, and Once-Member of the Cohorts of Magnus. Ah... The last title has piqued your interest, hasn't it? Yes, it is true.

*Sotha Sil

am fully aware of my inability to fully comprehend his persona

general portrait of the man

information my sources have granted me.

One must first understand

bore a forlorn but resolute visage

to enter a place outside of time

seconds had passed. Take into account what that may do to someone

freedom to think with no distraction

one’s every wish. Nigh complete freedom. I believe Sotha Sil partook in this activity far more

than his companions

I also believe he achieved that state that brings one above the common ideals of reality

perhaps even further

speculation than anything

Sotha Sil was like we are

instructing them

more than any of us

the Sorcerer

weary of mortal imperfections,

and some say the very world

fully leave it all behind

mortal gods and that was the reason he retired to the Clockwork City. This world

world

forefathers and repeat them to no end. I understand words spoken by Almalexia are to be scrutinized

conscientiously

already purposed on murdering the Nerevarine and deceiving him to have a mind to murder the Tinkerer

even though she had already murdered him several days before. There might have even

been a slight sting of guilt in the nethermost recesses of her lost mind…

This is how I see Sotha Sil

I felt somewhat relieved to hear of his more enthusiastic attitude



Finally I will end with the more unfounded rumors and speculation surrounding the great

mage. Once again a quote from Almalexia “He began to speak of the fall of the Tribunal

and the return of the Old Gods. But Sotha Sil is not a Seer; he is a Maker. He shapes the

The heart? Artifacts? I lean towards choosing the heart. Few knew of its existence

Recent rumors in Skyrim indicated it might have been locked away in a dwemer lockbox

was Sotha Sil (in whatever short time of his life remained between the fall of the sixth house and the Nerevarine's arrival in 

Mournhold)

 First of all there is Durnehviir's relationship with Soul Cairn and the Ideal Masters. Though not literally soul trapped by the Ideal Masters they show a measure of control over it, and even the ideal masters might not be able to physically force a dragon soul into a gem.

 What seems more damning to the idea of dragon souls being untrappable is Serena's ability to partially soul trap the Dovahkiin's soul when entering the portal to Soul Cairn. Now my understanding is that the Dovahkiin is a dragon born into the body of a mortal, and it could potentially be used for enchantment.

 Here are some conceivable explanations for how Serena could accomplished her soul trapping without it meaning that dragons could be soul trapped in general. The Dovahkiin's soul could possibly have a black soul aspect of it, though this explanation ignores the unique properties dragon souls possess. Another justification of how Serena accomplished this feat is that she took a very small portion of the Dovahkiin, and that normally a dragon's soul would be far too large for any ordinary gem, but by this theory Azure's star should be able to contain a dragon soul.

A question I've been wondering since learning about the Great War was what Nord-Redgaurd race relations are like? It's no secret that most Nords are suspicious at best of elves, but do Nords view Reguards similarly to Imperials (i.e. not as brave/hardy/awesome as us, but still respectable)? Or is there distrust or some other view entirely? Considering the Redguards' choice to continue fighting in the Great War, do Nords see them with great respect? I would normally assume so, but I would have expected some Stormcloak in the game to laud Redguard bravery. The only evidence I can think of, personally, is that there are a handful of Nord-Redguard marriages in Skyrim. Are there any other pieces of evience I may be missing?

**Edit/Update**: So something interesting happened today while playing Skyrim. I was on my way to Ivarstead, believing her to be the the woman they were looking for (from the quest in Whiterun). The interesting part was that afterwards, the Redguard woman said something along the lines of ""tch, foreigners"" viewing the Alik'r with disdain. I thought that was pretty fascinating; a Redguard who is such a part of Skyrim that she views the Redguard of Hammerfell as ""lousy foreigners.""

1342201367.0,wic1i,An Unstable Past,ralphlizard,28,1,13,"I know we don't like to reference the games as such or overuse the Dragon Break in this subreddit too much

We see in Skyrim that the Dragonborn, indicating that the player character's truly has free will and is not bound by prophecy. This can be a bit problematic because of the prophecy of the last Dragonborn, but it could be that the player character is free to fulfill that prophecy or not, just like the Nerevarine prophecy. If the Dragonborn happens to choose not to fulfill the prophecy, another could be born or discovered to take up that mantle. Anyhow, I think it's general knowledge that no player character is bound by fate in any of the games.

Then comes the problem of writing the history of the player character. We know that in real life, Nerevarine's, Dragonborn's, etc's life are unstable as they are not bound by prophecy or determinism and thus, unknowable through history. The mages of the College of Winterhold may remember the Dragonborn as a master sorcerer of Altmer descent, while the Companions may remember him as a grizzled Nord warrior, and they may both be correct simultaneously.

We now turn our attention to [Divining of the Elder Scolls [sic]](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Divining_the_Elder_Scolls). 

""[The Elder Scrolls] offer a view of the flux of Time itself."" While the rest of this brief document implies that the future is indeterminate, but that represents only one such reading. However, the Elder Scrolls are variable in many details, but definitive in others. While the player character is free to choose his own fate, he/she is not free to interfere with certain definite events eg the fact that a Dragonborn defeats Alduin.

Now for the Warp in the West. This event could be a world-shattering event that was unique in that it wasn't defined in the Elder Scrolls. Perhaps, the two cataclysmic instances of undefined fate collided and caused a hugely unstable history. It was because the implications of this event was so massive that everyone in Tamriel happened to notice it and label it the Dragon Break.

Before analyzing the exact heritage of each and any intelligent species of Tamriel, we need to take a look at the creation of Nirn and Mundus itself.

 According to the legends, as we all know, Lorkhan was at this point already known as a trickster, and the other Et'Ada quickly lost faith in him. Most of them abondened Mundus, but not all. 

These that remained, laws of nature, used to stabilize the physics of Mundus, yet others settled the newly created world of Nirn as mortals, along with the Hist. As in almost all civilisations, not all of them agreed, and those left the homeland of the Ehlnofey

Eventually, shaping most, if not all, of its continents and oceans. The Hist, interestingly, remained neutral in this conflict (as is their nature). Alongside the reshaping of Nirn, the war also finalised the split between the Old Ehlnofey and the Wanderers.

Dear readers, I was on my out of Leyawiin and I find this shirtless ragamuffin calling out to everyone about how foolish *we* were. He must have been intoxicated on skooma or one of those other filthy substances they take. Anyway, he spurtled on about how ""foolish"" the Imperial beliefs were. On my way to Kvatch now, I'm having a sip of some brandy I bought for the travel, here's to hoping he gets some sense smacked into him.

Morndas

Kvatch has a lovely view around it. Look downhill and you can see for miles, right outside the chapel of Akatosh:

""Imperials! come around and Ahriq will tell you the truth of the greatest child of Fadomai and why this temple is praising the wrong time king.

When Ahnurr and Fadomai had birthed mighty Alkosh, so he had children to take some of his burdens.

Alkosh first gave birth to brothers

Now, for you made him take on the inbetween where Ahriel rested and Al'dun awoke. But now look at him! He has been broken so easily and horribly. First you dance on Ahriel's corpse and remake him, then the devils of the east break him and even your sacred emperor-god used the Brass-breaker! You let great Alkosh rest and then force him back into working when you hurt his sons!

Stop letting these liars tell you to praise the undead Ahriel without recognising his mighty father! god of all-time! You say your Talos is many headed, know the emperor had no connection to the *thing* you created. He, like those before him, had been blessed by mighty Alkosh. You think *that* [points at Akatosh again] could bless such men? Fools! Talos is a union of Alkosh blessed and but one form of Lorkhaj the betrayer.

Ahriq tells you now the truth, Imperials. Your Empire will not be the forever if it does not put its faith in the god of forever, that is why the two before this one failed and why this one will fail too. Do not think the dragon is an eternal form, he will return to himself when brother Al'dun saves him.""

1361091758.0,18oouk,RASHA GIVER WORDS BIG,Mr_Flippers,33,10,5,"Khajiit knows things many do not. Khajiit has seen more than most. Rasha has learned Tamrielic to tell you these things

Rasha has heard great Alkosh roar. It is louder than what any could imagine, we ran so fast those days without even a grain of moon sugar in rest. Alkosh had told Khajiit to travel far out of Elsweyr and towards the red mountain where we would meet the mighty warriors from cold sands.

Rasha was so shocked when he came to the red mountain base and met the Nords. Alkosh had roared us towards red mountain and Rasha sees Lorkhaj of all things! Why would Alkosh work with Lorkhaj? It was troublesome but Rasha understood that even they must join to stop the foolish golden devils.

Rasha was worried again for what he would have to do. Rasha is but Suthay and these Nords were big, and Rasha found comfort in his presence. Perhaps the most interesting was the Nord Ra'Wulfarth, whom tried to shout like Alkosh had roared. He was nothing against Alkosh, but he proved his strength and Khajiit respected it.

That battle was gruesome, as most big Nords with Khajiit fought the main forces of golden devils bot above ground and in the deep but the Ra'Wulfarth, some of his men and the Rhojiit rode up the Red Mountain to strike at the most powerful of devils.

This is where Rasha was lucky, but Rasha found it easier than the stranded Nords who wanted to follow Ra'Wulfarth. When Rasha finally reached the top, he saw the devils numbered 6 and Ra'Wulfarth fighting some of them. It was most interesting, Rasha looked upon one in the robes and recognized him as Mage; Khajiit believes he heard him referred to as ""S'tha"". Rasha respects S'tha for that devil was powerful with magic yet did not use it against Khajiit, it was duty that brought both of us there.

Dumalacath had taken a sword to Ra'Wulfarth's neck when it had appeared to end, many did so. A most strange thing happened after that, as Zira and Rasha looked upon Ra'Wulfrth in the distance he had shouted to Jone and Jode themselves and moved them! What happened next Rasha will never forget.

Each and every Rhojiit who was not Senche had transformed into Senche and fought in a frenzy above the Red Mountain, we both looked at Ra'Wulfarth who had been blasted into ash and blown down to the west. The insane Rhojiit had followed the ashes into the land where they were placed by wind, the Nordic home Skyrim.

2 days later on that awful island Zira and Rasha found ourselves in front of Sheggorath. He looked at us and showed anger, so knowing the silly god's traits it had to have been a healing staff.

It wasn't. Khajiit used the staff on Zira and he became a chicken.

The mad child laughed and laughed

Zira was most lucky though. Lorkhaj had entered the mad lands and taken Zira back for his bravery, the thought of staying there forever, but Alkosh had come not long after and brought Rasha back right where Zira was in Elsweyr. This is where Rasha learned it is most important to forgive, for even though Lorkhaj had acted so terribly to his brothers and sisters, he still aided Khajiit and worked with Alkosh.

Rasha has not aged since that day. Rasha does not know why

Rimmen made things worse for Rasha. Rasha never goes to Rimmen anymore. The town is fine, they are thieves greater than Rajhin. Only the Empire steals truth.

Now, looking so... Big. Did the Nords build it? Impossible, we are too south for that. Was it the deep devils? It lacked their common features. Perhaps even a child of Fadomai's? But then who? Rasha cannot tell you, nobody knows who built that place. But the Empire found interest in it. At least, Rasha saw imperials and their uniforms there, it had to be them. Rasha will not bore you with petty details, but Rasha discovered another powerful Mage there.

""Su'rin"" Rasha thinks. It was hard to hear. But words are not what Rasha was amazed by. It was Big Walker.

The Empire must have stolen again, too.

If Rasha tells you in this book ""Rasha is not sick"" it is a lie. No cat or man or elf would ever be ok after what happened. After Rasha had left the great halls, you see Suthay. You look at glow-rocks, you will see the skulls and bones of many who tried to walk through and died. Rasha has met some who tried to walk through, they came back as though they dragged their tongues in fields of skooma. And the vomiting, Khajiit does not want to speak of the vomiting.

You may ask Rasha ""why give these words""? Rasha has no answer

For now, speak of knowledge and wisdom, Rasha has lived long enough to hear all the boring tales, it is refreshing to hear good words.

And now

*Imperial Report on the Origin of the Sload

Greetings to all who may read this. I am scholar Flavius Lupus of the Synod, however. Those of you who have studied the plagues that have stricken our great Empire, such as the Knahaten Flu, will probably be familiar with the Thrassian Plague, the devastating disease that led to the eventual destruction of the Coral Kingdom of Thras, home of the Sload, by the All Flags Navy. I was granted special audience with a member of the Psijic Order recently who told me the story of the Sload creation myth, before the Men and Mer as we know them today came to be. It goes like this:
_____________________________________________________________________
During a battle between the Ehlnofex armies, N'Gyre, as he called himself, and he watched briefly as N'Gyre began to raise up the broken bodies of his comrades.

At this “most foul of injustices”, ""Look at this, what atrocities you have committed! All this evil done with impunity, and a clear conscience on your part! You should bear the shame of a thousand betraying soldiers, for you fight not only through the use of others' power, but with the power of your own comrades!""

Hearing the rebuke, ""Trinimac, you may be the Champion God of Lord Auri-El, but when you have passed your usefulness and begin to wither, there shall I stand, ready to rekindle the flame of your passion, but with my own choice fuel, and you will serve me on bended knee.""
Trinimac, but it was not yet allowed. Trinimac first attempted to slay the Necromancer with brute force, charging from behind him and, with a great swing of his blade, chopping through N’Gyre’s body. The body exploded into ash, and behind Trinimac stood N’Gyre, grinning with content. With the most sly of looks coming over his face, “Oh, “What was that you said about me being a traitor? You should listen to your master before you act too rashly.” Trinimac bellowed

Yet again, but again was not given permission to kill N’Gyre. He tried his same tactic again, but with some underlying cunning, having a powerful mage cast a decoy spell similar to N’Gyre’s while Trinimac crept up behind the Necromancer. But N’Gyre, wise in the ways of life magics, disregarded the intangible decoy and evaded Trinimac’s attack yet again. Clearly upset by this repeated treachery, N’Gyre turned and approached Trinimac, “You, so that you can betray me

Trinimac, saying, “Master, he has corrupted the souls and bodies of our most brave forces, yet he claims to be venerating them, restoring them, and he insults me
Auri-El, “Trinimac, my Strong-Arm, do as you see fit to the necromancer N’Gyre, if only so that your pestering will be ceased. Truly, he is powerful, and he serves our forces well, but it must be so.” At his word

 Swift and clever as N’Gyre was, had outwitted him. Trinimac had all of his anger and ferocity in his attack, and his brute strength finally took the mage by surprise. Trinimac, with a final, powerful swing of his blade, brought what he called “justice” to N’Gyre, and cut him into pieces, and a strange purple emission rose up from each of the ash piles, withdrew from the place

After Trinimac had departed, a proud, clever race was born, the Sload. The pieces of N'Gyre that were too small to sink became the islands of the Coral Kingdom of Thras, and the energy of N'Gyre and his final spell lingered on, infusing necromantic power in each of us from birth.

_____________________________________________________________________

The Psijic monk continued with his own information, like Namira, Mistress of the Grotesque, Peryite, the Father of Disease, and the K’Gar Nam’k, the Masters of Souls, an end which is a well kept secret among them and their leaders. I do not know of this secret

---

Old King Borgas had a dream, ruler of the little land-that-was-once-my-kin's, why are you abed? You must away, away to crush the little not-men who live in the deep woods that lie beyond your Alessia's jungled realm! For they are the last threat to the Order you swore to support, and once they are gone, there will be peace, and your kin shall rule all of this land!""

So King Borgas rose from his bed, home of the great Companions of Ysgramor, Borgas' kin-father. Borgas supped with the noble warriors who dwelt there, and arose the next morning, intent on crossing the Great Mountains down into the jungled south. But before he could leave, a Man, fair of hair, ran up to him.

He Spoke: ""Borgas, you shall be worse! Stay, do not invoke the wrath of these Elves, for you will be Hunted down and ended! Heed my words!""

But Borgas thought of the words of the Dragon, it is not I who shall be Hunted, but the Elf-kin who make trouble for the Cyrodiils in their land! Stand aside, you wretched villain, or I'll have you strung up by your legs and kept imprisoned!"" And the King and his army rode on.

They reached the pass southward, with the voice of a maiden fair. ""O Borgas, King of these people, do not go south! Only death awaits you and your kin! You will be Hunted to the ends of this world, and not one of your line will survive it! Take pity on the lives of your kin and return to the snow-bound palace of your fathers!""

But Borgas again thought of the words of the Dragon, to question a king of men? For I am a Tongue, strong and proud! I am of the line of Ysgramor, and I shall not fail! Away from me, I say, away! Leave us be, or I shall wear your fur as a cloak!"" And the King and his army rode on.

They reached the great Tower White-Gold, and they agreed that it was a sign of his divinely-given victory. They stayed in the City there for a fortnight, and set out for the borders of the jungled land of Cyrodiil. As they stepped out of the jungles, an old Fox, fur streaked with silver, called out to the King. He spoke. ""Borgas! King over men from distant lands! Turn back, for the Hunt shall soon be upon you! Leave while you and your line still may, the forests of Valenwood will be your doom. Your land will be torn asunder! Turn back

But Borgas again thought of the words of the Dragon, to speak to me of fate? For I am fated to crush these tree-dwelling Elves beneath my boots, and your portents of doom will not dissuade me! Away from me, I say, away!""

But the Fox Spoke again. ""You have made your choice then. Fool-King Borgas, and the line of Ysgramor shall be Hunted down to the last, even to the bastards hidden from all knowledge. The land is rent from you, and your people shall go their own way. But you, fool that you are, shall not enter into My realm. You may keep your crown of power for a time, till one more worthy than you takes it again. Go now to your doom."" And the Fox ran up

Borgas drew a knife and killed the Fox. His men quaked with fear

But the words of the Fox were a dire foretelling, beasts more fearsome and terrible than any could imagine, charged out at the King and his army from the forests. Borgas was struck down, and he breathed his last under the boughs of a mighty oak tree. His generals ordered a retreat, and his body was rushed off of the field. 

The dead were many, and the King was quickly buried in a grand tomb he had prepared for himself. Fearing the words of the Fox, the men left the Jagged Crown of Ysgramor's line with him, his eternal keepsake. They sealed that place, and forgot about the Fool-King, King Borgas, for kinsman fought against kinsman in a bitter war for the Throne of Ysgramor.

Magicka comes from the portals to Aetherius, the residue from the unused magicka is what causes the lifespan increase, because Aetherius is the *immortal* plane.

When you have the key to immortality within your body, you tend to last a bit longer, but not as long as those living in Aetherius.

My question is a little bit complicated and goes a little more complex:

* How much control does a normal being have over their werewolf abilities

* Is the transformations strickly night time or are they provocative (maybe random)?

* Can a being starve to death if the bloodlust is not pleased (like in bloodmoon)

However, I'd love it. I want to know who the heroes were, what they did, where they were from. I want to know their *name*. Why? Because such ambiguity completely blocks uncharted spaces of lore that we can never know. The heroes are among the most important figures in Tamriel's history, among people like Talos and Vehk, who would be given just as much lore to themselves as them.

[This post](http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/yscdt/sneaky_marketing_or_how_i_learned_to_stop/) in /r/truegaming discusses how Skyrim, when I first played Skyrim's MQ, I made my Dovahkiin look like the Skyrim mascot - and not completely consciously. It just felt right that way. I've tried playing different Dovahkiins since, but it doesn't feel right, because they don't look like the mascot. And I have no objection to it - I can play something that's pretty close to *the* Dovahkiin. He has an image. He just needs a name and a story.

[Star Wars (Old Republic era) spoilers:](/s "" An example of what I'm talking about is Revan. KotOR has been one of my favorite games since I was a kid, but there was always an inevitable and looming feeling over it that didn't let you forget that they couldn't tell you much more; his face always left in darkness by the hood he never lowered. Since then, however, he's appeared in the flesh in SWtOR, with a face and a voice. He'd been unveiled - a novel was written about him, because he'd become a character rather than just a protagonist, and those aspects of Star Wars lore could be accessed. It felt right - Revan is one of the biggest figures in Star Wars history

Now before you start thinking that I'm babbling on about games and not lore, so that the lore around them can be fleshed out? Knowing the heroes wouldn't just mean fulfilling fanboy dreams, it would mean that no lore is tiptoed around. It would mean reading MK texts about what the heroes got up to after they saved the world, or seeing their biography on bookshelves in the games.

1333219299.0,rmnx2,Thoughts of Dovahkiin,dyper017,27,4,60,"Disclaimer: This text may include heavy spoilers. It is also very long

The text is in two parts: the first considers the personality and character of Dovahkiin in Skyrim

**Of the Personality of Dovahkiin:**


The most common thought seems to be considering Dovahkiin as a brutal Nord. There is strong evidence to back Dovahkiin as a male, especially due to the game advertisements. For this reason, I shall refer to Dovahkiin as male. However, there is no evidence that Dovahkiin is in any way ""dumb"" or ""savage."" When the events leading to the downfall of Alduin are taken into account, there is no reason to consider his intelligence as below-average.

During the main quest in Skyrim the Dragonborn is forced to:

- Infiltrate an embassy

- Talk over Esbern

- Gain entrance to the College of Winterhold (I know that demonstrating a shout will do

- Be able to learn about Kel

- Navigate through difficult political negotiations where *both sides hate each other*

- Device a careful trap to fool a Dov

- Solve countless puzzles in extremely hostile circumstances

A valid counter-argument is that the Dovahkiin gains a great deal of help from those wiser than him

Other reason to defend Dovahkiin is that we shouldn´t let stereotypes rule. Quoting from [Words and Philosophy:](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Words_and_Philosophy)

&gt; ""The archetype of the idiot fighter is as solidly ingrained as that of the brilliant wizard and the shrewd thief, together with the swordsinger of the Redguards, who was said to be able to create and wield a blade with but the power of his mind. The future of the intelligent blade-wielder looks bleak in comparison to the glories of the past.""

The reason Dovahkiin wields a blade does not make him a brute

Dovahkiin can in short time achieve pretty much anything. He can save the world as we know it

&gt; ""Perhaps those who seek to hasten the end shall delay it"" -Paarthurnax

Dragonborn may become the Arch-Mage, there is no point in downplaying him as anything less than a Hero. Of course, it depends on the backstory of all Dovahkiin, but lorewise there is no basis to claim him stupid.


**Being Dragonborn**


In Tamriel

Let us start with Alessia. She is credited with having the blood and soul of a dragon. This makes her inevitably Dovahkiin. From her covenant with Akatosh was created the Amulet of Kings

After someone has gained Dragon Soul they are able to avoid death. When such a person dies

The Dragon Blood is in itself a special entity, if we consider the Amulet as containing some of the divine essence of Akatosh, and only the Dragon Blood can store that essence so one can wear it. In addition, the Dragon Soul would prevent the soul of a dead dragon from escaping and force it to the Dragon Blood a “soul trap” for dragons, if you like.

This differentiation nicely explains why CoC was unable to wear the Amulet of Kings but be able to fool death: he had the Soul of the Dragon, could not fool death, but was able to wear the Amulet – he had the Blood but not the Soul.

In Dovahkiin these two independent concepts come together in a unique way: there is a person who can devour Dragon Souls and fool death. But why all of this? Why is it necessary to even consider these? Reason is simple. The Dragon Soul is directly related to CHIM.

Let us review those who we know for certain have been Dragonborn: St. Alessia. [Sainted.]( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Alessia) Reman Cyrodiil. [Considered divine.]( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Reman_Cyrodiil#Reman) Tiber Septim. Talos. All of these have been divinized. Let us widen the range to those with the ability to fool death (and if the assumptions are correct, CHIM. Cyrus, CHIM. Nerevarine, CHIM. Champion of Cyrodiil, CHIM. Dovahkiin, CHIM. Vivec, CHIM.

There is no contradiction between immortality by Dragon Soul and the list above

Back to the point. The Dragon Soul in itself would not grant CHIM; it would be necessary but not adequate in order to achieve CHIM. That is why the Dov have not done it; the concepts related to CHIM are outside of their scope of understanding, that Nerevarine gained it from Azura and CoC from Akatosh when he received the Amulet of Kings from the Emperor and chose to act to defend Tamriel, despite his own safety.

Necessary result from this is that the association of Dragon Soul and Akatosh is greatly overestimated, he gradually gains the ability to manipulate time (another Akatosh - connection), and gains understanding of his surroundings faster than those around him. This is commonly referred as having Dragon Soul. The Dov are immortal, and not bound by time, so this explanation suits them as well.

To return to the Dovahkiin of Skyrim: 

&gt; ""The World-Eater wakes

I see the Last Dragonborn here meaning the last of those with both Dragon Blood and Soul. In that case, although the giant statue hindered the view somewhat. It is of divine essence, so it could just return in time to somewhere it had already been, just waiting for the new Dragonborn Emperor.

Mankar Camoran has to be considered here, he would have necessary gained the Dragon Soul. Somehow he also ended up gaining the Dragon Blood in the process, or then we assume he was born with the Blood. Other option is that his Paradise was somehow disconnected from Mundus in such a way that the Amulet was lacking in power, or simply that Mankar chose to levitate the Amulet in front of his throat just to look flashy. There was no time to conduct quality experimentation because he killed my CoC around 64 times before laid to rest (note to myself: when level 5 and going against high-level caster, **bring silence poisons**).

Perhaps the most important trend so far with individual relation to Dovahkiin is that every person credibly with both the Soul and Blood of the Dragon

However



The bosmer, as their name in their own tongue means), in Cyrodiil better known as the Woodelves, are a race of mer from the forested province of Valenwood, on the southern shore of Tamriel. They are a curious people, regarded as some of the best archers around, albeit lazy ones.

The biology of the Woodelves is significantly different from that of other Elves. Even though they share the affinity for magic, which is shorter than the female and the rest of the Tamrielic species (not counting the Alfiq Khajiit subspecies). This short and somewhat plump build helps them greatly in navigating the dense forests of their homeland. Because of their lifestyle (which in some circles is described as rudimentary), they have developed a resistance to most diseases. Alongside this, they have the ability to control more simple minded creatures, of which there is plenty in Valenwood. Lastly the elves of Valenwood hold a darker power of which they don't like talking, called 'the Wild Hunt', which will be explained later.

There are some sources on the origin of the Bosmer. The Altmer hold that, which would explain their shorter and compacter build. However, the Bosmer themselves hold a different theory, which might not be as farfetched as it seems at first sight.

The Bosmer believe they descend from Aldmer who were blessed with something called 'the Green Pact'. This pact, made the Bosmer the keepers of the forest, and shaped them to better suit the wood life. According to this pact, the Bosmer are not aloud to harm any form of flora, and as such are required to feed and build solely with animal materials (they have been lenient with this rule, as imported wood and other plant material is allowed). A disturbing side affect of this, is that Bosmer are obliged to eat their fallen foes, including other Bosmer. In case of a sentient death

The Bosmeri culture is noted for being one of the most tolerant (although this has waned in the wake of the reestablishment of the Aldmeri Dominion). Bosmer readily except other races, possibly resulting in the Bosmer appearance (that is, if the Y'ffre theory appears to be false). This also made them the target of despise by their Altmeri cousins, who view men as evil.  
This tolerance has also led to some of the more interesting pantheons on Tamriel. Alongside some of the more typical Aldmeri deities, an aspect of the god Zenithar, whose power is now toil and payment in kind, and Herma-Mora takes the same role he has in Nordic religion. They also venerate some gods, like the Moon Gods, like the Khajiit do, their ancient rivals. Alongside these gods of mixed heritage, namely Y'ffre. Alongside his role as maker of the Green Pact (as noted above), the creatures took every form, and the ritual required to regain it. Bosmer taking this form is called the 'Wild Hunt'. The Woodelves performing this ritual will transform in dark beasts
Because of the knowledge Y'ffre gave the Bosmer

Bosmer society divides the Bosmer in multiple clans and families. The clans have almost never been united, since some of them rarely to anything productive. Alongside this, Bosmeri troops are infamous for low discipline and deserting at the littlest sign of threat. Even though these traits are common in Valenwood, outside of their home province, they seem to easily adapt. It is not uncommon to meet them around Tamriel as traders, shopkeepers and fletchers.

The Bosmer are noteworthy archers. their fletch work is famous around Tamriel for being the best there is; their skills are so well known

Bosmeri culture dates back to the very start of the first era
During the first era, which resulted in a last resort treaty with the Altmer of the Summerset Isles to create the Aldmeri Dominion. Hundreds of years later, Valenwood was, like all other provinces, annexed by the empire, of which it remained part until the Thalmor seized it. The institution of Thalmor rule saw the decline of the openness so striking for Bosmeri culture.

The Altmer (meaning ""old"" or ""high/noble people"" in their own tongue), ""high"" doesn't necessarily denote noble or civilized, and is mostly used to refer to the arrogant and snobby attitude that some of them express towards the other races of Tamriel), are a tall and gold-skinned race of elves from the Summerset Isles. They are considered to be the most like the common elven ancestor, the Aldmer (see volume II for notes on this). They are well known for their incredible expertise with magic and their art, sometimes regarded as the height of culture.

The Altmer are easily distinguishable, surpassing even the Nords of Skyrim, towering over the other races, and having a yellow/golden skin colour. Along these remarkable traits, they also share the more common elven traits, namely pointed ears, a slender build, and a very strong affinity towards magicka. This affinity is, but are also more vulnerable to it. An other interesting characteristic is that

Historically, and find themselves isolated of the matters of the mainland on their own islands. Even though they did not take part in most of the early conflicts and problems of Tamriel, they weren't completely untroubled. Indeed, the Altmer have more than one time saved Tamriel from invasions (not out of care for the other species, but out of the fact that they were the first target), like the Sloads and the Maormer, along with some internal conflicts. During these wars, and formed an alliance with the Bosmer of Valenwood, after the Numidium was used to crush the Altmeri armies.
They remained part of the Empire until 4E 29, the Thalmor, a political, Altmeri supremacist, group, seized control of Valenwood, severed all ties with the Empire, after the historical union. During the next 150 years, further sundering the already waning power of the Empire. After the Concordat

The Altmer culture is noted for it's focus on Magicka and art. Like mentioned beforehand
Alongside the strong artistic traditions, including the Psijic order and the Mages Guild. Alongside this, some of the Archmages of the Mages Guild and Imperial Battlemages were Altmer, most notably Ocato of Firsthold, Battlemage, trusted advisor of Uriel Septim VII, High Chancellor of the Elder Counsil and Potentate of the Empire.

Despite their supposed selective breeding

Their culture is also known as being very structured and hierarchical, and their supposed selective breeding. This focus on Altmeri supremacy, in recent years advocated by the Thalmor, has met with resentment by the younger generations of Altmer, who express the desire of more peaceful relations with the other parts of Tamriel. Even though this new movement exists, most people of Tamriel are still more familiar with the Thalmor and their predecessors, and as such still regard the Altmer as being arrogant.
Their pantheon is vast, mostly related to magic (i.e. Magnus, Syrabane). Because of their Et'Ada heritage, they deeply hate Lorkhan, who they take responsible for making them mortal, along with any men-made additions to the different religions, most notably the Cyro-Nordic god-hero Talos (it is rumoured that the ban on the Talos-worship by the Thalmor is to further destroy the Towers, in the hope of regaining their divinity).

**Eplear and Pelinal**

^(Foreword and translation by Harman Maurus)

*The story of Pelinal Whitestrake, or pogroms, swept the Ayleids into obscurity, eradicating their mighty Cyrodiilic Empire from Nibenay, Colovia, and old ‘Kreath. Tales say he rampaged as far as Elsweyr, butchering scores of Khajiit he took for more of the hated mer. But this furious crusade across the southern half of the continent raises an interesting question. At the time of Pelinal’s crusades, pressed close against the hills of Colovia and actively harbouring his Ayleid foes, but the Bosmer have

*One such tale is the Song of Eplear, epic poem chronicling the conquest of Valenwood by Eplear Camoran, first king of the Bosmer, and ruler at the time of Pelinal’s conquests. The Bosmeri poetry is difficult, if not impossible, to translate with any finesse into Tamrielic (though any Bosmeris-speaker should consider locating a copy), but unlike most Bosmeri epics, but some appear Ayleid

Pelin-El came to the edge of Cyrod where the trees ceased to weep and began to sing

Those Ayleid who were wise fled where their stone did not go and vanished among the trees where their beads were like berries and their feathers were like leaves and where their brothers took them to hide. Their escape was an insult and Pelin-El demanded their elf-blood. The star-made-knight was bathed in the blood of elf-kings who fought him

The One King of the Elves in the South, whose helm was the skull of Great-Gold-Ape-King (whose bones were golden moonstone), and whose bow was the long wing of the Great-Roc-of-the-Hunt (whose shadow made the Boiche forget Magnus sometimes), and whose home was Green-Sap-Walking (whose blood was the blood of the forest). And Eplear King heard the call of Pelinal.

Eplear knew the seven-hundred benefits of hiding (and the three-hundred more that were his gift to all Bosmer), that are the treasure of all his people (and were his great mastery), but he did not hunt Pelin-El, for he knew not to this time. And Eplear knew Payment-in-Kind, which Z’en taught to Y’ffre (who taught it to his favourite children) and Z’en’s mirror-children reminded to the Boiche, and so to Eplear, so he knew that Pelin-El should be paid-in-kind with cutting swords and tears, for he knew not to this time. 

Instead, but he loosed none. Instead he loosed his mighty voice that won Valenwood.

“Pelin-El, bloodier of trees, many-shape (?) of Cyrod. Our strength is great and our forest is blessed. Your bloody hands have no hold on the green-sap.”

The man-beast was not to be deterred

But Eplear did not come out to die like those Ayleid kings.

Welcome to yet another Weekly Community Thread. It's been a great week and there is much to say

**Weekly Summary**

So the last few weeks have definitely shown relative inactivity, the sheer amount of reporting and the quickness in which we have responded this week were at an impressive all time high. We are very happy to see you guys using the report feature much more lately, and there is very much a reason why, I'm sure some have noticed, there has been a rise in quality commenting and content this week. 

To add to that, all of which were answered with detail and at great lenth, we have also gotten a pretty darn impressive amount of high quality posts. Some of those worth mentioning are [The Amaranth Summary by Sifrael](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1bue5q/amaranth_summary/), [The Sow and the Snake by OPgreenback](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1buyn1/the_sow_and_the_snake/), [On the History and Politics of Akavir by Alexxerth](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1byjl1/on_the_history_and_politics_of_akavir/), [The Nords and the Giants by Morganmarz](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1bzq5i/the_nords_and_the_giants/), and [Does the Dovahkiin have Dragon Blood, so I do advise you all do read them if you haven't yet. 

As for traffic, though, so we are happy to see lots of newcomers come and go.

**Announcements**

I do believe it is that time of the year again when we offer to revise the FAQ a bit for sake of lowering spam a bit. So, we would like you to format a comment for revision of the FAQ as such:

**Question**

Detailed answer, feel free to still post the question and ask for an answer, as long as you believe the question is too commonly heard and answered.

Thank you for anyone who wants to help contribute. Hopefully we will implement the revisions soon enough after the community thread goes inactive.

**Scholar of the Week**

In continuing with a latest thread of giving the honor to newer users, award alexxerth as this week's SoTW. Thank you for your activity, alexxerth, and I hope to see more from you in the future.

That is pretty much it for this week. I'll keep more personal stuff in the comments, and more specifically to discuss anything non-lore related as well as post cool content and introduce themselves if they are new or have just been lurking. I've also noticed the Weekly Threads have become home for some simple Q&amp;A style stuff, so feel free to do that, too, if you like.

1362104481.0,19fr2u,The Withering,xenoposeidon,26,2,12,"It was once strong.

Long ago, stood tall and enormous, casting great shadows over the southern landscape. *It* ruled over the land, and joined with it as one. The land itself was forest, from the darkened wet forest in the southeast, to the high forest hills with great tall trees in the northwest. From where the forest was dense and full of critters, to the almost lifeless forest that had its trees climb the steep rise of a great volcano. The land was a forest

It saw nothing, rare, so lonely and insignificant when compared to the enormous unity that was *It*. Some others were taller, numerous, and did not dance around the same way the other shadows did. Yet, while studying the shadows' pattern of dancing carefully, *it* did not alter itself

And then, joined each other close in their dancing. More shadows came, arriving from the West and the North. The many shadows greeted each other, furiously dancing closer and closer, until in a split second the shadows started devouring each other. Two shadows came together, danced, and one remained. Over and over the shadows devoured each other, fiercer

And then the shadows turned to *It* for power. They cut down the trunks of *It* to make fortified structures, drinking it to grow themselves healthier and stronger, hardening it to cover themselves with outfits out of *It*'s own blood. *It* could not respond. Never has anything so terrible and awe inspiring happened to the forest. *It* could not dance like the shadows, it could not see or speak or hear or touch like the shadows. To think and to feel were *it*s only available actions, but neither could slow down the shadows' rampaging dances. So *It* stood, and it felt, and it withered. 

First the trees in the north were gone, in the lands where the forest is dark and wet, less in the other side of the southern water, where the land was drier and warmer. There, *it* stood, and many of its trees. Yet the shadows were soon to come. They cut, and chopped, and there *it* stood, no sympathy

So the alterations stopped, and the thoughts and feelings grew weaker and more silent. Minute by minute, hour by hour, the tree felt weaker, more withered, more exiled. 

And then *it* was alone. *It* could not feel its wet roots in the southeastern soil, withering, shriveling. *It* could not sustain so many leaves and such a tall trunk, so it altered itself smaller, smaller. *It* shed its bark, dried its sap, withdrew its leaves. 

When the shadow came *it* was a white, run its hand on *it*s tiny shriveled branches, *It* was ready to die. *It* dried its sap to a deadly solid, shed its leaves completely, making it so the death would be easy and without pain.

The shadow picked up its metallic tool. And then the shadow left.

So there stood the Hist, in the heat of the once beautiful wasteland. 

It remembered nothing, under the scorching sun, it withered away, and became *nothing*.

*On a separate note, likely in secret.*

------

The relationship between the Imperial and the Imperialized is a relationship of domination^4, the Black Marsh becomes merely a backdrop, an exotic locale with a troubled people indebted to their heroic Imperial savior. The Imperial Geographical Society subtly discredits the Argophile historian Brendan the Persistent, suggesting in *Pocket Guide to the Empire, 3rd Ed.,* that his foolish respect for the Argonian people brought about his demise. In the same volume, the Black Marsh is referred to as “backward” and “the stuff of myth,” further solidifying the view of the Black Marsh as a place populated by the Other

The astute reader will be quick to note that the racism I have identified as underlying the Imperial project seems endemic to all conquering races. Indeed

But such outward racism will never be as effective at yoking the Argonian as the sublimely subversive Imperial project. Imperial subjects of all races either assume the status of citizen and succumb to the interpellation of Imperial culture or become Otherized if they reject the influence of Imperial culture and cling to their own. Neither option permits the Argonian to exercise his own agency. There is very little consent to be found

Note the tension here between the desires of the Imperial woman, as all Argonians must be defined, but by her sexuality and her willingness to be exploited. She becomes, as it were, *dehumanized.* This word, once bandied about by Imperial scholars, is now widely rejected, I propose



4.) Of *dominion

5.) I am not in the business of defaming my contemporaries, as if he was getting away with something by making his protagonist such an obvious author avatar. The possibility that the author of this erotica is not a member of the Imperial race does not escape me, but his pathologies are certainly shared by all humans under the panopticon of Imperial society. In Cyrodiil, there are reports of adventurers finding copies of Curio’s work even in caves inhabited (the Imperial would say ""infested"") with goblins; in Solstheim, finding the work in the hands of the elusive Rieklings is not unheard of. It is hard to determine the extent to which these beings understand the work. For all we know, they could be using the pages as bum wad. And good for them if that's the case; I'm sure the pages of Curio's work will smell much sweeter when all the hateful words have been covered in goblin faeces. 

6.) Volume 1

7.) Doubtless

8.) Note the author never refers to her by her Black Marsh name.


[…]

The Imperial of this narrative is characterized by civilization, submissiveness, and the exotic. Whereas the Imperial inhabits his head, the Argonian inhabits only her body. To Colto (and Curio, and too many readers), the Argonian maid’s intellectual and emotional faculties are of no significance; only her material body matters, her flesh which his wife can instruct to mop the floors and the Imperial nobleman can use to “bake his bread”^15

The few words we do know in dwemeris should be: 

*Fell - City

*Volen - Hammer

*Vvarden - Strong shield

*Drung - Might[mighty?]

However after reading 'The Ruins of Kemel-Ze' we can find an inconsistency in the language. This is because 'Ze' also appears to mean city. 
Now perhaps this is just a mistake or this can support the theory that the Dwemer language was changing over time

We can assume ze = zel because in the book Vvardenfell is spelled with one 'l' not the conventional 'll' so it can also be said that the 'zel' is also spelled with one less 'l' or even that a change in pronunciation has occurred in the language. 

Which leads me onto this: when we look at the dwemer language we should keep in mind that the ruins may hold old spelling or pronunciation from different regions/times making it harder to decode

However in one region (skyrim) we have a nice piece of dwemeris. The 'Rosetta stone'. 
I have been trying to decode the dwemer from common aleiyd words found on the falmer transcription. Using [this](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/aldmeri-alphabets) I think i may have found some skyrim-dwemer words. I'm not sure if these are already known but I will also continue to translate the dwemer words and post updates when enough have been found.

These words are:

*Kemel - Cliff

*Ze/Zel - City

*Chun - And

*Anum - Life

*Aka - King

*Mora - Wood

*Du - Nu(in Falmer) (possibly 'New' in english)

I cannot be 100% sure but am pretty confident with the ones already found
There is one last thing 'th' appears to mean 'your' whilst 'thua' might mean 'your' when referring to concepts or ideas leading me to think 'thuamer' means 'Your driven' and 'thua vanchningth' means 'Your eternal [besia]'
The reason I chose 'chun' over 'th' as being 'and' is because we see many comers where the 'Chun' should be.

.

.




Gather round, and now I suffer for the tricks of my youth! Rockjoint spreads all through my bones, and soon I'll not be able to walk 't'all. Still, here is a story passed down from my da, and to him from his da, and so into the distant green years no living man recalls.

Once, but he sought to make his name known throughout Cyrodiil. See, them men of Cyrodiil love their books even more than we hardy folk love a good story 'round the fire, and even certain bad books by stupid men were somewhat well-received in those days. So the young writer sat down to make sense of the histories of men long-dead, that which came before our bless'd Talos took the throne of the Empire.

I d'no if you young ones have heard this or not, with petty kings and weak rulers, and the whole of the Empire in confusion. So this fool writer took it upon himself to tell the ""real"" story of what happened in this time, this Interregnum, as the history-men call it. And so he sealed his doom. Keep in mind, there were a few records of that time.

He, and - curse his stupidity! - he even took away some of our mighty Talos' deeds at the close, for his farce ends when the great and mighty Talos' wars began. He first decided to set a stage - three kings of three realms arrayed against each other. All vied for the Ruby Throne, and fought constantly for it. But, this was no great tale, he thought. He then recalled that the histories of the last year of the First Era focused on the cursed daedra Prince, Mehrunes Dagon. So, a villain cloaked in the form of a daedra prince. Molag Bal

Mind you, and be a dragon as large as Solitude at my own will.

So his three kings united 'gainst the cursed daedra Prince Molag Bal, was tryin' to draw all of us and the world with us into *his* world, if you can believe that. I suppose the barriers them Psijic mages put up didn't apply, or he just forgot they existed like he forgot the rest of our world's history, but either way, that was his backing. Next, he made an unknown, step forward to aid the kings united as they strove with the hordes of Coldharbour.

And by chance, one of which was a true Nord, of strong Voice and stronger arm. They fell away at the might of the daedra, but this lone champion stepped forward, and by ""previously unknown Dawn magicks"", as he put it, he sealed away the daedra Prince Molag Bal

All his lies completed, who made him a few copies to give out. Thank the Nine those stuck-up Cyrodiils in the Imperial City laughed in his face and refused to buy such a travesty.

Now, what was the point of the story if all that happens is he's laughed at?"" Well, my kin-children, fret not. The lesson is this: the fool, wandering through the forests southeast of the City, a copy of his cursedly-terrible play in hand, came upon a majestic Elk. He looked as if Hircine himself would consider him a true prize and joy to hunt, he failed to realize two things: firstly, while rare

The fool crept closer, didn't see that it was dead, but it held his weight nonetheless. He was suddenly struck by the idea to sketch the great Elk, so he reached back into his pack for his book.

However, down, till the end of the great Elk's antlers pierced through the fool playwright's heart. And so he died, and his terrible play met an equally bad end, for the Elk loved nothing more than to devour books whole. So our tale ends, with the body of the foolish playwright never stirring again, and a very merry Elk chewing up the last bits of that terrible play. And so, for the Elk conquered the fool without even trying.

So, let this, and mine own condition, be lessons to you - don't practice deceit! For should you, you may end up like me, unable to move or do a thing to help yourself, or you may end up like the fool, self-gored on an Elk greater than you.",t5_2t5ay,True

Greetings, welcome to this week's Community Thread. We have a lot to talk about, so let's get started:

---

This week was a rather interesting one in /r/teslore. After last week's glory, this was rather a good week, we've seen plenty of good posts, but I will get to them a little bit later. Before starting up the normal way of things I'd like to discuss new scholars and the FAQ.

Our subreddit is slowly but surely getting more and more popular. In just four months we have amassed 2400 new scholars, has some good and some bad effects. 

New scholars mean more original content, questions that have been repeated 30 times over and misunderstandings already understood by many older members. 

This is no reason to be angry at new users, new scholars must learn through trial and error what subreddit members like and what they don't. For this reason, I will be posting a *guide for new scholars* shortly. Reading both the guide *and* the FAQ will be very important.

Talking of the FAQ

And so there shall be.

As time passes, nor will it be the only one in a while. Anytime you have any question that you think should be answered in the FAQ *please* tell me in that week's community thread. For today, please post any question you want answered on the FAQ in this format:


**Question**

Response (shouldn't be too long

*source*

Please do help me with this. If you don't comment now you're complaining later will be annoying and irrelevant. 

Thank you for reading the rant. Now

---

As I've already said, we are slowly but steadily growing in ranks, with 86 new scholars this week. New scholars please go ahead and post about yourselves and give us a little introduction in the comments. It would be great if you old members would welcome the new scholars and perhaps even introduce yourselves to them. The community in this subreddit is important, and different members' interactions with others members is also very important. Do remember this is the purpose of these threads, to give space for community discussion and more lore-irrelevant talk. Talking of the community and it's good members, time to reveal this week's

**Scholar of the Week**

This week was quite a definite choice. This scholar, as well as replied to other's threads in a thoughtful and understandable manner. This week's Scholar of the Week is:

**Ornerycretin**

Thank you very much for posting, and there is no doubt that you should be mentioned for it. Wuuthrad, Pedanterrific, and Lilrhys are waiting for you at The Honorable Men's Tavern (See, I named it now!) to celebrate your achievement. 

---

Thank you guys for another great week. I am currently in a pretty challenging phase, keep on doing the awesome job, and I'm just going to say how much I love being a moderator of this fine community again. I hope you guys had a great week, remember to post suggestions for the FAQ and tell me about your week in the comments (Again, I do care.) Also post any suggestions or complaints, I'll be glad to hear them and will take your opinions into my consideration. Have a great weekend, and keep on postin'

Welcome to yet another Weekly Community Thread, we are back to our normal posting schedule! 

**Weekly Summary**

I'd like to begin by welcoming the 154 new scholars that have come across /r/teslore this week and decided to stick around to listen to and discuss with us in our many discussions. And when I say many discussions, so good job contributing everyone. I also like that there seems to be at least detailed and thoughtfully written comment in many or most threads this week.

Aside from that

**Announcements**

No special announcements this week

**Scholar of the Week**

Referring back to my statement that everyone's been doing very well this week

That said, so why not. Next week a large portion of us mods are going to be either going on or continuing their trips in various countries, leaving Mr. PoPs to face the horde of shitposting the we hide under the [redacted] tag in quite the solitary way, so I'm going to hand him the award for volunteering for such a job. Pray we don't happen to get plugged.

That said, this is the best way to do so. We used to have a lot of reporting but have no-where near as much nowadays, so I'd be happy to see you guys go back to helping us out.

Right, be it introducing yourself if you are new, talking about your week, or whatever you feel like doing.

The subreddit has been growing wildly and the number of scholars is skyrocketing, the moderation is always looking to improve the subreddit, yet in order to do so we must garner new ideas and people to bring those ideas about in action.

Therefore the Elder Council has decided we are going to welcome a new recruit into the team. It was decided that

In the comments of this thread, the scholar with the most community support will be welcome to join the moderation team.

Remember, and having a record of activity and helpfulness on the subreddit, will both make a scholar more suitable to be a moderator. A moderator should also have a reason to join the moderation team, that is whether the nominated scholar wishes to improve the community, and whether they have the time and are willing to put forward the effort to actively and continuously moderate the subreddit. That means going everyday and looking through all recent posts and comments and identifying which ones break the rules, actively participating in moderator discussion, and being able to quickly respond to reports and the concerns of different users. Moderation is still a job, but there's also work to put in.

The traits and skills listed above should be considered by any who wish to nominate themselves. Please explain how you match the descriptions above and tell us why you believe you would make a good moderator in your nomination comment. Just posting your name and your desire is not enough.

We do have one rule about the voting that you should keep in mind

There shall be absolutely no advertising or garnering support for your nomination outside of this thread. If the moderators find or have evidence of anyone advertising their nomination in any other subreddit or community either linked or not linked to /r/teslore in any way

That's really all you need to know. The Winner of the Election will be announced in next week's Community Thread. Good luck to all candidates!

I thereby request this gathering of esteemed scholars review and critique the manuscript as you see fit.

I know that I will likely be killed for what I write in these pages, and I'd rather be killed by a priest than a mudcrab.

I open with a story that I know to be true: Hundreds of years ago there was a man above men. This was the man that closed the gates to Oblivion throughout Cyrodil, a virtual cornucopia of brilliance and decay, all with a sickening patina of insanity. Most importantly, however, this hero witnessed order. He observed the linearization of absurdity, the organization of chaos. Behind this order sat a library, kept by an immortal librarian, these books held knowledge beyond the reach of so-called gods. This is the order of knowledge I seek

I posit that there are no gods. But what of the Oblivion gates? What of the Divines? ""My wife was cured by a priest!"" You say, but I am inclined to believe that, despite the undeniable existence of the plethora of planes in this universe, all power is derived from the reality we experience. I say that the sun is no hole in reality, the planets are not the bodies of dead gods, the daedra are not immortal spirits and the divines are a consequence, not an impetus.

Let us begin with Aetherius and the sun and stars. I was told, perhaps, every living being's soul is comprised of it. *I*, on the other hand, disagree with this explanation, as it is lacking both in evidence and in rigor. I have observed, through the use of a salvaged Dwemer astronomical device, chasing their tails, but it is more so. The sun is so massive that it pulls itself inwards, much like how the Dwemer ignited gas in an empty cylinder with the thrust of a piston

Now I will address the subject of magic use. As a practitioner of magics myself I became frustrated at the colleges and guilds for their total ignorance of how magic operates. It is your will, they lectured, that pours forth our power; it is our soul, they wrote, that gives us access to these wonders; no, say I, you have it only half-right. Indeed, it seems that the sun, assuming my theories on the sun are correct, this is not the sum of magicka generation. I believe
If I will lightning from my fingers I lose a reserve of magicka, it becomes part of the environment and one must inhale again to replenish their reserves. So, too, does magicka, taking form as I will it to, become environmental, and a mage must inhale ambient magicka to replenish. The accumulation of magicka is two-fold: first, e.g. magicka potions, and, especially if one considers that sunlight may
The mage's connection to magicka is through their will, through their mind. The mind exerts itself through the organization of one's internal magicka like a child playing on a beach: first, one's will digs a channel through the sands of matter, creating a vacuum, then that vacuum is filled with the seawater of one's own magicka, shaped by the type of vacuum created. Thus it is not the release of magicka that defines its manifestation, but rather the manner of vacuum through which it travels. (It may be of some note that one may liken the act of will to a tether, with the energy of magicka traveling along it, being unstable matter, again

Now I address the gods. I do not deny the evidence of the daedra, for only a fool would ignore the magic of their shrines. However, I do not believe that either are what we think they are. First, I shall consider the daedra and their planes of Oblivion. These beings, whose princes are undeniably gifted in the manipulation of magicka, are no more than the most powerful wizards. I propose that, instead of using the radiation from a magicka engine, or a plane), likely, to accumulate the initial magicka and to prevent such an engine from destroying your mind and exploding outwards into the plane
The divines and their ilk, by my investigations, do not exist, at least, not in the conventional sense. In fact, they are figments of a collected will and are fulfilled by magicka siphoned from the sun. Every shrine built in their honor, every prayer said in their name and every story told of their virtues widens further the vacuum. As shrines are the locations at which the most will is exerted they are the locations at which the most magicka flows in, therefore, but by an institution of wills. This may seem like an excellent opportunity for the common man to enjoy the benefits of magic, the less there is to prevent invasions from the Oblivious planes and the less there may be to stabilize grand projects performed by mage collectives. While harmless in moderation

In short, in meditation, is still, a vacuum, that absorbs magicka. When casting, the mage forms vacuums in reality and fills them with magicka. Daedra internalize the annihilation of matter to maintain the Oblivious planes. The Divines and their kin don't exist, instead they are the result of many wills drawing in magicka

Though I may be proven wrong on many points I believe that my methods are sound and my logic is clear. If I am claimed to be wrong

Regarding Malacath, but is also seen supporting ogres and trolls. Why would Trinimac-turned-Malacath even care for the ogres?

I'm not entirely sure about Trinimac still being alive, not considered a daedra lord amongst the other daedra. Maybe Boethiah, being the prince of plots, tricked Trinimac's followers in to believing that Malacath was indeed Trinimac corrupted, tricking them into following Malacath instead of Trinimac. 
Since Malacath is the god of outcasts and the bloody curse

This week we are continuing to see a sharp rise in the number of scholars, is also a lot larger. This week we also saw a great amount of activity, yet it seems that the number of threads is ever so slightly decreasing with the newcomers settling down and not rushing to post their questions. This means that more of you guys are reading the FAQ and the New Scholar's Guide, which I am very happy about. Thanks for that, now let's move on.

As I was saying, such  as [The Revised Imperial Report on the Origin of the Sload, by Flavius Lupus, Synod Scholar](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/17omee/the_revised_imperial_report_on_the_origin_of_the/) by B-rad-oleary, as well as [The Eight Stories of Y’ffre and the Eight Promises of the Bosmer](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/17icta/the_eight_stories_of_yffre_and_the_eight_promises/) and [The Boiche: A Treatise on the Elves of Valenwood, Part I](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/17i9cl/the_boiche_a_treatise_on_the_elves_of_valenwood/), both by Lebiro.

Aside from that we are quickly shooting past the 8000 subscriber mark and heading for the 9000, welcome to the subreddit!

That said and done

**Scholar of the Week**

This week we have a scholar who is (sadly) one of the only remaining active scholars that have been here since the start of the subreddit. In any case, both this week and the weeks before, I do hope to see part 2 of your The Boiche threads soon, I know you've been working hard on it from your posts on Attrib.

---

That's it for this week

Thanks everyone for your activity, Beyonce, or the actual game, and also hope that all you non-American scholars had just as much fun this weekend as the Americans did. So keep on posting and discussing, scholars, and have a great week!

Anyways, before going into festivity and other such things, let's recap the week and choose a scholar of the week:

---

Well, everyone, let's hope this trend does not stop and only improves. This particular week we have gained 119 scholars are now just over half-way to the next Big-round-number-milestone. With the influx of new scholars heading in, we are seeing mostly question threads which are all answered thoughtfully, but that did not stop great explanations and apocryphas from being posted as well. This week three threads stood out to me, those being [Constellations and the Lessons by RottenDeaditte](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1546io/constellations_and_the_lessons/), [Orsinium and the Orcs: After the Warp in the West by Myrrlyn](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/151r8r/orsinium_and_the_orcs_after_the_warp_in_the_west/) and [The Unburning Flame by Ishullanu](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/14zif3/the_unburning_flames_proper_use_of_pyromancy/). Thanks for posting, and keep on doing what you do.

That's all for the weekly recap

The reddit admins have recently introduced a new reddit wiki system which allows users to create and edit their own wiki pages for a specific subreddit. This works in much the same way as Wikipedia and other similar sites, but we'd like to know your opinions on the matter: what would you all like to see in teslore's wiki? The only real possibility we've been able to think up is a sort of ""Hall of Fame"" for exemplary posts, but we'd like to have more community involvement than that- tell us what you think!

---

**Scholar of the Week**

Tough pick this week, the Scholar of the Week title goes to Scholar [RottenDeadite](http://www.reddit.com/user/RottenDeadite). Thank you very much for your activity and contribution, Rotten, it is about time you get the title.

---

Alright

Instead of the normal casual Community Thread discussion in the comments, one big family, and being with your family is much of the point of the Holiday season (Beyond Babylonians spoiling our candles, little baby Jesus being born, and the sun deciding that it hates everyone for one day).

So

* How is your winter going?

* What holiday are you celebrating and with who?

* How said holiday is going/gonna go for you?

* What are you getting for said holiday

Personally my family has just finished celebrating Hannukah

So yes, and got to see it in a petty much empty theater (which was goddamn awesome). It's always good to go see the world where all fantasy lore derives from.

Alright

That is all I have to say for now, and have a great Midwinter!

Welcome once again to the Weekly Community thread, and are now just half way to the next subscriber milestone. This is a great start to what I think will be a future of a lot more activity and thus a greater sense of community.

If you are new to the subreddit and are wandering what in the Hist I'm doing ranting about the community

---

To go on to the weekly overview, and we continue to gain lots of new scholars. Just this week we have gained 179 new scholars, a number which I and the rest of the moderators find truly amazing. 

As a result of the very much rising population, but seemed to have been slightly lost leading to the mindset that Elitism is a core part of /r/teslore, something that is completely untrue. What I'm getting at is that I'm thankful that we are currently as a subreddit restoring the non-elitist aspect of the subreddit and letting in newcomers with open arms, which is awesome. Thank you for that, and keep on doing it. 

Other than that we have a had a great week. Lots of activity, including [The Common Khajiiti Mindset about Assimilation into Tamrielic culture by Mr_Flippers](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/14l8r9/the_common_khajiit_mindset_and_the_assimilation/), [Role of the Blades leading up to the events of Skyrim by Dbcification](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/14ojmd/the_role_of_the_bladesinhiding_leading_up_to_the/), and [Alternative View of the Tribunal by Strangeloup](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/14uixx/an_alternate_view_of_the_tribunal/)

Thank you for posting everyone, so we are sorry if you found your comment was removed. I'd like to just remind everyone again that posting and commenting in the subreddit itself is strictly lore related. The Community itself has *many* places to go for more casual and fun activity, including the community threads and the IRC (Which I am quite pissed off that no one uses. C'mon guys, Prince and I always feel lonely there. Join us.) as well as many smaller subreddits created by the community for the community. These smaller subreddits do serve a large role in the community, so it is important to mention and advertise them. To check those out you can go down in the sidebar. I've also been asked by Myrr to announce that he and some others plan on upgrading and using the network of so-far inactive race subreddits. Subreddits such as /r/argonians, /r/khajiits, and /r/orsimer suffer from almost complete inactivity. If the members of teslore could use these and populate them with good discussion and fun roleplaying

With all things needed to be said aside

**Scholar of the Week**

This week was very hard to judge. The distribution of activity was pretty much evened out with all the scholars, a user that stood out to me in activity was *Shonni-Et*. With seemingly twice the amount of the normal scholar this week, it seems only logical to give Shonni the award. Thanks for the activity, Shonni, and keep on posting!

---

That is all I have to say for this week. Remember that the part I write in the Weekly Thread is supposed to be only half of it, I am interested.

That is all. Thank you for posting and commenting, and have a great week.

**Aetherius**

Aetherius is the home of the Magne-Ge. The Magne-Ge being the Aedra who followed Magnus and fled Mundus before being killed in it's creation. Aetherius is the originplace of Magicka and is a hotbed of Magne-Ge politics. 

**The Aedra**

The Aedra are the Et'Ada who aided Lorkhan in the creation of Mundus and gave their immortality to the creation of Mundus. Some became the Ehlnofey, whilst others became the Earthbones, the laws of Natures. The most powerful ones however became the Plane(t)s, as can be seen here:

http://www.uesp.net/wiki/File:OB_Orrery_Planet_Names.jpg

Some argue that the Divines are dead and that what we see are just the echoes of them but in my opinion that's a non-point since it doesn't really matter either way because it doesn't change anything at all.

**The Aedric Realms**

We've never heard of any realm of the Aedra (except Sovngarde) and priests of Arkay commend the dead's souls to Aetherius. This leads me to believe that there is no such thing as an Aedric Realm and the souls of good and pious Imperials get sent straight into the Dreamsleeve.

**The Dreamsleeve**

The Dreamsleeve is the recycling system of souls. It is supposedly part of Aetherius but has also been said to be a part of Mundus

&gt; We mortals leave the dreaming-sleeve of birth the same

**The Daedric Realms**

Those souls who have bound themselves to a specific Daedric Lord go to their Plane upon death. There they serve their Prince for eternity.

**Sovngarde**

Is the realm of Shor, sounds the most interesting of current theories but seeing as Bethesda hasn't said where Sovngarde is we can't really say.

With all that said and done may I suggest a clean-up of UESP and ES wikia so that they no longer say Sovngarde is in Aetherius.

*During a battle between the Ehlnofex armies, N'Gyre, as he called himself, and he watched briefly as N'Gyre began to raise up the broken bodies of his comrades.*

*At this most foul of injustices, ""Look at this, what atrocities you have committed! All this evil done with impunity, and a clear conscience on your part! You should bear the shame of a thousand betraying soldiers, for you fight not only through the use of others' power, but with the power of your own comrades!""*

*Hearing the rebuke, ""Trinimac, you may be the Champion God of Lord Auri-El, but when you have passed your usefulness and begin to wither, there shall I stand, ready to rekindle the flame of your passion, but with my own choice fuel, and you will serve me on bended knee.""*

*Trinimac, and it was given. During the next battle, Trinimac found the Necromancer near the Coast and, before the Necromancer could successfully cast his spell, brought down all the might and rage of his great blade and slew N'Gyre. The strike of Trinimac's blade coupled with the energy of N'Gyre's charging spell sundered his body into many pieces, but the largest parts were cast into the Western Sea by Trinimac.*

*After Trinimac had departed, a vile, cruel, and proud race was born, the Sload. The pieces of N'Gyre that were too small to sink became the islands of the Coral Kingdom of Thras, and the energy of N'Gyre and his final spell lingered on, infusing necromantic power in each of the Sload from birth. They worshipped only N'Gyre, like Namira and Peryite and Molag Bal

1348107065.0,106664,Stone of Snow Throat,AnarchyMoose,25,2,35,"This is just a pet theory of mine that I’ve been thinking about since the Convention 2.0 Thread. Also

Currently, were built by Elves, correct? Orihalc built by the Left-Handed Elves, Crystal-Like-Law built by the Aldmer/Altmer, White-Gold built by the Ayleids, ect. We also know that the Snow Elves, or the civilization that became the Snow Elves, we still do not know the stone of Snow-Throat

So, Paarthurnax, the Nords, and the Eye of Magnus. I will strike each of these down, respectively.

* 1)	Alduin: Alduin sole purpose for even existing is to eat and destroy Mundus and all of creation to end the Kalpa. It doesn’t make any sense whatsoever for him to be a major force that is preserving Mundus.

* 2)	Paarthurnax: The PC is TES V: Skyrim has the choice to kill him. Which means he is expected to survive in some play-throughs of the game. If there is even a possibility for a Stone to remain intact or destroyed

* 3)	The Nords: The Snow Elves activated Snow-Throat before they even knew of the existence of the Nords

* 4)	The Eye of Magnus: This is the most likely of the common theories. But according to KIMMUNE, mining robot. This makes it unlikely that it is a stone.

Good. Now that we have got that out of the way, never wasting time on actually building the Tower.
 
The lack of building time leads me to believe that Snow-Throat was one of the first, if the Snow Elves understood the process better, what’s stopping them from experimenting with the Stone? After all, they didn’t even have to worry about building the Tower. They could’ve taken all the time they needed to research how to make their Stone stronger than any physical substance. Something that is stronger than a substance is a concept.
 
We know that at least one kind of concept be made into a Stone. We see that with Convention. And lilrhys has basically proven that Convention was not just a onetime thing. It can be repeated. And the Elves’ God-King ascended with the aid of convention
 
Time is a very strong force. It’s practically invincible. It is closely associated with their chief deity

More importantly, the Dovahkiin used the same Elder Scroll on the exact same spot where time was weakened to view something from the past. This probably shattered Time, and with it, the Stone of Snow-Throat.

The main thing I like about this theory

Also, it probably can’t be completely destroyed without destroying Akatosh himself

A travel Guide to Oblivion

Written by Dovahkiin42


[1] On Oblivion
	
When I talk about Oblivion in this guide, as well as the otherwise considered “outer realms.” While little is known about the other Outer Realms, the basic travel concepts to get there can be the same as those to oblivion. Oblivion is a hostile and strange land. Many of the realms are inhabited by daedra, even an individual daedroth can be a formidable foe. First you will need to be accurately prepared. I recommend making sure that you are well trained in the combat magics for this purpose. However overall Alteration and Conjuration are what will get you to Oblivion. 

[2] Getting there and back safely.

[2.1] There are many who have claimed to have walked oblivion before. From the Hero of Kvatch to the ancient
 Dwemer
 Sil, and begin to be
 there
 dead
Thras is said to be one
 obtaining a sigil stone and making a pact with a daedric prince (I will talk about which princes I do and do not 
recommend)

[2.2] Before we begin, and many of the realms you travel to will require complex breathing, warding, and levitation spells. Teleportation is a good idea to be familiar with as well. 
		

Now
 the Telvanni method. The Telvanni method will first require you to contact a prestigious member of the Telvanni house. I recommend the head of the house

The next method I am more familiar with. It involves a sigil stone. There are several ways to get a full blown sigil stone, sitting on a four square table, and from dawn to dusk of the same day you must speak incantations over the stone. Then you take the purified morpholith and summon a daedric prince. The prince then can inscribe the stone, and you have a sigil stone (my apologies, I am going to step out of book writing mode now and apologize; I had the book open in the morning, however now I can't give you further reading on the subject in this volume). 

A third option would to directly summon a daedric prince, or that of the sigil stone because you could take a whole party of adventurers to improve safety.

[2.3] There are many things that you need to be cautious of while travelling to oblivion. I recommend that you 
only deal with one of the following princes: Sheogorath, Sanguine, and Meridia. I recommend 
Sheogorath because of the known safety of his realm. It is decently well protected by the mad god
be very careful trying not to go insane. Having a large group with you would be helpful here.


Azura is known to be one of the princes that is not completely evil. A warning to her realm though,” however it appears that her realm has been sealed after the trial of Vivec, and mages have been unable to travel there. Jyggalag seems to be an interesting daedric prince, he was expelled by the other daedra because of his great power. He is the prince of order, and I personally think that meeting him is a relatively safe endeavour compared to attempting to meet with Mehrunes Dagon or others. Caution should be taken when finding his realm however, little to none is known about his native plane. Sanguine is known to have treated mortals well in the past, beware his realms, little is known about her

[3] Dangers of Oblivion
1. Make sure to have skill in levitation

2. Have knowledge in conjuration
3. Be wary of the daedric princes
	
There are a wide variety of daedric realms that you need to concern yourself with, the nirn based conjuror could summon you unbound adventurer and all will be well. In order for this to work you will need to develop a psychic relationship with the other person. Several notable groups have developed this, including the Dwemer and Psijics. Each realm has dangers. Perhaps I will write a sequel that contains the dangers of each major plane. 

---

Authors note: there are some experiments and miscellaneous things that I would like you to try when you reach oblivion. They are: try summoning someone on nirn to Oblivion as they would summon you to nirn, If you have another way to reach oblivion, please write me with details and I will put it in the edit, If you find a way to create your own plane of oblivion contact me and I will work on a guide.",,False,,1374351029.0,t3_1ij8e1

Welcome to yet another Weekly Community Thread. Partly in order to insure that you read through the entire thread and partly (upon Mr. Boeathia's command) to torment you as much as possible, do read the entire thread, don't just scroll down to the announcement. If you do it will put a big hearty smile on my face.

**Weekly Summary**

I have to say this week was very enjoyable as it was one of the most active weeks I remember us having to this date. With almost two pages of threads, but it's fine since you guys will get plenty of those when the 12,000 scholars mark rolls around. 

In addition to the activity we have also gotten a fresh wave of new scholars, make sure once again that you have read through the sidebar and the New Scholar's Guide to the Subreddit, as well as the FAQ before you start posting. Make special notice to re-read the voting guidelines even if you have already done so.


**Scholar of the Week**

This week's scholar of the week is new to the title, Asotil, hopefully the others in the SOTW hall of fame can welcome you warmly.

**Announcement**

As you all probably know, /u/anonymous_mononymous, and /u/OccupyTamriel. After seeing some comment support in the original thread, we decided to put the voting down to a poll, to which we have gotten over a hundred votes (more than last time)

Out of those votes, meaning we will use him as our personal comment-removal servant for a while before letting him actually do anything else, it should go pretty well.

As for the other candidates, I believe all three of you would have made equally great additions to the moderation team, but the community decides what it decides.

That's pretty much it for this week

(Foundational document of old-as-earth Altmeri edaphological philothea




[Dear love


The dawn is beautiful, is beautiful. So often we deny that. So often I have denied that. Or not seen it. But the dew is beautiful. The dew is beautiful.



I wanted to write this letter because I have something to share with you. We get to share so few things in this world. I didn’t always care – I didn’t always want to share. I ran away. I ran away from the earth of my life and learned of other horizons, and I only knew it when you brought it back to me. You gave me all the worlds of Not and taught me the joy of their present absence without doing anything at all. I want to give that back, if I can. I want to give you what I feel.



There’s no guarantee that I can. I’m not sure that it will work. I’m not sure the answer that has found me these last few months will be anything new to you. Maybe you found this long ago. Maybe you never forgot it. Maybe it has no merit at all. I do not know. I am as uncertain of this as I am of everything in life – and I am uncertain of everything in life. Everything I have learned from you in the last decade distills to this: I know nothing. Even about myself, assured in refusal of your world? Or does your every opinion ring false in your own ears, as do mine in my own, undercut by understanding? 



I see your skeptical eyebrow, and like all tools issues only the product of its wielder's skill and resources. Logic is promiscuous; it invests validity in contradictory stances. I have no confidence in debate, although I engage in it. I am not certain of anything... not even the truth of that statement. I – I am not even sure that I should send this letter. It seems – presumptuous. Arrogant and foolish. But this feeling - it is all the richness of possibility compressed to a single point of poignance. How could I not want to share that with you? How could I not try to give that to you? So I do it, though I am not sure that I should.



It may seem strange. I, I am neither loner nor lonely. [Solitude, like the solar, is food, just as togetherness is food, for they are only truly different in gradient](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrGEyk5Mp2g). We are all many people; to be alone is to be with our Selves. Solitude is only subgradient togetherness; togetherness is only shared solitude. And as I have feasted upon solitude, now I wish to share. So, but feel much.



[So often we live in dreams](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIeLeIwwpHc). We see so many things that could be, cherish them, treasure them up, and mourn them when they seem to pass irretrievably into impossibility. Sometimes it seems that they aren’t worth it. To see so much beauty and experience so little of it is unendingly painful. I used to think that there could be no love without pain, pain came so often. When you drained the blood from my affection and offered only the dust of the dead in return, there has been pain. When you could not accept disparity, there has been pain. When you held back, even though all I wanted was to be there for you where there had been no one for me



But not all the world remembers its tragedy. So many choose amnesia. And sometimes even we would rather forget it, that we should rather feel nothing than endure this absence.



But I have tried that, although unreal, the things for which we yearn are *actually present* in our longing. Shared solitudes that *are Not* enter into us, and we know them by the void their presence presses into our hearts. The fullness of the presence of absence is what makes the tears flow in the dark, not pain. The intimacy of our missing dreams fills us, fills us to overflowing, and when we cry with longing



That is not pain. That is beauty. That is the kiss of the missing. That is the condensation of possibility; that is the dew of dawn. [Your tears are the golden dew of dawn](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F29AOOgvVOU). When I think of life without that – when I think of what my life would be without our shared solitude rearing mountains in my heart, without the fur of n-plus-one-pets-needed Nell on our skin, without these long nights of longing, these long nights of longing for love and longing to give you these riches I cannot appreciate - ah, my love, my love, that is when I feel absence. That is emptiness



I once told you that I would not miss you – not out of cruelty, I have learned to miss, my love, and I have learned to love missing. And I miss you.



I have to. I have to remember, I have to miss you, because in missing you, I have you. [For even to think of you is golden](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShFer_hFZxs). I have to live like this - missing, yearning, longing, wanting you *so much* – because it keeps you with me when you are gone. And you are always in some measure gone.



This is the most important part. There is so much pain and separation in this world; even the most intimate of friends never truly touch. [And we long to, holding to the fragments of our first memory of intimacy, our first shared solitude, our nascent dawn to this world. But if we ever want to touch, if we ever want to feel that dawn again, then we have to live like this. We have to cry, we have to miss, because our memories of intimacy entangle reality.



But I hold no confidence that my telling can convince those who are forged, as I was, those who are weary, as I was. That will not give you what I feel. You must feel it yourself. It is not enough to speak of what can be done; we must also speak of how.



It is very easy. Simply ask. Simply wonder. Simply say 'I do not know.'



Confusion is the key. Love lasts only as long as we approach our beloved. We must yearn toward them. [Love is the perpetual approach](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYAn6bMgqVs); we cease to love when we stop going to our beloved. When we think we know our loves discretely, we stop coming closer to them - for why should we strive toward what we think we already have? It is such an easy thing to fall into. But love is understanding, and to understand is to become: a process. It is the reconstruction of pattern, not pattern's presence. We are all waves of diachronic identity - oscillating, infinitive, inexact - and those we love are our functional asymptotes. We perpetually approximate our beloved. But when we choose the evaluation of certainty, when we think we know, to practice confusion opens us to possibility



Put technically:



*The limit of correlation between the real and the unreal is the degree of the system’s uncertainty.*



This is the boundary of possibility: the less we know, the more we can kiss the missing. The less we know, the more we can love.



See it thus: Uncertainty is the seat of understanding. Confusion is the throne of love.



And when you sit in that seat the feeling comes. When you practice confusion absence becomes present; then comes the indwelling of the unreal. It is the taste of lemon and butterscotch. It is the feeling of a too-large idea stretching your skull in the night. It is the welling of saliva. It is the catch of your throat in a sob. It is your mouth filled with earth. It is dew. It is the cusp of orgasm given gravidity. It is the kiss of the missing. It is the sound of a swallowed syllable. And that is the only name I have found for it: NM; the acronym of our starry browed merge-Masters; the swallowed syllable



I don't know if you want this. I don't know if NM will be as powerful for you as it has been for me. I don't know if this is what you would want me to do. I had to try, though, it is done. I have told you what I have to tell, and shown you what I have to show. It is up to you to accept the gift, if you will. 



If you will, remember that it is not pain you feel but fullness. If you long for hug after hug after hug, as I do, if you yearn for a kiss in the night, as I do, if you hope for what can never be, as I do, as I do



If you cry for what is Not, and the dew of dawn.



If life sunders you from the sharers of your solitude



And if ever you miss me

**Goblin Anatomy**

Goblin are short stout creatures, typically consisting of make-shift pieces scavenge from their kills. Their leaders strength however, allows them to fight with heavier weapons.

Rieklings are of similar skeletal structure and I theorize that they are related. Examination reveals a remarkably similar cranial structure. To support my hypothesis, but are sometimes referred to as “snow goblins”. I believe both of these races are devolved Mer of some sort.

Whilst orcs

**Behaviour**

Goblins exhibit a hostile behaviour, indicating that they have some notion of currency. Goblins normally band into tribes which war over their totems. One of the most famous is the war between the Rock Biters and the Bloody Hands of Cyrodil. The Rock Biters stole the Bloody Hand's totem. The war ended after the death of the Bloody Hand shaman or the returning of the staff. This allowed the settling of Cropsford.

Their religion is unknown. The shamans show some form of worship, is unknown. Malacath, the corrupted form of the Mer, Trinimac (I believe), is considered a patron god of the ostracised, including the Goblin-ken. The warring over the possession of the staffs is intriguing.

The tribes themselves are formed of different types of foot-soldiers, and a war chief. Sometimes the tribe is lead by an ogre. Goblins seem to communicate through high-pitched squeals. Goblins can also tame Durzogs. Some argue that the Durzogs are more intelligent than the goblins.

The third edition of Pocket Guide to the Empire states that the Aldmer kept goblins and other Goblin-ken as slaves. After being freed

**Distribution**

Goblins are found all over Tamriel, only emerging to hunt. Some have been found roaming the sewers, feeding on skeevers. Perhaps centuries of being shunned has led them to hide underground.

From your humble servant and friend


It has been a long while indeed since my last letter. I trust this one shall find you in good health? Old Mede isn't working you too hard

I may have stumbled on something quite intriguing indeed, or think I've learned, won't make very many citizens happy indeed. Still, I owe it to you to report back, as you graciously continue to finance my journey. 

Where to begin? I've learned so much, but I suppose the finder of hidden truth is exempt from such things. But enough beating around the bush (what a curious phrase, I quite enjoy it). On to the heart of the subject.

I was walking through the Great Pine Forest of southern Skyrim recently. It's quite beautiful, as I said, I was walking through the forest, and I came upon a glade. The common tongue doesn't quite have a phrase for its beauty, and my own tongue would not translate to paper well, but suffice it to say, it was the single most breath-taking sight my humble eyes have ever taken in. Simply wonderful. 

There was a lovely little pond where tiny fish swam about doing fish things, I believe it had, and again, the weaknesses of language confound us, for I cannot render its name here. I shall have to speak it to you when we meet face-to-face again, for it is most lovely. 

Back to the glade, and I felt like singing. 

Unfortunately for me, much to my surprise. I heard the hunters in the quaint little lodge I stayed at after this business was concluded call it a Spriggan when I recounted my tale to them, so I suppose that's what it was. A fair forest nymph it appeared to me, though it began to attack me, believing me a threat. It was no animal, of that I am sure, for there is no beast in all of Skyrim that would attack a lover of the forest like myself unprovoked. This Spriggan, came at me

I cast the poor creature down there, only to notice some small details that sparked my curiosity. Its limbs looked as though they were bones and roots, bones like those of any man or mer, and roots of, well, trees. Its head was crowned with branches that whistled with the sound of winds long gone, and its face was radiant with beauty. Truly it rivaled even that of this glade it defended!

As I stooped over it and studied

I was lying along the side of the road, though I suppose she was Breton, for her face had elven grace to it mixed with the rough dependability of the Nords. She was garbed in the vestments of the Temple of Mara far off in Riften, and reached her hand down to pull me up. After getting me to my feet, she gave me a robe from her pack, for it seemed she had traveled somewhere on Temple business, and was returning back that way.

I tried to question her on what happened, and reached a dusty little village, near the border with Cyrodiil. I purchased a room and retired for the night. While I slept, I dreamed, and this dream seemed for all the world to be real, perhaps the most real thing I'd encountered on this long journey of mine.

I dreamed I was watching myself stand over the fallen Spriggan. I saw the hand shoot up to my throat

Then, but we all have in us the nature of every beast and creature to ever roam this world, and many who have not yet done so. We only use this power in times of great need, for we swore an oath to restrain this great and evil power we have to our greatest patron, the god Y'ffre. He made with us a great Pact, of which I will not speak further for now. But, back to the dream.

Yes. I lost control of my body, as dawn broke, it emerged onto the road, where I saw the priestess when I woke up. Only the priestess was not who I saw.

I saw the most radiant woman imaginable, and she commanded me to stop in a loud voice. She bade me change no more, and return to my original form. And my body obeyed.

...it seems clear to me now that the woman I met on the road was none other than Kyne

This leads me to the first, and is also Kynareth, the lady of the air. This much is known. But, after my strange encounter, I believe that Kyne is Y'ffre, or Y'ffre is Kyne, or perhaps they are each other, but oddly fitting

My second learning, my mind turned to our sacred Pact with Y'ffre. None live who remember all of it, but consider this: love of nature is common among Bosmer. What better way to love and commune with nature than to become it? I think that sometime in the forgotten past, Bosmeri maidens invoked Y'ffre, and begged to be one with nature. Y'ffre took pity on them, and changed their form. I believe these maidens, formerly my kin, not just our homeland's forests

As an aside

I gladly rid myself of these troubling thoughts now, I shall have more soon enough. May the gods, whose names may change, but whose natures never shall, keep you in good health and in good standing with all you meet.

I leave this letter in your capable hands

**Weekly Recap**

This week we have seen a mix of general question-discussion from the influx of new members, [""From the deserts of rust and wounds to Camoran's paradise"" a translation and interpretation of the Mysterium Xarxes by Rileyman360](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/15gbha/from_the_deserts_of_rust_and_wounds_to_camorans/), [A Boy and his Dog by Voryn](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/15g8qz/a_boy_and_his_dog/) and [Virtue, Ever Watchful: Part the Seventh- Deceit by Dbcification](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/15f1bx/virtue_everwatchful_part_the_seventh_deceit_merry/). All great threads this week. 

So in overall, and many new scholars. Everything good and joyous. Except one small thing. We have been getting a very underwhelming amount of votes for the [Best of 2012 poll](http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/WPP55CK). Which makes Rhys and I very sad. So, let's stress this more:

**Scholar of the Week**

Our scholar of the week this week has far too much activity to pass over. Aside from basically running the TSG/TAG subreddits, he's going to complain that he got the title, that selfless bastard, but that's okay. He still got it. Congratulations, [Myrrlyn](http://www.reddit.com/user/myrrlyn), keep at it, and thanks for the continued activity. Also this may or may not have to do with the fact he got me Reddit Gold. I'm corrupt like that

That's all I have to say this week. Once again

If you are a new scholar

And

If you are a lurker and have not shown any actual activity, too.

Other than that feel free to tell me about your week and provide any feedback you have for the mods

That's all I have to say. Keep on posting everyone

**A boy and his dog**


Many an end and beginning ago
There once was a boy and his dog
one day strolling by a log
far from the village and through the fog.

shortly acquainted
the two had saved each other from many ends
but from what came next
of no vigil nor valiance had they been blest

for a thing not quite man and not quite wolf
leapt forth, and gripped the dog.
And in bloody strife
But for the sun

Wrapped in interim of far night and early day
the boy weeped
At this bitter misfortune he mourned and lamented as the dog ebbed to his final dusk.
He cried and begged for any and all gods unravel this callous end.
No peace came from beyond the stars
Save one

""Forsooth terrible was the misfortune that coerced you here.
Your agony I know
for nothing but a single condition

The boy knew of the voice
Old and mischevious and dispassionate.
Save for its lust of mischief.


Betwixt pain and grief
""From dusk to dawn shall he be?""
""And more
hindrance and vexation to your every doing.""

First by pain and grief
and soon by powers beyond belief
shall the boy's judgement ever be veiled.
Readily he agreed
heart brimming with joy
his soul defiled to the very crux.

With every heart-beat didst the dog grow warmer
and the boy
For none too soon were they home
that the boy developped a taste for devilry.
So much so that he relished it with great gusto.
Yet as the word of daedroth stated
the dog always attempted to halt what the boy plotted.

So did it go
And for many years did this persist
Early was it that the fisherman cursed the bear for his interfering
so it was his door unlocked and honey trailed up to his bed
Fortune or mis was it that the tax-collector's bag bled?
Or that the lumber-jacks before tree-wives had fled?

Keener didst the boy's mind grow
ears athirst for knowledge
eyes hungering for happenstance
and many gardens of misery did he tend
with the dog as his sole torment.

Wily and insidious was now the boy.
So saturated and enraptured by his work
that the dog's rescuer had come with an offer.

Delighted and engrossed with the boy
the daedroth offered him a place by his side
to do as he does,  and by all the five corners.


The boy pondered but knew
the voice cackled and seemed to grin behind its star-void veil;
""trifle and trivial, is take the dog too,
forever to be a part of you"".


Flustered and rattled
But soon with a frown-cloaked-smile
and so stood he then


Not for a day did he linger
and swiftly he came to every prayer.
Whether cursed or praised
replacing and usurping his master's fame

But also higher now than normal man
the dog enjoyed a new consciousness
and weaving reason into his own canvas.
He knew to not now trouble the boy
for he knew his ambition
and better was he for that which was his intention.
All the dog could bring was admonition

The boy toiled diligently
weaving lies of his power wedded to promises of rewards
but for loyalty and the dissemination of his name

And soon
was the one recognized as lord of wishes.
Too late did the prince realize
the boy's power exceeded his own.

So it is said that the boy tore out the face of the quondam prince
and claimed it and plane and power as his own.

Prince unto void
Boy unto prince

1354165786.0,13z8w5,The Dreamsleeve as a Means of Communication,Ishullanu,24,1,14,"

 The Dreamsleeve as we currently understand it has two seemingly unrelated functions. Mainly it serves as a mechanism for recycling the mortal souls of Nirn, and finally how the mages could be accessing it.

 For the Dreamsleeve to serve its purpose of reincarnation it must be able to both take in and let out souls anywhere in Mundus. It would need to be accessible under nearly all circumstances, reentering the world at the exact intended destination.

So the benefits of Dreamsleeve messaging are clear, considering the amount of power (soul energy) and knowledge (purged memories) that consistently pass through there. For a mage to use the Dreamsleeve it would be logical to assume they would mimic the natural conditions of something passing into it, specifically with death. 

Now as with most magical processes, the death symbolism coming from the loss of the unique composition from one’s mind, for it to appear reincarnated in another’s. Obviously, it is not know if these rituals would be enough to penetrate into the Dreamsleeve system, more direct approaches may be necessary with unpleasant implications. 

The most plausible way to access the Dreamsleeve for communication is to bind the missive directly to an unremarkable mortal’s soul, but there are surely situations where the cost of a life is worth the ability to send information that is guaranteed to be unimpeded. Additionally this introduces the inherent danger of combining necromantic magicks with one of the main life sustaining phenomena in Mundus.  Whatever their methodology may be let us all hope those who are using the Dreamsleeve for correspondence are doing so inhabitually and with great caution. ",,False,,t5_2t5ay,False,Winterhold,

* Why do the patterns of exit wounds play a role in personalities and traits?

* What determine's a specific constellation's ""selection?"" For one to be born under a certain sign

* Given that Mundus is Nirncentric rather than Magnecentric

This last question led me to what I currently believe to be the case

[Begin Conjecture] (/g) We've discussed the sky; the nightblack are all the overlapping realms of Oblivion, that they are shapeless and unknowable and the filter of the mortal mind makes them appear to us as spherical bodies, for the sphere is the quintessential Anuic shape. Given that the planets follow the Mundane equivalent of solar mechanics, I believe that there ARE in fact rocks in the space beyond the atmosphere of Nirn, and that they are simply tied metaphysically to their Aedra. Can we not say the same for the sun and stars? Can the sun not be a light originally installed by Magnus (whether or not it's a flaming ball of fusion is really irrelevant here, IMHO) and that it was linked to him in his flight? His portal is at once everywhere and nowhere and incomprehensible to our finite minds, but it is linked so strongly to the sun that it is both at once? Thus I hold that there IS a light circling Mundus, and the sun and planets and the star-rim move independently (as seen in-game).

So building off my premise that the stars do physically exist, and hold ideas, traits, and tendencies within them. The constellations thus serve to add variety to the lives of Nirn's inhabitants by linking them to those born under them, slightly pushing their attached mortals along thirteen different paths.
