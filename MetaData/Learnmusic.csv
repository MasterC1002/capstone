1264868460.0,aw2o6,IAMA Voice teacher continuation - Vocal warm ups and exercises.,jeconti,65,7,10,"*Protip* – These exercises are best done in front of a mirror so you can check out all the physiological happenings as you do it. **Singing is first and foremost a physical activity.**

**Breathing -**

Stand against a wall. Your feet should be about shoulder width apart

Your ribcage will then rise and move outwards. This is creating additional room for your lungs to expand. Don't confuse this with your shoulder. They'll come up a little naturally just because of your ribs

When all is said and done, and your posture should be akin to someone pulling your head up by a string attached right at the top.

Now that you have air in your lungs, then exhale completely. If you do this right, once you push all of your air out, you shouldn't have to do anything to inhale. The vacuum created in your lungs will just fill with air.

Repeat the process

*Tips:* When you inhale

**Yawn Sirens -**

Force yourself to yawn. You feel that giant space in the back of your mouth? That's your soft palate stretching. If you run your tongue along the roof of your mouth, you create a big space for your voice to resonate.

With that big space in back in mind, come up a little, then back down, then up a little higher, then back down a little less, then a little higher, etc. until you reach the top.

**Other non-pitch specific warm ups -**

Two words: Nada and Hey

Inhale just like we were doing before, or start high and go lower, or just do it randomly.

When you say “Hey”

When you say “Nada”

**Range Work -**

Okay, I assume you know I'm referring to a major scale, and that you know what it sounds like. I'm going to start talking actual pitches, and some more musical stuff.

If I have assumed too much for you

American's suck at vowels. Hard. So the biggest challenge I have when working with kids in choir is getting them to use singing vowels

[a] as in F**a**ther, [o] as in h**o**pe, [u] as in sp**oo**n

Americans suck because we don't pronounce any of these vowels singularly. For most, and then close to an oo sound? Don't do that either. For these vocal exercises we want only pure vowels.

**Lower range extension** -

Start in the middle of your range on a random pitch (I usually start on the Eb below middle C for a baritone). Start on Sol and sing down five notes, Mi, Re, Do. Sing this line on an [i] vowel. Repeat again, going down by half steps every time until it stops sounding like singing and more like burping.

The vowel has a forward placement, especially guys, going lower in your range will cause your placement to fall back into your throat. That create a very dark and swallowed sound. It also creates jaw tension which doesn't allow for free and easy singing.

**Upper range extension** - 

Start again in the middle of your range

Try and find a constant rhythm to do it in. The best way I can really explain it is using some basic theory. In 6/8

On the first three notes, the more air it will require to make the notes come out. When it starts to feel really high, bend your knees when you hit the top note and visualize the sound exploding out of the top of your head.

Alright, and I'm sure some of it is confusing. I will try and get the microphone out and record some examples this weekend.

I invite all of you to pick a song you are currently working on and think about how you are approaching it.  What do you do with it every day?  Do you play from beginning to end a couple of times and then move on to another song?  It's very easy to sit down day after day and play the same song the same way.  You go from beginning to end, ""Oh that sounded pretty good.""  How many of you have done that?

**The secret to effective practicing is in finding all of your trouble spots and working through them until they aren't trouble spots anymore.**  It sounds very simple and it is

* Play through the song.  Mark any place you have any trouble. 
* Play through the song again with a metronome.  Listen carefully and mark any places where the rhythm fluctuates. 
* Play through the song again and record yourself.  Play back the recording and find out if you are really hearing what you think you're hearing.  Mark down any trouble spots. 
* Have someone else listen to you play the song and point out trouble spots.

In my lessons, I emphasize correct technique and other things, but one of those rather ""elusive"" areas of teaching music can be sight reading. I've been experimenting with various pedagogical approaches to sight reading

Most method books procede in gradual increments of difficulty. So, look for patterns, etc.). This is pretty helpful, but it isn't producing ""success"" in sight reading - and by success, I mean accurate performance of material the very first time. 

So, because we flip a few pages back in the book and try another excerpt of material. Still there are mistakes but far fewer mistakes than before. We flip a few more pages back, and boom! Success! First reading, perfectly performed.

And so I'm posting this here to offer some advice to DIY's learning music and how to sight read. Shoot for difficult material first, because you need to do this and get it out of the way. Go to something a little easier, again, do your best and read your way through it without stopping. Continue this process until you start nailing your material the first time without mistakes. 

Of course, ""Here, let's try this one now."" Again, I never thought this approach would work for my students, but I'm finding more success with this than anything else I've tried so far. Good luck!

1322726846.0,mvxbj,"So Rocksmith is fucking awesome... (as a ""game"" and a learning tool)",,26,4,13,"Ok so if you hadn't heard

Here's the [list of songs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocksmith)

[GiantBomb](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=o5UQf4iyVv8#t=371s) does a great hour-long QuickLook at it.

Anyway

Now I also have the [Rock band 3 pro fender midi guitar](http://www.rockband.com/blog/rb3-features-pro-guitar) but the thing Rocksmith has over that is the actual note charts/tabs. Rocksmith's is a lot easier to make sense of than RB3's. That is much better for a beginner like me. Plus since your console is acting like an amp/DSP thingy, and I had some issues since it was more of a fight of plucking just right and making sure you had the exact finger positions to make contact with the MIDI guitar's electronic fretboard. 

The other advantage is there is no difficulty selection. The songs are chopped into sections/riffs ala RB/GH, and I was playing [Queens of the Stoneage](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=xYY-GbjEduE) and it was so fun and rewarding watching the game add more notes to each measure as it got good at the song. See the blue and orange boxes at the top of the screen? they start out as empty boxes that fill up as you correctly play the song. It starts with just one note/pluck per measure (or every other measure) and soon after a few tries at the song, you're playing all 16th's with the chords in there too. That looks daunting but I can't find any videos of people playing beginner level stuff.

There's also little arcade games that help you with basic techniques that make stuff like [scales](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=jYzUMdxzzaw) and [chords](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=dv9gFyC-00s) fun to work on.

It also doesn't punish you (that I could tell) for playing wrong notes, so there is a way to track your progress and gamify your practice at a song. My roommate has played guitar for a long time, and knows [House of the Rising Sun](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=pt8vZIIrfmg), and he's pumping out the chords and stuff even though the game is just sending him a few notes. By the end of the song he was getting chords thrown at him so the game adjusts very well to your skill. (there is also an option in the settings to reset the difficulty of all songs to minimum, or set it to maximum if you are already a pro heh)

Similar to RB3, HOPOS and such, with bronze/silver/gold medals for you to unlock pedals and amps with and stuff.

Annoyances:

* You can select a song and see it's basic chord structure, not long enough to justify the load time. There's a chord book in the game you can look at however.  

* I wish the song selection was a little more varied. Half seems to be California indie rock by bands I've never heard of. A quarter is classic rock and the other quarter is alt rock. There is no metal

* It comes with a little poster saying you shouldn't play with HDMI audio since it introduces a delay. This was fixable in RB3 and such, so your audio isn't delayed (video can still be HDMI, and ingame is a video lag compensator like RB/GH)



That's about it. Here I am 2am blabbing about this game I just spent 3 or 4 hours with (It just arrived today) and all this time I could have played Skyrim! ;)

Retail is $79 for game and cable but on Black Friday I was able to get it for $49 from Gamestop. Still totally worth it. There's even a 200$ bundle that includes a guitar

I dunno what's making me want to keep playing this. I think it's the *actual* audio feedback that helps

**Some history**

I have been playing guitar now for 5 years or somewhat without any understanding of music theory and in those years I learned to play songs with TABS and also jammed a lot with trial and error. I can say I have a decent feel for music and my hand dexterity is pretty good.

**What I have done so far**

So this year I set a goal to be able to produce music and to be able to enjoy the whole process of it effortlessly

**1)** I bought myself a MIDI piano and learned to play some songs through memorising. This is my preferred learning way and I've been able to pick up quickly.


**2)** Starting hitting the books and gained insight on general music theory (notation, basic song structures). I have a pretty solid understanding of what they 
mean


**3)** Considering that I want to produce electronic music, oscillators and whatnot and starting playing around with a copy of Native Instruments' FM8 I purchased.

**4)** I have explored the ins and outs of Logic Pro

**Problems I have run into**

**1)** I can't seem to finish any song I work on. I am always dissatisfied in the end and flip everything around leaving a mess. I seem to look for something and the problem is that I have no clue what it is.

**1a)** So okay, but the song in itself sounds too static and I have no clue how to bring dynamic into play. Basically, I'm struggling to finish a song into a whole piece. 

**1b)** It seems that all the instruments don't sound right when put them together but when played individually, I'm just not satisfied.

**2)** Mastering.. I just have no clue

Now I know music basically has no rules but I feel there is a common skill that can be learned (perhaps I'm all wrong). I hope I am not coming across too whiny (sorry for the long post!!)


My mind is too scattered


I think I'm too ignorant but I am very willing to learn! please give me some helpful insights so I can go back to work confidently!

I have been using the functional ear trainer from miles.be to try to learn to hear the scale degrees of notes.

My goal is to be able to listen to a piece of music and be able to determine which notes and chords are being played so that I can play whatever I hear in my head on the piano.

I have quickly gotten to the point where I am able to get 100% on functional ear trainer (it plays a cadence and then a note) but it takes me a 'moment' (maybe like a second) to think of the answer. When I listen to a simple melody playback I can't figure out the notes. I believe that this might be because I don't know where 'do' is or maybe because it's too fast. If I hum the melody to myself tone by tone I can sometimes figure it out.

Can you please suggest the next step for me or recount how you gained your enhanced hearing?

1) she just isn't a natural at music. She loves music to death

2) She doesn't have time to perfect her musical knowledge. With the amount of work that is placed on her by the musical department

3) The professors *aren't helping her*! This particular issue annoys me the most. My girlfriend literally goes to the professors, and are not willing to make appointments to help her learn the course material. 

*Her Ear Training professor told her he would get her a tutor before the first exam. The first exam passed and she failed. The second exam is in a week and just now is the professor assigning her a tutor. 

*Her percussion professor simply stated that he did not have time to help her and that was that. Now she is failing percussion. 

In short
This in particular is outraging me. But I don't know what I can do for her. So any advice on possible actions to improve my girlfriend's education? Thanks for reading.

TL;DR: My girlfriend isn't very good at music.
My girlfriend doesn't have time to perfect all the music courses put onto her by the university.

1) Music theory-based: modes and scales and intervals and strange jazz chords. Basically

2) Example-based: Here's a blues backing track

3) Technique-based: Here's a jazz swing rhythm. Here's a line of music where you can practice this rhythm. Now here's a basic 12-bar blues. Play simple phrases with a swing rhythm.  We can add different chords to the blues, just play whatever notes you want. Try using different accents, to play with the syncopation. Here's a bend and a dropoff. Now start learning riffs, mix and match, and music will magically appear.


I feel lost trying to work with any of these materials. I want something more systematic, because this approach is kind of in-between the theory-heavy stuff and the example-based stuff.  But then, clarinet is not guitar... I don't know how to create melodic lines in a clarinet idiom using the guitar resources I've found.

So I feel like I'm flailing, and so I don't know what I'm doing.

I don't really want to be able to play modern jazz, you know, be able to play a ""Horse with no name"" backing track and jam with it, but in an interesting way. Or play over a boogie woogie piano. Or create a dixieland line over ""Saints"".

This is a long-winded way to ask: I need a curriculum, etc, set of exercises, or skill goals, or whatever, that I know will allow me to be able to create music on my clarinet. The clarinet is similar enough to the sax that maybe a sax approach will be useful as well.

Anyone out there with suggestions?

-I always play the I and V note ~10-15 cents sharper.

-The VI is always ~20 cents flatter.

-The rest of the notes tend to be ~5-10 cents flatter.



My question is: 

How precise should I be in getting the right note? 

  I know I shouldn't obsess about it and a small variation is acceptable... but what is that variation? +/-5 cents? 10 cents? 20 cents? I would guess its relative to the person and how much ear training experience they have. But can anyone give me an idea of how much of a variation is acceptable for amateur musicians playing a fretless instrument?

You just stack the chord formula on the scale, write out your chord-scale, and have fun laying down progressions. Learning the shapes isn't a problem, I can do that in no time, understanding what order to learn the other chords in and what manner to use those chords in is more difficult for me though. I knew after Major/minor it was onto 7th chords but now what? Should I just learn random chord formulas and their inversions and work on integrating them with what I already know?

I need advice on learning techniques/materials. I play several other instruments (trombone,) but my best is trombone and I just don't like playing the super bass-ey classics. My favorites like Paganini, Beethoven and Tartini's music doesn't have much for a trombonist. And yes, I know there is quite a bit of Beethoven piano music, but my piano wouldn't be with me for at least another year so... I fear I'll have to re-teach it all to myself again.

I have a reasonable grasp on the basics -cleaning, but have never had a single lesson. I have several books, watch a couple of youtube channels on the basics, and sometimes call a family friend with questions. Sadly he lives on the other side of the country, so he can't personally teach me.

I have what could be viewed as a simple question but I feel it requires a bit of back story first.

I've been playing drums for about 7 years. With regards writing / coming up with new beats and fills, working from whatever instrument takes centre stage at the time.

I started playing guitar about 2 years ago and I feel the methodology that I use is not translating with it. I have come up with a few songs but mostly they start on what I would consider identical progressions and melodies from the ones before them. 

My practice lately has been focusing on basic music theory while trying to expand my pallet of chords. I have a working knowledge of open chords, alternate tunings paired with finger picking and plectrum technique. Learning covers has helped this in a huge way from getting more comfortable with all mentioned above along with how songs are actually structured.

The question I have is

performing-Advice/Tips?",1,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/Learnmusic/comments/otojo/hard_of_hearing_and_passionate_about_music/,"I've always loved to perform in any way in front of people. I was in Theatre Arts in high school, and I'd submit my stories and poetry to the school newspaper and such. I'm creative. I can write, draw, I've always wanted to really learn the piano, and it's hard to read tabs that are meant for a right-handed player(I'm left-handed)

For me, if I can. I know the ear can be trained to detect and identify different pitches and chords by ear, just as an artist's eyes can be trained to see light and shadow in a way which an untrained eye cannot. Also, deeper pitches are harder to pick up than higher pitches. Vocalists with deep voices are harder to hear, and high pitched vocalists are much easier. 

I am deaf in my right ear and I wear a hearing aid in my left, I can hear almost perfectly-about 85-90% (80&amp; of 100% with 100% being an ear with perfect hearing), but for some reason, with it in, I can't hear bass in music or television and without it I can hear the bass easily. It added a new dimension to music that I hadn't heard before, since I always used to wear it, and now I only wear it when I go out in public. The first time I heard bass on tv I thought the room was growling at me. It was kind of terrifying, communicate and read just like a hearing person, but hearing the lyrics in most songs is almost always impossible

With all of this in mind,C,etc) but I love the guitar, violin and fiddle. Will I ever be able to play by ear? Reading sheet music or learning chords isn't too difficult, but tuning a guitar on my own is hard, especially since I never know if I'm hearing ""correctly"". I constantly second guess myself when it comes to playing entirely by ear. 

Sorry for rambling so much. I've you're still reading, or advice will be welcome. Be honest, please. I deeply appreciate anything anyone has to say.

2. Small, but the main thing here is that it takes enough time to learn an instrument that it's easy to not realize you're making any progress at all. So force yourself into realizing that you *are* learning something by picking a small measurement.

But when I try to play simple songs - like the [Morrowind Theme](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWuNf4gxwuM) - I'm off pitch

I understand that I'm off pitch because I'm not used to jumping to notes yet and that I'm off time because I'm busy looking for the notes - but I don't understand why I sound so weak!

Reasons I am thinking it to learn it:

- I need a hobby

- It is versatile

- Keyboards play or can play an important role in many kinds of musical pieces I like, any genre on his keyboard, so I am 

- I don't really intend to be in a band, and given that singing, guitar and drums is something I don't want, keyboards can always be used

- We plan kids and all that, but playing something soft, soothing on a keyboard on low volume is something that is rarely disturbing others, right?

- I have heard it is not hard

- As far as I have heard

- I am a really good typist. Does that help?

Are these good reasons?

Reservations: we don't have much space. Can I learn on a small one I can put in my lap or put on the dinner table then put away when we eat?

So what I would like to ask is:

- Recommendation for a lap-top instrument. Small, good for learning, focus modern music, rock, electronica. Something Amazon is willing to deliver to Central Europe, being on amazon.de would be a huge bonus. Something with ""automatic rythms"" and ""single-finger chords"", whatever that means

- A good book that gets motivation and motivates you with instant successes. Like learning a nursery rhyme fast. A book that also gets modern music, I don't speak German that well.

So I'm new. Like, so I have a good idea of how both analogue and digital synths work.

BUT I WANT TO MAKE SOME MUSIC SO HERE'S MY IDEA.

I want to stick to completely (or almost completely) to a hardware set-up for live performances. I realize that that is difficult, front 242, skuppy), breakbeat (Altern8, Prodigy), and experimental/chill (808 State, **** Buttons). Other buzzwords could include loops, glitch

This is my first endeavor into live sound

[circuitbent sk-1]+[Monotron]+[TR-808 clone]+[one other synth] ----&gt; [mixer] ----&gt; [loop pedal] ----&gt; [PA]

The things explicitly mentioned are the pieces I'm already rocking. I have a bunch of other circuitbent things that can and will be used from time to time.

So does this work? Essentially I would have preset patches and rhythm sequences stored

My second question regards the [one other synth]. In my price range [which does not include true analogue :P] I have narrowed it down to the Roland Jx 305, or the trustworthy micoKORG. Perhaps even the Realistic Concertmate MG-1? What are general experiences like? After listening to sound reviews, I still can't decide. Are any of these better than the others for the sound I'm trying to achieve?

Check it out www.gitori.com
***********************************************

Hey guys

 I'm a guitarist and a web developer and created this to scratch my own itch. I hope you guys find it useful too. My primary problems/wishes that Gitori solves are:

1) Improving on the metronome. The most popular piece of advice I've gotten for improving technique is to use a metronome and start slowly
   I did this for many months and found the constant Metronome-tweaking to be annoying. I wanted an auto-pilot Metronome. Gitori is my attempt at an autopilot metronome.

2) I find practicing exercises/scales to be a bit boring. Especially taking the extra effort to practice everything in multiple keys

3) I lack the discipline to fix a minimum warmup period before trying to play faster. Having the whole practice workout laid out in front of me forces me to adhere.

4) My exercises and practice material are not organized in the same place. I have an ad-hoc collection of bookmarks/emails/books/CDs/PDFs  Gitori allows me to create my own exercises and put all of them in one place.

5) I would like to track my progress by looking at data. I wanna know how long I practiced last week/month. Was I able to consistently practice 5 days a week last month? Can I play faster than I could a month ago?

The app works best in Chrome but it is functional in FF and Safari. I have no idea if it works in IE. 
I'm looking forward to your feedback.

Here are my failed attempts so far.

1. I have done a few computer exercises on recognizing single intervals and get to a 60% recognition rate
2. If anything, C D Eb and so on. I found a nice book that contains a CD with basic folk songs. My task is to sing them along and transcribe them. This works much better for me, but the problem is that I'm a bad singer. I stopped doing these transcriptions for now, because I end up trying everything at the piano anyway, which is very exhausting and probably defeats the point.
3. Hence, because I need a source of correct pitches, but the piano is ""too precise"" for me to sing along to. Singing to guitar chords is better for me as I can hear when I'm not on pitch, but I still have to imagine the correct pitch myself.

I'm sure it's been asked a thousand times before

My older brother is a long-time guitar player. He plays mostly older tunes like Cash, and writes his own. I'd like to be able to play with him... but at the same time I want to avoid playing the guitar. I understand it may be the most efficient instrument choice for my interests, but I just do not want a guitar. Hands down. No contest. (Other stringed instruments are definitely up for grabs)

----------------

About me:
I'm 22, and what you might call ""Left Hand Stupid"" -- I just don't know what to do with it. My one experience with Piano left me staring at it wondering if it was even attached to my body. Oh, but on the bright side I've had several musical friends, as well as two music professors tell me I have something called *Perfect Pitch*. Whatever that means.

---------------------

This is what I'm looking for in an instrument

* Not a Guitar

* Time to become proficient not an eternity and a half (I'm looking at you

* Doesn't sound like a quartet of dying felines after months of play

* Can be played alongside a guitar easily (I'm guessing something in the key of C)

* Portable -- Something I can take down to the park

* Can easily play music like Cash, Celtic/Irish, Sea Shanties, Classical (Beethoven, Bach, Grieg) 
and the like... (I'll link a couple of my favorite songs that I'd like to be able to play parts of)

* Can be sung along with

* Can be self taught (though I intend to take lessons

* Can be commercially purchased (So no ""by-order-only"" instruments like a lute)

Sorry for such a long list... I figure

I'm not gonna just go out and buy the first instrument I see. I want to play around with several before committing to anything. That's why I've come here to narrow down my options...

I started playing the saxophone in high school. I loved band and jazz band, but it was usually more on the listening end than on the playing end. Jazz, metal, funk, rock... I'd listen to anything, but most of it had horns in it.


After college I decided that I wanted to get back into music. About a year and a half ago I saved up big for my own saxophone and put a big effort into it. I took lessons for an hour a week

That lasted about six or seven months. 

In February, 19/20 times I'll pick up the bass. And I realized that most of the music that I listen to has both a cool horn line and a cool bass line.

I'm considering selling the saxophone and using the money to a) help move in the next few months and b) save for an upright bass. In fact, are not cheap. Mine was about $4500 new*, which makes the problem twofold: first, the offer that I've been given is a LOT less than what I paid for it, and I'd hate to lose that much money in such a short time; secondly, I know that if I do change my mind again later down the road, there's no way that I could afford another baritone. A tenor, but there's something about the baritone that's just so full of power that a tenor just can't replicate.

The problem, but quite violently, rejecting what I'm studying, like a failed organ transplant. I just can't get it to go in, when what I read so starkly contradicts everything I already know, or think I know. And these contradictions seem so obvious to me, that I'm left mystified that no one seems to talk about them.

If it helps, or logic or mathematics, my education and experiences have fostered a certain understanding of the world that seems, at least at this point, to be fundamentally incompatible with music theory. If I want to continue, it looks like I'm just going to have to force myself to swallow a choking gob of cognitive dissonance, and accept things as true that just outright defy logic.

A couple examples.

I crack open a book about music theory, and out of those, **seven** (why not six, or an even divisor of twelve?) have for some reason been arbitrarily chosen as more important than the other five, and have been given letter names. How it's possible to simply blow past this without addressing how crazy it obviously would seem to the uninitiated and explaining how it is supposed to make sense ... I automatically and reflexively lose respect for what I'm reading, that this isn't even discussed.

I then almost invariably read that a note ""sounds the same"" as a note of the same letter in octaves above or below it. Incredibly, the other 880Hz -- how can they be said to sound the same? Of course because one is an even multiple of the other's frequency, they do combine in a manner different from other pairs of notes, and so they do have a special relationship with each other, and could be said to be compatible or interchangeable in certain passages. But to claim that they sound the same without immediately following with how and why you've chosen to redefine the word ""same"" for your own purposes -- this isn't just crazy, it's saying something that *simply isn't true*.

Samples needed:
WTF Boom
Wilhelm Scream

Ok you will fill it with gabber kicks and crazy claps (thats what will create the rhythm )
Once you're done with that experiment with various speeds. (if the gabber kicks start sounding like a drill use variation of the Wilhelm scream followed by wtf boom)
You can adjust the pitch of your kicks to create melody and you can add delay to make it more epic.

I have almost no money to buy one, usually saying they are good for beginners, and that is it, which is fine with me. 

So I find one particular seller who isn't in china or south-east asia, they have multiple colours and I am browsing them, when I notice something strange.

They essentially have 4 colours for the style of Violin that I am going to buy: White, and Black. The shitty thing is that the Black violin is 30% more simply because it is black! I mean wtf! That really pisses me off, and if I was Johnny 5, Oscar would be a dead man!

I just needed to vent. Thanks!",,t5_2rgto,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Learnmusic/comments/bljjf/a_premium_on_black/
