Back in college, despite exercising 30 minutes every morning, I started gaining weight. 

I came up with an idea: meal planning. The idea would be to plan out exactly what I was eating ahead of time, something I'd never been successful in before. The first few weeks, I ate the same breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day. Turns out this was a mistake. We need variety, but how could I have variety while still being able to buy in bulk? 

*Four breakfasts, I would, every shopping cycle, create a meal plan of four breakfasts, three lunches, and five dinners, and I would cycle them. The first day I would have breakfast 1, and dinner 1. The second day I would have breakfast 2, and dinner 3. The fourth day I would have breakfast 4, and dinner 5. The sixth day I would have breakfast 2

Additionally, protein, and fat. I could even easily count calories. 

Shopping was simply a matter of adding up all the ingredients for however many of each meal I would have and shopping for them and only them. I never threw anything out, and I chose meals that I loved eating and that were filling. 

Fortunately

**Example** (this is what I'm eating for the second half of February 2012)

Breakfasts  
1) Oatmeal with dried fruit, 3/4 c. dried fruit, 2 eggs, 2 Tbs. coffee)  
2) Scrambled eggs on toast with smoked salmon (4 eggs, 1/7 a small loaf of sourdough)  
3) Large fruit smoothie (4 oz. soy milk, 4 oz. frozen strawberries, 4 oz. frozen blueberries, and 4 oz. frozen mangoes)  
4) Denver omelet (4 eggs, 2 oz. shredded jack, 1/2 green bell pepper, 1/4 onion)  

Lunches  
1) Garbanzo salad (1 can garbanzo beans, 1/4 red onion, 1 clove garlic, 1 oz. feta, Italian dressing, black olives, Romaine lettuce)  
2) Tuna wrap (1 can solid tuna, olives, Romaine lettuce, olive oil, 2 Tbs. chopped black olives, 2 whole grain tortillas)  
3) Spinach and avocado salad (12 oz. baby spinach, juice of 1/2 lime, 1 Roma tomato, salt and pepper, 1/4 tsp. cumin)  

Dinners  
1) Salmon filet with roasted asparagus and micro greens (1 salmon filet, 1/2 lb. asparagus, lemon, nutmeg, 1 cup microgreens)  
2) Roman chicken (2 chicken thighs, olive oil, 1 slice prosciutto, 1/4 c. white wine, dried oregano, dried thyme, 2 Tbs. parsley leaves
3) Noodles with shiitake mushrooms (10 dried shiitake mushrooms, 1"" piece of ginger, soy sauce, 1 tsp,. sesame oil, white pepper)  
4) Steak and salad (sirloin cut, 1 c. arugula, 1 Roma tomato, 1 radish, salt and pepper)  
5) Chicken tostadas (1 chicken breast, juice of 1/2 lime, 1 clove garlic, 1 c. Romaine, 1 oz. queso fresco, olive oil, 2 whole wheat tortillas)  

It probably seems like I eat pretty damned well, there was a lot of rice and beans, but it was manageable and I always looked forward to eating.

1360013329.0,17w18j,"Some cheap, delicious, easy ways to get more vegetables in your diet",sweet_nightmares,229,27, more well-rounded diet.

Being a college student, relatively quick ways to get your daily vitamins without breaking the bank. I look forward to hearing how you guys incorporate them!

* * *

###First and foremost

Bagged broccoli, and they parboil them so you can spend minimal time in the kitchen. Put a few in a bowl and microwave them, or boil a pot of water to steam/boil them a couple minutes. Top with some butter, S&amp;P and serve next to your proteins and carbs. It's a great way to get some vitamins into your diet when you're feeling lazy. Frozen vegetables also work well in sautés.

Vegetables retain many of their vitamins when they are frozen, have a tendency to break down quickly. Furthermore, when you live up north during winter, frozen vegetables can actually be better than using ""fresh,"" and in these dark months it can definitely be easier on the wallet.

* * *

###Secondly

It sounds intimidating, even the Kraft dressings are acceptable when they go on sale; they last for months.

Here are a couple that are in my rotation:

* [Absolutely fabulous Greek/house dressing](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/absolutely-fabulous-greekhouse-dressing/detail.aspx)

* [Caesar salad supreme](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/caesar-salad-supreme/detail.aspx) - I sub ~1 tsp. fish sauce for the anchovies

* * *

###Thirdly

This is a great way to use up any fresh (or even frozen!) veggies you happen to have on hand. It's very versatile; you can add virtually any kind of vegetable and it will taste great. You can also play around with the seasonings and use hoisin sauce, sriracha, etc. The sauce itself isn't terribly different from good ol' [teriyaki](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/baked-teriyaki-chicken/detail.aspx).

**Default sauté recipe**

&gt;* 3 Tbs soy sauce
&gt;* 1 tsp sesame oil (gets kinda pricey
&gt;* 1 Tbs honey
&gt;* 2 Tbs veg. oil (I use canola: it's cheap
&gt;* 1 package (500g, but if you're a carnivore you could use the entire chicken, also cubed)
&gt;* Asian noodles or rice (I use udon usually
&gt;* 1 onion
&gt;* 2-3 cloves garlic
&gt;* 1 Tbs fresh ginger (~3/4 teaspoon if dried)
&gt;* 1 bell pepper
&gt;* 1 zucchini
&gt;* 1 tsp dried basil (8 or so leaves of fresh
&gt;
&gt;1. Mix the soy sauce, if you used dried instead of fresh) a bowl
&gt;2. Heat up a pan on med-high, skip this step entirely - it's already cooked. Once the tofu is done, transfer it (or the diced chicken) into the bowl with the sauce mixture.
&gt;3. In the same pan, and ginger (if fresh - and, at this point, celery, carrots, leeks, or cabbage) for about 2 minutes.
&gt;4. Add your bell pepper (and/or broccoli
&gt;5. Add the zucchini (and/or mushrooms
&gt;6. Add the tofu and the sauce into the pan and cook for 2 minutes.
&gt;7. Add the noodles
&gt;8. Add basil (and spinach, and serve.

Counting prep time, and it's cheap as hell (at least here in Canada).

I can't find Alton Brown's recipe

**Alton Brown's perfect rice recipe**

&gt;* 1 c. rice
&gt;* 1 Tbs oil
&gt;* 2 c. **boiling** water (or broth of your flavor)
&gt;
&gt;1. Preheat a pan on med-high. While that's going
&gt;2. Boil the broth in the microwave, followed by the rice. Move them around as the microwave is running. The goal here is to kind of toast the rice, to get them to pop, so that they impart a deeper flavor.
&gt;3. As soon as your stuff is boiling
&gt;4. (Optional) add some curry if you wish
&gt;5. Cover that pan, and leave it alone for 17 minutes. Don't even think about lifting the cover. If you do, the rice will come out dry. Leave it alone, and let it do its own thing. It works like magic. Trust me.

* * *

###Finally

Who doesn't like a nice potage when it's this cold outside? You can use lots of different kinds of veggies for these. Everything ranging from apples to sweet potatoes to broccoli

* [Roasted butternut squash soup with apple and bacon](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/roasted-butternut-squash-soup-with-apples-and-bacon/detail.aspx) - By far my favorite. Not even kidding

* [Sweet potato, and red lentil soup](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/sweet-potato-carrot-apple-and-red-lentil-soup/detail.aspx)

* [Curried carrot soup](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/curried-carrot-soup/detail.aspx)

* [Cream of asparagus soup](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/cream-of-fresh-asparagus-soup-ii/detail.aspx) - Frozen asparagus works perfectly here

* [Cream of broccoli soup](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/best-cream-of-broccoli-soup/detail.aspx)

There's a constant theme through most soups. All it takes, S&amp;P, some kind of broth, and vegetable(s). Play around with the veggies, add butter and seasonings to your preference, toss in the blender, and voilà! Vitamins

**DIRECTIONS:**

Boil the ramen noodles

Now the key ingredient. The eggs. Scramble the two eggs in a separate bowl and then mix in both packets of the ramen seasoning. This is crucial. The egg is going to become faux-meat since it will have all the flavoring of the meat from the seasoning.

Dump the noodles/veggie mix into a frying pan. Now drizzle the egg over all the noodles. Keep stirring up now. The egg will mainly cook onto the noodles and give it some flavor, so you'll be relying on the steam from the noodles to cook the egg. No one wants a runny egg in your noodles.

And that's it! I can get 3 plates out of it. It's not bad at all for ramen.

What are some simple recipes you have that are *truly* simple?

I also posted this to /r/Cooking but I figured I will get some very different answers from r/Cheap_Meals and r/Cooking.

I'll give one of mine to start it off.

**ndstumme's Onion Soup**

Serves 3-4. Takes 1.5-2 hours.

*Ingredients*

* 3 very large yellow onions -$.90-$5.00 depending on where you live/where you buy them.
* 6 cups of beef broth (I use bouillon cubes and water) - $2.50 for a jar of 25 bouillon cubes
* 4 Tbsp butter (half a stick)
* 1 Tbsp flour
* 1 cup red wine (not sure if needed since I've never *not* used it. Could probably get away without it
* (Optional - see below) Shredded cheese

*Price:* It's hard to price a half stick of butter, butter, flour, etc.

*Directions*

* Chop the onions. 

* Put the broth in a soup pot and set it on the stove to a low heat (1 or 2 setting). 

* In a skillet or small pot melt the butter. Once melted add the onions and let them sauté til brown. I set the stove to medium heat (4 on a scale of 1-7). Stir occasionally.

This is the waiting game so turn on some tunes or, as it will be about a half hour. If they haven't changed color after the half hour, but are adequately squishy and butter-soaked I usually call that good and move on to the next step.

* Add the flour to the onions and stir. Mixed well it will create a thicker onion-paste. Let cook for a few more minutes. Add the wine to the onions and stir to de-glaze them a bit

Time for more waiting. Let it simmer on a 2 or 3 for another half hour to an hour. Stir occasionally. After that it's done.

It's truly that simple: saute onions

Now, however, because it's not needed, and it works just fine without the cheese. Doesn't work so fine without the flour.

EDIT: added more details to comply with the spirit of /r/Cheap_Meals

EDIT2: You guys have some great ideas here. I'm gonna have to slowly work my way down the list and try them. Sometimes it's nice to share something that you might not even consider a recipe.

First of all, $3.50/lb on Chinese eggplant, $1 on a can of coconut milk, 10 cents on a jalapeno or 15 cents for a piece of ginger at my local Asian grocer. Big chains jack up the prices on ""international"" food.


Makes 8-10 servings:


**INGREDIENTS:**


- 2 cans coconut milk (not reduced fat) - you can add more coconut milk and use reduced fat if you want to serve as straight soup.

- Fish sauce

- Salt to taste

- Pepper to taste

- Soy sauce 3 tbsp

- Sugar (white or brown both work) 1-2 tbsp

- Garlic (6 cloves) chopped

- 1 Onion chopped

- Lime juice 2 tbsp (or a lime chopped

- Curry paste (I prefer Mae Ploy green curry paste) 1-3 tbsp depending on how hot you want it. I do 2-3. You can start with one and add in more later with the vegetables if you don't know your spice level.

- Basil (handful or 1 tsp dried)

- Ginger (a piece about 2 inches long

- Cilantro (garnish)

- Vegetable oil - 1 tbsp for veggies

- A protein 1-2 lbs (I prefer to get the fattier dark meat (legs or thighs and skin them

- Vegetables/fruit/fungus you like (I cook with some combination of 3-4 of these: bell pepper (1), mushrooms (1/3 lb), Chinese/Japanese eggplant (1), carrots (2-3), baby corn (1 small can), 1 zucchini, 3 tomatoes... basically everything tastes better in curry)  - chopped

- 1 Jalapeno/3 Thai chili peppers sliced - (optional

**COOKING:**


1) Chop protein into bite size pieces. Season with salt

2) Cook on stove in pan on medium with 1-2 tbsp of oil until cooked through (no pink/red) and set aside.


3) Heat 1 tbsp oil in ideally a deep stock/soup pot on medium heat. Add garlic

4) Add curry paste

5) Add in coconut milk.

6) Add in fish sauce, basil, all other vegetables, your protein, and pepper(s).

7) Bring to boil, but go ahead and salt and pepper to taste if you need it.

8) Garnish w/cilantro.

Everyone who told you to buy yogurt is going to end up costing you money. My boyfriend and I go through about 3/4 gallon of yogurt a week- how do we do this without owning an oil rig? Make it yourself. Don't worry

YOGURT

1. Go get a little thingy of yogurt that says ""active cultures"" on it. And a quart, but you have to get yogurt that says ""active cultures"". This is because between us, we are too lazy to source our own yogurt critters. The big dairy companies magnanimously package their microbial minions for perpetuating yogurt in containers marked ""active cultures"". Delicious.

2. Clean two pots and a spoon. If you have a thermometer for food (goes high temp) clean that too. Don't fuck this up. Use boiling hot water and soap if you have any. (I don't always use soap)

3. Now we prepare the milk. Try not to fuck this up. It's the step with the least margin for error, aside from a sudden move.) it is time to pasteurize the milk. This is because the milk probably still has competing microbial critters in it. Before you freak out, remember that pretty much every surface on the planet has competing microbial critters on it. Get rid of them by heating your milk up to 180F if you have a thermometer, or until it's foamy if you don't. It foams at 180 degrees. It'll be like a really big latte, according to what people who like coffee tell me when they see me making yogurt. I hate coffee.

4. Make this milk boiling easier on yourself by putting milk in a smaller pot and boiling water in a larger pot. That's why I said ""two pots"". It's because you don't have to sit there stirring for however long it takes to foam milk in a pot. When I make a gallon, wine, and anything that goes bad when the wrong microbes are in it. He is why it is called ""pasteurization"".

5. After it foams

6. Now you wait. Noticing a pattern? This is a low intensity job. I bet if we got all the stoners and told them to pay attention to making yogurt, it took a while to heat up, and you get to wait about an hour, to an hour and a half for it to cool down. Hooray. If you have a half gallon this will take less time, and so on for a quart. People who have more ice trays than I use ice water to cool it down. I just set a timer and make pie or something and come back to it.

7. Milk prepared? Pitch your yogurt (not into the trash, maybe only one. I'd go with one. I've never made yogurt in that small a quantity. 1/4 cup for a half gallon, 1/2 cup for a full gallon. Hey, that's like the size of a Fage container! It's like they want you to make an entire gallon of yogurt and never have to buy their stuff again. The reason why the ratio matters is because like I said up there, yogurts don't like to compete. If you start with too much yogurt, they won't process all the milk by the time they've become a giant colony, and if you start with too little, scoop the active culture yogurt into warmy-cool milk. Yogurt critters like it best at 110F. This is difficult to fuck up. They will still be fucking like yogurts (rabbits have nothing on these little horny bastards) as low as 90F and working their way through the Yogurt Sutra at 120F. I find it's easier to keep the yogurts happy if you're making a shitton of yogurt because it's harder to change the temperature of a gallon of liquid. Keep it in the oven on low with the door open, so resist the urge to stir to check how they're doing. That's how they decide to go on strike.

8. Wait. Again? Yes. This time, the more whey-y it will get. It's done when you have a solid mass of white with some liquid. My favorite was this time when I forgot it in the oven, and I came back, and there was just this giant gallon sized puck when I realized. Floating in greenish water. I have no idea how long that took. It was my first time, and I had decided to put it in the fridge right off, so yogurt didn't happen for the first three or four days before I decided to put it in the oven and poof. Life continued. Like I said, it's hard to fuck this up.

9. Done waiting? Now you stir. Stir a lot. Stir thoroughly. Unless you're making Greek style yogurt and you don't have a cheese cloth. Pour the whey out first, and put in your fridge. You can eat it the next day once it's been set up.

If you think it's runnier than grocery store type, did you? No. Your yogurt is done. You have a lot. For the price of one dinky container, you have a huge amount. I have eaten yogurts as a sweet, healthy meal. You can replace whipped cream and sour cream in your life with yogurt and be healthier for it. Make sure you save back some of your yogurt. Put that in the freezer. You can make more yogurt with that, and skip the step of buying more yogurt next time.

1369750492.0,1f770q,Decent $25 A Week Ingredients for 2,smashedit,134,25,50,"Been a long time since I posted but I see a lot of people looking for some tips so here is what I buy. I spend roughly $25 for a week of food between me and my spouse. We generally do not like processed food so these ingredients will be pretty simple. In addition to the below I do drink whey protein but I'll skip on including that.

This is basically for the people who don't know where to start eating frugally. If you print this out and bring it to the store it can help you get in the groove on the shopping side of things. Of course consult your doctor first and what not. Everything is mainly store brand/as generic as can be unless it a bogo on a name brand makes it cheaper. Often is the case for bread(thankfully as the quality difference is drastic).

* Starches:
 Rice (20lb bag), Flour (for breading/frying things)
 Tortillas (8 pack medium at dollar store
 Bread(local store has bogo on some type of bread weekly so I buy and freeze)
* Frozen: Brocolli + Mixed Veggies (Walmart
* Meat(buy raw/freeze in portions): Boneless chicken breast ($1.99lb at Walmart)
* Dairy: Milk
* Produce: Red pepper, Bananas, Apples, Pears
* Flavor: Pure Canola Oil, Spices(pretty cheap last a long time)
* Other: Tomato Sauce (Preggo is pretty cheap and no soybean oil)
* Optional: Raspberry Ice Tea mix(Buy in big container lasts forever as we mainly drink water)

So that is it. You've made it through the store and you're off to a cheap week/month of meals depending on how much you bought and how much freezer space you have. Oh wait one last thing

EDIT: Forgot Eggs + Cereal xD. Also I have had a giant bag of dried kidney beans forever so I forgot to mention.

P.S.: As many have mentioned this list will not be $25 you're first time purchasing as it leans heavily on the concept of buying in bulk to save money. For instance buying a $1 pack of noodles everytime you need it is equal to about 15 cents of noodles in the bulk package.

We're of Serbian decent, super easy to cook meal. It will last a student about 3-4 days, which is great in my case because I don't have to think about dinner for a while. I'll post a pic at the bottom. 

Ingredients: 

1 red bell pepper

2 carrots (or 3 if they're smaller)

2 yellow cooking onions

parsley

vegetable oil (or canola or olive

1-ish cups of white rice (I say ish because I didn't really measure)

1 tablespoon of tomato paste


Salt and pepper

Paprika (the red seasoning stuff)

Chicken drumsticks (boneless skinless, so no need to de-bone it... I just happened to buy boneless)


Directions:

1) The first thing I did was put the rice in a bowl of water to soak while I prepped the food.

2) In a saucepan coat the bottom with the cooking oil generously... but not more than a couple of millimetres

3) Finely chop the onions and put them in the saucepan on low heat (I put it on low heat because I didn't chop all my ingredients beforehand

4) Finely chop the carrots, and add to the saucepan, bringing the temperature up to medium heat

Don't forget to stir often!!!

5) Add a tablespoon of tomato paste into the mixture, just add it so it's not thick. 

6) Add an even amount of salt and pepper and paprika (I didn't measure again, and same with the pepper)

7) Let this cook for about 10 minutes

8) Add the chicken and stir often. Remember, not make it mushy. 

9) After 5 minutes of cooking

10) After you've cooked it for 10 minutes, and add it to the mix. Stir the rice around so its kind of distributed evenly throughout the dish. Add about half a cup of water, but again, I didn't measure. I made sure the water was slightly over the contents so it looked like it was drowning in the water. (Don't worry about the water, it will be all absorbed into the rice and the pilaf will come out sticky and amazing, and the chicken will be amazing, and you will be in pilaf heaven).

11) Set your cook time for an hour and a half

12) When its done, and then stuff your face for the next three days!

I spent about 20 odd dollars on the ingredients of this meal (I already had parsley, and paprika at home), and it lasts me 3-4 days. I'd say that's pretty cheap!

Hope you try it

As a 23 year-old living on my own in Washington, I'm a little short on time, space, and money. My fridge is really small, so while my frugal upbringing taught me to only buy milk in gallon containers since it's cheaper by the ounce, that took up a lot of room. Also, if I was ever about to leave for more than a week

So I started buying powdered milk. Bought in bulk

-The powder doesn't need refrigeration

-I haven't had to walk or drive to the store to buy new milk in two months.

-I re-use the same bottle (an old wide-mouthed orange juice container) to hold the milk

-If I want a thick cream

-It makes breakfast-on-the-go really easy and leak-free. I just toss cereal in a tupperware with some milk powder and drop it in my bag. Whenever I get wherever I'm going, and shazam, I have cereal with milk!

We posted a few months ago our beta version and had a ton of great responses from the Reddit community.

**The Details**

On July 18, ME and all places in between. Our camper van will serve as our home and mobile recording station on wheels for the next several months. Our route is going to snake east across the northern section of the USA and then snake back to Oregon along the southern route. We're gonna try our best to move with the good weather. 

Throughout our journey, flyers, word of mouth, Facebook, Twitter, Craigslist, Reddit, pure chance

**Why Have Breakfast with Strangers?:**

America is polarized. We feel that part of this civic problem is the lack of strangers connecting with strangers. We want to change this—or at least challenge it in our own small way—by taking strangers out to breakfast across America. We’ll share local diner fare and conversation, community, and commonality, culminating with a book: Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America.

**The Conversation:**

This journey is a conversation. We’ll skip the small talk and ask the big questions

**The Outcome:**

That was a bit too much for me

The reason we spent so much more before planning our meals, and vegetables (not tons, but I know we threw out something expired about once a week). This adds up. We bought things we never found time to cook, or never became appealing enough to eat (""oh this yogurt will be so healthy!"").

So here is how you do it:
Step 1: List what you already have in your fridge and pantry.
Step 2: Use a calendar or something to write what you will eat for breakfast, snack, and drink every day for however long. Try to choose things that you already have in your house. These need to be eaten first so they don't expire.
Step 3: Go through your meals and make a list of the things you need to buy.
Step 4: Only buy the things on your list!

Pro Tips: Use the unit price when comparing things to buy. You won't have to consider the price and the amount in the package. Whichever has the better unit price is the better deal. Also

If you plan to make three different meals that each call for a pound of meat. Don't buy 3 separate 1-lb units

Try putting the fresher items near the beginning of your meal plan list. Have more salads early because lettuce don't keep very long.

For a long time now, naturally organic, and has very high nutritional value. It is 14% by mass protein, instead of all carb like rice and pasta. It is also a complete protein, meaning has all 9 EAAs. It's also a good source of calcium, iron, etc. (see wiki article or something). 

It boils up and leaves you with something roughly resembling cous-cous (however, cold 'pasta' salads, etc. It would even make a great starch-type base for a caserole, instead of pasta. 

The huge benefit is that by eating this instead of rice or pasta, vitamins, etc. As I mentioned, it's also naturally organic because it has a layer of saponins on it while it is growing, so birds and insects do not consume it (apparently).

The recipe below uses another HUGE go-to item: soybeans (edamame)(shelled, stir fries, etc. Instead of rice and peas, quinoa and soybean has WAY better nutritional value, and tastes even better. 

My fave recipe is super cheap

Boil water, with quinoa, 1 to 2 parts frozen SHELLED soybean (organic are often the same price or cheaper), turn heat to high. When water begins to boil again, soybeans are warm and just slightly softened, but still nice and firm. Drain, transfer to bowl. 

Add a healthy amount of butter

Disclaimer: I absolutely LOVE, or, sadly, I am very happy to just mow down the rice with nothing on it at all. So my love for quinoa does not spawn from an inherent aversion to rice. It's just so much healthier that I use it instead most of the time.

1369077461.0,1epmux,Sambal (very spicy) with Coconut Rice,freakame,85,15,12,"When I visited Malaysia, and some anchovies. Plus the amazing sambal sauce. [Here's a good example from Singapore

I decided to start making it once I got home and found it was very simple, and pretty cheap. This recipe isn't exact, but the simplest one I've found that tastes pretty good.  

Recipe:

The Sambal - base of everything in this meal.

* 2 shallots

* 4 or 5 cloves of garlic (more if you reaaaaally like garlic)

* half a red onion (optional)

* 1/3 cup of oil (olive

* 1 - 2 tsp Shrimp paste.  It's pretty nasty smelling

* 3 or 4 tbl of finely ground chili (red pepper) powder.  Get this at an asian market - you can get a pound of it for under $2.

* sugar (optional)

* tamarind juice (optional)

Obliterate the shallots, toss the paste in, and let it let it brown for a minute or two.  Add about a half cup of very hot water to the shrimp paste and chili powder, stir.  Pour this mixture into the cooking paste and stir up.  Cook this mixture for about 15 minutes.  They key is cooking until it stops smelling like raw chili powder.  This makes it very aromatic, still very spicy, but doesn't have the bite it could.  Add a bit of sugar for a sweeter sauce (2 - 4 tbl) or some tamarind juice for some tartness.  This should make about a cup of nice, thick sauce. 

At this point you can do a few things with the sauce - toss in some shrimp and cook until done (I just use thawed, etc.  You can also start cooking potato wedges, put the sambal in over them, and cook until the sauce has dried over the surface of the taters. 

I usually serve this with coconut rice

* 2 cups of uncooked rice

* 2 cups of water

* 1 shallot

* 1 - 2 pandam leaves - get these at your asian grocer as well (frozen).  weird

* 1 can of coconut milk

Tie the pandam leaves in a knot to make them easy to take out, cook for 15 minutes on low covered.  Awesome stuff - a little sweet, great to offset the heat of the sambal.  I've found you really only need one can of coconut milk even if you doubled this recipe.  

My wife and I have been eating this a few times a week for the past few months.  It's very simple, dried anchovies (deep fried until golden brown), a hard boiled egg, and some peanuts.  We can have it for dinner with pork, shrimp, whatever we have lying about.  It's good just by itself and some rice.  

WARNING:  This stuff is atomic hot.  Like, and it's still delicious.  The key is cooking out the pepper until the flavor mellows. 

Good luck

EDIT:  Realized I left off total cost!
Per meal:  Around $4.00 for the sauce and rice.  This, pandam leaves, rice, oil, and shrimp paste for about 15 batches.  It will be more expensive if you buy a small bag of rice or if you add peanuts, anchovies, meat, $.50 for garlic,,

* coriander
* cumin
* turmeric
* lemon juice
* sriracha\*\*
* salt

\* This recipe is best with red lentils, and the color is nice because the turmeric makes everything bright yellow anyway.

\*\* The flavor of sriracha goes really nicely

**Directions**

1. Pour your olive oil into a saucepan
2. Add the water (be careful of the oil splattering), a bit more of the cumin, and a generous amount of the lemon juice and salt (the salt really brings all the flavors together). Add sriracha to taste (more if you like it more spicy).

that is what is left in the wok after i ate mine so it should last another two meals at least. it is suitable for vegetarians (but in this form not for vegans

it is:

* a tin of kidney beans

* a tin of (cooked) carrots (you can boil your own of course but i didn't have time today) 

* a tin of tomato soup (you could make your own of course or use some left over soup from a previous meal)

* a red onion

* a bell pepper



what i did:

* drain the beans and the carrots

* stir-fry the peppers in the wok with some oil

* add the onions and stir-fry those too (i add the peppers a few minutes before the onions because onions fry quickly)

* when those are done

* simmer/""sub-simmer"" (?) for about five minutes

* eat

all in all i think it must have taken about fifteen minutes. the ingredients cost £3.72 but i had a bell pepper and two onions left over so i guess that makes it about £3 (and as you can see there is rather a lot of it).

A lot of the recipes I've seen on here rely on a well stocked pantry

* Rice. Keep a 20lb bag
* Butter. Essential for so many recipes
* Baking powder. Helloooo fresh biscuits.
* Flour. At least 5lbs on hand at all times.
* Pasta. Macaroni, penne, linguine spaghetti, doesn't matter. Stock up when it's on sale.
* Salt


Why stock all that? Because then all you've gotta do is add a little protein and you're golden. All of the above adds up to maybe $40

* Milk. Evaporated or powdered can work in many recipes
* Meat. I am so NOT a vegetarian it hurts. Buy it at the counter
* Fruit/Veg. I like my greens separate from my main dishes. Sometimes by a couple days.
* Cheese. God DAMN I love cheese.


**Homemade Sausage Biscuits.**

Cost: ~$8

Servings: 5

Leftovers Last: 2-4 days.

Not really a well balanced meal, but your biscuits should last to Friday, though by Thurs you'll have to toast them or they'll be too hard.


Ingredients: 

* 2 Cups Flour
* ~3/4 Cup milk
* 4 Tbsp Butter/Shoterning
* 1 Tbsp baking powder
* 1 tsp Salt
* 1.25lbs or so of pork sausage.

Preheat oven to about 400. I can't be sure what you actually want, and salt in mixing bowl. Stir until evenly mixed or run the mixture through a sifter twice. Cut in the butter or shortening. I always use butter, and just get in there with my bare hand and crumble it into the flour until I can't feel any lumps larger than 3/16ths inch or so (5mm or so for you metricheads). You can use a fork or food processor if your hands are precious. Pour the milk in slowly while mixing slowly with a fork or spoon. Never pour it all in at once, you gotta get the consitensy just right. It should be like... bread dough. Play dough that's a month old or so. It should ball up and be just barely sticky. Sprinkle it with flour and kneed 10 times. Flatten, fold, push. Separate into 5 balls, I roll mine to 4-5 inches (10-13cm) across. Bake about 15 minutes or until golden brown on the outside. If they brown before the inside's done

While that's baking, but it'll work. And the thinner it is, the quicker breakfast is tomorrow morning. I usually layer the patties between some wax paper or plastic wrap so they're ready to go in the fridge. Pop a patty in the pan, split a biscuit and toast it, wrap the whole thing in a paper towel and walk out the door, breakfast in hand. When you feel a bit richer add an egg and some cheese. Can you do the same thing with biscuits in a can? Yea, but it's just nowhere near as good.


**Mac n Cheese**

cost~$5

Servings: I'll be damned if I can make this last more than four meals. Normal people should be able to make it go 6-8 servings.

Leftovers Last: 2-4 days.

Again not a well balanced meal. Might wanna eat an apple or something.


Ingredients: 

* 2 cups milk
* 4 Tbsp flour
* 4 Tbsp butter
* 1/2lb cheese. I usually use a combination of sharp cheddar and jack. FINELY SHREDDED.
* 1lb Pasta of your choice. I almost always use Rotini. So many nooks for sauce to hide.

Put your pasta water on to boil. Melt the butter over low heat in a ~1-quart saucepan. Mix in flour, dump the pasta on in and cook per directions. Keep the sauce at a low simmer and stir it constantly while the pasta cooks. Definitely not a ""fire and forget"" dinner. The sauce should thicken while the pasta is cooking, once it does keep stirring until the pasta is done, then remove it from heat, drain the pasta, and stir in the cheese. If there's not enough heat to melt all of the cheese, return to heat JUST LONG ENOUGH TO MELT THE CHEESE. Pour over the pasta, and enjoy. When you're richer,,

1354247523.0,1419ic,Korean dish made of pork sides and kimchi,podiem,41,9,18,"Ingredients:


-Pork side (google it and you should see strips of pork that almost look like bacon

-kimchi

-olive oil (just enough to coat the pan

Optional: 


-ko chu jang (this is korean chili paste

-OR sriracha, cajun, soy sauce, whatever you like!)

-rice as a side

The reason why I didn't specify any amount for the ingredients is because it is really not that important. 

**I stir fry pork and kimchi together in the olive oil until the pork is cooked and then I eat it with rice.** 

I make sure that the **kimchi is equal to the portion of pork sides** because I like wrapping the pork and rice in the kimchi

The chili paste and/or the sriracha (or other seasoning) is completely up to whether you think the dish needs more flavouring. I don't add more spices for several reasons: I make this dish when I'm in a rush, I'm lazy, and I actually like eating food with the least amount of seasoning as possible (except for edos, the sambal with the chicken yakisoba is delicious). But **if you want to try the chili paste (which I recommend) just start with about two heaping spoonfuls and stir in in the pork/kimchi stir fry mixture.** 

I buy about three dollars worth of pork side for two meals and trust me, and it's cheaper than a steak, but you still get as much meat*.

I'm not sure what the korean term for the dish is called but I guess it could be compared to fried spicy pork (dae ji go gi bbo kum). I can't be sure if it is a different way of making that dish

Also, salt, sugar, and pepper (depending on my taste) to make a really rough version of ""kimchi jigae"" (kimchi stew).

This is usually best for the colder months

I'll start with one I cooked yesterday

**Meatball Hotpot - $1.67 per serve** 

*4 servings alone

* 500g Pork Mince

* 1 can Chopped Tomatoes

* 1 can Butter Beans - drained

* 1/4 cup Tomato Paste

* 1 Medium Onion - finely chopped

* 1/2 cup Breadcrumbs (or 2 slices of toasted bread pulverised)

* 1 Egg - lightly beaten

* 1 tbsp Dried Herbs

* 2 Garlic Cloves - crushed

Preheat the oven to 180°C. Combine the mince, garlic and egg and mix thoroughly. Roll 1 tablespoon quantities of the mixture into balls and place in a casserole dish/oven safe pot in one layer, add the butter beans as a protective layer and place more meatballs on top (to prevent the meatballs sticking to each other).

Heat a large non-stick frying pan on a medium-low heat - add some oil, then pour over the meatballs and butter beans.

Place in the oven and cook for 45 minutes or until meatballs are cooked

This meal is great with a starchy accompaniment to flesh it out a little, rice or couscous - I went with a cheesy polenta as I had some nice parmesan hanging around. The parmesan upped the budget a bit, but there are many [polenta recipes that don't require cheese](http://culinaryarts.about.com/od/ricegrains/r/polenta.htm) and if you have polenta (about $2 for 500g or 8-10 servings), a stock cube and a tap - you're there.

To make the polenta more exciting (especially without the cheese) spread your cooked polenta out into a pan about 1 1/2 inches thick and put in the fridge for a few hours or overnight. 

Once set

**Cheesy Polenta: - $1.60 per serve with cheese

*Serves 2*

* 1 cup chicken stock

* 1 cup water

* 1/2 cup instant polenta (cornmeal)

* 25g butter

* 1/3 cup grated parmesan cheese

Bring chicken stock and water to the boil in a saucepan. Whisk in the polenta as you pour it slowly and gradually into the liquid. As the polenta cooks

- 1 lb. ground beef or turkey @ ~$2.50/lb.
- 1 lb. pasta of your choice @ $.99/lb.
- 4 cups beef or chicken broth @ $1.70
- 2 10.5 ounce cans of condensed soup
- 1/2 cup of ketchup (or thereabouts) @ ~$.50

Brown the beef/chicken in deep skillet. Season with salt and pepper. Add pasta, and soup, bring to a boil. Drop the heat, cover it, and cook until the pasta is done to your liking. This will *easily* feed 4 hungry people (or last one person several days; it'll keep in the fridge for a week or so).

Tips for the ""recipe"":

- Don't stop at salt and pepper. We throw in some garlic powder, dried herbs (Italian Seasoning blend, if you know it by that name), you name it.

- If you've got some veggies lying around (broccoli, onion), throw them in! 

- If you're really strapped for cash or ingredients, as they tend to be glorified salt licks. If you have to use them, limit them to 1-2 cubes per batch of this recipe.

- Is your concoction too runny? Mix one part cornstarch or flour to one part water up in a cup and add to the pot. Too thick? Thin it with some water. Repeat until you reach your desired consistency. 

- Throw in some cheese toward the end to add some tang and creaminess.

General food-buying tips that help me:

- Buy store-brand items. Often
- If you can help it
- If you find a low sodium version of something you were going to buy anyway
- Coupons

Learn how to cut it up yourself. It really is easy and takes almost no time.  Toss the parts you're not cooking tonight in sealable bags and freeze.  Even without vacuum sealing, breast bones if you deboned the titties, and other trimmings likewise go into a bag and thence to the freezer.  I don't think the wings are useful for much on their own (two wings? WTF you gonna do with two wings?) but do wonders for the next step. 

Next time you buy a bird, a stalk of celery (with green leaves if possible), and a  carrot.  A finger of ginger makes a fabulous enhancement.  Do NOT add salt.  Bring it to the simmer and let it go for a few hours.  If you don't boil it, you won't have much ""scum"" to deal with but if you do get ""scum"" just skim it off.  Strain and degrease.  I measure out one cup portions into zipper bags and freeze them.   Reduce it if you like to concentrate the flavor - just let it simmer until it's down to the volume you want.

I'll kick it off. I love brown rice. It's quite cheap, and it always involves boiling over a stovetop. While this is a perfectly reasonable way to prepare it, there's an easier, fool-proof method I'm stealing from Alton Brown: [baking](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/baked-brown-rice-recipe/index.html). It takes about an hour, but it works every time without exception. 

Once you've got baked brown rice, carrots, and peppers, and just mix them in. It can be a great, filling meal or a perfect side dish to a cheap main entrée.

Okay, bell pepper, and garlic. Then I poured in some [pastina](http://wundercooking3.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/pastina.jpg) and added enough water to cover, as well as a generous pinch of salt. Once it came to a boil, it took about 5 minutes to fully cook. I then drained it, added enough leftover tomato sauce (canned would be even cheaper) to lightly coat the pasta, and then a splash of heavy cream (could sub for milk or half&amp;half). I also seasoned to taste, pepper, and a couple drops of worcestershire and hot sauce. Fresh herbs (namely basil, crumbled sausage

- 1 pack of [tortillas/wraps](http://www.cookingclassy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/tortillas.jpg) of your choice.
- An amount (and variety) of salad dressing (or sauce) of your preference.

All ingredients used are fresh

 (Well

**Method:**

- **1** - Leaving the lettuce leaves aside along with the tortilla and dressing

- **2** - Give the ingredients a jolly good mix.

- **3** - Place one tortilla on a plate or similar

- **4** - Apply lettuce leaves to tortilla first

- **5** - Apply dressing/sauce atop ingredient mix.

- **6** - ""Wrap"" the tortilla to create the finished product.

- **7** - Eat (You should have some ingredient mix left over to make more wraps when needed).

**Preparation/Method Advice:**

- If you find steps 4 &amp; 6 lacking in detail

- If you would like a video that handles preparation and method together

**Frugal Advice:**

- At the beginning of the week I bought all the vegetables

- With 1 small, for about a week. With careful handling, portion control and correct storage, this could obviously be extended.

**General Advice:**

- On the wraps themselves: I am *definitely* an ""entry-level"" maker of meals and I thought mine were fabulous and *easily* as good as anything you can buy from a cafe or supermarket. As there is no cooking

- With *your* wraps, bacon, or whatever you fancy.

- Enough oil to cover the bottom of the pan
- 3 onions
- A whole bulb of garlic
- 1 tbsp Boullion powder (or use real stock if you have any)

NB: Many people are unfortunate enough to live in countries which do not have ready access to Marmite. The UN refuses to comment on this appalling human rights catastrophe. If you can't get marmite then substitute something umami tasting (e.g. chopped bacon or soy sauce)

1. Soak the beans overnight
2. Peel the garlic cloves and slice them in half lengthways. Fry them in the oil until you smell garlic. Then add the onions and slowly fry them until they're golden brown (you don't need to stir all the time).
3. Once you're satisfied with the friedness of your onions

* 1 Small Avocado - $0.50
* 1 Small Cucumber - $0.50
* Rice Vinegar - $2.00
* 2 cup White Rice
* Seaweed - $2.50 (I prefer roasted and salted)


**Method**

While the [rice is cooking](http://www.ehow.com/how_2042934_boil-rice.html), douse with rice vinegar so that it sticks together well. Lay out a single sheet of seaweed and lightly cover with rice vinegar. Wet your fingers with water (so the rice doesn't stick to them) and press a thin layer of rice on top, leaving a small strip on the bottom. Lay the salmon, cucumber and avocado in strips across the center of the seaweed. Roll it toward you gently but tight, the small strip without rice will create the outside seam. 

Optional: 

Sprinkle with sesame seeds.

Dip in soy sauce.

Top with Wasabi.

Top with spicy mayo (mayonaise and Sriracha sauce) 


**Notes**

This makes a lot (about four large rolls) of sushi. You'll probably have leftover rice and salmon. I always ball up the leftover rice and lay pieces of salmon on top and eat the next day.

**THE RECIPE**

*Equipment Needed:*

* 4-6qt Slowcooker

*Ingredients:*

* 1 package of boneless
* 2 cups of cut up red potatoes
* 1 jar of salsa
* 2 tbsp of Curry Power
* Salt to taste
* Some hot sauce or sriracha
* 1/2 a package of cream cheese or 1/4 of a tub of cream cheese

*Process:*

* 1) Place chicken on the bottom of the cooker
* 2) Potatoes, salt, and hot sauce
* 3) Gently stir the salsa and dry stuff to get it into the potatoes and avoid the chicken.
* 4) Cook for 8 hours on low
* 5) About 10-15 minutes before serving
* 6) Serve with rice!

**THE EXPENSE:**
Now

* Package of Chicken          **$5**

1263946073.0,aro49,Curried Veggies on the Cheap,Willie_The_Pimp,10,4,5,"This is a dish I make at least once a week

First, you're probably better off buying a pre-mixed curry powder. If you go this route, I suggest spending an extra buck or two because a) it won't be THAT expensive (less than 10 dollars, easily), b) this stuff should last you a long time anyway and c) yummy curry powder = yummy curry.

So now that we've got that out of the way

*Sweet Potatoes/Yams - These will make up the bulk of what fills you up

*Celery - Not a lot of flavor but they're good for you and they add a nice crunch. I usually cut up 2 or 3 stalks in cross-cut

*Green Apples - Cut them into wedges (remove the core)

*Yellow Onions - Use one or two

*Green bell peppers - These add a nice extra bit of flavor.

*Garlic - you can cut these however big you want; personally

*Optional - bouillon cube (I find that this makes the entirety of the dish more flavorful) 

*Other veggies - carrots, shallots, mushrooms, bean sprouts

To Cook:

Melt butter (1/4 or 1/3 tbsp should do) in a large, potatoes, peppers, and apples to the pan, cooking for another couple minutes (until everything in the pan has started to come together).

Now, add water to the pan so that all of your food is barely covered. If you have any, add a cube of vegetable bouillon (if you don't, you might want to add a little extra curry powder). You can also substitute vegetable broth/stock for the water if you've got it (this is probably the best option but, unless you've got the broth on hand, it's not a cheap one).

Cover, so don't worry so much about the other items).

Now that you have your curried vegetables, some pieces of chicken are nice (thighs are cheap so here would be a good place to use them as you won't be able to tell the difference). Enjoy, and if you have any suggestions, questions or your own experience to add, please leave a comment.

*1 can of Black Eyed Peas 

*1 can of ""french sliced"" Green Beans 

*at least 2 Bacons

*Salt / Pepper / Pepper / Pepper

*1/4 -1/2 Onion

I usually get the canned black eyed peas without greens

**Cooking:**

  Start by taking 2 strips of bacon (Or a third of a package), the better. You should add some pepper because, pepper bacon.

  As soon as the bacon goes in

  When everything is nice and happy, and add to the bacon/onion, and some salt / pepper. Turn the heat down to Low or Medium Low and once everything is hot(5-10 min), it's ready. Add Pepper to taste.

**Optional ingredients:**

The onion is highly recommended but ultimately

Chopped garlic: add a couple of minutes before you add the beans / peas.

Leftover meat: Chicken can really help turn this into more of a meal than a side dish. I usually add it right after the bacon


**Price:**

The canned food ranges from about 89 cents

I got a small package of Bacon for $3.99. While only 2 strips are necessary. I used about 1/3 of the package each time I made this. With that in mind

It's a bit uninspiring to look at, even in health food shops which tend to be expensive.

This recipe makes 6 servings. Use your biggest pot.

***

**Ingredients**

- Cup and a half TVP/soy mince. (Note: on the back it may have some bullshit instructions about soaking it in water. Do not.)

- Two onions

- Garlic

- Two cans chopped tomatoes

- Two cans beans (I used kidney and black eyed. To make it even cheaper

- Two bell peppers

- Tbsp oil

- A good squeeze tomato puree if you have some.

- **Spices**: You can vary these. I used:
&gt; - 4 tsp cumin
&gt; - 3 tsp chili (I like it hot)
&gt; - tsp each whole cumin and whole coriander
&gt; - Three mysterious dried chilis I found in the cupboard. I soaked them and threw them in the blender with the tomatoes.
&gt; - a dozen shakes of Tabasco

**Method**

1. Fry the onion
2. (optional: blend the tomatoes and puree until smooth. If you like big chunks of tomato or don't have a blender
3. Add tomatoes,beans and spices. The TVP will soak up a lot of the liquid, so add about a cup or more of water as needed.
4. Simmer with the lid on for 10 minutes.
5. Serve with rice.

1353380244.0,13hkxs,My take on Shepherd's Pie,grimfel,6,3,7,"I just concocted this tonight:

Heat a can of mixed veggies and drain.

Brown some ground beef

Make a small serving of instant mashed potatoes

Mix dried pancake mix (I use Bisquick) with MILK until it's thicker than pancake batter but thinner than a drop biscuit (just barely able to pour).

Pour the veggies/onion/beef/gravy into the bottom of an oven safe bowl (I've got stoneware stuff). Use your hands to 'crumble' the mashed potates over the gravy. Pour the biscuit batter over the entire thing. I left just a little room at the edges, and pepper.

Put into an oven preheated to 400-425F and bake until top is golden brown. Remove from oven

The final product gives a really nice difference in textures than just using mashed potato, so it doesn't end up gooey, but still adds moisture, keeping the biscuit part from being too dry.

It's tough to estimate the cost on this since it was mostly all things I already had on hand

I like that this can be easily scaled to feed anywhere from 1 or more people

1. Boil some pasta (works better with small pastas I.E. Macaroni, if you want)
2. Grate some cheese (I use chedder)
3. Open a can or two of tuna (you could probably use salmon or chicken or something
4. Drain cooked pasta, the heat from the pasta should melt the cheese.
5. This is the optional step. While I've never had it

The Second recipe is for the chicken..thing. This is slightly more expensive, so there you are. That's why my measurements are rough.

1. Put on some rice. I use white rice, I'm pretty lazy. That and it absorbs flavor really well, and I don't know if other rice does or not (Anyone feel liek telling me in the comments?)
2. Fry some sliced chicken breast. Boneless
3 cook veggies. I use broccoli and cauliflower. sometimes I add carrots if I'm feeling exotic.
4. add a can of broccoli soup to the chicken frying pan, just to thicken it a little.

Make a bed of rice, espceially if you can get crusty bread, and you used more soup than you exactly needed. A variation I want to try sometime is to just cook the chicken breast and make that a centerpiece, pouring the soup/veggies on afterwards, all on the rice, with a little cheese on top. The other thing I do with this one is use spaghetti instead of rice, changes the taste and meal

First you have to do a little prep work I buy chicken thighs as they are cheap and I think they taste good. I buy a pack of 10 and marinate them with soy sauce

Things you will needs

2 baked chicken thighs separated from the bone and chopped.  

1 small white onion chopped

3 cloves of garlic chopped

bit of ginger peeled and chopped

2 tsp dark soy sauce 

2 tsp regular soy sauce

fish sauce to taste

sugar to taste

chili garlic sauce to taste

2 cups cooked rice

2 eggs

Preparation 

I use a thin carbon steel wok but if all you have is a skillet you can make that work too. Heat up some cooking oil, garlic, and ginger. Cook until the onions start to become soft. push to the side, add a little more oil, crack in two eggs, scramble and combine with ingredients already in wok. Add fried rice, making sure to break up clumps if its cold. Add your sauces and sugar

This meal could easily feed two people, and I buy generic small tins of pineapple. I like to grill the chicken thighs the best but that takes more expensive fuel then just baking them in the oven. You can add more veggies and ingredients to your liking. This is just a basic cheap fried rice starter. Dont be scared of fish sauce if you have never cooked with it before. In the bottle it smells absolutely horrible at first until you get used to it, but in food it really accents flavors and does not taste anything like it smells like in the bottle. If you have ever eaten Vietnamese or Thai food you have probably had fish sauce and never knew it. Just be careful about how much you use because the stuff is strong, and try not to get any on your hands.

Because I'm living on a fairly stringent budget, I've lived off of nothing but pasta, poultry, and chili. I want to branch out now and put together an exact schedule of what I'll be cooking, on a week to week basis. 

My main food oriented goals include reducing my intake of meat, with the occasional fast food for convenience's sake. Over the course of this lifestyle change, I hope to decrease my consumption of meat gradually, using smaller amounts per dish, and hopefully getting rid of my reliance on meat. While it'll still be part of my diet, I want to be able to eat multiple meat-free dishes per week. I'll be sticking to whole grain products.

I have a basic understanding of nutrition

I put together my first week's schedule of eating. If anyone has any input, bulk shopping and creating cheap and healthy meals from the same ingredients to avoid monotony), please let me know. As it stands, there's a decent amount of overlap in my initial week's plan. 

A few quick notes: I'm not a breakfast person, and am willing to try new things. I have no food allergies (aside from mild lactose intolerance). I am a 22 year old working male, but have a decent amount of free time on my hands to cook. I do **not** have a complex kitchen setup- I live in a fraternity house with a stove/oven, microwave, a few frying pans, one large pot, enough knives for basic (albeit crude) cutting.

I live in a house with five grown men, boil, grill, broil, etc. and I'd like to think we're all pretty good at it. I think that between the five of us we can cook just about everything.

So here's where the dilemma comes. None of us particularly like cooking. So right off the bat we're looking to make meals that are fairly quick.

It usually goes that when one of us makes food, and potatoes would be a staple in most of the meals but how can we jazz some of this up and are there any other ingredients that would change up the monotony?

We've got a stove, rice cooker, toaster oven, blender, and a George Foreman grill. We've got one skillet, one frying pan, a few baking sheets, and a few pots. Not much in the way of utensils but it should be enough to get the job done.

Finally

So what can I pick up that is cheap,,False,,t5_2r7s6,False,,True

1321237843.0,mbckx,Stuffed cabbage and sauerkraut!  Cheap and Delicious!,sarasals,1,0,0,"Stuffed Cabbage with Sauerkraut 

Ingredients

1 head of cabbage

1 bag of Sauerkraut

1 small apple (Mcintosh or gala) Skinned and sliced/ julienned (you just want small pieces)

1 tbsp brown sugar

1 lb ground beef (chuck)

1 lb ground pork

1/3 cup uncooked rice

1/3 red onion

1 can diced tomatoes

1 tsp chopped garlic

pinch of ground pepper

Directions

Start by coring your cabbage and pulling the leaves off (all in one piece is best
Whilst cooking your leaves mix together your pork, garlic, onions and other spices in a large bowl and have them ready to go once your leaves are done cooking.

In a large skillet combine your sauerkraut
Make small (not quite golf ball sized) meatballs with your rice/ meat mixture and then place them inside a leaf (you want to start down where the large vein is/ where the cabbage would’ve been attached to the base of the head).  Begin to roll from the large vein and when you have rolled the leaf (with the meat inside) about halfway

Once you’ve used up all of your meat or cabbage

Allow the rolls to cook in the skillet for at least 30-45 minutes (You can’t really overcook the meat since it’s such a moist environment) but I wouldn’t cook more than an hr and a half.  You can cut open a roll to check if the meat is done cooking
