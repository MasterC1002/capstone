I'll list examples.

Major Spoilers below: read with caution.

In the movie The Woodsman, and a little girl is playing.  He starts talking to her, and I knew this was a cringe scene, so I turned the volume down like I always do at cringe scenes, and I was hoping for the best, but then he broke, and asked her if she wanted to sit on his lap.  The entire tone of the movie changed at that point.  You knew he did something terrible before

It's not a physical scene, but now she had to act it out. 

Another one, how did this not affect everyone involved, or how DID it affect them.  She had to act it out with a very serious Actor who is much older than she is.  This isn't two 12 year olds kissing for the first time.

Last example, his daughter meets an online predator, meets him, and gets raped by her.  In the scene that precedes it, she models lingerie for the guy, and it's on film.  It is indeed, a little more risque than just a bikini too.  But then she sits on the bed and he starts to touch her stomach, visual

She was 15 when she played the part of Annie.  So she is a bit more mature than the previously mentioned girls

Can anyone shed any light on this?

**Edit:  I want to take this time to thank everybody who joined in.  I love watching movies more than anything.  The only movies my ex-wife likes that are similar to mine are non-raunchy comedies and horror movies without sex scenes.  So it's a bit difficult to have these kinds of discussions with her.  I always like to think about what I watch and even if there is nobody around

**It was pointed out that I seem to like fucked up movies.  This is true.  But these scenes aren't only in fucked up, as we pointed out.  It's in television on almost any channel.  It can be a drama(Trust), a horror film(The Exorcist and Orphan), or even a comedy(Pineapple Express).**

**These scenes can be for shock value, or any other kind of reason.  But the sad truth is that these kind of events do happen in everyday life, in any culture, country, gender, and most important of all, any kind of person.  People we trust, and obviously people we fear.**

1376591565.0,1kfnfk,Can anyone help me understand this bizarre sensation I can induce in my body?,FadieZ,233,44,75,"Ever since I can remember

The sensation usually starts in my lower back, try getting to the point where you flex your quadriceps JUST before they start flexing. Holding on to that sweet spot just before contraction gives you an idea of what is happening.

As I begin to ""flex"" this ""muscle"" inside my back, up my neck into my head and my arms until it is felt by every cell in my body.

The feeling can almost be described as the approach before sexual climax, the feeling is experienced in the entire body, whereas orgasm is more localized in the genital area.

As I induce this sensation, my body inevitably experiences a shiver and I need to stop.

Here is a post from about 4 years ago with different accounts of this phenomenon: [AskReddit post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/8nbje/have_you_ever_experienced_anything_which_you/c09txfd).

I contacted some of the people in the post a year later because my neurologist took an interest to this phenomenon and wanted to get some more information. Here is one alternate description of the sensation by /u/Rubenb:

&gt;Yeah, and when I do that it sends an energetic feeling through my back and legs, radiating outwards from my lower back region. It usually only works while seated or laying down, and I also need to hold my breath to make it happen. If I focus on it I can feel it faintly in other bodyparts as well, but that might just be my imagination. I have to make considerable effort to make it last more than a few seconds, and when I do that some muscles twitch slightly and unvoluntarily. The effect gets gradually fainter if I do it a few times in a row, and I start feeling a bit tired in my legs and head as well. I have also noticed that I can reproduce that endorphin rush you can get after sporting at will (although not as intense)
&gt;
&gt;I hope you can find out something interesting about it

and another from /u/TwoToke:

&gt;Wow
&gt;
&gt;I still have no clue how to describe how I'm able to do it. I would say that it's the opposite of contracting all the muscles in your body
&gt;
&gt;The best explanation I could come up with was some sort of self- induced vasodilation:
&gt;
&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation
&gt;
&gt;I would suggest pasting all of the conversations we had in that thread into one document and let the neurologist see if they can pick out the clues they need. The ""Cold Electricity"" description for the feeling was the best I had heard
&gt;
&gt;Definitely let me know if they figure it out. You've peeked my curiosity again...

Now to the main issue: RyJones banning people and deleting comments.



RyJones is one of our most active moderators who continually tries to maintain the integrity of /r/answers. There is no doubt in my mind that every action RyJones does in this subreddit is to help our members have a better experience. He is incredibly proactive in filtering out comments/users that make poor submissions. In his defence, do I condone it? Well no, but I also do not disapprove it. I'm certain that members of /r/answers do not want to scroll down to the bottom of a page just to find the correct answer of a question. Conversely, I am sure members do not want to be banned for having a discussion (non-answers) which may lead to a correct answer. 



So what is the answer to this issue? As it stands, all the other moderators agree that an outright banning (in [these](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/kwg5k/ive_been_banned_from_reddit_answers_apparently/) circumstances) is not a fair approach. /r/answers will advise RyJones to be more lenient in his approach when banning people and filtering submissions.

* It's a robo-call that says someone is TRYING to collect call me but that I have to sign up for a prepaid account first.

* They're very persistent
* I've googled the heck out of the company and they SEEM to be a real thing
* I suppose it's possible that someone I know is in jail and I don't know about it

There are a lot of reasons not to have done that. 

*First

*The eagle couldn't have carried Frodo all that way.

*If you just gave the eagle the ring then you have a giant eagle with the power of the ring. A giant, eagle overlord is probably worse than Sauron. 

*Remember the Nazgul? They upgraded to birds during the story. 

*There was a giant flaming eyeball searching the skies. I think maybe it might have noticed an eagle with a Hobbit on it's back.

A possible objection: if the eagle couldn't fly with Frodo then how did he get airlifted out of there? Answer: because after the ring was destroyed the Nazgul and Sauron were dead and the skies were once again safe for giant eagles. 

Objection: how did the eagle fly him all the way back to Rivendell? Answer: he didn't. I'd have to read it again

This suggests a freely floating RMB would move to

On the other hand, property etc.

It seems to me as if the US thinks very highly of the RMB

Edit: Our apartment is a corner apartment and the kitchen faces the outside.  So highly unlikely that our neighbors are cooking meth.  I may check for mold or something of that nature.  I also think we will buy a black light and look for the source.  I'm really hoping that it isn't the carpet because I don't want to have to move everything out but I guess that's better than living with the smell.  Thanks for all of your advice guys!

The balls feel like glazed ceramic.  The are about the weight of marbles.  Each has 3-4 craters in no apparent pattern.  The craters are not-quite flat surfaces which break the glaze finish.

My dad does not know what they are.  Neither of my grandparents (who grew up in the area) know what they are.
