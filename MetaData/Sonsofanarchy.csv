This has NOTHING to do with Jax keeping his family close to him.  If his end game was to stay with SAMCRO forever, but you can see that Tara and his kids are very important to him.  As for the ripped up papers

This has EVERYTHING to do with Gemma wanting to keep her family whole and keep her position of power as the female head of SAMCRO.  She did it with JT, and Gemma knocked Tara back into her seat.  Every time Tara has choked someone, they have submitted.  Gemma hit back and won the exchange, which we haven't seen before.  IMO, Tara is on her way out which is going to lead Jax into more instability, and Gemma is going to get close with her family once more regardless of her wrongdoings.

Tara is headed to jail, the US Marshall is going to work her to give up information in hopes of rebuilding a RICO case against SAMCRO.  Tara will be offered a deal to ""Give up the Sons, or give up your sons"" which I feel will be a large plot point in next season.  I say this because Jax has been very open with Tara about the club, so she has a ton of ""Present"" information which can be leveraged for her freedom (which Juice once had).  Also, with Clay being framed by Jax and SAMCRO and a price being put on his head, he can take Otto's place as ""History"" in exchange for protection from Pope's people inside.

As many people have said, and will destroy everything he loves and holds close because he can't let go of ""This Life"".  I know tons of people have other theories as well, so let's get them started away from the Season Finale Discussion Thread.

TL;DR Gemma is a selfish needy bitch.  Jax will become a monster.  Clay is ""History"" (was Otto)

I kept waiting for that moment. 

Even just before the big moment

I'm not sure when I realized that moment would never come, hands clasped on top of my head, in shock.

It's not very often TV catches me off guard. Especially in this day and age where news of a cast member's departure from a show is posted all over the internet

The last 5 minutes of the next episode, I just thought ""okay, time to say goodbye and move on."" It's not until Bobby places the beanie under Ope's hand, teary eyed, I realize ""ah shit, this is gonna hurt.""

And then ""Jax, goddamn tears. 

I've had an uncle and a grandparent die in the past year and I never shed a tear for them

I just finished my first Sons marathon since season 5 ended. I thought time would make it a little less sad to watch. It does not.

Not since Dr Cox killed all those patients in Scrubs (""My Lunch"") has TV evoked such emotion in me. Gemma telling Jax and Clay about the rape rates up there

Some of the best TV I've ever seen

If this is what I think is going on, Jax will kill Pope at the meet with Clay's gun, bringing the hit squad on Clay.

[Spoilers through Ep. 5-10]",bamfsEnnui,67,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/Sonsofanarchy/comments/13gw4o/dont_underestimate_clay_my_conspiracy_theory/, it may jump around a bit and I'm not going to go super deep into each of my theories

I've had a slightly different experience with SoA than some of you.  I watched the entire series in less than a month and am finally to the point where I have to wait to catch the episodes weekly.  It took me a while to get into the facets of the different characters and for the longest time, my opinion has changed - a LOT.

I think that Clay is a sociopath who has been able to keep his true intentions and intelligence (or cunning perhaps) under the radar by playing himself down a bit, why get more involved when she'll do it anyway and deflect the attention from him?

I think that Clay had been setting up a way for Jax to take over the gavel for quite some time.  He's been using his hands to slowly show weakness, he kept playing more injured than he needed to be.  When Gemma wasn't there to administer his shots, he quit using the cortisone treatment in his hands.  Sure, there have been times when he's lost the ability to ride due to his hands, but a few seemed to have been for dramatic purposes on his part and in other cases, they turned out to conveniently work in his favor - Frankie Diamonds for example.  Not to say that there isn't something actually wrong with his hands, but could he perhaps be exaggerating it a bit to portray himself as less of a threat than he already is?

Why would he want Jax to take up the gavel before he absolutely needed to?  To see if he would run the club the way Clay wanted it done.  To test his loyalties.  When he saw that Jax was headed in a different direction than where he wanted him to be going with things as his VP

Every order Clay issued when President outside of general business such as runs seemed to be a test of faith.  Tig was probably already a psychopath before Clay's influence

Of course, to see if he would save him.  He may have been betting heavy on that one, but he knew Jax would at least stop Opie from killing him if only for Opie's own sake.

On to Gemma...  I don't think he really loves her.  I don't think he is capable of love.  She was the Queen of the club and he wanted the club.  She is a convenience to him.  She handles a lot of his dirty work, but I don't think his remorse was from hurting a woman that he loved, it was in simply that loss of control in a way that the whole club saw.  It's implied that Gemma has something to hide as well concerning JT's death, and Clay promises to never reveal it.  I question what she believes she is responsible for versus what actually happened and how much of a hold it gave him over her from the beginning.

When he and Gemma split

Over the years members of the First Nine have been dropping off, or something in the club sparked him to need to take it over and have it for himself.  It's not the brotherhood for him, it's the power over the members.

He has a knack of putting a spin on every piece of information that is discovered about him that would set him in a bad light.  Admitting that he put the hit out on Opie that resulted in Donna's death and killing Piney for example.  Because he admitted it, take it off the table for a while.

He also is able to quickly take any new piece of the puzzle that he finds out has been hidden from him and put it to good use.  He needs new people to be on his side, he tosses Juice a bone to keep him quiet about both of their secrets and heads out to Lenny to get more info.  No sooner does he get the scoop on Otto then he has a meeting with Romeo setting up Jax.  He's figured out that Romeo is protected somehow, he also knows exactly what Romeo is capable of.  He uses some BS ""I can start another group to keep the guns..."" excuse to get Romeo to eliminate Jax and put him back in charge of the club.  There's no way he could take back the gavel at this point without that type of assistance.  Jax has made too many ties with people like Pope and is in the process of making the club more legit than Clay would like it to be.  The Prince has proven himself to not be going in Clay's direction, it's time for him to be dethroned.

With Clay back in charge, anything positive that happened between them via Jax can be kept, anything bad, such as the GB incident, can be blamed entirely on Jax.  He's already shown that he doesn't give a damn about Tara, and just now that he's willing to sacrifice Jax.  If he gets rid of both of them, most of the evidence against him regarding JT's death goes away except for Gemma and Unser who are both also involved somehow.

Now, but I think he's been orchestrating much more behind the scenes than the viewers are supposed to realize.  These are just my thoughts on how viscous of a bastard he **really** is.

Quick side note - I may be overstating Tig's psychopathic tendencies.  He actually does have feelings and shows remorse.  I just don't know how exactly to diagnose him as I am not a professional.  But with Clay

I had never have much thought into watching this show. 

I knew of SoA

Long story short

But then I decided one night, I was hooked and watched the entire series (combo of Netflix and torrent) within three days. I should add, when I get weekends off, I sometimes have tv show marathons. 

So I watched BrBd

Then a month later I watched all three seasons of Justified. Another great show I never cared to think of watching.

Then on Friday I decided to watch a series. I picked SoA.

My word. It was amazing. The story telling, music, the women, it is all high quality.

I laughed. I cried. I sat on the edge of nervous anticipation. 

You know the writing and acting is stellar when you passionately want a character to die (Stahl). lol

It's a show that had me thinking one thing and the n completely threw me for a curve.

Another prediction is that Jax is finding out a way that he can kill Pope. He doesn't want anyone else but him thinking about it. The shit will happen

The Nomads would know that Clay wasn't in the house, so the hit was certainly meant for Gemma.

The only person with motive to hurt Gemma is Clay, and I think launching a sneak attack on her is right up his alley.  Of course knowing Clay, he could have another motive.  He might even be trying to frame the Mayans or the Irish to sabotage the deal that Jax is suddenly so dead set on completing.

Gemma went to threaten Tara at, if that was her plan? It's nothing new that Tara is just as bullheaded as Gemma, I doubt that what Tara said startled Gemma enough to have her go right to the cops.  
 
So
 
There's a chance that Gemma went along and told the cops after Clay was arrested
 
Now, but Jax will obviously not want to get out without Tara. Some people say this is when Gemma went to the cops. But, looking at the time, it just doesn't add up. Jax presumably went home after talking to Nero, with the police close behind, and with Gemma after the police. Where did Gemma find the time to tell the police, and where did the police get the time to go from this to getting a warrant and then making the actual arrest? Assuming that going from ""new information"" to a warrant takes an hour, and then assuming that the cops took an hour to to from the warrant to the arrest itself

My 'uncle' and his friends proceed to tell me how they like to let puppies loose on this track in their 'clubhouse' and then they'd take shots at it with their pistols.  I thought he was trying to scare me but my Dad confirmed that they weren't joking.


In the show they kinda hint at the darker aspects of these guys (Tig is probably neck-deep in cold pussy right now) but really they could never show how it really is.

I'd personally love to see the SOA go visit one of their support clubs (like in ""Patchover"") and instead find them to be the depraved animals that many 1%ers are.

It would be a nice juxtaposition

There you have it. 
Every piece I've found where it is said that Gemma betrayed Tara is never using  quotes

He wants us to discuss this, unsourced myth can easily become a kind of conversation stopper. 
I'm totally down to debate the liklihood or improbablility of this scenario but you can't make a case just by saying you know he said it and the link's around here somewhere.


Example of a case being made:

All that stuff about her being a cockroach, is relevant material, but that doesn't automatically mean that she did **a** because **b**.  

On the one hand she hates Tara

So I watched the first season and was hooked. After a three week binge, and the suspense of Season 4 had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. I haven't felt this kind of excitement for a TV show since Breaking Bad. It really is a great show.

I don't know how to get in touch with him(except for twitter which I dislike).
So here is my Idea for the game.

Sons of Anarchy would lend itself well to a Mass Effect 2 style of gameplay. For all the shoot outs and chases there are a lot of dialogue moments that would fit well with that style of gameplay. This would have to take place as a prequel I think. Just so all the characters are in good working order. You would play as one of the batch of prospects before Halfsac was around. You've got gun running

I'm not sure if it needs to be open world necessarily. But I would like to see opportunity for lots of choice. All of the SOA characters are very different from each other yet they find common ground in the Sons. I want that to come across in the game. Your character is different due to the choices in the game. You would have to do what you could to make due. If that means making a deal to save your family or what have you.

Chibs - I've seen he will become VP

Bobby - I think will leave SAMCRO. He was such a thorn in Jax's side the last few episodes I wouldn't be surprised if he's voted out unless he changes his ways. 

Tig - will stay

Clay - will try from inside to get revenge on Jax

Gemma - to be honest

Nero - He's gotta go soon

Juice - As much as I hope he stays, he tried to help Clay just before he was arrested further going against Jax. His days are numbered in my opinion. 

Tara - I think she'll take some shit in prison and try her best to get out and away from Charming. Maybe she'll finally realise Jax isn't worth all of this.

So

I think Tara is going to lose her shit in Season 5. Not to put any fancy technical term to it, and she's never been happy, truly happy, for any appreciable amount of time. We always knew that would be a point of conflict for Jax, Gemma and the club. 

However, the self-inflicted smashing of her hand when Wendy showed up (Another wild card that bitch is!) and then in the last couple of episodes asking Jax and Gemma: ""Tell me you love me"" with that creepy vacant look in her eyes. It was spooky. Then, sobbing, saying over and over 'he's mine' at the very end of the Season 4 finale. 

And now

What if she told the Irish Kings about the CIA? I mean, Jax will go to prison. For awhile. BUT.....the entire SOA worldwide gets taken down by the feds. When Jax gets out, he'll have nothing left but her. 

Just a thought. What do you guys think? ",self,t5_2rbpl,1343430800.0,,patch,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Sonsofanarchy/comments/x6iya/tara_the_season_5_wild_card_season_4_spoilers/

Why the hell is Tara a surgeon? This is 4 years of undergrad + 4 years of med school + a minimum 4-6 year residency we're talking about. 

And surgeon residencies are BRUTAL. The kind of career that people dedicate their lives and almost all their waking hours to. Not getting involved with fringe nonsense like fighting biker whores and getting chased down by gang members. 

More so

Sure Jax loves his club and all

It just seems so unreal to me that Jax is out scraping cash together by almost getting killed daily, a surgeon?

A couple of really interesting meta references (for lack of a better term) came up that I thought were really awesome and thought I would share and ask if anyone has caught any others. 

1.  can't recall the exact episode but Jax was with some girl and she was scared he was going to kill her and his line was did you think I was gonna Adriana you?  (reference to Drea de Matteo's character on the Sopranos)

2. When Gemma was on the run and some one suggested she dye her hair red and she said she would rather shave it bald (reference to Katy Sagal's infamous Peggy Bundy character from married with children)

For me it has always been Chibs.

Always been loyal to the club sometimes to his own detriment.
also he has to be the most authentic Scotsman on tv.
As a Scotsman myself nothing grinds my gears more than the fake pseudo Scottish accents and dialogue.
Its usually about as Scottish as Groundskeeper Willie but Chibs speaks how real scottish people speak all the wee phrases and things I think he must have some input in the scripting of his character.
