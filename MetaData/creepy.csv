So I work full time during the day and live with my parents. True story. Anyway, a bench etc. Nobody cares. Only other bit of backstory-- my parents are currently in Tahoe visiting my neighbors new cabin. I'm an only child.

Ok

At least the light is on in the house and I'm outside in the dark

So I ran back into the garage to grab a crowbar that hangs on the wall. I didn't even think about it

Welp

When I got back to the french doors the dude was not in that room anymore. No big deal. I paused and decided to just barge in ready to swing at anything. I opened the door and I think yelled, thinking that there's no way this is how its going to be. It took me MAYBE ten seconds to get the crowbar from the garage. There is no way this guy got out, and there is no way out of the house that I wouldn't see or hear from the spot where I was now standing, or from the garage for that matter. So I just stood there waiting for some kind of sound. 

After who knows how long

As you might have guessed where this is going, all the while keeping an eye on the house. I would have taken brutal hand-to-hand over this bullshit under any circumstances. This is ridiculous. I guess I'm going to sit here with my crowbar for the rest of the goddamn night waiting on the slightest sound to start checking rooms again. Wow, I didn't check the goddamn attic. Like I'm going to check the goddamn attic. Holy shit. If I don't get to bust the head of some dude that comes out of my closet real soon I don't think I'll be sleeping for a long time. 

Sorry if any of this is wildly incoherent. 



**Edit:** TL;DR
Home alone, going insane, thx


**Edit:** I realize that this will probably get buried. No big deal. I'll just go insane by myself. Cool.

**Update** 

So last night I did coutless laps around the inside of the house. It seemed like the more tired I got the more this single event kept happening-- I kept seeing a sillouhette out of the corner of my eye in different rooms, I decided to go back to the garage to hang out with my puppy where I could at least maintain a good vantage point on the whole house. The problem is I kept staring at those french doors and being overwhelmed with uneasyness thinking about a dark figure walking through that room with his head down. So I figured I would grab my camera and just hit record for the sake of my sanity. 

So in case you guys were wondering why it took me so long to update

After this happened

 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkKQ5vuS0tk

I also checked the basement for the first time:
 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDudZOth7sc


**Final Update:**

So I started feeling a bit better this morning. I stopped seeing things after I posted the videos
 
Only problem is that its apparently not over. What happened just now... I am fucking done. I am packing right now to go drive to my friends place who lives on the other side of the state. I don't care. I am completely depleted. The most real thing since the first encounter happened on my way home from work...

Ugh. Here goes. 

I was driving home in the dark. As soon as I got off the freeway I began remembering what I was coming back to. My gut just gave me the worst feeling as I got within blocks of the house

By the time I could see my driveway the hair on my arms was already standing up. But shit didn't hit the fan until I pulled half way into the driveway and saw a goddamn figure standing there. I was frozen for a second. My headlights only illuminated like up to chest level

The figure instantaneously changed direction in response to being illuminated and broke into a full sprint down the street. I didn't even have to hit reverse. I just cut the wheel and went over the curb after this fuck. I then went street to street chasing just a glimpse of this guy as he seemingly dissappeard around every corner just a split second after I saw him. I wasn't even driving right I was so freaked. I felt like I couldn't even shift correctly. I had to stop at every goddamn street corner to try to look and see where this guy had gone. Luckily I caught a shadow or a glimpse every time. This went on until I came around one last corner and saw full-on the guy running away down the middle of the street towards a dead-end. I floored it after him and got to the dead-end just as he did

""I ALMOST HAD YOU. DON'T EVER COME BACK. I ALMOST HAD YOU

I got back into my car and went home. I pulled into the driveway and walked through the front door of my house

 ""You never had me.""

I felt like crying. I just dropped the note and sat down on the floor where I was standing. The note floated down and landed next to me face-down. On the back I saw that it said one more thing that will probably haunt me for the rest of my life:

Ok, which escapes me at the moment). Here are some fun facts about him that I learned over the years-

1. Creeky lived in a 3-story victorian style house that was in the middle of a small lot of land which had an 8-foot

2. In his yard, to seriously valuable classic cars (the only one I can remember is a '64 1/2 Mustang Convertible, which I wanted even if it probably smelled like cat piss). All of these cars, regardless of value, were never driven, and left to rot. He wouldn't sell them to anyone (people tried to buy them fairly often).

3. For every car Creeky owned, and 7-20 dogs. On half an acre of land. 

4. Even though Creeky was breaking several property laws, and the local town council wanted to purchase this land from him, so they didn't want to piss him off....also, he was creepy as fuck, so I'm sure that had something to do with it too. 

5. One of the only places he would ever go was the local grocery store where my dad works. Unless you asked him a question, grapes, and a 12 pack of Pepsi and pay for everything with a $100 bill (I worked there one summer, and those were literally the only things he ever bought). Then he would go out back and take all of the banana crates that were sitting in the dumpster. (Eventually my dad started leaving them out for him in a stack because he caught him trying to crawl into the box crusher)

6. In about 2001, although he would occasionally would stay in an RV he had purchased and parked in the front yard. In 2009, his house burned down, so he lived in his cars and RV all the time. Sometimes at night, you'd see him sitting in a car with the engine running if it was cold outside. 

About a year and a half ago, and had no idea what needed to be done before selling it. Knowing my obsession with weird shit, my dad calls and asks if I want pictures or a ""souvenir"", and I scream ""YES!!!!!"". I totally would have gone, but I live out of state now. 

So my dad puts on his rubber fly-fishing waders, and goes to check out the property. Basically all that's left is a pile of the burned house, several shells of burned classic cars, and the RV. In several of the non-burned cars, my dad finds mummified bags of ""pets"", including the one car that Creeky slept in. He then goes into the RV, and finds piles of the banana crates with the lids on them. On each box, and realizes that each box contains a mummified dog or cat that Creeky had owned. There were DOZENS of them. He also found some in the fridge. I asked him if he was worried that he'd find a dead human body

Keep in mind that these pictures were taken about 3 days after Creeky was forced into a rest home. Also
