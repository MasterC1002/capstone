When NCAA 98 came out

Fast forward, family of my own and my dad sends me a text asking, ""When we go on vacation next month, do you want me to bring your playstation and NCAA 98?"" I told him to kiss my ass. I will never forget every time I see or hear the name Danny Wuerffel, I picture taking NCAA98 out of the case and getting ready for a stomping.

We have been bringing this with us to every vacation since I can remember. We save it for a rainy day at the beach or just too damn lazy to get out of the condo one day. I missed two family vacations while I was in the Marine Corps.

We have both pre-ordered the PS4 through amazon. Hopefully pass something as comical down to my son someday.

I had PS+ so it turned out a great deal for me because it was $28 in the PSN store and was discounted 50% so I got it for $14. I checked gamestop and they have it for $40 on new and $38 on pre-owned.

But here's the thing: I only bought the one for PS3. But apparently

So not only I got a huge savings on it

Was it always like this with PSN? If so

This is an idea that I hope you

A very small feature that should be on PlayStation is the ability to go offline. A simple edition to the types of status you can put

Why you may ask? Why would anyone want to appear offline?
First

SECOND, is privacy. You see, I have lots of friends (in real life) that have the PlayStation. In fact, almost all my friends list is all people i know in real life. While its nice to play with friends, we all have days that we just want to play by ourselves. For me, what happens is that I get a game invite since I appear on but I really don't feel like playing with him/her. Keep in mind that its not that I hate them, it's just I want to play by myself.

I'm forced to ignore or make an excuse saying that its not really me and I'm someone else using my console. It's not a good feeling overall. 

I would like to ask if Sony implements this feature onto the PS3

I hope this gets talked a lot and eventually get the eye of Sony to recognize and implement this.

Thank you and please feel free to post your comments and thoughts below! :D

Game 1
It was a side-scroller with the main character being able to shoot out lightning I think to pick up enemies or crates to move them around and put them into meat grinder like things or slam them around until they died. The level selection screen was like a solar system with planets getting progressively bigger or smaller. (I don't remember which.)
Game 2 
The only thing I remember was that you were some kind of animal (not sure) that moved through realm like places and they all had missions that you had to accomplish to progress to the next one.

I sold my PlayStation 2 with a game or two years ago at a garage sale and I really regret it. 

I looked on eBay and it looks like I can pick up a used PS2 for between $30 and $60 plus shipping. I haven't looked to see how much the games are going for yet. The pros of buying a used system is being able to play the other PS2 games I kept(I used to own a backwards compatible PS3) and being able to buy other PS2 games if I felt like it. The con is it would be more expensive than just buying the downloadable ones.

The cost of buying the downloadable games from the PS store for my PS3 would be $10 each. The pros of buying the downloadable games are the cost and instant gratification. 

So whatcha think?

1. Does the mounting bracket you have to buy support 2.5 and 3.5"" drives?
2. Does the PS3 support HDD's over 7200rpm?
3. Are SSD's actually a bad choice due to the amount of (guessing) read/writing the Playstation does?
4. How would you transfer content from an existing PS3 HDD to a user-replaced HDD?
5. Once the HDD has PS3 specific content on it
6. How does the PS3 handle the HDD -&gt; PS3 connection? Is it like a SATA cable
7. How big are game installs usually? (This would give me an idea of going SSD or HDD)

So it was a fighting game but not a 1-on-1 fighter, 1 normal dude and one buff motherfucker, as far as I remember the buff dude is wearing a white tank-top. While playing you can pick up objects and throw them at enemies, you can roll around and dodge shit, I think you can also beat the shit out of a wending machine and drink the sodas that fall out to regain HP. The game can be played either in local co-op or alone. Also the camera is not from the side but also not from the top as in first GTA games, the view is very similar to games like Bastion.

Do I need external memory card for PSN titles?  
  
What games are ""must"" (I have PS+ so I have gotten some games already)?  
  
Are all PSP

First of all
 
The PS3 connects to the internet via WiFI and is hooked up to my TV by an HDMI cable.
 
Ive never had an issue until Sunday (April 28, it fails and just shuts off. My dads friend did a factory reset to the TV which got it working... UNTIL i played with my PS3 and turned it off. 
 
I thought it was the TV at first but then I moved it my Flatscreen TV (which never had any problems
 
My wall TV is still having problems failing to turn on and after this incident
 
Ive never had any problems with this before or any device/console and this is the PS3 causing the problem as my new TV (the flatscreen) never had problems and always worked perfectly until I plugged my PS3 in.
 
Can anyone help me with this? I dont want a $250 black brick on my table. 
 
EDIT: Just more information to help after trying to find a solution (didnt find any yet)
-I bought mine the USA
-Im living in the USA
-My PS3 account is in the same region where I live in (USA)
-It has never been jailbroken or hacked before
-Its not a used console

Just want to say that THIS IS NOT A TROLL IN ANYWAY! IM BEING SUPER SERIOUS!

My TV problems started happening on Sunday as I said. My main TV (the wall TV) was the first one to hit this problem. I thought it was because my TV was getting old UNTIL i plugged my PS3 into my other TV (Flatscreen) and it started experiencing weird issues (such as not working correctly) so it has to be from my PS3
 
Here
 
First TV - Wall TV - Main TV

Never had anything like this before. What happens is that it powers on normally and usually the blank screen comes up (depending on what HDMI its on, just still dark. After about 20 seconds, it powers off and a red light blinks on and off for a couple seconds
 
Second TV - FlatScreen

Again, nothing. Unplugged the TV power and the PS3 from the TV and replugged the TV power (NOT THE PS3!) and... IT WORKED!

Imagine how many users lied their age in able to purchase with their PSN account. Some of the winners in the Uncharted 2 competition probably weren't at the minimum age.

I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit for this post, more related to my room's ventilation than anything else. When I first turn the PS3 on, the fans are at ""level 1,"" or nearly silent. They jump up to ""level 2"" after about five minutes idling on the XMB, and then to ""level 3"" when I load a game. After about half an hour of gameplay, they ramp up to ""level 4,"" and very occasionally to ""level 5, or should I look into clearing it out? My room is slightly warm - I'm getting a window unit soon - but it doesn't seem to trouble my desktop PC. Then again

The second problem is more annoying. I've started getting random bursts of static, but it is frequent enough to disrupt the experience completely. It happens whether or not I'm going anything. I've tried plugging the PS3 directly into my monitor, instead of using my HDMI switch, but the problem persists. The strange thing is that I have been using this switch since I bought the system, and the problem has only cropped up within the last week or so.

I'd appreciate any advice on either of these issues.

It successfully loaded but the game would not progress past the in game loading screen. So I once agian shut the machine down and then tried to load it again. However

At this time I have run through all of the options with the last one being a system restore to factory settings. The machine will still not load and when I start it up all that happens is it will show the background waves but the menu options will not show up. I am then forced to hardboot it to turn it off.

On one hand, stay fresher and not as outdated years from now. The PS4 is also a lot more powerful than the PS3 so in theory, the game should perform better.

But on the other hand, the don't even compare to what developers are able to coax out of the systems nowadays. So I feel like the game might not perform as well on the PS4 graphics and performance wise. At least not the launch-games if the developers started working on the games for the current gen before they knew about the new genand received a dev kit.
