1366213605.0,1cjdqo,How can this be legal? Nightmare neighbour/developer ruined my backyard,ReverseClock,119,18,161,"I live on a street with modest sized houses. Bungalows and small 2 story dwellings. 
Last year the bungalow next door was sold. Our new neighbour was a charismatic gentleman in his 50s who quickly ingratiated himself with my family.
He told us he would be knocking down the existing house and rebuilding.  Over the coming weeks he gained our trust and began asking for small
favours during the construction process, the damage was done.

As if things couldn't get worse, on the other side of his house, 
or inconspicuously between our houses. However
to have an outdoor dinner that was once a joy for us. 

Despite the fact that my house lost a significant amount of property value

Now I am desperately looking for a creative solution to some of the above problems

Is there a way to at least partially block his view out of that window? A tree will no longer fit there

Is there a smart way to dampen the effects of that AC unit?

1370272313.0,1fl1mv,HOW-TO Recaulk a Shower Door,rhinoesq,49,8,15,"Found this on an old DIY forum

Recaulking bathtubs is probably one thing that perplexes more homeowners than any other job. One thing that people should realize is that silicone caulk can be difficult to remove if you don't know how to do it

It's because people don't know how to remove old silicone caulk COMPLETELY that their new silicone caulk doesn't stick well, which is likely going to result in trying to caulk a wet joint which will yield predictable results. Garbage in, garbage out.

If you remove the old silicone caulk COMPLETELY

This post is in 4 parts:
1. How to remove old Silicone caulk
2. What silicone caulk to buy
3. How to place new silicone caulk
4. How to clean mildewed silicone caulk

1. How to remove old silicone caulk:
The way to do this is to first remove as much as you can by mechanical means. This means scraping as much as you can off with a razor

Next, get some strips of paper towel wet with the stuff, drape them over the silicone caulk and cover with Saran Wrap for an hour or two to prevent the paper towel strips from drying out.

Web page showing Silicone-Be-Gone:
http://shop2.aol.ca/shop/product--ca...d_3298009.html

Neither Silicone-Be-Gone nor mineral spirits will ""dissolve"" cured silicone

After leaving that Silicone-Be-Gone sit for another hour or two

After scrubbing with the Scotchbrite pad, and then rinse the area with clean water. There should be little silicone left, but any that is left will prevent the new silicone caulk from sticking at that spot, so we need a way to confirm that there is ABSOLUTLEY NO residual silicone caulk remaining.

Remember that the Silicone-Be-Gone makes the silicone caulk swell up and get soft. Get a small quantity (a photographic container full is plenty for one bathtub) of a very fine powder (like Portland Cement, and then rub the powder with your finger.

If there is any residual silicone caulk remaining, the powder will be wiped cleanly off the tub by your finger.

Mark the spots where the sticking of the powder reveals the existance of silicone caulk with masking tape or something
Once the powder doesn't stick anywhere

2. What Silicone caulk to buy:
Silicone caulks come in different price ranges. The more expensive caulks will contain more mildewcide, they will stick better and cure to a stronger rubber than the regular silicone caulks.

However, so you can keep any silicone caulk clean, not just the better ones. 

3. How to place the new silicone caulk:

Use masking tape (1/2 or 3/4 inch wide) to mask off the joint you're wanting to caulk. Use 3/4 or even 1 inch wide masking tape if you have little experience caulking. Put the edge of the tape about 1/4 inch away from the joint on both sides of the joint. That means stopping the tape about 1/4 inch from any vertical joints you want to caulk as well. This can be done by gripping a single edge razor blade in a pair of needle nose style locking pliers. Put the tape in place and then put the edge of the razor firmly on the masking tape

(If you do a lot of caulking

Before putting the new silicone in place

Squeeze out the new caulk onto the joint and wipe it down with a dry finger so that it's relatively uniform in thickness all along the joint. Don't let so much caulk accumulate on your finger that it starts getting on the tub or tile on the OTHER side of the masking tape. At this stage

Once you've got the new silicone caulk reasonably uniformly distributed along the joint

Give the new silicone caulk a few minutes to ""skin over"". This is a good time to mix up a 50/50 solution of liquid dish washing detergent and water.

""Tool"" the new silicone caulk with the diluted soap solution. The soap in it will both act as a lubricant and will prevent the silicone from sticking to your finger. Basically the procedure is to dip the ends of the thumb, rub your fingers together, and wipe a 6 to 9 inch length of the new silicone caulk fairly lightly to give it a concave shape. Then, rub your finger tips together again to reload your working finger with more soap solution and do another 6 to 9 inches or so. Keep going, rubbing your finger tips together to soap up your working finger tip. As you do this, soap will come off your finger and coat the silicon caulk. After you do the whole joint, you can run your finger from one end of it to the other just to ensure it's more or less uniform.

Also, you can simply add a little more caulk to that area and spread it as best you can. I can't explain why it sticks with the soap solution on the existing caulk, but it does. If you put on too much, scrape off the excess with a putty knife or something.

Allow the silicone caulk to cure overnight and you can shower the next day. Don't put any shampoo bottles near it for the first 2 or 3 days

4. How to clean mildewed silicone:

Mix up some baking soda with straight bleach to make a paste that you can spread with a tea spoon (even a plastic tea spoon). (I use a small oval painting spatula that you can buy in art supply stores for painting with thick ""paste"" style paints that come in tubes.)

Use a putty knife to scoop the bleach/baking soda paste out of the mixing container and hold it near the silicone caulk. Scrape the paste onto the silicone caulk and spread it with the teaspoon.

Cut Saran Wrap (or any clear food wrap that will stick to tub and tile) into 4 to 6 inch wide (or so) strips and put them over the paste so it doesn't dry out

When you pull the Saran Wrap off and remove the paste

You'll find when you're doing this that the baking soda settles out of the bleach so that it'll be necessary to continually mix the paste up before scooping some out. If you're doing a vertical or joint on a ceiling, it's not as effective at killing mildew than regular bleach which is 6.25 percent NaOCl.

I save the old paste and reuse it. Just add some more bleach and mix it up,,False,self,t5_2ql97,False,,True

I found this last night

Here are a few things that you can do with the loan-
 
* Make your home more energy efficient
* Small kitchen/bathroom remodels
* Replacing windows/gutters
* Replacing HVAC system to a new

You can either get a ""streamlined"" loan up to $35, but I haven't looked into it as much.

I have been so worried that we will be stuck having to come up with the funds right out of pocket and thus would be unable to do any repairs until wayyyy down the road. Which is a scary thought when he furnace is 59 years old

Multiple plumbers, and even a guy from a restoration company who was referred to us as ""the smell wizard"" have smelled the odor and been unable to place it.  It's been confirmed not to be sewer gas, natural gas, dead animal, or ozone.  It definitely has an organic pungency to it, and I sometimes refer to it as ""eau de dead guy"". One guy thought it might be gases from a rotting tree stump under the basement, but 63 years is a long time for it to still be rotting.

Our attempts to control the smell so far have consisted of:

* Sprayed lots of bleach water into the open tops of the cinder block wall the smell is emanating from
* Sprinkled lots of baking soda into the open tops of the cinder block wall
* Attempted to plug open tops with fiberglass batt inside plastic bags
* Nailed up wire mesh over the top of the cinder block wall and sealed with cement.
* Closed inlet valve from old
* Removed condensate trap from said steam system and capped inlet pipe at the valve.
* Disconnected the condensate pipe that runs below the slab from the condensate trap at the front of the house to the vent stack at the back of the house
* Cut said pipe at floor level at both ends and capped with hydraulic cement. 
* Cemented one end and capped off other end of the copper pipe that evidently replaced the below-slab condensate pipe at some point between 1950 and 1973.
* Dug through the bone-dry dirt on the crawlspace side of the wall, old disposable silverware, etc., and completely freaked out when I found what turned out to be a chicken bone from 1950 (""Oh shit! Mafia graveyard!"").

**The costs: $160 total**

**$80 from Home Depot**

* 12 1x4x8 common-board planks (around $5 each)
* 1 6ft 2x4
* Drawer slides
* Stain
* Polyurethane

**$80 from Ikea**

* 2 EXPEDIT bookshelves

As you can see from the before pic I started living in my new place with a plastic fold up table. I had been looking at Restoration Hardware and Pottery Barn but every large decent desk was $500-$1000. I got some inspiration from Pinterest and knew I could save some money. 

I stared by cutting the boards down to 90"" wide, could save a lot of time by not including a drawer. I used around 100 nails and had access to to nail gun (a must).

Next I sanded it

I have a custom built large PC so I used the Ikea bookshelves to house my PC on the right side and stash my stuff on the left. 

All in all I am very happy with the results.

http://imgur.com/a/0vQzN


**Project Details**

My wife and I are having a baby in July and decided to add some extra storage to the baby's room. This closet had a shelf

We trashed the doors and painted the inside of the closet white. I designed the system to have 13"" tall shelves so they can accept storage baskets from either target or ikea. I bought 3 8' X 4' sheets of 3/4"" MDF from lowes and had them rip them into 13"" boards (with a 10"" board at the end to be used on other projects). We primed and painted each board in our basement before I made any cuts.

I then used the cut list I created and my circular saw to cut the boards to size. We glued each joint and used 2 or 3 screws to keep everything sturdy. We ended up adding a 4 extra 13"" X 13"" pieces on the bottom shelf to support the two vertical shelves. We decided to stagger them because we like the way it looked.

I glued and screwed the vertical shelves to the bottom shelf. I then used an L bracket on the left vertical tower to hold everything to the wall. I reused the old metal hanger bar which added extra support.

**Cost Info**

In case anyone was wondering the total cost of this project was about $140:

* (3) 8' X 4' Sheets of MDF @ $33 each = $100
* (1) 1lb box of 2"" screws = $6
* (1) gallon white paint  = $25
* (1) liquid nails = $3 
* (1) closet rod = free for me (or $10)

I've got a copper water pipe for my mains in a house built in '55. 
my (good) clamp meter reads between 3 and 8 amps going thru the pipe

Most of the wiring in this house was done by me, no grounds used for power carrying. The remaining original wire is 12/2, no ground, the old fibery stuff. There isn't much left of it, i've ripped most of it out. It wasn't actually in bad shape tho, it was plastic jacketed wire with a fiber outer, and all the plastic i saw was okay. 

I'm trying to figure out what's going on here

1) turn off breakers one by one. No single circuit contributes more than a quarter amp to the pipe.

2) turn off the mains power at the main breaker. The amperage thru the pipe drops to 2 amps still! Whowhatwherehow???

3) disconnect ground wire from water pipe and measure voltage drop between the ground bus and copper pipe: .06 volts. This doesn't mean there isn't another point elsewhere where the ground is tied to a water pipe - i'd bet there is

Today, and the basement master bathroom complete runs from upstairs water.  The downstairs line feeds the unused upstairs hot water tank and downstairs cold water, and had a few new Ts in to upstairs bathrooms from a previous plumber working on the upstairs remodel.  We switched those... Hm, the upstairs kitchen is still on this downstairs line... Figured out where to switch that and get the downstairs master bath swapped in instead.  We have it dialed down to one downstairs toilet still on the upstairs line, and it's pretty obvious where to patch that.

Proposed change: http://imgur.com/PZb94Ho

We have just bought a 100-year-old fixer-upper row-house. The top floor was always a separate apartment, is a pain.

We want to combine it with the rest of the house by making a doorway in the stairway wall at the point where it's level with the 2nd floor of the rest of the house (see amateurish diagram). There is a single extra-deep stairstep there

My plan is to open the wall at that point. There's a corridor on the other side. A door would have to be wider than the depth of the stair (which is about 30cm / 1')

We have no need for the stairs below this doorway (except for storage of bikes and stollers

A contractor checked into this and said it would not be a fire code issue since it doesn't change the number of exits from any given point,000) that I am thinking I should attempt it myself.

The DIY store sells doors prehung in frames for $150. Surely I can manage the other $9850 worth of work somehow. I know how to work with tools

Two complications:

* The walls are made of reed and plaster (see photo above) which I have no experience with.
* The house has had some subsidence over the years and there are no 90° angles anywhere. We are planning to have the foundation reinforced but that will take a while and we really need the door ASAP.

Here are the building techniques that have been presented to us:    

• Rigid foam glued to the concrete wall with 2x4 studs glued flat to the concrete wall in between.  The rationale was maximizing living space.    

• 2x4 stud framing up against the concrete wall with insulation batts in between    

• 2x4 stud framing 1 inch away from the concrete wall with insulation batts in between.    


    


None of these options are in line with what I have read on [This Old House](http://www.thisoldhouse.com/toh/video/0,00.html) or [GreenBuildingAdvisor.com](http://www.greenbuildingadvisor.com/blogs/dept/musings/how-insulate-basement-wall) or other sites I have researched.  Nobody has brought up spray foam insulation.    



    

Am I just being obsessive/compulsive?  I really liked one contractor until he told me he would glue 2x4 studs right onto the concrete.  But, and I don't want to be a dick and insist on a certain way of homebuilding when I don't really know what I'm talking about.

I bet many people here have had to deal with at least one lath and plaster wall if they have older houses. Not only are the walls non-flat

I finally managed to find an anchor that works in lath and plaster -- it's called a [toggle bolt](http://0.tqn.com/d/homerepair/1/5/7/4/-/-/toggle_molly.jpg) ~~or molly~~! It's a bolt that screws into a pair of spring-loaded metal ""wings."" You drill a hole in the wall and insert the bolt into the hole. The wings fold up as it enters the hole, creating a securely anchored bolt.

I went through several other options before the toggle type finally worked. First I tried those self-drilling [screw-in plastic](http://www.lemurzone.com/rfg/wp-content/uploads/walldriller.jpg) drywall anchors. They don't work because they can't penetrate the lath boards behind the plaster. DO NOT use the self-drilling plastic drywall anchors in lath and plaster!

I'm not sure if it's mold, mildew, or efflorescence?",Whatsdat_Basement,23,14, but when I read up on it it seemed like mold is unlikely to grow on concrete walls.  Now I think it may be efflorescence but I'm not sure how to eliminate the moisture problem that is causing it to grow.  I have had a dehumidifier running down there for a couple of years and I have to empty it about every other day and it fills up more when it rains.

I have measured how far the affected area spread out on the basement wall and it is almost the exact same length of a small pond that is outside.  The pond is about a foot and a half away from the exterior of the basement wall.  I am not sure if this is a coincidence or not because the basement wall did not start to have a growth on it until a couple years after the pond was put in.  I would hate to fully get rid of the pond as I would just be trying to eliminate things that could be the problem when I'm not sure what is really causing the growth.

I am thinking of taking out the rocks that are around the pond and putting in dirt and plants to try and soak up more rainwater and moisture from the ground.  Do you think this would help or does the pond seem to be the main source of moisture? There is also a porch to the right of the pond that I was thinking of putting a side gutter on to help stop rain from just dropping straight down on the rocks below it.  Does anyone have any ideas or thought on this?  I really appreciate it

You should also look for a washer that heats only the water that it needs to run, reducing drying time, so look for a machine with 900 rpm or more. A pedestal for your washer is a nice feature, too. It gives you storage space under the machine and raises the washer so that you don’t have to bend over to get clothes out.

Refrigerator
****************
When you are buying a new refrigerator, or a bottom freezer. Side-by-sides are the most fashionable and expensive choice, equipped with two full height doors. A top freezer is the least expensive and the most efficient in terms of space and energy. Bottom freezers are mid-priced. The main appeal of a bottom freezer is that the refrigerator contents are located at eye level, so you don’t have to bend over to see what’s in the fridge.

When choosing a refrigerator

Dishwasher
****************
Dishwashers can vary greatly in price, this isn’t the place to skimp, either. A $200 dishwasher likely won’t get your dishes very clean, and you’ll end up washing dishes by hand or replacing your new dishwasher pretty quickly. A standard sized dishwasher will hold 12 place settings; if you have a big family or find that you run your dishwasher very often, consider upgrading to a larger tub. Features to look for in a dishwasher include adjustable racks and cycles designated specifically for sanitizing, cleaning delicate glassware, or short cycles.

Stove
****************
The big decision is gas versus electric when you are buying a new stove. The current setup of your kitchen can be the deciding factor, look for convection and steam capabilities and warming drawers.",,False,self,t5_2ql97,False,,

Can I build a few small plantars/terraces to eliminate this problem? I was thinking something built with wood rather than stone, each at a slightly lower grade than the other.  *I think this would look nicer personally*

**Option 3**: I could put down cheap OSB plywood

A majority of the house has 2 layers of wall paper which has been painted over 3 times. I spent several hours pulling down wall paper and was only able to remove a small section. Even after sanding, the plaster will behind the paper is damaged although not to the point where it can't be repaired. I should be able to reattach it to the lathe and fill the cracks where needed. The baseboards and door have some minor damage and were very poorly painted by a previous owner so they'll have to be sanded and repaired. In short if I choose to keep the walls I'll have to pull down several layers of paint and paper, repair and smooth the walls, repair the baseboards and window/door frames.

The other option is to tear down the plaster and replace it with dry wall. The main advantages to this are that overall, I feel like there is more risk in tearing down the walls then there is with simple repairing the existing walls.

I was hoping that /r/homeimprovment could weigh in. I'm especially interested in how messy/difficult tearing down a plaster wall is and the difficulty/cost involved with putting up dry wall.

That said...

Home is built on a corner at the peak of a gentle slope increasing to probably something similar to a 12/12 grade where it meets the north sidewalk.

Previous owner put a hedge at the peak and covered the slope with light rip/rap and ivy.

Basically I want to put a retaining wall on the north property bordering the sidewalk getting rid of the ivy and providing a better foundation for some fencing that will be replaced in the next phase.

Have not done the actual measurements yet

So much of the DIY materials are that ""stack-able-stone"".

Assuming ""stack-able-stone"" also means ""mortar-less""...

Is that the right material for this application?

It seems possible to me that these were meant for ""lighter"" applications and that the weight of the yard behind the wall could be a problem.

Any thoughts?

Sprinkler System - we are on a corner lot and its a huge pain in the ass to water. Will need about 8 zones @ 400 bucks is the bench mark plus a regrade in one part of the front yard.

Pros - Instant street appeal with a good looking yard.
Cons - Increase in money spent on yard upkeep

Electrical Service Update - 1955 Ranch with two 50 amp services in a closet to a 200-400 amp outdoors (code) service . Luckily no aluminum wires in the house. Quotes range from 2400-3500 including adding 6 GFCI plugs

Pros - Will future proof for any remodels. House is incredibly dim and needs complete redo of lighting.
Cons - No curb appeal

Kitchen Remodel - Completely original 1955 kitchen counter top, the kitchen and the bathrooms need to be made modern for both us and future buyers. Cabinets are in good shape, need to be stripped and painted, can sell oven (folks collect them) and do a oven/range combo to save space. Already did the floor.

Pros - Little investment for big return. Will have huge impact on interior of house and give a more refined feeling for the  home. Plus im the cook and it will make my life better.
Cons - We need to completely redo ceiling in the kitchen. Worried that adding recessed lighting (there is none currently) will push us over what our weak-ass 100 amp service can handle. Moving the oven to where the range is will create more space but also means that we need to do the counter top/range/oven move all at the same time.

We aren't looking to sell at any time in the near future but want to make sure we focus on making quality upgrades that increase overall equity in the home.

I am leaning sprinkler system since this has the biggest immediate impact but then again you can almost never go wrong with kitchen work.

Other things that need to be done

New Roof (come on hail storm!)
New Windows
Paint
Front porch remodel
Fence strip and paint
Bathrooms/Closet Remodel
Painting
Security Lighting
Garage redrywall (water damage)

**This is going to be a very long winded post

I posted in this sub a few weeks back seeking some advice and opinions on [gable fans](http://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/1hdo7o/need_advice_on_automatic_gable_fans/). Someone recommend that I should just install new windows instead.... Having 20+ year old original construction aluminum dual pane windows

However I'm a bit confused on a few of the particulars and I'm hoping the hivemind can help fill those gaps! 

There seems to be a real lack of comprehensive how-to's for window installation online... for whatever reason. I've watched countless videos on YouTube and have read a few terrible articles on various sites and bought the Black &amp; Decker book from Amazon on windows and doors (which only covers DIY installation briefly). The consensus seems to be that the details of window installation (New construction or replacement) seems to be that it varies greatly by project. Depending on your window style, requiring you to removing the inside trim. While other windows are installed from the outside and I'm unsure which I need or should get.

**Point of confusion #1**
&gt;My house has T1-11 siding and getting access to the windows nail strips is very easy. [Here is what it looks like with my trim removed](http://imgur.com/JRqUZQK). I'm uncertain if I should go for new construction windows or replacement windows.
 My understanding is that replacement windows will not require me to remove the existing aluminum frame or nail strip
([Second view of trim removed](http://i.imgur.com/tXHfcum.jpg))

**Point of confusion #2**
&gt; Depending on the consensus of the above question

**Point of confusion #3**
&gt; How and where to buy DIY replacement windows. I've found an online shop that caters to DIYers called the [WindoweStore](http://www.windowestore.com) but I've not been able to find much feedback about them anywhere. Anyone have any experience with them or have a recommendation on where to order? Overall it sounds like the ""big"" name brands are typically overpriced for what you get and I'd rather avoid the cheaper windows you can get from Home Depot

So I have more questions

I'm also going to x-post this to /r/DIY

Anyway

During the day

A bit more detailed: on really hot days (90's)

The problem is getting my indoor humidity levels down.  I have a Nest thermostat that I installed a week ago and can monitor the humidity levels at any time.  I've noticed that during the day, it has only goes down into the mid 50's.  (Mind you, I've only been tracking this for a week and it's been pretty hot).  Obviously, indoor humidity that high has me worried about mildew / mold, etc...

Now, we use a fan if it gets uncomfortable.  Off of the downstairs room, we also have the hot water heater and boiler in an enclosed room.  I have not measured the humidity levels down there...but I'm sure it is higher then upstairs because of the lack of cooling.

So here's my question.  Since the lower level is not conditioned

Or is my AC not running enough to lower the humidity?  I've read that lowering the temperature won't help in lowering the humidity and can actually make it higher (and just give us higher electric bills).

Before I call in an AC tech (during the biggest heatwave of the summer...good luck getting one here anytime soon)

Weird thing is that it really doesn't really feel humid inside.  But

Last year I installed additional ventilation ducts (green circles on the diagram) with the intent on using the central air conditioning to cool the basement.  This worked great on the first day, and my central air unit won't come on if the ambient temperature outside is too cool.    As a result, I need a plan to cool the basement with the outside air if it is too cold for the air conditioner to operate.

I have an idea

Use a large box fan, so that air is only going in at that point.  (ie, the box fan is 2' x 2', but the window is about 1' x 2', so i need something to refocus the air so it all goes in the window).

We have had a lot of rain recently

I have a flat roof

It is a 1 story home plus a basement.

There was no pooling when i checked the roof during the inspection

Now
Due to heavy rainfall, creating a vein down the wall.

In the basement

There is also minor leakage on the main floor adjacent to the drainage pipe.

My theory is that the drainage entry point on the roof may not be completely sealed, so that some water end up on the ceilings and floor.

I will be investigating further and having a closer look at the roof when it stops raining. I am thinking of applying sealant around the drain to test if my theory is correct.

Has anyone ever experienced water infiltration like this with a similar roof type? Any other theories? What steps should i take to diagnose and eventually fix this problem?

Notice the discoloration the the left of the paint damage. The drainage pipe pipe is further to the left leading me to believe water is slowly flowing down and meeting a wall before accumulating and causing the damage.

More water dripping down from basement ceiling. This is where most of the water is dripping. Again, water dripping down along the outside of the pipe soaks in the ceiling/flooring. Water here drips on floor and into a drain in basement floor.

The pipe hidden by a wooden column. The edges of the wood here feels damp again leading me to believe water sliding down the outside of the pipe all the way from the roof. The pipe is right next to the wet ceiling in the previous pic.

* Less space consumed by the water heater in the basement as our home is not very large so every square foot counts!

* We are thinking to rent out the basement apartment so it would hopefully eliminate any worries about running out of hot water for folks taking a shower.

* Not having the hot water sitting in a  water tank 

* Cost saving. But looking at [this report](http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/appliances/heating-cooling-and-air/water-heaters/tankless-water-heaters/overview/tankless-water-heaters-ov.htm) does not seem to make much of a case for cost savings by going to a tankless system.

One thought is to cover them with flag stones or something... assuming this can be done.  I'm also wondering about building a set of wooden cascading stairs over them leading down to the patio area.

Anyone here done anything similar

He'll be anchoring the deck to the basement walls which are ARXX insulated concrete forms with double concrete lags

The building code specifies a frost line depth of 48""

The height above grade on the left half of the deck is about 36"" and the height above grade on the right half of the deck is somewhere around 96"" - 100"".

Anchored to the 6x6 posts will be laminated support beams - three 2x10x12s on the left and two 2x8x15s on the right. They are directly anchored to the posts.

The floor trusses are 2x8x12s and 2x6x8s and extend beyond the laminated beams slightly. The decking will be applied horizontally.

1373914499.0,1icvex,COPPER PIPE REPAIR IN CEILING: COMPRESSION or SOLDER,not2oldyet,22,8,23,"I did a brief search for similar questions earlier

Next project our 100yr old house has chosen for us is the plumbing for the 2nd floor bathroom.

Water damage from the leak has already required removing the ceiling from the dining room immediately below.  So rather than attempt to work from the floor above

Age of the home means we are replacing copper.  Right now my attitude is that the size of the repair afford replacing with copper over PVC or PEX.

The new joins are my question however...

Initially I began doing homework on solder.  Supplies, techniques, etc.

All along however I have been a bit intimidated by the torch.  In a more open environment the technique seems very straightforward and little to fear.  Between the 2nd floor beams in the ceiling however I am a bit concerned I have the room to correctly work the torch for the solder without a fire hazard to the surrounding wood work.

Then I began to run into lessons on compression fittings.  This seems a MUCH less hazardous approach and far more in tune with my current skills.  :-)

That led me to ""push-on"" fittings as well.

A few questions for the more experienced among us...

1. How much confidence can one have in compression fittings over solder in the long run?  Obviously I will leave the repair exposed for a little while to be able to assure no leaks come back

2. Compression fittings or ""push on""?  Push on seems to be the far least complicated

3. Copper, but I also know I might be being a little overbearing on this point.  What are some opinions about repairing with PVX instead of copper?

Lastly I saw this...( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRteaB8Z0bA )

1 - running a course of bricks from the corner of the house up the driveway and tapering it smaller as you go up. had a few brick guys look at it and they didn't seem too keen on trying that.

We have two very stupid cats. One of them is extra stupid and tends to be a little pissy (literally and figuratively) about where he chooses to take a leak. Anywhere nearby in the room is close enough, and line the tub with aluminum foil. Since cats hate walking on aluminum foil, The Mad Pisser was forced to use the litterbox. Unfortunately that bathroom is now in use and we needed to relocate.

**Problem:** Cat poop stinks. Two cats seem to generate four times the stink. I don't want to find out what three cats does. Regardless

**Solution:** With several adults living in this house

**Materials:**

1. Home Depot Jeld-Wen folding closet doors, tough cardboard. At least it's light and easy to cut.
2. Rubberized vinyl baseboards. Two at $2.50 each. Combine with some caulk we already had on-hand (probably $2 if you have to buy it) to waterproof the baseboard/floor seam in case of kitty 'accidents'.
3. Linoleum flooring. The actual closet flooring is asbestos tile. I don't want cat claws scratching that up. Got some cheap remnant stuff from a local overstock store for ten or twenty bucks and cut off a little 2x3 piece. Probably a whole dollar's worth of linoleum used.
4. Liquid Nails to secure everything. $3.67.
5. Litter box. $3.
6. Cat door


**Directions:**

1. Paint and replace doors. The Home Depot house brand stuff is white
2. Cut linoleum to fit
3. Cut and glue baseboards. Since they tilt back
4. Caulk all the things! Everything is now waterproof in case of hazmat spills
5. The catbox looks like a $20-30 top entry cat box. It's a $6 storage bin from a big box department store with a hole cut in the top. Cats can't tell the difference.

Since we have stupid cats, we've gotten to a closed cat door that El Stupido will carefully, slowly push open after a great deal of staring and poking.

I'd appreciate your recommendations on a few things related to adding smoke detectors into a new (to me) home. Let me provide some back story that might help a bit to start and wind up with some questions that hopefully you can help with.

Just bought a house that was built in the 70s but has a lot of upgrades. Unfortunately house-wide smoke detectors were not something that was on that list. The house has three levels and I think there's just a handful of them on the first level only. I don't believe they're hardwired and they're ancient. I'd like to look at putting in more smoke detectors throughout the entire house and replacing the old ones altogether. In my mind -- ideally they would be hardwired+9V back-up and by sync'd with one another so if something is going wrong in the basement the alarms would sound up on the third floor. Additionally

I'm happy to say I ignored some of it and went for a flat finish. 

[Here are pictures of the finished product](http://imgur.com/a/fJM8B). 

The project took about 7 days and cost between 125 and 175 for materials and a few new tools (pure materials was 95). The biggest cost was Benjamin Moore primer and paint - I feel they helped me achieve a better finish and were more forgiving on the drywall finishing. 

Scraping the painted texture off took me one evening. The next night I used a sponge and 6"" taping knife to clean the ceiling. I tried to get as much texture and ""crap"" off as possible to get clean drywall without over saturating the drywall. Night two was half the mudding and night three was the second half. This involved going over every screw dimple

Night 4 was a light sanding and scraping

Night 5 was the final sanding - this took me a good deal of time to make sure everything was feathered out properly. I also used a damp sponge and shop vac to collect dust before priming. All dusty floor covering was removed. 

Night 6 was two coats of primer. Inbetween primer coats I used lightweight spackle to cover any fish eyes I noticed or other imperefections that the 1000 watt revealed. 

Night 7 was two coats of flat white ceiling paint.  

I think it turned out very good due to the time I was able to put in. I didn't need the room durning the product so I didn't feel rushed. With standard lighting it looks like a really good

Have a good ladder, pole sander, shop vac with dust bag and proper attachments, and a lot of patience if you want it too look good. 

I feel the time it took was worth it vs buying and hanging new drywall.

I've used Sika sealer along the driveway and against the house, and it looks like water is still getting down there from somewhere, just not as bad as before. I do have a few more places to seal, so hopefully what I've done so far is being effective. 

I've got some Drylok too, refreezing would damage the blocks. Is that a reasonable fear?

I'm just looking for some constructive comments and advice on this kind of project since I absolutely can't afford to have professionals take care of it.

I'm also wondering what it would take to terrace the front yard to eat up most of the grass and plant a bunch of bushes and low maintenance plants

My first thoughts were to just remove it completely but realized I would not have access to the sun shade on the second floor.

What I would like to do is leave a small portion of the deck attached to the house (there is no damage to this part of it) with enough room for me to go out and access the sun shade (sunsetter awning).

The deck has vertical supports 10' away from the house. They are being removed.

My question is how far out could I leave the porch?

How much can those nailed brackets hold?

It would need to support about 220 lbs. (me)

I understand it would not be the safest in the world and it would only be used temporarily until we figure out what to do. I would install a basic rail guard.

The outside would obviously need to be painted, the deck probably has a few years left.

The kitchen is essentially missing. There is a few cabinets left but nothing worth keeping. Because the entire kitchen would need to be replaced I was thinking that I would move it to where a bedroom is currently located it behind it. This would all the current kitchen space to be used as a dining room and in turn make the living room larger. 

The second bedroom on the first floor would stay as a bedroom but would need to be painted.In addition the flooring needs to be replaced (This is true throughout the house). There is a full bathroom on the first floor but I would like to take out the tub and install a standup shower and small closet for storage. 

The second floor is in the best shape. Everything is liveable now but the interior doors would need to be replaced (Again this is true with the entire house). I would eventually like to turn one of the two bedrooms in to a restroom since there is not one. I would think that I could have the plumbing run as the kitchen is being relocated. 

The basement is finished and in decent shape for the 70's but the half bath would need to be redone and the basement itself needs to be refinished and updated. 

It looks like the house is going to go for about $65k which is great for the neighborhood. I would only have about $10k to start repairs and then I could afford another $750-$1k a month for additional repairs.

So I'm getting the 100A service upgraded to 250A. (Garage service needs upgrading from fusebox, obviously, most of my outlets need replacing (I want ground!), and likely a lot of replacement wiring.

Also going to install a 42U rack in the basement, and I want to replace all the landline jacks with keystone jacks and four cat6e home-ran back to the patch panel in the basement. (The rack is coming to me free from a friend.)

The rack will also be holding home theater gear

Finally, and one on the second floor on the rear. (First covers front of the house, second covers rear of the house and the back yard, and I can reduce tx power for a less-noisy rf environment.)

I've done professional telecom wiring before, and I'm out of date on where to source tools and materials. I'm not a licensed electrician, but I'm perfectly comfortable with low-voltage, high-voltage and RF, and I've done structured residential electrical before. (Wiring on new construction at my parents' place...building my own room.) I'm silly enough to want 20A circuits instead of 15A circuits, even where I can't point to a specific anticipated need.

While I'll be involving some friends with the labor (for all but one of them, but inspecting things (i.e. each jack wired correctly) personally before things get screwed in and out of sight.

So

Questions: 

1. Anything fundamental I'm doing wrong? (Aside from the obvious overengineering. And, given it's structured wiring.)
2. Last time I did anything like this, I'd want to run four and a spare...but five cat6e lines strikes me as stretching how much I could pull at once! If there's a good way to do it, I'd love to. But I'll accept it if there's not, and perhaps find a way to put USB chargers in a couple of the keystone ports.
3. Where's a good place to get several 1000ft boxes of cat6? I don't have a good estimate for how many thousands of feet I'll need yet; I haven't mapped out where all the jacks are.
4. What would you recommend for lube? I recall cable being far
5. Similarly...what about 12ga electrical cable? AFAIK
6. I've never done hidden structured speaker wiring before
7. Preferences on brands for any of the parts involved?
8. Anything I may have missed?

My wife and I saved up some money

I picked the contractor with the best references, and put the vents in the quote. The total quote was 5.9k, plus the cost of the dumpster.

They did my roof yesterday. The work looks amazing – clean lines, new flashing – everything looks great, except they didn’t install the box vents. They told me that my gable vents were enough, even though they’d previously quoted me (it’s on the contract I signed and have a copy of) box vents.

Now I am in this situation – I still owe them 2.5k remaining on the job, given some time.
So my options are 1) Demand the box vents I paid for, just a list of things and one price, so I’m not exactly sure what the size of that refund would be. 

What would you do in this situation? I already called them – they are looking into it and getting back to me

Update: I just got a call from the owner - he said that they modified my gable vents to make them bigger and that should take care of the problem. I'm at work right now, that's not what the contract says. The contract says nothing about modifying my gable vents, and I didn't agree to that. As far as I am concerned, that's work they chose to do for free. The box vents are still a contractual issue that has to be rectified. 

Update 2: They just called me and told me the owner was confused - they didn't modify my gable vents.

When we first looked at the house there was some tile work in the bathroom that was falling in that he said he would repair/replace. Well the work done to ""repair"" it is that he didn't actually fix the wall he just covered over it with a plastic shower siding

Generally the place is relatively dirty and needs some work in other areas, broken window screens, doors that have been seemingly kicked in and patched very poorly, dirt and grime in random places.

EDIT_02: I've emailed my landlord about my concerns. I may be a little naive in how much this will cost


I was at Home Depot yesterday to get some stuff for Spring cleaning/fixes and while I was there I figured I’d look at how expensive a new door would be. Labor cost really outweighs the cost of the actual door. I could get a new vinyl sliding glass door for as cheap as $299 which includes the frame, I could get a more attractive swing-type patio door that doesn’t slide and could maybe last longer since there’s less moving parts involved. I would absolutely be willing to take on this project with my own tools and a friend or two and put in some of my own money as well. I think this would really help on energy costs and be worth it for us in many other ways as well. If I did it, it would also eliminate any labor costs ($469 at Home Depot). I love doing this sort of thing so it would be exciting for me. I of course would need your permission to take on a project of this nature. I don’t want to seem like I’m pressuring at all. The alternative is probably to caulk-seal all of the openings and the entire outer frame of the current setup.  The current frame isn’t really connected to the house. If you pull the door at all while it’s latched, the frame actually moves away from the wall. My original idea was to pull the slider off its track and inspect the rollers. Those can be replaced fairly cheap if I could match them up with something, but given the door’s age it could be difficult to find. But even then, the stationary panel is blocking the slider from being removed. I tried to remove the stationary panel but the house has shifted so much that the clips are bent and after removing them I cannot get the panel to budge. It may be bearing the structural load from above or else it’s just really seized in there. This, however, but I’d rather not do that in the summer because the deck is one of the most appealing features of the house in my opinion. Like I said

I took a couple pictures of the bottom-of-the-line Home Depot doors. I also called the Habitat for Humanity “restore” in ~~[omitted]~~ and he said he thinks he has a sliding glass door, but I lack a vehicle capable of moving something like that and would need to find someone with a truck. I may know someone, though.

It seems like my basement should've been water-proofed before it was finished, I think I'd like to hire a professional to inspect my foundation to confirm there are no issues, then hire a landscaping company to build a french drain and re-grade my lawn near the house.

Does this sound like a reasonable plan?  What type of professional would I hire to inspect my foundation? Any idea how much the inspection would cost? Any other recommendations on how to address this problem?

Need a lot of help learning.,rocklawbster,13,1,36,"I'm going to be replacing the galvanized pipe in my house entirely with PEX in 2 phases. The first phase will go something like this (working from the main shutoff towards the water heater):

1. Cut and remove pipe on the house side of the main shut off valve
2. Cut and cap the hot water supply line to the kitchen sink (which is right near where water comes into the house
3. Add a pressure regulator just after the main shutoff valve
4. Add a isolation valve just after the pressure regulator (recent addition to this plan
5. Add an expansion tank
6. T to a hose bib
7. T off to an in-line point of use water heater for the kitchen sink.
8. T off for cold water supply to the kitchen sink
9. Continue cold water supply to the point where I cut the pipe off.

Everything in phase 1 is done in the garage- and all of this plumbing is more or less exposed right now.

Phase 2 encompasses replacing the remaining plumbing in the whole house with PEX, washing machine, 1 utility sink and 1 additional toilet) and switching to an in line water heater for the rest of the house. Almost all of this work is very accessible in a utility room.

Questions I have:

*What do I need to do to couple the PEX to the existing galvanized in the current system?

I am currently building a ""man cave"" in my basement and in the process I have created a furnace room. My house is about 7 years old and I am the original owner.

In my furnace room there is a pipe (exhaust pipe) that doesn't have insulation between it and the wall.

[Exhibit 1](http://i.imgur.com/NVSdr.jpg)

The pipe feels cool to the touch even when the furnace is running so I am unsure why the builders didn't insulate behind it. It could just be an oversight by them.

[Exhibit 2](http://i.imgur.com/zmIbE.jpg)

[Exhibit 3](http://i.imgur.com/fFxRv.jpg)

I'd like to insulate behind this pipe. Can anyone think of any reason not to? Is it bad if the insulation touches the pipe itself?

Not sure if it matters but I'm in Alberta

Let me know if more details are required.

Here's what I had planned to do but I thought I'd run it by you all:
 
-On the outside of the gable

-Using a small drill bit

-From attic side

-Use a 4"" hole saw to place a hole in the wood

-Remove wood

-Insert vent from the outside and bolt it in

I was thinking a hole saw might be a bit rough on the siding. Do you guys agree? The only alternative I could think of is drilling several holes around the circle with a drill bit and manually sawing out a circle between the holes.

For what it's worth I'm not sure how old the vinyl siding is. I live in MA/USA and I can pull up some pictures when I get home if you think it will help!

some hopefully relevant info:

house is in Eastern Mass

soil is mostly clay/sand

we hope to have a walk-out entrance to it in the back.

it's about 20ft above water table.

there is one chimney which extends into the basement.

general area of basement would be around 1k feet.

old ""filled in"" well head exists in basement.  or i'm guessing that's what it is.

We also hope to completely replace the floor in the room above the existing basement area, and heating...  We thought mayb doing this WITH the foundation replacement would save cost...somehow..?

How do I cover up the chalkboard paint? Is there a good way / method to select a paint that will closely match the existing color on the adjacent walls so I don't have to re-paint everything? I checked everywhere in the unit and can't find any of the original wall paint.

What would you guys suggest: laying down more concrete and sealing that space along the wall where the new cement meets the foundation?

Some kind of a frame for my bed (I only have a mattress and I'm entirely too old to sleep on a mattress on the floor).

More shelving space in my closet (The only storage in my closest are a few wire racks).

Attempting to fix up a basement work room to a hobby room and I need help and suggestions!,zombienoms,11,0,22,"In my otherwise finished basement we have one room approx 16 feet long by 8 foot wide with 8-9 foot tall ceilings.  I'm looking to fix the room up to make a hobby room for my father.  I have little to no DIY experience and this would be my first major project.  The attached album is pictures of the room.  For ease I've divided the parts of the project 

-2 walls (and a small part of a 3rd) are cinderblock which from my untrained eye and research appears to be covered in stucco which over the years has decayed so the stucco is crumbling off and some of the blocks underneath appear to be in need of repair.  There seems to be some discoloration but I don't believe it to be water damage as the room has never had indicators or problems with moisture.  The wall is divided into a upper and lower half with a 1 inch lip about 4 and 1/2 feet from the floor.  I have scraped some off the lip and it seems that it was made using a piece of wood cemented and stuccoed into place.  In addition to the blocks themselves with uneven face from decay there are also places where the seams have cracked so there are holes between the blocks.

-Wood Wall 1:  The wall is about 4 feet wide and starts at the ground but ends a few feet from the ceiling.  This wall is just kind of unsightly but doesn't seem to have any major problems with it.  Just the same it is aged and I want to replace it.  At the base there is a gray cross beam bracing the wall with the door frame

-Wood wall 2:  This wall is the one that I am most apprehensive about getting into.  The wood like the other wall seems in good shape albeit it ugly, and therefore I would like to look into redoing it.  The major issue with this wall is that it houses the one light fixture of the room and a circuit box which has many cables that I have no idea what they do coming out of it.  Out of all the parts of this room this is one that I would potentially call in a professional to do depending.

-Floor:  The floor is just a simple concrete it seems.  There's a few pipes coming out of it (big green things in the pics)  But no major hindrances.  There are parts of the floor which are basically scarred up

-Ceiling:  I have absolutely no idea how to handle this


MY PLAN:
Floor:  Use Quickcrete or similar driveway cement repair to smooth out the imperfections

Cinderblock Walls:  Use belt sander, whatever to get old material off walls, clean wall using acid product or the like making sure they're as clean as possible so further treatments take well.  Repair uneven stone using quickcrete concrete/cement repair also filling in gaps between stones with a product.  Redo the shelf between upper and lower wall using a metal form for shape if needed but simply making sure the walls connect with no issue.  Use quickcrete stucco product to finish walls (Followed by prime and paint).  Also there is a defunct rusty pipe sticking out of one wall I was thinking just sand and strip it and paint it?

-Wood Wall 1:  Take down old wood

-Wood wall 2:  Take down what wood i can without messing with electric replace with fresh

-Ceiling:  No idea potentially call someone?


Anyway thank you for reading this if you did I know its long so I'm sorry but any input would be great.  Again I have no real idea what I'm doing I'm simply looking at things online and reading instructions and from what I gather I don't think I'm biting off more than I can chew.  The procedures seem straight forward and kind of hard to mess up.  If I've oversimplified this then please tell me.  I'm open to any suggestions or message me for questions comments I guess.

I had a bit of standing rain water in my basement after some pretty heavy rains. When we bought the house they told us they usually snake it out once a year to help clear out the tree roots.

My question - is it easy enough for me to replace the pipe and trap in my basement (with the help from my neighbor and local plumbing store) or should I shell out the cash to have it done by plumbers?

I live in an apartment and like a lot of apartment dwellers I've been pretty opposed to doing any repairs or home improvement.  I've generally just let things degrade as long as they're functional.  But recently I took a look around my apartment and it just got me depressed.  So much needed to be done.  There were large holes in the wall; the whole place needed paining; the fixtures were falling apart or corroding--I had to do something.

So I thought a lot about getting the building manager involved.  But

From there I just kept going:

* I repaired any holes in the walls and painted the entire apartment from top to bottom
* I rearranged the furniture and bought some new pieces to improve the flow of the space
* Replaced the toilet seat and TP dispenser

Then a bigger decision came up.  The faucet in the bathroom had grown corroded and icky over the years.  The drain actually emitted a vaguely unpleasant odor.  So I bought a replacement faucet and drain even though I know nothing about plumbing.  Turns out

The combination of all the things I've done added up to make me feel a lot better about where I live.  My next project is to replace the faucet in the kitchen with a nice chrome pull-down to replace the one that is literally falling apart.  Total cost of these projects so far is right around  $800.

I know that may seem like a lot to spend on an apartment but I live here--it matters.  i sometimes feel like home improvement is all about people who own the place they live it and that is great.  It probably makes the *most* sense to improve things you actually own.

1360041889.0,17x1v1,Can my parent's home be helped?,Harry_Bailey,10,1,6,"I'm 23

The house I grew up in is the house my mom and now step dad live in (no mortgage). I would like to do what I can to improve their living standards. The house is in a state of disarray which is partly because I've got 18ish years of items in the house


Essentially before I move to Colorado, don't have a problem with keeping things clean that are clean. But I'm shamed to say that when I moved out of the house I wasn't concerned with how clean or tidy things were. 

Things haven't gotten to the point where the house would end up on hoards

I've recently learned that the foundation of our house is called pier and beam. I've done some research and learned the differences between that and a slab foundation. Our house being in the North Texas area makes sense that we have a pier and beam foundation. The way has always been supported (since I was young and can remember) was by old tree stumps and cinder blocks. That recently changed since any houses in our city/area that don't look ascetically pleasing have to be brought up to a certain standard. While those changes were being done the pier and beam supports were improved and look much better (I'll post more and take several pictures if anyone things things can be done to get matters improved).

I would like to do what I can to get this house improved the best I can before I go to Colorado (not much time there). However I also plan try and get some money put aside so my parents can afford to make repairs on the house. My mom's in debt up to her eyeballs for medical issues from when I was younger

The biggest renovation I can recall is our front porch. We've never been able to walk on our porch without fear of falling because the wood just wasn't structurally sound enough. In getting the house fixed up by order of the city the porch was also redone. There's all new wood; I was amazed the first time I saw it since I've never been comfortable walking on my porch without fear of shattering a piece of wood like a rickety rope bridge. Our visitors

I can't post a lot right now since my medication is making me extremely tired even as I type this. (Librium for acute anxiety). Taking this Librium actually seems to be what has spurred me to get myself in gear and try to do something about this shamble of a house that I grew up in to improve my parent's quality of life. 

I will say that my best friend's father is a journeyman electrification whom has very graciously agreed to take a look at the electrical wiring and give us an idea of what is/isn't working and what should/needs to be fixed and with what expedience the items should be fixed in.

I will check back on this post in the morning if anyone has made it this far down in what I'm sure is a terribly grammar ridden wall of rambling text, in several places.

My well storage tank will out of the blue keep pumping water into it till it overflows.  It did it yesterday morning and I fear it was doing it for some hours as there was quite a bit of water on the ground.  I unplugged the pump

This morning

There is another device in the tank that cuts off the pump when the tank is full. But is it basing this off of how much water is above that pump or is it basing it off of air pressure?  I read somewhere there needs to be 60psi for it be considered full and drop to 40psi if its needs to be refilled.

Pulling the old faucet out and installing the new one wasn't too bad. The key was to make sure that everything turned the right way

Putting the new one is was incredibly easy. Having a pull-out sprayer and the control on top meant that there was only one place for the water to go, it's essentially a giant, 1 3/8"" bolt. (that's standard) There's a nut that goes with it, and this one was just a tiiiiny bit bigger than the old one. That was enough that I had to whip out the Dremel and shave a little bit of the counter support off to get the new nut in.


**Lessons learned:**

Those holes in your sink? They're made on a 4"" on-center spacing, that's the soap dispenser, and it's doing it's own thing. The plates built into the bottom of a kitchen faucet will always cover those holes too.

Test *everything*. Turns out that the shutoff valve hadn't been cranked in years

Get what you need. Get what you *think* you need. Save your receipts. Take back whatever it turns out you didn't need. Much easier than realizing you actually did need something else.

Take your old stuff off to scrap metal places. $12 for the old faucet isn't too bad when it's a five minute trip while running errands.

I've seen the flashing stuff, I would have to rip the 5/4, so that the total width of the aluminum wrapped portion of the window + the 5/4 would be the same as the 5/4 I'll be using on the corner trim. This also means that the trim should probably be white, so the 5/4 portion will blend in with the white of the windows. (Incorporating the wrapped portion as part of the trim). Otherwise it will look bizarre to have a narrow strip of different color around the window.

The windows crowd almost against the soffits. There is only about a 1"" space between the windows and soffits. Should I put 5/4 trim along the top, so I can get the edge of the top clapboard above where the soffit will fall?

[Here's a picture where you can kind of see both of the things I was talking about

On each of the four corners, the 5/4 on the corners and the roof trim (the piece under the drip edge) will all come together.

How about flashing along the bottom edge of the clapboards, which is new to me. How does THAT work?

[Roof detail](http://i.imgur.com/Lq34ELi.jpg)

On the back of the house is a sliding, and slides the wrong way. would that best be done before siding? Or can it be done afterward? If I intend on attaching a deck in the future (one project at a time, please!) should I attach the header NOW, so I can flash above it, or can that wait, as well?

There was no significant wallpaper buildup on the panels we removed, so it wasn't that we caused the scoring removing it.     

There is some parts where the walls are crumbling and would need serious repairs.

1368565902.0,1ec8qa,[Help] Filling a gap between window and wall,lukednukem,11,3,9,"Hi

Either side of them were what I hoped were solid wooden shutters that had just been painted/nailed shut. The first photo in the gallery shows what the one on the right hand side of the window looks like. 

So, however first up I need to sort out two things

a) the gap between the window and the wall on the left hand side. That is an interior, 2 of which are external. What is my best bet for filling this? Should I even try and fill it all or should I just seal it off?

b) What do I use to cover the ugly wall I have uncovered? Is it plaster? The rest of the room is wallpapered.

I am located in the north east US fwiw.

Total price for the year is $1, and lawn insect control.… this seems excessive to me and I think we should try a DIY solution first. 

[This product](http://www.amazon.com/Scotts-0195410-Defense-Insect-1-1-Gallon/dp/B000RUCQVO/ref=pd_sim_lg_10) or [this product](http://www.lowes.com/ProductDisplay?partNumber=283770-24182-700480&amp;langId=-1&amp;storeId=10151&amp;productId=3030360&amp;catalogId=10051&amp;cmRelshp=req&amp;rel=nofollow&amp;cId=PDIO1) seems to be the equivalent of the “inside/outside” treatment offered by the ""inside/perimeter pest control"" company... you can see the crickets/ants etc on the bottle and we could by 33 bottles of the stuff before we were in the red comparatively. I would also get a professional sprayer than I can load up with a few gallons of the stuff and walk around inside and out and spray large swaths at the same time also.

If we can figure out what to spray on the plants/grass for the other insects (the lawn/bush/tree guy described a garlic based mosquito barrier... probably [this](http://www.amazon.com/Mosquito-Barrier-2000-Liquid-Gallon/dp/B0013JMS5M/ref=pd_sim_lg_10)? / or [this insecticide](http://www.amazon.com/Cutter-Backyard-Repellent-Concentrate-HG-95627/dp/B003B3N5Y6) ) , which also will get rid of the gnats we have right now and take care of the mosquitos before they come as well.

If we bought all these products ourselves:

| Product| Price| Applications| Units Req'd| 	Annual Cost |
|-----------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| Ortho Home Defense Max| 	$           10.55|  	4| 	1| 	$               42.20 | 
| Backyard Bug Control Concentrate	| $           16.49|  	4| 	3| 	$             197.88 | 
| Mosquito Bits (20lbs)	| $           85.00|  	16	| 0.23%	| $                 3.12 | 
| 	| 	| 	|  Total	| $             243.20 | 

The total annual cost would be $243 + the initial cost of the sprayer ($80)… this seems like the better option. Are there other better stuff that the professionals use? Is there a place to buy these chemicals in bulk to further reduce the cost?

What do you guys do in regards to pest control.

I am getting free 2.5 Gallon buckets from a friend

Does this sound reasonable for spacing of footers and depth? I am In Florida btw.

Now the big question is how to connect it all?
I can get 2x4x8, and then the front and back screw into the 2x4. But that will take 70 2x4x8's (need one on each side of the 4x4 except the outer two 4x4s) and be half my budget at $228.9  [4] for all 70 2x4s 

I also thought about a 4 to 2 hurricane tie on top of the 4x4, (48 Ties + 42 2x4s) $259.26


Current expected cost: 210[1]+188.55 [3] +48 [2] + 228.90 [4]=675.45 (screws and sealers haven't been calculated).

The joists look dry and I didn't see any obvious signs of borer.  As far as I'm aware

Any ideas what might have caused cracks like this?  Are they a major problem? I imagine replacing or strengthening flooring joists is not a light or inexpensive undertaking.  Should I forget about buying this house and look elsewhere?  The house is going to auction soon and the way the market is here

I appreciate any advice or information you may have.

About to close on my first home on Friday (fingers crossed) after many many delays...well anyway

*Garage Floor*

- Rust-oleum 2 part epoxy system

*Kitchen*

- The cabinets are builders grade and the boxes are in great shape but the color horrifies me so I plan on painting them: Do I sand them down? Use a liquid sand product? or use Oil based Kills Primer w/ a light coat? Why?

- Paint the interior shelving of the cabinets as well?

- Take the cabinets off the wall to paint and dry or is still on the wall fine?

- Laminate counter tops: Just a sheet or just whole new laminate tops? (did research and the price is almost the same: ~$150 for an 8ft sheet vs $69 for a 6ft top from Ikea)

*Paint*

- Spray the interior (have on available to me) or typical roll on edging method? Is spraying really that much faster even with everything you need to cover/tape?

- Best item to cover carpeting with? Visquene? Blankets? ideas?

- If I were to go with conventional rollers and brushes: which ones are preferred/recommended? and Why?


*Laundry Room*

- Current flooring is linoleum...its horrible and will go: Once its ripped up I was leaning towards using the garage epoxy or concrete paint to do this flooring rather than laying tile. Pros/Cons? (same issue for a storage closet underneath the stairs)

*Demo*

- Will be laying laminate wood floors...in regards to the baseboard trim around the first floor; how to remove them without damaging the walls behind them? (will be buying new baseboards so damaging them is not a concern)


**Thank you** for your help...I'm sure I will come up with more questions before I close but as for right now this is everything I can think of since these will be the big projects I have to tackle first.

**Backstory**

In March(?) a tree fell on her house causing holes in the roof and destroying the old deck. The roof was replaced by a contractor that did a wonderful job

Since some point

-----
**What I know for sure**

* There were holes in the roof directly above (but two stories up) the basement bathroom. No water damage on any of the floors above it though
* No holes in the exterior of the house above the deck that I noticed. 
* The people that built the deck were pretty clearly not professional, etc. They received their payment from the insurance company.
* Water coming into the house was ***definitely not*** an issue before the tree fell.
* Water is still coming into the house when it rains.

-----------------
**Pictures:**
http://imgur.com/a/I5fst

--------------------- 
**Questions:**

* What is a reasonable course of action for determining where the water is entering the house?
* Does the interior of the house look like something I could fix myself having never worked with sheetrock before? 

  - I have built outdoor furniture with a friend before

* If so

----
**Legal/other questions:**

* Does the deck look like it was safely/properly constructed
* Is the insurance company responsible for fixing this? Even though it wasn't filed on the report and many months afterwards?
* If not
