1357767199.0,169t76,Why Richard Sherman is awesome,tarantula13,310,39,53,"My brother Richard Sherman seems to be getting a lot of hate in /r/nfl and other team subreddits but hopefully this post will help others understand why he is awesome and not classless or scum like others will lead you to believe. Let's first air out the dirty laundry and start with why a lot of people hate him. He talks trash

&gt; So what is left for Sherman to do? He really has 2 options. He can either keep doing what he's doing quietly, this is what Sherman wants. This is his goal. He wants to pick off that pass and his talking and running his mouth is what he does to get under the opponent's skin. They shrug it off for a while, but before long there's an itch. NFL players and coaches are the ultimate egos and they'll be damned if they'll let some young punk skinny bitch run his mouth and beg ME, the ALMIGHTY (whoever) to throw the ball on him! WTF does he think he is?! By the time it get's this far, Sherman has already won.

An example of this is when he has been goading Steve Smith all game and it eventually leads to things like this [gif](http://cdn0.sbnation.com/imported_assets/1243603/19603_ShermanISOSlow.gif). Smith rather get physical with Sherman than catch the damn ball on his timing route. People hear the headlines of the ""U MAD BRO"" and such and they jump to conclusions instead of looking into the player as a whole. That constant ribbing on Tom Brady eventually led him to make a poor decision by purposefully throwing at Sherman and he got an interception. That was his goal and he accomplished it. Tom's a smart player and Sherman got under his skin. It's the trash talking before the game

The second reason why I love Richard Sherman so much is that he is an amazing shutdown cornerback. He plays a ton of man to man and does bump and run to disrupt timing routes. I'm sure you many of you already know how spectacular Richard Sherman is at playing the position of cornerback, and has one of the lowest passer ratings against him. Pro Football Focus, an advanced statistics site, has him listed as their [best corner in the NFC](https://www.profootballfocus.com/blog/2012/12/19/pro-bowl-roster-2012-nfc/2/) and had this to say:

&gt; In his second season Richard Sherman has cut down the penalty count and is making a strong case for being the best man coverage cornerback in the league in the absence of Darrelle Revis.

He completely shuts down #1 receivers and eliminates their impact from the game when he is guarding them. Since the NFL is turning more and more passing heavy

What he has started to doing lately though is one of the most impressive things a cornerback can do, [video here](http://www.seahawks.com/videos-photos/videos/Highlight-Richard-Sherman-picks-off-Sanchez/01393cb3-da94-47ae-a5d0-6b581836be72). Sherman purposefully leaves a little room to make receivers look open, then he jumps the route. He is forcing mistakes and changing games. Another example is when he baited Kaepernick in the endzone twice. He dropped the pick the first time, but it worked the second time, [video here](http://www.seahawks.com/videos-photos/videos/Highlight-Sherman-picks-off-Kaepernick-in-the-end/00a3273c-31f0-49a9-ad5b-6f60ceb5bc34). This is just one highlight in one hell of a game Sherman had that night.

The last video I want to leave you with is [Sherman picking off Bradford to end the game](http://www.seahawks.com/videos-photos/videos/Bradford-picked-off-by-Sherman-to-end-game/fbbbb1d4-0154-4f74-9ab6-325aa72176a6). To prefix this, if Bradford throws it to this receiver I will undercut the route."" All he needed there was that split second of confirmation from Bradford and he made a complete shift and sprinted to intercept that ball to make it look like he came out of nowhere. This is high level thinking, this is what a mentally prepared person does, and this specific play has me in awe every time I watch it which leads me into my last point.

I absolutely love Richard Sherman's mindset. He is always playing with a chip on his shoulder and I know that term is overused in the NFL but it's true. This isn't Aaron Rodgers being picked 24th in the first round. This is a guy who got drafted 154th overall in the fifth round which means almost every team skipped over him at least 4 times. He was the 34th defensive back taken in that draft. This means that the NFL collectively thought that there were 33 other guys better than him at defending receivers and now he is arguably the best in the league, yet he is already one of the best. I can't wait to see how he will truly separate from the rest and ascend into greatness in the coming years. I want to end this with an [absolutely terrific article](http://sports.yahoo.com/news/nfl--seahawks--richard-sherman-wants-to--destroy--the-nfl-and-become-the-best-cb-all-time-170800233.html) which goes much deeper into Richard's personality and mindset. I highly recommend that you all read it.

Most of the people that love football play or played football for amateur teams. Like do I.
That's me: http://imgur.com/CS4bJD6
You can see Seattle Sounders jersey under my shoulder pads :)
Most of the guys in my team are Green Bay fans (even our coach). I don't really know anyone who's Seahawks fan except my dad. I did know that someone like Seahawks on my previous job but these guys worked on another project.
I don't really know what to say about me :) It's sad being a lonely Seahawks fan here in Russia :(
You can ask me everything in this thread. I can tell you about amateur football leagues here in Russia if you're interested.

I've been a Seahawks fan since I was about 3 years old. My dad moved to Seattle after he and my mom split and I used to watch the games whenever the Seahawks were on TV because my dad went to a lot of them and I thought I'd see my dad on TV.

Eventually I just fell in love with the Hawks. And trust me some of those years being a Hawks fan weren't easy. Especially being a girl

I got really hellaciously sick this year. Like we thought I had cancer or Hep or any number of things

Believe me

Here's an infographic comparing Wilson to 3 other rookies this year.

http://www.nfl.com/stats/statslab/details?statsType=player&amp;playerId=LUC524055#seasonId=2012&amp;seasonType=REG&amp;position=QB&amp;player1=LUC524055&amp;player2=WIL777781&amp;player3=TAN298716&amp;player4=WEE221487

Luck has more yards (as he would, a better completion percentage, and a better TD to interception ratio.  In fact, he's the only one of those 4 who have more TDs than picks.  To be fair, if you incorporate Luck's rushing TDs, he's got more touchdowns than turnovers, but Wilson's ratio is still superior.

**edit:** I revise my above statement about Luck.  I didn't realize he's had 8 fumbles.  Wilson is the ONLY one of those 4 with a TD:INT ratio &gt; one.

One mantra in /r/redskins recently has been, and polished version of what you've seen in year one, he's going to prove to be a Hell of a pick.  Good luck in the playoff hunt this year.

There is something that

But let me start by saying I used to absolutely hate the seahawks. I have always been upset at them for besting us 9/10 times. I have so many bad memories stemming from your franchise. The absolute breaking point was just 3 years ago, our receivers dropped open passes, and Marshawn ran all over us. I was devestated, and vowed the second the game was over to never watch another game that Seattle would be playing in.

Then, and watched the game against NO. I was excited to see the ""worst team to make the playoffs"" get demolished by the defending world champions. Then, Marshawn motherfuckin Lynch happened. I couldn't help but root for this guy after running possibly the best run I had ever witnessed, and he earned my utmost respect.

Then, you guys were the playing competitive (albeit 7-9) football. With the Lynch run forever in my mind, I watched a few games (despite still hating Seattle) just to watch him run. And I was upset with myself (selfishly). 

Quick backstory, and he should be in the HOF.

But I digress, I could sense something really special in your gigantic corners, and the safeties were great. Watching the defense was a great source of pleasure for me, and I stopped at that moment (though I would never admit it out loud) hating Seattle.

Then this year came. I live in AZ (the Cards are my second favorite team), you guys signed the second most coveted free agent in the league! I was no idiot, and knew you were just a solid QB and maybe one more receiver away from being contenders. I was upset that the seahawks always managed to screw my team (and second team) out of something good. 

Then you drafted Russel Wilson, Wilson excelled in the preseason. The cynic in me said, ""I bet they are gonna go ahead and give Flynn the starting job, because they have so much invested already"" and was ready again to hate them for being stupid because of money. But, Carrol did the respectable thing, and started the player who looked better on film, not the one who was more expensive.

He should have won the game against AZ, the replacement refs) delivered. I was glad to see GB lose.

Then along came week 6. My by far least favorite team in the NFL is the Patriots (I hate Tom Brady more than any other human currently occupying the world, and yet again I was irritated by you guys. Can't you beat the only team I have ever hated more than you? 

Then there it was. Russel Wilson was clutch. Sherman talked shit

And here is the confession that I never could have in my wildest nightmares considered possible:

I am a huge fan of the seahawks. I think Wilson should be rookie of the year, and don't hang your heads after losing to the number 1 seed in the playoffs. The future looks very good for you guys

This is probably because we have been on an amazing winning streak and dominating other teams in the process. During this time

Like /u/nightshiftb said ""Let's at least try not to antagonize or berate - and back up statements with facts and stats.""

Act like we have been here before. Hell. We have been here before. 

We should also be on the look out for troll accounts too. I found the account /u/IspeakForSeahawkFans say ""ALFRED MORRIS IS A BUM! HE DESERVED TO GET STEPPED ON BRO"". This was an obvious troll account. I reported and messaged the mods to help clear our name.

***** 

  I’m a diehard Packers fan from birth and nothing any other team does will change that. I grew up watching Brett Favre play and when he left I started cheering for Aaron Rodgers and I’ve never looked back. That said
This backstory is what made our meeting this past season so gut wrenching for me. Living in Wisconsin, my boss - all Packer fans. I was at first livid with the refs after the game, as I hope you can understand. After a day or two I got over it and I then began defending you guys. You were my backup team and I wished it had happened to anyone else but the two of us. As time passed the Pack fans got over it as well and we accepted our loss peacefully. I was happy to be done with it and looked forward to the rest of the season. Then something terrible happened which changed my outlook on a team I’d cheered for since I was a kid.  

*You guys kept winning.*  

  Against a lot of expectations Seattle kept putting together wins and when they did lose they played great. People began to take notice and like many teams that suddenly started getting wins your fan base exploded. Now I’m not blaming any of you for that, especially considering how close our game was, it really started to get to me.  

  New Seattle fans were the cockiest fans I’d come across and it drove me crazy. I know

  By the playoffs I was sick of hearing it. I was sick of your bandwagon fans and I was sick of them talking like they were the greatest fans to ever watch the game. I was bitter and I started rooting against the team I’d always secretly liked. My initial hope was for us to meet again in the NFC Championship Game and dominate in our “rematch”.  

  When we were eliminated by the 49ers on Saturday I was crushed. On Sunday I didn’t even want to think about football but I found myself tuning in to your match against Atlanta at around halftime and I was surprised at how happy I was to see you guys losing by 20. I had other things to do so I left the room happy and went about my business but when I came back at the very end I saw you were about to score another touchdown and win it. I was captured by the tension and I was jumping around the room cheering against you for that crazy last minute of play. When Atlanta, a pain we now shared.  
  
  I forgot all about football for several hours but when I did remember I came over here to revive myself with your crushed Super Bowl dreams. Instead I found a subreddit full of people slightly bummed about the game but excited about their team! You all were thankful for the awesome season and everyone was looking ahead to next year. I literally felt like the Grinch wondering why you weren’t all crying over your stolen presents. Why were you all singing songs of joy when you should have been crushed your season was ended?  

  That’s when I realized I was the one being a dick. I had no right to judge all you proper fans based on some snide comments from a few jerks. I had no reason to turn on my backup team of 10+ years just because some of the fans were excited about their team. Most of those comments

  You guys had a great season and I think next year will be even better. You have a passionate fan base that’s rightfully proud of their team and that’s nothing to be ashamed of. I’m sorry for having doubted you all and I’ll always root for the Seahawks as long as they’re not playing against the Packers!

For those who didn't see the original thread

100% of profits from this sale ($5/shirt) will go to Bryan Stow and his family. Bryan is a San Francisco sports fan who was severely beaten in 2011, and is still on 24/7 medical care. You can read his story [here](http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2013/06/25/bryan-stow-uncertain-future-giants-fan/2458329/). The money will be donated to Support4BryanStow.com. I wanted this shirt to promote good sportsmanship and a healthy rivalry, and this seemed like the best way to accomplish that.

The shirt will be sold until August 13th, so feel free to order a bunch of shirts with family, friends, and other Hawks fans - shipping is only an extra 25 cents per additional shirt, so group orders are recommended...maybe pass a sign-up sheet around the office, put a post on Facebook to get a group order together, or buy some kick-ass Christmas gifts at just $15.10 apiece.

If you want to spread the word to other fans via Facebook

[Link to order the shirt](http://www.teespring.com/gohawks)

Thanks for the support, the absolute least they will receive is $500.  Oh, and go Hawks!

Russell Wilson looked like an in his prime Drew Brees (who can also run) yesterday. I think he can play like that consistently

Robert Turbin has arrived as a solid backup to Lynch. If the worst happens to our franchise running back

Zach Miller is playing as well as any TE this side of Gronk. He can run block and run routes at a high level.

Wilson has brought out Golden Tate's potential. He has a rhythm with Rice. He can win with our current receiving corps.

Our offensive line is now playing at a high level

Richard Sherman is the real deal. Locks down like Revis

Earl Thomas continues to get even better

Bobby Wagner is manning the middle LB spot at a high level

Our D-Line needs help, and Mebane is a very good nose tackle.

DT: At first I was kind of disgruntled that we were getting run on early but that changed quikcly Jaye Howard is a beast. He's improved so much and I'm sure he loves being back with Quinn from his Florida days. He penetrated the backfield for some tackles well. Bennett and Hill are a great tandem on the inside for pass rushing. The latter made some really nice moves. He'll definitely be the nose tackle in nickel. McDonald didn't look that great. Not bad

Leo/SLB: Morgan really put good pressure. Schofield was also good during nickel. He got a few touches on rivers earlier

LB: Allen Bradford could start for half of the teams. Loutleilei proved he should make the team as well. They are excellent compliments to B-Wagz and KJ. Smith seemed solid from the SLB spot. He covers fairly good as well against TEs which is huge for that spot. 

Secondary Depth: Holy shit. Next.

Oh and Maragos sure is sure handed

OLine: I admittedly didn't notice much other than Rishaw seems like he needs some work. Jeanpierre is a good center but made a few mental errors. Alvin Bailey is a starter quality tackle. Jared Smith and Person were OK as well. Moffitt and Sweezy were solid. The depth at RT is not. 

QB: Russell looked so poised and above the entire Charger defense. 

TJack looks like a great back up. And I'm stoked that he's on the team. You can tell he made a lot of friends here with how the sideline congratulated him. 

WR: Stephen Williams might make the team by proving that he's long ball threat. I didn't see much from Walters or Swain. Kearse is the real deal. He's got the number 4 spot locked up. Ashford and another guy whose name escapes caught the ball. Neat. 

KR/PR: We've got a lot of options. Thurmond III

TEs: Willson is a total steal. He can *really* stretch LBs. If Wilson ever catches the defense in man

RB: Coleman was an OK lead blocker but a great pass protector. Also a good receiving threat like Mike Rob. Michael is the shit and half. He made really good cuts and then exploded and shrugged off loose arms trying to tackle him. He's a one cut and book it type of back. He's no beast mode

I think that's it. I'm stoked. That was awesome. What did yall see?

1357691305.0,167t1z,Seahawks vs Falcons Predictions and Analysis,goodguyatheart,79,18,76,"Last week I made my 10 (which turned out to be 20) keys to the Seahawks winning. I also made an on-record prediction of 28-14



I've been looking at the matchups



Optimistically

Realistically (my actual pick)

Pessimistically



Thought process behind those predictions:


Atlanta has the 6th rated pass offense. They have 3 players with over 70 receptions and almost 1, about Roddy White, Julio Jones, and Tony Gonzalez. Now while the corners Browner and Sherman are fantastic, they have tough tasks. I see one of those two outside receivers having a game, ~80-90 yards and a TD. The X-Factor will be Gonzalez. We really have nobody to match up well against him. None of our linebackers, however good they are, he might even have 2 TDs Sunday. At least one for sure I say. Their run offense is terrible and will be as usual. But if their pass offense is on and Matt Ryan is cold blooded, things are surely worse. Bruce Irvin is not as good. He does have incredible speed that brought him 8 sacks this season including a 9th on Sunday, Ryan is forced to wait and we get coverage sacks

Now let's look at the Seahawks offense where things are more rosey. The Falcons are 23rd against the pass and 21st against the run, look what they've done against zone-read teams like the Seahawks. In 2 games against Carolina, the Falcons eeked out a 30-28 win with a game-winning field goal in the final seconds and lost 30-20 in the second meeting. Cam Newton and the Panther running backs accumulated for 199 rushing yards in the first game and 195 in the second. Newton alone got 86 yards in the first and 116 in the second, scoring a touchdown in each game. Bottom line, Atlanta is not good against mobile quarterbacks using the zone-read like Seattle does. This means Russell Wilson and Marshawn Lynch should have a huge day on the ground using that read. While Atlanta's defense, talent wise, is better than the Redskins...and is faster too...the Seahawks run offense making a difference will open up the pass as well where Russell Wilson is making no mistakes. In his last 9 games, let me place this juicy sir-loin in front of you. In their last 4 games the Falcons are 2-2, our rushing attack should succeed and open up for a good

Ultimately this game comes down to the defense. If we can cover well in the secondary, GO SEAHAWKS.",,False,self,t5_2ryle,False,,

**And we're tilted!**
**The Crowdtilt is set to end at 8/5/2013 at noon EST. If it needs to be extended
__________________

**Background:**

* The 49er's new stadium
* There are three differently sized bricks available for purchase: 8x8 with 4 lines of text
* Each line can hold up to 15 characters
* Everything will be capitalized
* All inscriptions are vetted first. That means nothing derogatory
* The prices include a replica brick
* The bricks are selling as first-come, but we've got a timer on this.


**Ground Rules**


*heavily stolen from /u/Honestly_ 's awesome post as linked to above*

Before I get into anything about sending money

* Any message we pick needs to be approved by the Stadium

* There won't be room to put usernames on the brick

* People who donate will get to have ultimate say on what we write on the brick (suggestions welcome from everyone

* To be fair to those who donate more, theoretically someone could just donate a ton of money and determine what we say--so long as the message isn't something that will clearly be rejected and only credits /r/Seahawks. **For people who do not have Reddit accounts and don't plan on getting one--be sure to let me know through Crowdtilt so I can get your opinion when we're voting for the insrciption.**

* The gold non-premium bricks are $195, $495, $545. If we go over a particular amount, but fall short of another brick, the extra funds will be donated to the whoever the majority of donors (not donor-votes) want, be it a charity, a player's foundation, we could potentially buy more than one brick. We don't get to choose where these bricks go

* The funds will initially go to CrowdTilt, but if you're uncomfortable with that still, I have no problem with letting /u/SGMD1 take over this fundraising part. I'm also fine open to any other suggestions to prove this transparency.

* CrowdTilt allows for a maximum donation period of 30 days


**Payment Selection**


* CrowdTilt requires a minimum target donation, we can donate multiple bricks. Again, Crowdtilt will only charge your credit card if we pass the minimum donation amount, so if we don't raise enough for even the cheapest brick, no worries, you didn't lose any money.


**How to Donate (Two-Step Process)**


If you want to donate to our /r/Seahawks Levi Stadium Brick Fund please use the following two steps:

* Go to our CrowdTilt page and make a donation.

* Since CrowdTilt will only show me your real names, depending on what I'm allowed to edit)(you can message me via reddit or via CrowdTilt; you will get confirmation from me via Reddit message) I will update this post with just the reddit usernames of those who've successfully donated, along with the amount they donated. I will respect requests for anonymity, and only list those dollar amounts to 'anonymous' (or, as someone requested: 'anonymous' + flair).

I'll do my best to keep the list of donors and amounts updated at least once a day, or you have other concerns, please contact me via reddit message and I will do my best to keep you in the loop.

I'm happy to answer questions in this thread or via message.

* 1 of 2 ""experts"" to pick us against the Patriots.
* 1 of 3 to pick us against the Packers.
