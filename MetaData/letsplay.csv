**That's it.**

I'm saying this because it seems that everybody has their own specific rulebook defining what makes a good LP/channel. 

&gt; You shouldn't do Blind LPs because I can't bear to watch somebody struggle for seven seconds. 

Blind LPs can be either tedious or hilarious. The same goes for *every LP ever*.

(Some light analysis + stats),ItsOppositeDayHere,110,17,35,"For the past year or so I've been of the opinion that asking for Likes in any form is sort of pathetic. I don't know why but it's always rubbed me the wrong way (especially when people do it in their actual commentary) so I've completely abstained from the process for the better part of my channel's lifespan. 

That being said, to ""Like"" my Hitman Absolution video so I could show impressive stats to AAA publishers in the hopes of receiving more review copies. The results were [pretty extraordinary!](http://i.imgur.com/xRwsK.png). This is from merely posting a small line in the video description (after the actual description of the video) and encouraging the practice on Facebook and Twitter. For reference, normally my videos hover around 300 likes at the low end and maybe 1,000+ for a few extraordinary ones.  

Encouraged by this, so I think it's as tasteful as it can possibly be. That was about a week ago, and again, this slight reminder has had some very [dramatic results](http://imgur.com/v7eSr) so far. 

As you can see,000. I'm too lazy to do any kind of statistical analysis but it certainly seems like a significant increase. 

**Other Possible Explanations**  

There's two other things that could possibly explain this increase. The first is that maybe my videos have just been better lately so more people are liking them naturally. I can't really confirm or deny this, the same proportion/percentage of viewers are still hitting Like. This could be true as well (again, too lazy to run any kind of analysis) but my views do not appear to have increased the roughly 25% in the past week that they would have needed to in order for this to fully explain the result.  

**So what?**  

""Northernlion

Valid question

(1) More likes may improve search ranking

Through some strange stroke of luck, and those + ""gameplay"", ""review"", etc). This may be due to superior tagging, but it seems like Likes may have played a part in this as well, as the first video in my SU series has an uncharacteristically high number of Likes compared to my usual number (it's around 2,600 I think).   

Obviously

and also

(2) Some people still have YouTube's homepage set to display ""All Activity"" rather than ""Uploads Only"". As such, totally dataless.

* Sony Vegas is easy

* H.264 (mp4)  with optimized settings for youtube (youtube search it) is the best balance between file size and quality

* Fraps is easy but greedy, Dxtory and others are widely preferred, but a pain in the ass and unstable (disagreement among this opinion)

* Check your settings and do a test recording before a long session

* Recording game sound and mic sound in the same track doesn't allow for tweaking in post. You're stuck with the sound levels you get.

http://imgur.com/70a0m  

Note: this is just based on my experience.

The category on the bottom is the most important when it comes to growing your audience and they get less important as you go up. Please note that this does not mean your channel won't grow if you have amazing marketing but awful A/V quality. For example, being realistic, this is the way I think most channels should prioritize their efforts when trying to grow an audience.  

These categories are vague so let's discuss them a little bit. 

**A/V Quality**  

Simply put, crisp picture, and proper resolution (both for the console/game's output and for publishing on YouTube). It is **not mandatory** to have HD quality video but as more and more people start LPing it is becoming increasingly important.  

Audio quality is probably equally as important. Your voice should be clear

It's not likely that many people will follow you *because* your A/V quality is great

**Game Choice**  

Assuming your A/V setup is good, giving you a much wider potential audience, and (2)   newer games have less videos so you have less competition for those searches.  

It sounds cynical but oftentimes popularity is determined by who can be the first to LP a game and thus get the lion's share of the searches. This is one big reason why most huge gaming related channels (there are exceptions -- thinking more about TotalBiscuit types

The worst consequence of this is Let's Play channels where the guy makes a ""walkthrough"" of every new game and just stops it after 10 videos when the next big game comes out. I'm not going to name names but I'm sure you can think of some.  

I'm not telling you to sell out and follow these examples. Your videos will be much better if you choose games you're passionate and knowledgeable about (usually). However

**Personality**  

This is kind of the 'intangible' section. Simply put, confident in your speech, and not leaving too much dead air. If your commentary sucks it will turn people off but everybody has their own style and it gets much better the more you practice. Even if your game choices are obscure, you can become more popular if people love your style.  

**Metadata**  

Easily the most overlooked facet of most channels. Your title should be  neat

I think it's cheesy when channels put ""Like/fav/comment/subscribe"" in their descriptions (worse when it's stated during the commentary) but it must work because pretty much every big channel does it.  

You should tag your videos extensively and search phrases should be in quotation marks. For example, ""mario"", and ""world"".  

Proper metadata will help you rank higher in searches

**Marketing**  

This *can be* an extremely important area but most people go about it all wrong. If you are a small channel

Similarly

The most efficient way to market your channel is through **collaborations**. Co-commentaries (posted to the larger channel with an annotation linking to the co-commentator's channel) have the potential to bring in a lot of new people but it depends on the quality of the video, but most people are going to have to think smaller than that and work at it constantly.  

**tl;dr** Look at the picture. If your A/V sucks

**Why is tagging so important?**  

Proper tagging improves your search rankings which

Also, a co-commentary with a friend who has 500 subscribers might bring you 50 new fans the day it's posted, but by optimizing your tagging you might be able to bring in 5 new fans a day for every single day of your channel's lifespan due to improved search rankings, which adds up over time and over the dozens and dozens of videos you make.  

**Examples**  

HiTrueFittLetsPlay posted [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyrXT09ofDI&amp;feature=youtu.be) on the subreddit today. I don't know these guys personally so I apologize if they take offense to this

*Matty&amp;Sam Play: THE HOUSE Ep Sam stop screaming*  

Lots of problems here that I see in a lot of videos posted on this subreddit.  

* **Improper Parsing**: This is the biggest mistake most people make with tagging. If you don't put phrases in quotation marks, ""Stop"", and ""Screaming"" which is totally useless. Phrases should be contained within quotation marks to keep them intact. For example, instead of tagging your video as *super mario world music*, tag it as ""Super Mario World music"". Easy tip that can have a big impact on your visibility.  

* **Irrelevant Tagging**: Not to harp on this, but don't add them at the expense of relevant tags.  

* **Inadequate Tagging**: What I mean by this is that there's simply not enough tags. YouTube gives you something like 500 characters to tag and

**How do I think of more tags?**  

* Go to the YouTube homepage

* Think of common misspellings or re-arrangements of a game's name. In another thread I used Bomberman 64 as an example. I would probably do a lot of tags with ""Bomberman 64"" in them

* Combine the name of the game with terms that people commonly add to the end of searches for video games on YouTube. For example, you should do several tags with ""Super Mario World"" + one or more of the following: ""gameplay"", ""video"", ""review"", ""let's play"", ""lp"", ""music"" (if it's relevant) to create a variety of possible search phrases. Wrap em all in quotation marks and you're good to go.  

I wanted to post a bit more but I've been interrupted and have to leave for a while

I'm not promising that these will get you to the #1 search rank for whatever game you're playing, make a huge difference ESPECIALLY when your channel is small/just starting out.

**EDIT**: Okay, there are a lot of other factors that go into determining search rankings which usually give larger channels a huge advantage when it comes to ranking highly for specific search terms. Obviously I'm not privy to YouTube or Google's exact search algorithm, but they've mentioned that # of likes, comments, and views, as well as the ratio of views to likes and comments are both taken into account. So, smaller channels are often at a disadvantage because they don't have the sheer volume of viewers to compete for these statistics.  

That being said, I ranked among the top 4 or 5 results for most searches for Super Meat Boy which gave me the kickstart I needed to start becoming more popular. If I could do it back then, you can do it now! It takes more than just proper tagging, but taking some extra care with your tags is a way that you can dramatically improve your visibility with only a few extra minutes of effort per video.",,False,self,True,t3_tlfm9

Recording your voice with Fraps, but if you want to make your audio even better, Audacity is great because it allows you to manipulate some things. There are a lot of great tutorials on youtube, and on the audacity website, but for now we'll cover some of the basic stuff to get you started. For a few more advanced tricks please see [**THIS Post**](http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/1bn7dd/posted_tutorial_audio_quality/)



_______________________________________________________________________________


**Your Settings** - This can be down to personal preference

First

Next

Finally, with game audio recorded in stereo.

Here's why you should use mono

&gt;Stereo has two channels for each track of audio. If all you're recording is speech or a video game

&gt;This makes audio encoding and editing more or less twice as work intensive for programs in addition to resulting in a larger file size. For the vast majority of recordings and people who make YouTube videos

So you've downloaded Audacity...now what? Well

Okay, it's quite simple to use! Right now you should be looking at something [similar to this](http://i.imgur.com/UvBVQ8a.jpg).

Great, and some other crap, so what? Well, let's cover some of the ""crap"" you're looking at. So, going from left to right we have...
_________________________________________________________________________________

**Control Bar** - **[This fancy little guy](http://i.imgur.com/JsrxSbh.jpg)** is your control bar. This is how you will record your audio, but this is the basics, after all! 

________________________________________________________________________________


**Tools** This is possibly one of the more important things you need to know. **[These](http://i.imgur.com/ShXXJW0.jpg)** will allow you to (From left to right, draw, zoom,  and shift time.

 **Select -** This allows you to select specific parts **[like so](http://i.imgur.com/UtiVBtI.jpg)**

**Envelope** - This lets you shift the volume of the audio over time based on control points that you place on the track. Useful for fad-ins and fade-outs

**Draw Tool** - **[Allows you to ""draw""](http://i.imgur.com/ixBmjZ0.jpg)** in the samples

**Zoom** - It zooms. Yeah.

**Shift Time** - This allows you to become Doctor Who. Kidding aside, and many other reasons. **[Example](http://i.imgur.com/kMO5P5f.jpg)**


_______________________________________________________________________________

So we've covered the tools

The monitor on the left is for your output levels. These will light up when you press play on your recorded audio and let you keep an eye on how loud or quiet your audio is.  The monitor on the right lets you see how loud or quiet your input - or microphone audio is. If you left click on your input monitor, etc. even before hitting record. **You should, however, always do test recordings before you start recording a LP!**

Next in Line? Ah yes, which you should all be familiar with:

**Cut** This is just like when you cut some text out of notepad and paste it somewhere else

**Copy** Same deal as before, with the ability to place it anywhere in the same sample, or a different.

**Paste** Well


Next we get a little more different...

**Trim** This will remove any audio around a selected segment

**Silence** This will mute any sound you have **[selected.](http://i.imgur.com/WcNs0mT.jpg)**

Next!

**Undo** Well

**Redo** We all love second tries. This is Undo's ""hero"" brother. That time you accidentally undid something

**Sync Locked Tracks** I'll be honest, so coming right from the Audacity page: 

&gt;""Any audio track in Audacity can be in a group of one or more adjacent tracks that can be Sync-Locked with other tracks in that group. Sync-Lock is off by default

&gt;When Sync-Lock is on an icon () shows bottom right in the Track Control Panel of each track in a Sync-Locked group provided at least one of those tracks is selected. The icon denotes all tracks that will be affected when a menu operation in a selected track inserts or deletes audio (or otherwise changes the audio's position on the Timeline). The unselected tracks that will be affected are denoted by a patterned ""Sync-Lock"" selection in the waveform instead of the dark gray of a normally selected track.

&gt;Label Tracks can be included in a group so that their labels are synchronised with the audio. If present a Label Track also delimits a track group so that the audio track(s) underneath are in separate group(s). Tracks in those groups will not be affected by actions in the group above unless at least one track in those separate groups is selected. If a group includes more than one label track

Best of luck with that...

The rest in that row are just other ways of zooming in and out.
_______________________________________________________________________________


Whew! That was a lot! We're almost done!

The last bar you see is one damn important bar. From these drop down menu's, your output (Where your audio plays to), and your input (your microphone / recording device), and your input channels (Stereo, mono). **For recording voice, you should use MONO!**

**[Sexy MS Paint Skillz](http://i.imgur.com/CSWk9lq.jpg)**

_______________________________________________________________________________


Last, many covered in the guide posted at the top) But the ones you should get familiar with are: **Amplify, Bass and Treble, Click Removal, Equalization, Fade In/Out, Noise Removal, but those will be the most helpful

Welp, and I hope this helped those of you who want to try Audacity!

Happy LPing!

I've been doing Let's Plays every single day for the past 8 months and have enjoyed it immensely. I have also been fortunate enough to gain a great deal of subscribers in a very short amount of time and even though I actually LOST my first channel I fought back and started again to get to where I am today. A lot of my success is thanks to this very subreddit and the extensive advice of [NorthernLion](http://www.reddit.com/user/ItsOppositeDayHere). Before you take any advice of mine

First off

Above all else you have to enjoy what you're doing. If not you're just going to end up burnt out after a while without seeing proper success. I worked incredibly hard (12 hours a day) trying to get attention for my channel. I enjoyed it so much that I sprang out of bed in the morning and lost sleep at night. There are a thousand little tips I could give you but [NorthernLion](http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/p2o8z/why_doesnt_anyone_watch_my_videos_a_helpful_guide/) covers all of that and more better than I ever could.

So best piece of advice that I could give you is to exhaustively connect with your audience. If you have a single person that truly enjoys your videos and messages you

Also, the ""Slender"" phenomenon (if you do horror), gangnam style, pretty much anything that has people talking and has something that people are searching for. 

The hardest truth to understand is that even if your content is the best in the world

Another important piece of information to understand is that gaining popularity is not a competition. Doing collabs with channels similar subscriber level will do much more for getting exposure than anything else you could do for both of your channels. 

I could write a novel rambling about various tips and things that I think you should do to gain popularity but you'll figure it all out as you go. You get out of it what you put into it and that includes being a part of communities like this. 

Get out there and enjoy what you do because if you don't believe in yourself

1375781191.0,1jsvqd,The SEO Thread,SplatterCatGames,47,6,72,"Alright guys, people who have made successful careers off of their expertise and so

**What is SEO?**

SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization, let's get under the hood together and talk about how it works on Youtube.

**So first things first

 I know that this whole article is supposed to be on SEO but if your video doesn't hook people it won't matter how many watch because they won't stick around. I know guys who have videos with hundreds of thousands of views and yet, make sure your video has all the aspects that people have come to expect from Youtube media. Calls to action, humor, and proper vocal inflection can all help people feel engaged to the content you're trying to sell. READ YOUR YOUTUBE PLAYBOOK. [Here's the link, do it nao!](http://www.youtube.com/yt/playbook/) Once you feel like you can get people hooked, let's get to the good stuff : SEO!

**How Youtube Search Indexing works**

I'm going to come clean right here and say I don't know. Period. Now that I'm all done being honest, Yale and other major Universities. From what most experts can tell there are a number of tests that a video is subjected to before it's given a slot to occupy in the search results. Additionally, it can Youtube weeks to finally settle a video. Just because you land on page 5 the first day, doesn't mean you'll stay there. Don't lose hope, hang in there. Every few days they rotate the videos around based on the following statistics : (This isn't a comprehensive list, no one has that aside from Youtube. These aren't in any particular order either.)

* View Count

* Title

* Keywords in the Description

* Tags

* Total interaction (Likes + Dislikes + ?Comments?)

* Like/Dislike Ratio (Likes vs Dislikes)

* Raw File Name

While some of these are self explanatory

**File Name**

A lot of people don't know this, it's already more than likely too late. Now that you're privy to the information, though, you can start naming your files more accurately. For example, my typical file name for a Project zomboid LP might be ""ZomboidGameplay1.mp4"". 

**Titles**

There are a number of ways to approach titles, I'd say to use your best discretion. If you feel like your title is overly taggy and doesn't sound good, then I'd probably back off of it and do something more natural. If you want to use your titles like a tag section, that's your call and I don't blame you. Personally, I try to go for a reasonable middle ground in this regard. *Edit The playbook says to throw your relevant tag information to the front of your title for maximum effect. Thanks to JonPaula for calling this one out.*

TLDR ; Youtube parses your titles. Tag the hell out of them

**Video Descriptions**

A largely overlooked section in most people's videos (Mine too for a while.) but incredibly important. Youtube searches the living hell out of your descriptions for applicable keywords. This has led to a practice known as ""Tag spamming"" in a lot of larger channels. What ""tag spamming"" entails is completely overloading your description section with search relevant keywords so that you'll get a competitive edge come upload time. It's incredibly effective right now, you should always LINK your channel in the description section with a call to action. (Check out the channel : Channel link) Beyond that, it's up to you what you do in your description section. I personally load mine up hard. The visible part is typically a joke pertaining to the current episode. Below that I'll put my links, and down below that I'll have a brief synopsis of what the game is about for viewers who don't know. I like this as a middle ground as it puts relevant, search worthy tags in your description while still being helpful to the uninformed. 

TLDR; Youtube looks at your descriptions. Make them relevant. 

**Tags**

Fill this section up with every relevant keyword you can. If you're playing Megaman X, ""Gameplay"". Those won't work well and will probably give you HIV. That's how much you want to avoid them. If you aren't filling this entire section until it flashes red, you're cheating yourself. Every tag you put in your video is another search that will yield your page as a result so do your best to fill it out completely. Stumped? Google has a tool for you. It's called [Google Adwords Keyword Tool](https://adwords.google.com/o/Targeting/Explorer?__c=1000000000&amp;__u=1000000000&amp;ideaRequestType=KEYWORD_IDEAS) and you should use it any time you can't think of a way to fill out your tag section. By entering the game name, for example, it will list out 100 different related and commonly hit on (giggity) search results that surround your game title. It will tell you how many hits a month that search gets, and more importantly the competition for those tags. Ideally you want to look for LOW competition tag with millions of hits. Play around with it for a while, and believe me you'll find some gems. Do yourself a huge favor

TLDR; FILL THIS ENTIRE SECTION. SERIOUSLY. 

**Audience Retention ADDED**

I wrote this entire article at 3AM while slightly inebriated so this one slipped my mind. However, and from what I can tell (Based on my personal search rankings.) it seems to be sufficient. 

**General Info**

Those are the main points I wanted to hit. Likes / Dislikes / Comments I can't really help too much with but just try to keep people engaged. If you want to learn to write jokes, speaking from the diaphragm instead of the throat, not saying ""um"" ever, these are all things that lend an extra little bit of cleanliness to your content. I feel like I'm talking too much at this point so I'll cut it off here. Feel free to ask questions, call bullshit, and otherwise scrutinize what I've said. I'll freely admit that Youtube doesn't publish a lot of information about how it's search rankings work, so I encourage everyone to do their own research and not take my word for it. (To quote LeVar Burton.) I believe very strongly that Youtube is a summer pool with room for everyone, Reddit.

##[Physical Etiquette]

___


1. Film early or late at night. (Avoid busy times of day and associated noise)

2. Isolate yourself from doorways and windows. Arrange your monitors to block potential noise entryways. Make a sort of cubical that helps prevent background noise.

3. Stop all sources of noise that are in your control. Turn off fans

4. If you own a desktop mic it is a *very* wise idea for it to not be on the desk you type on. Sound after all, but it will be able to feel them quite literally. Also slip a mouse pad under the microphone's base if you can, that is also a viable way to reduce vibration pickup.

5. Test your headphones or headset and ensure the microphone picks up as little game/speaker sound as possible. Find a volume level that allows you to hear the application

6. You can help reduce echo in your room by purchasing [Acoustic Foam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_foam)

7. Get a [Pop Filter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_filter) for your desktop microphone. You may construct your own wind-sock-like device by stretching a porous cloth (like pantyhose) over a diaphragm to help reduce airflow toward your mic.  

9. Keep at least a one foot distance from your sensitive microphones. That is

10. Buy a laptop-esq keyboard and quiet clicking mouse. You want your key-presses to be be as silent as possible, and flowing like a tophat soaked in a fine brandy.

11. You might want to have a push-to-talk setup for your microphone. This prevents unwelcomed guests

##[Software Etiquette]

________

1. [Editor Literacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_editing): Many featured video editing programs provide a whole host of effects to help limit background noise

2. [Decibel Literacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel): Decibels are the representation of a sound's intensity to the human ear - or that is at least how we refer to it in this specific article. Human speech is around -6db. In your video

3. [Multiple Audio Channel Files](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_Video_Interleave): Split your voice audio and your game audio. *You can't utilize any of the below when your voice is mixed with that tar-pit we call game audio.* Recording applications such as [DXTORY](http://dxtory.com/) do this.

4. [Compressors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_range_compression): This filter will ensure your vocal volume stays within a range higher than silent and below ear-bleeding. If you use any of these filters mentioned in this article, you can almost guarantee that viewer won't be coming back - unless they're into that kind of thing. 

5. [Noise Gates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_gate): Noise gates do what you think they do. They remove all sound under a certain threshold. For me personally, find your sweet spot!

6. [Equalizers]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equalization_(audio\) ): Personal Example: [Here](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/102186115/Old/Equalizer.jpg).
Equalization is used to add bass and tremble to your voice. If you've heard [Captain Sparklez](http://www.youtube.com/user/CaptainSparklez) voice as well as other famous YouTubers

7. [Maximizers](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTk_AT_ccnQ): **YouTube link** Maximizers are basically compressors that keep your voice consistent with a decibel range or specific value. Meaning that if your audio isn't riddled with [artifacts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_artifact) you can keep your voice at a consistent volume with little effort.

8. [Pitch Shifters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_shift): Only shift your voice's pitch by a *small* degree. I'm speaking in [cents](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cent_(music\)) of ten to twenty here

9. [Mono Audio](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaural): Mix down or record your voice and game audio in [Mono](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaural). Mono audio has only one sound channel, stereo is a waste of precious file size and aids to nothing.

10. Ensure your game audio never gets louder than your voice. If you are the focus of your channel

##[Practiced Etiquette]

___


1. Avoid shouting into your microphone. It peaks the waveform and makes your voice sound awful. In addition to giving your viewers an earful

2. Don't touch your microphone while recording. The audience doesn't need to hear fumbling and scratching while they are trying to enjoy your quality content.

3. Oil that squeaky chair

4. Every single time you get prepared to start recording, but your $15 webcam's microphone.

5. Always aim for better quality content. Look back at your videos weekly. Ask yourself if your content is better than what you had before. Does your voice sound *exactly* how you want it? If not


##[User-Submitted Etiquette]
_____
#[[DisembodiedDave](http://www.reddit.com/user/disembodieddave)] 

1. If you finding you keyboard and mouse are being picked up

2. Understand Mic position, try aiming your mic differently. 

3. Knowing the [polar pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microphone_pick_up_patterns#Microphone_polar_patterns) of your mic is important here. The most common is the Cardioid

4. Each room is different and they all have a background noise. There a couple of ways you can reduce this before recording. Parallel walls a generally a bad thing for recording audio. Try recording with bookshelf
If all else fails (including post processing),"" cleaner sound is desired. I would only recommend it as a last resort, and you should have the sense to keep your computer tower outside of the fort. 

5. For Push-To-Talk. Invest in a nice gaming mouse that has some extra buttons on it. Like the Razer Naga or Logitech G6000. Then assign one of the extra buttons to your push-to-talk to free up all the fingers you actually use during gaming. 

[[Koonetz]](http://www.reddit.com/user/Koonetz)

1359234469.0,17bzyu,Rethinking my earlier advice on tagging,ItsOppositeDayHere,43,3,24,"So

* Tag exhaustively (fill the box with relevant tags) 
* Put important phrases in quotations 
* Use iterations on the name of the game + descriptors (ie. ""DmC"", ""DmC Let's Play"", etc.)  

After recently doing some research and switching my strategy a bit, tempering my enthusiasm with my old model. This post doesn't necessarily have any definitive advice; it's more food for thought and, as always, discussion is absolutely encouraged (especially if you have evidence to back it up!)  

**Does tagging exhaustively actually *hurt* you?**  

The whole genesis for this thread came from my experiences last week after producing a review and first impressions type video for DmC. I tagged these videos exhaustively using the methods detailed in my earlier post and was disappointed to find that I ranked somewhat poorly. In order to re-evaluate my strategy somewhat to see if the reason for my poor ranking was due to improper tagging

&gt;DMC, DMC Devil May Cry, Gameplay, Walkthrough, Mission, Ending, Review, Let&amp;#39;s Play

(You can see a video's tags by right-clicking the page then ""View Page Source"". Keep in mind that copying another video's tags verbatim is a TOS violation)

As you can see, but anyway) in favor of a few specific tags followed by some general ones.  

Now, likes (AFAIK), the title and description, and so on. So, it's impossible to isolate the tags as the factor that made TRB rank so well since he also has a huge following and the video is well supported. Secondly, some other high ranking YTers (GhostRobo for example) seem to tag more similar to my earlier method while still being reasonably successful.  

Still

**My (Anecdotal) Experience**  

To test this new method

&gt;the cave, the cave gameplay, the cave video, the cave strategy guide, the cave review, the cave double fine, double f..  

While Episode 2 is tagged like so:  

&gt;the cave, ron gilbert, tim schafer, sega, walkthrough, the cave walkthrough, northernlion, gameplay

So, aren't simply iterations on ""The Cave + [descriptor]"".  

Now, perhaps because it usually has the highest views, likes, comments, time watched (etc.) However, here are the results for The Cave so far. 

[Exhibit A](http://i.imgur.com/gtydQqA.png) and [Exhibit B](http://imgur.com/ZkGVmf4)  

As you can see, but it's totally possible that cookies could have affected my search rankings one way or the other.  

However

**Conclusion and tl;dr** 

It's important as always to take this with a grain of salt as it's only one man's opinion and experience, I recommend you experiment on your own to find what works best for you and your videos!

This site took a ton of work and there's more we'd like to add, etc. but with the increased focused and organization of a dedicated site. This site was just 'released', and we're reaching out to anybody who is interested in joining, contributing, or just suggesting stuff. The site is the result of the two us addressing a lot of complaints from LP'ers, as well as trying to streamline the process of adding videos and create a more focused community than the chaos of Youtube.

1367930613.0,1duwnz,"Advice for LP'ers, experienced or not",Bortobob,37,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/1duwnz/advice_for_lpers_experienced_or_not/

**1. Always On** So, or years. You're feeling pretty confident in your abilities. You see someone who's new to the experience, and you want to help! Great! So you begin to pass on your wisdom to this new contender.

""It's a bad idea to have dead air in your commentary. People feel awkward and they'll stop being engrossed if they notice dead air!""

As true as this may be, you're experienced, and they're not. Get down to human, empathetic levels. People aren't dumb, but they're not ""in the circle"". Instead of (or in addition to) ""don't leave dead air in your videos"" try ""talk about what you know and like"".

Not all dead air is the end of your channel and reputation. Granted, in my own experience. There will come a time when you won't have anything, and in your struggle to ""always be on"", you'll end up making nonsense. You'll begin ideas that have no business being discussed. Dead air doesn't mean start talking about your lunch. If you start an idea just because you have to, it wont be a genuine idea. Often, it wont even be an interesting idea. So many new people start off with this advice and talk about nothing. Sure, there's no dead air... but we as viewers don't CARE about what you have to say in this situation... And it makes us leave your video to find something actually interesting to us.

So, or some other outside factor where you actually experience performing for, or in front of people... your commentary will be bad. Even with those past skills, doing LP's is its own beast. Your first commentaries will be bad. Deal with it and move on.

Now that you're not worried (hopefully) about doing your commentary ""right"", don't try to be. Go with what you're good at. If you're a super casual gamer who doesn't like the sound of their own voice, try making a video just playing your game with no commentary. People will watch.

If you're naturally funny, quiet, energetic, sarcastic, satirical, or whatever it may be... great! Variety is the spice of life. Not every LP has to be funny. Not every LP has to make fun of the game on screen. They don't all need commentary, they don't all need to be constantly engaging and hyper-engrossing. If you're having fun

**2. Views and Subs** Hey, and want to thank your fans and community! The short answer to this is keep it brief/don't. Making a big deal over your subs and views places even greater pressure on newcomers to get more subs/views.

If people start LP'ing with the intent of having lots of subs, selling us time wastes, with the expectancy of fame and glory. Not fun for anyone. Not fun for the viewers, and not fun for the creators.

Placing less emphasis on high numbers helps to relieve the pressure of achieving those numbers. If you're excited about your numbers

And complaining about not having views helps no one. The vast majority of content creators don't get many views. Cry us all a river.  We're all in the same boat.

If you worry about views and subs

**3. Just be Yourself** Ok, then say what I'm about to say.

Not everyone knows who they are when it comes to LP'ing. At least not at the start. As I said earlier, vary in style. If you don't know your style, don't fret. No one did at the start. Start experimenting and figure things out as you go. Just because many LP'ers are funny, it doesn't mean you should too. Sure, being funny helps. Laughing puts people in a good mood! But not everything has to incite raucous joviality.

When was the last time the Olympics were funny? Was that amazing play you watched over the weekend funny from start to finish? Did that movie have you falling out of your chair clutching your sides?

Rhetorical questions aside, but not in the hot seat, tailor your videos to feed on your editing. If you have a keen eye for detail in games, build on that skill and show us secrets of the game, glitches, or special things that only someone with experience could pull off. If you're a pro, show us with an intense fight we couldn't hope to survive as easily as you.

If you don't know what your niche is

**4. Technical Difficulties** This section is kind of moot in a weird way.

Remember that not everyone has a top of the line computer, and questions to fix it are just as popular.

For experienced LP'ers, don't go handing out advice on what to buy. Don't tell other people what to spend their money on if you don't know the whole situation. Just because one product worked for you, doesn't mean it'll help everyone. Instead, show people where they CAN get the information. Let them make informed decisions, providing they can find the information.

And as for inexperienced LP'ers, or fourth opinion. Read reviews on everything. Sleep on it. Look again tomorrow. Exhaust your outlets. Get as much information as you can. Information is everywhere. If you're strapped for cash, but intend on spending money for LP'ing, make triple sure you're buying the thing that will work for you. With hundreds of mics of varying types and configurations, there's a lot to consider. Don't make a purchase off one person's advice. Maybe you don't want a Blue Snowball mic. If you've got an echo'y room, or a mechanical keyboard, you will probably want a shotgun mic instead of a diaphragm mic. And if you don't know what those terms mean... educate yourself. Wikipedia it. Make informed decisions.

Just remember that not everyone can or will have studio quality hardware. It's just a fact of life. We don't watch your videos just because they're crisp and clear. We watch for the personality behind the high definition. We also watch the personalities behind low definition. Provided your viewer isn't distracted by your tech

**5. In Conclusion** In conclusion...? Just have fun. If LP'ing isn't fun
If there's too much to focus on, you're in it for the wrong reasons. Stop worrying about it so much. It's playing video games. Just play the game and enjoy yourself.



Now, or anyone else thinks of your videos. Doing it for the approval of others is a selfish and unsubstantiated reason to LP. Of course, LP'ing in an attempt to entertain people is totally fine. So long as you aren't bogged down by all of the stigma surrounding the genre of entertainment.

**TL;DR: Experienced LP'ers; remember to empathize with newbies.
Newbies; just be a person until you develop into an experienced LP'er.**

Thank you for taking the time to read my post!  I thought I would share a little bit about LP'ing and hopefully help at least one person.  A little background on myself

* **Have Fun!** - I made this point above but

* **Audio &amp; Video Quality Matter** - Quality is very important

&gt; Video - How will the world see you play that **awesome** game?  You need to capture your game play obviously!  I recommend using the program [Dxtory](http://dxtory.com/v2-home-en.html), and much more!  If you're recording game play on a console, you'll need a different recording device.

I'll try to make a separate post on this at a later date.

&gt; Audio - **DON'T OVERLOOK AUDIO QUALITY!** Audio is super important and is relatively easy to setup.  You'll need to make sure you have a quality microphone...you don't need a top of the line microphone like a Snowball or Yeti

[Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/) is your friend! Learn to use it

Again

* **Consistency** - Staying consistent is something I WISH someone told me when I started doing LP's!  **STICK TO A SCHEDULE** ... whether it's once a week

If you can...try to post around the same time each day!  It may not help much in the beginning

* **Content of the Video** - On to the meat of your videos...the CONTENT!  I can write so much here...but this section will be a little different for everyone!  Try to make yourself different from other LP'ers!  That'll help you stand out.  **Try not to be repetitive**

* **Video Title/Tags** - Oh the NERDY stuff of the video making process! **KEYWORDS!**  Naming your videos and using the correct keywords will help your video rank higher in Youtube's searching algorhythm.  *While this isn't the only factor in searching for your videos*...it definitely helps!  Here is how I name my videos:
&gt; **Game Name** - **Title of Episode** - **Part ___**
For example
&gt; **Donkey Kong Country** - **Woodchuck!** - **Part 2**
I do this for a variety of reasons
*A LP'ers name, or a tip*
**The more times you mention something, DESCRIPTION, &amp; TAGS, the higher it ranks.**
Normally the Youtube can come up with some GREAT tags for your video.  But, and anything else relevant. 
**This could be a whole post in itself...but don't underestimate the power of the Title and Tags!**

There is more when it comes it making a video and I just scratched the surface.  Things that I didn't cover is the whole **promotion** aspect of your video.  I believe Social Media helps!  It may not prove beneficial right away

I hope this helped a couple of people and hopefully I didn't ramble on too long!  I wish you the best of luck in your Youtube endeavors!  And

* Don't confuse CPM with RPM! ""Cost per thousand"" represents the *total* cost sold on the video, which meant 1,000) is the number YOU receive. It's important to learn the difference, as a Network Contract might offer you a ""$5 CPM"", but again, you'll never see more than ~55% of such a figure. 

* Ignore Google Adsense's numbers/reports. I've been earning a living from YouTube for five years now, and only focus on specific ads. Instead...

* **USE ANALYTICS**: Select a time range (Networks are fond of looking at 6-month averages to gage a channel's general success over time)

* **""Estimated Monetized Playbacks""**, as many of us use multiple advertisements per video (a pre-roll, mid-roll, and post-roll in a 24 minute upload, for example). 

* Take this figure, likely in the $4 - $10 range, (determined by many factors, including number of ads served, type of content, metadata, time of the year, *especially* so if you calculate over a six-month span

* For those (like me, or work the formula in reverse if you're trying to see what a Network's flat-rate of $3.00 would get you, for example. All networks that offer a ""flat-rate"" calculate your revenue based on ""Estimated Monetized Playbacks"" - not views.


**TL;DR**: In YouTube analytics,000 to get your true RPM -- Compare this to a Network's offer, and **negotiate**! -- Good luck, and let me know if you have questions!

[You can get the new layout on your channel here. Don't blame me if you hate it](http://www.youtube.com/onechannel)

**Channel Art** 

Custom backgrounds are gone but you can customize your channel by uploading a custom banner (http://gyazo.com/77d17881859e839682dfa9618aba1dd2.png?1362764599) Recommended size is 2120x1192 and you can add your Twitter/FB/Twitch (etc.) links to the banner automatically from your channel page

**Sections** 

Below your featured video/channel trailer (which I'll talk about later) is an area for *sections* (http://gyazo.com/77f986c6bfff0fe2816042174cd7dd4d) which you will use to organize your videos. In the old layout you had the option to arrange your playlists in whatever order you want, but there's also built-in options for popular uploads, recent uploads, live events (in the unlikely event you stream on YouTube) and many other criteria. You can even create sections based on tags, if you want, which will display all videos with a specific tag. 

Overall

**Channel Trailer**  

One of the new features I was excited for was the ability to make a channel trailer (http://gyazo.com/719c8dff2e1c3007c4617cdee5cb2180) that only shows up to channel visitors who are unsubscribed. This way, but overall it accomplished what I wanted: short(ish), explains what I do and why I think that provides value, and encouraged people to subscribe without begging. It's too early to tell how it's been working but my subscription rate hasn't dropped precipitously or anything (nor has it risen significantly either) so it's likely the layout isn't a total catastrophe overall.  

I'm sure we'll see some really cool stuff with channel trailers as well as some really deplorable stuff

**Overall Tips**  

*Keep in mind I've only had the layout for the day and that's not enough time to gather good data. These are just my hunches

* Upload your channel trailer as ""unlisted"" and in Advanced Settings uncheck 'notify subscribers' if you don't want existing fans to be bothered by your trailer upload.  

* I would recommend fleshing out the ""About"" section on your channel. With the new layout showing the ""About"" tab fairly prominently (http://gyazo.com/be18e3d40873d0bdfd09ad73ff62e271)

&gt; I've been hearing a lot of talk about this, such as CrystalStarStudio's or MasaeAnela's in the past months and it was seriously fun. I intend on doing more things like it too. It seems like so few group efforts or projects centered around simple fun exist now. Stuff's always more fun with friends, so why not work with them on videos or streams? Get together for a weekend over Skype, broadcast on stream, and maybe raise money for charity?

&gt; Wanting to work with friends was how TheRunawayGuys was started, in our tournaments. Cross-promo works, it pays to work together. Can we stop treating making game commentary like a competition? I'm not saying you have to be friends with everyone or even like everyone, but I'm sure you'll find it more enjoyable to make videos when it's about fun and working together, not about getting attention. ""It's the only way to get attention"" isn't a good reason for cutting off from others, nor is it a good core to shape your content around. Heck, if I was hungry for as much attention as possible, and this doesn't have to be a competition

&gt;This community is one of the greatest things I've had in my life. I've made more friends than I can count from it, speak through actions. Positive actions. Reach out to old friends who make videos or want to make videos, you know, the ones you've been meaning to talk to again. Nothing's stopping you. Collaborate. Be constructive. Have fun. Smile, since that never hurts. Is that too much to ask?

1323083644.0,n104x,How to Grow Your Audience on YouTube (tips),ItsOppositeDayHere,35,8,28,"I see a lot of people on /r/LetsPlay lamenting how difficult it is to get their videos noticed on YouTube among the tens of thousands of other LPers out there. It sucks putting a lot of time into your videos and only having a few people watch them

Now, but over the past year or so I've come up with a lot of very simple tips to finding and maintaining an audience that might prove useful to channels just starting out.  

Feel free to add your own tips/ask questions!

**Getting Noticed**

* Make sure your title is in clear

* Tag, you're missing out on a potentially huge audience due to search traffic.  Put search strings in quotation marks, ie. ""Super Meat Boy"" instead of just *super meat boy*. Type the name of your game into the YouTube search bar to see what common searches for that game are, and add relevant ones to your tags (ie. *""super meat boy walkthrough""*, *""super meat boy gameplay""*). Proper tagging improves search ranking. Even if it only brings an extra 10 viewers a day, that adds up over a few months and across dozens of videos.  

**Technical Stuff**  

* If you want to grow your channel beyond a few hundred subscribers, voice, and game audio should all be as clear as possible. Additionally, your voice should be high enough above the game audio that people can easily understand your commentary without straining. This is of utmost importance. Ask for feedback on /r/LP if you're concerned.

**Keeping an Audience** 

* **Keep a consistent upload schedule**. Decide how many videos you're upload every day/week, IMO, the most important tip for making sure your audience continues to watch your videos. Freddiew has a great quote, ""a consistent audience requires consistent content"". That doesn't mean you have to upload 20 videos a week. Even if you're only going to do 3 (or 1), make sure you let your audience know they can rely on you to put those videos up every M/W/F and they'll come back to watch them.  

* All videos in a series should have the same (or very similar) tags to make sure they show up in the related videos sidebar for one another. About 25% of my total views come from people clicking a video on that sidebar; nothing to sneeze at.  

* Interact with your audience. Got a few viewers who comment on every video? Make sure to reply to their comments now and then so they know you appreciate it. If your channel is big enough, etc. Eventually it becomes impossible to do this for everybody, but it feels good and lets your fans (no matter how few) know how much you appreciate them.  

* You can also use social media channels to distribute/promote new videos.  

* Practice good channel maintenance. This means

**Networking**  

* One of the things I've noticed since the Together to the Top movement started is a huge increase in box-for-boxing (putting a channel in your ""Other Channels"" box in exchange for the same from the other person). There's nothing wrong with this but **box-for-boxing is worthless unless you get a lot of channel views**. I get around 5k channel views a day and probably only add a few subscribers every day to the channels in my box. If you're getting &lt;1

* Sub-for-sub is even worse. It does nothing but inflate your subscriber count and it makes you look like a tool when you have 5k subscribers but your videos get 100 views each.  

* The best form of networking for small-medium sized channels is to actually get down and dirty and **do collaborations**. Find someone you like who is around the same size

**Turning Viewers into Subscribers**

Here begins the stuff that might be perceived by some people as slightly game-y

* I put a small annotation with my channel name and an embedded link to subscribe in the top-right/bottom-right corner of every video. Keep it small and out of the way so it doesn't obstruct anything.  

* In my video descriptions

1367534443.0,1dkykr,[Discussion] We need better ways of counteracting video-dumping,QuizzicalPixel,23,0,35,"Let me just start off by saying that I have been a part of this subreddit for quite some time now

That being said, fundamental issue of this community as a whole:

Every day in /r/letsplay, despite there being an average of ~20 to ~45 active users on at any given time, nobody is commenting on or even taking a look at any of the new Let's-Plays (some of which are *exceptionally* well-made) that are being posted here. Take a brief scroll through the new submissions, and more often than not, you'll find a ghost town of 0 comment posts. This, too, can be viewed as ""video-dumping"", and then leave without so much as a trace

Then you have the ""feedback threads"" that popup from time to time in /new/, and promise to provide every video posted a healthy helping of constructive criticism. The problem with this, however, is that many of these threads become nothing more than a place for the OP to discreetly plug their own channel, other users to drop off their videos, and where the advice offered goes little beyond just ""Increase the volume of your voice"".

The point I am trying to make here this: Users are encouraged to submit their Let's-Plays and comment on other people's Let's-Plays; most of the time, not look at any of the other submissions others are making, and wonder why they are not getting any new viewers or feedback on their own channel; as a result, some of these LPers will eventually give up posting here and move on to other communities, or worse: drop their channel altogether, as is unfortunately the case sometimes. So in the end, we are still essentially drowning in a sea of video-dumps

Once again, *community.*

Phew... sorry about the wall of text

**TL;DR:** Forcing users to submit playlist-updates as text posts won't stop the endless number of come-and-go users, feedback threads feel like glorified video-dumps: if you're looking for constructive criticism on your videos, *Feedback Friday* posts are the place to start.

----

This project is very simple. You make a video

You upload the video to mediafire or filedropper or whatever

I download the clips

I'm very realistic about what a pain in the ass this is going to be to get done

This means that aside from the stuff that goes without saying (intentionally offensive junk

**Logistics and stuff**

----

Closing date for submissions: **March 20th

That's a week from now

If you want more time

Everyone's channel names (including links) will be listed in the description

I won't touch anything within your 10 seconds

**Technical Junk**

----

To keep things looking consistent

- 10 seconds or less in length

- 720p (if you're using 4:3 footage, really hate them)

- 25fps (Higher is fine

- LESS THAN 100MB in size (This is a hard limit

- Shoot for around -6dB across your audio. Make sure it never clips. If it's too quiet I'll have to turn it up for you

- No weird-ass file types (I'm not going to download a codec to import your soviet-era footage)

- If you choose to use music over your clip

- **Please use your channel as your file's name. I've had to rename at least 5 '10s thing' clips already.**

**Goals**

----

This project's aim is to celebrate Let's Playing as a genre

To be entirely clear: this project is not intended to increase anyone's exposure or sub count. Please don't expect anything out of this

Once again

This is simply an exercise for the community and a proof of concept for future collaborations

**Regarding Your Submission**

----

Be creative! No one wants to watch 20 vlogs of geeky dudes talking into a webcam for 10 seconds each. Use a combination of your old clips

You can do absolutely whatever you want

If your clip is heinously bad (Camcorder Minecraft footage while you talk about your brony atheist identity) it's not going in. I will cite this paragraph if you want to dispute it

If you want to work with someone else

1341967371.0,wcxd9,So I have been thinking...,ChristianTMI,27,5,10,"I would just like to say beforehand sorry for the wall of text:


Okay I have this terrible thing where I get really attached to small subreddits (see /r/truecreepy). I fall in love with the community and try to make it the best it could possibly be. So at night when the insomnia kicks in I start to think about ways to improve things


1) Bring back the weekly thing. Remember back when we had feedback Friday, but it was something. Well what if we bring it back but make it more fleshed out. First thing, go to /r/gamedev and check out Screenshot Saturday. Each week they have a different ""theme."" Like controversy, or whatever. This keep things interesting and would prevent people from just pasting links to their playists in the weekly posts. It could be a rule that you have to adhere to the week's theme, this could also spark discussion and thus make it pretty damn awesome. I would gladly be responsible for 
thinking of a theme each week and making the post. 

2) Stop being so damn stingy people. When I made my first weekly update post thing I got 7 upvotes. 7!(Great, first person that comes to mind that really does comment on a lot of the posts, even though he was severely constructive, i cried a little, in terms of criticizing my let's play is ArmoredChocobo.

3) Whilst I am on the topic of comments: would it kill you to type out two sentences, maybe even years now. We want you to say, hey your mic is not great here is a link to a great one that is super cheap. You can't expect people to comment if you don't comment. It is a boomerang effect, do unto other something something. I think you get the idea.


4) Mods

5) Discussions: I think that a weekly discussion thread would be awesome! Maybe a poll type of thing, for example


CHALLENGE:
Every week when you update your lp here

NOTE: I am probably coming off hypocritical since I don't always comment on here

I sincerely hope I didn't offend anybody and that at least one person takes what I said to heart.

Well I am done now

1. Do not do shoutout contests or Featured Channel give-aways. If you are popular

2. Do not Comment/spam your channel/videos on other people's videos. Would you like that to happen to you? Make sure it's someone whos videos you like to watch and connect with the person first and make friends. Then start talking about your channel/videos.

3. Do not add thumbnails that promise something else instead. No thumbnails of Skyrim with bikini models.

4. Do not use an arrogant intro when promoting your channel on a forum. Or in your videos.

5. Do not copy other people's videos or attitude. Staying yourself will give you a better audience and less thumbs-downs.

6. Do not roleplay unless you are good at it or bad in a funny way. (Neither voice immitations)

7. Do not use trial versions of recordingsoftware that leave watermarks. Buy it.

8. Do not act immature outside recording when replying to others. Fun is important

9. Do not stretch/shrink your video in resolution nor stretch/shrink your video timelength. Unless you have to.

10. Do not record the screen with a webcam.

11. Do not make too long or too short videos. 10 to 20 minutes is acceptable. Too short is a waste and too long is a drag. It also depends on your audience. If they want more

12. Do not force to be funny or scared or angry or whatever. Be yourself

13. Do not talk about your groceries unless you are shooting vegatables with your p90 or whatever. Keep your stories related. Unless your audience really likes your story times.

14. Do not talk through game dialogues, if there is any, so people can read it too.

15. Do not talk

16. Do not rage on other people. Show them you are better than that. Unless this is your channels theme.

17. Do not publish audio/video-testing recordings. Even if you consider it to be Episode 1. You better make a new Episode 1 if it sucks. You can upload it as Private or Unlisted to check things out.

18. Do not sub4sub. Having subscribers for nothing is worth... nothing. You may look popular but your videoviews shows otherwise.

19. Do not use bots to make fake views.

20. Do not eat or drink while recording. Chewing isn't adding quality to your content. If you have to

21. Do not be abusive or a racist.

22. Do not use names of famous people in your tags. (Will Smith

23. Do not make extremely long intro videos (20+ sec). People will eventually just skip them.

24. Do not continu a serie if you think the game is boring or not enjoyable to do commentary for. Tell your subscribers in a video why. Then you can leave them up or make them private for you to look back to. Many bigger names who do LPs also just quit a game and never look back. They sometimes don't even tell why they stopped.

1326135597.0,o9m32,Tips for LP Newcomers,gospelexe,23,1,16,"I noticed on the previous page of this subreddit that someone was asking for LP advise for newcomers. I have come to you with a few of my personal tips that I have learned either from myself or from other LPers. I will see if I can give examples/comparisons for each of the following sections below as well. Note that I am not an expert at recording LP videos

(I noticed that there was [a comprehensive guide to growing your fanbase on YouTube](http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/fpige/hey_rletsplay_i_wrote_a_comprehensive_guide_to)

* **Motivation:** A great way to start an LP is to be motivated by doing so, while his Side LP videos lean toward the 10-12 minute marker (fairly shorter games), and these videos are spread out on just about a daily basis, which keeps his contents spread out for viewers to look forward to every day. However, there are some LPers out there that do make marathon videos out there, which people also like, so length of videos isn't a HUGE factor, then feel free to make longer videos

* **Equipment:** It is advised to use proper equipment. For computers games, or maybe you can nab a copy of FRAPS somewhere. However, programs like FRAPS are *SUPER EFFECTIVE*, but not always free. If they aren’t free, they might not be that difficult to find on the web anyway. For console games, especially on current-generation consoles, see if you can invest in a decent capture card that goes from your console and/or television to your computer for the best quality. I have seen people use camcords and digital cameras or phones for LPs, and it is just not the greatest thing to use. If you want to do an LP from a handheld system, which then can be transferred with a capture card.

* **Knowledge/Experience:** - A good LP is particularly an LP that you are very experienced and knowledgeable in. The more experience you have with a specific game, and I have been playing that game for years now. I enjoyed commentating on that game and what I knew of it, and it seems like my viewers have also let me know that it was fairly informative and enjoyable as well because I have been so experienced in it. Unlike my failed LP, Legend of Mana (which is now taken off of YouTube due to discontinuation), it was a completely Blind LP for me, which I DID enjoy making, but there were so many rookie mistakes that people would rather not watch

* **Speech:** I would not say that a good LP is NOT based on how fluent your language of choice may be. Take professors and teachers in school, since he could actually be the best teacher you have ever had. So that shouldn't be the least of your worries, but as mentioned above, try dishing out information for your audience to keep them well aware of what’s going on, whether it be concepts, story, mechanics, etc.

* **Learn:** Don’t worry about perfection in LPs. We ALL make mistakes at least once in LPs, you will have a great amount of experience to learn from your mistakes in previous LPs, and compare the old LPs to what you have now. Watch other people’s LPs and observe on how they elaborate on the details they give out at a steady rate. As I have mentioned MANY times, HCBailly started out… I don’t know, maybe a little dull? Now his videos are filled with great excitement, joy, and enthusiasm for his viewers

* **Have fun:** I would say that this is probably THE most important part of LPs. Why do you want to do an LP? Because it's fun, and you would be wasting time for yourself and others, and quite possibly money as well should you decide to invest in equipment specifically for LPs. Just have fun with the game, narration, scheduling, take these wise tips into account, and do whatever is most comfortable for you.

And for those who prefer a TL;DR version of my “guide” on LPs and of what I have learned:

* **Motivation:** Be motivated to work on an LP. It will help you to keep on going

* **Equipment:** Use proper equipment for best quality. Using devices like digital cameras

* **Knowledge/Experience:** Try to do a game that you know very well. While this not required

* **Speech:** Don’t worry too much on speech, but WHAT you say that keeps your audience’s attention for your information on the LP.

* **Learn:** Much like a life lesson, and revise on your old LPs to see how you can fix your mistakes that you made in those for future reference in future LPs.

* **Have Fun:** This is pretty self-explanatory. Keep things steady

1360023221.0,17wej6,So Youtube just revealed their new layout,nordegrafgaming,22,2,101,"So fellow Let's players and redditors

http://www.youtube.com/user/sortedfood

This is what the new layout looks like and here is my take on it.

* The Good

The Playlists

The Playlists on the bottom of the page look more sleek and organized now and that pleases me greatly

* The Kind of Good but Arguable 

Smaller ""Featured"" video window

The videos on the channel have a smaller window

* The Bad

No More channel backgrounds

Youtube has thrown branding and customization completely out of the water, it's not even as good as the last header where you could put links to other channels or social media since now it's just a boring gray tab with links to your other pages.

* The Uncertain

I Can't trully tell you how customizable this layout is not having access to it myself, from iJustine's channel it seems like it is indeed possible to choose what video goes on your channel page.

I ask of you fellow Let's players, i'd love to hear your opinion

Ps.: Something i forgot to mention, I can't confirm this but i've tried that here and it seems true, what the hell?

I'm going through some youtube funk right now and i made this post to share how i'm feeling and maybe help those going through the same.

So, and to me that’s amazing, and I’m posting here to share how i’m dealing with the fact that i’ve had 23 subs for about a month.

First:

Stay positive

If i learned anything from wowcrendor and jesse cox is that it takes a while before you start getting subs, if you have a channel that’s been inactive for a month, people will just assume you stopped releasing content and won’t take the time to actually watch your videos.

Second:


Keep doing what you’re doing
I release a video everyday

Third:

Talk to people

Can’t get simpler than this, and that’s ok, but when you’re starting out, it’s important to keep talking to them, they are your first subs, and they are important, also be sure to make friends with other people doing what you’re doing and that share your interests.

Fourth:

Don’t let youtube rule your life

If you’re banking everything on youtube, getting noticed takes time, if you started because you admired other youtubers, remind yourself that most bigger youtubers now started actually a long time ago, some even more than a year, do other stuff besides youtube so you don’t get hung on the fact that it’s taking a while to get views.

Fifth:

Keep practicing

There’s always room for improvement, if you’re a lets player, play a game that you wouldn’t normally play, or a game that just looks interesting, be spontaneous from time to time, it keeps your content fresh and interesting and you’re always improving your skills.

and Last but not least

Be Hopeful

There’s about 7 billion people in the world and that’s a lot of people that can be watching your content, cut that in half again because half of that might not enjoy gaming content, thats 1.75 billion people that could be watching your content, and if you cut that in half because most people don’t have time to watch lets play, that still leaves you with… the fact that i’m horrible at math but that doesn’t change the fact that a lot of people can be watching your content, don’t get too hung up on the why they’re not watching you, i can’t stress this enough, and then the next with a thousand

And these are mostly the things that keep me from going insane from all this, i know it’s hard, but hang in there, things will get better if you just keep trying, be hopeful and make some awesome friends to help you get through the hard times. =)

LP Jam is a silly name but here's the idea: We specify a few games every week, talk about what we learned / how well it went for our own recording and give feedback on others.

There would be no restriction on how you wanted to approach the game (dual commentary, review, whatever) or the type of commentary.

Sort of like a game jam

**What's the point?**

Feedback Friday is awesome

There's a ton of people here who do genuinely want to improve

By limiting the game choices to a few every week, even if they don't get a ton of feedback, they've tried something new.

It also means members of the community here can leave feedback to people who are genuinely also taking part in the community instead of hit and run feedback / view whores.

It also means that people could get a lot of interesting ways to narrate / LP / film a certain title that you wouldn't pick up when we are all filming different things.

Unlike a lot of other community channel things that have come up in the past

**Where do the videos get uploaded?**

On your own channels! I know there have been community channel ideas here and I've seen the arguments against it

We could make a playlist at the end for all the videos.

**How do we pick the games?**

Not everyone has the same games, and a retro option (For people more into older games).

...So that's it. Let me know what you guys think, so at least one person is taking part ;)

I set a date two weeks in advance

16 hours.

That doesn't sound like much when charity marathons go for 24-48, maybe it was any number of things... but by hour 12 I was really struggling and it didn't feel like I was getting closer to completing a game I'd cleared many times in the past.

It was at this point that community made a difference, it was everyone. This was a test of stamina now, one that no one wanted to see end in failure.

I don't honestly remember much of the last 4 hours

I remember killing the final boss and the chat going nuts.

That last part is all I really need to remember. 

I think that celebrating milestones and goals are important. Be sure to reward yourself on the small things, I think it is okay to do something big, something for everyone.

### Let's Play Posting Guidelines

(By guidelines

##1. Submit Let's Plays as text posts.

If you are submitting a Let's Play, you may (and probably should) link to your video(s) and/or playlist.

With me so far?  [Don't panic.](http://caravanatchurchfarm.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dont_panic.jpg)


##2. Submit no more than one post per Let's Play per week.

This means that if you have one Let's Play going, [like](http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/1bwz3u/ccc_plays_black_mesa_17_discussing_science_while/) this [guy](http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/1bunaa/ccc_plays_bioshock_infinite_14_science_meets/).  If you have fifteen Let's Plays going... how the hell are you doing that?

This does not mean that you are at all required to split your dozens of Let's Plays into multiple text posts.  You can post all of your Let's Plays for the week in one text post, we love you and want you to have options.

##3. So what's this ""submit a new link"" button for?

Submitting a new link.

...

No?

Okay, like voice-y sound stuff or something, go ahead and post a direct link.

##4. Bonus advice!

(Not a guideline

Make your title interesting.  Make your post interesting.  Make yourself stand out from the *drop-and-run* style of posting.  Make us interested in watching your Let's Play.

Be a member of the community.  There's tons of great people here who are far too nice to strangers.  You may learn some useful information on improving your Let's Plays or find someone to collaborate with or even... [make a friend!](http://www.picgifs.com/wallpapers/wallpapers/horror/wallpaper_horror_animaatjes-44.jpg)

Consider visiting us in the [IRC channel](http://www.mibbit.com/#letsplay@irc.gamesurge.net).  We don't bite... hard... enough to draw blood... usually.

**What is it?**

*3-Minute Let's Play* is an idea I've had for some time

In my opinion, be more effective than a traditional, full-length Let's Play, especially for developing channels with smaller followings:

* **They are more likely to hold a viewer's attention** than an average 10-minute-long Let's Play episode.

* A subscriber is often **more likely to click on a 3-Minute video that is in their feed** as apposed to a longer one

* They are often faster-paced and ""easier"" to consume

* They can **act as ""Pilots"" for full-length Let's Plays**

These Let's Plays also have some drawbacks, as it leaves the viewer wanting more by the end of the video.

If you enjoyed the video or have any feedback on the *3-Minute Let's Play* format itself

*Thanks for watching!*

1369104981.0,1eqnz3,Nailing Thumbnails!,Thadiwyn,21,2,20,"Thumbnails are incredibly important.

They're the first thing someone's likely to see when scrolling past your videos. People notice thumbnails much more than titles at a glance.

They tell potential viewers a lot. Most obivously the game and the episode

(While not always true

I thought so).

The two pillars that thumbnails stand on is **clarity** and **interest**.

In short

---

**Note: This is more about the general concept of thumbnails

---

**In general**

+ The same/a very similar image across the entire playlist with usually just the episode number changed

+ The image/elements of the image pertaining closely to that episode alone

---

Now

+ **Make sure you can tell what the thumbnails about for god's sake!** Zoom away from your thumbnail in your image editor and make sure it's decipherable when small. It's easy to overlook!

+ Make a template where ever possible

+ 16:9

+ Avoid the bottom-right of the image like the plague. YouTube puts a timestamp there and anything you've put there gets hidden *(some people are saying that on mobile devices it's bottom left that's covered)*

+ Use the game's logo where possible

+ Use the stroke feature (or equivalent) to make a contrasting border for any used text

+ In general

+ Use a font that fits [the theme of] the game. Stay away from the likes of Comic Sans and Papyrus. Typing '&lt;Name of game&gt; font' into Google may even yield results if you're strapped for ideas.

+ Stay away from thin

---

Right

The key thing with these is

I obviously can't tell you what exactly to do here. As each thumbnail design must be fit for purpose

A good fall back if you're truly strapped for ideas is to go look at promotional art for said game (see the Batman example above, you'll never go far wrong if you compose well a number and maybe your own logo on promotional art!

If you're venturing into more creative endeavours... Then you don't rightly need me now do you? And Godspeed young thumbnail-san!

---

**The main problem with this type of thumbnail however

There are some things you can use to remedy that though!

... Something I've used for ages now (and have said before around here) is the use of hue/saturation adjustments across thumbnails

A common element (most often the background) can be linked to an [adjustment layer](http://i.imgur.com/PE71meY.jpg) that I gradually change the hue of with each thumbnail. This leads to a colour change down the playlist when looking at it on YouTube.

So

Hopefully

[Taken from this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/1ejqok/suggestions_for_thumbnails/ca0x9gf)


---

Another type of thumbnail that fits here is the **mostly text thumbnail!**

And while I've never used this style

Again, which I find -despite conveying all the information it needs to- far from eye-catching.

The slightly translucent black band across the middle also goes a long way to make the text pop out!

---

**Now for thumbnails that relate specifically to events in the episode!**

The best example I've seen of this style is our dear [ChristopherOdd](http://www.youtube.com/user/ChristopherOdd).

He has a distinct template that he's made - *semi-circle and episode number in top left

He'll then take a screenshot

The [LinkCableShow](http://www.youtube.com/user/linkcableshow) goes the other way and does it well too! 

Having the background and colour palette conserved across each thumbnail and adding [concept/promotional art](http://imgur.com/a/wNf5J) from the game being played. Sometimes even going in a more creative direction and [using something more stylised](http://imgur.com/a/bTFLr) while still retaining their own look.

It's like I said

---

**MOST IMPORTANTLY**

This is only what I've found to work and seen to work for others. While this may prove helpful

**Find your own style with your own creative flair and even by taking elements of people's thumbnails you like and incorporating it into your own!**

1355858993.0,152dim,My LP story. How I started and where I am now.,Bortobob,20,4,12,"So, who at the time did the playing and the commentary. This friend had years of improv under his belt, and rarely had dead air. Even if his gameplay itself wasn't skilled

Over the course of the first year, being my friend's absolute favorite game, by far. A clear winner! Got that beat, happy as could be. To swing the pendulum the other way, I had him play Amnesia. The amnesia series is our most watched series to date, but he's deathly afraid of the game. I do plan on making him play the second, but he REALLY doesn't want to.

After Amnesia, DKC2, and others. Disappointingly, he didn't seems to care for them much, if at all. Later was Penumbra.

Eventually, so I didn't feel I had the tools for a good performance. But, I just wanted to play games and make people laugh. Or at the very least, entertain. And I still feel that way, somewhat. I'm much more comfortable commentating than I ever have in the past. But, back then, I was like everyone else when they first start. I had dead air, or I didn't even say them because I was afraid. To be blunt

I started to do my own thing on our shared channel more and more often. My videos got far fewer views/likes than my friend's, when my friend inevitably started to become flaky. Missing scheduled days compelled me to make videos in his absence. Soon, it was almost nothing but me putting up videos while my friend was at class/work/family/whatever. So, I stopped posting to our shared channel, and made my own channel. He hasn't uploaded a video or comment on the shared channel since I stopped contributing.

The shared channel had over 300 subs, with the Amnesia series thousands of views. My new channel started ten months ago, with Alan Wake. My very first solo game commentary, with my younger brother watching occasionally. It was a transitory series, my Alan Wake LP... I went through a large range of emotion as I made my way through the game and recorded it. I felt angry at my friend for becoming a flake and abandoning our fun. I felt sad that my new channel had a generous helping of ten subs that followed me over from our shared channel. I was excited for the potential of my personal channel. I was scared of being mocked because of my commentary skills, without a friend to back me up. By the time I had finished, I didn't want to do it any more. I stopped making videos for two months.

Then, I loved portal! This game will probably be pretty good! I should do a gameplay video of it..."" I started to become excited about making videos again. I love puzzle games. I loved portal! I wanted to share my adoration with others. I wanted to have other people enjoy this game. I wanted to share.

Thanks to that game, playing a game that I really enjoyed working through got me out of that slump. I could feel the difference between playing for other people, instead of playing for myself.

After Conundrum, and damn, I felt good about that. This new friend is really intense. He started off with Super Meat Boy. We whooped and hollered all day long, playing and dying on that game. The editing was fun, and it all was just a great time. And that continued. He saw how hilarious Amnesia was, and wanted to play that too. Eventually other friends joined in and we played all sorts of games, from minecraft to GuildWars (mostly pc games

While these people (In my opinion, you shouldn't be *concentrating* on subscribers and views, and you *should* be doing this for fun, but with any hobby, it's nice to measure your progress. 

You can indeed measure your progress by seeing how you have improved in your own opinion by watching old videos. But then you need to ask yourself your end goal? If you like playing games then why not just play them? Why record and edit footage, measuring progress with a subscriber number is indeed fair. **Before you flip out** this shouldn't be your only drive for doing this, if you have even a small audience and 1-2 subs that watch your stuff, you're technically entertaining, so you're achieving your goal.

But larger goals are important, SEO, public speaking etc etc are applicable in real life, so even if you don't get far, it's good to improve. 

It's also important not to get too attatched to these goals

**How do you manage your goals? What do you do to keep yourself from being dissapointed if you don't hit them? What do you do to celebrate if you do? Tell me all about them!**

1358476249.0,16sje5,Methods for building subscribers,eeleyes,17,2,16,"Method sharing time

Having worked on a few podcast and other channels that have already been build I have decided to start my own channel of lets plays. Noticing how hard it is to get initial views I starting some studying and came up with some method based on knowledge

* Twitter

Twitter is fantastic for PR if you have subscribers. Now a catch twenty two I need to build subscribers on twitter to PR my channel. So how does one do this

* Reddit

I am assume because you are here you know how Reddit works. Now reddit can be good but it can also be a huge waste of time, never! 
However the best way to work this is to reply to other post of similar interest. Doing a video on FTL, *well here is my speed run I did a bit earlier, not very fast but you could pick up a few tips*.

* Message boards

One approach which has worked hugely for me in the past is forums. Spending about 30 minute twice a week I would go to the same board (alternating each week) and post a question like *hey guys I just started watching lets plays and I found xxx can anyone suggest something similar*. After a day or two I would check back and reply to some messages

* Meta data

Posting a new video and not sure on the tags to use? Check what others are using. Find a popular video similar to yours and right click on the page to view source information (right click &gt; view page source). Look for the tag that says &lt;meta name=""keywords"" content=""xxx

The words in the commas are what these people are using for tags.

* Video responses 

This one is a bit of an effort but if you can spare the time find some smaller channel that still allow vid response (bigger channels wont) and make a response vid. Doesn't have to be long but your chances of grabbing some subscribers is alright. Remember dont try to trick people or lie about anything. Nobody want that shit.


Try a nice simple *""So xxx I have been watching your videos and I though that i would give this game a try""* and then inculde a few minutes of gameplay. **Try not to exceed 3 minutes because people who do not care about you yet will stop watching. Smaller is MORE**


* Liaising

On method pointed out by [Blammelton](http://http://www.reddit.com/user/Blammelton) is connecting with other smaller channels. Spend some time watching and subscribing to other smaller channel. Make sure when you do this you ensure that you are commenting on their videos

Remember though

The best part is not only will you find some cool channels (as much as I hate too say it but gamegrumps are not the only funny channel out there) but you might pic up a thing or two to improve on your channel.

For now that is it but leave some comments and we can add more to the list.

For those who don't know
  
I have some basic idea that I'd like to propose. Something like this:
  
* A topic is made by someone every ~~Friday~~ Sunday
* People pick 3 to 5 Let's Plays that during that week you think were interesting, or... wathever. Maybe we could do without the minimum number and just put a cap of maximum 3 recommendations per week?
* It doesn't matter if the person is famour or not, text-only, AAR, etc. It only matters that you think that it's worth the recommendation.
* No self-promotion
* Try to not turn into r/circlejerk by only posting things made by people of this subreddit. I'd not say to prohibit it
* Explain your recommendation. Example:
  
&gt; ""I thought that [Insert Name Here]'s *macho-redneck-manchild* comedic persona would never work and make this unbearable to watch
     
or   
&gt; ""I've been following [Name Goes Here]'s work for some time now and she finally got 100 subscribers - a well deserved number considering the quality of the work she has been putting out all this time - so I think it's worth checking her"";   
  
or   
&gt; ""[Crafty Trendy Nickname]'s Let's Play Final Fantasy VII at LiveJournal just ended. It's a hilarious experience where she LPs as Cloud's personal diary over-blowing the angst of the protagonist into an emo teenage for *teh lulz*. Worth every second I spent reading"".

I figured this might be useful for those who have the bandwidth to upload this kind of file and might be concerned with it.

I had been hearing from many people about this ""Original"" quality trick on YouTube, change the oil or something.

So after @GopherGaming, is that YouTube allocates much higher bandwidth for a video in the original category, and you simply upscale your video to make it into that Original quality bracket. At first I thought this was simply ridiculous. Obviously upscaling would cause aliasing problems and would cause the bitrate to be stupid. 

I was wrong.

Dead... wrong...

It appears the Original option which for a long time was reserved for up to 4096x3072 (4k Cinema files) still had seemingly the same bitrate, grass went from watercolors to something actually... looking like grass, and rocks went from styrofoam to textured lumps. It's wonderful.

It's a very simply process,False,self,t5_2qss1,False,,youtube,t3_1knbtn

I lurked here a lot with an alternate username but I thought we could get a good advice and feedback thread going. I haven't been doing this very long, and also give some feedback. So if you have a question, post it below and I'll see what I can do. If you want me to feedback on some of your content, post it and I'll take a look! (I'll be basing my feedback on the first few minutes though because I wanna do as much of this as I can, so pick your video wisely!)

Also, please do, I'm by no means an expert and would appreciate some help on this. This ***IS*** a stupid questions amnesty though, so let's not mock anyone for asking something they might have been scared to previously, haha.

**I'm giving the same advice to a lot of people

- Sounding enthusiastic is *really* important. Not overly enthusiastic and forced (This is just as bad as bored, if you sound bored, your audience probably is too, because it's contagious, you aren't engaging them. Try smiling while recording, as the smile is audible in your voice.

- Game choice can be quite important, because slow progress is boring, and learning controls and stuff is slow.

- Practice makes perfect. Cliche but probably more relevant to YouTube than the usual cliche uses for it.

Was it for an automatic-parntership you didn't think you could get otherwise? Was it because you needed to hurdle the ""Content-ID wall""


As an independent YouTuber, and likely see RPM totals north of $8 with long-form LP content. Whereas, many networks' starting offers take 30% of your earnings, and offer flat RPM rates of only $2.00. Is the promise of ""promotion"" or ""protection"" from these networks enough incentive to give up so much of your income?

Pre-TL;DR TL;DR: Worried I'm becoming Phil Fish the Second.

---
A few weeks ago I was having major problems with enthusiasm. I wasn't wanting to record or edit anything, boredom with the current game I'm LPing, inexperience with editing etc.

so I went out of my way and talked myself through how to fix these problems. I started a once-a-week series where I play whatever I like

You can probably figure out, and made no attempt to hide that in the video. I ripped in to it, gave it a few positives and thought nothing of it. I'd done that before and nothing bad ever happened. Except, turns out a lot of people really like this game and it has gotten pretty good reviews. I got slammed, then the good reviews the game got made me think I was wrong about my review and have made me not really trust my own opinion.

Fortunately, I still got a load of comments ripping in to me, calling me a faggot, y'know, usual Youtube shit. I was a bit pissed at first, and I haven't had the best week IRL either, but overall nothing I couldn't handle. Even got some advice from TotalBiscuit which helped.

However, nothing I can't handle.

However, and have luckily not blown up at anyone, but the simple, knee-jerk reaction to get angry at criticism, even from people I respect, is worrying me. Especially when you consider just the week before I'd specifically asked for critique on how to improve my videos and took what was said on board. It's been like night and day and I hate it.

I don't want to get in to the frame of mind that the opinion of the commenter doesn't matter just because it's hurtful, and worst of all **I am getting anxious uploading videos because of the reaction they could get.** I have only recorded one video since all this happened, and that one wasn't very good.

Basically, blow up and then bob's your uncle I'm branded as an asshole. It's all totally irrational and I can't shake the feeling.

Any suggestions beyond ""Suck it up"" and ""stop being a little bitch""? I've been leaving the usual ""Thanks for watching!"" comment

Thanks for any help.

_______________________________________________

**What is Networking?**

   Put simply, and should include things like: Getting feedback from them, collaborating with them, sharing ideas and knowledge, etc.  It is, of course, not only limited to those things, when you get down to it.


_____________________________________________________

**Okay

Well, but honestly, what's the worst that can happen? They say no, and you move on? Exactly. So go ahead, champ! Ask away!


________________________________________________________________

**Okay

Ah

&gt; Hey MrMillionViewsAnHour! WATCH MY SHIT PLEASE DO IT AND MAKE ME FAMOUS 

Yeah, but you also run the risk of people finding you to be annoying as hell, then in some cases maybe even going and just downvote bombing your channel. Yikes.

Now

__________________________________________________________

**Commenting on videos**: 

&gt; But Jake

No, and comment away, comment in a manner of saying something like ""**Hey CoolPerson44, I really enjoyed that part of your video when you shot the guy in the noggin. I think you're doing a great job, keep it up!**""  Now, I'm not saying stroke a person's ego on every single video, and this works best with **Smaller** channels. 90% of the time, say, it's just there are MILLIONS of other comments

Look, if you are a repeat customer for a channel, and consistantly leave comments and feedback, they'll notice. I promise. Will this 100% guarantee you a collab spot with them? No. But it will put you on they're radar, and sometimes they might even check out your channel, sub, and you can start to build a relationship.

____________________________________________________________

**Twitter

Twitter is a powerful tool. There's no doubt about it.  Chances are

But seriously, don't spam them, that just makes you seem needy and annoying.  Basically, just have casual conversations and discussions with them through Twitter, like you would a normal person (well, I mean they ARE normal people!), and again

Chances are, provide feedback, or even help give you a nice little bump (both in views and in subs.) 

So you just covered a hot new indie game and are really excited about your video? FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, and if you're not totally trashing their game, they will probably retweet your video, which means more views, more subscribers, and maybe even more people to collab with.  

Know who follows that indie game dev you just showed your sweet-as-hell video to? More indie devs. And guess what, and might even five you a review copy.  (see, networking hard at work!) Twitter is a powerful tool, **USE IT**


________________________________________________________________

**Okay

Okay, I know.

**Reddit** is potentially more powerful than Twitter. There, and don't be afraid to say something like ""Hey, I really liked your video! I think we have a pretty similar style, If you'd like, maybe we could do a video together some time"" or something along those lines.  Chances are, they'll be more than happy to give you a look over, and probably even collab. 

So, etc. What else can you do on Reddit?

Post your video to the subreddit for that game


____________________________________________________________


**Last but not least, and forums**

So, I bet some of those friend would LOVE to collab with you. Would love to see some of your videos. Now, don't be pushy.  Subtle hints, say, like ""Hey, I did this funny thing in TF2."" If they watch that video, chances are they will check out the rest of your stuff and maybe even share it with others. These types of interactions lead to collabs.  Don't ever discount the games you play online

I have very little experience with forums, but remember,  just because you don't collab with some one, doesn't mean they can't give you feedback, or other things.


_____________________________________________________________

**Epilogue...***

Still awake? Awesome! Hopefully I was able to show you, and the wrong way to network, and some basics.. Thanks for reading, and good luck, my LP pals!

**TL;DR:** Don't be a pushy mother fucker. Don't comment on videos begging for views and subs. Just interact with your fellow human being through YT, Reddit, etc. like it's a casual conversation. &lt;3

1367452168.0,1dilp9,A few suggestions to improve r/letsplay,Bubbleking87,18,4,17,"Hey everyone

1. No more ""I just reached xxx number of subs"" threads please. Honestly Im very happy for you and I even upvote the threads but they contribute very little and only block up the front page

2. No more ""hey I will give feedback threads"" cleverly disguised as ""oh here I'll also post my channel"" give feedback for 2 posters and then use all the upvotes to generate traffic for your own channel. We all know what Im getting at here. If you want to give feedback thats fine. Leave your own channel out of it if people are grateful for your help they may check it out of their own accord.

3. I feel that if someone is looking for feedback on their own work then they should be around for a certain period of time. You dont have to be commenting in every thread but I'm more likely to look at your stuff if I recognize the username and saves me getting burned by dump and go merchants.

Look at the end of the day we are all here to learn how to make better videos and interact with other members of the community.

I was asked by ReverendDS if I would like to organize the weekly ""Feedback Friday"" post here on /r/letsplay

What do you guys want to see in a weekly post? Anything at all, because this subreddit should be more than a place to just plop your video. We're a community of hard working content creators, and we will have a Feedback Friday post that shows it! :P

Recently I went back and 'remade' one of my earlier videos. The reason being, if you're curious). Well now I finally went back and redid that video, and I intend to actually finish my Witcher playthough (finally!). When I look back and compare the first video to my new one I'm amazed at the difference I can hear. I'm quite proud of myself actually.

1357669959.0,1672d6,Which Games/Companies Match Third-Party Content on Let's Plays on YouTube?,LehanBeard,17,4,40,"I was just curious and I'm trying to compile a list of game companies that flag gameplay in the Content ID Sytem of YouTube (i.e. Match Third-Party Content). I'm listing the ones I know about

**Warning:** I take no responsibility if the publishers decide to change the way they operate and you end up being hit with copyright strikes. Please

**Gameplay Related**

* **Konami** matches visual content in gameplay videos of it's franchises (and I tested it with mute videos for Castlevania and Metal Gear Solid, neither voice acting. It's the actual gameplay). Confirmed for pretty much every Konami franchise - including Castlevania, Metal Gear Solid, Gradius, Suikoden. 

* **Sega** has been taking down videos of Shining Force recently

* I know **Atlus** matches third-party on the opening videos of some their games - Persona 3 and 4

* **Capcom** had at least one Match Third-Party content incident that I known on Lost Planet and Mega Man vs Street Fighter (confirmed by /u/RockLeeSmile and /u/Bolshok) but it seems completely random. Resident Evil 6 is also getting third-party content matches due to cutscenes. *Difficulty of dispute unknown

* **Disney**'s Club Penguin games trigger visual content Match.

* **Eletronic Arts (EA)** - Cutscenes may be matched by the content ID system (confirmed for Dead Space 2). They also may match content on gameplay of Battlefield 3. Disputing the claim is apparently easy.

* I heard about people getting visual matches from **Sony** for Killzone 3 videos

* **Square-Enix** had some content ID matches with Final Fantasy XIII and Dissidia Final Fantasy around the time of release. *Needs information about current situation.*

* **Microsoft**'s recent [EULA update](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/developer/rules) seems to open the way for them to use the Content ID System

* **Namco Bandai** had a Visual Content ID Match ID spree in Mid-2011 that seems to have continued to Mid-2012. No idea about the current situation but it seems they stopped

* **Ubisoft** - Mostly due to cutscenes being used as promotional material. Assassins Creed III Opening may be matched by IDOL due to the opening theme. Far Cry 3 while being chased by Vas. Disputes apparently successful and without major hassles.

* **THQ** triggered visual content match on Darksiders and Darksiders II. Apparently it's due THQ's logo on the opening credits. They also seem to match cutscenes in certain games (confirmed for Saints Row). 

* **WWE games** may be tagged by THQ (the publisher) or even by WWE itself as they are VERY protective of their trademark. From my knowledge disputes are usually not accepted. *Needs more information.*

* **Riot Games** may match visual content on League of Legends but dispute should be easy considering their [**Official Policy on YouTube and Streams**](http://www.riotgames.com/legal-jibber-jabber) videos (which allows monetization).

* **Inazuma Eleven** videos may be matched to content of 【**イナズマイレブン 仲間**】 (*Inazuma Eleven Nakama*). It may or may not be an official representative of the franchise/license

* Pretty much any non-public Alpha/Beta/Leaked Build/Pre-Sale Date video without specific authorization will warrant a take down due to the source of the footage being acquired illegally or for breaking a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA).

* Cutscenes that are distributed as PR and for promotional material may be tagged by the Content ID System by the publisher or gaming news outlets. Difficulty of dispute depend on which was the source of the claim

-------------------
  

**Music Related**

* **Bethesda**'s games may be matched third party due to the company that composes musics for their games (IMG). Match is easy to dispute.

* **Mist V** has soundtrack music claimed by Riptide. Difficulty of dispute unknown. *Needs more information*.

* **Square-Enix**/**Eidos** has music protected by collecting societies in Sleeping Dogs that can get your video flagged. You have to keep the radio turned off.

* **Rockstar** also has the same deal with music in some of the GTAs.

* **Far Cry 3** has commercial music on the game.

* **Initial D** games (published by Sega) and other japanese rythm such as **ParaPara Paradise** games are usually flagged and taken down due to eurobeat music by the **AVEX group/records** - for some reason they are VERY aggressive in protecting their eurobeat IPs (more than their singers from other genres). **May give you an actual copyright strike.**

* Nearly all Rythm/Dance games due to music publishers.

* Many Japanese games use J-Pop/Rock songs in their openings and that may get your videos flagged. You may need to replace the opening song or cut the video.

* Pretty much any game that uses actual commercial music will need to either have the songs turned off or cut from the video to avoid a copyright claim from the record labels. **Channels have been taken down by it

* Some games may have classical music on it and you may get a claim on the video from a collection society or record label that produces and sells *royalty-free* packages despite the music themselves being public domain because the actual recording may not (or may be erroneously matched to one that isn't). Those are easy to dispute

1. Record video!
1. Edit your video.
1. Render your video out using the highest possible settings
1. [Download Handbrake!](http://handbrake.fr/)
1. Import your giant ass video file!
1. [Use these settings
1. In the area where it says target size you have to do some math. Simply take the length of the video and multiply it by around 40-50 then you get the recommended file size for full HD!
1. Click play and do something else

That is it

1369872923.0,1faym1,Using LP's to break out of my shell... a work in progress,ShiverTwitch,17,2,11,"Hey everybody
I recently decided that I was sick and tired of being such a shy and socially introverted person. Playing so much Skyrim, this eventually led to the realization that I was using Skyrim far too much as an escape from life, rather than a form of entertainment. So I decided to flip that around. I created a YouTube channel in the hope that it will serve as a positive influence in my life, and push me to try and connect with people, even if not in person. This would be a place to do all the things I feel I've wanted to do, but have been too afraid or nervous to.

I couldn't imagine a better start to channel than to create a Skyrim Let's Play. Skyrim has been such a source of stress relief in my life that it's really the most comfortable video I could think of making without totally freaking out and scrapping all my plans. So I had a few drinks (it's really quite amazing how brave alcohol will make you), and finally hit the record button for good. Now, after weeks of recording, editing, experimenting, and uploading I've decided to try getting it out into the public sphere and hopefully - with a little luck - build a bit of an audience to participate in future 'old school' (read: audience-directed) Let's Plays and other audience-driven videos.

While my socially anxious brain would be perfectly fine letting my little project rot among all the other LP's floating around YouTube, and critique it. So here I find myself, floating in a sea of e-personalities, inviting anybody and everybody to take a look at what could be the most outgoing thing I've done in years. Though my channel is intended for much more than LP's (in the future!), this playlist - the founding project - is perhaps the most important as it will help me to gauge what my potential audience wants to see, allow me to experiment with new methods of getting my story across and engaging my viewers, and with enough viewer input help shape the videos and projects to come :)


Here is ""technically"" the first video... but it's more like an hour-long monstrosity that needs to be removed and crazy edited.
So Unsatisfied's Let's Play Skyrim Modded p.0 (Drunken Introduction)

And here's the ""official"" first video...  much more neat and clean and a 
convenient 15-minute dungeon crawl.

So yeah, I know episode 0 is crazy long and confusing) and suggestions both through here and through YouTube comments.  Each person who gives one of my videos a 'thumbs up' - I owe you a hearty man-hug.  If somebody's day is so ruined by one of my videos that it deserves a 'thumbs down' - we can still be friends, I guess, but I would love to know what garnered the downvote (so I can fix it in future videos, just for you!).

**Video text** (what text would you like your video to have? Example: channel name and maybe a slogan or something? channel name should do it though)           
**Style** - I'm still learning, I can try. You can just ask for example: ""*I want something clean, with the colors red and blue in it, like your Dota Noobs Intro video example*"" , I'm up for anything, as long as it's realistic, I still have no idea how to make some more complex effects.            
            
When I'm done with a request, so it will be a pretty big file).

1356127624.0,1590av,~The best tip I have ever found for improving your commentating skill~,TheJessaChannel,14,0,8,"Here it is:

**Read Aloud.**

I find Dr. Seuss

This helps me in several ways. It warms up my mouth. It acclimates me to hearing my own voice. It trains my tongue on how to move around without tripping over my teeth. :-)

It gives me confidence in my own voice. It helps me to get words from the page out of my mouth faster and still be intelligible. (This helps for those games where the text does not stay on the screen very long.)

It increases my vocabulary. (Okay, but there are many good books out there to read!)

It helps with the dreaded umms and ahhs and other speech pauses as your brain gets used to *thinking and talking coherently at the same time*.

My goal is to read aloud every day for 10 minutes or so as part of building my skill as a Let's Player.

So what say ye? Do you read aloud to build your commentating skill?

P.S.: In my five weeks of LPing

Edit: I just watched my first video again and what I notice most is how my breathing has improved.

Here are a couple things I think people should steer clear of:

* In LPs, but I've seen LPs that often felt rehearsed or scripted which isn't really good. Have an idea of what you're doing, but don't pinpoint everything you're going to do throughout the episode. Of course, having a good amount of structure in a guide or something of the likes makes sense... but I feel like that's not really how LPs are.

* Blind LPs. I'll probably get a lot of shit for this one, I don't want someone just reciting their knowledge of the game to me. There has to be a balance of knowing the game well and providing entertaining commentary. All in all though, I enjoy series where the LPer knows the game significantly more than series where the LPer is just blindly running through it. (That is of course, unless the LPer is doing a blind playthrough of a game in a series they are familiar with. Like doing a blind playthrough of Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate I'd say is acceptable if you've played earlier Monster Hunter games and you know them somewhat well.)

* Games that are always the same. Example being something like Bioshock, what's the fun in seeing someone who doesn't know the game? It's sort of a lose lose. Whereas if you played something that has varying elements to it (Binding of Isaac, Civ 5, etc.) you can be knowledgeable in the mechanics of the game but not have the game memorized because you'll never play it the exact same way. 2) If other youtubers have done it, what's so different about your LP? Why would someone watch through two series of Bioshock? Whereas with, say, FTL... no run is the same as the other

* Very popular games. Again, seeing as it's been played by a plethora of big youtubers. So your subs will see it and that's about it.

* Minecraft. As much as some people will be pissed at me saying this, everything was dandy. But then BAM! I decided I don't really enjoy Minecraft anymore, and stopped the series. Now my channel hasn't grown at fucking all in about a year, and my subscriber base is almost entirely dead. Minecraft fanboys, to put it politely, don't watch anything but Minecraft usually. It's a bad crowd to get in your fanbase. You've either got to play it forever or never play it if you don't want to end up with 98% of your susbcribers inactive. Honestly, don't get yourself in that mess.

* Fake enthusiasm. Don't be all bouncy and excited when doing a commentary. If you've got a monotone voice... fuck it, I'm looking for who can make enjoyable content.

A lot of these are personal opinions of mine

Note: *Please don't downvote people just because you disagree with them. Argue or tell them why you think they're wrong

A few months back my LP server was looking for new members, and selecting only a handful of members was more difficult than I thought it would be. Pretty much all the new members we accepted at that time came from here.

The people we accepted not only integrated nicely into our group, good friends.

Because of how great the turnout was last time, I'd make a post here and give you all first chance.

**A little about us:**

We are a group of people who focus mainly on Minecraft videos (LPs, etc) but all play and record lots of other games together. Ages range from one or two members who are 16 to about 20-35+ (I personally turn 30 next month). 

With the upcoming Minecraft 1.6 changes we are planning on doing a server reset and starting fresh on the pre-releases. (so knowledge on how to install and run the pre-releases is important

Once we accept a few more players, we'd invite the new members into our skype group, so they could get to know everyone and maybe play a few games.

Again

**What we are looking for:**

First off, and as such, we need members who can be respectful of that. That means no messing with other peoples stuff (of course jokes and ""pranks"" are OK, as long as they aren't destructive), being mindful that at any point there's probably someone on the server recording, and...for lack of better words, aren't assholes.

We don't care about your sub or view count, just made a channel to join the server) and none of those people ever worked out. It's OK if you never LP'd Minecraft before, but we do expect you to have some other videos up. Bonus points for people who've been doing it for more than a week ;)

So if you are interested in joining a great group of LPers, leave me a comment below. **Please tell me a little about yourself and link me to your channel.** (I'm only bolding this because of the amount of ""give me the server IP"" messages I received last time)

Feel free to ask me anything about the server, so I'm purposely leaving out info about the server or specific members, though I'm sure if you check my channel, you could easily find more info.

**P.S. if you applied last time and for whatever reason we didn’t accept you

**TLDR: Don’t bother

1368959709.0,1emimw,How does a Critical Let's Play work? - +Alternative Let's Plays,Critsplosion,14,2,13,"Hey everyone, instead of just posting the playlists

Before I get into it

_____________________________________

&gt;**Critical Let's Play:** *A way to organize the content of an LP focusing on analyzing any of a variety of topics within the game being played: story, etc.*

For me

So, but then anytime we try to add something to that process it takes like a billion more hours than we thought it would to get done... Blugh... 
Putting together these LPs for me has involved:

* Studying the critique around the game (especially Infinite
* Playing the game and re-watching footage for themes and expression
* Preparing ideas in some way around themes for each episode
* Sometimes that means writing scripts. -_-

This is the pretty standard way I put together my episodes

**So how's that stuff working out for ya

Interesting. The workflow listed above has essentially created video blog/LP hybrids centered around a variety of topics that sometimes link to the play happening live in the video, game critique-centered vlog that shows the entire experience of playing a full game.

One of my original questions when doing this was

**My favorite part** of doing a Critical LP is that I get a good section of [conversational dialogue from commenters](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-da8QcXN7M&amp;list=PLlbvnAUcEajOIyt_-X9_6Yh5aJEkm5EA3&amp;index=8) - others who want to discuss the ways I'm looking at the game

**The biggest negative** to this approach (besides the time investment) is that it is hard to stay focused. Analysis a game at the macro level conflicts with things happening in the moment of play, and then forget to get back to that original point. OR big thematically rich ideas will be broken up by the 'what was that?' moments in a game.

__________________________________________

At the very least, I think what you all do here is extraordinarily special. As I've [tweeted before](https://twitter.com/SolonCubed/status/335123157163843584), Let's Plays use games and gamespace as an easel for expression, they are artistic forms that examine games in a vast variety of fucking amazing ways. Every LP is special and important, we know that or we wouldn't put this much work into 'simply playing a video game'. What I do with this kind of Alternative LP is not about getting away from the ""status quo of LPs"", they are about acknowledging them and branching directly off from them to explore games in new ways.

If you have any similar examples to what I'm working on, or critique that involves your LPs in some way, please link it! All of you peeps with other examples of augmenting the usual LP experience (Alternative Let's Plays) LINK THAT NOISE!

Personally

____

##[Current Remedies]:
* Enforce a strict layout for each playlist submission.
* Enforce a tagging system and a title format in order to better differentiate post from post.
* Only allow Playlist submissions on a particular day

___

##[Strict Layout]
As [DuffKing56](http://www.reddit.com/user/duffking56) recommended:

1. Channel name

2. A description of the channel (1-3 sentences is all I'd think is needed here)

3. The episodes being posted with a 1 sentence description for each plot-wise or topic-wise since some do topic-based content.

4. Evaluate why you're posting the series or series'. This should be done for each series. This will give you and the reader a better chance to understand the point of the content and you may learn a thing or two about your objectives as a content creator. This point I think gets lost in the mayhem of recording

5. What were your objective for the week and where did you find trouble or find success in attempting to meet them. Here you'd incorporate constructive criticism from weeks previous and more self-assessment would be performed here.

6. Did anything interesting happen to you this week related to content

7. Where do you hope to go from here? This forces one to recognize a pseudo-goal for the coming week and is a source of motivation and reflection to last for the week.

If the post did not follow these guidelines to the teeth

___

##[Strict Tagging] 

I am mostly concerned with how the front page looks. I feel more like I'm sifting rather than happily surfing

**[Playlist][Game Name] [Your irritatingly creative title]**

Ex: [Playlist][Tetris] It's Rainin' Blocks!

____

##[Playlist Submission Dates]

Only allow playlists to be posted on certain days. Such as ""Let's Play Friday"" (Then channel critique Saturdays) or something of a similar caliber. This makes the majority of the discussion revolve around tips on enhancement and general quality awareness. 

I'd rather have a daily post that people ask how to increase their quality and subscriber base

___

Disclaimer: You may have seen some of the stuff before because I am copy pasting some stuff in cause I'm lazy.

I am actually partnered through Socialblade so I could get access to their support and their spotlight as well, if that makes sense (if it doesn't let me know).

I really like them. They are really active on their social media and their support is excellent. I haven't had issues with their support. I been a member for about ~5 months and so far so good.

I think they are definitely worth looking into but they may not be right for you. They have a one year contract but the payment split is 60% for you and 40% for them. They now offer a 50/50 plan and the contract is for two years. I personally don't know how you qualify for which. When I joined only the 60/40 planned was offered.

 Now while it is a huge cut in the 60/40 contract

As for the 50/50 cut I can't talk too much about it because I don't have experience with it

Their promotion is nice. ~~Especially if you partner though Socialblade/RPM because you have the ability to submit a video for Socialblade's partner spotlight as well as RPM's partner spotlight.~~ No longer an option. Socialblade has (temporarily?) stopped the Socialblade partner spotlight.

RPM also hosts ""watch-it Wednesday"" where you can link them your videos on twitter and they will pick some to feature on their facebook page.

RPM now hosts a ""RPM Spotlight"" which is similar to the Socialblade spotlight

What is cool about RPM is there is the ability to graduate into some of the higher networks

Overall I think RPM is great

1358760024.0,16zc7r,What do you guys love about LPs?,gokenshadow,13,1,20,"On a certain let's play forum, or something similar). The question kind of hurt me because in the haze of arguing with the users on that forum

So the question made me feel like shit, hard, searching desperately for reasons why I wanted to let's play. I searched and searched my mind, but alas, possibly due to the haze of feeling like shit, I couldn't think of a single good reason. I started to doubt myself. Perhaps I was being selfish. Perhaps I shouldn't be doing let's plays. 

Then my mind did something funny. Instead of coming up with reasons I wanted to let's play, not a stupid list of pointless things."" But my mind insisted, so I listened and made a short list of some of the various things that I loved about LPs. Here is said list:


&gt;I love it when LPers get nostalgic about video games and talk about how they reacted to certain monsters or levels when they were kids.

&gt;I love it when they go off on tangents about personal history, adventure, game mechanics, movie opinions, and all sorts of other things that have nothing to do with the video game in question, yet are so interesting and engaging that they still add to the gameplay, and I love that moment when they realize how off topic they are, or being surprised by something unexpected

&gt;I love it when instead of going straight from point A to point B like some cogs in a machine, or try to break the game, or try to do a completely pointless maneuver game-goal-wise just because they think it would look cool or be fun or be hilarious (think of tossing grenades to flip trucks in halo 2; does anyone remember doing that? did no one ever do that besides me and my relatives?). 

&gt;I love it when they make mistakes

&gt;I love it when they think they've finally gotten past something and beaten it when, and how mind-inducingly angry it makes them. 

&gt;I love it when they finally actually succeed

&gt;I love it when they do the voices for the characters in non-voice-acted rpgs with a consistency that makes me believe that their voices are the characters speaking. 

&gt;I love it when they give shoutouts to fellow LPers who they think could use some more attention, and fun pieces of banter that arise from doing so. 

&gt;I love it when they have such an appreciation for the music, the gameplay, or any other part of a video game, that you can hear it in their voice and tone, and they sound like a little kid who just got a ""NINTENDO 64!"" for Christmas.

And then

&gt;I simply want to make LPs that incorporate the things that I love LPs for


Not only did the answer come to me, insulting people vanished into thin air, and I no longer felt like shit. I felt great. I felt like I wanted to make a let's play then and there. It was amazing.

Seeing how joyful I felt after I completed the list

What do you guys love about let's plays? What are the moments you cherish the most? Feel free to make a list or write a paragraph or write an essay or whatever you want. Let's share some love.",self,t5_2qss1,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/16zc7r/what_do_you_guys_love_about_lps/

You post a link in the comments below to your LATEST VIDEO

Reasons for doing so:

- I want to start an LP soon (first one) and want see all the little nuances that make an LP great as well as the ones that make it not so great. Also I want to train myself to avoid the bad ones.
- I am bored and think it will help some of you out
- I want to make myself feel better
- Feedback Fridays seem to have disappeared and nobody seems to be getting any comments
- Four points seem like enough


Anyway good luck.

1329336454.0,pr5bv,How to upload more consistently (and why that's important),ItsOppositeDayHere,16,4,11,"One of the pieces of advice I give frequently when I'm asked for feedback on someone's channel is to set and stick to an upload schedule. It's one of those things that might not seem like it's that important

There's two things I'm gonna be talking about with respect to an upload schedule: frequency and consistency. Frequency will refer to the sheer number of videos uploaded and consistency will refer to the amount with which those uploads stick to their expected timeframes. For example, it would be frequent but inconsistent.  

In my opinion

**Consistent and Frequent &gt; Consistent OR Frequent &gt;&gt; Inconsistent and Infrequent**  

I think it's common sense that, and they'll greatly prefer either over a channel that has infrequent videos uploaded at random times.  

The exception to this rule, recording, animating) and he can get away with it because the finished product is so good that people will seek it out whenever it's made. For most people producing LPs, though, you should at least be consistent **or** frequent (not everybody has time to do both.  

Anyway

**Tip 1: Set a release schedule for your videos**  

This doesn't necessarily mean you'll know exactly which videos will go on which day, 1/episode a week, etc. You get the picture. It's important to set a realistic upload schedule so you can stick to it. Don't pick 1/episode a day if you can't stick to that semi-reliably. Advertise on your channel what your upload schedule is so people know when to check back for content.  

Now

**Tip #2: Record in Batches**  

Rather than recording one video, record as many videos as possible in one session. For most people, recording time is limited because you want to do it during a time where nobody is around to disturb you and you're not disturbing anyone else with your narration. So, if you have a 2 hour block of awesome recording time, record the video/narration for 3 or 4 videos so you can render them all out at your leisure. For most people that will be close to a week's uploads all in one fell swoop.  

**Tip 3: Render/Upload Overnight**  

If you don't have a ballin' computer, you have time every night to render the video without actually having to be there to watch it.  

You can do this for uploading too although I'm not sure if non-partners can set their own publishing times. It's not a huge deal but generally I'd prefer to publish my videos at night rather than 3AM EST.  

This is yet another reason why recording in batches is so useful compared to recording 1 episode every day.  

**Tip #4: Build a Video Bank**  

So you've just recorded an awesome video but you've already uploaded your standard 1 episode for the day, but you're better off building up your ""video bank"".  

What I mean by this is, whereas if I'd saved those extra ones it wouldn't be a problem.  

This isn't a huge deal but trust me when I say that it's really comforting to have 10 videos made in advance so that if anything unforseen happens

And sometimes you will get golden gems of advice that alter your LPing perspective.  Like many others, the key to their success.  There was one over arching theme

So what's that tip in the title? 

As per many successful LPers

Oh

There are copious amounts of literature and publications discussing how simple flukes or strokes of luck can have a huge impact on our entire social structure.  YouTube, it's actually not that difficult to look into the tea leaves and get a sense of what games could be big for LPing in the near to distant future.

But that's the catch.  Being in the right place at the right time actually has a third element.  A hidden element.  One you may or may not already know: **preparation.** If you have not put the work in to be successful

So what does preparation mean? Practice.  Even if no one is watching, go into a video or a series looking to improve, and then work on improving it.  Is it your commentary? Your delivery? Your ability to play while commentating? Your A/V fidelity? Editing time? Tagging? Set goals, stick with them, and achieve them. Always work to improve.  Your viewers will notice and appreciate it (even if they don't always say it).  

So there's my few cents.  Is my channel still small? Yes.  Is this post worth a hill of beans? Probably not.  I don't think I've said anything controversial, but maybe the number I am most proud of is that my audience retention has skyrocketed -- people are starting to stick around and watch my videos.  If I had not worked so hard on improving the quality of my product, I doubt that would be the case.

The idea? Pick a game from below (they are either free

You have around 7 days to make the video - in a week

Test yourself, so you know you'll get a least one big piece of feedback!

If you don't make videos


**The (SIMPLE) Rules:**

* Pick a game from below and make a video. The video can be anything you like. It doesn't even have to be an LP

* Test yourself! Pick a game you would normally have never filmed

* We're looking for one video, a single 20 minute video will be sufficient.

* If you take part

* Drop a comment here if you intend on taking part or have any other feedback / suggestions.   
 

**The Game Choices:**

1. [Vox](https://indiegamestand.com/) - Voxel adventure and RPG game that looks vaguely similar to Minecraft

2. [Data Dealer](http://datadealer.com/) (Demo) - Data Dealer is a web game about privacy that's currently in [Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cuteacute/data-dealer) mode. The web demo hasn't had a lot of YouTube coverage and is totally free to play.

3. [Flashback](http://www.giantbomb.com/flashback-the-quest-for-identity/3030-1066/) (Retro) - Any version of 1992 platformer. The PC version should run well through Dosbox


**Uploading:**

* Upload your video as normal to your own channel

* You can upload your video as unlisted if you don't want it to interfere with your main channel.

* Once uploaded

* Don't post your video here before then - leave the feedback for the thread at the end of the week.


**Dates:**

This Saturday we'll post a thread to vote on games for the next round so I'm not picking them each time (Thanks to /u/Phedran for feedback on this).

Next Tuesday we'll post all the videos in a single discussion thread like Feedback Friday.

Next Wednesday we'll post up the next round of games.



**Taking Part:**

/u/Wayward1 - Probably going to try Data Dealer as I like the concept and have never filmed a web game before.

/u/ArpinArp - I think I'll give Flashback a try since I've never played it before

/u/agdan - I'll give Data Dealer a try as it seems like a great concept. :D

/u/Phedran - Attempting Vox

/u/AndresIndoril - I might give Data Dealer a try

&gt; I think the moderators should decide once and for all how they want things done here just so everybody has an equal chance of getting upvotes and recognition. If there was a way for links to stay on the front page for, I think that would be the best thing for this subreddit.

&gt; *-Anonymous

**TL;DR: The over saturation of individual links is causing many submitters to go unnoticed.**

What is your opinion?  Should individual episode links be prohibited?  Should playlists be the only acceptable way to submit a Let's Play here?  What would be a fairest solution for our ever-growing community?

Last Weeks Lessons

**Last Week's Lessons**

*Highest Scoring Comment*: Our top comment comes from /u/OhSnapLP who I had the pleasure of playing Payday 2 with last week. [Check out his channel if interested](http://www.youtube.com/imakelevels) 

&gt;1. Pay attention to your analytics and your traffic sources when attempting to advertise. I posted a weekly update here and got a whole 2 views (average of 4 seconds view time). Hurraaaaaaaaay... *cough* Adjust
2. Eh, about remoting into my computer at home, from work, and doing video renders. I'm using an old version of Vegas movie studio that doesn't have batch rendering. More time spent rendering when I'm not even at home means more time available to record new content when I *am* at home.  

*Jon's Choice*: My choice comes from user /u/Phedran

&gt; * Just ask (nicely) / Just try. You never know what could come of it! Alternate version: If you don't ask
* If you're restless and having trouble focusing, just don't wallow in frustration. Come back re-energized and ready to create.
* Sometimes you just have to rest

**Last Weeks Lessons**

*Highest Scoring Comment:* /u/ishyvideos gave us a lesson that while applied to ""Let's Plays"" can be applied to everyday life. 

""As stupid as it sounds. I've learned most recently to stop overthinking everything. Just play the games I want. Relax. Have fun. Then put myself myself out there to the public. Once you stop fearing failure. It relieves a lot of excess weight off your shoulders. Understanding that everyone will not like your videos


Basically broke through a lot of mental barriers this week.


Wish everyone the best.""

*A Personal choice From Jon:* /u/OhSnapLP helps us articulate our words to help us get our thoughts across.

1372254800.0,1h3vew,An Idea To Help You Gain More Subscribers.,SavedByInsanity,15,5,12,"**May be a bit lengthy

I have noticed that most of the people who post in this subreddit do so solely to just advertise their channel. There is a smaller percentage of people who post in order to ask for criticism. Then there is an even smaller amount of people who visit this subbreddit in order to actually find new people to subscribe to. I myself have no interest in beginning my own channel

**Some features of the website.**  

*Search/sort by style.*  

I will categorize all let's plays by style. Either informative, humorous, sarcastic, co-op, group, completionist, challenges

*Search/sort by specific video game.*  

You like Binding of Isaac, etc? You can just search a game title and you will receive a list of all youtubers (who are archived on the site) who have played that certain game. You will then be able to sort this list by play style and other things to better match you with the type of videos you enjoy.  

*Search/sort by genre.*  

You like FPS, Indie, Horror, etc? You can search by just a genre and will receive a list of games tagged with those. Click on a game title and you will be presented with a list of youtubers who have/are currently playing those games.  

  
**Each Youtuber member of the site will have their own page** where your social media links can be posted along with links to each episode on your channel. Each channel will also have a spot for your subscribers to give you input. There will be one of three sections to comment to. 1. Random: this will serve like the normal comment section of youtube where the viewers can comment whatever they want. 2. Requests: This will serve as a place where viewers can request what games they would like to see or any other requests. 3. Critique: Here the viewers will be able to give their criticism on how you can improve. The purpose of these different sections will be so that you (as the commentator) can more easily sift through the comments. I believe this feature will prove to be more beneficial as your channel begins to grow and start to receive too many comments to view them all.  


**Home page:** There will be a ""highlight reel"" that will play a 15 second clip of your channel that I will combine with other clips from members of the site. The total highlight reel will be 5 minutes total. I will post a new highlight reel twice a week so that new users that come to the site can see the best you guys have to offer. These 15 second clips can be funny, it will have your youtube channel name and episode number along with it so it would be easier for people to know who you are in such a short amount of time.  



**Main Benefit:** Will help small/new Youtube Commentators grow in size by concentrating all potential viewers in one place.  

The only places currently that commentators have to advertise are either on their own FB or Twitter, not gain new ones. That leaves forums which tend to have a very small niche market. Having a website like this that serves as a hub, I feel is the best way to gain exposure. If every member of the site adds a graphic, description, or briefly talks about the site, then they can help add potential viewers to the ""hub"".  

*Example:* ""Member #2354"" has only 50 subscribers. ""Member #4233"" has 200 subscribers. ""Member # 3424"" has 1000 subscribers. If each of them adds a plug for the site (during their videos or description)

Hopefully that makes sense. This idea will only work as long as all of you here advertise it because the more viewers that find their way to the site, the main problem each channel faces will no longer be the lack of exposure, but will be keeping the potential viewers entertained. Think about the amount of potential subscribers you can gain if this site would really gain in popularity. Doing it this way means that we will all grow together.

**Criteria for being on the site.**  
Well I thought that the best thing would be to add some sort of criteria in order to keep the website as active as possible. I think the only thing that a channel needs to have potential

I am sure that there are many more features that can enhance this type of website that I haven't thought about as well as some ideas that I may have forgotten to list here. So tell me what you guys think about this idea. Would it make a difference? Is there a website already out there that does this?

______________________________________

- **So

I’m a gamer. And I love to play games. It’s something I’ve always loved and will continue to love until the day I die.

- **Yeah

I’m an almost-22 non-graduate unemployed man who really hates the idea of working a dead-end 9-5 job for the rest of my life without anything else to give my life meaning. I don’t want to be a sound engineer. I don’t want to be a computer scientist. Hell, play video games on the internet, and have a hell of a time doing so. Because I fucking LOVE video games and I want to share that with anyone and everyone who wants to listen.

- **You and everyone else

Because I’m raw. And I don’t mean raw as in edgy or intentionally angry at everything all the time. I mean I don’t censor, I tell you what I think of it, simple. I play the games I want to play, and I enjoy the games I enjoy. There is no agenda other than mine... I don’t have time for that shit. I honestly don’t have what it takes to be someone that I’m not. I can’t imagine sitting there in front of a camera and putting on an act to appeal to more people. It leads down a path I have zero interest in. It’s take it or leave it; like it or don’t with me.

I am me. I am a gamer. I love playing games and I want to share that part of me with everyone else. 

- **You sound like a pretentious hipster fuck.** 

Yeah, I give up on this, and I move on. Thing is, I think that I am, at the very least, an interesting person when it comes to video games. Talk to me about something else, and I might be a little tight-lipped. Video games, this is my passion

And yeah

- **Yes

Watch me. Get to know me through the work I do. I can say that I’m a great person all day long

- **Okay Mr. Perfect

And therein lies the problem

Not a whole lot is the answer. A wise content producer once said to me that “who you are is unique

Then I thought of how bad I’d feel if I just gave up before I even tried. And I mean REALLY tried. I’ve done this before in spurts but I gave up before I even gave myself a chance to grow and get an audience. 

So fuck that. Fuck giving up because this is what I want to do.

What makes me a special goddamn snowflake? 

Me. I make me a special goddamn snowflake and a snowflake worth something. I’m not at that point right now, be the best me that I can be, and let my work speak for itself. Because I can do this. This is something I know, deep down, I can do. I just have to work at it.

- **So... WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU?!**

I’m Time Glitch. I’m a gamer, and I’m not going to flake out. Not anymore. It’s all or bust. I am going to be interesting. I am going to be insightful. I am going to produce high-quality content with a passion behind it.

I don’t do this for the views. I don’t do this for the popularity. I do this for me.

I shared this quote today on my facebook. Johnny Depp is one of my favorite actors so this is perfect for me. These words inspire me to move and never stop. I'll show you just how effective this mentality can be..

My highest viewed video is this: http://youtu.be/QqilYpOfx7Y 
My channel: https://youtube.com/user/MikieGames 

I made the video out of frustration..so I had a little fun and I didn't give a shit about what anyone thought. The video has mixed feedback. Some viewers love it..and others hate it. But how are you suppose to keep moving forward if you never take a chance and worry about criticism? 

This quote has pushed me to make more..surprising content that you don't see everywhere. You have to have thick skin to make videos. So the faster I felt this..the better I became. And the more fun I had. I keep this mentality in all my videos.

I am not saying don't care about what your viewers want or be cold. I appreciate every little view I have and constructive criticism.  But it is so important to do w/e you have to do..for YOU. Think about what or who YOU love. And I promise you..it will work.

Could someone who has some experience doing a LP give me a step by step guide

-OR-

Could someone point me in the direction of an IAmA that will go through all this? 

I have like no money but have a good laptop so purchasing a recording program isnt very feasable so freeware or super cheap programs are the best for me... I'm not too worried about production quality (that will get better as time goes and I get better at the whole process)

please help me I really wanna do this as it will keep me from going insane with this broken leg

Games I would like to do LP's with...

Resident Evils (starting from 1 all the way to 6)
Wrestling Games (preferably the older ones but maybe a few new ones)
Minecraft (of course who doesn't do a minecraft LP)
Old school Nes/Snes/Genesis others (probably on emulators to start off with until I learn how to do a ""from the tv recording""

**TL;DR I want to start doing LP's on my computer but have no idea where to start/what to do google isn't helping much and I cant find a good AMA to help out... can someone help introduce me into the LP brotherhood?**

1348080204.0,105ddo,How do you differentiate yourself as a Let's Player,Entr0p1c,12,2,17,"Hey guys

I spent the last week building a PC and trying to get it up and running and working out the tweeks. I was so excited to start LPing on it I managed to get an early copy of FTL and preordered Borderlands 2.

Unfortunately one of my RAM sticks was defective so I wasn't able to post videos until today. After everything was fixed I decided to make a video explaining why I hadn't posted videos over the last week and asking for suggestions as to what to play next (because I didn't have a gaming PC prior).
 
I also went on to list games that I had already picked up such as FTL

Within 10 minutes I was called a copy-cat of Northernlion. I watch NL and respect him a lot; he was the main reason I got into LPing. I know that a few (or most) of our games overlap but I figured it was more an overlapping of interests not copying.

It was a comment that cut me deep both because I respect NL and because I have been trying very hard to differentiate myself from other LPers.

So I guess my question is this: How do I differentiate myself from other LPers? Should I ignore this guy or does he have a point?

Is it because you want to see the whole game?
Is it because you find the commentary funny or the playing skilled?
Are you trying to learn something by watching?
Do you watch in hopes that I fail miserably at my task of completing it?

PlumpHelmetPunk - His storytelling abilities are almost out of this world. And he has some crazy whitty comments :P. He does not really edit too much either. Also find PHPs Dwarf Fortress LPs amazing

Sleepyjo2 - I am unsure as to why this person is one of my fav LPrs but maybe it is because he is just ur average Final Fantasy gamer ... and a friend ... but it really entertaining to watch and streams almost all of his recordings. Since he streams he doesnt really edit too much out either.

GrimithR - What can I say about Grimith other than INCREDIBLY funny. This man is without a doubt one of the funniest LPrs I watch atm. He is funny mainly due to the fact that he rages at himself so much or the game :P. He is also incredibly good at civ IV. I dont think Grimith edits too much either mainly due to the fact that he is ""lazy"" lol

1344850622.0,y4yu0,Tagging 101,Qieth,12,1,10,"**Introduction**

I wanted to write this little guide to help people produce better tags on videos. Why? Because tags matter

You might get a bunch of views from friends and family

**Why tags matter**

Tags is what Youtube use to figure out how people are going to find your videos. Tags will bring new audience to your video, and that means they are likely to check out your other videos as well.

It might be nice to get a few views from linking your video on Facebook

**Sexy girl bikini topless free money**

I keep using that word.. relevant. Why is that, you will have to find some tags that people are likely to search for if they are looking for the kind of videos you produce. Put yourself in their shoes: ""I want to find a Let's Play of Portal 2"". What are you going to search for? That's right: [Let's Play Portal 2](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Let%27s+Play+Portal+2&amp;oq=let%27s+play+portal)

If I'm out looking for a Let's Play of Alan Wake

Whats worse, hoping that someone will search for ""Minecraft"" and stumble upon your video.

Big mistake! Let's go back to that word.. relevant. Youtube will rank videos not only based on video views, then you will be rewarded with a higher ranking in the search history.

But if someone finds your Monkey Island video when they were searching for Minecraft, and leave the video. Youtube will notice that people don't stick around on your video, and then they will display other videos before yours. I am sure that people don't have to watch your full video (I upload 15-20 minute videos, and I get great search rankings), but my best guess is that you would want people to stick around for at least a couple of minutes.

Bonus: Add skip-annotations to later parts in your video and add links and annotations to other videos to keep people searching through your content.

**Making good tags**

Alright, which is quick to edit for whatever series you are using. I shall share this sacred knowledge with you here:

--x--

GAME NAME

""GAME NAME""

""let's play GAMENAME""

""GAMENAME walkthrough""

""GAMENAME gameplay""

""GAMENAME commentary""

""GAMENAME pc gameplay""

blind ""let's play"" lets play playthrough walkthrough ""video game"" tutorial

GENRE SPECIFIC TAGS (action, scary)

GAME SPECIFIC TAGS (writer darkness light guns shooting firearm ""episode 1"" nightmare)

--x--

Copy this, so my template obviously reflects this. Replace GAMENAME with the name of the game, and change GENRE/GAME SPECIFIC TAGS with something relevant to the video.

You might notice the two first lines:

*GAME NAME*
and
*""GAME NAME""*

Why does this matter? If you don't use quotation marks, then you need to do both so the words are considered tags both individually and as a whole.

Here is an example of the tags I used on a recent project of mine:

Quantum Conundrum ""Quantum Conundrum"" ""let's play Quantum Conundrum"" ""Quantum Conundrum walkthrough"" ""Quantum Conundrum gameplay"" ""Quantum Conundrum commentary"" ""Quantum Conundrum pc gameplay"" blind ""let's play"" lets play playthrough walkthrough ""video game"" tutorial puzzle portal dimension slow heavy fluffy ""Professor Q"" ""Airtight Games"" ""Square Enix"" ""Kim Swift"" Fitz Quadwrangle Steam ""Square Enix""

You get the picture

1374073040.0,1ihlt9,Let me tell you my tale...,BaqFish,10,1,14,"Hello Perfectionists

being an avid gamer for about 15 years I found myself not having too much time for video games once I got a job and had to manage my household. With what was left of the day remaining for gaming I appreciated it even more - the difference between being able to play 10 and 2 hours a day is quite significant.

Realizing how important gaming is in my life the logical step was to try to do something more professional with it. Having done multiple gaming related videos in the past

After working on my idea for a couple of weeks I had to admit that I had bitten off way more than I could chew within my timeframe - resulting in me dumping my initial idea. Several weeks past but the idea of doing something more professional stayed. 

As I follow the gaming scene regulary I knew a lot of ""Let's Plays"" and the, there was something to find, that would make my content different. 

For years I've enjoyed completing games to 100%, one of my all time favourites I knew I had a lot to say about the game, making it easier to start. My first video was released on the 17th April. 

Shortly after the first episodes there were more things I wanted to do

Now, resulting in an overall better feeling about the quality .

Being at 3 Subscribers and 201 Views I feel confident about my channel thus far. A new series ""Endless Tale..."" is in the making where I play games that have no ""real"" end - think about games like Faster Than Light

Now you might wonder why did I even make this post. The reason is that I fear that once my channel hits some rocks and won't progress I will only see the negative things going on. Thus this post will be some kind of a diary with (hopefully) monthly updates to keep me on track and keep myself motivated.

Hey

I'm 18

I knew Alex and Richard from school

One day, but solo recording was too difficult, and I found that the whole thing wasn't really for me. 

I told Alex about it, he had also been planning on doing something similar with a friend. After a while of prying, we decided I could be part of it, and the rest is history. 

My favorite games to play are games like GTA, and Haunting Ground. I prefer to play on emulators, because I really don't want to spend extra money on a capture card when ripping your own games onto you computer is free. :p

I never really did before

Hello

While I’m not as skilled as Zach in the editing/tech department

Video-games and entertaining people have always been a major interest of mine, you know? It's all about making something cool and sharing it with my friends and the internet.


The whole idea started one day while I was hanging with Richard

So, but I never really knew where to start. So, the idea for the channel had been floating around in our heads for a good while when I happened to talk to an old acquaintance of mine about it. 

Zach had shared a few laughs with us during those times at the lunch table

I think improving our wiki is the best way to improve r/Letsplay.  All kind of amazing information is scattered throughout this subreddit

1. It will help new people who can become lost in a maze asking the same questions over and over.  
2. It will make it so regulars and experienced LP'ers can focus on more detailed questions because there will be less time spent answering the same questions over and over again.
3. It will grow a wider base of knowledge about the technical aspects of Lets Playing
4. It will make /r/Letsplay the premier place for technical information about how to make let's plays.  Something which from my experience has either been behind a paywall (Something Awful) or in a community that didn't care about people they weren't friends with.
5. It will bring in other experienced LP'ers who currently don't come here because they don't think there is anything for them to gain


In direct response to Bubbleking87, but heck, this is a place to promote LP's.  Finding the appropriate line for shameless promotion is something the community needs to figure out, but unless someone wants to step up and moderate everything we just need to accept it.  I personally don't think our time should be spent on nit picking whether or not someone crossed the line with shameless promotion, but thats just my call, and I will go with the community on this one.  Finally, saying we need a litmus test for people to come to /r/Letsplay and ask for advice is appealing to filter people who pop in, and never show up again.  However I think denying people who haven't been here a while the opportunity to post freely will make us into an unfriendly place for new comers.  I don't want to see this subreddit become that.  I like it here because it is open to all people


My main point is that the best way to improve our community, or even day's we've been at this awesome hobby.

There are plenty of articles on the net on YouTube SEO (Search Engine Optimization) along with some helpful tips and tricks you can use to your advantage. below find a cheat sheet:  
* The name of the video before you upload **IS** important (Mov2236.avi is a **bad** thing to name that file)  
* Focus on one keyword or more realistically phrase per video.  
* don't name your videos ""Sunday sermon 4/28/2013""  
* Use YouTubes search feature to find popular keywords. if you start typing ""how to save"" and it offers the suggestion ""how to save my friends soul"" that is a popular keyword and will net you more views through search.  
* Your title, if you are trying to rank for a keyword that keyword or phrase should be in each of these places.  
* take the time to include a transcript of the video
* LINKBACKS this is the thing people always forget
* as some people point out video age is an important key however you can beat age with relevancy. I have beaten out older videos by using these methods and I'm sure that in time you can too.

**Mega Man Maverick Hunter X**[(Playlist Here)](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYQ_yRv1y_KwF5xWO5cdlVfg7yDsth7Dz)

A PSP game! Madness! Growing up I played more than my share of Mega Man X on the SNES and I really wanted to do a series on it however it's so overdone on Youtube I was hesitant. That's when I decided to hook my PSP up and play the remake! It's a great remake too with completely remade graphics, anime sequences, and they even added a playable character! Admittedly I'm not the greatest at MM games so those of you who enjoy me making a fool out of myself expect it more than usual!

1357973588.0,16fe9f,720p or 1080p? [PROTIP INSIDE],HomerSPC,11,1,17,"As requested [HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/16d9va/need_some_tips_on_compressing_and_making_files/c7v12za):


I always see people ask if they should upload as 720p, I'll give the simple answer.  Upload, render, etc. at 720p.  The reasons behind this statement is pretty simple:

1) The demographics of people who: a) have a internet speed fast enough for 1080i/p

(Addendum to b) Most actually watch 480p and never even go to 720p. 

2) 720p videos are smaller in filesize and upload faster.  I know for myself at least, that upload time will increase dramatically.

3) (Addendum to 1c) As said before, the difference between 720p and 1080p is very slight.  This is because of the pixel density in the screens.  It will appear VERY SLIGHTLY more sharp, but that's it.  Not many people do that.

4) The kicker: Most YouTubers have no idea how to properly export a 1080p video.  Many people try converting a video from 1080i into 1080p, guaranteed.  **If you ever have an i video, always downsize the resolution to p.  Never try to convert i to p in the same resolution**.


There is always those people who will upload 1080p, YouTube and internet speeds have not grown far enough to demand 1080p videos.  

Never fall into the trap of thinking your channel isn't getting attention because of your video quality.  Only a few years ago did the internet only consist of 360p/480p videos.  The thing which set them apart was audio quality.  A video can be very visually unappealing

I know how a lot of you feel about Minecraft

There's been a lot of talk lately about working with others to increase your views/subs as well as just having a good time. I run a small tight-knit LP server with about 9 of us (4 or 5 who are very active)

Even though we all revolve around Minecraft

The server itself is running the latest version of vanilla Minecraft. It's a real server sitting in my data center in NYC (not just an old Packard Bell I have laying around the house). We don't have any age requirements, we expect you to respect other peoples builds and keep mindful of when people are recording (as not to ruin their videos).

The players range in age from about 14 (there's about two or 3 people under the age of 18) to 33, but we all make it a point to keep in contact (we have a Skype group), and are always there for each other when we need someone to play with.

If this is something you are interested in

Like I said, we expect everyone who wants to join to already have a YouTube account and some videos (doesn't have to be Minecraft) up that we could watch and get a feeling for you. None of us have a really large amount of subs (we range from a couple dozen subs, to a couple hundred. No one has over 500), but we are all dedicated LPers. We will not base our decision on accepting you or not by your sub or view count. So if you are completely new to LPs, just make a YouTube account, and upload a quick video. That will allow us to not only check out your personality, but also your recording quality.

I've been wanting to start doing an LP for a long while now

I'm not sure if it's because I watch a lot of LP's and know deep down in the back of my mind that mine won't be anywhere near their quality for a long time or what, edit it, and actually get it up on YouTube. 

I've recorded a couple of different sessions so far and have ended up scrapping them because I found my commentary/gameplay boring and/or the settings were done incorrectly.

1. At the moment, so I became curious about how to make a good let's play channel, like so many others on this subreddit. So I decided to join Reddit to get some advice. I've always found it interesting, looking at the first videos of popular let's play channels. Sometimes the audio is horrible, or the video is just someone pointing a camera at a screen, yet somehow people stick around. Just wanted to know what others' opinions are on the ""redeeming qualities of a let's play"". For example, if the video quality is horrible, would you stick around? Why are some let's plays that are just people talking over the cutscenes, super popular these days?

2. I've always been super uncomfortable with my voice (which is super manly, not just write things like ""sub 4 sub!!?1!"". I can't livestream due to a horrible upload speed of about 0.60 mbps (0.70 on a good day), so youtube uploads have been my focus. I've semi-gotten over my voice, and just decided to dive headfirst into a bunch of games with the hope that people could share the same interest and opinions on these games, but all I've gotten are sub 4 sub channels. How do you go about finding people without spamming the hell out of other channels?

In the blog article

[At least a few people](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/z4zag/til_that_in_1962_american_scientists_detonated_an/c61l22u) that went to the video page were confused by something in the bottom right of the description: ""contains content from tseriesbhakti"". I'm sure most of you are familiar with what that means, and that YouTube allowed it.

[Tseriesbhakti](http://www.youtube.com/user/tseriesbhakti) is an Indian music artist. This is a video of declassified US nuclear tests. Fishy

To confirm what everyone was thinking, technically. However, **there's nothing talkingsticktv can do to get the claim off the video.**

Talkingsticktv uploads a lot of public domain footage, and **received a strike against their account.** This is completely unacceptable. If I host content on my channel, I want to be able to control that content. I don't want a large YouTube network partner coming in and taking a proverbial crap on my front lawn, and when the police show up, they hand *me* a ticket.

**TL;DR:**

* talkingsticktv uploaded a public domain video to their channel
* It made it to Reddit front page
* tseriesbhakti claimed copyright on the public domain video that is hosted on talkingsticktv
* tseriesbhakti is currently getting all of the ad revenue from that video

This would be our first lets play ever so we're new to the whole thing but ready to jump right in.

Here comes the advice-needing part. Now, but my first LP is a Pokemon game. The reason for that being that I want to do something of a beta-test LP. I know Crystal pretty well and I have the editing knowledge to make it less boring than you might expect. My influence in my editing style is pretty obvious, and I'm already super worried about being called a ""chugga"" copycat. That's where you all come in...sort of. I'm not coming on reddit to ask you to create my identity, but I want to hear other people's experiences with being compared to popular LPers (negatively or positively).

I've only posted two videos and I've only had my channel for two days, I'm a nervous wreck in my two videos). To be clear, I'm not one of those ""pokemans"" kids who is only ever going to LP pokemon games. I'm not trying to build my fanbase around this LP, but I want to do the best I can. If you think I can make my Crystal LP more funny/entertaining/informative, definitely give me your opinion. However, bear in mind that I'm committed to the LP and I'm planning on being very diverse in the games/genres that I delve into.

So, tips on audio mixing and gear are VERY welcomed. I'm using a webcam mic right now, but I do plan to get something better.

**Original**: Hi everyone

What we'll be giving away

**Steam Titles**

You can grab our deep space strategy title [AI War](http://store.steampowered.com/app/40400) and any/all of its DLC for 75% off through December 31st (even more savings if you go with the Alien Bundle which is everything together.) Not only that but it has a featured achievement Steam users can unlock to earn and win more stuff through the current [The Great Gift Pile treasure hunt event](http://store.steampowered.com/holidaysale) running in conjunction with the huge sale.

Our unique puzzler [Tidalis](http://store.steampowered.com/app/40420/) is 80% off on Steam as well. If you're into deep block-based puzzling (note: not match-3) for $2 instead of $10

**Non-Steam Titles**

Our in-development sprawling 2D sidescroller [A Valley Without Wind](http://www.arcengames.com/w/index.php/avww-buy) is available for pre-order now through our site at 50% off the launch price (at the moment it's $10 as opposed to $20.)  You can also grab it on MacGamesStore, but if/when it does arrive the licence key you'll receive will work to activate the game on Valve's client.


If you'd like to try any of these games you can find the AI War demo [here](http://www.arcengames.com/w/index.php/aiwar-downloads), though I believe that those are just the PC versions.

How you can participate in the giveaway:


Per request I'll be giving out the keys by asking in the comments for a number between such and such, figure out the winners, and deliver the licence keys to their inboxes.


We'll be adding extra keys to the drawing as we reach various milestones in upvotes, as this post accumulates more points and entries, I'll add in extra keys and draw additional winners for them accordingly.


If you do end up picking up [AI War](http://reddit.com/r/aiwar) or [A Valley Without Wind](http://reddit.com/r/avww) during the sale/giveaway


Thanks everyone and best of luck! Happy Holidays. :D

Love

**Edit**: An amendment to the rules above as wisely suggested by Reddit user cyantist. The reasoning is good enough for me:

*I want to encourage you to run the random number generator until you get a hit, 15 for a chance to win AI War, why then should 14 get a 1/81 chance of winning and 13 and 15 have more than that?*

*Why should people who post later get better chances? (Due to the fact that they can choose numbers relative to those who have already posted.)*",self,t5_2qss1,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/nl9ht/hi_rletsplay_we_arcen_games_are_running_a_few/

1376430820.0,1kb2n5,3% of views are from subscribers? I'm not sure what we're doing wrong.,sebastiansb,8,0,27,"I've been trying to figure out what's going on with my channel for a while now and figured I'd ask how things are going with other people's channels.  According to Youtube Analytics 3% of my channel's views come from subscribers.  The tiny size of this figure is admittedly somewhat exaggerated because we have a Saints Row The Third video that is coming up on 300k views

http://img823.imageshack.us/img823/1972/klei.png

I accept that only a portion of subscribers watch each video.  This can easily be observed by the fact that Game Grumps and PewDiePie videos rarely get as many views as those channels have subscribers.  I understand that I shouldn't expect every video to reach 1k with our current subscriber count.  My concern comes from the fact that our view counts fall well below estimations I've seen reported in this subreddit and elsewhere.  One of the most common figures I've seen is that videos often get views around 10% of your subscribers count

What confuses me is that we get several emails per day saying that we have new subscribers coming in.  I could understand if we had a bunch of inactive subscribers that have lost interest and perhaps aren't youtube regulars any more

Grasping at straws

1) Perhaps we're only being subscribed to by other let's play channels?  I know it's common practice to spam subscriptions all over the place with the hope that those people will subscribe back.  I believed this more when everyone had usernames

2) Is the new YouTube layout killing our channel's exposure to our new audience?  I use this awesome grid layout to keep track of my subscriptions that can be found at https://www.youtube.com/my_subscriptions?feature=mhee but as far as I can tell this link has been removed from the YouTube interface.  I suppose that instead of a functional subscription menu YouTube wants users to stick with the awful facebook-style feed over at https://www.youtube.com/feed/subscriptions or the homepage that buries most of your subscriptions down below the ""recommended for you"" section.

That's all I really have.  Before anyone says ""you shouldn't be doing it for the views"" I want to say that's already the case.  If we weren't doing this for fun we would have quit a long time ago because it's actually a lot of work to put out as much content as we have over the last year and a half.  This is just a nagging issue that we don't understand and is kind of bothering us.  We have a small group of seemingly loyal fans that keep telling us that we deserve more views

Many of my new subscribers have been leaving comments on videos and engaging in conversation, and is one reason why I'm going to switch some of my budget around to spend $5-$10/day on Adwords for the next few weeks, as long as I can keep my CPV down to around 0.01.

It seems like whenever someone mentions on a forum, that they want to increase views/subscribers/traffic on their channel they are bombarded by comments that say, ""Let's Playing is just for fun. Views don't matter. If you care about views/money then you aren't having enough fun.""

I agree with a few things here. Views should not be your primary focus nor should subscribers or money or anything along those lines. Hell

BUT I do not believe that wanting more people to see the thing you put insane amounts of work into is wrong. I think it's actually a very good thing. When people say things like ""You obviously aren't having fun and you only care about views and money."" Then it's actually quite discouraging to people who work hard at what they do PLUS it doesn't even answer the damn question.

Also

All I'm trying to say is that wanting to gain viewership is a good thing. It shows that you want people to see what you love doing.

1374014780.0,1ig2rd,[Update] 21 days later,Byronyk,10,0,9,"I started my first [**YouTube channel**](http://www.youtube.com/user/TheByronyk) 21 days ago on June 25th. Since then, so here it is.

**Setup**
Before I started uploading my first video, and upload videos that worked for me. I use Dxtory for my video and audio recording and use Vegas Pro 12 for video editing and rendering. In the future, I intend on picking up a blue yeti for voice recording as I've heard they produce great quality for the price.

**Commentating/personality**
When I first started out, I was able to overcome that nervousness and be myself. 

I feel the main reason people watch LPs is the personality of the commentator. As such

**Game Choice**
I play games I enjoy playing. I don't record videos of games that are popular or trending unless I am interested in them. For example, there are a few indie games coming out that are far less popular that I look forward to playing! Don't cheat yourself -- play what you want!

**Conclusion**
A big reason why I'm loving and enjoying my LPs is /r/Letsplay. You guys are awesome and have given me a ton of information that I've (hopefully) put to good use! I hope to be as helpful to the /r/Letsplay community as you have been now that I have some experience under my belt. I might be doing a 3 month update in the future,,False,self,t5_2qss1,False,,True

*-pop filter 15USD

*-23 inch 1080p monitor 180USD

*-3TB external harddrive 120USD


It is a slippery slope lol. I got a 2nd harddrive because one was used for games and one was used for writing. I got a mic/pop filter because my headset quality was not too fantastic. I got a 1080p monitor so I can play at 1080p and have less problems with resolution (eww black bars). I got a 3TB external harddrive because I realize that 1080p made my raws 2x larger and I need storage of my completed works.

I started LPing in late Jan/early Feb. I must've spent 600USD on hardware. 

It is kinda fun LPing with my dog. My dog helps me in not freaking out. I have social anxiety and scared of talking vocally. My dog, but I pretend that I am talking to her lol.

LPing actually makes me want to go and buy new games. Back then

How this works is the person below you looks at a considerable number of your videos from beginning to end (for example we'll say 5). When they have finished watching they will make a little report in general terms of:

5 things they liked
5 things they disliked
5 things you could improve on etc

when this report is posted and everyone is happy then the person who was in 3rd does the same for the person who was in 2nd. In this way as we work our way down through the list everyone will have to give comprehensive feedback of anothers channel before they themselves get feedback on theirs

1363048848.0,1a48ag,Copyright claims (Related to Tomb Raider),NiallJR,8,0,17,"*Sigh*

This is really disappointing but I've learnt a hard lesson about YouTube today. Little guys get screwed. Little guys get screwed and cannot do anything about it.

So

I wasn't worried

And today I log in to YouTube ready to see how my latest part is doing only to get a condescenging lesson on copyright from the Happy fucking Tree Friends.. Wait

Remember the second part claimed by GoDigital for 'Akaro (Female Vocals)' welp that's turned into a full blown COPYRIGHT STRIKE. The absolute nightmare situation for any hopeful Let's Player. At this point

Then as you'll see in the screenshot I'm left with a final option of logging a counter-notification claim which can lead to FULL LEGAL ACTION.

I decide what the hell and look at the form. You're only given 2 character limited boxes to explain yourself and the rest of the form is basically where you put in all your information but still know nothing about the company that could potentially sue you. I decide to go ahead with it anyway. The way I see it if I can't upload more than 15 minute videos my channel is finished anyway.

So.. the counter-notification claim is pending. God knows what happens next and the two other disputes are still being processed.

I've since made the entire playlist private and seen that other people have completely deleted their Tomb Raider videos.

I'm mainly making this post to let others know that if you are in the process of disputing a claim just give up now and delete the videos. If you're not partnered or Pewdiepie sized you're essentially screwed.

I don't have much hope for my claim or my channel at this point and it's really disheartening to see that YouTube have such a shitty screening process for copyright claims. Literally anyone can claim copyright on anything and you don't have to prove it unless it gets to court but of course no one wants to go that far out of fear or not wanting to spend money on legal proceedings.

I picked FTL as my first game because 1.) It's awesome and 2.) It is one of the few Steam games I have that doesn't take 20+ hours to beat that I am actually decent at.

As this is my first LP, well... That's just my natural way of speaking so that will take some more effort. Also I didn't really explain how the game works, which I didn't even notice as I was recording. Do you think that this is something that is necessary in a Let's Play? And would doing it in video 2 or 3 be to late to explain the game mechanics?

So I've wanted to a Mirror's Edge a while ago but I wasn't sure how to present it. Definitely not going to just talk about what I'm doing constantly because something is always happening. Definitely not going to do it as a speed run either.

So I decide it to play the game like you are watching from Faith's eyes as she is going through the level for the first time.  With the occasionally bit of commentary to highlight a little something here and there.

Maybe it works.  Maybe it doesn't.  I'd like your opinion either way. Also

I noticed how a lot of people are asking for feedback (Including myself) but not a lot of people offer feedback to begin with. With that in mind I decided to help some people out by sharing my opinion towards their videos. This way maybe I'll find someone that I enjoy watching and maybe you'll also get a new subscriber here and there on top of that.

I will try to do this once per week if I can keep up. Like I said in the title

Alright so leave a comment with your channel and a short description about your goal and how you started then add one of your videos and I'll reply as soon as I check it out. Keep in mind that I will give feedback as a random viewer that just found one of your videos randomly. As long as you can take criticism in a mannered way and use it to help you out in the end


EDIT: Just wanted to let you know that for some reason a lot of comments (including mines) have disappeared so I can't check some of them. Hopefully it will get fixed soon. I'll check out the ones that I can see. Cheers!

What do people think of having the face cam in non-scary games? 

I know the typical first reaction is that they are pointless and bad and omg why would you do that. Is that really the case

For example

I also feel like having the face there could probably get the viewer to relate to the LPer a little bit more. And really that's what it's all about. A good LP is about a likable character behind it. Maybe it's easier to connect to a face than a voice?

1345587944.0,ylrnl,Is YouTube really the best way to go?,Saigancat,8,1,12,"I started doing LPs about a year ago as a means to force myself into a hobby after my marriage fell apart. I hadn't been happy in a long time because I was putting the image of a responsible father and husband first. I gave up most of the things I enjoyed and it backfired with misery. After the split I tried looking back at the things I wanted to do before and the things that had made me happy- a back to basics strategy. I returned to gaming a little bit each day

The experience was enjoyable and the LP community is largely positive and helpful and I've met a lot of people with similar tastes in gaming. Somewhere along the line I applied for an AdSense account after seeing many popular LPers like HCBailey and Kenshin were also running ads. I also familiarized myself with ""Fair Use"" as it pertains to copyright laws.

For a while nothing changed,000. My AdSense account started inflating thanks to all the additional views I was getting.

I could see a future really getting into Gaming Culture, and an escape from my job (which is actually a really good job but not what I want).

This morning I was greeted with an email from Google notifying me my account has been disabled. Here is the portion of the email which does not directly include account information.

Quest 64 ([playlist](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4150AE410F0FD91A&amp;feature=view_all))
  
I tend to focus almost exclusively on older games, lesser known etc. I update the ""main"" series (currently Arc the Lad II) daily unless some issue arises.  
  
In the past I have done a ""when I can"" side project (usually meaning every other day) but after Quest 64 I'm probably going to stick to one game at a time. I'm going to school currently to study game design

I have received a recent invitation to the D3 beta and have just recently started an LP showing off the Witch Doctor class since I have not played that class yet. I plan to show more classes once I'm done with the Witch Doctor (doesn't take very long to get through the beta) and hope you'll enjoy them.

Titles are so important and so many people forget about them.

Keep in mind

* intro video/picture (if you make one
* wrong/uninformative/""ugly"" titles/thumbnails
* ""forced"" acting (acting itself can be okay

I just finished my first ever [Let's Play of Don't Starve](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHBcemKOV_HZ-FTcKxyRWtuIG0kgw-5fd) which ran for 43 episodes and was a lot of fun. I worked through a lot of kinks in learning the ropes of video making and am very excited to start fresh with a new series. 

The first episode of my [Shadowrun Returns LP](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxrmhbSIvMo) came out today and I'd love some feedback on it. New episodes will be 3x a week on Mon/Wed/Fri. I also do Wow Pet Battle content every Tuesday and First Impressions of games on Thursdays if you're into that kind of thing.

I am, but I focus on the wonderful blocky game.

Not too long ago, uploading it to Youtube and being done. I felt like there wasn't much sense to it.

So I decided to start a new world (utilizing the ""UHC mode"" = no natural health regeneration) in which I would play for myself

Every week or every two weeks I take all the recorded footage

I also add some post commentary parts to lead the viewer through the video

Since MUSIC IS VERY IMPORTANT for video (and in general) in my opinion

And here is the result; THE FIRST EPISODE:
http://youtu.be/L24bLeRHT8w


I enjoy these kind of Let's Plays myself

I like relaxed videos. Does that lead to a LACK OF ENTHUSIASM &amp; makes the video less interesting? Tell me your opinion!

(Also, though, and hope that this is not an issue.)

When I was done editing the first episode, though? BE HONEST!

___


TL/DR:

Lost interest in producing ""ordinary"" MC Let's Play.
Started new world &amp; series which is more heavily edited, a bit of a ""storyline"", trying to go for relaxed videos.

When you start out at anything. You will most likely not be very good. So take the constructive (or not constructive) criticism for what it is. Don't beat yourself up

Same thing applies if you already posted/uploaded videos and they liked it. Don't put expectations on yourself (They liked me when I was FUNNY, SAID THAT, etc). None of that shit matters now. It's a new video. Just play the game.  Clear your mind, and go with the gameplay. If they liked you before. Just be how you are (however you are).

This is just a bit of info that I am learning from my very limited time of LPing.

I have some ideas for features (if this idea ever comes to fruition that is) so hear me out:
***
- **The daily top 5 videos** 

yesterday's top 5 videos on the subreddit are posted to the channel individually

***
- **Exclusive content** 

the channel will hold the right to commission exclusive content from users, additionally the channel will be open to submission of unique material from users via drop box or some other application and will be reviewed by the previously mentioned panel of judges.
***
- **Play Dates**

Personally I am excited about this prospect

1. The time

2. The game and what platform

2. Who will and who will not be recording

3. [OPTIONAL] if there are too many to fit into one game, for example: (TF2) group A will be playing TDM while group B will be playing man vs machine and so on.

4. After the play date those who were recording will upload their footage to drop box

***

- **Payment**

This is an awkward thing to talk about but my idea for this is that each user will get 75% of the revenue of each video they make, but, this is not an incentive to post bad quality content, if the user submits videos with dislikes dominating above 60% of the video 3 times in a row then they will be flagged and intervened and taken off the payroll, they will still get their share of money for that week, but next week they will be reverted back to square one.

- **Partnerships**

Technically speaking anyone who gets their video onto the channel is a partner, or spinning a profit, it is about helping users find their audience and getting some exposure, that is the main aim of this channel.

***

- **Judges**

There will be 5 judges, each judge will vote yes or no on a video and this will decide if the video is worth uploading, but the majority vote takes the cake so remember 3 no's and 2 yeses does not mean yes.

Also to avoid bias and strain on the judges

To become a judge people merely need to opt in and they will be fed videos when its their turn.

Don't know about you but I don't enjoy typing 9000 characters

Anyone have efficient methods of putting in video tags? I've tried using a word document and putting all the tags in

I am kind of conflicted on what to do during cutscenes

1) Shut up and say nothing during the cutscenes? Although

2) Do you make ""small talk"" or respond to the cut scene? 
Ex: 
Woman - ""I am sorry about everything. It is all my fault."" 
Me -""We can make up. Kissy Kissy.""
Less intrusive to the cutscene. Does not provide or enhance the story/game. Just trying to be funny or reactive.

3) Do you try to make sense of the cutscene and reiterate what an NPC says?
Ex:
NPC - ""Okay
Me - ""I think everyone is all dead on that ship and most of our current party is going to die like red shirts""
Although

After my recent (and reasonably successful) completion of Let’s Play Resident Evil 2

[Episode 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaijYwgbYBc)- Am I as scared as when I started RE2? More importantly- can I get the controls right this time?

[Episode 2]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=webZOSJ1bZU)- attacked by plenty of villagers and the scary chainsaw guy. Very traumatising.

[Episode 3]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQm-4pcpiRE)- We make ‘Leon sandwiches’!

[Episode 4]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3dREuwy3g0)- We meet the merchant for the first time before I get ambushed once again.

[Episode 5]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lt83BSE7msY)- ‘The Trouble with Lagging’ special!

[Episode 6]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHmXT59nmT0)- Chainsaw man comes after me again

[Episode 7]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHmXT59nmT0)- We head off into the cemetery...

[Episode 8]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X2kQREbSmc)- I explain what I had to sacrifice in order to stop the emulator lagging...

[Episode 9](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf_qrTIFdvU)- We face-off with Del Lago

Pretty straight forward- I have a Twitch account and I am proposing the idea of doing a big stream, it's okay- the stream will most likely still be running later on for you to jump in on.

Games would ideally be stuff we can all go multiplayer on, Left 4 Dead 2 and others. Over that, we'd be on Skype chatting over it.

To get people over there watching, HE's there? I'll tag along and watch for him'. Of course then, people won't just be seeing you, they'll be seeing other Let's Players that they might find entertaining. That AND we'll all get to work with each other on something that we can look back on. 

I'd be looking to do it fairly soon. Not sure what the response you'll all have will be

**AUDIO**

* I have an M-Audio Producer USB mic with no pop filter. Will I need one for this mic

* I will be using [""Action!""](http://mirillis.com/en/products/action.html) for screen capturing. Is the audio on here good enough

**VIDEO** 

* As I mentioned earlier, etc.)

* Do you typically use a facecam when recording? Why/why not? I'm comfortable with using a facecam

**EDITING**

* I'll be using Premiere Pro CS5 to edit my videos. I don't have experience with it (I'll be using my father's copy that he already owns)

**GENERAL QUESTIONS**

* What are some ways that I can improve the quality of my videos quickly? I realize that I'm not going to immediately be as talented as some bigger names (i.e. PewdiePie or Syndicate)

* What are some good ways to increase my audience? I don't want to pull an ""IcyXlau"" (there was a bit of... let's call it ""controversy""... surrounding him as there were hundreds of spam Happy Wheels levels and YouTube comments promoting him)

* Is it worth trying to get partnered with a network (i.e. Machinima)? What effects does this have on viewers/subs? 

* Related to the last question: What would be a good network to try to get partnered with (once possible)?

I figure the help to the LP community is two-folds: First, more importantly, you'll see which games are on sale, and thus, more people will be looking up videos for. If you can't decide on the next LP, you can always just look for a new bundle, buy it for a dollar
