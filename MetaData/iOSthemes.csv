###About
___
&gt;The [Minimal MIUI Go Apex Theme](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.go.launcherex.theme.kxnt.miui&amp;hl=en) is currently developed and maintained for the Android OS by /u/Kxnt. With his permission, please **support the author** and [buy the theme](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.go.launcherex.theme.kxnt.miui&amp;hl=en) from the Google Play store. Although it's for Android, you can still use the resources to port over additional icons to iOS for your own personal use (plus, you get that warm and fuzzy feeling for doing the right thing).

###Installation
---
&gt;I've packaged the theme and put it on my personal repository. This is a /r/iOSthemes exclusive

###Comments
---
&gt;If after [buying the original theme](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.go.launcherex.theme.kxnt.miui&amp;hl=en) to support the author you're still feeling generous

In this update not only did I include new icons (**over 200!**) but I’ve changed the way FlatIcons works to be more efficient
Both FlatIconsSquaredLarge and FlatIconsSquared are now modification themes. This means that “FlatIcons” should ALWAYS be enabled. “FlatIconsSquared” or “FlatIconsSquaredLarge” should then be activated above it if desired
This change was implemented to save file space and remove redundant files.

**FlatAuxo is here!** Now you get a flattened Auxo theme with FlatIcons. Just choose to enable either “FlatAuxo” or “FlatAuxoDark” in Winterboard

**Introducing FlatWeather!** When enabled, and siri, as well as flattening the ENTIRE stock weather app!

There's lots of changes

Edit: If anyone notices icons that are supposed to be themed but aren't working

Here's a couple screenshots of the additions:

There are probably a few ways to do this
I also changed the qr background color value in the info.plist to be #ffffff01 but I'm not sure if that was necessary. I left the text entry field opaque for the sake of readability, I don't think this looks that great in most instances--it's nice on a plain background, but on your homescreen or anything else with a busy background it will get pretty hard to read.

First off

I've been working hard to get this ready for release

Also, featuring square icons.

Here's a small album of sample screenshots

And now for the bad news - for this icon theme to really shine, with request fulfillment and frequent updates.

This in itself isn't terrible news

I could release it as a free set, as I wouldn't get the necessary exposure, and I have no programming skills to keep it functioning properly.

If anyone has any suggestions as to how I can make this work

Check out the video here:
http://vimeo.com/64430875

We've added new clocks and weather icons

The app is a beautiful way to set up Peekly. You can change all the settings

Peekly (the lockscreen) as always will remain free (full featured). You can still control Peekly with the settings.js file.

The app however will cost a buck ($0.99). Please support devs as we spend a lot of time building these cool toys for you

Peekly and the app will be available from Cydia soon. If you are interested in beta testing please PM me.

I might also help with LockScreen themes, Phone Dialer/Calculator/Calendar/etc. themes, but that's a different episode...

**Step by step guide:**

Tools you'll need:

*On your computer:* Phoshop/Gimp/Pixlr
*On your iDevice:* iFile

**Creating the theme folder heirarchy**
Make a folder on your desktop or in your work folder named ##.theme (where ## is whatever you want it to show up as in winterboard.) Inside that folder

**Find app identifiers and icon names**
The easiest way to do this is to use Icon Thief. It automatically makes a zip with all the icons for all your apps in it

Use SBSettings or Appinfo to find the app folder for each app. Use iFile to look in that folder and navigate to its [appnamegoeshere].app folder; from here look inside that folder for info.plist - View it in a text viewer to find the app identifier (looks like com.developer.appname) - Next, and copy them over to your computer, inside a folder with the same name as the app identifier for the app [com.developer.app] - Put these app identifier folders inside the Bundles folder you created earlier.

*[Icon Sizes: 144x144, 72x72, 58x58, 57x57, 50x50, 40x40, 29x29 (For system icons, 118x120

If you want to theme the icons for jailbreak tweaks that only appear in your settings app

**Creating your icons**
Go into your bundle identifier folders and look at the sizes of icons that you have to make, some are Icon-50.png - *Make sure you have them all **exactly** right*)

*[Make sure that your icons' logos are uniform in the amount of space that they take up. If you're planning on keeping the stock iOS icon shape and size, as iOS will round the corners off. If you're planning on changing the shape/size of the icons, make sure to read the part about transparencies coming up.]*

**Transparencies/Masks**
If a theme has transparent areas around the icons

You will also need to do this with about 10 other images. Look in /System/Library/Private Frameworks/Mobile Icons.framework and get the names of the images with shadow/mask/outline/overlay in them. You'll want to make blank files for all of them and put them in that folder you made.

Do the same with the images in System/Library/Core Services/SpringBoard.app that have shadow/outline/mask/overlay in the title (unless they have 'folder' in the title. That will make your folder icons invisible if you do that.) Put all these blank files that you properly renamed into a folder named com.apple.springboard

*[Mask files determine the shape of the icons

If you want to change the shape or size of the icons (like 266 or MIUI do) you'll need each of these images to be edited so that only the shape/size you want are filled out. For the Mask files

**File transfer**
You can either use an SSH tool like Cyberduck or WinSCP to move your theme

If using SSH

If using Total Commander with TPOT

Move the ##.theme folder you've been working out of into your phone and place it in Library/Themes

Enable it in Winterboard and you should be good. But be prepared to troubleshoot missing icons or black squares around the icons if you made them transparent.

This whole process should take about 1-3 days of work if you're porting an already existing icon set, and how many icons you plan on making. (Trouble shooting will add quite a bit of time to that, as well.)

I love this theme, seeing as how 6.1.3 is now out.

**Here's the Fix**
Thanks to /u/locrawl.

&gt;OMFG I FIXED IT -- PLEASE READ!!!!!
After submitting a few logs to saurik
&gt;&gt;The one thing that ThemeReady seemed to be screwing with was the clock font, or maybe the font itself was copied incorrectly and ended up being deleted or otherwise corrupted. If others have this issue they may try replacing /System/Library/Fonts/Cache/LockClock.ttf (although maybe it is then hard to rebuild the metadata files).

I didn't find the font in the cache
    
    var/mobile/Library/BytaFont/Backup/LockClock.tff
Holy Shit. There it was. I copied it into
    
    /System/Library/Fonts/Cache/
as per saurik's suggestion
TL;DR - Copy LockClock.tff from var/mobile/Library/BytaFont/Backup/ into /System/Library/Fonts/Cache/. Just in case you don't have the font

**POSSIBLE WORKAROUND**

&gt; [Custom Battery](http://i.imgur.com/O8i5v9B.png)

About:
&gt; Allows for custom 1% battery images, I'd love to include it when I finally release this publically on Cydia (for free, of course).

How:
&gt; Simply create an image for each battery percentage (100-0), `WhiteOnBlackEtch_BatteryLevel_1@2x.png`). Then, using Winterboard, place them in a custom theme with the bundle `com.apple.UIKit` (eg. `/Library/Themes/Your CustomBattery Theme.theme/Bundles/com.apple.UIKit`)

Install
&gt; Add the following repo: `http://repo.fortysixandtwo.com/` and install the package `CustomBattery`. That's it! There are no settings to configure.

Notes
&gt; Please keep in mind that this tweak is BETA. So, but just in case! Also, this tweak will *automatically* hide the default iOS battery and battery percentage from your status bar. I plan to add a toggle for this later. 

Thanks

Basically

Now

**Edit:** I'm thinking about a prize, although obviously that isn't very much of a material reward.

Also

* How would people feel about others who enter in old submissions? Would it become a ""Hey, but what about those who made posts prior to a competition?
* Would this sort of thing lower the number of people submitting awesome and original content to /r/iOSthemes (the last thing we want) in the hopes of saving something very cool for the competition? (I'd imagine if the prize were just flair
* Would this have lasting popularity (eg enough to last for over a year)? When I held Tweak Madness

**Edit 2:** Nobody has addressed my biggest concern:

**Would you be ok with receiving flair as a prize? Or do you want something more material? It's ok to be greedy and say you'd rather receive a free theme/tweak/app. The community's choice will decide whether this becomes a monthly/once every two months competition (where winners receive flair) or a biyearly competition (where winners receive a theme/tweak/app).**

##About  
I've spent the past week or so working on this theme, widgets, etc. I posted a preview [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/iOSthemes/comments/1anae7/work_in_progress_my_windows_phone_theme/) and it was greeted with kind words. After about a weeks worth of work, I've grown fairly satisfied with it. Of course, there is *much* room for improvement. There are only about 20 icons, even on my own phone not everything is themed, as you can see in the screenshots above. I've been slowly working on getting the actual UI themed, what's there is there. I don't think I'll be working on it much more after this release

Now
_______________________________

##Warning  
This theme is **not** plug-and-play
Retina devices only! iPhone 5 is untested and likely unsupported.  
I had to go through a full restore while making this theme
If you aren't sure about a step
  
##Requirements:  

- Iconoclasm  
- PerPageHTML  
- Springtomize 2  
- An SSH Client [[WinSCP](http://winscp.net/eng/download.php) | [PuTTY](http://www.putty.org/) | [RBrowser](http://www.rbrowser.com/)]  


If you want to customize things to fit your liking:  

- [GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/downloads/)  
- [Iconoclasm Layout Builder](http://modmyi.com/forums/os-apps-development/702480-iconoclasm-layout-builder.html)  

  
##Installation  
______________

In order to get the *exact* same layout and theme that I currently have
**Note:** Do not enable any themes in Winterboard until step 17.  

1. Download the theme from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/6hebfezafcwcqwn/wPhone.zip)  
Extract it to a folder
    1\. *LargePages*: PerPageHTML backgrounds for the large tiles  
    2\. *Iconoclasm Layouts*: A large variety of icon layouts for large tiles and banners  
    3\. *WP8 Blank Icons.theme*: Invisible icons for overlaying large tiles  
    4\. *WP8 Icons.theme*: Themed icons  
    5\. *WP8 UI.theme*: Theming for UI elements [todo]  
    6\. *WP8 Widget.theme*: Bottom clock widget (optional)  
    7\. *WP8 ClearLock.theme*: A lockscreen with all clear elements
    8\. *Sloth Flow.theme*: A sweet lock-screen theme that has nothing to do with wPhone  
3. SSH into your phone using whatever client you prefer
4. Place the "".theme"" folders into /var/stash/Themes/
5. Place the Iconoclasm .plist files in /Library/Iconoclasm/Layouts
6. Place the folders in *LargePages* in /var/mobile/Library/PerPageHTML
6. Go to Settings-&gt;Iconoclasm-&gt;Per Page Layouts-&gt;Enable
7. Set Page 1 to ""WP8 2 Left 1 MRight""  
8. Set Page 2 to ""WP8 1 BLeft 2 Right""  
9. Set Page 3 to ""WP8 MLBanner 1 BLeft""  
10. Set Page 4 to ""WP8 MRBanner 1 TRight""  
11. Set Page 5 to ""WP8 Left 1 MRight""  
11. Set Page 6 to ""WP8 MLBanner""
12. Set the rest of the pages to ""WP8 All Small Tiles."" Here's an [image reference](http://i.imgur.com/oE1BBLU.png). It says ""WP8 No Large Tiles"" in the image
13. In Springtomize
14. Open PerPageHTML, ""Internet"" to Page 3, ""Media"" to Page 4, ""Settings"" to page 5, and ""Games"" to page 6.  
15. Respring.  
16. Arrange the icons on your Springboard properly. After this step your springboard should look something [like this](http://imgur.com/a/7yoMz).  
17. Enable the WP8 Icons Theme.  
18. Enable the WP8 Blank Tiles theme
19. Finally
    Note that if you choose to enable the widget
18. Respring

##Complementary Elements
- Open Sans Light is a very slick font that goes very well with this theme.  
- ColorKeyboard with WP7 Gray + Mango looks awesome as well.  
- Blackout is a good tweak if you are using ""WP8 Clear Lock""

##Customization  
______

This section is for those who want to have unique layouts

#*Weather*  
Simplest things first! To customize the weather tile on the home page

#*Large Tile pages*  
1. Open ""LargePages/Page.xcf""  
2. You will see the ""Home"" page template. The guides are for aligning the tiles properly
3. Each tile has its own layer group
4. There are also several large banner layers
5. Use the icons from the packs found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/t24kzoqn22erfc1/wPhone_IconPacks.zip) to make your own.  
6. You will need blank icons for the real icon that will be in its place. For this you can copy the icon in ""WP8 Blank Tiles.theme/AppleBlank.png"" to the proper folder  
   for Stock/Cydia icons and the icon in ""WP8 Blank Tiles.theme/AppStoreBlank.png"" for AppStore icons. Obviously

#*Custom Iconoclasm layouts*  
You will need to do this if you are planning on using a different large tile background than those provided.  
1. Open Iconoclasm Layout Builder.  
2. Open the ""Iconoclasm Layouts/All Small Tiles.plist"" file within the program.  
3. You will see a 4x6 grid of small tiles. Wherever you want a large tile
4. The naming scheme I used is like this: A layout with 2 large tiles on the left starting from row 2 and 1 on the right starting from row 3 would get the name ""WP8 2 UMLeft 1 MRight."" This effectively translates to ""**2** starting from **U**pper **M**iddle row on the **L**eft column and **1** on the **M**iddle row on the **R**ight column"" This made sense to me at the time but I realized how crazy it was as the amount of layouts grew. Feel free to give them to more sensible names.  
5. Upload these layouts using either Iconoclasm Layout Builder
6. Enable the layout on the proper page and respring

#*Small icons*  
1. Open ""WP8 Small Tiles.theme/AppleIcon.xcf"" or ""WP8 Small Tiles.theme/StoreIcon.xcf
2. Customize to your liking. The Stock / Cydia icons will take like half a second longer
3. The basic process is finding the icon you want to use, moving to proper origin, and anchoring to the existing layer.  

##Notes
__________  

- If you want to modify or redistribute this theme
- This has **NOT** been tested or configured for the iPhone 5. I would love if someone ported it
- If you don't want the widget
- If anybody knows of a way to remove the dock **without** changing the icon layout
- Obviously
- I finished the weather tile like
- Only apps that I currently have / use on my phone / can easily theme have been themed.  
- I really advise giving a shot at theming your own icons
- I will take some icon requests, so unless the icon is easy to make with the packs I have, I'm afraid I won't be able to do a good job.  
- If you want to try and request an icon, the icon name, and the color you want the icon to be. The ID and name can usually be found using AppInfo, available in Cydia.

There are 38 minimal retina ready icons (V1 pack) for iPhone 5. My original plan was to have way more icons, etc... basically a full user interface. I got sidetracked and prioritized other projects that I've been working on for the past few weeks and I apologize for that. Because I still have a lot of work to do on other projects, I'm only releasing the customized icons and the keyboard.  

**WANT MORE ICONS?**  
You can request for them only here and I promise they will ALL be made.  

**USE THIS FORMAT AS AN EXAMPLE**     
Name of App: App Store  
Bundle ID: com.apple.AppStore  
Icon: icon@2x.png  

**NOTE**  
Download AppInfo from Cydia or use iFunbox (or any other related programs) to find out the information above of the app you want.  

**ABOUT THE KEYBOARD:**  
Along with the custom keyboard, and can be customized through other packages via Cydia. Future releases WILL include the mic. Also, ColorKeyboard from Cydia is required to install this theme!  

**Update As of Saturday April 6nd
Droplet Icons V1 are Droplet Keyboard are officially on the MMi Repo! Get it now!

It's pertty basic. Time is displayed as a string, Snow, Sun all have specific icons for the forecast. 

There are 4 versions included: Dark

Download from [here](http://studiographic.ca/pebbly/). Unzip and copy the folders into /Library/Themes. Activate with Winterboard.

Instructions for getting your local weather:

* Go to http://www.weather.com/ and put your city into the search bar
* Copy the code from the end of the url. Example for Toronto
* Copy ""CAXX0504"". 
* Open LockBackground.html from the chosen theme folder

I'll be tinkering with it

Enjoy.

**Edit (25 Feb.)**

v0.2 is out. 

* Cleaned up some code (thanks /u/balkonkind!)

Many more features are in the works as well, and Velox support, and possibly even an API for other developers to add functionality to Peekly. 

Also, it's really cool. [Here's the Link.](http://vimeo.com/64430875)

Here's the ModMyi info page for Peekly+ as well: [Link](http://modmyi.com/cydia/package.php?id=62728)

This post is surely and purely dedicated to iPad themes only, if you do not know this.). I want to keep this first post filled with a large database of all different kinds of iPad themes, if people submit them of course. :P

But if you are like me, but with no success. Well I am here to tell you to have no fear, for if the iPad is the only iOS device you got, then this post can help you with some themes to get you started with your setup.

Well

Relatively Finalized images at http://imgur.com/a/cUMcb

**To start

**Things required for this theme:**

* My Windows Zip Theme (at bottom of post)

* Iconoclasm

* Minimal HD Slider (or your choice of slider)

* No Calendar Date (on Cydia)

* No Icon Shadow (included in winterboard I believe)

* Transparent Dock (included in winterboard)

* Springtomize 2 

* *Optional* : FolderEnhancer

* Common Sense/Basic Knowledge of editing themes/icons in photoshop and a text editor


This will be broken into a few categories. 


**Lockscreen**

First is the easiest


**Widget Clock**

Same as before

If you want to keep your clock at the bottom as a ""clockdock"" then you're done



**Icons**

I've included the ones I've made
http://dakirby309.deviantart.com/art/Metro-UI-Dock-Icon-Set-678-Icons-280724102

Place these icons in the appropriate folders and you're 75% there. Now it's time to decide where you want the ""big"" icons to go. The problem is, the ""pictures"" ""music"" and ""clock"" box are painted onto the background(which once again, goes inside of the widgetclock theme folder). Here's a screenshot of my homescreen background with no icons on. 

http://i.imgur.com/ayBj1DY.png

The bigger ""icons"" are just a part of the background

**In springtomize set your icons to 120% for the spacing I'm using.**

I hope I didn't lose anyone

Just let me preface this with I do not make my own custom themes


Okay, you'll need the icons you want. You likely found them on DeviantArt, or maybe you have a theme already and some icons were added afterwards that you wanted. Basically, step one is find the icons you want to use in your theme, and know what you want them for. Got them? Okay good. 


Now, although if you felt like it you could call it titcockfuckballs.theme. It really doesn't matter, the name of the theme is what will show up in Winterboard. Inside this folder, make a folder called Bundles. Yes it must be called Bundles, with a capital B and everything. Now, inside Bundles, you will be making folders specifically for each icon you want to theme. You can find the bundle identifiers for [a vast majority of] apps [here] (http://ios.xengi.org/cfbundleidentifier/ios/), we go to the previously linked site/AppInfo, named icon@2x.png. Do the same exact thing for every other icon you want themed: look up the bundle identifier and icon name, although I don't have an iPad so I have no real experience with it).


So, with a folder called com.apple.calculator inside of that, and our calculator icon called icon@2x.png. From this point, SSH into your phone and navigate to /private/var/stash/Themes.XXXX (the XXXX being a jumble of letters/numbers). Copy your theme in here. Go into Winterboard on your phone, and your theme name should be selectable. Select it, respring, and your calculator(or other various icons) should be themed!


The lazy as fuck way to do this(I've found) is instead of making a Bundles folder, so if you decide to do this make sure Summerboard mode is checked in Winterboard. I find this is much less reliable than using the bundle identifiers, however.


The total badass way is to dick around in your filesystem to find the actual app folder and replace the icon for it with the one you want


Also note that pretty much everything is case sensitive


I hope this helped some of you


For transparent icons: If you use them (which many people do, courtesy of [the Glasklart main post] (http://macthemes.net/forum/viewtopic.php?id=16805129&amp;p=1)):

* Connect to your device using SSH or use the iFile app on your iOS device (free download from Cydia).

* Navigate to /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/MobileIcons.framework/

* (for iPhone) Rename ""AppIconMask@2x.png"" to something else

* (for iPad) Rename ""AppIconMask-72.png"" to something else

* Open WinterBoard and reselect the Icons package and Respring. If you don't see any changes yet,False,self,t5_2w997,False,,,t3_183u2a

This theme has been around for a long time, and Blue color mods for the main theme.  It includes UI sounds as well.  It has been themed for HD/SD for both iphone and iPad.  It includes support all the way back to iOS 4.  It is one of the most complete themes I have ever seen.  Icons are darker in color.  They are a square with a rounded corner and the auto app mask is very effective.  The icons are dark, as stated, but they have little bursts of light in each icon.  You'll have to see it to know what I mean.

* FolderEnhancer
* Iconoclasm
* iFile (Or any kind of SSH client)
* [These](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/95913377/iOS%207%20Folders.zip) files (Should have everything in it
* Photoshop (Somewhat optional
* WinterBoard
* An iPhone 5 or iPod Tocuh 5

Sadly

A. Have folder with no name (In the files provided)

or

B. Use iOS 6's default folder naming

So... 

Let's get started!

Part 1.

1. Download the files provided.
2. Use Photoshop to change the name of your folder or just delete the name of the folder. The font is Helvetica Neue-UltraLight.
3. Save that file as ""FEFolderBG-568h@2x.png""
4. Make a folder
5. In that folder
5. Using an SSH client (If you used Photoshop) or iFile (If you just downloaded the no name folder .png) move ""FEFolderBG-568h@2x.png"" to /var/stash/Themes.xxxxxx/iOS 7 Folders.theme/Bundles/com.apple.springboard (AKA the folder you just made)
6. Now move ""iOS 7 Folder Layout.plist"" (One of the files I provided) to /Library/Iconoclasm/Layouts

Part 2. (All on the device now)

1. In the settings app
2. Now go to FolderEnhancer-&gt;Appearance and make sure Use Image File is set to ON and Enable Border is set to OFF
3. Go to Iconoclasm's settings in the settings app. For the ""Extras"" layouts
4. Apply changes and respring!

Final Products:

* Folder with no name: http://i.imgur.com/yKXs77u.png
* Folder with custom name: http://i.imgur.com/TeLwBp3.png
* Folder with no name using iOS's default naming: http://i.imgur.com/HsElCDz.png

Save the file as ""LockBackground.html"" without the quotes. Create a folder with whatever name you want and add "".theme"" behind it. For example my folder is called ""GifWallpaper.theme"".

Place the LockBackground.html file and your gif into the folder. Rename the gif as ""Wallpaper.gif"".

Copy the folder into /private/var/stash/Themes. Go to Winterboard and apply the theme and you're done!

Blur is a relatively new app that adds a gaussian blur effect to photos

* [iOS 7 theme](http://imgur.com/a/jVRC3)
* [Parantheme](http://imgur.com/a/m5UK5)
* [Sarif](http://imgur.com/a/XuiLU)

* [Stock iOS 6](http://imgur.com/a/te4ei)
* [Before and after of the wallpapers used](http://imgur.com/a/zEaoB/)

Obviously

* It gives you a good idea of what the final product will look like on your device
* You can change the blur level much faster than in Photoshop
* You can blur multiple photos much faster than in Photoshop
* It's much cheaper (if you don't already have Photoshop)

Info:

* It's $0.99

In response to the storm of questions

The weather services for a lot of Lockscreens have not been working for the past few days. Personally, PerPageHTML, Flatly, and most of the other utilities weren't functioning either, so something that all these themes had in common had to be broken.

That thing turned out to be the weather API that they use: Yahoo! Weather. Most, a lot posts have been made about the issue.

As far as I have been able to tell, I still wasn't able to get any of the themes to work. The only difference I can find in the response is that only 2 days are returned, instead of the whole week like it was before.

My goal here is to let everyone know what is going on

Hopefully it's just a small malfunction

If anyone is able to find any more information on this

* /u/nienque for her [post](http://modmyi.com/forums/iphone-4-4s-new-skins-themes-launches/795842-jaku-ios-5-a-1106.html#post6802655) to the ModMyi Jaku thread that gave me the inspiration for this project.
* All of the awesome themers who share their icons on Jakurepo for public use.

---

This initial release themes only the stock apps, but that's due to availability on Jakurepo).

That being said, and rename the one that you wish to use as Default@2x.png. Some apps have multiple loading screens (Music, Mail, and Phone for example) so you will need to rename all the images if you'd like to change the icon I've chosen.

I will also be taking requests for apps. I'll be filling most requests from these threads ([one](http://redd.it/1adv7v), but if there's anything not here you'd like to see, that's fine as well. Please keep in mind that the app should have an icon that's available on Jakurepo and is not from the default theme. If you have an icon that you'd like me to use then please include that as well.

---

I should be able to have the follow up release within two-three weeks. It'll include:

* iP4/4s versions for requested apps
* iP5 versions for requested apps
* iP4/4s and iP5 PSD for Jaku
* iP4/4s and iP5 PSD for Ayecon
* iP4/4s and iP5 PSD for MIUI
* iP4/4s and iP5 PSD for FlatIcons
* iP4/4s and iP5 PSD for any other requested theme
* iP4/4s and iP5 PSD for the stock icon mask
* Directions on how to use the PSD and convert it for use with a different theme

The loading screen packs will use Jaku icons

*Alright so there is already a post regarding the tweak which was posted while I was asleep. I had a post ready though so I'll just post it anyway as it contains some more info regarding the tweak

&amp;nbsp;  


There are always ""unlock"" concepts being made. There were the [Piano passcode](http://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/196gba/is_there_a_pianolike_passcode/) concept

###Giveaway info
Include your cydia id in a comment. I will pick random people during the span of ~24-48 hours (to make sure everyone gets a chance) and gift the tweak to them. I might hand out some others too - piano passcode,instalauncher if someone really wants them.

###XPasscode what is it?
This is a tweak much like ""Piano passcode""

Basically

### How do I create themes?
As I said there will be tutorials / doocumentation available. Head over to /r/xpasscode for more info.

### Where can I download themes?
For now I have a private repo (link in /r/xpasscode) but I themes can be downloaded from anywhere. I have gotten a go-ahead from ModMyi to put themes on their repo also!

### I don't like ""themes""
Me neither. Luckily for us

*In fact


### Help
Help can be found here: [help area](http://www.jontelang.com/xpasscode/help.html) or ask in /r/XPasscode

**Updates:**
---

**Themes created by Redditors list**

&gt;~~I've been planning on updating [this](http://redd.it/1amzfq) for a while

&gt; **Edit 8/5/13**: I'm currently [adding it to the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/iOSthemes/wiki/redditthemes)

**Special flair for those who have created themes**

&gt;After moving the theme list to the wiki

---

**New Items:**
---

**AutoModerator is spreading its robotic influence**

&gt;We're considering adding AutoModerator to /r/iOSthemes. The need isn't that great since there isn't really much to be done in terms of moderation work

**Link Flair**

&gt;This is something that I've had in mind for a few weeks now, posts will all be text and color coded. This will make it easier for Redditors to find content that they want to see both while browsing and searching.

&gt;Unfortunately if you browse Reddit exclusively via Alien Blue (and some other Reddit apps)

&gt;This will probably come in the next month or so (probably longer since I suck at keeping deadlines) and then we'll spend the next couple months afterwards testing it out and seeing how it works. If it's good, then it will be added to /r/jailbreak as well. If not, then it'll be scrapped or kept only in /r/iOSthemes.

**Sidebar**

&gt;Something about making it prettier and more readable.

**Best Setup Contest for August**
---

**About**

&gt;As mentioned in [this post](http://redd.it/1hlak1)

&gt; 1. If you submit a setup in August
2. At the end of the month
3. You will have the opportunity to vote on your 3 favorite setups out of the 10.
4. The 3 setups that get the most votes will earn their OPs special flair, and bronze medals.

**Rules** (tl;dr bolded)
&gt; 1. **You can only have one set up in the top 10.** You can submit multiple set ups to /r/iOSthemes in a given month
2. **Please don't try to cheat votes.** If I suspect issues with malicious downvoting or attempting to rig votes (either by using alts to upvote or downvote posts)
3. **Please don't use fake accounts.** In order to prevent cheating via submissions from multiple accounts, there's no point winning the contest with a fake account.

&gt;**Exception for this month since it's our first contest:** I understand that people don't change their setups very often. If you submitted a setup in the month of July and don't feel like changing things up again just so you can be entered in the contest for August PM me before August 17th. If your submission has a score higher than the 7th ranked post for August

**Closing**

&gt;Obviously, then we simply won't do this after August. Winners will still get to keep their flair. Main issues I'm worried about:

&gt; * An overall decrease in the number of setups submitted especially towards the end of the month
* People downvoting posts simply because they want to win
* Subreddit atmosphere becoming unfriendly (which really is the last thing anybody wants)
* Issues with vote cheating

&gt;Alternatively

&gt;I'm aware that this will probably turn into a flat theme circlejerk, then you'll get the upvotes you deserve](http://redd.it/1d4d06).",,False,self,t5_2w997,1375734368.0,,moderator

We are very pleased to announce many major changes in iMIUI v1.1.3! Thanks to you

For example, thanks to /u/seanfletchr and his great piece of code, our lockscreens and iWidgets are much similar to those in MIUI! You can read the full changelog [from our website](http://onehalfkiller.com/imiui/downloads/changelog/) or on our repo.

We hope for you to continue supporting iMIUI!

Can an awesome somebody make a thread that lists all the ""major/recommended"" addons/plugins/themes that are commonly featured on /r/iOSthemes? I think it would help a lot of people out

Sometimes it gets confusing knowing what's what, and aren't always specific. If someone who has the time and wants to could put together a specific list of recommended themes, plugins, etc., that would be incredibly awesome AND helpful to all new jailbreakers (and experienced people, too!).

I sort of imagine it as split into a few different sections... like **Themes (Winterboard)**, **Plugins**, etc., I don't know. As long as it's specific and tells users where they can get the themes/plugins, etc. etc. Interpret it as you want.
