Today was truly one of the best days of my, my grandmother was forced to flee Germany during the Nazi regime because of her Jewish ancestry, even though she herself was Christian. For most of my life I grew up with German traditions, but always thought I could never be accepted as a German even though I felt a strong bond with Germany. A few months ago my mother and I applied for German citizenship through article 116(2) of German Basic Law. After a while we got a letter from Germany saying our application had been approved. I was overjoyed. Today, my mother and I went down to the German consulate and picked up our Einbürgerungsurkunden. We went to my grandmother's house to show her, and we took this picture: http://i.imgur.com/az2FG.jpg

When I showed my grandma the flag, rot, gold! I used to love that flag! I had it hanging in my bedroom. I always knew that was the real Germany - a democratic Germany."" Even after being forced out of her own country, when I ask her what she thinks of Germans she says ""honest, good people"" and ""a country that gave me the best childhood one could imagine - until the Nazis came"". Although she feels she is too old to go through the application process herself (she's 93), she couldn't be happier that her daughter and grandson have become German citizens. And I couldn't be any happier either.

TL;DR: My grandma fled Germany during the Nazi regime and despite everything she still loves Germany and was thrilled that her family had become German citizens.

Life here in Germany isn't really that much different for me from life in the US. Most of the differences really are just tiny or little things that I've gotten used to and/or take for granted.

Here are some of them, just my take on them.

**Home**

Windows. They open in two ways; tilt it back from the top to let in air

I'm not sure if closets physically built into the room are common here; people just have wardrobes. In the US

**Groceries**

Shopping carts are locked and require a deposit to unlock it. Shopping carts in the US are free to take. The ones here can also be pushed in all directions (i.e.

Eggs come in cartons of 6, 12, or more, and are washed.

Bags cost money, and are way thinner.

Americans are used to looking for milk in the refridgerator. You can find such milk in the fridge here too, but once opened, of course you put it in the fridge. I find this milk tastes much better. Milk also comes in 1.5% and 3.5%.

I've seen refrigerator packages of food such as ""American Hotdogs"" which is like a hotdog in a bun with onions and ketchup prepackaged. (Side note

**Restaurants**

You're expected to seat yourself. You really do just walk in the door and find a table to sit down at and do it. In the US, seats you.

At McDonalds (for example), so you can go sit down or stand out of the way of people ordering.

Drinks do not come with free refills here. Most places in the US will happily refill your drink until you burst. In popular restaurants in the US they typically won't even ask if you want a refill and just bring you another cup when they see you're like 2/3 done with your current one. This applies to tea, but not alcohol of course.

Here the waiters typically won't ever ""bother"" you. They'll just take your order, they're more personal and come by every so often to ask how it tastes, if they could bring you anything (e.g., more sauce), if you want to try anything else, deserts, etc.

**Entertainment**

You can order, most theaters have first-come first-serve seating, so for popular movies people will typically show up hour(s) early to wait in line to get a good seat.

**New** Something I find hilarious is [Tanzverbot](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanzverbot#Stille_Tage). There are some days in Germany where dancing is actually forbidden (actually what they mean is that clubs can not be open for dancing). On Good Friday in every state dancing is expressly forbidden. I guess you should instead go to church or something.

**Cultural**

One thing I find strange is that at a job, my coworkers brought *me* a cake to work.

**Other**

What Americans know of as the ""first floor

German (and really

These are just the things I can think of at the moment. I can post more or answer some questions too if anyone has some.",,t5_2qi4z,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/q1lo9/its_the_little_things_differences_between_living/

I recently came back from a trip to Berlin and it was wonderful. I previously had a strong affection for Germany but I had never been there. On a whim I decided I'd make use of my time off and I booked a ticket to Berlin. Well, the food and beer was great, the sites to see, I really soaked up the atmosphere. I am determined to learn the language to a fluent degree now, I spoke very little German there, I said what I could and even that made me feel great. In short, I just wanted to let off steam about how great my vacation was and it sucks to be home (Ireland) and back to reality. I thought about the possibility of moving to Germany one day but now I know I must. I will get my degree in Software Development and I'll continue to learn the language over the next few years.

So I propose that the german hive of reddit allies to do something about it.

My idea is a website where we demand the restructuring the GEMA and its power. There also should be a petition where users could sign to show their support and after a while we will pass these results to the responsible politician(s).

Please understand that I am by far no expert on copyright law but I want to initiate something to change the current situation.

IMO the GEMA is seriously hindering the digital progress in Germany and the concept itself is just outdated.


What do you think?

**Edit:**

Wow

Where do we go from here?

IMO the best approach would be to create a website (e.g.         www.wehategema.de) which should include the follwoing topics:

* FAQ about GEMA and why it is so bad

* News about the ridiculous actions by GEMA

* A petition where users could sign in order to show their support for restructuring of the organozation 

This will be helpful for two reasons:

1. The education of people why GEMA sucks

2. Establishing support

If there are enough people who sign up it eventually will catch the eye of politicians which is the first to bring them down. These supporters are very likely to voters which matters in politics. 

Maybe we (eventually) could even get support by corporations or artists?


psYberspRe4Dd already created [/r/GEMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/GEMA)

How can we do this?


Answer: Division of labour!

Everybody can contribute!

Tasks:

* Website (do you know how to make a proper website?)

* Information gathering (FAQs about GEMA

Since it often takes a considerable amount of time and effort to help you

* **Please do as much of your assignment as you can**

* **If you just use google translate** and then expect the community to fix that mess

* **You will have to offer something in return:** It doesn't really matter what it is, do our taxes or tell us a joke - just be creative! That way, helping out is more rewarding and good times will be had by all.

A FAQ could offer general advice and there could also be a section where top ""advice"" posts could be added so that users wouldnt need to do the searching

If not a FAQ, it could be added to the sidebar so people with questions could go there. 


Does anyone else think this is a good idea? Thoughts?

**EDIT:** Anyone interested in helping me put together a FAQ thread we can refer users to? We can get look through the questions which have been most commonly asked and start from there. This would require facts with supporting sources. Personal experiences would be added to the Thread in link-form (referring people to previous threads with opinions and experiences). I suppose I would want it more factual and less opinionated.

I recently had the opportunity to spend two weeks traveling around Germany with my brother and sacrificing sleep to see as much as I could.  It was a fantastic time and I couldn't have asked for a better way to spend my vacation.

We managed to see a lot in two weeks: [Dresden](http://www.flickr.com/photos/96669799@N08/8872323762/), [Hamburg](http://www.flickr.com/photos/96669799@N08/8872305706/), Bremen, [Frankfurt](http://www.flickr.com/photos/96669799@N08/8872294632/), [Cologne](http://www.flickr.com/photos/96669799@N08/8872277974/), [Augsburg](http://www.flickr.com/photos/96669799@N08/8872263954/).  But there was so much that we missed due to time constraints. (Also getting lost more than once.)  

Travel and lodging was a much simpler matter than in the US.  Having a six day Deutsche Bahn rail pass made travel an uncomplicated matter.  We never had to worry about buying tickets or train times (except perhaps reservations for long journeys).  Hostels made lodging a non-issue. We could book a day in advance and that gave us maximum flexibility in our schedule with a minimum of cost.  Hostels also gave us an introduction to some interesting and fun people.

Some of the interesting highlights were:

* A particularly ‘interesting’ hostel that was located on a [houseboat](http://www.flickr.com/photos/96669799@N08/8871701421/)
* An American themed ‘[Red Cup](http://www.redcupparty.de)’ party at a club in Cologne
* Visiting some of my brother’s exchange partners/friends (local contacts are invaluable!)
* Augsburg (A surprisingly fun/beautiful city)

I had so much fun exploring Germany and I can’t wait to go back someday.  If I spoke better German I would seriously consider getting a job there (IT is in demand everywhere

The German people were awesome and helpful (if a bit reserved). While it was certainly harder to meet people in a more than ask for directions sort of way

Also this subreddit (along with others such as /r/travel) was a fantastic resource for that extra bit of knowledge to make my trip go smoothly.

TLDR: Germany is awesome!

The first mistake was in lying about the wage.  If the workers were promised 9.50 per hour

As for the complaints about having to walk 18 kilometres per day, no doubt about it, but that's why you're getting paid.  So I don't have any sympathy there. 

The big difference I notice is that the Amazon warehouses are in the middle of fucking nowhere, and it was very enlightening to meet many of the 'unwilling to work' Hartz IV people who were hoping to break out of the cycle of unemployment and actually make enough money to live on.

On the whole, but they didn't treat us like shit, and at the end of a stressful night shift, they would break out a couple of crates of beer, instead of sending a neo-nazi gang to intimidate us.

1362849035.0,19z6o4,A friend wrote a guide: Renting Apartments,DHGG86,81,14,7,"* EUR quantities are examples. 

**Kaltmiete** EUR 240
This is just you pure rent (without the inclusion of any additional bills, electricity and other costs you have to pay like trash and maintenance fees).

**Nebenkosten** EUR 72
These costs are for general additional costs like the fees for your maintenance and trash. A lot of times this will also include the cost of water (but you will have to double check on that - do NOT just assume it's automatically in there). Sometimes it may also include the cost of gas - but VERY unlikely! In most inserts you will see the cost of gas listed separately. In VERY rare cases it also includes the cost of electricity. However

As we had discussed, you may have to pay some additional Nebenkosten (it should generally NOT be a lot). As an example, I ended up having to pay an additional EUR 10 at the end of the year, because the trash fees went up. But that was EUR 10 for the ENTIRE year. Do NOT just accept the landlord telling you that you need to pay more. Mine automatically provided me with the letter from the city of Frankfurt claiming that fees had been raised and a full breakdown of all of the fees that were included in the Nebenkosten (like a bill). That is how it should be! Also, the determination of Nebenkosten, the billing and handling of it, needs to be part of your contract.

**Heizkosten** EUR 30
According to this insert, there are other mechanisms.

I myself do not pay heating costs to my landlord, whether he will charge you more, should you use more, and ALSO, if he will refund you if you used less. If he says, this is a flat rate, then he should not charge you more or refund you. Make sure that you are clear on this point. In cold winters (like this past one), AT LEAST).

**Gesamtmiete** EUR 342
According to this insert this is your ""warm rent"" (total rent). Again, you need to find a basis to compare them. 

**Stromverbrauch**
This is the cost of electricity. As this insert lists what they THINK you will use

I pay about EUR 40-50 a month for electricity (that is a LOT for my small apartment, do not expect for this to be lower than EUR 30 per month. At the end of the year, they will send you a bill showing what you have used, versus what expected monthly fee of your usage they charged you and you will either get a refund or have to pay on top.

**Kaution oder Genossenschaftsanteile - 3 Monatsgrundmieten**
Kaution is your deposit (do NOT confuse this with ""Provision""). This apartment says your deposit is 3 monthly cold rents (so, you pay for 3 months double rent - once regular rent for the month and once Kaution). However, a lot of landlords want to have it up front. Be aware of that! You have the law on your side, but if you agree in a contract that you will pay it upon moving in, then you have to cough up 4 months rent right at the beginning (3 months Kaution and one month rent for the first month). 

It is standard practice that this will be deposited into a SEPARATE bank account (banks have SPECIAL accounts just for that - called Mietkautionskonto) and you should be made aware of the bank's name AND account number for this account (also, deposit the funds and grant them power to access the account if necessary (and then just send them the receipt). This needs to be part of the contract!!! Do NOT just agree to give him the money in hand. 

This is a DEPOSIT. If you trash the place, then he will refund the money to you (the definition of the term ""just fine"", I mean with that, the condition the apartment was taken in and should also be given back, should also be part of your contract). Also, be aware, you are NOT entitled to receive the deposit back right when you move out. The landlord has the right to keep the money until the ""Nebenkostenabrechnung"" for the year is through, most landlords just give it back to you upon moving out (or a part of it

As you may have noticed, instead of paying a Kaution, you purchase shares of the company holding the building, putting you more into the position of being a renter with ""owner aspects"". It has many potential advantages, especially if you choose this place for a longer period of time. MAJOR downside - if they make major repairs on the building and the fees that have been collected so far are not sufficient to cover the construction costs, you may be on the hook to pay the difference. Again, you will likely not see this.

**Provision fuer Mieter - 2.38 Monatsgrundmieten**
This is what we talked about with the finders fee that you would have to pay for this apartment (2.38 cold rents so 2.38 x EUR 240). I refused to pay that and did not look for apartments with that cost. If you agree to it, possibly the whole deposit (so 3 month's cold rent) AND 2.38 x cold rent for the Provision. That is more than 6 months rent in the first month - be aware of that!!!

**SCHUFA Auskunft**
This is the German equivalent of a credit report. It works a little different than in the US. However

Cities and landlords are different when it comes to SCHUFA. In Braunschweig

Regardless of the SCHUFA, you do not have the option for your parents to sign with you. I am thinking, offering the full Kaution upfront is reasonable enough. Do not let him back you into a corner. There are other places!

**OTHER NOTES**

This apartment includes a kitchen. That is NOT standard in Germany. Generally the kitchen (room) should have all the plugs (e.g. water, but the actual kitchen with a stove and fridge are NOT automatically in there. If an appartment does have a kitchen, it will for SURE be included in the listing (it's a MAJOR plus and attraction for people). However, BE AWARE (!!!), some people want you to BUY the kitchen (meaning, you rent the apartment, but purchase the kitchen). REALLY pay attention to that (they usually list this in the written description on the bottom of the page, is from what I have seen

This apartment is also fully furnished - again

In general, you will have paychecks to proof security, your German will be better and you will not just pick the first crappy appartment/ landlord that will have you bc you are under time pressure.

But what I really want to acknowledge is my story on my very last morning of my trip. I took the bus from an Osnabrück bus station to the airport for a relatively early flight connecting in Frankfurt. After getting on the bus, my iPad, my digital camera (with pictures from the trip!), my jewelry (yeah, I'm a girl, it turns out, so this was a big deal)

The bus driver turned around immediately, and no one had seen anything happen. The bus driver and I agreed: it was gone.

I got back on the bus, adding that she hoped she'd see me again for printing my boarding passes.

The police offered to get me out of Germany and into the States with no passport! ""Yeah, and my trip TO Germany took place with a valid passport, and since I had a US-issued ID (my driver's license), and since I'd checked in online the night before and input my passport info, I thought I had decent odds of being allowed entry after serious questioning and decided to take their offer of exporting me.

Then, in terms of filing a police report and such. He said he had my backpack!

This is when I decided I was IN LOVE WITH GERMANY. He went into the city at 8am on Saturday morning, pedestrians had seen an abandoned backpack, didn't want it to get stolen, and had found the nearest open business--a bakery--and gave it to an employee. We told the airport workers, who were all happy for me, and they assured me that I would not miss my flight, and that they would hold it until I had my passport, got through security, they seemed confused; I guess Osnabrück never called to let them know all was fine.

What the hell, MAYBE if the passport was stolen forcefully, but not people who lose their backpacks.

Personal info:

When I arrived in Germany in 2001, he offered to support me through school and University. In the end, I left with my parents. A couple years later, in 2006, he died from liver complications. I've phoned him a couple times when he was dying in the hospital but at the time I couldn't do it. I can't remember thanking him for all he has done for me. Is there anyone who can find and visit him for me?

I love Germany

How to put this delicately....

**Why do your bathrooms suck so hard?** 

Seriously. 

Maybe it's culture shock but I expect toilets to annihilate my poop and teleport away my pee and I expect them to be hands-free so I don't get someone else's pee residue on me. But German toilets just kind of slosh things around. How are dogs supposed to drink out of toilets here?

Bathrooms in commercial settings in the US used pressurized water that could flush a small dog

You have to push that stupid button on the wall above a German urinals for like, what are you supposed to do, push that with the back of your head? I want my poop to be gone before I get done standing up, in germany I have to hold that button down for like 20 seconds to and watch, and watch, and watch.

And those looping cloth towel dispenser thingys? What is this

Every time I fly in to Frankfurt and see the efficiency of their airport, I feel like the US is a backwards third world nation.

Every time I see how stylish people on the streets are dressed I feel like a slob. I actually buy new clothes just to not look like an American every time I travel here.

Every time I use the bathroom I leave it and throw my fists into the air and shout ""USA USA USA"".

I've only used the restroom in hotels

Let’s start with some big ones:

Germans come across as overly serious and strict. But that’s old news.
You better get out of the way on the Autobahn
Germans can’t stand loud kids or kids in general.
In a formal setting you better stick to the plan and do so without delay—otherwise
Germans are initially fairly reserved when it comes to meeting a stranger.
You’re also going to experience the awkward moment when a friend introduces you to his or her close friends. The newly introduced female will approach you for a hug and kiss both of your cheeks. Woah.
Smoking is almost still socially acceptable over here. Don’t be surprised if you find yourself standing in circle of smokers or in smokey room. 
Don’t jaywalk. You’ll likely get a hefty fine—or worse
If you spend an evening out on the town, they’re pretty liberal; don’t be surprised to see some 15 year olds drinking vodka on the street. Oh yeah, you can legally drink as much as you please in public. You can even drink alcohol in a moving vehicle as long as you are a back seat passenger. 

If you’re invited over to someone’s apartment you’ll certainly notice differences.
The doors. You aren’t going to find any doorknobs. 
Inside
You may notice—well
The German toilet. While most toilets in Germany have a superb flushing function, whatever you put in there will not be submerged in water pre-flush. Rather, it will be exposed to fill the room with your aroma. 

In Germany, that’s not common. If you’re American, you’ll be used to finding a fast food joint on every street or highway exit. You won’t here. So, plan accordingly.

If you’re going to talk sports, or if you’re linguistically advanced, Fußball. Back home in the States you might be comfortable taking a jab at a friend’s favorite team. But tread carefully in Germany. If you go too far here, you might be sitting on your return flight with a broken nose. And, don’t even dare bother with baseball. They won’t get it. 

Do you want to see a wide-eyed German? Try leaving the typical American 20% tip on your bill. Your waitress might just kiss you. 
Germans are also very direct. They criticize very openly
The American baseball cap is frowned upon—this is a huge issue for me. 
Wait for the “Guten Appetit” signal at the beginning of meals to start eating.

Hello!

I need to find Heinz.

**The story:** My friend did NOT have an awesome childhood (Won't go into detail for the sake of his privacy) yet despite it, kind, *good* people I know. He avoided his home as much as possible by going to an after school youth place, and he credits one of the staff as the only positive male role model of his not awesome childhood. I would like to give my friend the opportunity to get in contact with his role model... either to catch up, or to thank him for his help, or whatever he wants.

**The situation:** My friend moved away before he was a teenager

* a worker at an after school youth place
* named Heinz
* this youth place is most likely in Buchholz outside Hamburg.   
Very small possibility this detail may be incorrect.
* this would have probably been around the years 1992-1998.  
Very small possibility it was before.

**TL;DR If you are (or know) Heinz who worked in a youth centre in maybe Buchholz at some point during 1992-1998 PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE have him PM me or reply in here. I would love to do this for my friend for Christmas

--------------------------------------------

Hallo

ich bin auf der Suche nach Heinz.

**Die Hintergrundgeschichte:** Ein guter Freund von mir hatte leider keine sehr schöne Kindheit. (Ich werde nicht ins Detail gehen um seine Privatsphäre zu schützen) Er ist einer der fleißigsten

Nun würde ich meinem Freund gerne die Möglichkeit geben wieder Kontakt zu seinem Kindheits-Vorbild herzustellen. Entweder um wieder Kontakt aufzunehmen oder auch um einfach nur Danke zu sagen. Was auch immer für beide okay ist.

**Die aktuelle Situation:** Mein Freund zog noch als Kind weg und hat seitdem jeglichen Kontakt verloren. Leider hat er sich seit damals auch nur wenige Informationen merken können.

Alle Details die ich habe sind:

- sein Name ist Heinz

- er arbeitete in einem Jugendtreff

- der Jugendtreff war sehr wahrscheinlich in Buchholz nahe Hamburg. Obwohl eine kleine Chance besteht

- Dies alles hat sich ca. zwischen 1992-1998 abgespielt. Möglicherweise auch etwas früher

Wenn sie also möglicherweise Heinz sind, melden sie sich bitte.

Ich würde dies unglaublich gerne für meinen Freund zu Weihnachten möglich machen. Ich bin mir sicher,False,,t5_2qi4z,1355082219.0,,,t3_14fkbp

Yesterday she told me something crazy

This is absolute total complete 100% unadulterated pure BOLLOCKS!! I don’t know if this is a regional thing

I tried to understand how this started, on TV, in the papers, and it is a generally accepted truism that this is how it is in England.

I just want to tell you that this is categorically definitely not true! It is just mental. People in the UK do not hate German people, from my Dad and in school, and I was always taught that the reason any atrocities that occurred in the war came about because of one man and his party of ignorant, confused and brainwashed minions. 

There are so many people in the German army that either followed orders

The average German and the average British person is the same. 

I hope this makes sense

Love from an average UK citizen. X

Edit: is this a generally accepted truth in Germany? 

Edit2: This has been great, there just isn't enough German people walking about to even target, and of course Germans don't stand out in the crowd, so I cannot imagine people purposely thinking of finding krauts to bash. England has some shitty areas, especially in big cities (like everywhere, I know) and I wouldn't recommend myself going there let alone someone who could be targeted for being foreign. But that is social problems evident in most places, due to boredom most probably.

I'm just glad that there is not a culture of fear about this

1368009324.0,1dxaie,Questions regarding P2P filesharing in Germany,Dude_NL,33,7,51,"Hi Reddit

Recently my german girlfriend received a written warning ('Abmahnung') urging her to pay the rediculous sum of €800 because she allegedly downloaded a copyright protected movie by means of P2P filesharing (actually she's accused of making said movie availlable to others).

I've read the letter and although I understand most of it

I'll not go into details any further


My questions are :


1) Should my girlfriend (re)act on this Abmahnung? If so


2) Apparently the lawyer firm sending the letter has retrieved her real address through her (non-static) IP address.  Is it common practice for German ISPs to hand out such information so easily?

On a [privacy related wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_aspects_of_file_sharing) I found the following :
&gt;""In Germany court specifically considered the right to privacy and in March 2008 the German Federal Constitutional Court ruled that ISPs could only give out IP address subscription information in case of a ""serious criminal investigation"". The court furthermore ruled that copyright infringement did not qualify as a serious enough offense. Subsequently
&gt;

On a [german filesharing related website](http://www.iggdaw.de/regeln-fur-abgemahnte) I found the following:
&gt;""Panik und Angst sind natürlich ein schlechter Ratgeber. Es ist Teil ihrer Strategie! Sie sollten erkennen: es handelt sich bei der Abmahnung um ein sehr lukratives Geschäftsmodell, mit einfachsten Mitteln schnell und einfach Geld zu verdienen.""


Being Dutch myself I'm honestly quite blown away with how German law firms are apparently getting away with doing 'business' like this.

Any tips how to deal with this situation would be much appreciated.",,t5_2qi4z,1368009564.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/1dxaie/questions_regarding_p2p_filesharing_in_germany/

The app collects news from German (and English) news sites. You can then read the news in German (or English) and if you don't know a word you tap on it to obtain a translation. You can also read Wikipedia and Wiktionary articles on that word for more information.

I made it while living in Germany as an ex-pat and I wanted to read the news that the Germans were reading.

It uses the FreeDict dictionaries for translating

My boyfriend is from Germany and we been dating about a year and a half. I studied in Germany for five months and he is currently studying here in the US. He will head back in January, if we stay together, I would need to be the one moving to Germany. This is something I am willing to do, but I know it's easier said than done.

I am trying to grasp the likelihood that I would find some way to (legally) stay in Germany longer than the 90-day tourist visa. I want us to be able to try living together for a few months like a normal couple, I won't have to pack up at the end of this period and be (temporarily) barred from seeing him again.

What would you suggest I look into, should I get CELTA certified as a safety net? Is there a demand for project management skills in Germany, or a specific way I can market those skills? (It's somewhat of a booming field here).

Does any of this seem feasible? I am trying to be grounded and thoughtful but I realize this can still come off as just another idealistic American biting off more than they can chew.

Long story short

* **What?**

My brother and I want to give to my sister each month (during one year) a box full of little typical things from a random country, **it's Germany** ! :)

We can buy little things (I live in Strasbourg)

* **Why?**

The truth is, and I think she's doing some kind of “thirty midlife crisis”. She's got a job (as graphic designer), a great bf of 10 years, owns a flat (she’s paying off), but she doesn’t know if it’s the life she wants to live anymore. She is dreaming of freedom, seeks change, wants to travel alone all over the world, meet amazing people and take some time to think about her life… But she doesn’t know if she is “brave” enough to do it (reason and emotion say something clearly different and she doesn’t know which one trust).

So why the postcards? I don’t know if she should follow her thoughts

* **What can I do?**

If you’re willing to help: **Thank You!** (But if not

It’ll be perfect if it’s in the original language of the country. Anything is great! She is cheerful, helpful, and have a great sense of humor. You can write funny things, silly things, words of wisdom or hope, wishes, poems, add a real flower or leaf

PM me (or comment) and I’ll send you the address (it’s in France). 

Even if I’m not wealthy, so if you want, I can give you something in exchange for the card+fees (Sending a card in return? Money via paypal? An awesome ultimate upvote?). I know it’s not costly (maybe 2-3$ maximum for a card+stamp?), but it's the least I can do.

I have a pretty big problem and I'm not really sure what to do.

I work for a large German chain and I'm being repeatedly harassed (verbally and physically on a daily basis) by my co-workers.

I guess I should begin by mentioning that I'm male

The harassment includes:

* 
calling me ""asshole"" and faggot"" (in german
* 
 grabbing my ass and dick
* 
 punching me in the chest/arms
* 
 hugging me against my will
* 
 pinching my nipples
* 
one of them grabbed my hand and forced it against his erect dick
* 
asking if they can ""fuck me"" after work
* Generally screaming at me and intimidating me.


All of the above happens pretty much daily (except for the erection incident

There are about 4 people who engage in this type of behavior

If I complain to my main boss it would effectively annihilate my working relationship with these people and make things extremely uncomfortable. 

I would be ostracized and basically laughed at by the entire restaurant.

I haven't said anything or complained because I need this job (badly) and the people harassing me have been there much longer than me. Also

I'm also a afraid of violent retribution if I complain. One of my co-workers said ""go ahead

Anyway

In short

I don't have many friends here in Germany, I'm ashamed and embarrassed.

I also live in a small town

I'm really at a loss and I don't know what to do.

I guess my question is twofold. What are my options legally? And what are my options health-wise?

Honestly

Should I go to my hausarzt tomorrow morning

I'm never sick and I always show up on time

Also

Am I legally required to tell my boss the reason for my absence? If not

And then

The whole situation is really horrible

Some facts: I'm an EU citizen (not German)

""Ich glaube wir sind nicht so..."" and he trailed off.

That's never ever happened to me before and needless to say it kinda ruined my day.

I assume his demand to be addressed as ""Sie"" is just some sick German way of saying ""You're new, go fuck yourself""? Or am I way off the mark here?

I've been in Germany as an exchange student for nearly a year now

1.  The Bundestag has a baseline of 598 seats

2. Every German national who's 18 years old or over AND has resided in Germany for at least three months is eligible to vote. There's no registration process like in the US. 

3. Every German who's eligible to vote has two votes.

4. The first vote is pretty straightforward. You vote for a politician to represent your local constituency (of which there are 299 in the whole country) in a first-past-the-post election. The first 299 seats in the Bundestag are filled this way.

The second vote is where my confusion starts. I understand that you vote for a party, they receive 15% of the seats. However, when they calculate the number of seats Party A should receive, do they use 15% of 299 (the other half of remaining seats)? Do they use 15% of the total seats (598)? I tried crunching the numbers in the Wikipedia article [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundestag), but the numbers wouldn't add up. 

Another thing that confuses me is the 5% mandate (or three directly-elected politicians in the first vote). I understand that parties need 5% of the second vote to be represented in the Bundestag. However

Anyway

When my husband graduated high school, has not stopped talking about the breakfasts that he had while he was there - specifically the breads and coffees.

Needless to say

I've posted on Craigslist (with a couple of unhelpful return emails) and can't post it in our city's subreddit (bay area/oakland) because he checks/posts there often. What do I do?!

I'm willing to pay someone up to $100 to cook (as long as it's authentic!) but can't figure out what to do. Can you help a sister out?! I REALLY want this to be home cooked - not just bought at a local German specialty store...

Is there anything that you believe is ESSENTIAL in any German breakfast? Any cool German related things that I could give him that would enhance this experience? Any pro tips on tracking down an individual who can help me accomplish this for him? 

Any help would be MUCH appreciated!

Danke sehr!
