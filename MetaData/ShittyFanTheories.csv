A SMART person would obviously know that Bruce Wayne is a seductress and he seduced the Batman one night after Batman saved Bruce's life. Now, so Batman was delusional if he thought Bruce would try to contact him). So the OBVIOUS reason is that Bruce and Batman had a one-night stand and can't bear to be in the same room anymore. It makes perfect sense.


This leads me to think that maybe Bruce is paying off the writers at DC to make them seem to be the same person. Maybe Bruce feels that Batman is his soulmate but is too afraid to admit it so he just hides in his piles of money. Another thing...

Ursula is described as evil by King Triton to his daughters, having harnessed magical powers of greater strength and versatility than Triton's...Triton. And, big surprise, after birthing like 12 kids, she doesn't have the lithe body of a normal mermaid.

We've seen that King Triton has severe anger issues, begging her to obey, because he has seen the extent of Triton's rage. 

So King Triton's fear is that his daughters will be intelligent, because being pleasing to a man is the only thing he wants them to strive for. But Ariel is, as she sings ""Sick of swimming, ready to stand""

The desire to explore land begins when she falls in love with prince Eric. It's an initial step away from the clutches of her controlling father  that is motivated by her attraction to a man. But Ursula knows that even if misguided

So, but no voice. Ursula was hoping that Ariel would realize how shallow Eric is when he falls in love over her appearance and vulnerability, and that it doesn't really matter to him whether she has a voice of her own or not.

This plan fails because Ariel has such a fish boner for Eric, who prince Eric falls in love with just as quickly. It was a last-ditch effort to get Ariel to see Eric for what he really is, and it fails miserably.

In ""Human Nature"" (Doctor Who, so his physical appearance doesn't change. But the device is capable of making physical changes to his body, as evident by his one heart. So it's only logical that the Chameleon Arch would be just as capable of turning a Time Lord into a sea sponge.

This explains why Spongebob's clock talks to him in ""Procrastination"" (SpongeBob, he had no choice but to check the time. When he pays attention to the clock, he hears it saying ""Time's up, SpongeBob."" He assumes it's talking about his essay, but in reality that's one of his memories from when he was a Time Lord.

But wait, my friend, don't leave me now. I have more evidence to show.

For example if we look closely, but there are far too many contradictions for us to be able to take any of it as fact. For example, ""Your Shoe's Untied"" (SpongeBob, s2e1), SpongeBob has a flashback to his youth. He is depicted as a realistic sponge spore thing with shoes, implying that he was made with normal sponge reproduction. But in ""Truth Or Square"" (s6e23) he has a flashback as himself as a fetus sucking krappy patty's out of the umbilical cord (I'm not making this up, by the way.) which implies that he developed in his mother's womb like some kind of mammal. Why his he unable to keep his memories consistent? For the same reason why John Smith couldn't recall instances from his childhood: None of it actually happens. They were just fake memories created when he was transformed.

And last but not least, and yet he somehow fits a whole two-story home in there with a kitchen, living room, bedroom and more inside. It's clearly not the same model that the Doctor uses, as the inside looks different, but it's definitely a TARDIS. SpongeBob, of course

1345318505.0,yfuew,"Well, r/FanTheories didn't like my theory on ""Finding Nemo"", maybe it belongs here . . .",thebenolivas,67,8

THE THEORY: Nemo is a dead/non-existent entity, in Latin, translates to ""Finding No One.) Thus, the movie isn't about finding things - it's about dealing with loss.


VIDEO TRANSCRIPT:

On its surface, and gets himself in a variety of interesting situations. By the end of the film, Marlin learns a little about the great many mysteries of the ocean, and a bit about life itself as well. Delve deeper into the story however, and you will find that loss, and the acceptance of loss, plays an important part in the film. Marlin, cannot let go. His inability to let go and trust others not only limits himself and his friends

It is no stretch of the imagination to interpret “Finding Nemo” as a story based on coping with loss. The themes of loss are evident in the work as a whole, Marlin has a chance going on with his life, not simply being hindered by his past. At a key point in the film, Marlin is instructed by his friend to “let go”. The explicit meaning of the line, to let go of a whale’s tongue, hides with it the true meaning of the film – letting go of the past.

Given all this, in this case, is simply a metaphor. The word Nemo itself, when translated from Latin, means “nobody” or “no one”. This, in a sense, effectively makes the title of the film “Finding No One”. 

Consider Nemo’s abduction towards the beginning of the film. It occurs on what would be Nemo’s first day of school – a day which many parents must learn to let go, as opposed to any other color boat, may draw parallels to the white whale Moby Dick, which represented God, nature, and the great unknown.

The ocean proves to be a vast area to search. True, because of her short term memory loss, essentially suffers loss every day. Despite this, Dory’s character, she proves to be happier and more well-adjusted to coping to life’s problems than Marlin.

It is with Dory that Marlin is tested twice, Dory instructs Marlin to “let go” – a phrase with both literal and implied meanings – which Marlin then follows, leading them closer to their destination.

Other examples of Marlin letting go are easily apparent. It is not a coincidence that Marlin and Dory make great progress towards their destination in an undersea current – an ocean “highway” where a traveler submits his control and literally goes with the flow.

For a search movie, not new clues. Nemo, the metaphor for Marlin’s losses, becomes not a literal goal, but a figurative goal. This point is emphasized by the end of the movie in the last shot. The last lines of the movie are not words of finally coming back together; instead, they are words of good bye. The metaphor of Nemo is fully realized as he fades into the deep blue sea, and Marlin comes to terms with the losses in his life.

   Ted goes into great detail, and sexual conquests (http://i.imgur.com/OBPMuN7.jpg) prior to meeting their mother so his children will understand he has always had a problem. Now throughout the explanation he uses lofty rhetoric about their chance meeting. This is because he does still love his wife and she gave him two beautiful kids which he loves too. Offset this with how Ted describes Barney,(Robin's Husband) by making him out to be a crass, sexaholic sociopath that sleeps with girl after girl (over 250 and counting I believe). 
   On the other hand, the superdate, the string quartet, the 2 minute date. He talks about telling Robin ""I love you"" the first time they met. He makes sure to mention how he had previously cheated on Victoria with Robin, as well as seduced the wife of his boss (the captain) establishing a precedent, and constantly mentions how these romantic feelings for Robin continue to reappear. He makes himself out as a victim by bringing up being left at the altar. Despite doing the same thing to Victoria and Klaus. Finally Ted gives this monologue at the end of the most recent episode: 

All that is 45 days away. But I’m here now, I want each one of them. Look, and if I can’t have them, I’ll have the 45 seconds before your boyfriend shows up and punches me in the face, because I love you. I am always going to love you. Until the end of my days... and beyond. You’ll see.

**Iron Man 1-3:** All happen. Including the bits with Nick Fury


**The Incredible Hulk:** Happens.

The Bruce Banner played by Edward Norton is a separate character who is actually the Hulk but is never seen again after the end of the film.

**Captain America:** Happens much as appears in the film except for the frezing in ice and being thawed out in time to join Iron Man and Thor in their battle for Earth bit. Once again Tony added this because of his ego. The reason he knows so much about the Captain is because of his father Howard Stark.


**The Avengers:** Tony's favourite story to tell to his children. He explains how he became a hero by repeated comparison to actual legendary heros (ego) and also covers up the fact that he wasn't allowed to be part of the Avenger Initiative (whatever that really was).

Now this brings up the question of metabolism: wouldn't this guy have to eat a lot to sustain himself? Well, you have to do a lot of killing in the game, so he could theoretically be eating *hundreds* of hearts. At this rate, he'd never get tired ... especially when he takes down a huge boss and gets what the game calls a ""Heart Container,"" but what Link calls ""breakfast, lunch, and dinner for the next week.""

Spider-man green goblin bombs the crowd and lee uses this distraction to kidnap a little girl (apologies in advance for this one but I'm just following where the clues point)

Daredevil lee is stalking a young matt Murdoch pretending to hold a newspaper in front of his face ( yeah real subtle sperm-man) as matt begins to cross he holds his stick in front of paper as if to say ""I know what your doing perv""  matt walks of and lee checks out his butt mouth agape

Hulk lee exits building and is seen attempting to chat up old hulk acting person with the phrase ""beefed up""  used.

Spider-Man 2 sper-man again uses the distraction of doc-op to kidnap a woman whom he grabs from behind

Fantastic 4 lee reveals his ""normal guy"". Occupation as you guessed it dark glasses wearingdelivery man and his everyday name is you guessed it ""Willy"".

X-men last stand- Hmmm

Spider man three- on this occasion stan contracted an STI. lee had obviously broken into petes room that night and left a little present. Lees line "" I guess one person can make a difference"" was darkly ironic and referred to the cheap hooker he had contracted infection from.

Rise of the silver surfer- sperm-man who's real name we now know is Willy attempts to be a wedding crashed using a fake name.

Iron man- sperm man has killed Hugh Hefner and stolen his identity. Copies of playboy are now sticky before people even buy them.

Hulk norton version- sperm man keeps a large supply of guurana energy drinks in his fridge for his long masterbation sessions

Iron man 2-sperm man has now stolen the identity of parry king

Thor- lee is seen trying to pull the proverbial sword ( or in this case a hammer) from the stone. This is a very clever and subtle reference to Percival the fisher king and his wounded dick.

Captain America- lee plays a gay army captain who comments  to his colleague "" I thought he'd be taller.""

Avengers-plays a run of the mill perv who hangs around the park. On the screen below him a kid at the skate park wears a captain America costume made by lee in return for sexual favours.

My guess is sperm-man will eventually gather all the female super heroes who wear his costumes and inform them that by wearing the suits they are going to have his super babies who will be evil as he is. It will be called the receivers and Loki will be his bitch.

The butterfly he sees throughout the movie is a monarch (Latin: monarcha) comes from the Greek words μονάρχης, **""one/singular,""** and ἄρχω, árkhō, **""to rule""**). It shows him that he is the only one left to rule in the world of people (as he sees it).

He tries to give the zombies his blood - to americanize them

Around him are traces of previeous acievments: thousands of cars and great architectureal designs - scyscrapers and the bringe. But he is left alone and the things that surround him cruble from time. The bridge - one of the main syblos is destroyed - there is no way for him to get to the other side. He uses fearfull machines of death (carrier) for his amusemnt

His name - Rober Neville gives us the idea about what he is. Neville is  French for ""New City"" (NY

In the end Obama/Neville accepts the right of the new wave of immigrants to make their own rules in the city and leaves (with his ""family"" he goes to the ""colony"" - must be Hawai or some other place still holding the stream of newcommers.

But what if they're just victims of the neuralyzer? We know from them going to Cape Canaveral and Agent K's relocation to  Turo 

Yet in no point in  the three film series do we see the MiB do any sort of testing on the long term effects of using the nerualzyer. They don't even do follow up exams with the people they use it on. They just zap you and then let you go on your way like nothing happened.

What makes this even worse is that the MiB didn't even invent the nerualzyer. They got it from some of their Alien friends as mentioned by K in the first movie. Alien friends who probably didn't have many opportunities  to study the long term effects  their new invention had on human subjects.


Then there's the fact that for the most part Alzheimer is a disease most people get in their mid-sixties which means that the MiB wouldn't even notice the effects the nerualzyer had on people immediately. It would take years or even decades for them to notice and they're most likely fighting off alien invasions or  illegal aliens to remember or notice.

Confused? Let me explain. The machine said that the answer to the ultimate question is 42. 

If the ultimate question is ""What is the ultimate question?"" how can ""42"" be the answer? ""42"" isn't even a question! It's a number!

But

So what if it leads us to the answer? Why did Deep Thought say that it is the answer?

Think back. Deep Thought didn't. Remember the question asked to it : What is the answer to life

Why is the answer 42? Let me explain using an example.

Imagine that your father is standing behind you. A friend is standing ahead of you. You do not know that your father stands behind you. You ask your friend who is standing behind you. What will the friend answer? There are multiple answers to the question. ""Your father"", etc.

So we all know and love ""Scrubs"". As a joke I told my friends I thought JD was an imaginary character

""Scrubs"" is portrayed as a show following new doctors, he invents JD as an imaginary friend. Whenever Turk is in trouble, he imagines JD having a good time to cheer himself up; whenever Turk is bored, he imagines JD going on an adventure to amuse himself; when Turk gets married, Carla gets annoyed with JD ""living"" with them, but this is easily explained as Turk's psychological rationalization of Carla's reaction to Turk talking non-stop about a made up person.

In the pilot, Turk gets a little sad because his ""in"" with her is now gone. So he imagines JD hooking up with her, to fulfill Turk's desire of sexual conquest, but only vicariously through fantasy.

During the season of Turk's wedding, and wedding invites, JD is still living the single life, and still hooking up with new, hot women.

When Turk's career does not progress as quickly as he wants, something that is highly unusual for any job. However, if Turk were imagining JD, he could give JD any job he wanted.

The show also offers no reason behind Janitor tormenting Turk. It shows the story behind JD getting hassled, and with no justification. That last part is important, because it also explains why Janitor's retaliation seems so mean. It's not that he's borderline insane and hassling young doctors; a young doctor began pranking him out of nowhere, and then yelling about someone who doesn't exist as his rationale.

And finally, Turk imagines JD but as his best friend. So he naturally identifies with JD. This goes to an extreme when JD has a child. Turk has gotten married and has a daughter, but JD as stayed single. Once a family man, Turk's mindset becomes very far removed from where it was as a single bachelor, rooming with his bestie. Unable to imagine what single guys do anymore, and also unable to have JD marry anyone since he isn't real, JD suddenly fathers an unexpected baby to make his life more similar, to Turk's. Hell even after JD's baby is born

The proletariat bees are thus oppressed under the omnipresent bourgeoisie Pooh Bear.  Their hard work thus only benefits Pooh, at their personal detriment.  Though they can mount a considerable effort by working together under a unified, non-competitive bee-hive coalition (i.e., they are ultimately outdone by the fat bear's eating disorder.  The 1% of the population controls 50% of the biomass.  

Furthermore, the deficiencies amongst the main characters (bourgeoisie) represent the deficiencies in a capitalist society.  All the characters are therefore degenerate, thus making the position of the worker bees appear as a constant, normal state of bee-ing.

Andy would be smart, where as Buzz and newer toys she could only dream of having. Her fanciful dreams represent her world and what she dreams of having. The abuse from her father continues through the first movie as the family moves to escape him at the end. It is persumed that he dies in the time between Toy Story/Toy Story 2. Later we meet her step-father in Toy Story 2 as the villian Big Al. Big Al is a pedophile and shady toy store owner Hannah's mother marries out of desperation. Poor Hannah is subjected to life with this pedophile and becomes even more disenchanted with life at the end of TS2.

Toy Story 3 is then basically Hannah coming to terms with growing up and how nothing in her life will get any better. During some point before TS3 Sid is kicked out of the house (becoming a garbage man), and takes an interest in the child.

Tony: ""Who wants to know. Or what wants to know?""

""There is a threat to our planet and a prophecy has foretold that you are the only one who can help us.""

Tony:""You sure it was me. I have one of those faces"".

""You must come with me.""

Tony:."" Thanks but my mother told me to never get in cars with strange men and this is on a whole other level."" 

""I wasn't asking."" 

He raises his tentacle and Tony visibly under mind control follows him into the ship. it takes off and the screen cuts to black

Ok. That's how we get rid of him.
Then. The Return.

A few years later and it'S Captain America 3 or whatever. 
Another end of credits scene
A desert at night Army men tanks and missiles are everywhere. slowly but surely we see something hurtling towards earth. The army men man the missiles ready to fire when one with a telescope screams 

""Stop! Don't fire!"" (could be coulson if they've brought him back.)
""It's him. I never thought we'd see him again.""
Iron man comes into sight
quickly at first before slowing to a smooth landing in the middle of the troops and officials.
He removes his mask.

PACINO

Tony: ""Miss me?""

He was off in a distant Galaxy for years and because of the distance Time wasn't consistent in whatever world he was in. He aged differently than time on earth. While only three years passed in our Solar System it could have been 40 in that one. Bamn Al Pacino is Iron Man now.
Now you have an Iron Man who's not even comparable to RDJ so you get around the whole ""living up"" to the performance thing. And you have an Iron Man who's spent half a life time working for Aliens. Whole new set of issues (a comicbook tie-in of his time in the distant galaxy) and he can have Alien tech.

Let's face it: Wonka is messed up. He opens his factory after years of shut gates and four out of five children meet their maker within its sugar-producing walls. This is strange

Why is Wonka's chocolate considered *so good?*

It's because Wonka built his chocolate factory over the sleeping body of an Elder God

Whether it's Cthulhu, it doesn't matter, Wonka- at some point early in his life, most likely while building his chocolate factory- stumbled upon the resting spot of one of the Great Old Ones and that first contact shattered his mind.

He withdrew from society and spent years building up his chocolate factory as a sort of prison for this eldritch horror sleeping within the earth. He eventually recovered from the insanity and realized that the monster was stirring.

He did some research into the abominations of the universe

This Elder God feeds off emotion

It's also during these studies that Wonka realizes that he can't keep this up forever. The constant proximity to the Elder God's dreams is causing Wonka to slowly fade from existence. He needs a replacement

In order to facilitate this, trying to weed out the four that he'll sacrifice. His first real test is that psychedelic boat tunnel that passes through one of the chambers of the Elder God. Wonka takes note of the four that seem most likely to experience the strongest emotions. He uses his agent, Slugworth, to determine whether Charlie has the selflessness to essentially run a one-man sacrificial Elder God cult.

Tony Stark is Bender. He was frozen around the same time as Fry (possibly earlier), nearly empty room ideal for testing flaws. Stark then, of course, made the same mistake that Fry did -- tripping (likely due to a fault in the suit) and freezing himself by accident.


He then finds himself in the year 3000, all the glory he gained from being a ""superhero"". This is why when Fry meets ""Bender"" for the first time, he is about to commit suicide in a Suicide Booth. When Fry convinces him to stick around, instead of revealing who he actually is, Stark decides to stay in the suit, hoping that perhaps one day... he might be able to regain all of that glory as a superhero.

* **Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory** is in the future and the Oompa Loompas are former cast members of Jersey Shore. The entire movie is a social commentary.

* **Pokémon &amp; Yu-Gi-Oh** are in the same universe. Actually

* The **Indiana Jones** series started as a loose parody of a Bollywood character, but they would ""ramp up the gayness"" by dressing everyone in codpieces and setting it in Ancient Greece.

* **Spongebob Squarepants** is a kid-friendly American adaptation of the hentai *Dōuçhekåï Nįkâta nō Go!* It followed a douchebag and it's adventures with the anus (represented by a starfish), and, as in traditional Japanese hentai, the octopus tentacles that would routinely make its way out of the girl. The series was a flop that had its footage sold at an Anime Expo auction in 1995. Eventually it found its way to Stephen Hillenburg who was then inspired to make it a child-friendly cartoon. 

*  Pepé Le Pew was originally supposed to be a suave **James Bond**-esque character. When the owners of the Bond franchise threatened to sue

* Inception characters represent the **seven deadly sins**: Dom Cobb is gluttony (he's addicted to shared dreaming), Ariadne is lust (for knowledge!!!), Arthur is pride (that guy walks around zero gravity dreams like he owns the place), and Saito is greed &amp; envy (against Fisher's company).

* In fact, envious, angry, lazy bastard.

* **Quentin Tarantino** is actually Roger Federer. His movies are all allegories of his struggles as a tennis player and the harsh gambling crime-syndicate culture of tennis player management.

* **Prometheus** was actually the race started by Dr. Manhattan. We inadvertently created our creators. It's a causality loop. Don't you dare question me you prideful fat nerd who's probably whacking it on a Google Chrome Incognito window!

* **Hey Arnold!** follows the story of poor kids in the ghetto and how it affects their future. The titular character of the show eventually has an illegitimate child with a married woman from Rhode Island. That child's name: Stewie Griffin. His insistence on cross-dressing is a subconsciously inherited trait from his father

* That's not all. The fat bully from Hey Arnold!, one of which develops a deep-rooted hatred for Jewish people: Eric Cartman. His mother's suggestion that she is the father was to spare him the pain of discovering his true ancestry.

* **Samuel L. Jackson** plays a black guy in every single movie he's in. Yes

* When **Leonardo Dicaprio** dies at the end of *Titanic* he wakes up in a dream onto the beach of *Inception*.

So

Think about it: the start of the world is in LOTR

Some time since the War of The Ring, and some recessive genes are carried until today. Elves are enslaved and breeded selectively by some secret organization of old wizards of sorts. This is somewhere around 6000 years ago.

When the wizards reach complete obscurity, though, but not as much as they used to. Now that wizards are starting to hide, technology starts to advance more slowly.

The ancient school of wizardry (Not being flashy about magic) loses force and wizards adopt wands instead of staffs. Some time later, and it helped him to achieve that. But the ring is rusted for being over 7000 years in the open, so it isn't as powerful as it once was. That's why he needs the Horrocruxes.

After Harry kills Voldemort, after humanity spread so much throughout the Galaxy, the wizards make themselves known to The Federation.

Now that The Galaxy Federation has a power unseen ever by the human race in all of its history, changing all perceptions about being a mudblood that existed. At about the same time, sales for wizard's tea dropped by about 200%, causing everyone to wonder how or why.

Fast forward 1500 years, due to lack of resources. The wizards still have breeded amongst themselves, causing mild speech retardation. This also causes personality changes that make them more prone to be shy about their magic, so they start doing it without special effects (that consumed a lot of energy, so they had to eat a lot)

In between all this war, and that's why it's a long time ago.

It’s become something of a pop culture talking point to speculate on the contents of the enigmatic case. While we never explicitly see what’s inside there are a few things that we can deduce based on how characters act in relation to it. 

We can assume it’s some kind of tradable commodity of considerably high value given that the cohort of young men in the apartment are willing to risk incurring the wrath of a fearsome mobster for it. They were involved in some kind of deal

Not only do we know the contents are of high value

                         It's beautiful.


In asking “Is that what I think it is?” Pumpkin illustrates that it’s a substance he is at least somewhat familiar with. Given the circles he moves in

Indeed, at which point Vince emphatically declares “Yeah, we happy"" and exhaling, almost overwhelmed. 

So based on this, what is valuable, beautiful and gold?

Knapp assumes that the Island of Sodor has to turn a profit and is miraculously ahead of the rest of the world in AI. It's not. 

In the far, some opt to become trains. The Island of Sodor is the home for these, who live out the rest of their functioning lives under the tender care of Island program director Sir Topham Hatt and the Great Western Railway. 

The GWR exists to keep these AIs sane, neither acceptable in the mores of the time. 

Going to visit The Other Railway is a reward for good behavior and continued sanity; misbehaving engines are shut in the shed (or a tunnel) until they become compliant. The worst are slowly disassembled. When trains mess up, we have the resources. The trains choose to think that they keep the island economy running, but it could continue without them. 

The ""middle class"" of Sodor are humans who run the tourism industry on Sodor. Other groups of humans provide support for the GWR, and the like. Sodor has some human tourism spots, like Culdee Fell, the beaches, the cricket fields, but the main draw is the trains.

After the events settled down and they realised the damage the supernatural world was able to do during the time she was inactive the government go about starting several initiatives to make sure that nothing like this ever happens again. The world starts to rebuild and manages to become something like its former self but some cities becoming vastly different. 

One way to combat such a threat in the future is to build facilities around the planet at the locations of the Hellmouths to stop things from other dimensions from entering our world. At this time the effects of the supernatural incursion on the world at large starts to be seen as people start to develop mutant powers. Captain Hammer gains his abilities and Dr. Horrible enters the villain scene. These are pretty small fry so the government does not try to recruit them but when several high profile heroes appear on the scene they put their other plan into action. The Avengers Initiative. 

All is good and peaceful for many years and using the knowledge of these alien beings a great space race starts up. People start leaving the planet and actually colonising space is the the great space age. But then events of Cabin in the Woods happen and the world is plunged into chaos. The seas rise and other natural disasters practically making the planet practically uninhabitable. With no one left to feed on the Old Ones become dormant again allowing the few remaining humans to start re-building leading the events of Waterworld.

However out in space the Earth-That-Was is now remembered as a near myth and without the nexus that was Earth the few colonies out there become fragmented and battle amongst each other. Eventually the two major players who had enough money to seize on the space race forge an agreement to form what becomes known as the Alliance to fight the Unification war and bring these fractured colonies under one rule. 

But one little ship tries to avoid their long reach and Captain Mal Reynolds manages win a great battle against them by revealing the true nature of the Reavers to the outside world. In an attempt to reclaim the hearts of the Alliance they return to Earth and manage to terraform it and make it habitable again. 

But the Reavers knew they would now be hunted and they fly deeper and deeper into unknown space. Now what was thought to be impossible happens. They meet other sentient beings. Five hundred years pass and humanity has become great again. Their reach stretches deeper into space than ever before. But the Reavers did not die but preyed on other planets and grew. One day they ended up facing the Drej and where eventually killed off but it left the Drej with a fear for humans and when they saw that humans were researching something called Project Titan they feared they would use it to attack them again just as the Reavers had.

In the original timeline (prior to the events of the first movie), who copies the time travel system, but fails to account for the stainless steel construction that allows non-flesh objects to travel through time. 

After Judgment Day, after John. But with humans storming its base, and thinking John was the more dangerous foes, SkyNet could only send its crappiest Terminator model after Marty, the B101, which actually prefers bullying to terminator. It sent the first B101 to 1955. During the human attack, Doc escapes and time travels as well

The B101 arrives in the past and adopts the identity of Biff. With no background or family, and begins bullying George McFly so that no woman will ever want him, and thus intends to prevent the birth of Marty. This fails after George falls and Lorraine falls in love him while taking care of him. Biff, unable to disobey his last instruction to bully George, continues harassing him for 30 years (up to the events that begin the first movie).

Doc, and thus the first film occurs. After George ends up punching out Biff, Doc captures the powered down B101 and reprograms it to serve George and protect young Marty.
SkyNet, but the second was sent after Doc Brown. Thinking Doc went forward in time, SkyNet sent a slightly improved terminator to 2015. The B102 identifies as Griff, and like Biff, has no parents. Griff successfully captures Biff and reprograms him to be loyal to SkyNet again. 

Thus the stage is set for the second film. We even detect the advancements the B102 has over the 101, and its enhanced reflexes when it grabs Marty’s punch. After Marty defeats Griff, Biff follows Marty and Doc and steals the DeLorean.

Traveling back to 1955, and it is BiffCo which will now invent SkyNet, rather than Cyberdyne. He also improves Biff-2’s programming so that Biff-2 will choose to kill more readily kill. Biff-1 returns to 2015 to determine whether it succeeded, but fades out of existence as a consequence of meeting his past self.

Marty and Doc then arrive in the tangent-1985 and confront Biff-2, desperate act is revealed: A third terminator was sent back to 1885 to wipe out the entire McFly family, which had just immigrated to America.

The Buford B101 was the last to be sent back, and took to killing in a mostly random fashion. Still, with some memories remaining, Buford began bullying Seamus McFly. 

However, deliberately traveled to the same time at the end of the second film, in order to protect the McFly family. Doc deliberately shoed Buford’s horse badly, hoping the horse would throw the terminator and destroy it. He failed, and was killed before Marty arrived from 1955 to save him.",,False,t5_2u8ej,True

In the cartoon-stick-figure web series Dick Figures, at heads with one another. Red is always the victor in these various disputes and conflicts, and often drags Blue through some seriously horrendous shit by the end of the episode. These include, but are not limited to, going back in time and killing all the dinosaurs to satisfy Red's hunger, taking him to 'Sal Sagev' and getting them both broke, and wishing a genie to shut up so that he cannot grant Red or Blue 457 wishes. 

Red also seems to be either completely oblivious to the chaos he causes in Blue's life, almost omnipotent powers. Blue is in eternal suffering as Red basically walks all over him, murdering and causing all kinds of havoc, and almost always gets away with it.

My theory is this: Red represents God, eternally suffering for the choices Red makes, who seems to relish it all.

This can be further supported by various events throughout the episodes; Red silencing a Genie, though unintentionally, and Red basking and glorifying his ultimately evil actions.

Their theory is that the prophecy means that Harry can only die at the hands of voldemort and is therefore immortal.

My theory explains a little more. It answers why Harry survived as a baby (the whole love thing is pretty stupid) and why he comes back at the last battle. Voldemort is not the dark lord mentioned in the prophecy.  He tries to kill Harry a few times but always fails in spite of all the odds in his favor. It's because Harry is immortal and he is not the dark lord. Think about it. Powerful wizard, thinks of Harry as an equal rival. (Maybe not out loud but in his head) the dark lord is....**RON**
