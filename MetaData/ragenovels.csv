- Promoting New Subreddits

- Need Mods for a subreddit I would like to make

- Review on our basic rules

- Bringing Contests to the subreddit

**Promoting New subreddits:**

As you may or may not know

**Need Mods!:**

For a while now I've been thinking of creating a new subreddit to let people blow off some steam

**Going Over the Basic Rules...AGAIN!:**

Although there hasn't been as many lately I still see a few every now and then.  I REALLY HATE having to delete comics because I know some can take time and hard work.  PLEASE

**Contests:**

Contests are something I've tried doing ever since I started this subreddit.  They never really went anywhere and I haven't tried since.  Now that were 15k+ I thought maybe I should try again.  Let me know if it's something you guys would be interested in

So I think that's it for this letter

Also if there are any grammar mistakes
