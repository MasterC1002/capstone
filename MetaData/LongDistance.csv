I (24/f) had a whole elaborate plan that I began thinking of weeks ago. I was initially supposed to see him next Tuesday but his birthday was yesterday so I made some changes to my schedule and flights and decided I would be there on his birthday. 

He was going to have friends at his house but in order to surprise him in the best way possible, so I had to turn it off. I ""got back to my office and had a few minutes so I turned my phone back on"" during my one hour layover in Vegas. Then ""I had to get back to working that event,"" he wished me luck and then I was on my way. 

His friend, which we laughed about, and then I told him my plan. On my way to my boyfriend's house, I texted him saying I was on my way home and we should Skype in fifteen mins. When we turned onto his street, I told him to get online because I was signing on. He went to his room, his friend went inside the house to make sure he was in there, then let his other friends know I was there to surprise him. They couldn't believe it. 

I knocked on his bedroom door

The rest of the night was spent with his friends

Boyfriend and I have been together for 2.5 years, and he'd try to find work here next July/August.

However, the company is great, the pay is better than I ever expected, and our long distance relationship is suddenly long distance no more!

So in just about 35 days, and we are going to make the cross-country drive. We're going to be moving in together after more than a year of being 1200 miles apart, and I cannot wait to see what the future holds after that.

This type of attitude is unacceptable.

While speaking your mind is not breaking any rule

If someone is an hour's drive away from their SO

It is not your place to pass judgment on others.

It's true that some of us barely get to see our SOs (if ever, while others get to see them every week, it really is not up to you to decide what is and isn't a long distance relationship.



It's funny though

If you are not in the relationship


If there is distance, so be it.

Relationships are very personal


While I am guilty myself of thinking ""damn... that person is 100 miles away from their SO, or say their relationship is any easier than mine. I really don't know what their personal lives are like, or the struggles they are facing. If they are here for support, I give it. If they are here for advice, I give it. If they are here for constructive criticism, I'll give it...


But I will **NEVER** judge that persons distance from his/her SO

I am 507 miles away from my SO, you'd probably make the drive to see them often if you were that close.


In my case

And we are also a nevermet couple. How 'bout that.


Big.friggin.whoop.


My relationship is **MINE**.

Your relationship is **YOURS**.


Do NOT turn this subreddit into a pissing contest.

This is NOT what we are here for.


I still cannot say those posts are delete-worthy


HOWEVER

The only time this may happen is if someone comes here saying they live like 10 miles away or something...

I'll kindly say that this is might not be the type of subreddit they're looking for

WITH ALL OF THAT SAID...

Really... who are we to judge?

If someone who sees their SO every day or so is coming here for help... we must be doing *something* right. Our focus is communication

And if it helps them out


Do NOT hate on those who come here for advice.

There were a few reddits who  mocked or poked fun at the OP of posts about a LDR when they asked for help or advice relating to the LDR... because they were different. Lets not turn into those types of reddits.

If someone's here for help... well


_________________________________
**EDIT**
There's been some discussion about my ""never judge"" and ""10 miles isn't an LDR"" mention...

My apologies on not being clear and being contradictory. 

When I said ""never judge"", I wont delete it. I'll just let it slowly pass to the other pages.

What I had in mind (but didn't make clear) when I wrote the 10 mile tid-bit, that person being in a stable financial situation, means of transportation and so on...

A LOT of relationships are like that. And they are not really LDRs from what I personally understand... it's just a drive to see your SO.

If a person with an SO 10 miles away came here because they had no way of seeing eachother immedietly


I cannot give you a defined line when it comes to what is and isn't an LDR. For sure there needs to be lack of physical interaction and distance, transportation, culture, work...

It's just going to have to be done on a post by post basis. I'm sorry if that's not the answer some of you are wanting

If someone comes here because they hardly get to see their SO cause of conflicting work schedules... yet they live in the same house

The best I can tell you is to use your common sense

Don't put yourself in that persons shoes

And in the end

And that's okay.

One thing we all know for sure is that being unable to spend physical time with your SO on a regular basis really  sucks.

Just give support/love if you want. If you feel that sinking


Geez

Aside from the discussion we're having here

Again

There just really is no way to make a defined line.

She cheated on me, I learnt the hard way, long distance relationships aren't going to work if there is one strong person and one weak. You both need to strongly believe that everything will work, that those life plans will come true. 

I did believe those plans, not only love someone x-amount of miles apart from each other, but also support others on here in similar situations! I didn't even realize what I was truly doing until I looked back. 

You people here are truly amazing. You keep believing in your relationship. Keep believing in your dreams and promises to each other, and you're both committed, you will be in each other's arms when you sleep. Not just for week, but for as long as you two are together. 

When you two have arguments, it's hard because you can't hug and kiss, but by god, you can show her or him that you love her or him by making something special, or doing something special. You're not completely powerless. 


And please, he or she loves YOU. that distance has not stopped your love. Think about that. Let it sink in for a moment. They care more than you realise.

As the year passed, and had plenty of time for talking via phone, text or even IM. I also believe that this is one of the shining benefits to long distance dating; your idea of spending time together is simply talking. The more I learned about him, the more I fell for him. I remember calling my mom  and saying ""I think it's over for me."" By this point I was working/living in Iowa- which seemed infinitely closer to him than Mississippi. 

Before I started dating my SO, he would not lot me. And for this, along with so many other examples, I am forever grateful. 

When I moved back home to Michigan, he started working 3rd shift and lived an hour away. It seemed like we couldn't win. 

Eventually, what I imagined, as good as it could get. 

July 31st, it seemed like no one was home. I made my way to his room and saw his computer with Minecraft open, but him no where to be found. The screen instructed me to sit down, walk the path, and to view the sights along the way. As I walked through the virtual world, there were signs placed everywhere describing our journey, the bumps in the past and the ones we'll surely cross on the road ahead. But there was no one he'd rather take that journey worth. And the very last sign,"" made my heart stop. 
I turned around in my chair and there he was

I recently landed a new, at my parent's house, and most importantly, as a long distance couple, is Friday. We're getting married in October next year. 

It's all over. The nights of demeaning loneliness, 100% worth it. 

I just want to thank this community for being so stupidly amazing and supportive. This will forever be one of my favorite subreddits.

• The first kiss after months of being apart. It's like having that very first kiss all over again.

• I've learned to value time. I value the time we have together

• I have something to look forward to. Something to plan for and be happy about when I'm feeling down. Sometimes the distance gets to me

• And of course

• I remember all the little things. Things that other couples might normally take for granted or otherwise not notice. Like a small remark he made during a concert we went to in September

• Just simply knowing that someone somewhere out there cares about me so much

• When issues arise

""Why are you telling us this SLC?!  I've not done anything!""

The reason I am posting this is we are only 4 people.  Some of us can't moderate as much as we'd like so really there is typically about 2 1/2 of us for 4, have other subreddits to moderate so we get pretty busy.  What we ask is that you report any comments you find offensive.  If it's using abusive language, disparaging remarks about your, a loved one or LD relationships in general, racist, sexist, whatever, **make sure that you send a message to moderators that you have reported a link**.  This is imperative as sometimes Reddit's back end system for Spam and reported links is crappy and we can't get to the issue.  They are on separate systems that aren't as robust as the website itself.  What we can get to is PM's and ModMail's.  

I am going through now to make sure the new trolls are thrown out and banned when needed (1 already has and another is probably on their way) so please, you have to call us sometimes to make sure we get to it and take care of it.

Thanks for your attention and please upvote this so that others will see it and read it (hopefully).  

Also, we will ban you, your shitty opinions on our choices in life are unwarranted, unwelcome, and unwanted.",,False,t5_2s6ky,True

1315003994.0,k2z9s,"/r/LongDistance, we should discuss something serious about the young ladies and young men under 18+ that come here seeking advice on meeting their SOs. I want everyone in here (under 18, over, parents, everyone) please. ",133,"Something peculiar popped into my head after reading a thread not too long ago. Young lovers happen. We've all experienced it, there is no denying that.

 A lot of the times it is difficult to discuss the subject with parents (as it was for me) so we turn to friends or other trusted adults to help us out. /r/LongDistance is a safe place for them to come for help and advice from people who are in their shoes.

Now, then more exposed. Multiplayer Games, Social Networking... even websites like Reddit, can all be grounds to meet your significant other. Only difference is that you start off as an LDR. You don't meet them face to face immediately. However, that should never deter you.

The longest friendships I've had have been online. I met a them when I was 13 and to this day (I'm 20) we talk and I've even met a few of them over the years. They are wonderful people. My SO I met online



HOWEVER, I want all of you to please take into consideration the fact that they are underage. 

I was a tad bit alarmed when I saw people happily urging someone within that age rage to take buses to visit their SO

This young lady (I assume) is in school

This may come off as harsh

We, how to make the distance easier, and even encourage them to meet...
**So long as the parents of both parties are aware**.

This also applies to anyone who is 18 or older and has an SO who is underage. 

But none of this romantic running away crap. That almost never works, or with a restriction order on you or your SO placed on them by the parents.

I realize this was not something that was discussed, I urge to please try to convince, if not suggest,  them to let their parents know of the visit and HAVE the parents consent when meeting.

To those of you reading that fall under that age range, and there were times that I felt like running away, or sneaking off would have been the best way to go about it. Looking back on it now I'm glad I never did...


Here you will find people in your same boat wanting to help and encourage eachother. One other thing I want to make clear that this community will never do is shut down someone because of age

""You're too young to know what love is"" is a load of bull

My main concern here is the happiness and safety of our members.  I will happily continue discussing this in the comments. Please keep it civilized. No cursing out and no insulting. None of that.

This is a serious matter that I wish to discuss with the community

On Saturday, he looked about in his 40s-50s and I asked him what the time was. He was hard-of-hearing so I did small hand signals to ask him what the time was. He told me it was around 10:30 or so. I was sitting outside in 40* in a t-shirt and jeans, mostly because I was still really sweaty from the concert. He asked me if I was cold, and then it turned into a conversation about the concert I went to. I learned he was working in the Computer Science department and originally lives in Long Island. 

He asked me what I was doing for break

Turns out, but it was worth every penny. He told me that LDRs do work if you put your mind and heart to it. They are technically in a LDR right now since he's in Rochester and she's in Long Island for the semester, but he said he's coming home for Christmas to see his SO too, just like me.

It took a few years--my dad constantly taunted my mother, somewhere in Virginia where my mom was raised.

Unfortunately, this would have been the end of it--but not for my parents. They wrote letters. They thought about each other a lot. They talked to each other when they could, because in 1970 long-distance phone service was expensive, and there was no internet or skype with which they could see each other.

This went on for a year and a half. My dad graduated. My grandfather transferred to Boston. My dad went back to Virginia and he brought my mother back.

They've been together ever since. It's been over 30 years

I missed this subreddit greatly. Been gone for a while.

Now, tired as hell, but still awake. So while having a conversation with a fellow redditor, and exchanging subreddit reader count information... we noticed that our name, what we are... LDRers (on our sidebar), didn't quite make sense.


Long Distance Relationshipers


Shipers

Ships

Boats


So I am tired, it may be a calm journey, or full of mighty waves, but thats what they do.

Now it doesn't matter what kind of boat you are, distances to close.

I love you all. I'll probably delete this and very much change the sidebar back to normal when I wake up.

Until then good night

You can also get creative and decorate the jar (or use some other type of container). I thought about putting the pieces of paper in a fish bowl and decorating it so he could go ""fishing for compliments"" each day

You can also change the rules of the gift to make it so your SO is allowed to read one note each time they're really missing you

Also, some serious, some sexual, etc.).

Sometimes I say

And sometimes I say, actually.""

And very rarely I say

So here's our story. A couple days before Christmas a couple years ago

It derailed into a thread about how your command of the English language takes on its own ""accent"" on the internet. We called it ""personal syntax"".

Someone tells me they like my personal syntax. We get to chatting

Our first kiss was virtual

""Is there a less obvious way of saying that I really
""No

Our communication was constant. If I was at a computer, we were on skype. We didn't even have to speak, just knowing that I could say something out loud and knowing that he would hear it was enough. I never, ever truly felt alone. Some days we would fall asleep at our computers after skyping for hours and the connection would hold through until the morning. I would wake up and make sleepy noises and he would say, ""Good morning, sleepy-head."" There wasn't a day I didn't speak with him for hours upon hours.

I met him for the first time after two months. I stood in the airport thinking about the thread we first met in, the panic began to mount. Then I spotted someone running towards me. The recognition was instant, and then in the next instant I was being squeezed so hard I couldn't breathe but I swear if he'd have let go of me I'd have just died right there.

It was magic. When our time together was spent

We spent that next summer together. I did something that only seemed a little crazy at the time: moving to his city to do my schooling fully knowing that he would be leaving at the end of the summer to do his schooling on the other side of the country. When the summer ended, let alone a man cry as hard. I had already run out of tears. All I could do was hold him in exhausted silence as he tried to find the words.

We spent the next year apart

It wasn't always easy. Actually, coming full circle to talk things out with a screen between us.

When that year passed

Now we live together

We ALL know long distance is incredibly difficult. Being new to one or not, must find ways to get over it. Be you separated for 2 months, or two years. We know communication, trust, and honesty are MUST HAVES...

Good.

It sucks

But what else is there? What do you do? What are things you've done in order to pass the time and just be happy with your SO? Here's my list of things I've done and things I'm going to do/want to do.


* **Talk on Webcam** (Gmail is awesome and free and easy. You can also use Tinychat JUST MAKE SURE YOUR ROOM DOES NOT DISPLAY IN THE LISTINGS AND IS PASSWORD PROTECTED!)
* **Talk on the phone** (Gmail has a nice phone feature if you don't have one
* **Write letters**. (You can write a letter in a bottle in the US. I'm pretty sure they'll mail bottles) 
* **Make them a letter box/holder**. ( A box or a pouch
* **Play games together**. (Steam as a new selection of multiplayer F2P games
* **Make music videos**. (Even if you suck at singing, and put it in a private Youtube URL, send it to them, they'll love it)
* **Read together**. (Find a nice book
* **Learn a new language together**. (Some libraries offer free language learning services
* **Go on a date!** (**use your webcam**, even if it's not super fancy. Have fun, be it eating taco bell or lobster, use plates, silverware! The whole shabang. You can also send  a date box over to them. Put in some wine, a wine glass, a recipe for dinner, movie snacks [for when you watch a movie together] a cute little list explaining dress code [or lack there of] and just anything else you find would be nice to have on a date. Make sure you get double of everything
* **Watch movies together!** (livestream.com is a bit complicated, unless you don't care for people coming in and out. For you couples with Xbox360's there is also the Netflix Party View! ""people can use through xbox 360s. Xbox Live lets people get in a 'group' and seamlessly syncs up whatever's being watched"" [More in comments!](http://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/jrxfv/you_all_are_upsetting_the_crap_out_of_me_get_the/c2enmn6) )
* **Exchange rings/blankets/pillows!** (Having something to hold when your SO isn't around is nice. Send him/her a blanket you slept in, or a teddy bear... anything! Just make sure it's been in your hands. A teddy bear you've cuddled with means a lot more than one you just buy and send to him/her that's never been out of it's box)
* **Surprise them with pizza!** (Get their address
* **Go out to a coffee/mom&amp;pop shop and share coffee/hotchocolate/meal** (You need a webcam and no shame for this! Set up a ""get together"". Use the wifi at the shop



Seriously, I'll add more stuff as it comes to me or grab it from the comments.

Stop being so sad my friends, a best friend. It's not all so bad.

_____________________________________________________________
**The Art of The Long Distance Date**

You want dinner and a movie? Make it happen. What kind of date is this? Stay at home pajama date? Pizza and a movie? Or do you want this to be super fancy?

REMEMBER TO DRESS ACCORDINGLY. 

For the fancy date, do your hair and nails, get your good pair of shoes out. Show yourself off for him, twirl. Remind him/her what a beautiful woman he's/she's got.

Gentlemen, ahaha) Shave, style that hair. Be a gentleman. 

 I listed synchtube and livestream. However

Enjoy eachother's company, he/she's there. Just watch the movie. If you talk, you talk, if you don't it's fine. 

If you've sent eachother blankets or teddy bears or pillows now would be the perfect time to snuggle up with one of those.

once the movie is done, eat your pizza. Or you can still eat at the table... no restrictions, you're in your pajamas, be silly, get creative.

For fancy dinners, talk about everything and anything. Talk about how silly you feel right now, dressed up, but remind your SO that you're happy regardless, since they are there with you. It's special, long distance or not, sharing time and making memories like these, is very

I know I focused on the ""fancy"" date, but if you don't have one, use the phone, or a type of voice chat. Describe what you're wearing, use speaker phone for the dinner. If you both cooked the same thing, comment on it. Maybe he messed up the rice? Laugh it off. Tell him just to leave it the heck alone next time, and if he can't do that, since he's so bad at it.

Just. Have. Fun.

Love eachother.

I was studying abroad in Singapore, I decided to fly in earlier to surprise him.

1. I asked him casually, early May."" This was an implicit go-ahead. I said ""too bad, I can't make it"" and that was the end of it.
Or was it?
2. I lied about my exam schedule. Said I had one more exam on April 30 and then was traveling to Bangkok. Little did he know that it wasn't the kind of bangkok he expected ;)
3. Totally made it a point to talk during each of my layovers
4. Totally said I was going to Sentosa (a theme park) for the day since I was fed up with studying, Din Tai Fung). This is because I usually stay on skype while studying, so I didn't want any unusual behaviour to be construed as red flags. 
4. Finally, so it would be 12 hours ahead) and was really stressed and needed moral support.

Sure enough, and he was just sort of like wtf wtf wtf wtf wtf!?!?! for the first five minutes. I wasn't sure whether he was mad or just overexcited. It turns out he thought I was him hallucinating (he'd been working superhard on a project very late nights) and having his usual fantasies of me coming (aww!) but alas, it was for real this time. Then he embraced me passionately, and the rest was history ;)

The shock obviously came from the fact that in his mind, studying for an exam. This, of course, couldn't be further from the truth... so when that image, that notion of where I was shattered, it was quite a shock! But he loved it and it's going great so far :)

So

1. Try to stay accessible throughout the journey if possible. If you're away for a prolonged period of time you need to explain it.
2. Do not tell any of your SO's friends unless absolutely necessary. My SO's friends are notorious for being terrible at keeping secrets and excellent at dropping hints. 
3. When you explain absences and whatnot

**UPDATE: On my way home now. Visit went spectacularly. All my worst fears disintegrated. He was so excited about me being there, you name it. Best of all, I really think I brightened up what would have been a really crappy week for him. He was super-sweet, even packing me a going-away breakfast when I wasn't looking and stuffing it in my bag. I'm sure all of you know what those never-ending tender goodbye hugs feel like...sigh. On the bright side, I get to see him again in two and a half weeks!**

He never told me he was unhappy

I feel so betrayed that he would give up on us so quickly after all that went into this relationship.

We had gotten into a rut and I took it for granted that he would wait for me. He said the last time we were together (winter break) it was great and he was happy. 

Now I don't know how to handle any of this. He was my best friend and the one that got me through this terrible year. Now I'm alone and don't have anyone to turn to.

This is just a reminder to never take them for granted. Appreciate the distance because it's better than not having them at all. Also PLEASE communicate with your SO.

(The excerpt is a translation from the original Chinese.)

-----------

The story of how Dad married Mom sounds somewhat unusual, two years after they started dating; Japan attacked America’s Pearl Harbor on December, 1941, which led America to declare war on Japan. As a result, the Japanese army in China went to occupy Yenching University that had been founded by American missionaries, and forced the university to shut down. Since the Japanese army already seized Beijing, Dad, felt it was an unbearable shame to live and work under the rule of Japanese invaders in Beijing. Therefore, and married her a year later.  Today, it would be the greatest comfort to them. Dad wrote a memoir when he was in his 80s and mentioned those years of long separation between him and Mom as “miserable beyond expression… but that kind of feeling was also deep and purified

SO: oh it's not ruined just go upstairs and check

Me:...it's not YOU is it? (i was peeking up the stairs into my room at this point to see if he was sitting on the bed)

SO: no baby

and as I'm up looking around my bed and saying i dont see anything, look outside and see MY BOYFRIEND STANDING IN THE DRIVEWAY THROWING ROCKS AT MY WINDOW AND WAVING WITH A BOUQUET OF FLOWERS.

I though it was all fun and hilarious until I got to the LDR part.

I think that's a pretty dick move to pull. You don't say that shit. :/

Anyways, people saying they do.

Lets show our support over there. :3

No bashing, and they're not a waste of time if both are able and willing to make it work.


I'd also like to remind everyone that LDRs are not for everyone. 

So what may work for us now


Also

""Oh well if you dont like LDRs then why are you in one?""

Because I love my SO and he loves me and we're going to make it work.


 We choose to be in LDRs because we love our SOs

1335254283.0,spo6q,r/LongDistance Survey Results are in!!! Take a look :-D,,80,1,52,"Gather

In the end we had 514 people take the survey. That's around 14% of the number of subscribers at the time the survey closed (3652)

Now

-----------------------

**Age**

-----------------------

As anyone could have guessed, and our oldest respondent was in the 40-44 age group.

-----------------------

**Gender**

-----------------------

Ladies, and 1.6% both, neither, or unsure. On a website predominantly frequented by men, this is obviously a subreddit women are particularly drawn to. I'd hypothesize this is because men are less likely to seek out relationship advice from strangers or less willing to share their personal lives online.

-----------------------

**Sexual Orientation**

-----------------------

With regards to sexual orientation, at 9.1%. 1.4% of respondents identified as lesbians, and 1% of respondents identified as pansexual ([pie](http://i.imgur.com/ezNbr.jpg)). In total, 15% of respondents identified as being non-heterosexual or unsure, which is far higher than the national US average and global average.

I hypothesize this is a result of the very young

Along these lines, it could be statistically insignificant (My statistical know-how is limited, but we also had very small samples sizes for the over-30 age groups), or it could be some other form of sampling bias. I'm not sure!

-----------------------

**Relationship Status**

-----------------------

87% of respondents were dating or in a committed relationship ([pie](http://i.imgur.com/BbLXE.jpg)/[bar](http://i.imgur.com/JwZUz.jpg)). Once again

-----------------------

**Location**

-----------------------

Our respondents come from 51 countries ([table](http://i.imgur.com/3H7JU.jpg)/[pie](http://i.imgur.com/VWau6.jpg)/[bar](http://i.imgur.com/epbub.jpg)) and reported living in 45 countries ([table](http://i.imgur.com/OCTOw.jpg)/[pie](http://i.imgur.com/uNBh3.jpg)/[bar](http://i.imgur.com/96LP6.jpg))!

64.6% of respondents reported living in the US, 2.9% in Australia, and 1.9% in Germany. Other top countries included the Netherlands, Ireland, Sweden, Singapore, and New Zealand. Respondents to the survey represented every continent on Earth

Respondents' SO's live in 52 different countries ([table](http://i.imgur.com/ZEr1s.jpg)/[pie](http://i.imgur.com/Viz69.jpg)/[bar](http://i.imgur.com/Auinb.jpg)). A higher proportion of respondents' SO's live in Japan compared to respondents who reported living in Japan. Interestingly, everyone? :-P

-----------------------

**How did you meet your so?** *and a call to action to help our nevermet friends.*

-----------------------

Most respondents - 58.9% - first met their SOs in person, living, or studying abroad. The other 41.1% met online! ([pie](http://i.imgur.com/s8qlq.jpg)) *27.5% (nearly a third) of those people have never met, and many of them have been together for a long time ([table](http://i.imgur.com/qa1b7.jpg)). Maybe we as a community could help change their nevermet status if they are struggling with that.* Especially for those people who live in the same country yet have been separated for so long, that's a bummer on my conscience.

-----------------------

**How long have you been [in a relationship] with your SO?**

-----------------------

Respondents are across the board with how long they have been with their SOs ([pie](http://i.imgur.com/ApUZd.jpg)/[bar]( http://i.imgur.com/GKLTF.jpg)). 20.5% are new to the game and have only been together for less than 6 months. 26.9% have been together for 6 months to a year

-----------------------

**How long have you been in a LDR with your SO?**

-----------------------

The respondents indicated a similar proportion of lengths of their long distance relationship within their current relationship ([pie]( http://i.imgur.com/1OU65.jpg)/[bar]( http://i.imgur.com/vbrln.jpg)). 31.4% began their LDRs recently, 34.5%, have been in a LDR for 6 months - 1 year. Only 0.6% have been in a LDR for 5+ years. That's perseverance, people!

Here's a cool table that shows the frequency of LDR duration for a given relationship duration ([table](http://i.imgur.com/5FUbE.jpg)). For respondents who have been in a relationship for less than 4 years

-----------------------

**How much longer do you expect to be in a LDR?**

-----------------------

The length of time responders have left in their LDRs varies considerably

-----------------------

I didn't think I could afford a trip to see him though

However, both with cash in them, and I was able to make next month's student loan payment early with enough left over to drive to him and back.

I texted his roommate to find out what their plans for the weekend were and it turned out that he had no plans and both roommates would be away for work. Perfect. I got off work Thursday night at 6 and I had decided, only informing one of his roommates that I would need the door left unlocked or someone to sneakily let me in.

As I drove, and hadn't texted him for the entire four hour drive. I also worried that he would find my impulsive plan intrusive or sneaky. Or that he had some secret plan for the weekend and I would be cramping his style. But I realized that all the times I'd been put in that situation, where I was viewed as an inconvenience or intruder had been with others, not him. It was still so hard for me to refrain from calling him and screaming ""I'M ON MY WAY TO SEE YOU OMG DON'T GO TO BED EARLY PLEASE.""

Still, and his genuine surprise and excitement at seeing me, all my worries gave way to joy. I apologized for being sneaky, and told him I hoped that it was okay that I just showed up. He was in disbelief, he couldn't understand why I was even worried about that. I've never felt so loved in my life.

I know this is just a big story about surprising my boyfriend

I am incredibly happy, though. I am relieved to know that I am loved and that he was touched and excited about my surprise instead of freaked out. I am glad to know that there will not be an Overly-attached-girlfriend meme made about me.

Today marks one month until my wedding day to my one and only girlfriend

We first became friends in 6th grade.  That was the year students at our school would start going to dances, but when another girl beat her to the punch, she had me as her back-up.  After a little hesitation, I agreed to go.  I cringe at seeing the awkward looks on my face in the pictures from that dance.

But the idea of being a couple (if you can call it that in 6th grade) sort of grew on me after that.  I'd send her valentine grams, I learned her family was moving from our hometown in CA to AZ.  It was odd, part of me felt crushed, but part of me still wasn't sure if I should be using the word ""girlfriend"" yet.

It would be 6 years before she came back to California again.  In between that time were weekly phone calls, or just to say hello.  Then there were those wonderful days where we managed to visit each other for a few days out of the year.  I never even thought of leaving her.  I couldn't feel the same looking at another girl the way I did with her.  It got rough watching my friends get into their relationships, seeing them and their SO's holding hands or sneaking off to go make out somewhere… it was something I rarely got to have.

But by the time college started for the two of us, it was hard to pay for my own gas, but I still managed to spend most weekends with her.

Then she got the crazy idea in her head of marriage.  She started mapping out ideas of where we could live, I agreed to give it a chance.

The day came where she could no longer afford to attend college here in CA. 2 years ago she moved to the place we had agreed to move to when we would marry.  It was painful to go back to a long distance after having such beautiful time spent together.

But now in just 1 month

I'm rooting for all if you in a LDR.  It's a rough thing but if you can pull through

Anyway

1) Communicate often. Communicate everything. From the most important to the most mundane. When you boil an LDR down

2) Have set dates, or a visit occurs, or anything for you as a couple, you've just added another brick into the wall that forms the stronghold of your relationship. 

3) To go the distance, and complicated things. They are not good for just testing the waters as you usually do not have the safety of a normal relationship (being close to home, having the extra time etc.) Going back to number one: spill your guts, pour your heart out on the table. Hold nothing back. An LDR requires everything you can give and then some.

Two weeks ago, and seemed to still share many similar values and interests. In fact she told me of the many things I introduced her to all those years ago, that she still enjoys and considers her favourites... 

So on the Friday night, and the guest bedroom would be a much better option, and allow us to both enjoy a glass or two of wine.

I arrived at lunchtime, and she was very busy with accountancy exams, we had just lost touch with each other, and never really split up... We had lunch together then walked arm in arm around her home town chatting and catching up on 30 years of news. I had promised to cook her a meal, the same dish I had cooked for her on our first date, and we had fun collecting all the ingredients.

While I was cooking dinner, and we talked non stop as though we had never been apart.

That night, both of us missed having someone to cuddle in bed, so we agreed to share her bed... It was incredible.

You would imagine that after being separated for over 30 years we would have forgotten everything about each other's bodies

After I went home, but the coming weekend we are planning to spend every possible minute together. Her youngest daughter is back at Uni, while the eldest has agreed to go and visit her boyfriend, and give us some space.

Her daughters and their boyfriends were ganging up on her last weekend, which was when they were very young...

This coming weekend we are playing golf, and again, it is as though those 30 years never happened. I cannot believe it is possible for a couple who parted, albeit without actually stopping caring for each other, over 30 years ago, to pick up again as though nothing had happened. But that is exactly what has happened...

If anyone is interested

**tl:dr** Couple who never actually split up 30 years ago get back together as though nothing had happened

The sister in law was coming up with all of these different options...which might be decent if I wasn't in a relationship. We've been long distance for the entirety of our relationship and I could see it on her face when I said I can't just up and leave without him that she thought I was being juvenile and not thinking ahead.

It’s basically an exclusive instant messaging app between you and your other half. Now I know these days communication isn’t a major problem for most people now, email and the millions of other methods of communication, but this app is slightly different. On the face of it, it’s similar to using whatsapp. To me, the special thing is that it’s between two people only. When you sign up, you are paired with your other half and off you go!

With Couple you can share photos, where you touch your screen with your thumb, whilst your partner does the same and when you match up both thumb prints, you “kiss”. 2. Secret photos, you can send photos that your partner can see for 10 secs when they open it and then the photo gets deleted after its viewed and cannot be seen again (this is obviously for those intimate photos). 

Whilst everyone may not be as excited as about this app as I am or have already heard it of it

Also it’s free!

(Pictures of proposal included!)",requieminadream,78,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/ov5kx/45_year_relationship_3_years_of_it_ldr_while_shes/

I'm going to tell you a story. Hope you don't mind the length…

Nine Inch Nails put out a new album in 2007. Year Zero. You may have heard about it. What you may not have known was that there was a very intensive ARG (alternate reality game) that went along with the story of the album up until it was released.

The culmination of all the hard work was a private show for 25 Nine Inch Nails fans and their +1s.

I was fortunate enough to be one of those 25. Adrienne was the other. On the NIN web forums I announced myself, decided to meet up with me and my friend, along with her +1, her roommate.

We hit it off instantly

I ended up driving to LA every day that week to hang out with her and her friends (I lived in Ventura, we were out on the town with our friends, a little drunk, and after some great NIN karaoke, I walked her back to her place, and we kissed.

Things went smoothly for a long time. After she finished up some classes in LA, we'd cook and play games and watch movies all the time. We said our first ""I love you""'s and wow it was just amazing.

And all too fast. I graduated from college and had to make some major decisions. Adrienne couldn't stay in California anymore. It was right when the recession hit and the jobs just weren't there. She was thinking of going to Law School but couldn't afford to continue living out in California AND save up for it. She needed to move back to her home in West Virginia. I

So we packed up our boxes, we were quiet just as often, listening to one of several audio books we picked out for the drive. We stopped in Arizona, Texas (San Antonio, beautiful city at night), New Orleans (our favorite city by far), South Carolina to visit my grandparents

We were terrified at that point that it may be the last time we'd see each other, when possible.

Then she got a job that literally almost killed her. The hours were 13 hours a day

One morning she was driving... and she flipped her car. She walked away with barely a scratch and bad concussion. The car was totalled. I'd never seen a car look so ruined. Adrienne was in tears often from that, so much so that it paid for her first year of law school, but it was the most stressful time our relationship has ever suffered.

We barely spoke because of the difference in hours. She'd be sleeping when I was awake

That didn't happen though

She had two main choices...

One. Go to New York Law School. They weren't offering a scholarship

Two. Go to Loyola Law School in New Orleans. It would be significantly further away, and she could afford it.

I insisted she go to New Orleans

After a few more visits, but by this point we've learned to roll with it.

School started, you would know that this isn't like a normal college curriculum.

""What ya up to?""

""Studying.""

Always. And forever studying.

But that was okay. I began a really good job in Manhattan that paid very well. Around this time Adrienne and I were discussing me moving down to New Orleans with her, or maybe I was just not ready…

Needless to say she wasn't happy. But we moved past it. We continued along this path for a long time. We texted each other good morning every morning and we were usually the last people to speak to each other at night. Always the same routine… ""Goodnight! I love you! &lt;3 :-*"" Routine is good in situations like this.

Our typical routine consisted of:
- Good morning text
Text each other mid day… see how the other is doing… (usually we're both busy at the start of the day)
Get home and talk on iChat most of the evening… even if it's not constantly chatting
Send each other a photo of ourselves once a day. Just to have that connection.
Talk till bed time when we can
Video chat every weekend
I'd send her flowers from 1800Flowers once in a while just because

We'd visit each other every few months. I'd come for Mardi Gras, and during the summer. Every time seemed greater than the last.

There were fight along the way. Several. Some big and some insignificant. Sometimes I felt like I was being forgotten

Seriously. If I could impart one word of advice to any LDRs… NEVER GO TO BED ANGRY. Oh

Marriage started coming into the picture. We were talking about what to do after law school… what our lives would be like afterwards… and we both realized that all our images of the future had each other in them.

I began looking for an engagement ring in August

I was planning on going to New Orleans for halloween, and he helped pick me up from the airport while she was in class.

He brought me to the French Quarter

She was in total shock… ""What are you doing here? How did you get here?""

""i didn't want to wait another day."" I took her hand, I knew you WOULD be the one. Will you marry me?""

Well… Our wedding is this August in New Orleans at a local art gallery! While we're still long distance for the time being… She graduates in May and begins studying for the bar. Thankfully she's doing the studying in WV so we can see each other when possible. We're moving to DC after the wedding.

Friends… fellow LDRers… I am here to tell you that not only can long distance relationships work

I won't say I always saw where this was going

Keep it up everyone

Nearly 5 years later… I am 25 and she is 28. We are ready to begin our lives together.

Just write it on the back of the envelope

I had maybe ten pictures of her, whenever we planned on meeting up something would come up, her ex-husband wouldn't take the kids, or a work emergency, and it just continued from there. 

We told each other everything, a distraction, etc. I poured my heart into the relationship, and it just never paid off. I bought things for her kids, talked to the kids quite a bit, and I just imagined myself as a part of their family. I never thought too much about the not-seeing-each-other thing, as I figured at some point it would work out. 

It never did. I wasted two and a half years of my life on that relationship. It was depressing, and to give myself to someone new. I have a best friend who I completely love, she loves me, she wants to date, but I just can't trust anyone after that. 

So, find a way to set-in-stone a visit...or walk away. It'll hurt, it'll suck, but at the end of the day you've walked away free and clear. If not, you might end up like me, and it'll hurt way worse, and it'll fuck with your head.

1354987685.0,14i5nh,Why I am unsubscribing,KipCake,117,48,63,"When I first discovered this subreddit, and without judgement. Distance was distance. I saw flare from less than two hundred miles to several thousand.

Now? Negativity

Distance is distance is *still* distance. 

Each kind of relationship (Friends, long distance, temporary separation, coworkers, etc…) needs trust. For my specific LDR, I've found that my SO and I need to trust that despite our distance it is still us against the world. We need to trust that we can fight the struggles that come his way, my way, Superman and Supergirl. Once upon a time

I admit to being on the lucky side of a LDR. Until February 1, I'd still pity their ass sitting in that uncomfortable chair. Come February 1, we will go back to a necessary plane ride. The drive would be a little too long (Though I do plan on trying once). For the time being, we are in the same time zone, and then longest I've gone without seeing him is a whopping six whole weeks (and I feel no shame in admitting that I hated every moment of it). Hell, in November I got to see him twice! 

This subreddit has morphed from a retreat to a place I check into occasionally. There is still wonderful things posted to this place. There are still people offering support

I've had an issue that I've been struggling with for the past few weeks, which many posts have led me to believe that I'm neither worthy or welcome here. **Two** I've been afraid that by seeking support and/or advice, the end result will be an all around more despondent feeling. 

Problems are problems are problems. I have a firm belief that judging other's pain on your own subjective scale is ineffective. A child who fell and scraped their knee for the first time is probably experiencing one of the worst physical pains they will have experienced as of yet. Does that hurt worse than a broken limb? To someone who has done both, another's struggle or pain may appear trivial to someone else, but I believe they still deserve support or aid. 

As such

Messangers like [Windows Live Messanger](http://explore.live.com/windows-live-messenger)

Gmail offers [Google Video](http://www.google.com/chat/video) (not to be confused with [Google Talk](http://www.google.com/talk/))

[Tinychat](http://tinychat.com/) is a great and easy way to see eachother! Quality isn't the best
______

**Play games together (for free!)**

* [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/) 

* [Live Journal](http://www.livejournal.com/)


* [Tumblr](http://www.tumblr.com) - Great for blogging. :D You are able to use a password  so that only you and your SO are able to edit it. This allows you to leave notes and photos for each other!

He encouraged me and said there will always be easier and harder days, that you build something special through it, and to hold on to a good thing no matter what because it pays off in the end.

Some of us may have it worse than others but we don't have the right to not acknowledge the shorter distances. I only get to see my SO once an year either for two weeks or less 

To me

If someone posts something that they don't like

I liked seeing couples photos because to me. thats where I get my comfort

Being in Uni, I look at the photos and gives me a sense of hope and happiness.

Last night, we finally got to lay around and watch *Futurama* on Netflix together for a couple of hours.
