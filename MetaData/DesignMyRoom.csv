Alright

* This is the view from my door. [[Picture 1]](http://imgur.com/3dffv)
* This is the view from the alcove to the left. [[Picture 2]](http://imgur.com/tx39H)
* This is the view from the bed into the alcove. I do not use this television for anything (it doesn't even have cable). There is a sewing kit
* This is my closet. It only includes my shirts and dress things (shirts on the shelf thing
* The rest of my clothes are stored in the desk area below and to the left of my computer area. Look at picture one and it's the area that's being a bit obscured by the chair. But it is not the large alcove directly to the left of my monitors. I figured this would be a hard one to explain
___________________________________________________________

Now

* This is above the sewing kit (the alcove area) shown in picture 3. [[Picture 6]](http://imgur.com/BaTwR)
* This area is directly left of my computer setup. It is slightly full, removed, or whatever. [[Picture 7]](http://imgur.com/veeoh)
* Also
___________________________________________________________

So

* I would enjoy becoming more minimalist. I have lots of storage
* Most importantly
* I'd love just something creative. Since I have a large amount of schoolwork
* Some calming things would be cool. I already burn candles (incense is preposterously expensive). What about some [bamboo plants?]
(http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_WgF9RN2LSb0/TSpT8CM_XJI/AAAAAAAAA_4/nbBzoFDz8z0/s400/bamboo1.jpg)
* If calming won't work out
* Money is not an issue.

All entries are appreciated and have an equal chance of winning: from simple hand-drawn sketches to 3D renderings.

[I've uploaded photos

Submission deadline: **over**

Please pm me your entries.

Once the deadline is over I'll publish all the entries and choose a winner

(Disclaimer: I withhold the right not to anounce a winner if I don't like any of the designs. In that case I'll award a 25$ IKEA coupon (or equivalent) to the entry with the highest upvotes)

* Bed
* Wardrobe (or alternative clothes storage)
* Desk
* Chair
* Book shelf

(These are the essential things that I need - the rest is up to you ;-) )

What I like:

* Wooden materials: I think they are natural and timeless
* I love technology
* Traditional and masculine values - would fancy to have a flat that shouts: bachelor pad/man cave

My budget is about $300 for decorative stuff, but less expensive is better.

I cannot paint the apartment (I've asked), but I realize that it may not be possible to give my place a 'style' with the lack of painting options and the somewhat mismatched furniture I currently have. Really I'd just like to have my place feel like home and not some college place with girly posters and beer signs on the wall.

**Living Room**:

As you walk into the apartment, but i'm not sure there is enough space. There's 6 feet of space between the two when my chair isn't at my desk, and 3-4 feet when my chair is there.

[This is my desk right now](http://i.imgur.com/D4p4zvh.jpg) and I'm thinking about mounting my TV on the wall

Next to the desk, but they aren't very deep and it'd be a bit awkward with the chairs there. Right now I'm looking at [this bookshelf](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/10196431/#/10103088) from Ikea for $70, but I'm open to suggestions.

**Bedroom**:

My bedroom is pretty basic right now, or putting it in the closet. I'm open to alternate clothing storage suggestions though.

I'm looking at a couple dressers from Ikea

**Miscellaneous**:

Right now I've got this [mini-bookshelf/tv stand](http://i.imgur.com/slgiqPO.jpg) that I don't know what to do with. The only place for it at the moment is at the foot of my bed where I'm planning on putting my dresser once I get it. I could use it as a bookshelf, but if someone here has an idea of how I could use it, that'd be great.

At the moment, but I'd like to put both of them up because they both have some pretty good memories associated with them.

Thanks so much for your help and suggestions in advance!

As you see it isnt much but it's (almost) home.

I realy like the big windows and the long layout of the room.

The bedroom is about the size of Anne Franks room

The Bathroom is simple

SO my question is

These are 3 quick layouts that I just made.

2;[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/up7K3)

3;[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/06jwH)



As you can see on the pictures
I dont realy know how I should put the sofa and what kind of sofa I should buy. I realy like the L-shaped sofa's due to my lenght and I would love to look out of the window from my sofa

Since the bedroom is so small
I put it on the left side of the wall.

Looks and colour wise:
I'm realy a fan of the industrial/bachelorpad style. Old warehouses with brick walls

But since Im living in the real world and not in a massive Manhatan appartment with brick walls and massive rooms I need some good idea's to get that fibe going.

Colour wise I like Grey
I find it very difficult how to paint the room since its a long

Colour idea's: [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/uW8Pf)

As you can see the floor and the kitchen aren't realy matching the whole grey fibe

I also was thinking about applying a wallsticker somewhere to break the grey but other idea's are realy welcome!

**I am looking for advice in rearranging the furniture for the most part

You'll see the difference in styles when you look at the common room verses my bedroom. I think we did a good job of combining our tastes
     
Unfortunately the walls are kind of a drab color, but it's just too expensive.
     

The living room feels a little fragmented. We each contributed different pieces, and bookcase go together with the room. No idea what to do with the red ottoman. I bought the trunk as a coffee table but the size is awkward, so I just put it by the door and threw some pillows on it. The living room is also very drab to me, it needs more light and color. The couch especially needs some color, and I would love to add colorful throw pillows, but the back of the couch is pillows rather than cushions so that makes it difficult.
  
The dining room comes together alright but it's a little empty and unfinished looking. Curtains would do wonders I think
  
My bedroom is unfinished. Haven't had enough money to get good bedroom furniture

The Room will be completely empty

We were thinking a window seat would make the room. I drew something up on sketchup, but i feel the top is still too heavy. The 28”x12” tumor in the corner of the room is a real problem, its an exterior wall so it can’t be fixed. Drew up a small fold out desk thingy and some shallow shelves, again very preliminary. Open to better ideas.

The Hallway door leads out into the rest of the house

Closet will be empty and we don’t really need the storage its a little over 2’ deep and probably 6’ something wide. Maybe remove the door and do something else with that space? I was thinking about doing the built-in seat thing over there

Shelving wise

Bottom line is this room has been a bedroom for so long

2) USE OF SPACE I'll be using the space mostly to sleep and to retreat from the world a bit.  A desk would be a strongly desirable but not necessary feature -- perhaps a smaller stand-up desk or a multi-use piece that I could set my laptop on and sit at.

3) FEELING/STYLE I want the room to be **simple, I don't know exactly how to describe the colors I think of, just that I would stay away from more neon and very bright colors.

**""Minimalist""** is a tricky word but I think it's in the general direction of what I like.

I don't know if ""continuity"" of rooms is important

To translate this to my personal style

I am early 20s, straight, like hiking, reading, the Green Bay Packers, and more.  I work in consulting.  Two pictures of me active in two different realms: [pic 1](http://i.imgur.com/dev9A.jpg) and [pic 2](http://i.imgur.com/mvog9.jpg)

4) BUDGET My budget is flexible.  I think $2000 is a good start

-It's a 1 bedroom apartment that's 715 sq ft. I have a general idea and color scheme that I would like to stick to (gray, dining, and kitchen); like most apartments it has standard white walls and a neutral carpet. check out my pics here: http://imgur.com/a/FkiBm#0

-I'm sort of stumped when it comes to the dining area, I would like to replace the vertical blinds with curtains, replace the fixture in the dining area, and paint a few walls if I am allowed to by the management.

I'll be using the space as a bachelor. I want it to be a fine line between a bachelor's room and a hotel room. I like how hotels utilize space efficiently. The only thing else I will be doing is using my desktop.   


###How I feel about the space:
I like it the furniture a lot but I feel like it's missing something. I'd say that I like masculine rooms. I wouldn't mind a new desk or painting the one I have. Here is an album of a few rooms I found that I liked. I like the idea of not having the normal ""softer tan"" paint even if I only paint one of the four walls. The new room will definitely need better wall art. I will probably get a piece like this

As you can see, which gives the place lots of natural light, even though it's small.

The king size bed is going either against the wall to the left, I could put a large bookshelf (if there's room) along the far-left wall of the bedroom. There's also minimal closet space, so I'm going to need a dresser for sure. (In previous apartments, I just used closet-hanging cubes, but I don't think that will work here)

I have one piece of furniture that I really like, as I actually use it to listen to records, and often plug my computer into it as I like the sound quality.

Other wise

* a couch (was thinking a futon - is this a big no-no? I need somewhere for guests to stay

* bookshelves (I have lots of books - was thinking of using bookshelves as bedside-tables to double up);

* and possibly a dining area something-or-other to eat at (although space is so tight

* I also need to store my bike somewhere

I have lots of nice stuff I like to hang on the walls, but then would I put the ""dining area"" against the wall with no windows? I like walking into a welcoming space, so I feel like whatever is against the wall on the other side of the bathroom (the entrance door is right next to the kitchen, although there is a closet and tiny hallway there).

1351732774.0,12fm85,Help Design My New Apartments Living Room,1sight1,13,4,12,"Hello Guys

I need help designing my new apartments living space.

A little background first. I am 24 yr old male civil engineer that will be getting a puppy in two months. I enjoy having people over and entertaining. I have traveled a lot and have lots of pictures. I tend to lean towards more natural colors and I really have no idea what sort of ""style"" I have maybe... chic farm house or something like that.

The pictures show it in its current state. The space will be empty and the kitchen cabinets are going to be refinished white. I have no furniture so everything is going to be bought or made so links to items would be awesome. I can't change paint colors or floors or anything.

**Some of my thoughts:**

 * Projector for tv?
 * Trying to put a small table next to the counter for more eating space maybe match the height and use stools for the table?
 * I like plants and have been known to keep them alive the only plant I have right now is a 4yr Hoya
 * Have a wall feature? maybe something with fabric?
 * Area Rug?

**Needs**

 * TV and seating for 6
 * Coat rack / shoe rack by entry
 * Dog-ish safe

1351294841.0,125fdw,Would need revision on my bedroom plans / new ideas are more than welcome!,cuko,9,1,11,"Hey

&gt;i am a student (21)
&gt;My room is a constant mess for years now, i knew i could find the motivation for it, started browsing and got some good ideas, so i started planning as well.

[Here](http://imgur.com/a/bamf8)'s an album of my bedroom .(Floorplan included - i hope it's good enough

I dont know how to rearrange the furniture. I'm really bored of the current setup
Feel free to suggest me what to move where. (:    
What i think would be good to start with is to move the desk in front of the windows - ""Mehr licht!"" :). (i added two plans to the album too

**Plans**:

* find a good place for the sofa
* ""break up"" the emptiness in the middle of the room
* fix some cheap and colorful curtains on the non-book shelves (patchwork maybe?)
* buy and start a small aquarium (place not yet decided for it)
* fix the holes on the wall
* paint some narrow-ish stripes on the wall ([source of idea](http://www.sasinteriors.net/2012/02/diy-how-to-paint-stripes-and-product-review-of-u-stripe-it/))
* make a small gallery wall
* find ideas for some more DIY extras which could make me feel the room more home and mine

***
*Some additional info*:

* the wall with the many wardrobes is the ""cold wall""
* the holes in the walls were for ugly shelves disassembled long ago
* I don't use the TV
* My budget is very low
* I live in Budapest (Hungary)
* I rather keep to myself in the room
* My girlfriend's dad has a carpenters' store

***
I'm grateful


***
     
**EDIT**:    
Here's the floorplan i'm going with atm:
http://imgur.com/vWGAc

* i moved the glass-doored cabinet to my brothers' room, TV-one next to it, 1 bookcase stays in the line.
* i thought i'd like a more central place for my aquarium (i ordered an [Aquael shrimp set](http://www.aquael.pl/images/stories/0Akwarium/Zestawy_akwariowe/shrimp.jpg), and the aquarium will take its old place
* i made up my mind on getting rid of the cloth hanger
* the piano will stay in the corner, but still in an angle, not paralell)
* i moved the poang chair to my parents' room, i'll might keep the old armchair in my room
* i'll paint the stripes on the bed's wall, with white interception lines.
* above the sofa will be my gallery wall
* i also would like some more art above the piano, but looks too expensive for me (print+shipping=$$$) - **any ideas where can i find some nice HD print pictures that i can have printed?** (i like the minimalist-stencil-popartsy pics, i think they would suit the room, but all i have are some HD wallpapers - are they good enough to print in bigger size (let's say 40x60cm)?)

After removing the wardrobes from the wall
By removing all stuff and back, i'll need to organize my space better, so i think i'll need some paperboard boxes (low-budget) on the shelves.

The room is still a big mess

Problems with my room right now that I know I have to deal with somehow:

- Having a double bed, and lots of random stuff leaves almost no room for study space.
- I'm very easily distracted and as it stands I cannot associate my room with work - I want to change that.
- I would like to remove the shag carpet and replace it with hardwood - would hiring someone to do this be worth it? For what price?
- I'm also interested in repainting.
- I have a study desk from IKEA in mind

Can someone give me redesign/furniture suggestions/general renovation advice based on my criteria? All in all I need space to be utilized better and a more mature

I'm 17 and my dad is willing to help me out to an extent but he doesn't want to hire people to install the floor or paint the walls

The closing date is not scheduled until June 3rd but as that is just around the corner


The house will contain me and four other 23-24 year old guys. In our present living situation we all like to loaf around and watch TV, Sports, etc (who doesn't right?). As this is the only feasible common area for such a room in this new house I would like to work out how to make it a media room. 


Picture 1 in the gallery shows the view of this living room area from what is planned to be the dining room. 


Picture 2 shows the view from the table that is currently in the middle of the room. This is the left wall that you cannot really see in picture 1. 

Important things to note. 

- While there is a fireplace

- In the far side of picture 1 you can see a doorway that is actually the front entrance of the house. As there is a side driveway with side entrance and garage with garage entrance I do not anticipate us using the front door very often. 

- TV placement has been very hard for me to figure out. It is a long and narrow room with opposing walls being a set of windows and a fireplace. I don't really want to mount the TV above the fireplace as it is hard on the eyes and neck to view at such an extreme angle

- **TV. We currently have a 55 inch LCD flat panel TV as well as an Epson PowerLite Projector and would be willing to use either as the main TV. The projector may give us flexibility to use a screen either in front of the fireplace or in front of the windows but I would love to hear what sort of creative ideas you all come up with.

I made this post over in /r/interiordesign and would like to get as much input as I can.

I bought a house somewhat recently (scaling up from an apartment) and I have this room that I would really like to pop. However

The ""square"" portion of the room is 10' 9"" long by 10' 3"" wide. The tiny alcove leading to the door is 3' 5"" long by 3' 2"" wide.

I am honestly open to just about anything. I usually end up spending a lot of my time in here as it is where my computer is, here are my current thoughts.

The desk needs to be replaced. It was an old particleboard type desk that I picked up at a thrift store since the apartment was my first time moving away from home. I was almost thinking some sort of glass corner desk? The curtain needs to go as well.

The current light fixture in the room matches the rest of the ones in the house, I just wouldn't be sure how it would turn out in this room.

I thought about posters/art as well. My job consists of caring for reptiles and it is definitely a passion

Budget is pretty open. a max around $1000-1500? Depends where the ideas go! I appreciate your time reading this and look forward to hearing some great ideas!

It's basically the living room of the house as it is the first room you enter upon entering the house.

[Here](http://imgur.com/a/wQQG4) are pictures of the space along with a rough diagram of the layout and dimensions. The old roommate still has a few items in the house that she has to remove and please forgive the mess, classy, and largely open space where we can watch movies or do things around the floor. This is a high traffic area as people need to walk straight across the room from the entrance of the house to get to anywhere else in the house.

Here are my restrictions: 

* I don't have a lot of money. (surprise) I'd like not to spend more that $100-150 on decorating the room. We rent the place and will only be there until May. 

* I don't want to cover the air vents. (They're marked in orange boxes on my diagram) The room also only has 2 power outlets that can't be overloaded. (The house is very old and the frat boys around the corner just burned their house down from an overloaded outlet.)

* I have to use the dresser in the right of [this picture](http://i.imgur.com/zCUaf.png) to store my clothes somewhere in the room. The dresser is about 3 feet wide by two feet deep. (Don't have exact measurements available right this moment.) 

* The only seating I currently have is [this](http://i.imgur.com/uBk4t.jpg) futon. I also still have those two square rice paper floor lamps if they could be of use.

* I would like to somehow incorporate the fireplace. It is currently bricked up

* I need to set up a computer desk for my desktop and monitor somewhere in the room. I was thinking of getting an old wooden desk/table from a thrift store.

* I have a small projector that I would like to use to project movies on the large wall without windows. I was thinking of getting a large white sheet, and having that pulled taught across the center of the large open wall via screw eyes and some sisal rope. It wouldn't bee too big as the projector's got shitty 720p max resolution. (Again, I don't have any money to afford anything else and I'd prefer to use the projector rather than a TV and have to get a tv stand.

What I've got in my head so far: I imagine putting the futon directly under the window across from the large windowless wall. (This way we could sit on the futon and watch movies on the opposite wall. I would put the large dresser to the left of the futon. (Left as in if you were sitting on it.) The dresser would fit flush with that little bit of wall that juts out two or so feet into the room. I was thinking of getting my computer desk/table and putting it directly under the other window

I submitted the above post about a month ago asking for some tips and ideas on how to better use my living room space.

Everyone gave me awesome ideas and asked for an update so I wanted to deliver

--The couches are both 77 inches wide.

That one fact alone

I wanted to try for an L shape with the couches and while [one would fit on the wall with the DVD shelves](http://i.imgur.com/g6TNj.jpg)

[The wall with the TV](http://i.imgur.com/IzqHu.jpg) nothing would fit on

So with regard to the couches

What we have decided to do is:

* Get rid of the DVD/bookcase and my boyfriend is going to build shelving in that [dip in the back wall, so he has to plane it and re-cut some of the shelves a tiny bit.

* On the wall where the DVD/bookcase is now

* Paint the whole room another color.

Any suggestions on paint colors?   The only color I don't want is white.

*
*

We do have a [whole other room](http://i.imgur.com/AyLb7.png), but BF is against it.

The landlord's bed room is above that room and he doesn't want to make too much noise with the TV and video games that would disturb him, ever that loud. 

He also hates the carpet due to the fact that when our dog was young

As it stands i'm working on convincing him

The basement is unfinished save for wood flooring and a carpeted area to the right of my bed. The TV to the right and desk are not mine and there is a love seat in the foreground of the second photo. I can move the desk/TV to the other side or maybe another area of the basement. 

The area behind me is storage for the other roommates and it is a disaster. Big pile of crap. Most of the stuff on the ledge that runs around the room is also not mine. The table to the left of the bed is used as a makeshift fermentation area for beer brewing but I can clean it up a bit. The dog crate can also probably stand to do as my dog hasn't been in the crate for probably a year.

Right, but I'll start here. 

As you can see below, but am a little stuck with what to do.

I was considering, skirting board and radiators, the wallpaper in the album below on the wall behind the TV and the metallic silver (as in one of the photos) everywhere else (can't decide if it'll look amazing or awful, it could be very dark, but the reflectivity may mean not) then possibly paint the brickwork chimney gloss white.

The beams on the roof are fake and screwed into the ceiling

I like things very clean looking

Oh

There's very little colour so far (I'm mainly a fan of dark blue) but quite like the silver/black/white theme. The wallpaper was the nicest I found but would rather something more abstract than trees. In my head it's got dark dragons on

Oh, so any great ideas feel free to think of something quite out there that I could build up to! I love technology... I'll have a full stereo system and what not in there round the TV as well (along with a proper TV stand rather than a speaker cabinet! The amps will probably move downstairs).

Looking for some input...lots of info inside!,Spork2000,5,1,8,"**edit** The reason for no pictures of the actual apartment is I haven't moved in yet sorry for not making this clear. I'm trying to get some advice prior to moving in to see if there is anything I should purchase prior to my move in date (Mid July). I know this is limited information...but I was hoping you could kind of 'visualize' what I'm going for with the layout and pictures I provided below

Hey Everyone!

First off

So I'm moving in to my first one bedroom apartment in Midtown Manhattan. I already have most of my furniture

I'm going to replace and upgrade as I go...but right now I'm working with what I have.

As you'll see

If it matters

I want to paint my room and style it somewhat after [this apartment](http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/robs-flooded-with-life-small-cool-contest-190201)



So [here](http://i.imgur.com/TxhTCDs.jpg) is a layout of my apartment roughly to scale.

The couch is a black leather couch in an L shape as you can see. It's similar to [this design](http://image.ec21.com/image/carolynlong/OF0008055245_1/Sell_designer_Knoll_L_shape.jpg) but without the metal or round pillows

The bed is the [IKEA malm bed](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/S39849855/#/S79849844)
with end tables attached on to it. In black/brown

The bookcase is the [Ikea Billy] (http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/83688210/#/40071788)
in black brown

The desk is the [Ikea Malm Dresser](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/10203610/) in black/brown 

The coffe table is the [Ikea Klubbo](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/80135019/) in black brown 

The letters are where I'm going to hang my ""Art"" (I use that term loosely trust me). I have very nice black frames which I'll be putting the following pictures in

[A](http://www.allposters.com/-sp/Bloodbeat-I-Posters_i7617658_.htm)

[B](http://www.allposters.com/-sp/Bloodbeat-II-Posters_i7617659_.htm)

[C](http://www.allposters.com/-sp/Princess-of-China-Posters_i9467414_.htm)

D - Custom Graffiti style print I have. Can post a picture if you need.

The TV is a 46 inch Aquos. Seeing as it's a bit far away to view from the couch/bed with a swivel mount I'll be upgrading to a 60-65 inch eventually.

Also...I'll be hiding my desktop PC and television components in the closet next to the desk. For a cleaner look of the monitor and wireless keyboard/mouse on my desk and TV on the wall. I'll wire it all up

I'm looking for any tips on the layout

I'm also looking on how to add color. I was thinking of adding a shag rug similar to what the guy in the link I posted did and matching decorative pillows on the couch to.

[Here](http://imgur.com/a/yhfUy#7) is an album of my room how it currently is. It has very sloped ceilings and isn't very large. The carpet is a red/wine color and walls are a peanut color. The carpet was the same from when we moved in about 7 years ago and we hastily painted the walls that summer as they were purple from the previous owners.

I HATE the color scheme in my room! I want lighter colors on the walls, etc. I like beachy colors (blue, light tan, green) and don't want anything dark that would make the room look smaller.

Furniture: My current bed is a twin but I will be getting a full size bed. The green chair is being given to my brother. The giant mirror attached to the dresser is being taken down. I would like to change out the pulls/handles on my furniture. The pieces are really good quality and sturdy hardwood so I don't want to replace them

I'd really like to have a nice living room to hang out in with friends.  I want to have a comfy couch facing the fire place (that will probably also have a TV over it in the future) and enough extra seating so that I could have maybe six people hanging out.  Also,000.

Alas, ugly as they are.

Here's where I need help: I'm not even sure what style of furniture to be thinking about, I got the impression that any sofa that fits that description would simply take up too much space in the apartment.  I'm open to any suggestions about furniture layout.

I’m hoping you can help me pick a great color for the master bathroom. We’ve recently painted the bedroom [Benjamin Moore Gray Horse]( http://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us/paint-color/grayhorse) and love it. However, but I’m concerned it might not work with the current color scheme. The bathroom has cherry vanities and a bit of orange tile work to throw in the mix. I did try using the Sherwin Williams tool from the sidebar, but without much love.

Primarily, I'd like to keep the bathroom bright, so lighter colors are preferred.

I’ve posted some pictures from a few different angles – sorry for the quality

I got in, under certain terms: We have a color pallet to keep ourselves to and it can't seem like all we do is play videogames all day. They hinted for a retro arcade/8bit theme. Which is probably the best option. The color pallet is really wide ranged, and our school is indeed pretty colorful. They have a wall full of pokemons in a room above ours.

The last photo is of the southern face of the room to show the pitch of the roof


Skill-wise, though I don't want to get into structural changes (but stuff like electricity, pulling new wires, and rerouting the radiator are all well within our capabilities.  

Budget-wise, but I've never worked with raw leather before, so I don't know what issues I'd run into there.

The reason I mention it's unusual  layout is because I'm thinking of switching the flow of the house in an unconventional way. 

The main area of the house is very open. The kitchen is open, no mudroom. Just opens up and boom, there's the tv, couch, coffee table, welcome in.

I hate that the computer and living space are separated by the dining table. But we can't move the computer desk into the living space because of the space constraints/not wanting to put a desk in front of floor-to-ceiling windows.

**HERE'S MY IDEA:**

I want to put the dining space in the smaller, sketch of the [current layout](http://i.imgur.com/H2hc84y.png) (pretending that my kitchen is finally remodeled), and a sketch of the [way I'd like to lay it out instead.](http://i.imgur.com/iFBAkoX.png)

Once you've seen the sketches

* The big couch. It has to go. It was great when we first got it

* The dining table is really more like my sewing table/my husband's D&amp;D table.. I keep most supplies out of sight (can't leave them out unless I want some cats up in that biz) and really the dining area is like a dining/multi-use space. Right now it's all up in the computer's biz.

* We use the computer for television JUST AS MUCH as we use the television. I *hate* watching our shows at the dining table/from a distance. I want the swap mainly so it will be the entertainment space all in one area.

* The kitchen is still very open. The 12"" deep cabinets lined up against the kitchen counter are 40"" high

Thoughts? All CCW welcome

At the moment we have two paints

The room's size is around 160 sq ft and it's a bit rectangular.

The bed I will be bringing in is a full-sized bed with a headboard, and will most likely be buying a black L shaped desk (know the infamous ikea L desk?) or at least an L shaped desk of some sort. I will also have my [fender guitar](http://www.amazon.com/Squier-Fender-BulletStrat-Brown-Sunburst/dp/B001L8NFZW/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368937389&amp;sr=8-6&amp;keywords=fender+electric+guitar) and AMP outside at all times. I MAY get a a drawer or something like that if the closet can't fit all of my clothes (which it might not). Oh and the closet's kind of a mess but I'll post that separately after fixing up the room first.

Basically most of my furniture will be black of sorts.

The floor will most likely remain that way (just varnished) or I might get laminated flooring installed. The shade of the wood will remain about as light but the width will definitely be thicker.

**I would like a minimalist look. I'd basically like suggestions on just about everything. From placement, etc.**

[3](http://i.imgur.com/6edT6Kz.jpg)






This room has to be extremely functional, working space, as well as for entertaining (which we do a lot of). So it needs to have lots of seating, as well as a surface to eat/work at (we are currently using an Ikea desk which we cannot wait to replace!). We also have a record player and stack of records which do not currently have a piece of furniture to house them, or a space for that furniture, so they need to be accounted for as well. 





Aesthetically, classic items as accessories. I know that's a bit vague, so here is the [bedroom](http://i.imgur.com/A4V6lRC.jpg) for comparison (the deer skull has since been mounted above the bed). 





Our budget is super small





Any suggestions you may have about layout/pieces/colour scheme/style for the room would be greatly appreciated. The room needs a complete overhaul

I want to kind of work with that, I was thinking a cowskin like this: http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/60222932/ and then a coffee table of some kind. I want to get some ferns and things like that, I just don't know about the layout of the room, hard for me to get a feel for. The problem is that the bookshelf in the back corner is built into the wall so that kind of inhibits what I can do with the room, as well as the cellar doors, and the back door, they all need a little room. You can kind of see that all in the pictures. I have a surround sound system with 6 speakers and a TV stand that needs to go somewhere

The kitchen is basically fine the way it is

Upstairs there are 3 rooms, the back bedroom (room with bed and closets) and bathroom. I didn't include pictures of the bathroom because it's pretty much set the way it is, no problems there. 

The front bedroom definitely needs seating of some kind, something. I was going to get a carpet for it as well. Not sure. The bookshelf that is in there is not staying.  

The back bedroom, put casters on it and use it for record storage and put a turntable on the top of it, for bedroom listening. Other than that, some art, plants, not sure what to do.

I currently live in Hong Kong the apartment so apartments are a way of life.. It's a 30 year old apartment block.. and I will be living there with my gf.

I'm a bit confused as to how I should be addressing my furniture. Especially with two types of wood that seem to dominate everything....

* Should I be picking items that are more neutral like white/grey/black to draw away from the heavy impact of wood in the house? 

* Or should I be choosing vibrant colors to contrast the wood? 
* Or...?

I would love your 5 cents please advise me on how I should be purchasing my furniture.. I will probably be buying most articles if not all from Ikea so if you have a particular piece of furniture in mind please feel free to link. Whatever advice though whether it be color schemes

Thanks :D!

As the title says, well, hopefully a year.

My parents decided that in between me moving out and moving back in, but I'm only keeping it in my room because there's nowhere else to put it; it's leaving eventually, I think.

I like a modern living space, weightlifting, and paintball (the black duffel bag you'll see).  I really like the look of Ikea furniture, but they seem all about storage space, whereas I don't like storing things.  Everything that's in the room is what I own, but I'd say at least half of what's in there is going (donating, yard sales

So

http://imgur.com/a/MkkBW#11  I linked to one of the photos in the album because that's the floor plan.  It's crudely drawn by myself (1/4"" = 1ft if you can see the grid markings, the one to the left is a closet, and to the right is a bathroom.  On the right-hand side wall from this image, there is a glass door leading outside.  On the left, there is a bay window.  Finally, the wall opposite the door has a space just wide enough for the bed to fit in, so I kept it that way.  Of course

Note about the clutter: if it's on top of a surface

Now, putting an entertainment center for the TV.  The couch is broken, though, so it's not staying, but we already used our ""large item pickup"" this month so it's just in my room for now.  The ""Matrix"" poster is also leaving, but I have a framed photograph that's going there.

If you're facing the window, no room anywhere else yet.  I was thinking [something simple like this](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/00185584/), or maybe some hanging shelves above a wooden plank attached to the wall.  The shelves would just house a tub or two of protein, maybe 5-6 alcohol bottles, some glasses and my shaker cups.  Adjacent to that (whichever wall the bar isn't on) I'm thinking of hanging a painting I have.

The shelves under the window fit pretty nicely and I have my games on the right hand side (top shelf) and my protein/supplement stuff on the bottom shelf along with a couple office supplies.  To the right of the shelves is just stuff for eBay.  I don't sell on eBay that much so I don't want a dedicated space

My computer desk is where I spend a lot of my time and wow I just realized how awful that towel looks on the chair

So, the bookshelf is half-empty (or half-full, depending on how you look at it).  I could pack most of those away, but that just leaves me with even less in the room.

I can't paint the walls and the rug is a strange brownish color (which I didn't pick)

What I need you guys for is advice on what colour I should paint the walls which would look good with the current furniture colours and the white top border.

Okay

**About Me:** Single 20-something full-time engineer. Enjoys heavy metal music, but also like to maintain a sense of personal style and am very much into organization. Also, I’m only 5’7” tall, so having tall things in the room doesn’t seem like my style. Style Finder says I’m “Classic Casual, aka Transitional – A mix of contemporary and traditional. Usually updated, graceful, and enduring.” My favorite color is dark blue, I'm no longer adamant about keeping it.

**About My Room:** Planner 5D link above is fairly accurate to the room; yes, so most of the walls will be made of plaster (?) rather than drywall; I was told it’s probably not a good idea to hang heavy things from nails on the walls. 

Ceiling is only 82 inches

**Add’l Furniture:** Existing furniture includes a standard queen bed, [2](http://goo.gl/XHlIA), [3](http://goo.gl/g3gxy), [4](http://goo.gl/WWjsT), [5](http://goo.gl/bQEKT)).

**Bed:** I ordered a sheet set because the current one, I welcome your thoughts:  http://goo.gl/hCH2s

**Curtains:** Something like these; could definitely use help in picking color

**Décor:** Definitely looking for some posters/art to fill the room; I’m particular to things like engineering drawings and retro/“vintage” pieces

* 96"" long. Can be longer; Willing to take them somewhere to get them shortened if absolutely necessary. 

* Would prefer sheers over thick curtains so that the living room will be brighter.

* Preferably a style similar to [these](http://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/product.asp?SKU=114830&amp;RN=129&amp;); I don't like anything overly fancy and I prefer curtains with grommets. These would be absolutely perfect if they had them in the right color. :(

* I'm mostly looking for a solid color

* [This](http://www.cb2.com/pillows/rugs-and-pillows/saudades-magenta-18x12-pillow/f8667) is one of the magenta throw pillows I'll be getting

* Must be able to be purchased online and shipped to the US (preferably without crazy cross country shipping costs).

**Option Two:** 

I'm also willing to take suggestions on a different color that would go well with the orange. I've tried out a few combinations and I just can't seem to find anything that doesn't clash with the orange. I never thought I'd be painting an accent wall orange

4. I like minimalist cabinet design that serve multi purposes.  
5. Like minimalism - not too many
6. Like the bamboo window shades.  
7. Like plants inside the house.  

I understand these may not all go well with each other. 
I'd like suggestions on placement

I have these gaudy/dorky dragon lamps that I want to hang in my new condo. Since they seem like a big commitment - As in

Does anyone have an opinion? (Yes I know the lamps are a bit odd but I'm mostly looking for placement opinions not just ""don't put them up they're weird.."" So I appreciate any thoughts! Here are some photos.  

I have 4 lamps. I want to put 2 above the couch with a tapestry between them. Here is how our couch is set up.  

http://i.imgur.com/rHSdgUq.jpg  

The lamps and tapestry would be centered above the couch - not on the wall. Does this seem visually appealing? I feel like the right side of my wall near the door will seem empty and off center.  

The other two I am stuck on bc my idea doesn't seem to want to work:  

Here is a panorama from one side of the room

B is the same lamp above the right side of the couch, where I wanted a lamp.

Here is a closer photo of the two lamps C &amp; D from the panorama. D seems ok

http://i.imgur.com/JSw3id7.jpg  

We have a tight fit bc of our couch to enter our place and living room. And the lamps have a shorter cord than I thought. Excuse my BF in his PJs- I made him get up from a nap. He is 6ft. So as you can see

I really wanted all 4 lamps in our living/dining room area

Here are a couple ideas:  
Hallway: http://i.imgur.com/Wj18dox.jpg (this is the dark hallway in the panorama photo

Flanking the kitchen entry http://i.imgur.com/3Fv1H5N.jpg  But we already have a big chandelier lighting that area. And I don't like the kitchen so it seems weird having lamps flank my crappy kitchen.

I have a decent idea of what I want to do (maybe) but there is so much awesome here I thought I might check in here. 

I am wanting a cool and comfy space for about 4 or 5 nerds. There will be a larger open area and two small offices. (see floorplan). 

The building has some cool features. Exposed brick (needs cleaning

*Floorplan: http://imgur.com/1p19V
*Pictures: http://timfixit.imgur.com/ 

The doors to the office area are not there yet. You can see in one of the office photos there are some 2x4s in a plaster wall.. those will come out. I am thinking that wall will have two glass doors with dark aluminum frame (and windows to the rest of the office). Doors kinda like [this]. (http://www.northliteglass.com/media/images_upload/product/commercialresized.jpg?rand=898931614) 
with maybe a tall thin vertical window next to it. 


The office on the right won't have any windows. Since the ceilings are tall (12.5f') I was going to put about 4-5 1x1 windows in the wall between the two offices. This way the ""inside"" office will get some light from the windows in the neighboring office

Since the non-brick walls are plater

I was thinking this for the [hard wood floors](http://www.houzz.com/photos/125447/Montaigne-Collection-Charleroi-Wood-Floors-eclectic-wood-flooring-other-metro) . 

For the two radiators -- paint them black. For the window trim and trim around the doors -- maybe white? 

I am going to drywall the ceiling and put in some recessed lights and track lighting. Probably two long strips per area running north to south in the floor plan image (?). 

There is an old archway to other offices (its been walled over on both sides) you can see in one of the photos. There is some old duct work that is not being used that goes through the wall where the archway is.

As this is the oldest part of the building the floor is also about 6 inches lower than the rest of the building when you come through the door. So I will probably build a little wood platform to step down on to (just one step) when you step through the door.

This office space won't be for clients or anything.. it is going to be a super comfy collaboration space with whiteboards and probably bean bag chairs and some desks. 

I have some old steelcase desks that will probably work well in here

The brick I intend to clean with a wire brush and then sponge it down and seal it with some type of low lustre compound to help keep the dust down. 

I will be happy to post ""after"" photos when I finish. In several months. 

What do you guys think? Houzz.com has been a good source of inspiration but I wish it was easier to find comparable commercial spaces on there :)

Here is an album of pictures of the game room:

The first few pictures are mine

All of the furniture that you see is from my old apartment and I would like to replace it with nicer things.

1. The Couch. I'm thinking about going with a sectional like the previous owners had. Any objections? Color suggestion?

2. Entertainment Stand. The one pictured is from IKEA and I'd like to get something that doesn't scream apartment/dorm room. The speakers are staying though

3. In the original owner's pictures you can see a bar in the one corner

4. I loathe the fabric on the bench area. Any suggestions there? There is storage underneath.

5. Other furniture. Should I go for end tables and a coffee table or just one type? It's not pictured very well

6. Artwork. I'm pretty lost here, so it's special. 

One idea I did have was to get prints like these
http://cityprintsmapart.com/ballparks/pnc-park/

I'm a big fan of music too and the other idea I had was to get concert prints

Etc... That door on the wall to the left of the TV just leads to storage. The first picture was taken from the doorway that leads to the rest of the basement. The lights have dimmers.

1. What wall color walls could possibly match my maroon floor tiles? Here are a few color samples I picked up. I want a lighter color. Feel free to suggest colors that are not here!

2. For my new bed
Any suggestions for bedding? 

3. I want a big rug to add coziness but I can't think of a rug color that would match my floor tile color. Suggestions?

4. I like my dresser in general but it has this weird cork board panel that I really don’t like. [See?](http://i.imgur.com/sFchZSi.jpg) How can I make it look better? I was thinking of getting a picture the size of the panel and sticking it there. 

5. I really need to bring in some sort of desk to study on. I don’t need a lot of space just a surface to put my laptop on and preferably with some space to store books in. I have no idea where I would place a desk though. I was thinking maybe if it’s high enough I could put it against the air conditioning thing on the window wall since I never really use the AC and probably never will.

6. I really want to get an Audrey Hepburn picture enlarged and framed to hang on one of my walls. Still unsure of what picture to use

I have no clue what to do with all of these clothes.

I train Capoeira, especially since I do a lot of hand stands and other stuff against the wall and they'll be getting dirty, lol.

**In addition to the living room area I also need to have:**

* a workout area with a punching bag and rings

* some open floor space to move around (for dance/capoeira)

* my home office (I work from home and want a pretty decent sized desk)

* a dining table that can be converted to a poker table

I'm not sure how I want to arrange everything but right now I'm thinking of trying to keep the workout stuff in my bedroom. This would including painting a wall with chalkboard paint to keep workout data on there and other notes. I'm considering where to put the office: in the living room area or in the alcove next to the kitchen? Or should I put the poker table in the alcove?

I would love to do something cool in the hallway. Wood would be awesome

My plan is to come up with a two-tone paint palette for the living room (currently thinking something green and gray) and a separate two-tone for the bedroom (maybe something blue and gray).

I think the kitchen looks good as long as the kitchen cabinets are an actual timber veneer and not melamine made to look like it. If so the easiest change to make to the kitchen down the track is to the cupboard fronts rather than the benchtop. They will all be standard size so an easy thing to swap out. There are loads of modular kitchen companies around who do parts of a kitchen and not the whole thing and they can provide good advice on colour/finish etc. For the lounge and bedroom I suggest you look at some on pinterest (you dont need to be registered to use it) and collect all your favourites together - that will give you a good idea of what aesthetic direction you want to head in - eg: colour,,False,,t5_2ux9b,False,,True

Moving into my first apartment the second week of July. (Stoked) And need some help laying out the living room.

I plan on getting a couch, and which follow a basic size. &lt;edit to add&gt; The chair is oddly faced, but the fact that behind it opens to a hallway and dining room really opens up possibility to turn it and not be an issue.

How does this look?

Hey guys
* http://imgur.com/a/WNgVU#s1FO02d
* The first 4 are from before; the rest is current.
* Dropped about $250 total so far.
Some background info you might need to take into consideration:
* I'm 21(m) and in college.
* I live in Hawaii
* Any insight on what college girls might like that will set me apart from other guys.
* I have already invested into my bed (memory foam
* try to keep everything below ~$500 lol

Here's a few questions I have: 

1: So I guess I'm allowed to hang things on my wall for now (the wall is stucco) so any opinions? obviously I cannot afford really expensive art.  I was thinking about grabbing this http://25.media.tumblr.com/971a4faae6a28dbe1384c0b3eafc7509/tumblr_miw449hRcy1qbs6i5o1_1280.jpg or if that is too much than maybe http://wallpoper.com/images/00/23/85/54/abstract-deviantart_00238554.jpg ? since a huge picture frame would be extremely expensive

2: I removed the beer and shot glasses off the drawers
