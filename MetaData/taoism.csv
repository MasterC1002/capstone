    Do you think you can take over the universe and improve it?

    The universe is sacred.

    If you try to change it

1373534708.0,1i2k22,A concrete example of the usefulness of defeat,Bossman5000,51,6,19,"When my son reached the age that he was able to misbehave, so it was time to introduce discipline.  Although my primary motivation was that he learn to behave well

So I started to discipline him.  When he refused to wash his hands, ""do it now.""  At first he would do it, but then he wanted to test it, and would say, ""No.""  At this, I knew it was imperative to stand my ground at all costs.  So I would repeat my command, and when he did not obey, adopt a still harsher tone

When he began to cry I would feel bad and let him out

But then before long he began to cry all the time

The first time I did this was very hard for both of us.  He cried and screamed vehemently for 45 minutes, which was horrible for him.  He went home to his mother's house that night, and the next day when I saw him he soon began crying for no reason.  I put him in timeout and it did not last so long.  ""The wave is passing,"" I thought.  

Hard is it was for both of us,"" I told myself, ""but that is what the battle of parenting is all about.  Good parenting is difficult to achieve precisely because of this difficulty--any parent can be soft and succumb to the will of their child in order to keep them happy in the moment.  This is the emotionally easy, lazy thing to do.  But the child will grow up without self-discipline (or good sleeping habits, or good eating habits, or good health) and live a miserable life as an adult.""  ""No,"" I said to myself

But when we went out that day he was still in a sad mood, which worsened both of our moods.  Moreover, he started behaving badly in new ways, refusing to wash his hands after using the bathroom, and starting to wet himself every time we went out.  My response was to be ever more firm, and to adopt an angry tone even when I did not feel angry, and give longer timeouts

I started to become totally frayed.  I wanted to go back to how things were before, and would, for the most part, behave well without being told to.  I woke up one morning and said to myself, ""I will bring the fun back, I will cook him french toast with as much syrup as he wants, then take him out to the park

But he wanted the battle to continue immediately.  His french toast brought no joy and he threw it to the ground, but now it was a battle to get him to do either.  So I put on my angry face as I knew I had to do, and put him in timeout alone in his room.  And he started to cry even louder.

And my heart broke.  All of my concerns about his discipline, so I let him out and gave him a hug.  I realized instinctively that I had introduced too much anger, frustration, and sadness into our relations.  At first this anger was just a ruse, a tool which I somehow thought necessary for him to believe that I meant what I said, but it had since become real and now it was a flame lit in both of us, and moreover it was a flame that I was trying to put out with *more* fire.  My heart told me, that I needed to put the fire out immediately on my end.

So I dropped it, he did not believe them and this upset me.  But I held back and let him down as he wanted.  I placed no demands on him and just let him do as he pleased.

But still the problem remained.  Still he was defiant and refused to do even the smallest thing.  So when he had gone to the bathroom and refused to wash his hands, I sat him down on the bed, held him gently in place, and stared off into space.  I simply turned off all of my reactions.

And he screamed, and I sat with him quietly.  I let him get out all of his frustrations at me without even a hint of anger or frustration emanating from myself.  He could do as he pleased, the only rule was that he could not get up from timeout until timeout was over.  

When it ended I brought him back to the sink and asked him to wash his hands again.  Again he was defiant, that he can either wash his hands or have more timeout.  He chose more timeout and so we went again to timeout together.  This time he did not cry so much as scream at me in anger.  I sat quietly and allowed him his anger, and did not return it.  I saw it, rather, as my job to absorb his anger.  The only rule was that he had to sit in timeout until timeout was over.  But timeout had nothing to do with us.  Gradually it began to feel as though timeout came from somewhere else, from above maybe.

When timeout was over, he decided to do it.  For the rest of the day I needed to use more timeouts to get him to do things.  But they were no longer painful.  For him they were simply a nuisance.  More importantly, they no longer represented a personal battle against me.  Timeout became, rather, a dull, empty event.  Reasoning, negotiation

The next day he needed only two timeouts.  The next two days, the fun came back, because our battle was over.

**Moral:**  I introduced a needless element into my discipline, because I had already framed discipline as a form of battle in my mind, which then made it a battle in reality.  It was not until my heart broke through to me that I was willing to lose the battle, at which point it ended.  But this moment of apparent defeat was actually the destruction of a superfluous and harmful construction of my own mind.  The collapse of this mental construction made the superfluousness and harmfulness of the anger it gave birth to immediately apparent to my heart, even though my mind could not rationalize it at the moment.  As a result, a more humane and effective form of discipline naturally arose, and my son and I reestablished our former state of harmony.",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/taoism/comments/1i2k22/a_concrete_example_of_the_usefulness_of_defeat/

I have been mostly camping out at free spots in order to save money.  One of the spots is in Cherokee National Forest in Eastern Tennessee.  I was doing a bit of walking along the creek before setting up my tent.  Although I didn't really feel lonely before
 
So I wander for an hour or so - my feet are starting to get sore, zig-zagging around on the path.  I realize - the butterfly is a solitary creature, yet lives beautifully and with the Tao.  Also, the butterfly travels around rather chaotically - never on a linear way.  This observation was highly insightful, so I veer off the path a bit to write a poem about this.

I quickly realized that it was largely because I was travelling solo that I had seen the butterfly and had the insights.  Otherwise

Approximately 30 seconds later, I hardly ever see them - much less one so close up!  At this point, I start shedding tears of joy, really thinking I was in a dream or something (I was not... I think!).

Ok so I have read the Tao of pooh, but the main thing iv been thinking about is the Wu-Wei. At first glance, it sounds like it means don't do anything at all, and let what happens happen, in the way it wants to happen. That seems like a very un productive way to live. By productive I mean connected with anything. Essentially just laying in bed doing nothing. Then after applying to things such as playing an instrument it seemed like even less of a way of doing anything. No action means no learning and no progress. What's the point of even playing? Then after reading the second chapter of Tao Te Ching, it came to me. The sage acts with out expectations, and accomplishes without abiding in her accomplishments. Then with ""just being""ness of the uncarved block, and many other aspects, do not play to impress, I will improve"". When I ask my friends how they preform so well
""just do"" sounds like doing something you don't enjoy

Conquer the mind
In activity and quietude
There is no thing; whom else do you seek?
Real constancy should respond to people;
In responding to people
When you don't get confused
When your nature is stable
When energy returns
In the pot pairing water and fire.
Yin and yang arise
Everywhere producing the sound of thunder.
White clouds assemble on the summit
Sweet dew bathes the polar mountain.
Having drunk the wine of longevity
You wander free; who can know you?
You sit and listen to the stringless tune
You clearly understand the mechanism of creation.
The whole of these twenty verses
is a ladder straight to heaven.”

&gt;
&gt;Ryokan later dubbed himself Taigu, but his way of life is an entirely emancipated one. He lives on playing, so to say, with his destiny, liberating himself from every kind of fetter.' He went on to describe his disciple’s simple life: 'In the morning he wanders out of his hut and goes God knows where and in the evening loiters around somewhere. For fame he cares nothing. Men’s cunning ways he puts out of the question.'

**In My Youth I Put Aside My Studies**

    In my youth I put aside my studies 
    And I aspired to be a saint. 
    Living austerely as a mendicant monk
    I wandered here and there for many springs. 
    Finally I returned home to settle under a craggy peak. 
    I live peacefully in a grass hut
    Listening to the birds for music. 
    Clouds are my best neighbors. 
    Below a pure spring where I refresh body and mind; 
    Above
    Free
    I never want to leave! 


***


**No Mind**

    With no mind
    butterfly;
    With no mind
    the blossoms.
    Yet when flowers bloom
    comes;
    When the butterfly comes
    flowers bloom. 


***

**Midsummer**

    Midsummer -- 
    I walk about with my staff. 
    Old farmers spot me 
    And call me over for a drink. 
    We sit in the fields 
    using leaves for plates. 
    Pleasantly drunk and so happy 
    I drift off peacefully 
    Sprawled out on a paddy bank. 



***


**At Dusk**


    at dusk
    i often climb
    to the peak of kugami.
    deer bellow
    their voices
    soaked up by
    piles of maple leaves
    lying undisturbed at
    the foot of the mountain. 


***



**Like the Little Stream**

    Like the little stream 
    Making its way 
    Through the mossy crevices 
    I
    Turn clear and transparent. 



***

**Yes

    Yes
    Living among trees and plants.
    Please don’t question me about illusion and enlightenment --
    This old fellow just likes to smile to himself.
    I wade across streams with bony legs
    And carry a bag about in fine spring weather.
    That’s my life
    And the world owes me nothing.

1335551973.0,svnss,Tao Te Ching : Chapter of the day [46] Contentment ,mysterion12,34,5,4,"When the world yields to Dao


There is no sin greater than desire. There is no misfortune greater than discontent. There is no calamity greater than acquisitiveness. 


Therefore to know extreme contentment is simply to be content. 




Interpretation:

It is sometimes surprising how many people have never examined what and why they desire.  For example, will immediately and consistently tell you what is wrong, with them, with the weather, with the world.   Since they tend to always respond this way, they must have some desire.  They must be seeking some gratification.  But what?  And why?

This chapter is perhaps the most accessible to the western mind.  It begins with an observation of social behavior and then personalizes it.

The first stanza observes that horses can serve prosperous ends when Dao is followed but destructive ends when it is not.  

The second stanza states clearly that it is desire

The third stanza might be interpreted as ""contentment comes from being happy for no reason.  always we want things, the better job.   How do we feel when we are experiencing a simple pleasure?   petting the dog?  Combing long hair slowly?   Is it possible to feel content simply for the sake of feeling content without any stimuli?

When Siddhartha meets the Buddha, Buddha was a great man and his followers are good people, but Siddhartha could not accept the teachings because something was just wrong with the idea of using words to teach, having someone share wisdom when wisdom cannot be shared directly. I felt this same way when studying the major religions of the world. Had I not encountered Buddhism, my discontent with some of its beliefs never would have led me to the Tao (in this book, they say Atman).

When Siddhartha goes to a river and becomes a ferryman’s assistance

The final chapter is extraordinary. Siddhartha says that wisdom cannot be shared through words, picks up a stone and remarks on its beauty (the uncarved block). “The world is never incomplete or on its path to completeness. It is complete at every moment.” His old friend who hears these words does not understand them, thinks they are strange, and Taoists know exactly why that is.

Some people say it is simply emotion--happiness, or [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGxNnnXTvKs) radiohead song, seem to do more than merely provoke a raw emotion.  It is more like they directly communicate some deep aspect of reality, something which cannot be expressed in words or understood in any other way.  

Another way to describe it is that it gives birth to something new inside of you which soaks deep in little rivulets as the song progresses, and bring it to life.

But it is not only music which brings about such unspeakable experiences.  Both commonplace experiences like a quiet moment of eye contact with your child, music is actually just an imitation of what these moments produce.  Happy or sad, good or evil, one should probably try to listen closely.

Many people, however, that this is something which cannot be learned from philosophy or religion.  It is, perhaps, truly without words, but not inaccessible.  Rather, it is something we come to understand over time, as we listen to our experiences.  And death teaches the final lesson.  Perhaps it feels something like spinning plates.

I love the ideas behind the Tao though

Anyway, opening my mind to new things. Suppressing desire has actually been quite effective as well (instead of 'wanting' to lose weight, just get on the treadmill and do it. This skips the bad emotions that comes with desire/lust, at least it does for me).

One example of how Taoism has changed me: Yesterday I went to a place called ""Grant's Farm"". It is Ulysses S. Grant's private farm, incredible exotic life I'd never see in my back yard.  The pleasure of sitting in a chair and just *absorbing* the atmosphere of a restaurant. It was a great experience and I felt ""at peace"" and that nothing could truly bother me.

One quirk I have is that, terribly nervous beforehand.  This has happened to me for that last 4 years for no discernible reason. This morning, on facebook I saw that my ex was attending a grad party that I also planned on attending. My stomach dropped out from under me and I just sat there saying ""No, no. . . ."" Then I sat up, said ""chill the fuck out bro. Think of the Tao."" And before my rational mind even began processing exactly what I meant by that, I was already calm and no longer nervous.  So what if she is there?  There's no point resisting. I'll see her and nothing bad will happen.  She won't make me feel terrible because *I'm over her*.  Tons of my friends will be there and interacting with her will most likely be short and for the most part sweet.  If not, it's another life experience I can take with me. 

Questions/comments are welcome.

P.S. I probably won't get into any kind of meditation techniques, a true religion of peace. That sounds wonderful to me.  

P.P.S. I purchased ""The Tao of Pooh"" and eagerly await its delivery.

He looks at the things he ought to look at, and neglects those that need not be looked at. So clever a judge of horses is Kao, that he has it in him to judge something better than horses.'

Some people have said that reading Taoist texts and inserting Christian terms elicits more or less the same teachings as the Bible.

I think there is a very important

Certain churches within Christianity teach of ""total depravity, but in your natural state you aren't even able to see or appreciate the nature of God and his goodness (which you could equate ""the Tao""). Only through great effort and renouncement of your old, flawed self can you even get an idea about the good that exists in the realm of God, which is separate from ours. Christianity draws a very clear line between the true, real good that God does and the futile attempts at virtue that are the best efforts of man. (The specifics of this are as many as there are churches within the Christian faith, and the conversations are ongoing.)

Taoism shows the individual as having a totally different relationship to the world, always a participator in all things from the lowest levels of complexity to the very highest. But more importantly, it requires no great effort on your part to know and feel that this is true. In fact, the more you try to see it, the harder it is to see.

1368817239.0,1ej8fg,Pretty alarming concerns over a teacher I have trusted for almost a year,taoaway,23,1,30,"So, he is as qualified to teach as anyone else could be. He is from a monastery in China and has been teaching for over 20 years.

Anyways, for 8 months. In the course of these 8 months I've learned all sorts awesome qi gong and tai ji, taoist concepts and even some taoist medicine. However I've started to notice certain things that don't quite line up with the teachings on kindness, mercy and forgiveness that drew me to taoism in the first place. 

1. His harsh methods. Ordinarily in everyday interaction, kind and gracious. However he is quite harsh to students that are closer to him. I have seen him publicly shame his top disciple/teacher for inconsequential occurrences such as forgetting to open the flu for the fireplace in the room we train in. The feeling of overwhelming shame that washed over her in that moment left me feeling very uncomfortable, and I was so sorry for that poor student in that moment. As well, he has singled out another close student of his and called his tai ji ugly multiple times in the same training session. After that session I approached him and asked him about the ordeal. He said that our teacher was being so hard on him because he is the worst in the class and needs to improve. He saw it as a good thing. I tried to remember believing that I was the ""worst"" at something, like when I was a child learning something, and the feeligns I managed to invoke were not health-promoting. The way I see it for myself, and this is my own opinion and nothing more, in his interactions with myself and others

Keep in mind as the class started our teacher made a comment about how he can see our whole lives through our tai ji, and I know it wasn't out of love. When he picked me up from soccer, when he fed me, when he provided warmth and safety for me, that was out of love. His beatings were out of frustration and anger, out of liver qi with no root due to his alcoholism. This supposed priest is justifying abuse and it makes me uncomfortable.

2. He is preferential to the women that visit our class, without getting into specifics, I recently learned some things about his personal life that seem to match up with facilitating these behaviors.

3. He is asking for money to fund a very expensive project worth millions of dollars while he himself lives in, sparking this dilemma inside myself. I feel weird donating money to someone who clearly doesnt need it. He owns so much property, so many overseas business worth millions of dollars, etc., it makes me wonder why I would ever not give money to someone on the side of the road begging for change if I have money to spare for this guy. He clearly does not need it but he is soliciting funds for this project. It just smacks of all the other spiritual gurus out there that preach charity and simplicity yet lead lavish lives for themselves and don't give as much as they could or encourage others to. 

I don't know what to do. Am I overinflating these concerns? I don't even want to begin to confront him on this stuff. I would prefer to do nothing other than withdraw and give no explanation. I just need to hear someone else' thoughts.

I was meditating a few nights ago. My personal form of meditation is an odd sort of blend of mindfulness meditation (to promote calm and tranquility) as well as psychonautic (receiving visions or experiences through exploration of my own psyche). I have had a number of experiences through meditation that qualify as any and all of the following:

* Out of Body Experience
* Wake-Induced Lucid Dreaming
* Astral Projection
* Spiritual Journey

With this backstory out of the way, mind gently calming, I realized that my tactile sensations were subtly fading. It felt as though my arms and legs were going numb, but similarly, it felt as if they were being encompassed by something. I became aware of what exactly was ""around"" me. Every molecule of air brushing against my skin, I discovered, was inherently no different in shape or size than the molecules present in my cells. It was as if my physical body was leaving my mind behind, with some of my body still relatively sensitive, not unlike the Taoist ""Spiritual Cosmonaut"" idea of a spirit leaving its body to explore outside its vessel.

After some time, and I stood, stretched, and went to bed. I simply wanted to share all this to see if any fellow Taoists have had a similar experience, or could provide some sort of alternative perspective / additional knowledge of what I went through myself. Thank you all for listening. ^

Taoism is quite the opposite!

Individualists believe in exerting their will upon the world. How does this compare with Taoist words?

""He allows things to come and go.""

Taoism repeatedly states very non-individualistic concepts:

""Can you love people and lead them
without imposing your will?
Can you deal with the most vital matters
by letting events take their course?""

From Wikipedia:
Individualism is the moral stance, or social outlook that emphasizes ""the moral worth of the individual"". Individualists promote the exercise of one's goals and desires and so value independence and self-reliance while opposing external interference upon one's own interests by society or institutions such as the government.

While certainly, there is confusion to equate that with individualism. While an individualist would promote their ideas, morals and goals upon the external world, the Taoist would not interfere, would let the world be what it is.

Without experience, we may never see these positive traits. On the other hand, when we notice a petite, quiet woman in our midst, we may allow our guard to fall, becoming complacent. If she turns out to be a treacherous person, our laxity contributed to our victimization.

Sometimes people are exactly as they appear. Other times

Humans, movement, scent, and sound are all used in the animal kingdom as means of deception, to draw prey in or to frighten predators away. Humans are no different. A man may promise a great many things and never come through. A woman may proclaim lifelong love and affection while sleeping around. Even if this man or woman disappears from your life, never to return, you will not be without their presence. The wounds caused from misplaced trust are often the hardest to heal.

1365050718.0,1bn4ng,The Tao of Chess (and Other Stuff),theBrahman,17,0,42,"I've been thinking a lot about the game of chess and how it intertwines with Taoist philosophy. Now some people may say that it actually goes against Taoist saying that chess all about fighting and controlling the board

The first thing you need to do to be able to see my view is look at the opposing sides of pieces (black &amp; white) as yin and yang. Now, most likely a black piece will find it's way there and a battle would ensue. 

This leads into my next idea, when I say strategic, I'm saying strategy in a way following a certain harmony with the goal of overcoming the other. I believe that yin and yang are constantly in conflict with each other, rather than gently gliding by each other in easy harmony, but still I see these as the same, in a way. Like if you were looking at a volcano eruption from a spaceship far away, the volcano lava would look perfectly harmonious with the shape of the earth, volcanoes destroy trees and eat up land. So fighting and harmony are the same. And wherever there is yin present there is the yang principle also, the yang principle will try to balance

This is why I don't try cultivate non-thinking (although I find meditation good for other reasons), non-thinking is present. Think about the action of kicking a ball, you think ""To kick the ball I first have to get my foot under the ball"". But what's really going on behind the idea ""get under the ball""? A crazy amount factors unfactorable! Un-thinkable thoughts. See what I'm getting at? And if you try to think about those un-thinkable thoughts, like how does one get under the ball? You might come up with answers like ""by moving the foot forward"" or ""by just kicking it"", but how does one move the foot forward? How does one just kick? That could go on to infinity, infinitely rejuvenating the yang principle.

So you see, because fighting is harmony close up.

Also I thought this was interesting:

pond-moves 1 space vertical (barely any action)

knight-L shaped movement (more action than the pond) 

bishop-full diagonal movement (more than knight or pond)

rook-full horizontal movement (same as bishop)

Queen-full horizontal and diagonal (greater than knight and bishop)

King-moves 1 space in any direction (barely any action)

I had a hefty fight with my gf last night and I've found guidance and peace here before.

So here goes I suppose:
The fight centered around ethics. She finds me sanctimonious and condescending at times, but that's completely a matter of perspective. I'm used to being surrounded with people who appreciate my absolute honesty. If I say something to offend them, they will tell me immediately. She's not like that, and I'm finding it difficult to adjust.

I want her to be happy with her decisions and not care if I disagree with them. Not that I want her to ignore my thoughts on the matter, I realize that I'm not sure what she wants, which explains why I feel a bit lost.

I recognize a great opportunity here: I will become more able to tell someone how I feel about something in a way that does not make them feel chastised or belittled. But I'm finding the road difficult.

This makes sense as we see folks having to eliminate gluten. The extra acid and yeast being the precursors to some cancers.

1373660818.0,1i6dl0,A Synthesis of Taoism and Virtue Theory.,Danistan619,16,0,10,"Hello r/taoism

I was wondering if anyone had any thought about a synthesis of Virtue Theory and Taoism.

So just a little background information on Virtue Theories. Virtue Theories are much more focused on the character of the moral agent than with the particular action (Deontology) or with its outcomes (Utilitarian). The primary question in response to a situation is something like ""How can I use this situation to be kind, [list of virtues]?"". Some examples of Virtue Theories are Aristotelian Ethics developed by Aristotle (~350 BCE) and Confucianism developed by Confucius (~500 BCE). Exactly which virtues or character traits ought to be sought after depends on which theory is being used. The Ancient Greeks and Chinese, for example, would praise different virtues. And the virtues can also be different for different types of people within one ethical framework. For instance Confucianism tends to focus on questions like ""What would a virtuous mother/father/child do in this situation?"" as opposed to ""What would a virtuous person do in this situation?"". For this reason Confucianism is sometimes called a Role Ethic instead of a Virtue Ethic.

Now I am mostly just looking for a compare and contrast of general virtue theories and Taoism. I have long been an appreciator of Taoism and last year I had a course on Ethics which discussed Deontology

So if looked at naively this seems like a separation within myself into an appreciator of virtue theories and an appreciator of Taoism. So against this idea I would like to seek out a synthesis (as much as possible) of a general virtue theory framework and Taoism. Most of this synthesis will happen within myself but I think that hearing your ideas would be helpful.

Thanks for your time.

1346448083.0,z5mfx,Got a bunch of Taoist literature from a Taiwanese restaurant,sup3,16,0,7,"Hello /r/taoism

I thought I'd tell you a story you might find interesting.  I've been visiting this larger city recently in the USA and have been going to this Chinese/Taiwanese restaurant.  Last time I was there the owner who is this Taiwanese lady started talking to me about Taoism.  She's like 40 or 50-ish and said her whole life she was never religious until about five years ago.  She said her husband was diagnosed with cancer and had only a couple days / weeks to live but he stopped eating meat and starting studying taoism and ended up living another two years after that.  According to her meat is harder to digest and is not only bad for your body but is bad for your karma (I'm not a vegetarian

Anyway she gave me a bunch of literature about Taoism.  Most of it is bilingual Chinese / English and it looks like they were all published by the [Happy Buddha Temple](http://www.happybuddhatemple.org/).   They have a library where you can read most of these.

* *Shower of Wisdom: A Collection of Teacher Ji-Gong's Works (濟公老師慈語綠)*
* *The Great Learning (大學)*
* *The Revelation of General Douglas MacArthur*
* *The Testimony of Tao Through Parables and Scriptures in the Bible*
* *Introduction to Dao (先天大道 簡介)* (completely in Chinese)
* *The Revelation of Jesus Christ*

A couple things stood out.

1) She pronounces it ""Daoism"" with a hard ""D"".

2) She said we're all caught in a cycle of rebirth and build up karma over a long time but once you start studying Daoism I'm pretty sure she said your past karma stops being important.

3) She said the ""Dao"" (道 = road) is the path ""back to God"".

4) She talked about a state of mind that's positive and not governed by negative emotions like greed.

5) She talked a lot about Buddhism and Confucianism and some of the literature she gave me also does this.  I think it was all kind of the same to her.  Like the Buddha

I've been wanting to learn about Taoism for a while now so I'm looking forward to reading some of this.  She also talked about this Taoist master who goes city to city giving seminar and stuff,False,,t5_2qhmd,False,,,t3_z5mfx

Of the darkness and abyss

A smile is plastered upon a boy.

Only knowing aloneness

Never knowing company

His smile radiates across universes 

And has no opposite.

Impossible to perceive

Sound waves ebb and flow.

Flowers stretch until they break in two

And snails retreat into their shells.

The sun rises

Anyway, Howard Crick has his boring life turn around once he stops taking life so seriously, like a Taoist. However, once his english professor/shrink reads the author's draft, he tells Howard that he needs to die. He tells Howard that there is no death that could be more beautiful, or (it is implied) quick than the one written for him. Howard is obviously very upset and has a breakdown. So my question is this: Would you fight it? After having a new life

Here is my second question: How do Taoists feel when it comes to violence? Do they only go to war in a draft? Would they dodge a draft if they feel the war is for an unjust cause?

Physicalism, all our emotions and brain patterns are neural patterns, and so on. This is the strictly scientific view.

Dualism is the idea that there is something ""else"" that exists ""outside"" the material. The particulars vary from there - reincarnation

It would seem that these ideas are mutually exclusive - it must be one or the other

But one of Taoism's great themes is the unity of all things. It's not alone among the eastern philosophies for a sort of monist worldview, which is of course the most difficult to get across to most people, but hopefully won't be an issue here. Feel free, by the way, to disagree and posit a better wording or perspective.)

The key is that taoists wouldn't recognize a difference between the spiritual and the material. These are two labels slapped on different ""parts"" of the Tao. Since existence, what's important isn't distinguishing between materials and non-materials, but recognizing all things as part of your experience, and therefore part of everything. Any other way is as pointless as identifying an ""absolute east"".

Of course, but never with perfect accuracy, and always with a strong bias towards what worked for him.

People who consider themselves smart do often worry themselves with things such as science and religion. However, but oftentimes there will be discrepancies—sometimes without compromise.  The “real” reality is beyond our grasp, and we are limited in experience, knowledge and understanding by the human form we take.  Collectively, we can aim to pool our minds, thereby gaining more perspectives and perhaps a slightly less dim image of ourselves and the rest of existence, but still we fall short—even with the internet.) Although some religions and some science can be very convincing, there is no belief system that stands up to scrutiny without at some point attributing some part to faith. (Science is included

1350193672.0,11g7zi,What do you guys think of this?,a-boy-named-Sue,17,6,12,"**Dialectics 101**

**Introduction**

Dialectics is the study of change. It is a way of thinking that tries to explain how change works, which we will explore later in this article. But first, let's find out more about what dialectics is.

**The Study of Change**

Why study change? The answer is simple. Dialectics believes that change is all there is. Everything is change. A popular statement reflecting this viewpoint is ""change is the only constant."" Most people believe this to be true and insightful when they hear it, fixed, permanent, and eternal. But this opposing viewpoint doesn't contradict dialectics, as we will discover. Instead, it affirms dialectics by being the antithesis of the dialectical viewpoint itself. But before that can make any sense, we have to find out about an important concept known as the unity of opposites.

**The Unity of Opposites**

The Unity of Opposites is the idea that things that seem to be opposed are actually united in a deeper sense. The best way to understand this idea is to use real-world examples. The early Greek philosopher Heraclitus, but they are both necessary parts of the whole. Without either of them, there is no bow. The existence of the bow itself depends on the opposition of the bow string and the wooden backbone. When these two aspects of the bow are drawn in opposite directions, the bow becomes capable of its function. Male and female to reproduce, in and out go the tides to churn the ocean, the piston does up and down and the wheels turn round.  This is the unity of opposites.


**Monism**

Monism is the idea that everything in the world is made from a single undivided ""substance."" It doesn't matter what the substance is, but it's really very important, because much of Western culture is based on the idea that there are two basic substances in the world, usually called ""mind"" and ""body"" or ""spirit"" and ""matter."" This view is called dualism, and it is the basis of most of the things modern Westerners believe.

But monism, even though it might seem that way. Everything comes from and is always a part of a single undivided reality, which could be called Tao, Void, God, Nothingness, or any number of things. Some of these names for the ""one substance"" may seem to contradict each other, or the same ""nothing."" But that is a very complicated matter

**Dialectical Monism**

Dialectical Monism is the basic metaphysical position of dialectics itself. Metaphysics is the part of philosophy that is concerned with questions like ""is there really only one kind of thing in the world, as we discovered in the previous section on Monism, there is really only one ""substance"" which the whole world is made from, but that substance always takes the form of complementary opposites.

This can be a very confusing idea for some people, it's necessary to understand the nature of consciousness.

The sub-sections are going to get a bit longer now

**The Nature of Consciousness**

Consciousness is the self-aware state of the human brain. The brain is a small part of the world which has become so complex in its structure that it has achieved the ability to be aware of itself and the rest of the world. The result of this ability is the set of thinking processes known as the mind.

Ideas such as dialectics are concepts. In order to create concepts, the mind creates things in the conceptual sense by making distinctions within the undivided whole.

However, and the ocean ""is"" the waves in a very real sense. But for a sailor in a small boat, it can be very useful to distinguish one wave from another. The human brain and mind are survival tools. They allow us to make distinctions and have thoughts, because some ""waves"" on the ocean (aspects of the whole) are very bad for our health and we need to be able to deal with them, or we die.

The dualistic nature of thought can be easily demonstrated by considering how we can think about any ""thing"" we can think about. For example, anytime we think, we establish dualism in our own minds. So, while monism is true of the world, dualism is true of the mind. That is what is meant by ""dialectical monism."" This is also why Zen masters and other mystics stress getting rid of thought to perceive the world directly, but that's another issue.

For now, let's focus on how they are opposed as the human mind sees it.

**Thesis

Thesis, because the people who helped create most of the important concepts in dialectics didn't use them. But they are useful in spite of this, and they make the concepts involved easier to understand.

A thesis is any thing, and an antithesis is the opposite of that thesis. It's important to note that the antithesis doesn't always have to be the ""exact opposite"" in the way we usually think of opposites. For example, in the case of the lamp we discussed in the previous article, the antithesis of ""the lamp"" was given as ""everything that is not the lamp."" In other words, thesis and antithesis are context-dependent. It isn't important that we find the ""exact opposite"" in the usual sense, but instead, we should find the opposite that is meaningful within the given context.

Now we are getting to the interesting part. In the Introduction section

**Principles of Change**

Change is the result of a thesis interacting with its antithesis. For example, resulting in change - the ice melts and the pan fills with water. This process is known as synthesis.

But it doesn't stop there. Each time a synthesis is created, which serve as the antithesis of the new thesis. Wherever there is a thesis (any thing, idea, or distinction of any kind), there will be an antithesis, and therefore the process of change is never-ending. New syntheses are continuously created and transformed as they become theses themselves.

There is nothing in the world that is immune to change and transformation. This is actually very simple to understand if we have followed the previous sections. The only thing that is constant is the single undivided reality of being, therefore it cannot be envisioned, conceptualized, or thought about. It can only be experienced directly.

The direct experience of undivided reality is available to us at all times, making distinctions, and creating conceptual ""things."" That's why dialectics is the study of things and how they change. It is not just a way of thinking about the world, it is a way of thinking about how people think.

**Progress**

Progress is a description of how change looks from a human perspective over long periods of time. As new syntheses are constantly created

This may sound very ""academic, much of the drudgery, hard physical labor, and pain of life has been eliminated through modern labor-saving devices, medicines, and improvements across the whole spectrum. Many painful and even fatal diseases which once killed millions have been entirely wiped out. Slavery is no longer practiced in developed nations. Science has uncovered increasingly useful truths about the natural world which have led to countless advancements.

Despite all this, many people no longer buy the idea that human society is ""going anywhere."" While war and conflict are undeniably tragic, this view ignores the reality that many of the most important advancements in history have resulted from them. Heraclitus said that ""war is king of all and father of all."" While this statement may be understandably uncomfortable to modern audiences, even that discomfort is evidence of progress - we are gradually becoming increasingly humane in our outlook and less willing to tolerate the outrages and abuses of war. War makes us uncomfortable, whereas a thousand years ago, our lives might have centered around its glory.

Progress is a constant process, setbacks and reversals are what ultimately drive progress forward, because a synthesis cannot be obtained unless an antithesis interacts with any given thesis. To use an anaolgy, unless the away team wins some of the games, the home team doesn't learn much, and may not go on to win the state championship next year as a result.

Even though nobody can tell you whether a single coin flip will come up heads or tells with any accuracy, over very long time scales, progress has a predictable course. If we understand that nature of things and how change works, we can look at the whole course of human history and use it to figure out what will happen in the future with a high level of confidence.

If this sounds difficult to believe, and most of them have to do with the best interests of those who have the most money and power in Western society. It isn't in their interest for ordinary people to understand dialectics, history, or the future. This isn't an organized ""conspiracy theory,"" it's just human nature. The ""powers that be"" are benefiting from things just the way they are, so why should they want people to understand the nature of change? Naturally, they aren't going to go out of their way to teach anyone that sort of thing

The first paragraph in this chapter, I could not tell it's existence through visual methods alone. It would be indistinguishable from the paper.

1373546859.0,1i2rmx,A Taoist interpretation of the Problem of Evil.,chewingofthecud,13,5,35,"This is a x-post from r/DebateReligion which you can find [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/1hxjlh/a_proposed_solution_to_the_problem_of_evil/).

I'm not getting much love on the r/DebateReligion subreddit, though from a non-Christian perspective, more as a thought experiment than anything else.  Any thoughts?

Here is my post:

I am certain someone else has proposed a similar solution

You can't have up without down. You can't have positive without negative. You can't have good without evil.

That's it. But

God as conceived by most religions is a non-dual being. Independent of time, the ultimate being is just that: Ultimate. It encompasses everything, all possibilities and potentialities. I do not know whether such a being exists, and venture no guess. However, assuming that there is such a being, and assuming further that it does contain within it all possibilities, would it not be absurd, to question the possibility of evil existing?

Not only that, good and evil are relative to one another, they each determine the boundary in to which the other cannot intrude. Sure some things can be neutral or neither good nor evil, but the very possibility of good is necessarily dependent on the possibility of evil. Here is a concrete example of how this is the case:

If I were to show you a blank sheet of white paper, by virtue of the fact that there is a thing that is the circle (composed of ink) and a thing that is not the circle (the blank part of the page). Then if I take the black ink and dump it all over the page, you will no longer have a circle, since there is no distinction between circle and non-circle. You cannot have one without the other.

Now, God is also responsible for the creation of a being known as Satan, which as far as I can tell, is infinitely treacherous and full of hatred... hatred toward God, humanity, creation, everything. How could it be that an infinitely loving God is capable of producing an being of infinite hatred?

How could it be any other way?

Apart from the fact that an ultimate being is capable of anything, because without it, there would be no good.",,False,,t5_2qhmd,,http://www.reddit.com/r/taoism/comments/1i2rmx/a_taoist_interpretation_of_the_problem_of_evil/

I'm a PhD student from Melbourne

The basic theory is derived from Iain McGilchrist (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFs9WO2B8uI) who suggests that the left hemisphere of the brain sees the world in a fragmented, a process philosopher who has suggested that the dominant metaphysics of Western civilisation (i.e., the inherent understanding of the nature of existence and the way that life 'is') is mechanistic materialism. He explains it similarly to McGilchrist and also suggests that this mindset sees people not as complex, unique individuals, but as means to an end. Similarly, the environment is not seen as complex ecosystems that all things require for life, but as exploitable resources for human gain. 

I was drifting around reddit and came across this:

""""All things are at one with Infinity.
When humanity is centered in this oneness:
the sky remains clear and beautiful, the valley is the source of abundance, all creatures reproduce, regenerate and replenish the earth, leaders and kings are in harmony and nations are at peace.
When humanity focuses on the manifestations of Infinity
the sky becomes cloudy with pollution, the valley no longer produces abundance and what it does produce is tainted. Leaders and kings take their nations to war in order to control the untainted lands, creatures no longer reproduce, species die out and parts of the earth, unattended by the myriad creatures, no longer regenerate or replenish themselves, the people of all nations live in conflict, hunger and depression.""
What is your favourite interpretation of the Tao? What is the single greatest message you get from it? The text still resonates with me after all this time, every day it seems we get further away. Do you file the Tao under ""new age""?
Oneness with infinity

I thought there was a bit of an overlap between the theory guiding my research and Taoist philosophy

A major aspect of my thesis is looking at consumer materialism and how it arises as a result of reifying the abstract connotations associated with objects (from an idea called the Fallacy of Misplaced Concreteness)

I used to be very anxious, but never came to know what Confucius, Lao Tze and others have said.

Just recently my classes came back from a long period of strike, my classmates, the ambient and myself. I came to be wrong. All was going very naturally, except by the fact that in the first days there were a lot of girls turning me on, and my feelings were in a storm.

I don't know what happened today. Maybe is something that I read in here or in a book, when something happens I always think ""well, I can work around with that"", or when something is about to happen I automatically think ""well, if it goes that way, then it will be so"". Not sadly calm... Something more like ""deadly"" calm, like a calm tactician, and has true passion accomplishing things through the way of the peace and the calm.

As I have told before, but that's not how it works, actually. When I faced the so-tempting girls, the neediness and the emotional storm that previously stroke me so hard could be seen from a distance. I knew they were there, but I myself was in peace. I knew I wanted that, but I also knew I didn't desperately need that, so instead of being ""ohmygod that ass"", ""ohmygod so cute""

The final point is the objectivity. I can think much clearer now, but lots of ""inner preparation"". I went like I already knew how to do it in the most efficient way, with no argues with myself, just ""accepting"" what my mind was ordering. It was like I had done it a lot of times before, but by the way I don't recall adopting such methods before.

It's more like that that peace brings almost instantly to me conclusions that before used to take a long time thinking.

The martial arts and taoism teachings are intertwined and pretty much go hand in hand. Occasionally I'll see him in my dreams and we'll talk (he's still alive).

In the dream, but because I was psychologically imbalanced and had proven that I was unfit to teach martial arts. Although I'm doing something else at the moment, it's always been my dream to teach martial arts full time. I felt very sad when I woke up.

It's probably true - although I was a good student, hard to unwind. I'll tell the story if there's any interest. Then earlier this year I went joined a muay thai gym and got a little out of hand during sparring, ended up axe-kicking the muay thai teacher in the face and then boasting about it on facebook. A very immature thing to do, and I feel too ashamed to go back to the gym despite paying $150 a month for it. It also seems to me evidence that I am not ready to lead any sort of personal development class, which is what martial arts is to me, much more than just exercise.

What do you think? Should I talk to my teacher in person? Just accept it? Maybe I misinterpreted things... dreams are odd

Nonyielding - 非收益 - Fēi shōuyì

Follow the rules
of the combat arena.
Inside the cage
never yield to aggressors.
When outside
affirm compassion.

~inspired by Deng Ming-Dao

The world and society as a whole are competitive. The sages use the warrior metaphor to show how to meet this competition. Never yield to the aggression of an opponent. Sidestep

Whether you are a lawyer, doctor, businessman, athlete, or any other profession, you will invariably come into competition with others in the field (or natural forces which present obstacles in your way). There is a right and a wrong way to compete. Avoid anger and greed. Use concentration and awareness.

It is not mere coincidence that concentration and awareness are also a necessity for spiritual cultivation. This is why followers of Tao incorporate the way of the warrior into spiritual training. The warrior and the sage both seek transcendence of emotion and pettiness as a path to self-perfection - a life lived in pursuit of the deepest truth.

Outside the arena, and reflex but use a different form of expression. Compassion can be exercised in place of force. That is why the combination of these two ways, of the warrior and Tao, can coexist so perfectly. The versatility provided to the complete being cannot be replicated by the brash and boastful swordsman. The complete being commands the extremes of the universe while maintaining the balance within.

In short

In other words, you're actually just seeing more of what is in front of you and has always been.

Then, I don't know, for lack of a better word ... ""right action."" It would appear as if you (your ego/personality) made it happen, but in actually it was just your attention to reality. There is nothing magical or ""you are in ultimate control"" about it.

And, in your mind, outside of your Way. And without the full understanding of ""mutual arising"" and how everything evokes its opposite, you end up with as much ""don't want"" as ""want."" Which is where, I think, the ""manifestation"" idea does a disservice to those it preaches to by not honoring this, and where it deviates harshly from Taoism.

I guess my point in posting this/opening up a discussion about it is that it illustrates

There is a river flowing over a seemingly random landscape.

Wu wei is not the shifting waves, or any other emotional guidance. 

Wu wei is not the force that shaped the landscape for wu wei is order and the landscape's artist is chaos.

Wu wei is the gravity within the metaphor, but also essential to its function. It pulls the water, and yourself in it, toward lower ground and you begin to travel over the landscape. From your perspective there is always motion, often turbulent and sometimes confusing yet there are always visual cues to the events of the immediate future, you just need to keep your eyes open.

The gravity which is essential to the form and enabling of the function of the metaphor is paralleled in reality as the passing of time. With time frozen the universe is completely still and stable. Unfrozen there is motion

From a human perspective, progress is not linear, although it may appear to be when viewed over eons and from great distance. The path of progress is not circular either as was supposed in the past with less knowledge and narrower perspective.

1371337705.0,1gfacn,An anecdote from today,Salamosam,8,2,7,"In order to attend a week-long conference on meditation, in case anyone's interested

Yesterday I was asked to move some chairs around in the main hallway to create some nice sitting spaces, contemplate, and engage with other people in conversation. I went all out. Me and another volunteer spent 45 moving these chairs around. They are the modular, industrial type chairs you might see in a university lounge: low, comfortable together or separately, easy to move and place in an oddly-shaped environment. We arranged and rearranged the chairs, and created four different spaces of different sizes and imagined that everyone could be comfortable in one

The very first chair I moved, you would face the ceiling. You could still sort of sit on it regularly, especially if you were a toddler or kid. All the chairs had a five sided shape, so it sort of made an interesting thing to look at if you were sitting in the other chairs nearby. My intention, if I had one, was to create a conversation starter. Why was this chair upside down? I imagined that people who didn't know each other would look at it and make a joke, and then possibly start a conversation that wouldn't have started otherwise. I thought a focal point like an upside down chair would create a sense of play in an otherwise unplayful environment.

In fact before I left last night that is exactly what happened. Two guys from facilities management raised a few eyebrows at the chair, and laughed at their jokes. Very quickly I felt like I was in a space of great potential. 

I talked with my roommate about the chairs and how it was an interesting creative project. I said it was interesting how one volunteer didn't get into it and was slow to move things around or offer suggestions

When I came in today the chair was right side up. Other chairs nearby were spread out again and the sense of enclosed conversation space was gone. I vowed, and not be blocked by the formation of chairs. A fine motive, but not one that explained returning the challenging chair to it's mundane orientation.

I returned the chairs as best I could to the way they were set up yesterday, but stuck to my guns. I believed the upside down chair did not block the flow, and that the authority figure returned it to it's normal position only because it made her uncomfortable, because it challenged her complacency.

Now I know the authority figure from another context, and continues to, to make this conference a success, to create new wisdom and spread it as far as she can, and to make the world a better place the best way she knows how. I agreed to talk with her about the upside down chair, to try to address her issues and also to offer my perspective. She had a few minutes to look at the chairs with me, and she agreed that the traffic flow was improved and no longer an issue, but I was unable to convince her

We spent a few amiable minutes together moving a few other chairs around

Returning to the other volunteers and my other tasks I felt deflated, one of whom thought the space I created was ""fun"", and another who encouraged me to return the space to they way I wanted it, knowing that I got such a kick out of it, did not talk to me about the chairs. The matter was dropped like it never existed. My precious positive energy started to drain away quickly.

1371148783.0,1ga993,A brief essay on wu-wei.,chewingofthecud,6,3,3,"Wu-wei is one of those things that I've always known about intuitively

1)  **Wu-wei and creativity:**  As a musician, but I *can* tell you how to destroy creativity: over-think it.  I played guitar for about a decade before I wrote my first song that I was happy with, and in that time I tried to master the technique of playing, to become a ""skilled"" guitarist.  But I took this too far.  Instead of this technique helping me say what I wanted to say, I would always over-analyze and think too hard about the theory behind any idea I came up with, which would stop my momentum.  It wasn't until I stopped trying, and paid attention to that little voice inside (my ""muse"" for lack of a better word), I often wake up in the morning and have a tune stuck in my head.  In this semi-conscious state I always think it is a song that I heard on the radio or elsewhere

2)  **Wu-wei and civil disobedience:**  When you look at social movements, when they refuse to participate, no amount of force in the world can make them do so, if their conviction is firm.  To change things through political action requires a lot of effort, often people must devote a whole lifetime to climbing the ranks and gaining influence - yet achieving things through political *inaction* can sometimes be the catalyst to turning things around instantly.  I'll give some examples... there are many.  The most obvious one is Rosa Parks; her refusal to move to the back of the bus during the era of civil rights strife in America was a turning point.  Why?  Because she said ""no"", because she'd had enough and no one could budge her.  Another, more modern example:  Mohamed Bouazizi was a street vendor from Tunisia who suffered humiliation and antagonism from corrupt local officials, he killed himself by immolation.  While this sounds like an action

3)  **Wu-wei and governance:**  Politics is a touchy issue.  I will not attempt to proselytize anyone in to adopting my own beliefs about government.  However the Tao Te Ching is undeniably political, I will simply suggest some reading with this in mind.  Look at chapters 17, 58, 59 and especially 57 and 75.

Icons

What is meditation? There are many types of meditation; we will speak about non-conceptual meditation. Non-conceptual meditation (zuowang or zuochan) is roughly defined as a practice that uses the qi to find the Qi – or uses the mind to find the Mind – uses the de (shen) to find Dao. The method/process is generally directed “inward” (neidan

How does compulsion arise and maintain itself? The view/assumption is that wisdom (reality) is found through a direct experience of our true nature; that apparently can be temporarily obscured by excessive and compulsive directing the qi/mind “outward” to create a false, indefinable, unconditioned. 

When the practice of meditation is associated with or offered in the context of religion it comes with a set of symbols and icons – a set of teachings. These teachings, inevitably take on the characteristics of history (time) and culture (socio-political norms) – and often “redefine” or transform conventional culture (customary use of symbols). These symbols eventually form a single “orthodoxy” – a standard set of symbols.

What is an icon – symbol? As infants (before speech) our perceptions are direct and perhaps quite plain. Firm definitions do not define our experience . 
We “learn” symbols as we learn language and much of this process is accompanied by praise and blame, me and a world). Ultimately whether we identify as an “insider” with conventional behaviors/symbols or an “outcast” with rebellious with idiomatic, anarchistic behavior/symbols, our “position” or point of view is always relative to a set of symbols (customs, language and relationships). In fact, we can imagine the symbols use us when they become a compulsive struggle for finding “meaning” and “value” outside our experience (salvation, committed “love”, etc.) .
The contemplative sense of awakening undermines the solid validity of symbols the practitioner may have established. Likewise meditation exposes the transparency of symbols while the eroding the notion of an abiding self. To avoid the extremes of nihilism (pre-occupation with emptiness or meaninglessness) and transcendence (excitement – spiritual materialism) we continue to relate to symbols but in what way? Symbols remain of interest as a means of expression rather than as a means of solid definition of experience. 

We use icon/symbols to define our own experience AND express it in our interactive relationships. The practice of meditation offers a personal experience that does not require effort per se. With the view that it is a “return” to our unchanging true nature there is a suggestion that we will be “liberating” our experience from the compulsive use of symbols. The experience of meditation itself defies definition (apophetic). But to abandon symbols/language/icons altogether is not possible – our relative condition is, by so doing, complete our experience of wisdom – awakening. For this reason ancestral lineages of practitioners have left us a wealth of symbols and icons. If we view them as artwork we have a choice to become curators or artists. In the matter of Asian traditions being transmitted to the so-called West, there is problem of suitability and a chance to refresh the transmission. Those busy creating and sustaining spiritual materialism are not true artists. If we are burdened by exclusively curatorial motives or oppressive curatorial leaders the beauty is loss in the invitation to seeking wisdom and the tide of materialism goes on defining and redefining hope and fear – nothing else. 

There is a sense of maturation that arises in meditation practice that seeks completion in some sort of expression . When this occurs the icons/symbols of the transmission become our own – they are revealed
This circle of revelation or expression is of supreme importance. As the practice finds a new home in the qi, indeed responsibility, to renew the language/symbols/icons of the tradition. 
Without fully maturing the practice of meditation we risk losing the momentum of our lineage ancestors and remaining incomplete. This incomplete quality leaves us with feelings of compromise, self-hate. When the complete teaching and its fruition are not alive the practice of meditation will become nothing but an emotional sedative.

enlighten the people

The people are hard to govern because they know too much./
And so to rule a state with knowledge is to be a detriment to the state./
Not to rule a state through knowledge is to be a blessing to the state.""

So I'm rather conflicted at the moment. I've been hanging out with and sleeping with this girl, if you will, of the conflict I'm experiencing stems because I don't trust her. There are multiple reasons: she has a boyfriend who doesn't know about us, she's extremely closed and guarded, and she's quite intelligent and clearly knows how to manipulate people. As a side note, I'm not saying this because she's a woman; men can be just as manipulative.

Anywho, that happens when I really want to be having sex and we're doing something else or she's not in the mood, but sometimes we're just hanging out and I don't feel comfortable around her.

This leads me to have an internal struggle with myself with one voice saying I should just tell her I can't see her anymore

And that is why I'm posting this story here. I can see both sides being in the Tao. I don't know if I'm letting fear of losing what might be keeping me from letting her go and granting myself peace of mind. I also don't know if that course of action is putting too much weight to the future.

I have a feeling that it's pride and lust keeping me from ending things

TL;DR I don't know whether to tell someone that I can't have them in my life

I'm going through a really tough period in my life at the minute. I have a 6 year relationship going very steadily wrong and the people closest to me say I am changing from the happy, stressed and angry.

I don't however feel like I have changed at all so this is very scary to me. Although I didn't really know myself before I now feel like I don't know anything about me and I am becoming everything I don't want to be without even realising.

I have recently started Tai Chi (1 lesson) and while I was doing it I truly felt a difference in how I felt about myself and my happiest in a long long time. 

As a result of this tai chi experience I'm wondering if I should have a small look at taoism to see if this can help me improve my life and how I feel and maybe combat this change I am going through and not hurt those around me. 

is there any recommended reading I could do?

&gt;Ithkuil, where, instead of discrete independence between related entities, such concepts are seen as complementary aspects of a single holistic entity. Such complementarity is in turn reflected in the derivation of word-roots. By “complementarity” is meant that the manifestation of a concept appears in any given context as either one sort of entity or another, but never both simultaneously; yet, neither manifestation can be considered to be a discrete whole without the existence of the other. A simple illustration of complementarity is the flip of a coin: the coin can only land on one side or the other, yet without both sides being part of the coin,,False,t3_oh9fe

Sat Dec 24 – 11/30 – If you dared to look inward yesterday (and did a bit of house cleaning in your gnarly subconscious) a fresh start could be wonderful. If you are clinging to old patterns they may fall on you like a ton-o-bricks. Emergency medical centers will be busy and your blind habits may

Sun Dec 25 – 12/1 – First day of the Metal Ox Moon. Yeah

Mon Dec 26 – 12/2 – If you are keeping the precepts of jie qi – following the mandates of the Chinese calendar

Tue Dec 27 – 12/3 – Today is much like yesterday. Still tired from overdoing it? Consult the Oracle. Travel and talking too much will drain you dry. Let someone help. Get a very modest medical treatment but not a colonic. Fire Dragon day indicator could provide dangerous lurches (thinking you have enough energy to be vigorous and daring) – actions w/out thought. Don’t take any dares. There is risk of suddenly exhausting the new-year yang that has barely sprouted. 

Wed Dec 28 – 12/4 – Those in “tune” with jie qi will have another very nice day. Long-range plans will deliver some long awaited fruition. The day has an unusually smooth qi. The elements and animals (Stem/Branches) line up very well. Consult the ancestors for visions of the Lunar New Year. Learn from Jim Kelly’s fate in Enter the Dragon when he over-stated: “I will be too busy looking good, but don’t over-estimate your cool!

Thu Dec 29 – 12/5 – Goodness and gentleness pay off. The day is full of new starts that are solid and have been well-planned. It’s easy to find your place in the pack/team/posse – it’s good to work w others. Starting a journey or going back to school goes well especially when you head southeast (go w modesty and freshness).

Fri Dec 30 – 12/6 – Misconduct will put you in the crosshairs of the assassin. You will be visited by ominous apparently unjust retribution. Whatever you do, cemeteries and the Tenderloin. Genetic predispositions for death (dying like your parents did) have the advantage today. According to the Tibetan calendar 9 BAD omens collide today (from 5:30pm to 7pm tomorrow) – the Chinese calendar generally concurs. Building today will bring calamity to the family. Arguments will destroy your reputation. Harmless bad habits turn into raging addictions and chronic diseases. If you can, stay home under the covers and think good thoughts. Eat vegetarian food. Think last chance for the haunting ancestors to harm you.

Sat Dec 31 – 12/7 – Not outa the dark yet – eat veggies. Though nine GOOD omens start this evening – wait for it – the sweet good qi will arrive like a gentle breeze around 7pm. Cuddle up w your number one and spoon quietly into the night. Dreams should be awesome. Think the haunting ones are heading back to hell – you did your best. They will take their auto-accident score and go down. Before you sleep make a sincere pledge to be a better person in 2012. 

Sun Jan 1 – 12/8 – The nine GOOD omens rule until 9pm! Happy New Year! Ya, stop analyzing the “conflict” and change the world by your own positive actions! Taking a dose of tonic herbs might help. 

Mon Jan 2 – 12/9 – Ok calm down. Avoid divination

Tue Jan 3 – 12/10 – Use the day to commit to your New Year’s resolutions. Back-peddle. Go home if you have been traveling. The tsok (offering) for Guru Rinpoche today is directed to Dorje Drolo (his wrathful emanation). It serves as a reminder to use the sharp edge of your belligerence to cut out the very heart of your belligerence.

Watch out I'm philosophical and sharey today!

So, perceived or real, that happened to you; would the world stop turning if you just let it go?

That's not to say that there aren't important matters

Once perspective is achieved then we can begin to take our egos out of the equation. If I die tomorrow does that mean the universe stops working? Does that mean that the world stops turning? Does that mean that someone across town breaks their daily routine? No. Am I important? Ultimately

Once perspective is achieved and ego is removed then we can see the world for what it is. What is the world? It doesn't matter. Again

Good things and bad things happen. How do we appreciate the good times without the bad times? Would they feel as good? What is good and bad

So I was drunk and had been recently practicing some neikung.

I was walking down the street and yelled at a car

I started feeling really agressive

Then I started hitting everything, publicities until I started feeling really dangerous, nothing seemed to hurt me (yes I was drunk but after all that I will tell you, I just have a little scratch on my left arm and two very little bruising on my right hand) and then at one point, I just remembered that all this strength was because of the meditation I had done, accumulating some yin and yang as I had studied and that I was projecting and absorbing energy through my centers…

So I just spontaneously decided, the whole passenger side just blew into pieces, I couldn’t believe what had happened, I just started walking faster, fleeing the « crime » scene, looked at my hand but couldn’t see any bruising, didn’t felt any pain, it looked like a hammer pierced through it many times…

For the first time in my life, I was excited, ego proud, yet at the same time, afraid of what I could do, seeing that I was kinda out of control…

I’ve been meditating ever since and feeling ups and downs regarding this ego proudness and amazment to the manipulation of energy… I guess I should say that I have already healed people through what looks like Reiki (altough I just did it from my own personal non traditional point of view), the passage of energy from me to someone else, as something possible. I guess, right now, through writing it, I somehow realize that I just never thought that I could use it to destroy as well…

Anyhow, to understand, and that, yes, I could accumulate this energy, but that I had to do it with some respect… Good thing it was just a car and not a human, I guess…

EDIT: after a private exchange, the guy who came hidden, exactly from where I was pointing, looked like a guy who was hiding because he wanted to rob me, and that I had intuitively felt him and yelled at him before he attacked me.... I thought it was obvious so I didn't explained more, but that's what made me mad, but at the same time, because I guessed where he was (and his intentions, and a bit like Hulk loosing control,

Chuang Tzu sums up my first issue:

&gt; *As I look at the matter

CT

And it's true

At the same time

&gt; *The sages are impartial*

&gt; *They regard people as straw dogs*

TTC

&gt; *Therefore the sage says:*

&gt; *I take unattached action

&gt; *I prefer quiet

&gt; *I do not interfere

&gt; *I have no desires

TTC

So regards up/downvoting

But then there're some other passages that suggest something different:

&gt; *Act without action*

&gt; *Manage without meddling*

&gt; *Taste without tasting*

&gt; *Great, few*

&gt; *Respond to hatred with virtue*

TTC

&gt; *The one who meddles will fail*

&gt; *The one who grasps will lose*

&gt; *Therefore

&gt; *They do not grasp and thus do not lose*

TTC

There's an emphasis there on action-as-meddling. I read it as, do it. If it comes naturally, let it. But if you're doing it for some further end - trying to highlight agreement or admonish disagreement, trying to advance some cause or thwart another - then don't act.

The second quote I gave from the TTC agrees with that: it's not ""I take *no* action"" but ""I take unattached action"". So upvote/downvote away as you wish

But then...some more possibilities:

&gt; *Sages do not accumulate*

&gt; *The more they assist others

&gt; *The more they give to others

&gt; *The Tao of heaven*

&gt; *Benefits and does not harm*

&gt; *The Tao of sages*

&gt; *Assists and does not contend*

TTC

&gt; *The sages have no constant mind*

&gt; *They take the mind of the people as their mind*

&gt; *Those who are good

&gt; *Those who are not good

&gt; *Thus the virtue of goodness*

TTC

Those passages say to me, you should be good to them).

This is another quote that could relate to downvoting:

&gt; *The highest goodness resembles water*

&gt; *Water greatly benefits myriad things without contention*

&gt; *It stays in places that people dislike*

&gt; *Therefore it is similar to the Tao*

TTC

To me that makes it pretty clear that downvoting is not cool. Even the disliked should be accepted. And downvoting does seem harder to separate from meddling

At this point though I was wondering

And then I found the following passages:

&gt; *Favor and disgrace make one fearful*

&gt; *The greatest misfortune is the self*

&gt; *What does ""favor and disgrace make one fearful"" mean?*

&gt; *Favor is high; disgrace is low*

&gt; *Having it makes one fearful*

&gt; *Losing it makes one fearful*

TTC


&gt; *Do not glorify the achievers*

&gt; *So the people will not squabble*

TTC

Now that kinda suggests the whole reddit system is contrary to Taoist principles. And really
