I know you want to turn ADOM into something that makes you money on the iPhone, which, you know, whatever.  I've read your blog for years, hoping you'd do something with ADOM, but you never did.  After all this time, can we finally agree that not releasing the source code for ADOM was a very

You want to know what would get you my money?  Releasing the source code and heading a big expansion and development project akin to DCSS.  Everybody loves DCSS and it gets worked on, and improved on an almost daily basis.  However, everyone also likes ADOM, but you haven't done a damn thing with it for like NINE YEARS.  Sure it was your game, and you worked on it for years, and we all appreciate you for that.  Problem is that you then squatted on it and did nothing but have ideas and make promises that you never kept.  

I'd love to be playing ADOM 7.0.0 right now instead of Crawl.  ADOM started as a better game than Crawl to begin with, and even though DCSS has been happening for 6 years now, there's no reason to think that it won't keep improving for another 6.  That could have been your game.  It could be your game that hundreds of people play online every day.

It could also have been your ""Donate Here"" button on the main website.

If you want my money, because I don't have or want an iPhone.  I'm not sure I'd buy ADOM on the android either, because I don't really want to spend hundreds of hours gaming on my DAMN PHONE.

I've played ADOM plenty over the years

The **[Scroll-o-Sprites](http://imgur.com/a/uHx4k)** is a **free asset library** geared toward Roguelike developers.


The scroll contains various cartoony characters, building props, items, symbols and a complete font. All sprites are designed in the traditional monochrome style, used in many classic Roguelikes. This allows for efficient customisation! This is the first edition, so suggestions are very welcome!


Technical information:

* All sprites fit in a 16 x 16px space!

So I'm going to try and contribute to the community instead

Today I'm going talk about one technical aspect of my game [TinyKeep](http://tinykeep.com)

The interactive demo can be found here:
[Dungeon Generation Demo](http://tinykeep.com/dungen/)

Here's how I do it

1 . First I set the number of cells I want to generate

2 . For each ""cell"" I spawn a Rectangle of random width and length within some radius. Again the radius doesn't matter too much

Instead of using uniformly distributed random numbers (the default Math.random generator in most languages)

In addition to this I ensure that the ratio between the width and length of each cell is not too large

3 . At this point we have 150 random cells in a small area

4 . We fill in any gaps with 1x1 sized cells. The result is that we end up with a square grid of differently sized cells

5 . Here is where the fun begins. We determine which of the cells in the grid are rooms - any cell with a width and height above a certain threshold is made into a room. Because of the Park-Miller Normal Distribution described earlier

6 . For the next stage we want to link each room together. To begin we construct a graph of all of the rooms' center points using [Delaunay Triangulation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation). So now all rooms are connected to each other without intersecting lines.

7 . Because we don't want every single room to be linked to every other with a corridor (that would make for a very confusing layout)

8 . The minimal spanning tree looks nice, each guaranteed to be reachable and containing some loops for variety.

9 . To convert the graph to corridors, perfect for a dungeon.

And here's an example of the finished result!

It took me ages to rebuild the engine. To the point where I was thinking

But I succeeded in rebuilding massive chunks of the engine from scratch. And after sharing it on yayhooray.com

Today I recieved two glowing reviews from [indiegames.com](http://indiegames.com/2011/10/demo_red_rogue_aaron_steed.html) and [rock paper shotgun](http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/10/28/crimson-blaggard-red-rogue/) today. For a game I haven't even finished yet.

So if you're working on a roguelike, that you should make something simpler...

Never give up.

Never surrender.

It doesn't matter if I get in for some award (it would be nice though). What matters is that I made that fucking RPG.

People are going to suggest Rogue Legacy, which isn't really much fun and not the type of game I'm looking for. Path of Exile isn't really a roguelike, but it features a stash that can be shared so that you can pass down items to your future characters after you die, which is pretty cool.

I have a script that walks the map placing rooms from a library that the map maker or player can contribute to. Here is what I've done so far:

http://www.brightmoore.net/mcedit-filters-1/dungeonschematicrandomizerv2

I have been bitten by the idea of redstone rooms and dark tunnels spanning a large underground area, skeletons and creepers - solving redstone riddles and chasing after forgotten caches of treasure and equipment in ancient tombs.

I've added some notes on how it works to the blog

The current script features:

1. It won't place rooms above the starting location

2. It suppresses rooms from colliding and overwriting each other

3. It correctly hooks up each room based on the centre of each connected face.


Eventually I want to seed chests around the place

In the sample tile sets are maze sections

For now though

Features:
 
* Delve deep into procedurally-generated dungeons
* Challenging combat means you are always close to death, blocks, counters, and other abilities will ensure your continued survival
* Permanent death: Choose wisely
* Wield one of many swords
* Gamepad-enabled! Play locally with up to four friends
* A brütäl heavy metal soundtrack by Pip Malt

It's taken me about 10 months, and varied combat system that makes for an exciting and unique brawler.

SWOOOORDS! is basically the combat prototype for a much larger action RPG I'm calling Urverden. It will be an attempt at combining the brawler and roguelike genres to provide a unique experience,False,,t5_2rhpi,1347202279.0,,,t3_zl9sh

The format is as follows: difficulty is rated as early game/late game

So without further ado, above and below: Humans, Demigods, and Demonspawn.

**Human:**

* Classes: *Ar

* Difficulty: ## / ##

* The average race, however, comes from their quick levelling.  You can level as quickly as a kobold, but still have good HP.  You can level as quickly as a hill orc, but still be able to branch out into magic.  They are by far the most versatile of the fast-levelling races.

* Fun: ###

* It's the average race.  Hence the average fun score.  I don't think they're horribly boring

**Demigod:**

* Classes: *Cj

* Difficulty: #### / #

* Demigods are difficult to start, not much.  No, demigods are difficult to start because of their aptitudes.  They took a major hit with the aptitude reconfiguring in 0.7: their aptitudes went from 110 to 119 on the old scale.  Combined with their slow levelling, this leads to a somewhat difficult early game.  However, their superb HP, MP and stats will before long make them shine, especially once you start getting enough XP to get past their mediocre aptitudes.  End-game, and moreover because of their superb stats

* Fun: ###

* I do admit that the lack of a god takes one dimension out of the game.  However

**Demonspawn:**

* Classes: *Be

* Difficulty: # to #### / ###

* Demonspawn are not particularly easy.  They do have the advantage over demigods in that they have a few good aptitudes.  They also have worse health, you have an absurdly easy time.  Conversly, if you're stuck with horns 1, colorless scales and one level of negative energy resistance at XL11, you're going to have a fairly difficult time.  It's just variable.  Later on, their demonic mutations are fairly helpful but no longer have the possibility of being game-breaking.  And they lack any other major advantages in the end-game.

* Fun: ####

* I have to admit, just to see what mutation you get.  I do wish they gained mutations just a little more regularly, but whatever.  It's still a fun race to play.

1357881241.0,16d3e6,[Tome] Guide: Higher Archmage - Arcane Specialist,HPLoveshack,43,1,23,"Higher Archmage specializing in Arcane/Aether is one of the most straightforward and powerful casters you can play.  Born into Magic racial talent is direct damage and damage reduction for Arcane Archmages and with Aether Permutation the synergy is incredible.

**Attributes** 

Magic &gt; Constitution &gt; Willpower 

Always max out magic at every level

**Equipment Priority**

* High:  +arcane damage%, +mag, +con, -spell cooldowns

* Medium:  +spellpower, crit multiplier, +physical save

* Low: +arcane resistance, +movespeed, +spellpower on critical, +spell save

Valuable activated abilities to prioritize are Blinding Speed, Phase Door, and any type of Shielding.  Arcane Eye and Stone Wall are nice if you find them at a power of 5 or greater.  Juggernaut and Evasion can sometimes be valuable as well.

Movespeed up to about 30-40% is actually very valuable for allowing you to back away to buy time for cooldowns without taking melee hits.

Arcane resistance becomes extremely valuable once you get Aether Permutation.

Crit multiplier is also extremely valuable as your crit percent approaches 50%+.  The higher your crit percent

**Infusions and Runes**

* wizard/titan/psychic wild infusion (mental and physical)

* wizard/titan/psychic shield rune

* Rune of Reflection

* wizard/titan/psychic healing infusion

Get a wild infusion with mental and physical remove as soon as possible.  The resist % and whether it scales with a good stat are of much lower importance.  If you can't find one, however freezing and stunning are more dangerous generally.

Also

**Escort Rewards**

Healing Light and Chant of Fortitude.  Get these if you get the option.  If you get the option for Premonition

**Strategy while Leveling**

* *1 - 3*

1 Arcane Power

1 Arcane Reconstruction

These will last you through the starting area for Archmages.  Command your staff to Lightning aspect and lvl 3 Lightning should kill most of the enemies in a single cast.  Don't bother sustaining Arcane Power. Aim Lightning to hit multiple enemies at once, DON'T use your manasurge rune.  You will almost certainly die if you do, instead cast your highest mana spells to bottom out your mana ASAP.

Important:  Do not invest anymore class points into anything else other than 1 Flame

* *4 - 7*

Manathrust - keep maxed

1 Teleport

Get 4 points in Illuminate right away, but trust me the huge aoe blind and lighting is absolutely phenomenal and it's only 1 more point to make it deal very good damage early on and still not bad later in the game.   Just be careful not to use it when you have allies/escorts.

* *8 - 15*

1 Glacial Vapour, 1 Shivgoroth Form, 1 Aether Beam, 1 Arcane Vortex, 1 Disruption Shield

1 Probability Travel, Displacement Shield - keep maxed

New Category: Aether

Continue with the same strategy as before, kill with Manathrust.  You'll have a few more tricks now to buy you time for Manathrust to cooldown such as Freeze, Tidal Wave, and Shivgoroth Form's Ice Storm.  All of which are great for managing multiple enemies, especially on multiple sides.  Against difficult enemies and bosses leading with Displacement Shield is a good idea if you don't have an instant cast shielding rune, if you do have the rune, use that then lead with Illuminate and follow with Displacement.  Aether Beam isn't very good yet, also ensure when casting it that you cast it at least 4 tiles away from you or you may silence and damage yourself with it.  Remember it is disarmed if an enemy walks on it

If you have a shielding rune, go ahead and sustain Shielding.

* *16 - 19*

Aether Breach - keep maxed

Born into Magic - keep maxed

This is when your power really starts to focus and ramp up.  Just be careful not to kill yourself with Aether Breach, ensure you are near full hp, have a shield up to absorb the damage, and phase door away from it after the first explosion, you will survive.  Also if all enemies die while Aether Breach is still active, do not autoexplore, you will likely run right into it to loot.  Instead tap your wait 1 turn key a few times until it's done

Remember if you find yourself in a bad position about to die, but not quite below 25%.

* *20 - 29*

New Category: Meta

1 Dispel Magic, 2 Metaflow

1 Aegis

You could try Temporal instead of Meta, debuff removes, and teleportation as well as Aether Breach. If you can find at least 4% more spell cooldown on an item your Manathrust will drop from 3 turn cooldown to 2, which is extremely nice.  There is also an artifact staff that will reduce Manathrust's cooldown by 1 turn.  Manathrust every turn is ridiculous.

Once you get Aegis you can use Aether Avatar more safely as an offensive boost (25% increased damage

Begin sustaining Arcane Shield and consider replacing any weak shielding runes you have with healing runes.  The shield you get from the healing rune will likely be very close in power in addition to the healing.

* *30+*

Prodigy: Aether Permutation

3 Dispel Magic

5 Thick Skin, 1 Arcane Eye, 1 Keen Senses

Once you get Aether Permutation focus on maxing out your arcane resistance and +max arcane resistance.  They will cut the incoming damage your receive by a huge amount.

Spellcraft and Pure Aether will continue to boost your damage output and also are great companions as Pure Aether will make your spells not only more dangerous to the enemy, with Spellcraft maxed and active you don't have to worry about that at all and can even do neat things like drop Aether Breach on your own head to clear out melee range enemies.

**Endgame Notes**

For your final prodigy Corrupted Shell, but I definitely lean toward Corrupted Shell, hard to argue with 150 extra hp and more saves based on con.   By combining Corrupted Shell with Featherwind and Blur Sight (for a measly 42 mana sustain) you can actually get decent defense ratings as a mage too; you end up tough as all hell if you take Corrupted Shell with Aether Permutation.  Meteoric Crash or Bloodspring would be my choices for offensive prodigies.

You will be investing in willpower during the final stretch of levels so your mana will increase very quickly and you will have extra mana to use on sustains.  Keen Senses and Premonition are good choices, not a good position.  Consider teleporting away and resustaining Featherwind if the enemies are actually dangerous.

Extra class points should be spent in Arcane Vortex, 1 point into some of the sustains in the Phantasm Category is another option.  I don't think it's a particularly good one though.  Keep in mind generally the first few points into the arcane direct damage talents give better returns than the last few, to the point that increasing all of your secondary arcane damage abilities (everything other than Manathrust and Aether Breach) to 2-3 rather than one talent to 5 is a reasonably good strategy.

Tactics don't really change at this point except that you should be a hell of a lot more resilient, it does require a full 5 points to truly shine.  It can sometimes be found on items at higher than 5 power and is worth sacrificing a bit to wear if you do find one of these.

1333847808.0,rymnw,Don't buy Hack Slash Loot.,Bel_Marmaduk,94,54,90,"Here's why:

1. Controls are incredibly shitty. There is a huge delay between each on-screen action as bad animations and sound effects play. This completely breaks flow - while you would think that this would help you take more time to make better decisions

2.  'Camera' perspective makes it impossible to tell where you are in relation to other sprites. This will end up with you often taking a hit when you didn't expect to. While this would normally not be a problem

3. There is no way to heal HP other than consumable use, so RNG solely dictates your success in the early levels moreso than an actual traditional roguelike, which rewards caution and macgyver-esque preparation. 

4. It's basically impossible to tell what's going on. Graphics are never the selling point for a roguelike, the relative location of enemies and what each enemy is and what it does. Color coding and extended ascii accomplishes this task in most roguelikes, and simple high-res tilesets accomplish it in others. Hack Slash Loot deliberately cribs the graphical style of Powder to such a degree that it feels like plagarism, but unlike Powder does not have the excuse of literally being a game limited to the platform constraints of a gameboy. The sprite artist seems to be the same one responsible for Realm of the Mad God, except Realm of the Mad God has the decency to outline sprites and put them in high-res environments. 

5. It's the most expensive indie roguelike to date and does not appropriately reflect the production values at all.

Dredmor had a lot of problems initially with pacing, at least play the demo first before you pitch money to the wrong kind of developers. I wish I had.

You may remember me from this post: [I beat Shiren the Wanderer on DS](http://redd.it/ug19v)
The last time around I did some grinding and built up a powerful weapon. This time around I stuck to a more traditional rogulike play style. I did NO grinding. I did not backtrack to prior levels. I only used weapons and items I found on the road. I got lucky and found a melding jar. The melding jar allows you to boost your weapon more quickly.
I was skeptical that it could be done on Shiren the Wanderer. The game seems to push you toward building up powerful weapons. But you can do it.
Some highlights:


* I beat the final boss using a doppelganger staff.
* I paralyzed the other monsters surrounding the final boss.
* I escaped 2 monster houses
* I survived being changed into a riceball and being slowed. I was surrounded by two monsters. I changed back in time to blitz them with a blastwave scroll.(damages all the monsters)
* I got lucky when a blacksmith upgraded my weapon. He gave it a two point boost instead of the usual one point boost.
* I was lucky to find the mastersword on an early level. I also found at least two airbless scrolls. They upgrade your weapon.

tl;dr to sign up: **SSH** into ancardia.us.to, [configure your SSH client](http://ancardia.us.to/#putty), then log in with your new account.

ADOM was not made with a public server in mind, so I've taken up the torch, and also added my improvements to the software.

Features:

For no good reason at all

[Autopsy home page](http://code.google.com/p/autopsy/)

How to use it:
It's a one-file script that you place in your morgue directory and run. You  need Python 2.7 installed on your system. The script will create a log file that contains your game time info. I should run on Windows, though I've only tested on Windows. If you run it on any system, please leave some feedback. Obviously this will only work if you have your morgue files locally, so if you only play on akrasiac or another server this won't be very useful.

Leery of running some yahoo's strange script on your machine? You probably should be. The nice thing about Python being an interpreted language, you can create a temporary copy of your directory and run the script there. The files are opened with read-only access.

Right now it's pretty limited in its functionality as it only reports game time information: how long you've played, however, in hearing what other information people would like to see. Now that the necessary bits are in place to read all the files, create a log, etc, it's just a matter of implementing new stats. Things like:

* Number of runes collected
* Common causes of death
* Breakdown of races/backgrounds played
* Win ratio (bahaha)

A few final thoughts:
**Does something like this already exist?** I may be reinventing the wheel
**What else would you like to see?** If it's in the morgue file
**Am I doing something stupid?** If you know Python and see something face-palmingly dumb in the script
**Did it work and/or crash?** That would be useful information. You can either file a bug using the slick interface on the Google code page or list it here.

This is a guide on playing the Halfling Berzerker. [Here's my tournament profile](http://crawl.akrasiac.org/tourney10/players/jaeger.html). A lot of how I got in second place is due to my strategy of playing HaBe.

The moment you begin the game turn off training in Armour and in Axes. You won't be needing either of these. Early game is spectacularly consistent

Pick up and wield the first short blade, with proper caution.

When you see something difficult, however, it is still a resource you have to manage. 

Say you have an ogre tailing you. You definitely want to berzerk to kill it, a kobold, and a hobgoblin, then you would have a great opportunity to berzerk. You get to kill all four at little cost. This is actually a safety tactic, because it ensures those monsters won't be around _after_ the berzerk ends and you are vulnerable. By the way, you can berzerk against jellies, but switch to a weapon you don't want damaged first

Use the general smart tactics against ranged attackers. If you see an orc priest, then wait one square away from the corner. This way he'll only have a single turn during which he had a range advantage over you. You should let stealth train, so that you can setup battles in your favor.

Anytime you aren't hungry sacrifice every corpse to Trog. You eat less than other races

You should pick up any buckler you find along the way

In Lair you should be making your stash and testing scrolls and potions. My rule of thumb for the ID mini-game is to test very high frequency potions right away, and bring them back to the stash to test when you have the appropriate quantity.

The play order of branches you should follow is: Lair, Vaults until you find Crypt, almost all of Crypt (you can back out if liches scare you, though berzerkers fare pretty well), then Swamp/Snake/Shoals/Hive if you have rPois (but don't finish them, as the last levels are dangerous). I like to do Elf:1-6 after that. Elf:7 isn't recommended until much later.

Ever since you were a tiny lizzardling cub it has all been the same. Growing up, the guy everyone picks at.

As time passed you watched both your brainer and brawnier brethren pass you by. Night after night you have curled up, of greatness, of one day surpassing every one of your tormentors. But then, during one particularly long and sleepless winter night, it struck you. There's a way to turn this around and show them what you are capable of, what you desire! You must become a true dragon.

Ah, plunder them, kill them! One day your name will be widely spread and feared by all. You will become the dragon.

Much of your energy from this day on is spent on long hours of studying. You decide to learn the art of transmutation, cheap brandy and pretzels for Goralf.

And still this apprenticeship of yours yield little. You trudge away catering to the every need of this grumpy old fool

And so one day

""*You are not even strong enough to end a poor old man like me, and coughs in pain.

""*There is but one solution for you now. You must meet your faith in order to fullfill your dreams. Take the book! Head for the dungeon! Go now for you will never again face naught but cold hard justice in this town*""

**RULES:**

* You must enter the Dungeon as a DrTm.

* You must learn Dragon Form and get it down to 10% failure rate or below in order for your score to count.

* You must not worship a good god

* You must not use up your wealth. A dragon seeks to amass a glorious stash of gold and jewels

**FAQ:**

**Q: How do i participate?**

A: Abide the rules and post your result here or in the End of week 84 thread that will appear on sunday. 

**Q: I don't like dragons

A: Lol. Everyone likes dragons. 

**Q: What if no one manages to learn Dragon Form well enough? Will that be the end of weekly challenges forever?**

A: Well

**Q: Is Goralf in any way related to Crazy Yiuf?**

A: Yes, but Goralfs mother - Yiufs aunt - married a draconian man, so that makes Goralf a dracgnollian. And yes, that is the actuall term.",,False,,False,t3_1dcsik

I basically have never played any roguelikes except Azure Dreams for the Playstation(again, so my experience is incredibly... low. I looked around but it seems most of the ""what are good beginner ones?"" posts are at least a few months old and, while I took glances at them, I still wouldn't mind some up to date opinions, especially based off possible new releases/updates.

As blasphemous as it might be to say on here, I'd certainly prefer some with at least some graphics, even if it's ""tilesets"" like the ones in various Dwarf Fortress mods, though the better the graphics, such as in FTL, the... well, better! Don't think I'm saying I prefer graphics over gameplay at all, since above all creativity is my biggest draw to a game, the more I'd enjoy it most likely.

1344611707.0,xzzpp,I've decided to start keeping a diary for my characters.,Fushigidane,35,5,22,"EDIT: This is for DCSS

I'm typing them up in a text document as I go at the end of each 'day'. I consider any area I traveled and the experiences I had in them for the diary trying to remember that anyone entering the dungeon would act as if he knew nothing about it. Each 'day' ends after I've descended to a new unexplored floor. This is my first entry for my demon-spawn berserker. Naturally

Day 1 D:2 - A good start to my exploration. I found some armor. I also found a feathered hat and gloves. Most demons think these human frivilties as junk, though, but I've decided to bring them along with my 3 daggers. Hungry.

Day 2 D:3 - What a great start! I did battle with a human female magic user named Jessica and later an imp named Ijyb. To my surprise I've found that when I am in danger I sometimes can summon a minion
seems to sap the life from those I hit. It's not very strong otherwise

Day 3 D:4 - Challenges abound! Yesterday I used the term 'imp' jokingly, a peon who used to torture those unfortunate enough to cross into our dimension. Very dangerous indeed... for the weak. I found a temple with many altars. Ridiculous idea. Trog is the one true god, except maybe Logonu. I'd smash their altars if I had time.

Day 4 D:5 - Who in their right mind sets up stores in a dungeon? Madness. I didn't get a good look at the shopkeepers; they kept themselves hidden behind a cloak, even a berserker, needs his rest. However, I enjoyed the challenge. I was faced by a bloated toad named Prince Ribbit and a kobold with human slaves by the name of Pikel. They teamed up on me, but I got some minions of my own. The slaves were happy to be free of their master, but, at the time I was too hungry and exauhsted to kill them. They wander free for now. I later also did battle with another human magic user named Menkaure. She fell quickly.

Day 5 D:6 - This last floor was mostly boring. Found a weird helmet with wings coming off the side. Meh. Hungry.

Day 6 D:7 - I encountered a lot of zombies today. They just kept coming! My minions took care of them though. More interesting

First ever ascension

I'm pretty proud of this, but on Zig:18 I got a Pan Lord floor which really kicked my ass and forced me to random tele/semi-controlled blink to the exit, apport the good looking loot and jump down to Zig:19 only to find an even worse floor, so I decided not to risk my first win.

Mummies are, and when you get Orb of Destruction as well you can really tear through almost anything short of Zig5, Crypt and Pan Lords until you get Fire Storm castable. You never have to worry about food, so you can scum Abyss all you want relatively safely, which more than makes up for the terrible skill aptitudes. The downside is ultra-lategame you seem to cap out earlier than I think other characters do - your low stat gain means that even at XL27/27 spellcasting/27 fire magic you'll probably only have ~30 int even with items included, which still gives a ~6% fail rate for fire storm, and you don't have quite the HP or mana pools of other characters. Plus, necromutation is better very late on as you can restore lost stats or avoid dispel undead/holy attacks.

I'm floaty-happy right now, an unidentified axe (of quietus it turns out, used it 'til the end of the game) a slew of enchant scrolls and a lightning staff, I knew it was time to make my own luck.  I dumped the enchants into the staff and went for it.  The game eventually did start throwing plate armors at and finally some rings, but I found I leaned most heavily on the lightning staff.  At times I was wandering around with five tentacle horrors, the tensest moment was a face to face battle with a dragon, ended up killing most of my horrors.  After that, I just walked on down

Maybe it's time to get serious about DCSS, finally, I'll be ready for nethack.

My game is a squad/turn based Roguelikish (link below, position swapping, covering fire, decisions of that nature. Having just released alpha version 0.4, I've had some time to reflect on the direction my game is headed in.

The number one complaint about my game is that it is tedious and frustrating to move the squad (consisting of a maximum of four characters) across the map. This tells me (and I could be looking at this the wrong way) that there is too much ""dead space"" in my dungeon layouts where the player is simply exploring and nothing of note is really going on like fighting or going after shiny objects.

One way to fix the tedium is to have squad members auto-follow a leader when a explore mode is toggled. Another is to collapse the squad onto one avatar in explore mode and disallow combat while in that mode.

An  obvious and cheap way of fixing this is to spawn more enemies and to do so dynamically. I'd rather not do this. Early on I had open maps with hordes of monsters swarming the squad. While hectic and fun

What I'd like is a more claustrophobic

So really my questions are

I think the following would  help:

 - Add hidden rooms/objects. But then I'd need a mechanic to uncover them. I'm not entirely sure how well this would work in my game.

 - Mini-bosses that are fast and aggressive (i.e. death to the stragglers).

 - Traps. I'm not sure how a squad walking into a trap would be better than just one person. Maybe flood an area with lava so that it would actually be better to send only one scout ahead?

 - Monster Ambushes that would kill one or two squad members

 - Critical failures. Maybe a squib round blows up in your face

 - Limiting ammunition and forcing players to melee. Currently the squad consists of more furturistic type characters thrown into a world of low tech and magic. Melee attacks are very low damage and currently don't have any effects like knockback. But limiting ammunition may encourage players to melee weaker enemies in order to save ammunition for tougher enemies. This has the perhaps unfortunate side effect of encouraging the player to send the ammoless character into a possible death trap to test the waters.

 - Specific enemy attacks designed to chip away at squad health instead of kill anyone outright. Possibly a cheap option that takes control out of the player's hands. Think of a Frost Troll charging - it powers up then the next turn slams through every tile in some line.

 - Monsters currently only get one Action Point (basically one move or one attack) per turn. Higher level monsters will have more to draw upon which should make the player more wary of running into a room.

 - Squad based abilities. I haven't implemented anything like this yet. Shows you how smart I am

 - I have formations implemented (i.e. standing in a square boosts squad defense) but it's a crappy mechanic. I mean this sincerely as the guy who wrote the code. No one uses it. Even I don't use it. It's much more a, but I think that's just my bias for not wanting to throw away code.


Okay, your game sucks, and your knowledge of Roguelikes sucks!"", is appreciated. Really. Often times you don't know what you don't know. Feel free to tell me to just suck it up and make an auto-explore mechanic because it's the cat's ass.

High Elf Wizard of Vehumet

I found a book with fireball and a ring of fire really early on, and ice beast/ice could whatever was still alive.  After I could cast fire storm I starting using it as my main damage source, relying on gourmand to keep my food up.

Killing Mennas made me happy &gt;:D  The only other time I ran into him with a wizard I tried to fight him and ended up almost dying twice.  This time I had fire storm.

I almost died a few times, the first time I ended up manaless next to an arch lich and had to tele again.  I landed by exit stairs that time, luckily.)

The Orb run was a lot easier than I feared.  Most levels I walked through uneventfully (maybe stealth helped?)  I did have a scuffle with a demon thing and had to randomly blink a lot to get up the stairs without him.





**My Background:**

I've been playing DCSS off and on for around 6 months with little success (never got much past the Lair entrance.)  I tried a few combinations

This past week

Also I think trying out Vehumet instead of my usual choice of Sif Muna helped.  The extra mana from kills and cheaper fire storm was invaluable.  I really liked being able to switch out spells at will

I started trying a CK because I was looking for an interesting character to try

This is the second character I have gotten a 15 rune win on (the first being an OpMo of TSO).  I learned a lot of important lessons playing this character too.  I am never ever doing the Tomb again unless I have statue form castable, but I had to use up almost all the available healing in the game to undo all the rot curses I racked up.  I guess the other big lesson was to never underestimate Xom's fickleness, carelessness in his actions nearly killed me several times.

Now for what everyone wants to hear about an extended CK endgame:  how much did Xom mess with you?  Short answer

GOOD actions

-Giving me the effects of a potion of experience on D8-10 or so

-Gifting me a wand of Heal Wounds (the only one I found all game until Zot 3-4).

-Confusing one of the rune guarding bosses of Pand mid fight

-Extremely good mutation set for most of the game.  At one point I had free rElec, +6AC, +20% max hp, clarity, regen, with only a few minor bad ones like blurry vision.  I also spent most of the extended endgame with free rMut, although by then I had lost most of my other good mutations.

BAD actions

-Teleporting me in LoS of about 20-30 mummies including many greater and priests on Tomb 3.  He then swapped me out of my fog scroll immediately, going down to 20~ hp a few times.  He also swapped me on my final way out into a worse position...man did he ever want me dead in the Tomb.  Also right after I finished escaping and clearing the stairs he cast necromutation on me....where was that when I desperately needed it in LoS of 12+ guys who torment you Xom?!

-While fighting Ereshkigal he teleported me away when she was low

-Teleporting me in LoS of 2 Orbs of Fire on Zot 5, only to have my weapon swapped for a draconian's and me not realize it immediately, so I had to teleport again.  Barely escaped with my life and managed to find my weapon using my backup one.  Xom also animated/swapped my weapon during several tense battles...definitely one of his most devastating abilities.

-On D1 during my ascension he tried one last time to do me in

Some other things of note in the run are the fact I found very few decent cloaks all game, but no demon blade was found either.  Pretty bizarre item shortage overall, but I persevered.  I had a lot of stupidly good items regardless so I can't really complain much.

In any case, so try a CK yourself if you need some added insanity in your DCSS.  If anyone has any interesting sounding race/background combinations let me know since I am looking for my next character and don't really have many ideas yet.  So far I have won with DECj, OpMo, MuAK, DSSk, SpEn, TrWr, with 1 pure caster.  I haven't tried a ranged weapon user yet (throwing on TrWr closest) so maybe one of those,,False

What keeps me coming back is knowing that (for the most part) i'm going to get a different experience every time. It's the unpredictably that most roguelikes share that I just LOVE. It seems that the industry is full of boring, even at times of extreme frustration, games like Brogue, FTL, DF (adv. mode) always impress me with the fairness, and balance they can have, while still being tough as hell.

Sorry for rambling a bit there, what keeps you coming back, and also, what do you think the future of the genre is?

1595145 Soren the Sorcerer (level 27
             Began as a Spriggan Enchanter on July 29
             Was the Champion of Kikubaaqudgha.
             Escaped with the Orb
             ... and 4 runes (of 4 types) on Aug 3
             
             The game lasted 15:15:33 (140490 turns).

Spriggan enchanter is fun and very effective

Thanks to everyone in #rrogue for their support! I'd have most likely died a horrible death if it wasn't for the good advice there.

**Game Highlights:**

stabbing is fun:  
 &gt; 2869 | D:3      | Noticed Terence  
 &gt; 2871 | D:3      | Noticed Sigmund  
 &gt; 2877 | D:3      | Defeated Sigmund  
&gt;  2879 | D:3      | Defeated Terence  


Nothing like coming back later to take care of unfinished business (note the turn counts):    
&gt;  39034 | D:15     | Noticed Roxanne  
&gt; 112456 | D:15     | Defeated Roxanne  


One of the two uniques that I decided not to kill:  
&gt;  51739 | Vault:4  | Noticed Mara  

The other one? well...

SO YOU WANT YOUR FIRST RUNE? LOL NOPE HERES BORIS  
&gt;  71313 | Shoals:5 | Noticed Boris     
&gt; 71510 | Shoals:5 | Got a barnacled rune of Zot    
&gt; 71510 | Shoals:5 | HP: 7/140 [Boris/iron shot (44)]      

I was happily invisistabbing the entire merfolk population when Boris showed up and woke up everyone in the room with the rune. I barely escaped with my life and never looked back.    


So I was feeling kind of cocky and decided to clear Elf:5. It was certainly no cakewalk
&gt;  82649 | Elf:5    | Cast into the Abyss (deep elf high priest)     
&gt;  84003 | Abyss    | Got an abyssal rune of Zot    
&gt;  86000 | Elf:5    | You pass through the gate.       

I was certainly not expecting to find the rune so quickly


After that


Also
&gt; 101426 | D:25     | Noticed a toenail golem    
&gt; 101426 | D:25     | Noticed a toenail golem    
&gt; 101426 | D:25     | Noticed Erolcha    
&gt; 101426 | D:25     | Noticed a toenail golem    
&gt; 101426 | D:25     | Noticed a toenail golem   

Yep...      


Zot was tough
   
Also
1. Shadow Creatures can summon moths of wrath in Zot.  
2. Moths of wrath can cause their enemies to go berserk.  
3. Berserked Orb Guardians are horrifyingly scary.   
From then on


And
&gt; 139760 | Zot:5    | Got the Orb of Zot   
&gt; 140490 | D:$      | Escaped with the Orb!

**Part 3: Hungry Skeletons**

YouTube Video:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=cwRo_kM19Ek

Today I'm going to talk about some behaviours that are specific to the Skeleton monster. The idea is that while Skeletons are not chasing or pursuing the player, consumed corpses turn into more undead Skeletons! We build upon all of the behaviours discussed in the previous articles to do this.

The procedure is as follows:

1 .The Skeleton is in non-alert mode (character is not in line of sight

2 . If a player is detected

3 . When the Skeleton reaches the corpse, this is to give the impression that the Skeletons are busy eating to notice much else. Also, it is still in non-alert mode and will not smell any breadcrumbs. This opens up gameplay opportunities such as sneaking around a group of Skeletons who are busy munching!

4 . When the eaten variable exceeds a certain amount (ie. 200) the corpse is completely consumed. At this point some corpses (such as Orc corpses) turn into more Skeletons! This has the effect of a large cluster of corpses quickly propagating into multiple Skeletons

5 . At that's it

I've put up a public telnet server that hosts ""Infinite Cave Adventure""

Connect with any telnet client to host **diggr.name**

I've attempted to make a roguelike that shifts away from roleplaying towards boardgames and strategy games. 

Some highlights:

* 'Grinding' is impossible or pointless.
* No experience points
* A very limited inventory that makes stockpiling impossible. Choosing what gear to keep and what to discard is a major strategic choice in the game.
* A steep 'ramping' of power levels and an aggressive hunger clock makes the game fast-paced.
* Each level is different in flavor in strategy

The game is open-source

It is written in C++, be easy.)

Then I launch a fireball across the lake ( [lucky screenshot captured this gorgeous Kodak Moment](http://i.imgur.com/ktnKL.jpg) ).

The first shot only damaged one goblin a little (it was standing in water)

This plan was a triumph. [Everyone died](http://i.imgur.com/ndRWc.jpg).

(**Do not try this at home**. Do not test potions in swampgas unless you've already IDed *Potion of Incineration*. Wash thoroughly in case of accidental contact. Be aware that lighting gas gives blast damage as well as fire damage.)

Unknown to me the swamp gas extended through a door to the north and ended up lighting another fungus fire

I'm playing MiBE for quite a long time since I just want to beat this game for once. This time 'Lucky' really gets lucky. I basically get artifacts on all slots and got some good mutation resistant after drinking potion of mutation and potions of cure mutation some times.
After picking the Orb of Zot it is much easier than I expected. I've got a boot of speed and wand of digging I didn't meet any tough enemy.

I'm just so happy now! Now it's time to play some badass magician! Good look crawling!  ",,t5_2rhpi,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikes/comments/163vi7/dcss_first_win/

Nerves settled once again

Prove your chosen race is the best!

**Rules**: The rules are simple. Play as either a lava orc, and I'll also post a thread sometime Saturday as a last call of sorts. On Sunday (in that thread) I'll declare the winner, and they can create the next challenge.

You can **[download trunk here](http://crawl.develz.org/trunk/)**

---

Here's a brief rundown of each race:

**Gargoyle**: Gargoyles have rN+, Fangs 1, Talons 2, and Slow Metabolism 1. They are immune to being petrified, but can elect to petrify themselves.

**Djinni**: Djinn have total immunity to all fire and hellfire, and three to get rC+, which is their maximum. Instead of HP and MP bars, they have a single Essence bar. 1 MP costs two essence. Djinn do not need to eat, and instead pay hunger costs by gaining glow, but any mutations they get from glow are temporary. Djinn have to 'float' over water which slows them down, but they can float over deep water. They can pick up items in shallow water

**Lava Orc**: Lava Orcs have rF+, they gain (in this order, as temperature increases):

- Normal movement speed
- rF++; lava magic boost (currently just bolt of magma?); they lose stoneskin
- rF+++; rC-; fire magic boost
- Fast movement speed; burn attackers
- Burn surroundings; cannot read scrolls

Temperature increases based on tension (roughly speaking, or by entering lava. It lowers when you finish berzerking, enter water, or over time if not in a tense situation.",,False,,False,t3_1flut6

A few things I learned:

* Quick blades of pain are amazing.
* Slings are a cool choice for a Skald's ranged weapon
* Oka's wrath isn't that bad when you can blink out of it and run away.
* Pan really is easier than Hells
* Even when you have rF+++
* Regeneration (spell

* Control Undead is not as bad as the wiki makes it seem. Situational

You can download it here: http://t-o-m-e.net/download.php?tome_current=0 Be sure to download the binary, and has some bugs that I couldn't deal with.

I see so much on this reddit about ADOM, ToME is much more in-depth and complex. For instance, in ToME, you can: build magical items and craft artifacts; you can customize your character much more than in ADOM; there's a much larger overworld with many more places to explore; and many more NPCs with varied quests and nuances.

ToME is also longer. You can expect to build the same character in ToME for months or more. I've had characters in ToME that lasted more than a year. The power curve in both games seems pretty balanced, you will have battled balrogs and other greater demons, armies of great wyrm dragons, Sauron, and defeated Morgoth (Sauron's dark god). You even have the choice at the end to gamble it and follow Morgoth's beaten soul into the void and destroy it forever - a nearly impossible feat.

**Places:**

The areas to explore are more varied and colorful. The ""dungeons"" are larger

* The Barrow Downs ""dungeon"" is generated to be made of various paths through trees and rocks

* Moria is made to be sections of winding stone caverns interspersed with dwarven structures and great halls.

* Mirkwood is generated to be like winding paths through dark forests

* You can go to the Heart of The Earth

* There's an underwater cave where you can die if you don't breathe water

* There's a castle of illusion with glass walls that slowly drives your character insane.

**Equipment:**

The equipment system is nearly limitless. If you like to collect gear in RPGs, Grond, that you can take from Morgoth after sending him into the void; each of the 3 Rings of Power; each of the 7 Rings of Power; each of the 9 Rings that you can take from the defeated bodies of the Nazgul (although, it's never a good idea to wear those ones); and, the One Ring, which is an entire strategy decision itself on whether to wear it when you get it, or to destroy it.

You can craft your own magical items

**Some screens:**

* *Chillin in Bree:* http://imgur.com/rHexR.gif The windows surrounding my main view are extra terminals. You can turn these on from Window &gt; Visibility. Then, arrange your terminals however you like.

* *Examining an artifact:* http://imgur.com/EisSL.gif Here

* *Skills screen (for a hobbit assassin):* http://imgur.com/a4FsE.gif Somwhat similar to ADOM. As you level, you'll gain a little in weaponmastery, and a little less in combat, for instance. The numbers are: skill level [how much each spent point raises the skill]. There's also a special abilities list (""N"") that you can purchase for a set amount of skill points. Unlike skills, you don't improve on abilities - you buy them once, and you often have to save many levels worth of points to get them.

* *Exploring the Barrow Downs:* http://imgur.com/fY0Av.gif Notice that the dungeon is a winding maze made of forrest trees (the green blocks. They can be chopped with a bladed weapon, and tombs of man-made walls (the gray blocks). Each area in ToME has different level generation algorithms.

* *The overworld (with tile graphics):* http://www.t-o-m-e.net/wilderness-2.2.png

To give you an example of how the game can be, and then use all your new limbs to carry many magical swords, or wear all the Rings of Power at once. Or be a necromancer and resurrect a powerful unique enemy to be your undead slave - complete with all their powers in life.

1372524841.0,1hbfhr,"[DCSS] Weekly Challenge #89: Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger",ManMan91,7, judged by the following scoring system:

- Racial mutations (displayed in blue) do not count. We want to create a NEW race

- Bad mutations (displayed in red) subtract from your score. Each bad mutation subtracts 50, so quaffing a potion of mutation is still a good idea (well, probably...)

- Good mutations (displayed in light grey) add to your score. Each good mutation adds 500

- Multiple tiers of the same mutation stack, Claws 1 would give you 500,000 points, Claws 2 would give you 750,000 points (not 1,000,000),000, so that Dex -3 and Dex -5 would both subtract 100

- Mutations that stack with your base race's mutations (displayed in cyan or magenta for good and bad mutations respectively) are treated like they would be if you had acquired them as a human. For instance, Slow Movement 3 is treated as a tier 1 mutation for a Naga.

The above bonuses and penalties modify your normal crawl score - there's nothing like the quest for the Orb to prove the worth of your new race. Characters without at least one good mutation don't qualify.

Sources of good mutations include:

- Drawing the Helix card from the deck of Wonders or Changes will give you a random or a good mutation

- Xom will sometimes give you a bad

- Quaffing a potion of mutation will give you 3 random mutations

- Eating mutagenic chunks (from a sky beast

- Jivya grants unique mutations available only to its followers

- Quaffing potions of Gain Str/Dex/Int (0.12) or Beneficial Mutation (trunk)

Some sources of bad mutations (avoid these):

- THE MALMUTATE SPELL - I list this one first and in caps since this is by far the most common. Neqoxecs, but it works at any range, and it ignores magic resistance. If you're going into the Slime Pits, the Abyss or Pandemonium, make sure to have some form of protection from mutation. Note that an amulet of resist mutation is still only 90% effective.

- Magical contamination (gained from miscasts, etc.)

- Mutgenic attacks (from pulsating lumps and Mnoleg)

- Miscasting a high level transmutation spell sometimes gives bad mutations

- Mutagenic fog

(As an, wizmode in several games; in Nethack, anyway, it would be entirely possible to create any given set of equipment, stats, XL, and DL through wizmode, for some games

I'd love to see a roguelike that included the option for endgame problem studies. What if you could annotate certain turn numbers during the game that would only become accessible upon victory/ascension/whatever?  Or maybe, like the game conditions when you first picked up the Amulet of Yendor. Or maybe it would exclusively work like New Game+, where it requires you to have beat that game yourself to play previous saves. I think you could avoid the sensation of save scumming if you made it a requirement to beat the game before having access to saves, maintaining the challenge of ""fresh"" seeds but allowing for an alternate style of playing the game. 

Admittedly, the save files aren't so cumbersome that additional ones could be stored. And because of the way roguelikes are procedurally generated, it's impossible to create the same conditions for very long, depending on how the RNG advances. But it would be fun to create endgame problems for expert players, whereby a particularly difficult or absurd situation could be shared to compare notes on how to approach the situation best, etc.

All techniques demonstrated are implemented in my game **[TinyKeep](http://tinykeep.com)**


Interactive demos for Parts 1

http://tinykeep.com/ai


**Part 1 Improvements**

Before I crack on with Part 2

[Part 1.1 YouTube Demo](http://youtu.be/YttkpNdS5bY)

In short

1 . The co-ordinate of the last detected entity (either player character or breadcrumb) is saved as a variable every frame. So, he will still continue to head towards this last detected location as its final target and re-evaluate from there. This is an improvement from the previous version where a monster would stop and go back to patrolling even though it has detected a target in the past - which is not expected behaviour.

2 . If the Skeleton still cannot detect anything from this point (all raycasts to the player and breadcrumbs again return false), the best guess waypoint remains the same. I admit it's a little bit cheaty of the AI - since it now knows exactly where the character is in order to set the waypoint - but it works well and looks realistic enough because of its slow movement during non-alert patrol mode. Most players won't know the difference, it just looks like the the monster is heading in the general direction and its likely the player has moved on from this point anyway. Still - for completeness I may modify best guess to take into account the target's last seen velocity and extrapolate from there.

Given these changes, lest we give the impression that the AI is cheating all of the time! This also gives the player the opportunity to hide behind corners and ambush monsters walking past.

Let's move on to the fun stuff!


**TinyKeep AI System (Part 2 of 5) : Retreating and Defense**

Today we'll be following a little Fire Imp as we discuss Retreating and Defensive behaviours. Fire Imps (and other monsters marked with the ""Shy"" personality flag) will run away from the player if he gets too close. Put him in this level of distress for too long

[Part 2 YouTube Demo](http://youtu.be/dIBuIELYd4c)

1 . For the demo

2 . Like the Skeletons, Alert mode is turned on and the Fire Imp faces the target. It will continue to face the target while in Alert mode, as long as it can still see and smell the target. At this point the Fire Imp will not flee just yet - the target is not close enough to be a major threat, but it is alerted and wary, and constantly tracking you with its sight.

3 . While in Alert mode, rather than the other way around). The resultant vector is normalized and scaled to the Fire Imp's max speed, so now the monster is repelled away from the player if it gets too close.

4 . Unlike the Seek Behaviour, another monster etc.. We don't get this problem with Seeking, because the target is always the player, who is always in the an empty space. To prevent problems with getting stuck - we must increase the wall avoidance distance. The Fire Imp now follows the corridors and rooms rather getting stuck on them. This is also useful for when the Imp is stuck in a corner - it will slide nicely away if the player tries to advance further.

5 . Each monster has it's own type of defensive behaviours while retreating. For this demo, a cooldown period is activated before it breathes fire again.

And that's it! Quite simple reactive behaviour but effective. I did try to use some kind of pathfinding to accomplish fleeing but the results were buggy and there was a lot more consideration required to make it look realistic. In the end the reactive technique using Fleeing Steering Behaviour returned better results. The key takeaway with game AI is that a combination of simpler rules often work better than a monolithic and complicated top-down system. Also - exaggerate your behaviours! Make them look around often, if the player isn't given cues as to what is going on under the hood - the monsters will not SEEM intelligent.

Mine was a bit lame:  
I had the 1st layout Rock ship, board with 2 rocks, win.

Turns out the boss is weak against boarding (i had 6 crewmembers

Fight 1: Teleported first 2 rocks into the 3rd room (this one shoots missiles), the ship will be just floating there, unable to attack - infact it cant hurt you if you just take out the 3rd missile room. After the rocks have finished smashing the weapon rooms, tele back, heal. Then hit their engines with missiles(to reduce their avoid chance to zero), until they had 3 HP left. After this one more missile into the medbay, and 3 rocks + a human guy ports in. Their main area has 7 crew, the AI takes over the ship...which will autorepair everything. Dont wanna wait for that

Fight 2:  
Now the ship has no crew, but actually this is his biggest flaw too. Plus i have no missiles left... I send one rock to the missile bay again, two to the droid room. the others stay at the ship to fight the assault droid for now. If the ship uses its special ability, i cloak, thus negating all damage. after a few seconds, the missile bay is down again, same for the droid bay, my rocks start to hit it again. If it gets destroyed the ship loses 1 HP...so its checkmate again. Since i have no missiles one of the rocks must stay on the ship to finish it... sadly he dies if the fight ends.

Fight 3:
After a repair (and getting 5 missiles) Same technique as before, smash again. I needed those missiles to tear down the super shield, because it prevent teleport.

 I don't really care about only seeing the beginning if it's interesting, there's a lot of time that passes between interesting decisions, my impatience for which could cause a discrepancy between my experience and the readers of this question. I can't comment on whether seeing the mid-game or late-game would make me more interested in the roguelikes I've played because I haven't ever seen them, which may also cause such a discrepancy.

 I'm not sure that there is a roguelike that would be interesting to me, I'll accept that.

Edit: I asked about a roguelike that was fun for noobs because I will be a noob at the game when I start. I think I'll be pretty much okay tutorial-wise as long as I can understand whatever screen I'm seeing.


Edit 2: I've actually played a few more roguelikes than I've mentioned. Below is a list of the roguelikes I've played for a nontrivial amount of time

ADOM: All I remember is that I couldn't stand the setting of it as soon as I played it.
Desktop Dungeons: Couldn't find anything really that fun in it.
Crawl: Loved the focus on risk management and resource management

The Red Sonja dungeon sprint map: The only flaw I saw was that it got too repetitive when you played it multiple times with the same build due to you knowing exactly how to handle the point up to when you died. There might be some other reason that I didn't switch builds. Liked the discovery of how to handle the various rooms.
Dungeons of Dredmor: Alien to me in every way.
Nethack: Okay if I'm bored enough
Dwarf Fortress: Complex in areas that aren't as interesting to me as complexity in, but just not worth the effort it takes to learn how to play.

Sil is an Angband variant featuring a massive overhaul of the Angband engine to make an authentic Tolkienian dungeon crawling experience. It's the best variant I've ever played

Do not be fooled that this is an Angband variant - the developers have gone to great lengths to make this game intuitive, reworked user interaction, and consolidated redundant/pointless gameplay elements. The design philosophy is much like Crawl's, where everything has a purpose and nothing is wasted.

It has a great tutorial and an *excellent* manual that should be all you need to enjoy the game.

*Procedural content generation is one thing
days is player-generated content. How does it fit in roguelikes?*

Some time ago I heard someone propose a ""hardcore mode"" challenge for Minecraft: you only have one life
the savegame. Now this is something that works in roguelikes pretty
well... but would you really want to play Minecraft that way?

It seems that while in roguelikes you get pretty attached to your
character (and what he achieved)
there is something more involved. Threatening not only several hours'
play but also effect of several hours' *creative work* - developing
something way more complex than player's stats and inventory - seems
too harsh.

Or maybe I underestimate RL player's masochism?

- Do you know examples of Minecraft/DF-style building gameplay in
roguelikes? Or any gameplay that involves creativity?

I wouldn't say exploring and leveling up is creative. Some games allow
for digging (I always dig up a little storage area for a stash in
ADOM) and placing doors. There are things like pudding farming in
Nethack which seem a bit more creative but not very fun.

Are there any more express examples in existing games?

- Do you think allowing player so much creative freedom (DF-style
skills, would work?

One problem I see is that the game could become too much sandbox-like.
Maybe it could be possible to balance freedom with some of the usual
anti-farming measures - hunger/corruption/shortage of building
resources/doomsday clock/??? ",,t5_2rhpi,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikes/comments/dch7c/building_in_roguelikes_would_you_play_minecraft/

I can remember a few and I'm hoping others can chime in with playing tactics that help bring them further into the dungeon.

1.) It's almost universally worth quaffing and reading every scroll you come across in very immediate beginning of the game to attempt to identify them without waiting for scrolls of identify or being able to cast the spell

2.) Sometimes it might be worth quaffing that potion of mutation you're sitting on.  While there are plenty of mutations that will affect you in a negative fashion you might luck out and get one of the beneficial one.  I always pick up and keep all my potions of mutation and will quaff one everytime I pick up a potion of remove mutation.

3.) Hill Orc Priests usually just need to make it to the Orc Mines to see a serious power upgrade.  Be sure to pray over all/any fallen Orcs for piety.  If you run out of Orc followers you can always try to return to the Mines later; I've had some luck with finding more Orcs even after I've cleared the whole thing out thousands of turns before.

The initial thought behind the build was to be a guy with a bardiche and a shield. How does that work? Condensation Shield and Divine Shield from TSO (Turns out they don't stack too well

Mf was the logical choice because of good (great) aptitudes in Ice Magic an Polearms. Hunter is good for the earlygame imo

So I got Polearms to 26 and waited for Okawaru to give me a good Bardiche. The best he could muster was +1/+2 of venom, and +Dam on boots and gloves, so I went through about everything like a breeze.

I left Oka as planned, which I was saving for TSO. I enchanted a bardiche of chopping instead, and made it holy shortly after Crypt.

Thanks to the items, with the hopes of finding what I was lacking: a good ring with rF and a wand of healing. That meant I wanted to learn Ice Storm, with Ice Magic already at 27. So I trained Conjurations, I actually didn't know that I still hat 10% fail chance with both at 27 in my leather armour (I don't play many casters).

Went to a zig with a ring of wizardry

On level 13 I got banished by a draconian. (Possibly saved me from a stupid zig death ;)) I was also under penace for Ice storming unaware draconians. Should be more careful.

With the ring (rF++) I knew I could do Gehenna and handle Orbs of fire

The moment closest to death was probably in Pan, where about 5 fiends and a Pan Lord were waiting for me.

This is a game in the same vein as Kornel Kisielewicz's DoomRL and many other games which take a popular game, and occationally something completely different.

For Magicko

If you're going into this game blind, you've got a fair understanding of how the spells go together.

Apparently paradoxically, Magicko limits how ""fast"" you can construct spells, turning the system from a desperate keymashing game into a thought out attack.

At the cost of this is nearly all the atmosphere, and rarely needs.

Since like Magicka there's no leveling up, with no storyline or pregenerated obstacles, nothing's stopping a player from just figuring out an optimal attack, then diving. 

It's a rather short game, and shows that developers shouldn't be afraid to experiment in the fear that the result will be utterly broken, eg. Tome2's runecrafter.

Rather than rate it on some abstract scale, but I wasn't hooked enough to try again on a harder difficulty.

Mine just happened (which prompted this post). I was a level 12 troll monk of Trog and had up to this point annihilated everything in my path. I had just cleared the orc mines and decided to peek at floor 13 for some scattered loot or treasure. Immediately upon descending, paralyzing me. As I'm frozen, a wolf spider zombie, giant toad, and wyvern zombie amble out of nowhere and proceed to gang rape me while I am frozen.

A spore then floats by and explodes on the giant wasp and me, horribly poisoned troll in the middle of the zombie gangbang and STEALS ALL 4 OF MY GODDAMN POTIONS OF HEAL WOUNDS, turns invisible and presumably joins in on the rape. My paralysis finally wears off and I have 5 hp, am severely poisoned, confused, and lack any source of healing.

1374051511.0,1ih4dp,[DCSS] YAVP Lava Orc Skald - full breakdown inside,Mdnthrvst,25,4,6,"http://pastebin.com/1PYmAB90

I quit at 3 runes because of a complete and utter lack of rCorr and rMut anywhere at all, and I'm not comfortable enough with LO to attempt extended, especially since the Forest spawned and not the Crypt, preventing risk-free max TSO piety.

Anyway

The Skald spellbook itself

I was insanely lucky to find Minor Magic in the Lair, and everything that didn't suck I couldn't use, apart from a decent longbow. RMsl is one of the best spells in the game and I would've been perforated by any number of Giants, Centaurs or Yaktaurs without it.

I made a significant waste of heal wounds charges in Vaults: 5, namely, charging into a confrontation without a full magic pool, which is always necessary on Skalds.

Ring of Magical Power never left my finger through the entire game; by the end I had 50 MP

Infusion is superior to Song of Slaying at low spellpower

I don't understand why Spectral Weapon and Tumika's Dance are different spells. It's ridiculous. They're the exact same thing except one is incorporeal. That said

Chargin' up Heroism/Slaying/Shroud/RMsl/Spectral/Shielding (along with Regen/Haste/Finesse during insanely tough situations) with a well-enchanted max-rank weapon more than makes up for a lack of pure melee AC/EV (I don't think Ozo's Armor works with LO temperature gain

Mennas doesn't Silence you 100% of the time and Spectral Weapon is the most important thing to cast during that window of time.

Fuck Mennas.

Can't stress this enough - never enter a fight without your buffs or without enough MP (20 or so) to quickly pull off your Super Saiyan charge-up as enemies approach.

Spam Regen after every tough fight once it's hungerless. Speeds up midgame healing tremendously.

LO high-temp reading prevention didn't bother me much - three or four times I noticed it, this may be a problem, but you do have free Swiftness and ambient fire AoE at high Tension. It seems like a fair trade, but of course your mileage may vary. 

I used Song of Shielding too much - it is expensive as hell and you *will* lose all of your MP from a single cast. This prevents emergency Regen or SCBlink during fights that go sideways. I should have used it as a last-resort instead of including it in my pre-fight lineup

Not a Skald thing in particular, run back and grab all of your shit. You will need it for the Orb Chamber, but Draconians will burn and freeze most of it if you carry it on your first way down.

Elemental Evokers need to be used carefully if you follow  Okawaru - spamming the half-dozen or so lamps and fans I'd collected in the Orb Chamber

Lacking rElec was the roughest part of Zot by far - a surprise Storm Dragon brought me to 17 health just before the Orb itself, you read that right. Everyone is so preoccupied by Orbs of Fire that they sort of ignore an almost bigger danger in the abundance of Electrical enemies in that place.

The Orb run was uneventful

The only rule for this challenge is that you may not ever step foot in the lair of beasts. The implications are many.

First

Second, as the realms beyond the standard dungeon are fraught with danger.

Perhaps the two most straightforward runes to attain will be the Iron rune located in the City of Dis and the Abyssal rune found in the endless expanse of the Abyss. The Abyss is a boring place though, as they will be protected in large part from torment symbols. Followers of the Shining One will, in any case, find their god's powers extremely useful.

The greatest trial will be surviving to that point. Without the experience of the Lair

**Shiren the Wanderer**- Quests that are completed open up the path to goodies, and bonus dungeons. (probably my favorite use of permanence in roguelikes)

**Desktop Dungeons**- If you meet certain objectives you unlock new dungeons

**Dwarf Fortress** - Ruined fortresses are explorable in Adventure mode and also cataloged within the map.

**I'm happy to share with you the latest build of Dungeonmans


[Latest version here](http://www.dungeonmans.com/?page_id=290)


It requires the XNA 4.0 Redistributable


Dungeonmans is a lighthearted 2D roguelike set in a persistent world of high adventure that grows and evolves as you play. Explore untamed wilds, and roll around in piles of shiny loot. Currently in Dungeonmans is available for Windows.


Combat in Dungeonmans is about tactics, cones, dashes, and other area effect attacks that reward players who think ahead and seize opportunity. Hero development is free form as you can pick from a variety of Masteries to build exactly the character you want. Start with a base class to get your settled in, or just grab a handful of points and a backpack of loot and build a class yourself.


I've been putting out new builds around once a week


Every Dungeonmans is a graduate from the Dungeonmans Academy, lost knowledge, or trophies ripped out of the toughest monsters. These items can be used to upgrade the Academy and provide you with bonuses to your existing character and future graduates as well! Each heroically slain Dungeonmans can add power and knowledge to the Academy, driving the player ever forward to victory!


I hope you download the game and give it a spin. If you like it


I'd be happy to answer any questions about development

For this week's challenge

***

**Rules:**

* Start with Zin
* You must collect all runes and finish the game with Zin. 
* You may switch to the TSO or Elyvilon temporarily

The winner is the player with the highest score by next Sunday afternoon

***

Here's a highlight of Zin's features:

**Piety**: Zin takes a tithe of 10% of your gold and converts it to piety. This stops at max piety. Gold is somewhat hard to come by in the early game

**Vitalisation** - Protects you from nearly every status effect except for slow. (sickness, paralysis, confusion, petrification, rot, and stat drain) 

It also boosts all your STR

It also gives a small amount of nutrition

This is Zin's best ability (in my opinion). Use it early and often

**Early uses**: Adders/Ants (Poison), and most if not all Unique/Named mobs

Later it can also help deal with mummy curses

**[Recite](http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Zin#Recite)**: Inflicts status effects and/or damage to things that Zin doesn't like, or cancel it. Afterwards you are out of Breath, and must recover to use Recite again.

It's tricky to use

**Mutation Protection**: Your percentage to resist mutations increases to 100% and grows with your Piety. Zin also has a one-time use ability to remove all of your mutations

**Imprison**: This ability surrounds a monster in a 3x3 silver walled prison for a number of turns. There must be empty space surrounding the monster to be able to create the walls. 

Use this to stop single threats from attacking with a larger group

Best targets: Fiends, Out of Depth monsters 

**[Sanctuary](http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Zin#Given_Abilities)**: One of the best panic buttons in the game. This creates a temporary halo around you which monsters run away from

You can not attack an enemy without dispelling the sanctuary, and you can also use Recite without breaking it.

**Hell-Effect Protection**: Your percentage to resist the effects of hell while exploring it's branches increases to 100% and grows with your Piety. This lets you rest and recover in branches where you typically have to move as quickly as possible to avoid all the terrible effects of the various hells.

Start with: 24 agility, with the remaining points spent on one more thing of your chosing (multi-legged is a great choice, and so is phasing, but its up to you). As for starting path, the pistol path is good, but so is the tinkerer path for starting with some basic crafting skills.

As you level, enemies won't be hitting you much. And with Triple Jointed you'll be raising your agility (which raises your dodge value and ranged accuracy) as well as giving a flat percentage-chance-to-dodge all attacks. 

End result: The enemy will only be hitting you on natural 20s

 It allows you to play a variety of games (Nethack, ToME, and others) within a browser just by logging in saving you the trouble of downloading some of your favorite games, and keeps your session stored so that you can log in on any other computer and access your session and continue.

 It is still very much so in Beta, but it is a planned feature. He is very open to comments and suggestions to help build this project.

**Highlights:**
I started with good stats and enough talents to get my Heir gift (adamantium dagger of penetration) which kicked loads of ass and definitely helped get me out of the early game. Seriously

I got very lucky and was able to pacify the Big Room super early

Got stuck for a long time with no Amulet of Lifesaving for Khelevaster. But (again) finally got lucky with a blessed potion of exchange and a stack of 8 rings of something. Nothing smells like victory like a stack of 8 blessed rings of djinni summoning. I used the wishes on seven league boots, PoGA's, etc. This is why I never, ever sell or drop rings. Just let them pile up.

I cleared a Greater Karmic Vault, but with all those wishes it was a pretty straightforward run. Pretty satisfying, I'd been working on this character for a few months.

1294643205.0,eze1m,I'd like some opinions about a feature I'm adding to a roguelike project.,onewayout,23,3,47,"**Edit 1:** Wow

**Edit 2:** I've put up a [development blog](http://colony.barkingdoginteractive.com/) where you can follow along as we develop.  *Fair warning: programmer art ahead.*  If your eyes bleed

----

I'm tinkering on a roguelike game at the moment

The crafting system will involve finding the raw ingredients for making objects

**Option One** is to have a crafting system where you start the game knowing all the things you can craft, how to create it, and what he needs to find to create what he wants.  The focus is on strategic crafting.

**Option Two** is to have a ""discoverable"" crafting system

On one hand

On the other hand, but they don't!"" sorts of situations.

So

**Option Three** is a hybrid of the two

**Option Four** is an on-the-fly listing of craftable items based on items you have.  This would tell you what you can craft *at any given time*

**Option Five** would be to list, but not the entire recipe.  This would allow things that can be craftable to be discoverable, but you still might need to get creative and/or lucky to get all ingredients.  This would also, I imagine, involve a lot of cross-referencing, which might be a dull proposition.

A sixth option, but I don't really like it because is not really conducive to the setting.  However, I'm open to advocacy for it, since it's possible to contrive anything (""You just had an idea for making an axe!"").

Thanks in advance for your thoughts.

**tl;dr** How should players discover recipes for a crafting system in a roguelike?

Hi everyone

So this is my first time posting in roguelikes (much less anywhere else on Reddit). I'd played nethack and ADOM a bit before and really liked them even though i was never quite good with them so i decided to give DCSS a try after seeing all the posts here. I have to say that i was very

So first my thoughts about the interace. I decided to try the tiled version because the tiles look pretty good to me actually

Now about my first game so far. I made my first character and jumped right in, my guy started with a wand of heal wounds. Another stroke of luck that i didnt really appreciate til later was finding a shrine to Elyvilon and becoming her worshipper. Being able to rejuice my wands has been a lifesaver! And my third stroke of luck was finding a wand of disintegration early on. I feel like i've actually gotten pretty far for my first playthrough. I managed to disintegrate Sigmund (a famous name i hear thrown around who seems to be the bane of beginning adventurers), some named slaver guy, and Prince Ribbit. I've just been going down through the dungeon killing enemies, finding loot, and now i'm at Dungeon Lvl 8 and my fighter is lvl 10 and he's still alive!... for now haha. I'm sure hard times are ahead though because i've permanently used up all my mana recharging my wand of healing as its been my only source of healing, as well as a recharge or two of my wand of disintegration.
