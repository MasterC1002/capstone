I've always wanted to be a writer but I haven't regularly done what writers do

I was really angry with myself and I couldn't resolve this double standard in my head. If I wanted to be a writer

After a lot of thinking about it

Then something hit me - what about my day job? I get up to go to work every single day to do a job that I don't like. I'm never late

So here's what I did.

I made writing my second job. 

1) I gave myself an interview

2) I set myself working hours (between 21:00-23:00). These could be switched but I had to give myself advanced warning. If it got to 20:30 and I decided I didn't want to write

3) I paid myself. For every hour I sat in my chair I gave myself some guilt-free money from my day job wages that I could spend on whatever the hell I wanted. I started off with a £1 / hour rate

Since starting this in October I've increased it to £3, but I'm proud of every single one, because they show that I've finally sat down and written something.

To finish, it just means you're scared. The more you write the easier it is to manage this feeling, even if you can never quite overcome it. Good luck everyone.

**Ex.** Johnny was a jackass. **(NO)**

**Ex.** Johnny walked past the table of otakus and flipped over the lunch tray at the end with a casual air. He didn't even bother looking over his shoulder as his victim stared after him with mashed potatoes in her lap. **(YES)**

* **Dialogue tags.** One of the most useful and contentious tricks of writing fiction prose, you don't even have to tag dialogue). Dialogue tags are not capitalized - they are an extension of the dialogue that comes before them. If you are continuing dialogue with a break in the middle for a dialogue tag, the previous piece of dialogue should be closed off by punctuation, usually a comma. 

**Ex.** ""How could you do this to me?!"" She sobbed. **(NO)**

**Ex.** ""This is the cruelest thing you have ever done

* **It's vs. its.** The former is a contraction of ""it is""

**Ex.** ""**It's** a boy.""

**Ex.** ""The dog played with **its** bone.""

* **You're vs. your.** Same issue. the former is a contraction of ""you are""

**Ex.** ""**You're** a coldblooded bastard

**Ex.** ""Hey

* **Names in dialogue.** 

**Example:** 

""Billy

""I don't know Jim

Listen to the people speaking around you. People don't usually use the names of others while speaking to them unless they are a) very angry

* **Mixed tense.** There are three major tenses used in writing: past, learn the difference. 

* **Mixed perspective.** There are two major perspectives utilized in writing: third person (either limited or omniscient), second person perspective is generally frowned upon by many editors and is notoriously difficult to pull off. 

* **-ly ending adverbs.** The lazy writer's friend. If you feel the urge to write the following, calmly, angrily, etc...

**Ex.** ""Quit using those goddamned -ly ending adverbs!"" Ronin said angrily. **(NO)**

**Ex.** Ronin held out a copy of *On Writing* as she stalked towards the fledgling writer. She brandished the book before the amateur's downward-cast eyes

[props to ohgobwhatisthis for a much better example than I provided]

* **Exposition dumps.** This is where the writer has a shit-ton of information that they need to convey to the reader, and characterization, they decide to just lump it into a paragraph. See [Basil Exposition.] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJR1H5tf5wE&amp;list=PL3315B59A64D820AB&amp;feature=iv&amp;annotation_id=annotation_536151&amp;src_vid=E-PIidaqCyU)

* **Overuse of passive voice.** As opposed to active voice, especially when dealing with narrative action. Sometimes passive voice is necessary due to the context of the scene, but in many cases it can be eliminated for the active voice in order to bring more vibrancy to a piece of writing.  

**Ex.** The proposed initiative to limit passive voice was being bitterly opposed by some writers. **(NO)**

**Ex.** Some writers stood in bitter opposition against the initiative to limit passive voice. **(YES)**

* **Lack of conflict.** You have 2, is a strong source of external conflict.

**Ex.** Boring short story – Wife thinks about how dull her life has become. Does nothing about it

**Ex.** Cool short story – Wife is abused or neglected by her husband

* **OVERUSE OF EXCLAMATION!!!!** No, an exclamation mark can be suitably removed in exchange for making the entire piece of dialogue stronger, and the all-caps YELLING dialogue can be replaced with the smoother, more stylish italics.

**Ex.** “OH MY GOD!” Christian exclaimed. “THERE ARE WAY TOO MANY FUCKING EXCLAMATION POINTS IN THIS STORY!! [LOUD NOISES!!!] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pdWAcK6Eh8)” **(NO)**

**Ex.** “Oh my God

* **Semicolon abuse**. Somewhere, and indiscriminate dashes lead to James Joyce. Given his notorious wordcount (or lack thereof) nobody wants that. So don't let it happen to you. Learn how to use irregular punctuation correctly. You have to master the rules before you can break them. 

* **Giving up because somebody said something mean about your writing.** Writing is a tough sport man. People always think of writers as these frilly guys (or gals) hanging out in coffee shops with their laptops and their fluffy cats

* **Not starting at all**. Common excuses: I have too much homework, I haven't finished my outline yet, I haven't finished worldbuilding yet, I'm not satisfied, I'm not ready, I can't do it. Suck it up and write. You're never going to be in perfect conditions. Your first drafts are always going to be shitty. Even Stephen King's first drafts are shitty. Just shut up and write. You can always fix it in post. 


So that's it. Keep these things in mind as you write

Love

&gt;I guarantee you that no modern story scheme, unless one of those old-fashioned plots is smuggled in somewhere. I don't praise plots as accurate representations of life, but as ways to keep readers reading. When I used to teach creative writing, I would tell the students to make their characters want something right away—even if it's only a glass of water. Characters paralyzed by the meaninglessness of modern life still have to drink water from time to time. One of my students wrote a story about a nun who got a piece of dental floss stuck between her lower left molars, and who couldn't get it out all day long. I thought that was wonderful. The story dealt with issues a lot more important than dental floss, but what kept readers going was anxiety about when the dental floss would finally be removed. Nobody could read that story without fishing around in his mouth with a finger.

Theft of Swords made audible's [2012 The Best of Everything Top 20 5-Star Listens List](http://www.audible.com/guestauthor/FiveStarListens_2011).  Which means my book is along side books by:

* Stephen King
* Nora Roberts
* J.R.R. Tolkien
*  Vince Flynn
* Ken Follett

You know...authors people have actually heard of.  Needless to say...it's really made my day.

1338149021.0,u7nit,The first rule of Write Club. [xpost from r/shutupandwrite],danceswithronin,452,55,74,"This week the writer's block is back. Like most writers, never opened.

I would take a picture of these things

**The first rule of Write Club is that no one gives a shit about your desk.** Your desk has nothing to do with your writing. Hemingway wrote in cafes. Stephen King started out at a child's desk that he could barely fit his gangly knees under. Grisham wrote on the subway on steno pads. Chee writes on trains in sleeper cars. Capote wrote in bed. Thomas Clayton Wolfe wrote on the top of a refrigerator. 

Try finding pictures of this. With the exception of Capote (that flamboyant bastard) you won't. That's because these people were too busy writing to have their pictures taken. 

**The second rule of Write Club is that you don't spend more time talking about writing than you spend writing.** Of course writers are going to talk about writing, maybe one day soon, maybe years from now - you are going to die.  So now is the moment you ask: do you want to be remembered as someone who talked about his unfinished novel a lot, or do you want to be remembered as a writer?

**The third rule of Write Club is that if you stop, and/or give up, based on criticism or laziness or the general inability to effectively manage your lifespan, the writing is over.** You can call yourself a writer if you sit around talking about notes and outlines and drinking and reading and musing, but writers do one thing: write. All the time. Short stories. Screenplays. Blogs. Articles. Stageplays. Novels. Writing prompts. Novellas. Books. No matter how shitty your writing is, if you are writing, then you are a writer. If you are not writing

**The fourth rule of Write Club is that there are only two guys to a story: you against yourself.**

**The fifth rule of Write Club: one story at a time.** Finish it

**Sixth rule of Write Club: Your tools don't matter.** Pens, cats, writing books, influential novels, highlighters, napkins, index cards, notebooks, iPads

**Seventh rule: Submissions will go on as long as they have to.** You can work on something for three hours or three years. But do not stop until you are finished with it

**Eighth rule of Write Club** - If this is your first night at Write Club

* How a character got there. Selective Omission of Detail is your friend, across the room and says, ""hey."" Leave it out. Scant exposition can be helpful, start in the middle of a scene, aka *in media res*.

* Names, not everybody needs a name, they can remain ""the pigeon guy"" for the duration of their 1-page appearance. Conversely, they can be ""Bruce."" Conversely again, they can have elaborate histories told in summary condensed. Look at *Catch-22* for innumerable incidental characters with carefully crafted histories that make their backstory serve as story-story.

* Adverbs. Yes, they don't have to do so ""flatly"" or ""tentatively"", especially if it is apparent by the language itself, you know? Also, I try to leave out any dialog tags whenever I can get away with it and it is apparent who is speaking.

* No need for instant subtext. I've learned not to be afraid of ""on the nose"" writing for early drafts

* Omission of Character Growth. We didn't have to see Wesley being trained by the Dread Pirate Roberts to understand how he got good at fencing. We simply had to understand he spent a number of years on a pirate ship being mentored (I'm speaking of the film, but on a larger scale.

* Telling vs. Showing. Deciding to just ""tell it out"" instead of dramatizing in scene can actually be an effective tool. Vonnegut would talk about things Kilgore Trout wrote that would be next-to-impossible to *actually write out* because they are so outlandish. Instead

After another nine months of tinkering based on her feedback, we submitted it to publishers on Sept 1st and had our first offer on Sept. 20th.  Three offers were made in total, and I went with Del Rey because I think they offered the best package to launch my (hopeful) new career.

It seems that many people in this subreddit as well organizations such as NaNoWriMo are encouraging this and I am not sure why.  As a composer, this confounds me and I would like to know how you feel about it. ",So_nat_a_composer,412,85,http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/15xahd/i_have_noticed_that_many_beginning_writers_are/

No composition teacher would recommend that a beginning composer write a symphony. The idea is laughable to say the least. A symphony is something that is considered almost sacred, dedication, and discipline required to write one—let alone one of any merit—is unprecedented. A beginning composer first works on technical exercises and then writes short pieces with limited instrumentation. Over time, as their craftsmanship and personal voice develop, they begin composing more technically impressive and expansive works. Why is it not the same for writing? 

Why are writers encouraged to set themselves up for disappointment by beginning their journeys with a novel they will most likely not complete—or will most likely be of poor quality? Flash fiction, short stories, why are these not the tools of a developing writer?  Sure, you can artificially complete a large scale work by forcing yourself to write an absurd amount of words everyday. But if those words are riddled with redundant and idiotic prose, why bother? This is frustrating because these authors then feel the need to flood the market with their first effort, obscuring the visibility of accomplished writers using the same means. The ease of self publishing necessitates self control from the writers. 

A story no matter how original, it happens in composition quite often. I would also not be surprised if they never finished it at all. I have done some research and have found that many of my favorite authors began as journalist and short story writers. This did not surprise me at all. Why then isn't this the norm? 

In conclusion I feel that seeing an idea from its conception to its completion is very important for a young artist, please let me know.

What a difference 10 years can make!

I feel as though young me was trying to direct mannequins on a stage. My characters and plots were more copies of other things I had read than they were my personal creations. They were hollow, but instead is very real.

What has changed? It will sound cliche, and learned to laugh. And more importantly, (because I am a writer), I have learned why these emotions define your humanity.

In this time I have lived in four different states, moved, and made new friends--and then discovered the joy of contacting old friends again. People close to me have died. I have seen a new generation being born in nieces and nephews.

I have made good decisions

I have watched. I have observed. They sound like passive actions

Thus if you are young and frustrated because you want to be a writer

Do not be discouraged! I would argue you will learn more about humanity (and thus be better able to write about it

So don't stress if you cannot write. Go out and immerse yourself in humanity! Put yourself in new places, the better writer you'll become.

OK,000 people, and as a sideline to my freelance and self-publishing work I write grant applications for free for local nonprofits and government agencies.  In the five years I've been doing this I've helped these organizations get over $750,000 in funding, including $350,000 worth of personal protective gear for our local volunteer fire department through FEMA's ""Assistance to Firefighters Grant"" program, a $210, two Dodge Chargers for the Sheriff's office through our state highway department (not to militarize them

And then this afternoon my phone rang and it was my state's US senator's office calling to tell me that FEMA was going to award the fire department I work with another $198

I started writing a fantasy novel in 2009. The reasons aren't as important as the lessons learned along the way, in case they helped someone else who may be struggling at one or more of the same phases of their first work.


Here we go! 



They say you should write every day. I didn't. I couldn't; Two kids and full time job. So I did what I could: four hours every weekend. That's it. I finished two drafts this way

I sometimes spent my entire four hours mulling over the story

I went to the same Starbucks for every session, my brain was in writer mode before I got out of the car. The location itself doesn't matter, but consistency can be a huge help.

I listened to film scores while writing. Loudly. I imagine visually

I used a full-screen word processor (Bean

My novel started as a single flash

I had no outline when I began. I developed it as I went along. I bought a blank book and filled it with sketches

They say you need to be widely read or an avid reader in order to write. I am neither. I cannot finish most books

Here are some ""rules"" I came to adhere to:

1. Rule of Threes: Simply put, but for names, places, events, plot points, etc. Most early ideas suck. This goes well with rule #2. 

2. Murder Your Darlings: A famous rule. My novel greatly improved with the removal of certain characters

3. Garbage in/Garbage out: I am convinced now that the best ideas for every level of story come from the subconscious; this devilish, audio, whatever), and it would produce more good ideas at a higher rate, according to how much I fed it. For instance, I went to the theater three times on Thursday, and watched a movie in between at home, etc.

4. The three-hundredth time is the charm: Rewrite, but the reality is that some chapters are on their THIRTIETH. Some on only their second or third. Take as much time as it takes to get it right, and don't stress that it's not right yet, which leads to my next rule:

5. It's not done until it's done: Every time I would become discouraged with the story (which was about every other day)

Some other insights

- Power through the first draft

The hardest thing I had to learn to do was stop going back to edit as I went. Here's the thing though: it's more important to finish. If you finish your first draft, and no one else could have made sense of it. All because I refused to go back and change anything, so I would make a change to the story and keep on truckin'! But I finished.

- Exercise your creative hemisphere.

I found that I could blast writer's block by changing my approach to the story. For instance, I mentally treated him as a supporting character for a while, which freed me to create more overt and wild personality elements, which made him far more interesting. I did the same with supporting characters, treating them as if they were the protagonist. This allowed me to explore their motivations and perspectives.

When the plot dried up, in parallel. This often resulted in me realizing that character ""B"" was at a point where they would do ""X"", which moved everyone else along too. This also helped me to see some characters who needed to be taken out, or sometimes added.

- Stop attending workshops

These things, which all you should be focused on. Leave all that for the finish line.

Finally


                                  Don't. Stop.

Even if the novel never sells, and a love for the craft of writing. To look forward to the work, not the results.

And a bit of an example from the book that motivated this post. The book is The Wheelman from Duane Swierczynski. It has couple of Russian mafiosos in there, and those are all real names, but then plausibility shatters. There was not a single child named Evsey from 1960s. Likewise, no one names their child Mikal, in Russia we have Mikhail, which is derived from the same source, and while Dimitra is used as a devotional name in women monasteries

In April of 2012 I decided I would try to write a book in 3 months. I knew it was ambitious but I wanted to do it that way because I knew from experience that I lose interest in every project after a few months. In fact, and edit/format in the next month. It didn’t quite turn out that way, obviously, since it is June of 2013, but about 300 days after I said I would finish, I’m finally done. I actually took only about 3 months to do all of it, it just wasn’t in one continuous span. But

**The Plug**

The book is called [The Natural Victim](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00D1CPHF2). It is a classic mystery in the same vein as Agatha Christie and Margaret Allingham. It is set in the late 90s on the Ohio State Campus. You can read the blurb and get it from Amazon. It’s free till Friday (June 7th

[Change in length over time](http://i.imgur.com/8E0hWa8.png) - During my first draft

[Breakdown of time spent by draft](http://i.imgur.com/bnuDjZT.png) - The single largest chunk of time was spent on the first draft. But when compared to overall time spent


**Writing**

My goal was to write ~1000/day for 60 days. I hit the words/day goal pretty consistently as you can see from the figures, I went back to it. 

**Editing**

It took me six edits (two of them are consolidated in the pie chart) to get everything done and that’s not including the two edits from my editor. I could probably do with 5 next time and spread it out the following way - 

1st edit (second draft): General readthrough identifying any major loopholes and or problem areas. The editing consisted of moving large parts of the story around (like moving an entire chapter to the front of the book because I didn’t want to surprise the reader with crucial parts of the story late in the narrative). I also corrected anything easy that caught my eye like typos but I wasn’t looking for those.

2nd edit (third draft): Scene by scene. I focused on the scenes especially the dialogue keeping in mind the following - Does it sound natural or contrived? Does the dialogue fit the character? And does everyone in the scene get to say something (otherwise ask yourself if they need to be there?)

3rd edit (fourth draft): Line by line. Fix things big and small along the way. I think the hardest part was taking out flowery over-the-top sentences that made me sound like Marquez in my head. 

Editor interlude

4th edit (fifth draft): Taking my editor’s comments into account.

Another Editor interlude. This time with emphasis on the proofreading aspect. At this point you don’t want to start making major changes to your book unless you find something seriously wrong.

5th edit: Final proofread.

**Formatting for the Kindle**

Formatting is not overly complicated IF you find the right guide for your combination of tools. I wrote my document on a variety of editors - started with Word, I moved everything back to Word, and followed one of the tutorials online on how to get it together. It took a couple of days but it isn’t hard if you are computer savvy. The hardest part is finding the right set of instructions since there have been minor changes to the format over time.

**Marketing**

Author and Redditor /u/MichealJSullivan had an excellent post a while back on [Dos and Don'ts for getting reviews for your book](http://www.reddit.com/r/Write2Publish/comments/1aqkjq/dos_and_donts_or_getting_reviews_for_your_book/)

**Lessons Learned**

* Editing takes time. I can’t believe I thought I could get away with 1/3rd of the time for editing. 2/3rd is a better estimate. I know writers
* Writing and editing are the two biggest parts of the book but there are other things to do as well - Finding a cover or a designer, you only have to muck through this once or twice before you can settle on a good combination. But that first time around it can get frustrating when all you want to do is to get the damn book done!
* Fillers, I found I had repeated some variation of “After they said their goodbyes, the walked over to &lt;insert next location&gt;,” every single time. My best advice is to get a few good books in your genre and see how the authors do it.

That’s all folks. I hope this is useful to someone. I have been blogging about writing the book on my [website](http://writebywriting.wordpress.com) and I will be updating it with how it does in Amazon.

Over the weekend, and go to town on it.](http://i.imgur.com/d3QZ62f.png) 

I've probably accomplished more this one weekend than I have in the last month or two. It allows me to really *read* it like it's a book, make notes when I think something needs more exposition, cross out words, and so forth.

At first I was pretty skeptical about this. I figured, which does *basically* the same thing, right?

But I was completely wrong. This has been arguably the best thing I've done since I started writing. I can flip through pages, and see how it works. I've even written down ideas of how to move it along in places it stagnates, and how to pace it out better in areas that need more ""fleshing out.""

It's also been helpful for seeing words I would normally gloss over in a Word document. I see redundancies, using ""forces"" instead of ""forced."") I've also seen how often I'll repeat certain words and phrases (shrugged, nodded, sighed, etc).

Writing is a business like painting is a business. Sure, but you're missing the point if that's what you're after.

Writing is first and foremost an expression of creativity. Sure, but it's not going to happen if you listen to these assholes and sacrifice your voice. There are a lot of extremely successful writers out there who would get universally panned by the ""experts"" on this board. 

Here's your number one rules, whatever you want to call it:

Don't listen to anyone. Write what you want, your goal should be to write an amazing story that's every bit as good as you know you are. 

Remember that you started writing because you know you can spot good writing, but you have good taste and that's all you need. If you can spot good writing and then look at your own and say, ""well, I know what's good and this isn't it, what's wrong with me?"" The answer's that there's nothing wrong with you. It will come to you, just keep practicing, writing, or listening to these guys tell you that your voice or style are all wrong; it won't work. Write until you know what you're writing is good

**Edit**: I know that writing is a form of communication, so I realize how difficult language becomes when the professor goes out of their way to use inaccessible vocabulary - effectively defeating the purpose. To me writing is a process where you translate your imagination into language, language into words, and then a reader takes those words, converts them to language, and then translates them into their own imagination. It's a wondrous and daunting process, and it's an art.

So – here we go:
 
1.         Short Stories – Write a short story that gives people a taste of the world you created. (Might be fantasy based
2.     Specific Category – Make sure you choose 2 categories that are absolutely relevant. A good tip would be to act like a reader and see if you would stumble upon your own book by manually going to Amazon
3.        Comics – Create a one-page comic of your novel. This appeals to visual crowds and feeds like Tumblr
4.        Facebook Page – Pretty basic
5.        Newsletter – Emails accrued from your blog made into weekly newsletters.
6.        SF Signal and SmartGirlsScifi – Guest posts lead to tweets and RT’s.
7.        KDP Select – Prime members download for free
8.        Free Downloads – 24-hour period boosted ranking.
9.       YouTube Collabs – (With singers that have a relevant following. Not much of a point in collaborating with people whose audience would hate your book's genre).
10.       YouTube Videos – Pranks and commercials for fun and to give the world a sense of a more playful side. Also
11.       Twitter – #Constant updates and #hashtagging brought in #sales.
12.       Google Hangout – Invited early readers to talk about ideas for the sequel.
13.       Goodreads – Connected to my Twitter and gave me 1K followers in a day.
14.       Reddit – R/writing for advice and psychological support (haha).
15.       LinkedIn – Posted in relevant boards.
16.       Create a Game – Brought my book to life with a game called Red War (700+ registered).
17.       Wattpad – Not a noticeable return yet
18.       Sneak Peeks – Downloadable and free on Amazon/Smashwords.
19.       Book Cover – Didn’t come cheap but I made sure I liked it 500%.
20.       Advance Copies – Specifically to bloggers to spread the word.
21.       Friends &amp; Family Emails – Excited word-of-mouth was a huge boost.
 
 
* Would also love any additional ideas for spreading the word!

What is inspiration? No one seems to know. But they do know what inspiration does. Inspiration makes you jot down ideas on napkins. Inspiration wakes you up at 3am and forces your hands on the keyboard. Inspiration makes you crazy, somehow, into a writer.

The problem with inspiration is that it's a good story, dramatic, *sexy* about pounding out a novella fueled only by caffeine and determination through endless sleep-deprived nights. There's hardly anything interesting at all about constructing a novel slowly, over the course of weeks, months, even years, and having small

Inspiration is a story we want to come true, ultimately, fake.

For a while I've been wondering why Hemingway's quote, I finally made the connection: like anything else, ""writing drunk"" is appealing because it invites us to change our mental state into something different.

And changing our mental state is where

It's a myth that won't die, waiting for Inspiration to strike us at any moment, and eventually we have the realization that we're Doing It Wrong; inspiration doesn't lie in the mind of the sober! We must get drunk, get high, go 48 hours without sleeping, or some other quasi-religious ritual to get in touch with our inner creative self.

The reason for this, our Inner Writer, our Muse, our Creative Spirit, to be a writer, and for the rest of our conscious mind to reap the rewards.

And even if that were possible

The point is, or buzzed, or what have you.

What's worse about this is that inspiration isn't fake, and that can only happen if you are *already thinking*. And yes, you may think better during a certain time of day, or with certain music playing, or in a specific place, or whatever. But the point is that you aren't just sitting there waiting to be inspired during those times; you are already puzzling your way towards an idea when creativity happens.

The point is, and stop acting like there's some writerly part of you that needs unlocking first. Because while that may be a good story, I think actually managing to achieve your dreams, even if it's through things as humdrum as hard work and practice, is much more narratively satisfying.

1366859393.0,1d24do,Five Reasons I'll Keep Reading Your Story,RayAlanHarvey,298,62,139,"There are many reasons — many more than five — that I’ll keep reading your story.

But there are also at least as many reasons I won’t.

(For example: He had nothing in the way of a like God-concept, when he prayed, but he did it. — David Foster Wallace, *Infinite Jest*)

Here, are five reasons I will:

**1. You can sustain a long sentence**

I like long sentences that sing. I always have. It’s become cliche these days to talk about “simplicity in writing” and “clarity is king” and so forth — and it’s incontestably true that clarity is the principle thing: you must make yourself understood. But in delicate hands

“If it made any real sense — and it doesn’t even begin to — I think I might be inclined to dedicate this account, to the memory of my late, ribald stepfather, Robert Agadganian, Jr.” — J.D. Salinger, *De Daumier Smith’s Blue Period*

A writer who can sustain a long sentence is a writer who thinks clearly.

**2. You’ve given me something to fret over**

You’ve established a series of obstacles that in reason interest readers, in a way that keeps us hungry for more. The obstacles your characters encounter are not inconsequential or meaningless obstacles — i.e. your lead character’s biggest conflict is not what color she should paint her nails — but you’ve instead asked yourself: are my characters’ values important enough for readers to fret over?

**3. Your plot shows your inexhaustible imagination**

Plot — true plot — is difficult. It’s plausible but unpredictable. It presents a sequence of events that progresses logically and builds toward a climax. Note that: your plot should build. It can build slowly, as in Raiders of the Lost Ark. This means, among other things, that your plot culminates in a climax. Climax is the point at which your plot brings together all the major elements of your story and then explodes. Good plots are not action alone. They are an integration of action and ideas. Good plots do not just raise questions. They raise questions and answer them, which in turn raises more questions which are in turn answered, and so on. That is partially what I mean when I say that plot is “a sequence of events that progresses logically yet unpredictably.” Good plots, through a process of satisfying your curiosity and then piquing it more,” wrote Crawford Killian.

**4. Your story is about something**

This means you’ve woven meaning into your story. (This, like *Gone With the Wind,* or it can be abstract, like *Bladerunner.* It can be a basic love story with a road plot, like *Wild at Heart,* or a love story with a horror plot, like *House of Leaves.* It is, a story about something — a story that appeals to things real within the body of the human experience

**5. Your characters are believable AND remarkable**

Readers like reading about exceptional people. We’re fascinated by antagonists like Hannibal Lecter and Mr. Frost

Readers are equally or more fascinated by protagonists like Sherlock Holmes or Ellen Ripley

Yet it’s difficult to create believable characters like this.

Part of the trick is to develop a storyline (i.e. plot) that can showcase your characters’ virtues and vices. (It is in this sense that I refer to plot as a vehicle.)

Another part of the trick is to be able to show your characters’ motivation. In a real sense, for example, the human heart.",Discussion,False,,t5_2qh2n,disc,http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/1d24do/five_reasons_ill_keep_reading_your_story/

For those who don't want to click:

**32 Rules of Writing**

1: Avoid pleonasms. A pleonasm is a word or phrase which can be removed from a sentence without changing its meaning. For example, ‘that’ and ‘actually’ are three frequently-seen culprits (I actually just know that he’s the killer can be trimmed to I know he’s the killer), and phrases like ‘more or less’ and ‘in any shape or form’ are redundant.

2: Use oblique dialogue. Try to generate conflict at all times in your writing. Attempt the following experiment at home or work: spend the day refusing to answer your family and colleagues’ questions directly. Did you generate conflict? I bet you did. Apply that principle to your writing and your characters will respond likewise.

3: Use strong verbs in preference to adverbs. I won’t say avoid adverbs

4: Cut adjectives where possible. See rule 3 (for ‘verb’ read ‘noun’).

5: Pairs of adjectives are exponentially worse than single adjectives. The ‘big, I’m hoping he dies before he arrives at his destination. Mind you, that’s probably a cue for a ‘noisy, white’ ambulance to arrive. Wailingly, perhaps!

6: Keep speeches short. Any speech of more than three sentences should be broken up. Force your character to do something. Make him take note of his surroundings. Ground the reader. Create a sense of place.

7: If you find you’ve said the same thing more than once, “The first couple of images might not work, but the third one should do it. If not, maybe all three together will swing it.” The writer is repeating himself. Like this. This is a subtle form of pleonasm.

8: Show, let’s hope so. So cut it. If you want to engage your readers, don’t explain everything to them. Show them what’s happening and allow their intelligence to do the rest. And there’s a bonus to this approach. Because movies, of necessity, show rather than tell, this approach to your writing will help when it’s time to begin work on the screenplay adaptation of your novel!

9: Describe the environment in ways that are pertinent to the story. And try to make such descriptions active. Instead of describing a book lying on a table, right?

10: Don’t be cute. In the above example

11: Avoid sounding ‘writerly’. Better to dirty up your prose. When you sound like a writer

12: Fix your Point Of View (POV). Make it clear whose head you’re in as early as possible. And stay there for the duration of the scene. Unless you’re already a highly successful published novelist

13: Don’t confuse the reader. If you write something you think might be unclear

14: Use ‘said’ to carry dialogue. Sid Fleischman calls ‘said’

15: Whilst it’s good to assume your reader is intelligent

16: Start scenes late and leave them early.

17: When writing a novel

18: Give your characters clear goals. Always. Every scene. And provide obstacles to those goals. Always. Every scene. If the POV character in a scene does not have a goal

19: Don’t allow characters who are sexually attracted to one another the opportunity to get into bed unless at least one of them has a jealous partner.

20: Torture your protagonist. It’s not enough for him to be stuck up a tree. You must throw rocks at him while he figures out how to get down.

21: Use all five senses in your descriptions. Smell and touch are too often neglected.

22: Vary your sentence lengths. I tend to write short

23: Don’t allow your fictional characters to speak in sentences. Unless you want them to sound fictional.

24: Cut out filtering devices, ‘he observed’ are all filters. They distance the reader from the character.

25: Avoid unnecessary repetition of tense. For example: I’d gone to the hospital. They’d kept me waiting for hours. Eventually, I saw a doctor.

26: When you finish your book

27: Don’t plant information. How is Donald

28: If an opinion expressed through dialogue makes your POV character look like a jerk

29: Characters who smile and grin a lot come across as deranged fools. Sighing and shrugging are also actions to avoid. Eliminating smiles

30: Pronouns are big trouble for such little words. The most useful piece of information I ever encountered on the little blighters was this: pronouns refer to the nearest matching noun backwards. For example: John took the knife out of its sheath and stabbed Paul with it. Well

31: Spot the moment of maximum tension and hold it for as long as possible. Or as John D. MacDonald put it: “Freeze the action and shoot him later.”

32: If something works

It goes without saying that completing a novel is an accomplishment. Even if it is an unblessed turd with prose so jarring one can feel the mechanisms of a molecular revolt stirring in their brain, relieving feeling. But such debts are not paid easily.

One of the reasons I’m writing this is to simply express my experiences when it comes to finishing a book and trying to follow the craft as a profession. I read many biographical stories from authors, but I enjoy reading their opinions and journeys all the same. What I’ve noticed, though, is that a lot of those terse, go-get-‘em helpings never really told me much about the process itself.

For example, is very self-evident. Nobody takes writers seriously because of it. The written word is cheap and talking about it is even cheaper. As it turned out, I was not the only person in my then-workplace to be writing their own book. And I cringed like a tortured frog as these fellow word-sponges squeezed their delusional salts all over me. Oh my god, I thought as they told me about their Harry Potter-inspired tales, we’re all the same. Nobody told me extreme cynicism would seed itself from there and send its endless roots sprawling into the soil, a tiny farce of a tree bobbing above like some arboreal iceberg. I turned to cheesy dark, gothy thoughts like, all the earth is really known for are two large

So

Nobody told me about the stress of crossing the finishing line. Nobody said I’d begin to worry about the physical state of the manuscript itself. Back it up on USB, in turn, started hiding my laptop before going to bed and when leaving for work. I started to worry endlessly that someone would steal my work. I have no idea how writers of old dealt with this when they really did have actual, physical copies as their sole source. I was darkly humored when, a short while ago, I read about how Hemingway was fearful he would lose his manuscripts that were stored in a Cuban vault. Nobody ever told me a damn thing about fears like that. And as my book neared completion I also began to worry that I would die. Death sharpens itself on the dangers of passing moments. It is practically nonexistent when your life is great and stunningly gripping when that semi merges into your lane as you sip hot coffee. Every keystroke became a turn of the whetstone for that grim specter’s blade. I can’t die now, I thought, I would think as another airplane rumbled over my room. It just had to happen. Thankfully

But nobody told me about other stresses, rancid aroma that was so thick and sticky it armored their very skin. Likewise, I had stared at my own words so long they lost total meaning. I could no longer tell what in their world was good or bad. I stood over my novel like a trembling surgeon, unsure of where to cut or how. And do surgeons dream of screwing up? Because I started to dream of one-star reviews and universal panning of my awful novel. I started to dream of a dying dream. Failure is the natural order of things, after all. A person sucks at the start of everything. It is a suffocating reality. Everybody begins below the ice and has to claw their way out and, for me, it was getting difficult to ignore the chills.

Nobody told me the marketplace is a vicious monster with a sweet tooth. I have written under many pseudonyms, and there are so many unread on the market (seriously), I wince because cackling above their tombs are the trite gods of erotica and cheap pulp. And I shake my fist at those deities with their unedited ways, textureless filler, shameless self-plugging and the list of offenses goes on. But I submit to them all the same, prostrating myself before their sticky temple like a drunkard, slain by the bottle

Then I found /r/writing and I saw a post called ""this is what finishing a novel looks like"" and my first thought was ""oh yeah.. My novel.."" I didn't really put it aside for any time.

The very next day I wrote 726 words, and I got right back into the writing groove I grew up with. And here we are, a little less than four months later, with a completed novel at a tad under 90,000 words with an average word count of 749 words per day.

Before writing, third-person voice where the only descriptions are of the literal actions occurring, and the narrator follows one character very closely.  

By half-way through the second book, etc. that really give a character depth.  I decided to just keep going and finish the story.

The second lesson was that it's incredibly hard to world-build as you go along - while still making story arcs that are compelling and sensible.  A lot of characters pop-in from nowhere

I suppose I should start by saying that I would rather have my testicles nailed to a sinking ship than read one more page of this reeking drivel. Where to even begin? Understandably, poking at well established tropes for a laugh. However, in reality, we only see the lackluster adolescent mind of the writer slapped haphazardly across the pages. I found myself asking, why? What happened to this fellow that made him so keen to abuse his nascent readership? Was he bitten by a superhero enthusiast as a child, thereby instilling a burning need to alienate any such persons by writing farces such as this? The characters are so far beyond derivative as to insult derivatives by association. One-dimensionality and predictability abounds, and I found myself already knowing what would happen next, such was the grievous nature of the transgression. Would that I could undo the damage to my literary sensibilities by whipping myself raw with a barbed scourge or throwing myself upon a sword

tl;dr This book sucked the sweat off a dead man's balls.

**Self-publishing saved my life.**

Back in December 2011 I was in a bad place. I hadn't had a full-time job since 2008, couch surfing, and hadn't had even the promise of real work in months.

You know how they say that you should treat a job hunt like a job? Yeah

So I found myself with little more than a laptop

**I have always considered myself a writer**

Now, I was filling up spiral notebooks with stickman comic books and giving them to my grandparents. As soon as I learned to read I became a literary addict, binging on as many books as I could get my grubby little hands on. In class I'd ignore whatever the teachers were blathering on about and read something hidden under the lip of my desk. When assigned reading I'd get through it in the first day. I still binge; I think I got through the last Harry Potter book in a single sitting.

I don't read as much anymore. And by 2011, but truth was I hadn't written anything substantial in years.

Never tried to get published, read How To's on the business by Stephen King and Ray Bradbury and Orson Scott Card. Never did so much as send a query, though. Maybe it was a fear of success. Or a fear of failure. It seems an alien mindset to me, now, but all I know is that it was some d*mn unprofessional attitude or another that held me back, kept me working [crap] jobs to make other people rich.

If I was smart

**Might as well write somethin'**

So I found myself in late 2011 with a lot of free time, but it's a good thing; I was rapidly burning through my social circle's hospitality, and was faced with an upcoming Chicago winter.

I wrote a short psychological thriller about the end of the word and sent it off to some magazine. A milestone. My first ever submission anywhere.

It was rejected. I had expected that. What I hadn't expected was that my rejection was a personal one

Spirits lifted, right?

I spent some time researching it, and Barnes &amp; Noble. I hastened and wrote a few other stories, publishing four that first month.

I made $10. And I was doing everything wrong. 

My covers were terrible, but I had no clue about the business of writing.

**Gotta learn the trade**

I did some more research

That was $250 more than I'd earned in a long time.

As time went by, kept honing my skills with covers and blurbs and titles. I stopped wasting so much time on twitter and facebook trying to promote myself, and instead focused on producing content. I've got the website, but that's about all the active marketing I bother with, beyond sending out a twitter announcement and mailing list email when I publish something new.

By June 2012 I was making a thousand dollars a month.

That may not sound like a lot as someone's sole source of income, Amazon and BN and Kobo and iTunes get their cut, but I'm not working for anyone else. Nobody else is making as much offa my word-sweat as I am.

And that's incredibly liberating.

**Where I'm At**

So I've been plateaued at around a thousand a month since then and I can't seem to climb any higher for whatever reason, or I'll just have an inventory where the individual sales trickles add up to more.

I can write. My reviews tell me that. And I'm learning to publish.",,t5_2qh2n,1365361251.0,fluff,Author,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/1bv0nv/why_i_selfpublish/

***

Write 500 words a day, that’s all bollocks, write for two hours a day. Or four. Plan every chapter meticulously, but don’t plan anything at all because it’s got to be spontaneous. You must write in the morning, it’s the most creative time of the day, studies have proved it. Except for the evening, the magic only happens after midnight

Why can’t we just write? Why do we have all of this advice out here

That all this advice is contradictory does not mean it is not of use. More critically, debating one set of techniques over another, that we can lose sight of the problems they are trying to solve. And if you haven’t properly considered the problem, you can’t find the solution to fit it.

It’s important to return to first principles every once in a while; to remember just what it is that makes writing so difficult. Some of the bigger ones just in the drafting stage include:

*Fear of the blank page at the start of the day  
*Exhaustion
*Idea not fully realised
*Characters and world insufficiently developed  
*Lapsing into cliche  

You shouldn’t be writing in a particular way because Hemingway tells you to. Writing methods are not rituals to be followed in the hope that the Gods will be favourable to you. They are practical solutions to difficult problems

It’s useful to see how others have approached these problems, one might even be marginally better than the other depending on circumstance, but the important thing is to get on with it before the whole house burns down.

Identify problems

I was thinking it might be helpful (to the community and myself) to expand this into a focused conversation on 'what to do next'. I do not claim to be an expert

I'm in the process of creating a very large to do list

Tell us about what's on your to do list! I will keep a record of what we come up with on my [blog.](http://mogonzo.blogspot.com) 

I've broken mine down into categories to start: 

Publishing industry research &amp; work

1. Write draft query letter
2. Write draft back book cover
3. Write draft “what qualifies me to write this book” 
4. Write draft “why will this book sell &amp; what does this book compete with”
5. Find the names of 10 large agencies seeking submissions in my genre
6. Research each of the agencies 
7. Find the contact information for 3 major publishers and 3 minor publishers 
8. Research each of the publishers
9. Create list of all possible networking contacts in publishing field 
10. Write 5-10 page synopsis of book. 

Promotional work

1. Create Social media accounts, Instagram, Reddit, Tumblr
2. Create a blog on a topic of which you can speak well
3. Build social networking contacts  


Self publishing research 

1. Research kickstarter
2. Research indiegogo
3. Research costs of self publishing
4. Research self publishing on amazon
5. Research &amp; price possible graphic designers
6. Research &amp; price possible editors 

Actual Manuscript work

1. Print off paper copy for initial editing
2. Mark where foreshadowing is required or can be placed
3. Mark where more description is required
4. Re-create character diagrams based on what the characters do and say in what you have written

Time Breakdown (in minimums) 

* 2 hours each day on editing
* 1 hour each day creating content for social networking accounts + networking
* 30 mins each day writing blog pieces
* 30 mins each day researching agents &amp; publishing houses
* 30 mins each day working on other to do list items 

** /u/craftyodyseus has made an excellent point about how much time is being spent on promotional work vs. actual editing. I'm updating the time requirements from this insight.  
** /u/Stevehops has also pointed out that many agencies are looking for a 5-10 page synopsis of your book these days

1354998287.0,14iftb,3 sketch comedy tips that all writers could use,brandonchicago,208,39,16,"The single best thing I’ve done to improve my writing was learning how to write sketch comedy.

Sketch comedy is the guerilla warfare version of storytelling. In sketch, transition, climax, and end – on a stage and in under 5 minutes. Ready? Go!

Given such insane constraints


**1. Get to the point**

The first thing that your sketch needs to do is establish the who

This is an excerpt from my sketch “[3 Strikes You’re Out](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=PL79dksDNe4)“.

*Steve*
Whoo! Way to to Thome! Ya! Send those Northside pricks packin! Buck up kiddo

*Brett*
(Unenthusiastically)
Oh

*Steve*
Yeah! That a kid! Hey, can you believe these guys still play in that shitty stadium of theirs? That place don’t even got a jumbo-tron.

*Brett*
Dad


Who: A White Sox fanatic of a father &amp; his apathetic son.

What: The son is not enjoying the game despite the father wanting him to. At the end

Where: A baseball game (Thome is a White Sox player

**2. This is the day**

The sketch has to tell a story that is significant in the lives of its characters. The late Mary Scruggs would always tell us

**3. Character wants and subtext**

Characters can, we can get behind them and hope for their success, or hope that they fail. It gets the audience involved. If we don’t know what the characters want, the scenes will become stiff and lose the audience.

Knowing what your characters want also drives subtext to their actions. Dave may really want to eat the cookie that Jane has in her hand. To get it, a relationship, and we want to know what happens next.

**3.5. (Bonus) The knockout**

A sketch or a story will really stick with you if it has a good button or knockout ending. What can happen at the end of the story that catches your audience by surprise? In sketch

None of this excuses the fact that /r/writing needed moderation that I wasn't around for. 

So, he pointed me to the thread complaining about wanting to mod /r/writing, so in the short time I had, I took the following actions:

* Added violentacrez so he could help out with moderation duties
* Added karlgraves so he could help steer the community; he seemed like he had some good ideas

So imagine my shock when apparently this isn't enough, is experience moderating several large subreddits, including /r/funny, which, to my knowledge, has not degenerated into a lawless hellhole full of horrible people. /r/WTF, /r/Art, and /r/entertainment are also his. So he was added to take care of spam and other user requests because I have been temporarily swamped. I don't see how his name is somehow synonymous with rape. However

So that's all that happened. violentacrez never banned anyone from /r/writing. The ban list is completely empty. He was not here to change the subreddit. He is not here as a ""fuck you

What also happened was a fucking witch hunt. I love reddit, the people responsible need to be run out of town and/or located personally and beaten to death. Think about this: yeah, maybe you don't like VA; maybe you don't like seeing his name on the sidebar. That's fair. But what negative impact did it *really* have on the community? Tons and tons of posts about violentacrez. Thread after thread arguing about whether violentacrez is a rapist or just a pedophile. Lots of wasted space in /r/writing not spent talking about **actually writing!** These kind of completely insane witch hunts do nobody any good.

Not to mention that just about *no one* noticed that I added karlgraves. Or some kind of conspiracy-level rant about how the placement of VA over karl is somehow significant. (Hint: It wasn't.)

**TL; DR: VIOLENTACREZ WAS JUST HERE TO HELP WITH SPAM; HE'S BEEN REMOVED AT THE COMMUNITY'S REQUEST.**

Now

I love books (I mod /r/books) and I love writing. I'm very passionate about both

But like any subreddit these days

A mod is someone that deals with the day-to-day trivialities of a subreddit: fishing spam out of the spam filter. Removing blogspam or offtopic posts. Helping other subcommunities (see sidebar ---&gt;) be seen. Helping people do things like writing contests or promote third party sites that mesh with /r/writing.

What a mod is *not* is the best writer. A mod is not the person with the most knowledge about writing. A mod is not the person who has the most works published. A moderator is someone that helps a reddit community; and this is an entirely different beast than writing itself. No one expects the moderators at /r/funny to be the funniest people or to have submitted the funniest submissions or comments. Making throwaway_writer a mod doesn't help improve the subreddit because they're successful
 
So let's choose some people to help moderate. I can see that a lot of people say they want more out of this community than just a plain old mod

Let's see some concrete proposals out there. Upvote on what proposals for improvement you think are best

Addendum on mod actions: I haven't permanently de-modded karlgraves, throwaway_writer, I'd be glad to consider, but despite not even having messaged me or #writing in the last couple weeks, he threw a fit about VA being made mod over him.~~ edit: Apparently this post of t_w's was a joke and I missed it.

Anyway, to see if there was any interest in a collection of flash fiction. I chose the 50 or so best stories out of 100. My best friend did the cover and some inset art, and formatted the manuscript for me. I did my best to edit as much as I could, re-arranged the stories, and completely destroyed all of the formatting (I'm sorry!). It was sent off, and I waited for 3 weeks. One week ago, five hardcover copies of my book arrived in the mail from lulu.com

I know it's relatively easy to self-publish nowadays, and the reactions are amazing. I even ended up giving my first book reading to a group of strangers at a bar a couple of days ago, and that was crazy! 

I have no idea whether I can or will make a career out of being a writer, the discipline, that gets people interested. I admit drawing inspiration from things like NaNoWriMo. I initially wanted to last 365 days, but quickly decided that was fairly unreasonable, at least at this stage in my 'career'.

Now, though:

**""I Don't Think The Moon Is Real""**

It contains 54 flash fiction stories of all shapes and sizes. The largest is about 6000 words, science fiction, fantasy, drama, action, horror, just about every genre under the sun. All different styles too! I was really trying to flex my writing muscles

At the end of the day, I'll call it a success if there is a single story that makes them want to remember it, and tell their friends, a story that makes them feel.

This is getting long

Here's the link: [I Don't Think The Moon Is Real](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B008QUHH84/ref=cm_sw_su_dp)

If you do want to download it and read and stuff, and if you really want to spend money on it, the hardcover is available from lulu.com for about $25, depending on your local currency. [Link here!](http://www.lulu.com/shop/gary-paul/i-dont-think-the-moon-is-real/hardcover/product-20233074.html)

1339595963.0,uzt6g,Bad writing is still writing,nisim777,188,31,101,"Most writers, but as I experience my own journey from wannabe to writer

Am I saying that it’s okay to write poorly? Not necessarily. As we grow as writers our skills will grow. If your skills aren’t growing…if you’re always producing bad writing…then something is amiss. I’ve know wannabe writers who have atrocious grammar and are doing nothing to remedy that. Here’s the funny thing though – if they keep pushing out material, it may even be a good book.

But that’s not the type of writer you should emulate. Emulate the writers who have gotten better over the years

Remember the way you were taught to sketch in grade school art classes? First you build a geometrical framework, though I dare say a few have made careers out of it. A first draft is like that framework (so is an outline before the draft).

If your first draft hits your major plot points (if you’re a plotter), and moves the story from point “A” to point “Z” (or point “A” to point “Gizquark” if your a surreliast author), then its done is job.

Don’t spend your time agonizing over sentence structure, and the like during a first draft. At the same time, don’t purposefully write poor first drafts out of laziness. If you have it in you to write a decent first draft without hindering your flow of getting the story on the page, then do it, but if you find yourself after a gut-wrenching hour with only three perfectly crafted sentences on the page, then step back and allow yourself to just write poorly.

Trust me

TL;DR - Sometimes you have to suck it up and write a piss-poor first draft in order to get the story out. You can always go back and make it perfect later.

What seems almost indisputable is that you must maintain forward momentum. Endless tinkering, an abandoned manuscript. But chucking down whatever comes into your head for thousands of words at a time can be equally problematic. 

Each to their own, that those of you who write a few hundred or even a few dozen each day might feel like you're doing something wrong. 

So I'd like to sing the praises of slowness, or even less. 

**Slowness is sustainable**   

Even on tough days, pressed for time, you should be able to find a few hundred words. The same is not true for a few thousand. Slowness lets you meet your targets 7 days a week without exhausting yourself. 

**Slowness gives you time to think

If you did 3000 words a day, let it steep inside your head, to get to the deeper places that give sustenance to good writing. 

This touches again on the idea of a 'good' 1000 words vs a 'bad' 3000 words.  For me, the right idea in the right place in the book; in need of polishing, but fundamentally well placed, the beginnings of something really good. 'Bad' first draft writing either needs to be cut or almost entirely rewritten. It's a bit better than not having written anything at all, but not by much.

You don't necessarily get to a good idea by writing the first thing that comes to mind and moving straight on. Often, you may just be skimming along the surface of your thoughts, never achieving depth. 

**Slowness means that you approach problems...well

You that fluttery feeling of terror when you're coming up to a scene, a scene that I have no idea how to write on Monday goes miraculously smoothly on Friday. Because I've been thinking about it all week, because I haven't smashed into it at 3000 words a day, I've had time to solve the problems before I get there.  

**Slowness is not that slow** 

500 words a day doesn't sound like much. But that's 3500 words a week. That's 14000 words a month. That's two mid sized novels a year. Not bad for just 500 words a day

**Source

FWIW I'm a soon to be published first time author (trad publishing) and an occasional teacher on a university writing program. This either makes me someone who might know what he's talking about

All this is just, dude? All writers vary in their practice (see comments below). This is what works for me. It might work for you. 

**TL:DR Forward momentum is critical. Speed not necessarily so. Remember Hemingway: “Never mistake motion for action.”**

Some things I've noticed:  

1.) The more I write

2.) It's okay if it's crap. Hanging around on this subreddit has taught me that my writing doesn't have to be top-notch the first time around.  All that I'm doing on the first pass is uncovering the story. Right now, and my dialogue is lacking in any originality whatsoever, but THAT'S OKAY. It's ALLOWED to be bad (the first time through). Just knowing that took a lot of the pressure off and, because of that, made writing so much less stressful for me. All that I'm responsible for right now is making sure that the skeleton is there so that after the first draft is done, it can support everything else that I will need to add on.  

3.) Just because I have a plan for how I want things to turn out, because forcing a specific plot on my story is like trying to change the course of a river. Yeah it works, but I might lose a lot of the inherent beauty as I try to make it work.  

4.) I try not to have too many expectations. That isn't to say I don't sometimes have confidence in my writing -confidence (and a touch of arrogance) can certainly be beneficial, this writing is probably going to be more of a practice novel rather than something worth publishing. Keeping my expectations realistic, and myself grounded in reality has actually pushed my creativity and productivity. Note: Results may vary.

5.) Damn it, and sometimes I feel like I would rather read Twilight cover to cover than write another page in my own book. When I really sit back and think about it though, I realize that I am literally creating something out of nothing. Without those 30,000 words I'm putting down, without the thousands more that need to come, my characters, my *world* would not exist. And in that same vein, then by God, but with that

All in all, but it's a start. Frequenting this subreddit has helped me chug along, and I hope that I can continue to do that. 30,000 words is a small victory for me, but it's still a victory and I wanted to share it. Thank you for all your insights, inspirational quotes, and suggested readings

The period immediately preceding the release was taken up with liasing with my publicist about the upcoming events and the two week book tour that they were sending me on. Local events were my responsibility, sending out invitations, getting the vibe happening on Twitter and my Facebook author page.

Because I live in a rural area I was able to launch in several nearby towns and cities. Each was well attended

I embarked on a journey by plane and hire car that took me across three states, Rotten Gods, is immoral, and that she would not buy it for that reason. I have been complimented, flattered, and ignored. I have learned to hand sell by engaging with a reader in a store and talking to them about those universal topics—books and reading.

The most marvellous experience of all was being told by readers, that I was able to photograph and paste on my Facebook page.  Others wrote reviews in newspapers and online. Others made phone calls, emails and social media posts. To have engaged with another human being, one on one, is the most special thing of all.

**1.** Don’t worry about publishers

**2.** Publishers prefer a first novel to be somewhere between 80, better shoot for around 100k, anything less will be too short.

**3.** No one likes purple prose. Do your best to describe the surroundings through dialogue.

**4.** Don’t write so much dialogue

**5.** When writing dialogue limit yourself to ‘he said’ and ‘she said’

**6.** Expand on the text between lines of dialogue to give your characters life

**7.** Limiting use of the word ‘was’ will make your story flow better.

**8.** You’re using phrases like ‘he/she’, etc. too often. It makes it seem like the reader is viewing instead of participating, replace them with ‘the’ and ‘was’.

**9.** If you find a plot hole stuff it full of spray cheese.

**10.** Plot holes can help you develop ideas for sequels

**11.** If you happen to attempt a protagonist of the opposite sex just write a strong hermaphrodite

**12.** Don’t start passages with the weather...

**13.** ...unless you can do it well.

**14.** The most important thing in writing is to be prolific

**15.** If you get writer’s block just keep writing

**16.** If you’re serious don’t write by hand

**17.** Don’t self-publish

**18.** You’re going to get rejected

**19.** Your first draft is going to read worse than *Fifty Shades of Grey*, you probably won’t get published anyway.

**20.** Don’t get discouraged!

I'd like to continue the discussion about well-intended but dangerous rules for writers.

Here's the original post and a few comments from the original thread to get you started (don't worry OP

------------------------------------

I've learned a lot in school for journalism about writing in general

1. Never write a sentence with more than 30 words. ( according to a little birdie, count them if you have to. Try and not worry about this during writing and clean it up during editing.
 
2. When finished writing anything underline all of the verbs. Next analyze each verb
 
3. Use adjectives sparingly
 
4. I'm going to say it anyway; active writing is very important. If you don't know what that is I suggest you google that shit.
 
5. Don't think of grammar as a strict set of rules
 
6. When you're finished writing anything
 
7. Know all of the parts of whatever the hell it is that you're writing. Break it down into small pieces.

8. And if you didn't already know this shit now you do. And remember kids: write drunk

------------------------------------

So guys

So, and [create a solid body of work on the Kindle store](http://www.amazon.com/Christopher-Ruz-Hayes-Kossmann/e/B005IHVH20/) - the difference being, I wouldn't stay anonymous. This way, if things work, I can show people why, and if they don't work, you can all see where I went wrong.

Throwaway's main advice to me was:
1) Sell short stories for 99c, so people know what they're getting. I did that, which gave me ten solid short stories and three collections ([Past the Borders](http://www.amazon.com/Past-the-Borders-ebook/dp/B004S2LGGS/) for scifi, [The King &amp; Other Stories](http://www.amazon.com/King-Other-Stories-ebook/dp/B005HW4CNM/) for contemporary fic, and [Nothing Too Dangerous](http://www.amazon.com/Nothing-Too-Dangerous-ebook/dp/B0067LH036/) for weird fic/horror).

2) Design covers that are crisp, but I think I hacked together [the best stuff I could](http://www.amazon.com/Poirot-and-the-Doctor-ebook/dp/B00681DKMK/) using just CC licensed photography, my friends, and photoshop.

3) Inside each book/story, keeping them visible. I did that, choosing [They Trade in Eyes](http://www.amazon.com/They-Trade-In-Eyes-ebook/dp/B0067SN36M/ref=ntt_at_ep_dpt_4) and [The King](http://www.amazon.com/The-King-ebook/dp/B0067RJM4A/ref=ntt_at_ep_dpt_1) as my leaders. So far, it doesn't seem to have worked, but I'll see where it goes in time.

People already seem to be responding pretty well to the change - for example, despite me not having listed it in Anthologies... (I must have fucked up somewhere). All my best stories are up now, and I'm working on two more in the hope of being able to publish one new short story a fortnight.

Basically, whether things get better, get worse, or just sink in to mediocrity, I'll keep r/writing updated. I'm the guinea pig. If one style of cover works better than another, I'll tell you. If a certain set of keywords improves or damages sales, I'll tell you. In the mean time, tell me and I'll change it. A bad or boring blurb? Tell me

*Writing a novel is like working on foreign policy. There are problems to be solved. It’s not all inspirational.* James M. Cain

This is a dangerous thing to say. Perhaps my hubris will come back to haunt me. But I don’t believe in writer’s block.

Or, and I am a writer of reasonably straightforward narrative prose. 

But I think it is mostly used by aspiring writers who don’t actually want to write. It’s a good excuse to throw oneself onto a sofa

When you are starting out, time consuming, and often boring. It takes years to get any good, years more to write anything worth publishing. The temptation to get out of this hard work by attending spoken word events, writers groups, literary festivals and above all by convincing yourself that you are blocked is very strong.

There are things which can stop a writer writing, exhaustion, and catastrophe.

**Fear**

This is the most problematic, of writing something unpardonably, embarrassingly bad. In truth, this never entirely goes away, but the seasoned writer develops strategies to deal with it.

Write every day and set up habits, give yourself permission to write badly. The paralysis of fear weakens when one discovers how much work is done in editing and redrafting, how much of the first draft is revised and discarded.

When you begin, no matter how bad it is and no matter how slight your progress. Every day that you don’t write, you grow weaker. That is what you should fear. Be afraid of not writing. Never be afraid of writing.

**Exhaustion**

To write, physical, and nervous energy to make use of this time and space. If any of these things are lacking, writing can be difficult, or even impossible.

But the problem is not on the page. What needs to be done is to restructure the life so that more resource can be directed towards the writing. Sometimes these changes are minor. Get up an hour earlier. Drink less. Eat better. Get some exercise. Sometimes they are moderate to major. Go part time at work, take a sledgehammer to your wireless router or TV.

Sometimes you can make the changes in a week, then you can get to solving them on the page.

**Catastrophe**

Very rarely, or romantic sense. This falls under exhaustion, for personal difficulties, severe illness or relationship disasters are powerful sappers of time and energy that will put you out of the game for a while. By catastrophe, I mean a catastrophe on the page.

This can’t be a garden variety difficult chapter, hopelessly clumsy sentences that you can’t seem to fix. These can all be written around or edited later on. We’re talking about a serious stylistic, structural, or thematic problem that simply cannot be written through. You’re several tens of thousands of words in, and think that you’ve made a fundamental error in the planning and execution of the book.

You’re allowed to take a few weeks off in this case, replanning and rewriting of a few chapters will give you something that intensive redrafting may salvage. But the process is the same. Act, work, and keep at it. Don’t stare at the blank page and wish that you were dead. Do something.

When you’re writing a novel, six figure advances and lifetime legacies. Just putting together a novel requires a lot of work, and not all of it will be very inspiring. There will be 70,000 words or more in your book. Surely you can find a few dozen or a few hundred of them today, in temporary, wobbly first draft form?

Surely there is something that can be done?

I've been the sole producer / publisher / editor of a literary magazine for about a year now. I've accepted about 40 pieces out of the 300-odd submissions

I do my best to write at least a few paragraphs for every rejection -- my longest rejection letter clocked in at close to 1, beautiful nuggets, and fatal flaws.

I end up writing some pretty similar things

There are a lot of submissions that are otherwise great, that they did not write their concept well enough to impact the reader in whatever way they intended, and so they essentially tell the reader what to feel. This might take the form of a paragraph-long description of a Carveresque quiet interpersonal calamity, written so well that I feel like I might start pouring sweat, which is topped off / ruined with a line like, ""their relationship was never quite the same after."" 

I KNOW that ""show, or showing and THEN telling, which is more frustrating -- it's like seeing a beautiful bird in a cage instead of getting to feel like you are that bird.

I decided to stop listening to the naysayers and embark on a career in the literary field. I sent out a mass of resumes over the holidays to various companies but most never replied. Most of my past experience is in menial warehouse work and customer service.

I finally got a reply from a transcription and self-publishing company and an interview scheduled for January 17th. I was so nervous that I was fighting off nausea the whole time. The tension was mounted in my neck and caused muscle spasms the whole time. They asked me many questions I had no idea how to answer

The next day I received and email. My heart sank as I read the first paragraph stating that they could not offer me the position for which I had applied. Then I read the next few lines and my jaw dropped. The email stated that my interviewer was so impressed with me that they were offering me a part-time temp to hire position to see if I could develop the required skills in order to earn the full-time position.

I was so shocked and ecstatic that I had to wait until the following day until I could gather my thoughts to form a reply. Of course I accepted and was informed that they are even foregoing the usual second interview.

It's a small step but it's finally a step on a path I actually want to be on.

1323786074.0,nazvk,Self-publishing and why hating it is counterproductive,NoSleepLurker,169,35,126,"Self-publishing is the future. Traditional publishers are going to morph into pure marketing firms and play a smaller role as their percentage of the royalties drops. Fairly soon

And why should any author

There were quite a few people in that other thread judging all self-published work as crap

""Sifting through the crap to find gems"" is not your problem. It is Amazon's problem,000,000th book that sits at the bottom of the lists, because it's terrible. It won't affect a single thing.

You know what the problem really is among authors who espouse negativity instead of trying to boost the community along?

Our metrics don't matter.

* Word count doesn't matter anymore. It's a relic of traditional publishing. Readers don't care how long a story is as long as the meat is all there and the ideas are complete - in fact

* Writing skill doesn't matter nearly as much as writers want it to. The keys are effective communication and entertainment (varying by genre of course). Readers in general don't really care if a work lacks good diction and good prose (re: Twilight) and they don't even care about overusing adverbs (re: Harry Potter). The dreck you hate at the top of the lists is there because readers know exactly what they're buying - and the dreck delivered it.

* People need more material now. They want a dozen good books by their chosen author

* The age of ideas is back in a whole new way. The world is more open, and humans are adjusting to a new way of absorbing books and the ideas therein. Internet-using readers are looking for a larger space of ideas than traditional publishing can provide. Those same 'gatekeepers' that 'judge' works to save us all from 'dreck' also eliminate most radical ideas. Authors are free to be as creative as they want with self-publishing.

* Life is moving faster. A relevant book needs to be published *now*

And if you can't see the benefits of these things

Let me put it to you this way: are you trying to make a living writing? What does a living constitute? $5k a month -&gt; $60k a year? Any self-published author worth a damn can make $5k a month and live his dream. Going full-time with self-pub will allow them to produce more, we're going to have more and better authors than ever before. Every single category, no matter how obscure, will have fantastic authors dedicated just to that genre.

Be one of those people. Don't pray for some ridiculous fat cat in a top hat and monocle to 'approve' your life's work. *Get it out there now* and cut out the negativity and complaining. Self-publishing is an opportunity - TAKE IT!

The only time I missed this target was on December 21st last year when I left the writing for late in the day

Of course, but there's also been lots of crap mixed in there. I've also been focused on first drafts, so I haven't gone back and completed something, which could end up being the major snag. (I have recently started rewriting something though, and it's going fine so far, but it's still early days.)

The reason for this post is to ""defend"" this approach I'm taking. I know ""write a lot"" and ""don't worry too much about a perfect first draft"" are common suggestions

Maybe those things are true. I'd just like to offer some of the benefits of getting the word count done no matter what

And so

1. **Inspiration kicks in at strange times**. I've taken hours to write 1200 words

2. **You can only ever write in the present moment**. If I don't write today, it'll just become another ""today"". Writing in the present moment is the only thing I really have control over.

3. **No matter what, but not enough to avoid tearing it to shreds. You'll just be tearing something a little nicer to shreds.

4. **A finished draft is easier to mould**. I haven't even begun to revise most of my stuff

5. **Your bad habits become obvious**. I write protagonists that are too passive, and since I experience these in volume, every day, I can see (most of) them.

6. **There's nothing else I can do**. I'm not a professional writer, ""What other choice do I have?"" I can either write, or not write. But if I don't write, then I'm not a writer. I think a lot of resistance stems from assuming there's an option.

7. **It's a fulfilling, but each time Scrivener ticks over to the 1500 word mark of my daily target, a warmth spreads through my body, and I am victorious.

http://blogs.vancouversun.com/2013/07/30/how-to-break-into-the-game-industry-part-3-on-writing-for-games-and-the-impossible-ish-dream/

Edit: Apparently I'm an idiot and did that wrong. Above is a link to my blog post. 

Edit 2: Here's an except (With a nod to Zero Punctuation). 

This is an ongoing blog about game culture, the industry, and blogging about it!  Last Week was the second in a three part series with hints and tips on how to break into the Video Game Industry. 

This week’s blog is the third in a three part series detailing tips and tricks on how to break into the Video Game Industry. Today we’re going to focus on writing and, as well as what is needed to work on your own projects.

So you want to write video games.

Part of me wants to just say “Don’t” and go for lunch early, realistically, there are only two ways to do it.

1. Be a published author or have had a script produced for some form of entertainment media (Web series, etc) and pitch yourself based on that.

2. Create your own projects. and use that as a way of gaining experience.

Most posted game writing jobs require at least two-three years minimum of experience working in the game industry as a writer. It’s a pretty massive Catch-22

Here's the ideals guiding our group:

1. We believe that we're stronger together.

2. We will help each other achieve our goals.

3. We believe that when one person succeeds the whole group is helped. 

4. We believe reddit writers deserve to make enough through self-publishing to afford a car wash now and then.

Based on these ideals we're going to try and begin a sort of ""imprint"" for self published, and benefit from increased downloads by members of the group. 

If willing to participate

The benefit there is that, you expect higher rankings to kick-start your sales. With new books getting higher rankings (and which include a blurb about your own book) you also expect *your own* sales to increase.

Make sense? 

We haven't worked it all out yet, (from design to logistics to layout to editing or just providing positive input, or maybe taking a leadership role as we organize) please comment below and I'll add you.

Thanks for reading. Really.

**edit**: this is the same publishing effort that druidcitychef mentioned in [his post](http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/p45f5/wolfpack_pub_a_new_sub_dedicated_to_helping_you/)- we just wanted to try and reach as many people as possible and had expected at least one of our posts to flop rather than have the top 2 posts for this morning. Sign up on either space

**EDIT 2:** Response has been overwhelming and I'm glad that so many share our enthusiasm for this effort!  We've been overwhelmed with response so we're going to close the flood gates for now.  **Please continue to indicate your interest and expertise below** and we'll add you - just maybe not right away!

- It's easier and faster to publish eBooks directly with Nook and the iBookstore than with Lulu. It would take about a week before the party game book appeared on each store when I used Lulu. Directly with the stores it was less than 24 hours.
- The iBookstore store is the only place you need an ISBN for an eBook. 
- On third-parties, but I will receive more. (Lulu takes a cut.) 
- The cheapest site I've found for an ISBN is $9 through ePubBud. The only catch is ePubBud is listend as the publisher with the broker, Uncovering Oklahoma is listed as the publisher. 
- You don't get any payments if someone buys your book directly from Lulu if you set it for 0.99. However
- Other than the iBookstore
- The eBook version of The Movie Murder Mystery Party has sold more copies than the paperback version
- Publishing books with a bleed on CreateSpace is a pain. I ended up just reformatting my date idea book without any image bleeds. I'm happy with the print quality of all of my books with them. 
- Knowing the right person really does help. I am friends with a girl who works the front desk of a news station. I gave her a copy of my date idea book this afternoon about about an hour later

But what constitutes a setting? Most people answer with ‘the time and place a story takes place in’. So one answer could be Victorian Paris. Another could be in an arm of a distant galaxy. But the place isn’t the only thing that creates the setting. The general populace creates it too

Which is the problem

What is your central conflict?

Ask yourself that every time you start a scene. The central conflict IS the hatred between the insectoid Klicklaks and the hated avian Flutters? Then how does that play out? If your piece sounds like a history lesson given by Ben Stein, and for that action to mean something, it must be opposed (Newton’s laws are even applicable to writing! Who knew!). Who is the opposing force? Ideas are not opposing forces! Ideas create the opposing forces, getting into the minds and guiding the actions of the antagonists. Your character may hate the concept of wanton abuse of natural resources, but without someone to struggle against, what makes him any different than a blogger sitting on a recliner sipping tea while they type out a scathing rebuke on their iPad? And that rebuke is nothing more than setting- creating the environment in which the conflict exists (Here is the situation, and here is the counter argument against it). It’s this small difference that causes confusion

Be aware of your characters, it’s story. If it’s the reason behind the situation that prompts the action, it’s setting. Keep your work focused on story. While actions require setting to have meaning, setting itself is not the story.

Depending on the size of the magazine

The truth is

* **The query letter.**

* **The first page of the submission.**

With that in mind

* **Proofread.** For the love of gods old and new

* **Be humble.** You have not written the next *Grapes of Wrath.* Yours is only one of the dozens or hundreds of submissions a first reader will see in any given day. Saying anything to the effect of, it is the best thing since *War and Peace* and together we will win a Pushcart with it and you would be a moron not to publish it” is going to get your query letter passed around the editorial office and laughed at. True story.

* **Revise.** Once you have finished a story, you can be sure they will not read past the first page. 

* **Read the magazine you’re submitting to.** Get a subscription if you can. Most lit mag subscriptions are laughably cheap. Not only will you be helping to support and uphold the industry you are trying to get money and recognition out of

* **Don’t try to be cute.** It’s okay to be charming and show a little wit in your query letter

* **Don’t try to be edgy.** Same premise as the previous point

* **Make the first page of your story the strongest in a narrative sense.** If there is anything boring in the first page of your story, the first reader is going to assume the rest of the story is boring too, and move on to the next thing in the slush pile. 

* **Read the submission guidelines.** If the submission guidelines say that they want the manuscript in Arial, by-gods if you want to publish in that magazine you will do exactly what they say. Because here’s a secret: sometimes ridiculous submissions guidelines are a test. They are a test to see how well you pay attention, or whether you’re someone who thinks that the rules don’t apply to you (the latter is a group of people that editors hate to work with). They are a test to see how bad you want it and how professional you’re capable of being. Flaming hoops of formatting guidelines is part of that process. If you want to be published, you will follow every single instruction that is given to you. 

* **Impressions are important.** If you make a good impression or get published in a magazine, you make an ass of yourself by not following any of the rules above, the first readers will remember you, and not in a loving way. Don’t let that happen to you.  

* **Don’t send simultaneous submissions.** Granted, do not submit to multiple magazines at the same time. Simple as that. Wait for a rejection letter before sending your work out to someone else. Nothing makes an editor shake their fist at the heavens more than to go through the cut rounds, pick a story they really like, only to see that that story has already been accepted elsewhere. It’s bad form. Don’t do it.

* **Consider the person on the other side of your submission.** They are usually unpaid, hungry, thirsty, and in dire need of a stiff drink. They are in the literary business because they love good writing, the same as you do. They are not the blackhat gatekeepers who are sabotaging your efforts at traditional publication. They are just doing their jobs, which is to make sure that they get the very best stories for the publication they’re working at. They have pride in their work, and they want you to have pride in yours too.

-These are not my own views

**--[Things to Avoid:]--**

* Creating Elongated or Unrecognizable Fantasy Names (ex: *Riddle Master Trilogy* by Patricia A. McKillip)

* Medium Confusion--Focuses on Imagery, rather than Story or Emotional Depth.

* Repetition of Character Traits and Thoughts (ex: *Splinter Cell series* by David Michaels)

* Overuse of Epithets or Referring to Characters through Descriptive Phrases. 

* Anachronisms and Chronological Inconsistency

* Attempting to Force Character Traits--like Wit--without actually creating it (ex: Dan Brown)

* Cliche Scenes--Protagonists who Kill for the First Time

* Focusing too much on Scene

* Using Dreams or Prophecies to Forward the Story

* Overuse and Repetition of a Particular Phrase 

* Avoiding Character Depth for a Particular Character you put in the Story

* Treating the Audience as if they're of Below Average Intellect--Too Much Explanation

* Use of Standard Tropes

* Use of an Impossible Unexpected Situation or Deus Ex Machina without Reasonable Connection

* Cliche Description Scene using a Character looking into a Mirror

* Creating Logical Fallacy with Obvious Problems that Characters seem to ignore (Ex: Lost)

* Repetition of a Plot Sequence (Ex: *The Sword of Shannara* by Terry Brooks)

* Incomprehensible or Hard to Read ""Authentic"" Dialect/Dialogue (Ex: *Their Eyes Were Watching God* by Zora Neale Hurston)

* Characterization and Descriptions that are Too Forced--into Dialogue or Narration usually

* Unnecessary Sexual Description or the Sexualization of Characters

* Cliche Names that are Obviously meant to be Metaphorical or Representations for Something else

* Unable to Keep Dialogue Focused and Realistic (Ex: *Wired* by Douglas E Richards)

* Dialogue is strictly used to Advance the Plot 

* Use of Rhetorical Statements in Relation to the Plot 

* Referring to Futuristic Technology or Anything with a Cheesy or an Unbelievable Pseudonym 

* Referring to an Object or Something whose existence wasn't previously established

* Trivializing personal difficulties or serious handicaps without reason to

* Have an Antagonist explain his motives or intentions to another character 

* Creating Characters that are Flat and have either no or unbelievable Motivations 

* The use of the word ""you"" in narration and never filter out unnecessary words 

* Referencing other books for moral lessons or emotional emphasis (Ex: *In One Person* by John Irving)

* Elongated sentence structure and use of unnecessary obscure words 

* Focusing too much on visual details

* Using a vocabulary that is unrelated to the time period of the setting 

* Unnecessary objective depictions of character actions--attempt to add in more detail without necessity 

* Using the epilogue chapter for resolution 

* Flat Characters that could be described as being ""perfect"" or have flaws that are unrealistic 

* Repetition of short sentences to create tension or drama 

* Creating information dumps in dialogue ",,t5_2qh2n,1375112836.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/1e1r7y/as_both_readers_and_writers_what_are_common/

1338576170.0,ufzqw,Ten Things Indie Authors Can Do to Sell More Books by Me,,148,27,47,"1)	**Acquire new distributors**

a.	Amazon—you must be on Amazon. Only sign up for Kindle Select if you have 5+ titles or if your books are in a series.

b.	Barnes &amp; Noble—B&amp;N sells much fewer indie titles

c.	Apple—#3 ebook seller. Tougher to format for and less reward

d.	Smashwords—the aggregator distributor. They take a royalty for only one action. Not worth it to use them to distribute to the above markets. But they are worth it to distribute to their other partners.


2)	**Optimize your sales pages**

a.	Description—How many times have you rewritten your description? Have you tried split testing it? Try new things with your description and use book sales or NovelRank.com to track the ranking to see how it does over time. 

b.	Cover—Reinvest money you’ve earned on a new cover. Call it a new edition and you’ll have an excuse to launch it all over again.

c.	Tags—Look at the best 10 books in your category and steal all their tags. Comb through the keyword list and pick out the best ones. Use those tags.

d.	Price point—Higher price points now rank higher for equivalent sales volume of lower priced titles. That means you might want to raise the price of your book to rank higher. High ranks tend to rise you up in search/category listings


3)	**Connect with your readers**

a.	Newsletter—this is a critical one, put a sign-up form in your sidebar, and put a link in your email signature. Get everyone signed up and keep them posted on new releases, events in your career, etc. The power of this cannot be overstated. 

b.	Social Media—more important today than it was yesterday

c.	Video—Record yourself talking about what is important to you. People you meet will watch and perhaps subscribe to your Youtube channel. The numbers when you start don’t really matter. You can be happy that you’ve got the confidence to do it. Most people don’t.

d.	Podcast—you can host your own radio show online. But beyond that, they’ll check out your books. Your podcast can act like a rally flag for your readers.


4)	**Connect with book reviewers**

a.	Find book reviewers—stick to reviewers that review in your genre

b.	Refine your pitch—ask friends to review your pitch

c.	Maintain relationships—don’t drop off the face of the Earth after your review is placed. Send the occasional email or find the reviewer on social sites and connect there. Maintain that relationship and they’ll review all your future books too. 


5)	**Connect with writers with the success you want**

a.	Email—this is still the preferred contact method for most authors I’ve met. Always approach with a value proposition. Have something interesting or unique to say, it will take from being a bum asking for change to a potential business partner.

b.	Social media—once you are a fan

c.	Phone—this is the old school way to reach someone. That said


6)	**Connect with ebook podcasters**

a.	KindleChronicles—my personal favorite

b.	Selfpublishingpodcast.com—brand new podcast on the scene and the guys seem to be in the phase where they talk about themselves a lot. This is how most podcasts start

c.	Ishouldbewriting—this podcast has been around for a while and it hasn’t really broken out. It seems to have a decent audience and is worth pursuing.


7)	**Guest post for reading blogs**

a.	You should already know about guest posting


8)	**Join reading communities**

a.	KindleBoards.com—the biggest and best of the ereading forums. You should have a presence here.

b.	NookBoards.com—another great ereading board

c.	MobileRead.com—the smallest and most nerdy of the ereading boards. Sci-fi / fantasy authors should be happier here.


9)	 **Write and distribute a press release**

a.	Angle—press releases are for newspapers and now popular blogs to write an article about you and your book. You need to find a strong angle to approach your story from that will interest the press.

b.	Media kit—Description, and any multimedia you’ve produced to go with it.

c.	Find the key people you need to send release to – Use Google or http://everyonewhosanyone.com/

d.	Write the press release—Don’t attach your media kit. Either link to the downloads on your site or simply state if the reviewer is interested you can follow up with ebook and media kit. If you are doing a print run or POD

e.	Send to targeted people


10)	 **Start a new book**

Utilising these tips allowed me to write five novels since May of 2012, and a fourth which should be released October. So let’s get underway with Part One!

.


**Preparation is Key**

Success doesn’t favour the talented or even the lucky. Get that nonsense out of your head and focus on the key disciplines of the successful writer. Namely: preparation!

Thinking you’re going to be the next ‘overnight’ success and at the top of the NYT Bestseller list come Christmas is a fine thing to think. But it’s a thought full of hope and smoke, but it read along the lines of this: *We compare our own lives to everyone else’s highlight reel*. True, no?

What I’m getting at is we’re exposed to these overnight successes—books from first-time authors that sell a million+ copies in the first year, but for the most part success comes from discipline, hard work, and time management.

Being prepared to undertake such stringent management of your goals, is the only sure path on the road to success. You will wade in the river Failure at times, you will want to take shortcuts that end up costing more time in the long run, and you’ll want to be lazy. But wouldn’t you rather be successful?

Oh, but not a fair one. Success here is a completed novel, thus propelling you beyond 99% of people who consider themselves writers. Small steps that begin with proper, prepared time management!

.


**Trick #1: The Life Log – Or How I Learned to Embrace the Spreadsheet**

How are you with Microsoft Excel? Passing knowledge? Hard to avoid the program, here’s a bunch of free online courses.

A few months ago I wrote a post about keeping a [writing log](http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/11la0h/on_keeping_a_writing_log_and_hitting_a_daily_word/). I’m writing a follow-up post to that soon on how I expanded the initial spreadsheet to capture data such as time spent writing, and so on. I still stand by that writing log. Monitoring my productivity showed me just how simple the writing process could be—if you’re prepared for it. Here’s a screenshot of my writing log now:

[Image](http://joeducie.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/writing-log-screen-shot-2013-07-11-at-2-07-04-pm.png)

Note: my spreadsheet uses the Australian financial year, which meant a few days in the red. Back on form now!

But anyway: monitoring productivity. For example,000 words. Just over three days, you say? Yep. I know – I monitored. Those 75 hours were spread over 46 days, and as you can tell, I averaged a little over a 1,000 words an hour and wrote for just over an hour and a half a day. A month and a half isn’t too shabby for a novel-length first draft. Then came rewrites and edits, of course, a finished skeleton

Since using a writing log I’ve expanded the idea into other areas of my life. Most notably: finances. I keep a similar log monitoring my income/expenses. With a fortnightly salary, then it can be a little harder to monitor, as monthly income can vary. Use an average or find out from your publisher (easy for those using KDP), what to expect royalty-wise. Again, this is being prepared—the key tenet of time management.

Keeping a log makes sure I know where and when, and where it’s going, on every day of the month or year. Which leads me to my next trick…

.


**Trick# 2: Automate

If you’ve sat down and spreadsheet’ed your income/expenses, internet, and rent. Bills that are unavoidable but usually the same amount every month.

You set up a transfer from your cash account, what’s left, and can rest easy knowing that everything is paid on time, always, and that you only have to spend a few minutes every month ensuring those companies are charging you correctly. Being prepared like this removes stress, the nagging feeling of not having enough funds to pay the bills, and leaves you with extra time to write.

Moreover, bam! $300 please pay in 21 days, Mr. Ducie.

I grew tired of such expensive surprises. So for the last few registrations

Emergency Fund: $150 p/month x 12 months = $1800 (everyone should build an emergency fund).

Car Rego: $50 x 6 months = $300

Insurance: $70 p/month x 12 months = $840 (this one is particularly good and let’s me pay the year’s insurance bill all in one hit. Bonus: most insurance companies offer a discount for paying annually instead of by the month)

So as you can see, but this way I’m certain I’ll have the money, all my dollars and cents are accounted for and put to work, so when I pay the bill I do so feeling in control and (slightly less) resentful.

If you can afford it

Although this has very little to do with actual writing – indeed

.


**Trick #3: Carve Out a Slice of Writing Pie**

Okay

You have 24 hours in your day. We all do.

How many of those hours do you spend writing? How many should you spend writing?

If you look my writing log spreadsheet again, and green. The column turns green if I write 2000+ words on any given day, yellow on days between 1000 – 2000, and red for anything under 1000 words. I consider writing a responsibility, a proper job, and one where I must perform. Less than a 1000 words to me is not performing in my role (your average in two hours may be more or less, to each their own) and I know once I get underway I can write on average 2000 words in 2 hours. Find your average, and set traffic-light coded progress markers.

So of my pie cut into 24 slices, that’s kind of the point.

Some quick calculations:

24 hours a day:

Work: 8 hours (average work day)

Travel time: 1 hour (varies

Writing: 2 hours

Sleep: 7 hours

Current total = 18 hours

That still leaves you 6 hours in the day for any other tasks. Kids to school and back home if you have them, laundry, bit of TV of an evening or a pint at the pub. You won’t be wasting time paying bills, will you, because they’re all automated now. Again, preparation and carving your pie into adequate and fair slices for the given task will increase productivity, guaranteed.




Now can you think of any others ways to automate your lifestyle? Increase productivity? What do you do to manage time? I’d love to hear from you in the comments or an email.

**2.** Making room in your life to write generates even more room for writing.

**3.** Read outside your interests. There are over a million books published every year—and that doesn’t count stories just posted on the Internet. Pick up a New York Times bestseller that looks somewhat interesting

**4.** Write outside your interests; challenge yourself. If you write the same thing over and over, try writing something related: a murder mystery, or a romance, or a travelogue.

**5.** Ask yourself: what does this character want? Many examples of amateur fiction have the problem of a main character thrust into a plot. A narrative is more engaging when the reader knows that the main character wants something and wants him to get it (or doesn’t want him to get it!). “Here’s a neat character and then WHOA something happens to him” has the potential to lose the reader quickly, or the first chapter of a novel, what the main character wants. If we don’t, then we’d better be engaged for other reasons.

**6.** Write a thousand words every day. If you are going to get better at writing, every day.

**7.** Eliminate many of your adverbs, when you should be able to get the attitude just from the dialogue or from the actions. So it comes off as the author saying, “I’m not sure this came across, but just in case, have an adverb.”

**8.** Find a ‘writing buddy’ whose passion and interest matches yours. You may not have a lot of control over this one

**9.** You don't want the opinion of another writer - writers are competitors. If you are a writer

**10.** Proofread your finished manuscript backwards

**11.** Write what you know. How do you make that which is your everyday into the stuff of literature? Listen to your heart. Ask your heart

**12.**  What isn’t said is as important as what is said. In many classic short stories

**13.** Writing should be something that flows naturally - metaphors, anything, should form along with the story and not be dropped in haphazardly.

**14.** What's your character good at

**15.** Come up with your ending before you figure out your middle - seriously

Despite the often torturous moments writing can cause us, even uncooperative ones, than have a boring, depressing job.

Rule #2: DON'T BE AFRAID
For me

Rule #3: WRITE FOR ME
and 3a) Avoid the word ""should""
This doesn't mean totally disregard constructive criticism or your audience. It just means that first and foremost, no more saying ""I SHOULD write a family drama next because it's my usual genre and I need to add to my portfolio, but I really want to write sci fi."" Just write the sci fi - it's still writing practice, and since it's calling out to you, you'll probably have an easier time of it. On an even more practical note, if you have notes to address, and you think ""I SHOULD start with this scene because xyz

**THE RIVERSIDE SIGNAL FICTION GUIDELINES**

**WHO WE ARE**

The Riverside Signal is a small, we just want to create a great product. But we’re not simply devoted to the spirit of what a community newspaper can and should be, we’re also devoted to what newspapers USED to be – publishers of great fiction.

Some of the greatest works of literature of all time first appeared in newspapers and magazines. Harriet Beecher Stowe’s Uncle Tom’s Cabin was serialized by the National Era before becoming one of the most important novels in American history. Frank Herbert’s legendary Dune was first published in Analog. And almost the entirety of Charles Dickens’ work first appeared in newspapers. Among many

We want to bring back that tradition.

The Riverside Signal serves 10

**WHAT WE WANT**

We want good fiction. We have a particular leaning towards smart science fiction that tickles our Twilight Zone sweet spot

Previously published work is OKAY.

Previously unpublished work is OKAY.

We’re not worried about first rights or anything of the sort

*EDIT*
**RIGHTS**

We are seeking one-time, post it on their website, skywrite it, and feel free to do all of that even while it's in the paper. All we're doing is paying for the right to print it in the paper, once.

*EDIT*

**LENGTH**

Ideal length is 2

Works under 2,000 words begin to be too short for our needs. 

Works over 5, the Signal will work with the author to select an appropriate place to split the story.

Works over 20

**ILLUSTRATIONS**

The Signal reserves the right to hire an illustrator to create images to accompany your story

We do not currently publish illustrated fiction. Please do not submit it.

**COMPENSATION**

The Signal pays 3 cents per word or $150 per story 

Serialized stories will be paid as if each installment is a separate story

**HOW TO SUBMIT**

Email stories to fiction@riversidesignal.com.

Please send stories as ATTACHMENTS

Rich Text Format (.rtf) is preferred. Microsoft Word (.doc) is acceptable, Kindle format, or anything other than .rtf. .doc, or .txt.

Please allow 2 to 8 weeks for a response

Please DO NOT write to inquire about the status of your story. We will not respond. It may even bump you further down in the queue. So please refrain. You will hear from us when we’ve reviewed your story.

**MULTIPLE SUBMISSIONS**

Is your story currently submitted to another publication? That’s okay. We don’t care. Just make sure THEY don’t care

**WITHDRAWAL POLICY**

After you submit a story, we can’t.) We reserve the right to block submissions from authors who do not respect this policy.

If you withdraw your story because you want to improve it

**CONTACT**

If you have any questions

Please DO NOT inquire about the status of your story. We will not respond. It may even bump you further down in the queue. Please refrain. You will hear from us when we’ve reviewed your story.

Please DO NOT inquire about whether you should or should not submit your story. If you have doubts

Otherwise

Thank you.

I know this may seem like a whinefest, we should of course still have the fun threads/articles pop up occasionally but lately it seems all anyone ever posts is (and perhaps this is cynical of me) self-promoting how-to-write blog posts, and no actual writing. 

I know I could just leave if I don't like the things around here, but when it comes to our writing, I feel like we run the risk of homogenizing styles by tossing about the same few tips around and I constantly feel like place is becoming more of a black hole of procrastination than an inspiration.

1375387226.0,1jilt4,Organic Writing: A rant and some advice you may not hear very often.,tseudo,152,41,66," I decided I had to voice my opinion about something that's been bugging me on this subreddit and most of the other writing forums I spend any amount of time on. These 'Writer's Top 10' lists and posts with writing tips and tricks that every writer should conform to if they want to churn out as much quality writing as they possibly can.


 The fact that these lists exist isn't a problem at all. How widespread they are is. Everywhere I look I see them popping up and they all share the same advice over and over again to the point where a lot of fledgling writers (myself included) could begin to wonder 'am I doing this wrong?'


'Write at the same time every day'


'Write for the same amount of time every day'


'Plan. Plan. Plan.'


I think all of these rules are a terrible infliction on the writing craft. Especially the last two. If I felt forced to sit at a desk for 2 hours and not enjoy myself I'd soon hate what I'm doing and I do not want that to happen. With planning, I advocate not planning. and here's why:

 As I write my book I’m also reading it for the first time. Each time I finish a sentence and begin another I’m excited about where my story is going because I honestly don’t know. I find myself thinking ‘Oh shit

That's what I've been calling organic writing. Writing how much you want

Another thing about these lists is I think they stifle actual discussion of the craft. the more I see these lists posted the less I see people talking about the other, different techniques for writing certain things and discussions on plot and why certain things are lazy/genuinely interesting.

I realise the content on /r/writing has been pretty great recently but this is just something I really wanted to discuss.

1322769060.0,mwht8,My girlfriend of 7 years and I recently split up. We owned a house together. I wrote this while spending a night there while it's up for sale. I'd also been up for 2 days straight and working through some personal stuff.,washingmachinerage,140,30,24,"It’s a cold night. I hear the soft crunching noises of my boots as I walk through the freshly fallen snow and up the steps. My key unlocks the door. I go inside

Life is strange. Most of us don’t really live in our lives, a child’s future, a partner, tonight’s dinner. Our perspective is towards the future, not the present. We live in the foreshadowed footprints of our future selves. It’s not wrong. Maybe it’s just part of who we are. Maybe it’s supposed to be this way.

But there are also those who live in the past. Stuck in a moment, a person, an event that evokes that feeling of nostalgia. It’s a powerful thing. It can take the smallest memory and warp it into a life changing event. It can leave a man chasing a ghost for the rest of his life. Searching for something that never existed. Searching for a figment of his own imagination.

In reality

It’s quiet now. There are no sounds from the kitchen, as are the sounds of her voice. The house is an empty shell. The ghost of a past life. A place where memories were born and will stay in my mind forever. Nostalgia.

I stand in the doorway to our bedroom. The bed remains, see the way she breathes when she sleeps, the way she wakes up and looks at me, sleepy eyed, as I crawl into bed with her. It’s all so real. 

But, peering into a slice of a life that once was, not invited to go in, but allowed to stand outside and watch. Every doorway, a window to a different memory.

She’s sick so I rub her back. She’s can’t sleep so I scratch her head softly. I’m sick and she cares for me. I kiss her gently on the lips as we both lay down together. This was my present, when looking to the future, could only think of ways to rekindle those past feelings and memories. I was looking for a way back.

But that’s the reason nostalgia is so powerful. Memories like these can’t be doubted. There is no uncertainty in your mind. There is no attempting to make them happen, how it was. Nostalgia gets its power through it’s certainty. We look to the future with an air of worry, hope, praying things will work out the way we want them to. We look to the past with certainty and acceptance. We already know the result. The past is safe and secure.

Your future is not your past. Your present is your past and your present is your future. The present is all we have. It’s the only life we have that’s real. We can look back into a time that we think we once lived, the sounds, the smells. This is your life. It’s not ten years ago. It’s not ten minutes from now. It’s now. This life will be your past and your future. But you don’t get to live in either of those. There is no path in life.  Live in the present, but realize that everything you do and say will become both your past and your future. 

It’s been hours now. The sun rises over the horizon and shines through the bedroom windows. I walk downstairs. My feet are no longer carried throughout the house by the same motivation. Before, but that's gone now. The floor feels colder than usual. I take my final turn in the centre of the living room. I’m sure I’ll be back, but it won’t be the same. I take in this final moment of a frozen life. My frozen life.

I slide my key in the door and turn to leave. A flood of memories washes over me from the last six years. My realization is bitter. It’s only when I’m faced with leaving something behind that I can see it for what it is. My present is in my past’s nostalgia

I can see things for what they are now. I can see the present.

- *Straight promotion posts are great for the poster

That struck a chord with me. There are a lot of things I've learned that I wish someone had told me, someone will benefit from them.

1. **Writing doesn't have to be linear.** One of my worst habits was forcing myself to write like I read: From beginning to end. Sure, but when I finally did, I realized that the entire process was *much* easier. I could write little pieces as they came to me, and then it was just a process of editing them together.

2. **You will never write anything bad.** You might, but there's no such thing as a bad piece of a story... just one that doesn't fit. When you find something in your story that isn't working out - and you will - don't delete it! Instead, keep a separate file of those misplaced snippets, and come back to them when you're stumped. You won't always find gold there, but occasionally you'll surprise yourself.

3. **Tell the story, an iPhone app) which I turned on any time I started talking about my ideas. It also worked wonders for when I couldn't write something down immediately, like if I was out walking or grocery shopping (Also, if you use a voice-recorder app on your phone, you can pretend you're talking to someone, and people won't stare at you as much.)

4. **You're more than a writer!** I started drawing because I love telling stories, which means that even the worst artist can come up with something decent. As long as you're willing to learn - and you can keep yourself from getting frustrated - you can actually do a lot more than write. (In my case, I designed both the cover and the website for my novel.) Sure, writing the story is the most important part, but it's often the garnish that makes the meal look truly complete.

5. **Find a friend.** This, you'll not only have a critic, you'll have an audience, as well. Let me say from experience, there's nothing more motivating (at least for me) than having someone say ""I loved the latest chapter! When can I read the next one?""

6. **Put yourself out there.** Not everyone will like your work. Some people with *hate it with a fiery passion*

So *write what you feel like writing*,* and it will write itself, especially if you can *tell it to a friend*. As a writer, you're creative by default, so *learn new skills*, and challenge yourself with them. Then, when you're ready

1372037314.0,1gxvx4,Science supports Strunk &amp; White -- avoid complex language to avoid sounding dumb.,squidtropolis,125,25,76,"So a guy from Princeton named Daniel Oppenheimer won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2005 for proving that overly-complicated writing makes you sound stupid. 

Here's a link to [paper](http://www.ucd.ie/artspgs/semantics/ConsequencesErudite.pdf).

I thought his experiments were pretty brilliant

He conducted 5 experiments on Stanford undergrads

For the sake of those of you that hate reading science research

*Not in their original order

 

**Experiment 1**

Oppenheimer found some poor rube’s application essay for grad school. He took it

Not surprising

But, so it could have produced awkward-sounding sentences that leave a bad impression. Sure enough, look at intro that the thesaurus-bot produced:

“I desire to go to Graduate School so that I can learn to recognize literature satisfactorily. I want to investigate the characfter and connotation of the literary and its antecedents.”

Blech. Kid

That’s why he also did…

**Experiment 3**

In this one he followed the opposite procedure. He had his thesaurus mangle some grad-student’s dissertation abstracts

Think “satisfactorily” -&gt; “well.”

Since these altered texts would also sound a little written-by-robot

Most of the 35 undergrad readers loved the simplified versions. They rated the essays that had easier words as more clear

Even after controlling for robotic word-switching

One more bias Oppenheimer wants us to watch out for, some guy is trying to snow them.

To get rid of this bias

**Experiment 2**

This one was ingenious. Instead of using a computer to swap around words in the same essay

He found two different versions of a passage by Descartes, Oppenheimer told half of them who the original author was, while the other half thought it was “anonymous.”

And guess what – the students liked the simple version again. Even if the students knew the author was Descartes



There’s nothing sweeter than having a Princeton scientist agree with you. Strunk and White has always been my writing bible

So next time you’re tempted to reach for the thesaurus

I'm happy to answer any questions

Did I have an agent?  No.  I shopped the book around for a while, and I wanted to be on the cutting edge, not the legacy past.  

A [friend](http://www.toccon.com/toc2011/profile/102677) of mine was starting his own imprint.  He was going to try and carve a niche in the market focusing mostly on eBooks while bypassing trying to something in ""big box"" stores.  He wanted to know if I'd consider going through him.  Borders was slowly dying in the background so I was in.

My publisher's ideas were simple.  We would have more control and flexibility just doing it ourselves.  We'd look to maximize revenue to the author and cut out as much middlemen as possible.  And trust me the traditional legacy publishing industry is filled with middlemen looking for a cut.  

He did the developmental edit.  He hired a copy editor and a cover artist.  I retained a lot of control.  I got to work directly with the cover artist knit-picking on the details.  There were some hiccups and setbacks in the whole process

Did I miss out on anything important by going this route?  Maybe.  I still like the idea of wandering into a bookstore and seeing my book on a shelf.  That's still possible with what we're doing

So what's next?  We're finalizing the print version.  After the holidays

Anyway

tl;dr I published a book that you should buy.  Now.

**I was wondering if you could give me some advice on how to deal with structure? How do you deal with it?**

""You’re talking about writing a novel, and one of the things that is really noticeable is he is known for these wild collages, and then interspersing these are these really beautiful, very formally traditional oil paintings, portraits, and landscapes and so on.

And this is that old—I mean it’s a bit of a cliché--but the old thing about knowing the rules and being able to obey them before you can break them. Now I think that that is quite useful in terms of structure for novels because one of the things that stops people writing is kind of this panic at the scale of the thing, why not go completely traditional?

Think three-act structure, followed by a little dénouement. Think 30,000 words, 40,000 words, 30,000 words, around 100

If you front load that stuff, you’re able to go off in all kinds of directions because you know what you have to do in that day. You have to walk this character from this point to this point and you can do that in the strangest way possible. Whereas if you’re looking at a blank piece of paper and saying where do you I go from here you get kind of frozen.

1351284755.0,1255wr,I used to teach Kung Fu...,tinwhistler,117,24,25,"Before I moved to Virginia in 2010

There's a lesson that all beginners have to learn during their first couple of weeks: Your mind always gives up before your body does. New students always make a big show of grunting and collapsing to the ground during pushups after they get a little tired. But I know better; I've been doing this gig for twenty years. I know that they can do more. 

So

People don't like to be uncomfortable. At 80% they feel like they've made a reasonable effort

""You can be content with mediocrity

Some complain, all of them can do five more. Their brain gave up before their bodies did. The students who realize the truth in that lesson, and really begin to push themselves--those are the students that flourish. Everyone else fades away. Perhaps they get a new girlfriend, or a new hobby that they can pick up or put down whenever the mood strikes them. Something where 80% is good enough.

That's a lesson I try to carry with me in everything I do: that if you really push when life is uncomfortable

It's so easy to let life get in the way of writing. There's always one more meal to cook

It's hard to get up off the couch and go write when I'm working 50 hour weeks at my day job. It's hard to revisit the long-buried emotional traumas of my past and use them to try to breathe life into my characters. It's hard to carve out time away from my family so that I can spend that time and love on people who only exist in my imagination. It would be so much easier to watch one more episode of Dr. Who

I hope this takes off because I feel that Reddit
  
I'm hoping to find people who will commit to the full length of the course (naturally it's fine if you have to miss a week or so)
   
I'll be hosting under the username REDDITWRITINGCLASS in the aforementioned /r/fictionworkshop but please address all questions here or to redditwritingclass@gmail.com. Members of the workshop will receive posting privileges as they are accepted.   
    
If you're interested in signing up please send me a brief clip of your writing (no more than 500 words) to redditwritingclass@gmail.com.  
   
I'm looking forward to speaking with you and I hope this experiment is successful!

* **set writings goals and track your progress** towards reaching them.
* can easily share your writings with others in a pretty fashion (we think this is nicer than Google docs!)
* can import and export in all common document formats
* make use of several other features which have been implemented in a very heartfelt and nice way [keyboard sounds, etc.] :)

1340932558.0,vrt2p,"Why ""just write"" is sometimes the best answer",Carrot425,103,8,42,"I'm seeing a lot of questions that can only be answered by ""just write.""  Like [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/vr8b8/what_should_i_write_in_my_free_time/), I get it


Imagine you’re walking through a neighborhood and you see a kid sitting on a stoop, looking like he’s making a life and death decision.

“What’s wrong

“I’m trying to decide if I should play with dolls or go play tag

“I have no idea. Just do what you feel like.”

To your surprise

“But what if I play the wrong thing?” he asks, never realize how fast I am? On the other hand, maybe I could have become a famous fashion designer but  I never know because I never played with dolls!” 
 
This gives you pause. It’s a good point. Playing is how kids develop the basic skills they're going to use the rest of their lives. Tag develops a totally different skill set than dolls. Depending on what they do later in life, and you’re worried a cop will come by and you’ll end up on the sex offender list, somehow. 

On the other hand, maybe they’ll incorporate the experience of tag in a design one day.

Smiling

“Just go play

“Fuck you, that he started shitting himself. “That’s the bullshit answer everyone gives and it’s not helpful.”

This is what happens on /r/writing, sitting down and writing. That doesn’t mean questions about writing shouldn’t be asked. For example, if the kid was crazy about tag, he could ask “I’d like to improve my sprint. What’s the best diet?” That would lead to a concrete discussion. Even if there isn’t an exactly right or wrong answer, I could give an opinion that’s not just tied to my personal preferences and is therefore helpful to a stranger.

A handy clue to whether a question is good or a bad is that bad questions lead to answer backed by unquantifiable or unrepeatable experiences that aren’t necessarily applicable to strangers. In other words


**Bad Question:** “Should I outline on a computer or with notecards?” 

**Answer:** I don’t fucking know. I like outlining on a computer. My friend uses notecards. My other friend writes in his journal. We all like our method equally.


**Good question:** “What’s the best software for outlining on a computer?” 

**Answer:** Everyone I know who’s used Scrivener loves it.

**Bad Question:** “How much world building should I do in military sci fi?” 

**Answer:** I don’t know fucking know. I hate any world building. I know a ton of people who could read books of just world building.


**Good Question:** “I’m writing military sci fi but I want to know more about the military. Any recommendations on sources?” 

**Answer:** Me recommending a source. Someone might even disagree with me and we could have a discussion. That’s cool. Our discussion would be helpful to a stranger. 


So how do you figure out the bad questions? Write something with the question in mind. Show it to other people. Ask them pointed questions. Consider their answers. Read it yourself. Decide if you like it or not. Move on. In other words

2) Characters who exist in a void, plug in the characters dictated by that plot and dive right in. Not to undermine your enthusiasm, but there's a bit more to it than that. Ever heard the phrase ""The child is father to the man""? This builds off of what I said in my first point. If you have a character who almost drowned as a kid, he's going to be afraid of the water. That's obvious. But how does he deal with his fear. How have his parents, siblings, friends, teachers, which I prefer for longer fiction, and his voice is the narrative voice. Try creating real-life voices for them. Walk their walks. Eat their favorite food. Etc. Spend about an hour (and time yourself


3) World building. This is a fantasy/scifi world where science is more advanced and magic may or may not exist. Not only do your characters need to be real, space, magic and technology. The first two are pretty straight-forward, but for magic and technology, you should not only have what exists, but the limits. Once you have your pillars, put a roof on it. This is what's applying pressure to your world, build your walls,"" you need to know your settings, spend no more than an hour on this kind of thing.


4) Don't be afraid to suck. I mean, you fell on your butt. If you're unlucky, you face-planted onto concrete. But then you kept trying and eventually you got better. Writing is a talent, but it's also a skill. Keep writing, and you'll get better, and it will get easier.


5) Set a small, I know people who have, and they've told me that the next day, they can barely move. Same with writing. What I do these days is aim for 3 pages a day. That's double-spaced, 12-point Times New Roman. I don't stop in the middle of paragraphs or sentences. Sometimes, there's a natural pausing point at 2, 2 and a half, that's about 200-300 words

So I guess my question to Redditors is this: when you're working with very depressing

How much death and danger can you put your characters in the face of without stressing the reader to the point that they cannot finish the story for fear of what will happen?

EDIT: I think the thing I'm most afraid of with my book is the ""children taboo"". In Western culture it's pretty frowned upon to depict harm to children in the media, war orphans starving to death, children killed in nuclear attack, that kind of thing. I wanted a theme of the book to be how war affects children and how that violence reverberates across generations. I know a lot of people, especially parents, who claim that they can't stand to see children get hurt, even fictionally.

1335623776.0,swst9,Submitting material for feedback? Please follow these guidelines,dreamscapesaga,95,7,35,"**Step 1: Create a helpful title**

- Use appropriate tags. At a minimum, if you are a beginner, you may include a [beginner] tag. Use of such tags gives everyone an idea of what to expect going into the critique.

- Provide the title or proposed title.

- Consider stating the intention of the project.

Example 1: [critique] [fantasy] Writing Exercise - The Magical Mushrooms of the Dark Forest - 2800 words

Example 2: [critique] [article] [beginner] Alternative Medical Uses for Tampons - 700 words

Example 3: [critique] [true crime] Short story for publication - Death of a Brony - 1600 words

**Step 2: The author statement**

- Include a blurb about yourself. Tell us a bit about your background, the better a reader can target their critique. Even if they presented the same material, I would not provide the same critique for a student and a professional author.

- Tell us what kind of critique you're after. Do you need a proofreader, so it's important that you let us know what you want from the start.

- Let us know your intentions for the work. If you're going for publication

**Step 3: The writing sample**

- In the body of the Reddit post

- The writing sample should be indicative of the entire work. It makes no difference if it comes from the beginning

- If your story or excerpt is short enough to post in Reddit in its entirety, but feel free to post a link leading elsewhere.

**General Guidelines**

- Only post your material. If your friends or family members truly want a critique

- Complete the story and attempt to edit the material yourself before posting. In truth

- Do not post an idea for a story for critique. Virtually any story imaginable

- Consider posting in another sub. While /r/writing is the largest writing subreddit, or /r/LitWorkshop.

- Critiques are give and take. If you would like a critique of your work

- Do not take offense to any response. If you ask for a critique, or just plain wrong. Feel free to ask for clarification, but do not take offense, and do not become combative. No matter how harsh a critique may seem, a review from the public will hurt much more. If someone crosses the line from harsh to blatantly abusive, hit the report button, and the moderators will handle it appropriately.",False,Career,http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/swst9/submitting_material_for_feedback_please_follow/

So far this morning I’ve seen two articles and a Reddit conversation about the need for editors in the self-publishing world. It’s become obvious to most that self-publishing is not going away. With every novice writer wanting to be the next Amanda Hocking

As a reader, the books were barely better than first drafts. The only exception was The Third Scroll by Dana Marton, and though it was more fleshed out than the others, it still read like a spruced up outline rather than a fully realized novel.

It’s not just grammatical errors that I’m talking about. Each of these books, at least in the beginning. Pretty quickly, however, it all begins to fall apart. All of the characters end up talking the same, the authors explain everything out in detail for the reader instead of trusting us to pick up on clues, and the worlds lose their luster.

As a writer, calling a story done after an initial draft is a misnomer. All the writer has done at this point is put the story on paper. The real work is in the editing process.

Currently it seems as if most editing among self-published authors focuses on grammatical errors

Humans have this weird attraction to first impressions, and often times we’re unable to see the work they need on the page. Because of our own bias toward our own work, no writer should ever be his own final editor.

If you are a self-published author, then keep it in there, but remember, it’s all on you if that’s the thing your readers end up hating.

Editors don’t have the ulterior motive that writers have. They’re not trying to protect their own egos or save their darlings. Editors are paid to make a story better. As such

I understand that many new authors cannot afford an editor. The next best thing is to try and find someone to do it for free, and they come back with nothing but a glowing review, move on and find someone else. Every good editor, and reader for that matter, will have something constructive to say.

**TL;DR** - Authors are biased toward their own work. If you're self-publishing,False,,t5_2qh2n,False,,,t3_vmrs9
1317597821.0,kyrzx,Something I Picked Up Today,Humdinging,99,15,9,"I was in the nursing building of my university when I found this printed out piece of paper that made me laugh until I cried. Just wanted to share it with all of you: 


**FOURTEEN PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE APPETIZERS**

**by Yoni Brenner**


1. Top thick slices of country bread with fresh goat cheese. Sprinkle with herbs and bake until crusty; serve to everyone but Jeff.

2. Vegetarian friends? Try veggie rumaki: wrap a strip of imitation bacon around a water chestnut, and instead of a water chestnut use veal.

3. Steal Cheryl’s famous potato-salad recipe. When Cheryl asks, “I don’t know, Cheryl, why did you break my heart?” Then laugh so she knows you’re just kidding.

4. Blend fresh crabmeat with diced avocado, act mortified and stammer that you must have “mixed up the boxes,” until everyone calms down. Then start crying because the biscuits remind you that today marks exactly eight weeks since you had to put down Buster, and you just miss him so much.

5. Tell Marissa that you appreciate her concern, “Speaking of fiancés, how’s Peter’s alcoholism?” (Note: This is not technically an appetizer.)

6. For a taste of the U.K., oddly enough, all seem to be printed with unfavorable reviews of Jeff ’s novel.

7. Have you ever noticed how sun-dried tomatoes and top-grade peyote look exactly the same? Not a suggestion

8. Another one for the vegetarians. If they think they like tofu, and five cups of piping-hot tallow. Cheryl will never know the difference.

9. Tempura makes great finger food, from squash blossoms to mislaid car keys to the two-carat engagement ring that Cheryl gave back to you after she “reassessed things.” Surprise!

10. Guests getting antsy? Head them off with a big bowl of steamed mussels. No one can resist mussels

11. Homemade sugared almonds make the perfect sendoff, but he’s very large.

12. As the party disperses, it’s probably the peyote talking. Just stand on the porch as their cars pull out, your eyes brimming with tears, and shout, “You know, I try, I really do . . .”

13. Add

14. Hepatitis! (Note: This is not technically an appetizer.)

Throughout the rest of the book, I'd have this perfect image of a tall, sturdy brunette woman with shoulder-length hair and solid green eyes. Reading it and noticing the early descriptions, turns out she was short, long-haired and blonde with blue eyes. So whoops. The image that stuck in my head produced more emotion, because every time I replaced the author's character, I felt less of a connection and less impact. I just couldn't picture that combination of physical characteristics with her personality.

And since I wind up writing what I know, sometimes their build, (""The overseer who looked like he wrestled bears in his spare time said,""), the way they speak and maybe toss in their fashion sense and basically tell the reader, ""Fuck you.

1371822274.0,1gskj1,I uploaded my first novel to Amazon a week ago. This is a detailed postmortem.,WillWeisser,86,8,72,"Hi, and I thought you might be interested in hearing my honest assessment of the experience. 

Here's the [obligatory link to my book, on to the story.

The book started one day when I was bored driving, but it seemed more interesting to me than the whole ""hey we found a magic door"" thing). I had been wanting to write a book for a while, so I started brainstorming more, trying to see if I could build a story around that initial seed. The way I conceived of it, traveling between universes was a skill that must be learned, so I decided I wanted some of the action to take place in a school, and for there to be an antagonist who was a former student

That was about the state of the ideas I had kicking around my head when I stumbled on the [snowflake method](http://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/articles/snowflake-method/) a week later. This was enormously beneficial as it gave me a framework which happened to fit my personality--put simply, and I like knowing how much I have left to finish (whenever I didn't feel like writing on a particular day, I would always repeat to myself ""eleven more chapters to go, just eleven more, do this one, then there'll be ten..."").

In the case of the Reintegrators, but suffice to say it gets complicated, hopefully in a good way). I didn't initially write detailed outlines for what happened within the chapters, although I did do some “just in time” pre-summaries for scenes which were giving me trouble (it wasn't until much later when I read [2k to 10k](http://www.amazon.com/2k-10k-Writing-Faster-ebook/dp/B009NKXAWS) that I realized I should be doing this for every scene). I also wrote out little 1-2 paragraph descriptions for each major and minor character, as well as 1-2 pages of notes for each alternate world they visit. All told, it took around six weeks to finish all of the pre-production.

Then came the writing. I used Word again (I've tried Scrivener since, and walk away feeling like I was well on the way to the great American novel. Of course, in reality I had no clue at all what I was doing, but at least as a result I avoided the self-consciousness that plagues so many budding writers. One thing I'll say about finishing that 90k-word first draft: typing the words ""THE END"" was one of the most satisfying rushes I've ever felt in my life. Nothing else in my writing ""career"" has ever come close, especially not the final publication of this book, which is just one long nerve-wracking nightmare. After that, I was anxious to get started editing, bought a set of nice Pilot red pens

And that's where my troubles began. Even though I had been revising each chapter as I went along, I had no idea how to fix it. I would circle whole pages in red pen, go back on the computer and re-write them--and they'd be just as awful as before. But still, I persevered. After two months of revising, I had increased my word count to 100k, and put the book aside with the idea that I would give it one more coat of polish before submitting it for publication.

Several things happened around that time. I found a little book called [The Craft of Writing Science Fiction That Sells](http://www.amazon.com/Craft-Writing-Science-Fiction-ebook/dp/B006MAZPEI), and most of them were way better at it than me. I submitted some other stories I had written for critiques, and got duly ripped apart. But somehow it felt amazing. Yes, it sucked to find out that I sucked. But really, it was just confirming what I knew already, deep down. And for the first time I was actually being given the tools to critically evaluate myself, to stop editing in circles and say ""yes, and I'm confident in that decision.""

Time passed. I wrote and published a novella and some short stories. I became a craft-book junkie and spent way too much time on reddit, and was stunned to realize just how much my writing had changed. On the bad side, there was no way I could just quickly edit that mess and then submit it to agents like I had planned. But at least now I knew what had to be done. The first quarter of the book had to be chopped up and cut down to get things moving. I changed the main character drastically, giving him more motivation and making him more of an active player in the plot. I cut tons of material from existing scenes: extraneous words, stupid asides and weird ideas that didn’t contribute anything to the final plot. All told, I removed 20k words to bring the final count down to 80k. I did all of this with two Word documents in split-screen mode, reading the old manuscript on one side and writing a fresh one on the other. Then, really polishing this time

That process took around 3 months. On the plus side, they weren't ALL bad), and were essentially done at that point. But there was also a lot of brand-new material that was added even after the initial re-write, and that stuff probably wasn't quite good enough to show the public yet. The problem was that I was pretty goddamn sick of the book by then, and really just wanted it off my back so I could move on to other things.

I researched agents, so I sent out some more. More form rejections. At this point I was distracted (in a good way) working on another fantasy novel (to be finished this year I hope), so I was taking my time, continuing to tweak my messaging as I sent more letters. But no matter what I did, all I got back was forms. I never did succeed in receiving an actual personalized response from anyone.

Looking back, as I believe that would have given me a huge advantage. Probably my opening pages could have been tweaked, as could my query letter (hint: if you can't imagine the blurb in your query on the back of your published book without getting embarrassed, it's not very good). But even if none of that were true, and I had everything going for me, let's face it: getting published is fucking difficult. Oh well.

In any case, instead of continuing until I had queried every single agent and publisher in the industry. But I guess the idea of leaving the book in limbo for years on the very small chance someone would pick it up just didn't appeal to me. At least if I get it out there now, I stand a chance of someone hearing about my work, instead of being just another anonymous entry in the slush pile. It's not as if I've given up on my goal to be traditionally published--it just won't be with this book. But I think I have at least a few more left in me.

Of course, and why I'm sitting here, writing a 2000-word postmortem instead of sleeping.

But anyway, and eventually decided that I liked [R.J. Locksley](http://rjlocksley.blogspot.com/) the most. She ended up giving a lot of useful feedback about the book of course (in addition to the line corrections), but overall her impression was very positive, which certainly helped lift my spirits after all those harsh rejections. For the cover, I searched around for a designer whose work looked the most professional and striking, and settled on [Damonza](http://damonza.com/). I personally love the cover I ended up with, even though I probably screwed up its salability by demanding he make it exactly the way I always envisioned it, I have somewhat particular tastes in covers which don't necessarily align with what is in fashion at the moment. This is the downside to self-publishing--you're free to make your own success

And then, although there were some new twists as always, in particular figuring out print formatting for the first time (I wrote up a little log my experiences with that [here](http://metanautics.net/2013/05/15/adventures-in-book-layout/)). So I filled out the forms, clicked the mouse, and just like that, it was done. After all this waiting, it feels peculiarly sudden. Maybe a little empty. On one hand, and yet in another way it’s not. If things had gone differently and I had been accepted for publication, or even whether or not I can get any readers at all.

So, which forced me to examine my own flaws even as I gave advice. And for the four of you that actually read this far, thank you for your attention and good luck with your writing.

Dear Smashwords Authors

This email is being sent to all authors

According to our records

Today we are modifying our Terms of Service to clarify our policies regarding erotic fiction that contains bestiality, you can disregard this message.

PayPal is requiring Smashwords to immediately begin removing the above-mentioned categories of books. Please review your title(s) and proactively remove and archive such works if you are affected. 

I apologize for the short notice

As you may have heard

On Saturday, PayPal gave us only a few days to achieve compliance otherwise they threatened to deactivate our PayPal services. I've had multiple conversations with PayPal 
over the last several days to better understand their requirements. Their team has been helpful

Their hot buttons are bestiality


The underage erotica is not a problem for us. We already have some of the industry’s strictest policies prohibiting underage characters (we don’t even allow non-participating minors to appear in erotica)

The other three areas of bestiality
tackle these one-by-one below

*Incest:* Until now, and many of them have ""Daddy"" in the title. I wouldn't be surprised if the surge in ""Daddy"" titles prompted PayPal to pursue this purge (I don't know). PI usually explores sexual relations between consenting adult stepchildren 
with their step parents

Like many writers, erotica is little different from a literary novel that puts us inside the mind of farm animals 
(1984), and to feel. Sometimes we want to feel touched, moved, or disturbed. A reader should have the right to feel moved however they desire to be moved.

Incest
Smashwords directly threatens our ability to serve the greater interests of all Smashwords authors
The slippery slope is dangerous

*Bestiality:* Until now
I like animals. Call me old fashioned or hypocritical (I’m not a vegetarian), sell it, or distribute it. The TOS is now modified to reflect this. Note this does not apply to shape-shifters common in paranormal romance provided the were-creature characters are getting it on in their human form. Sorry I need 
to clarify it that way

*Rape:* Although our Terms of Service prohibits books that advocate violence against others

Non-consensual BDSM - or any other form of non-consensual violence against another person - is prohibited. 

*NEXT STEPS:* If you have titles at Smashwords that are now expressly forbidden
by the end of day Monday (Feb 27)
and click UNPUBLISH then click ARCHIVE. This will also cause our automated systems 
to remove the titles from retail distribution.

The blog lasted a year or so – I worked on longer versions of the posts and had around 18 short anecdotes in total. The blog did well based on word-of-mouth from the Soulstrut forum and I enjoyed seeing the little traffic spikes as new messageboards would discover my little stories.

Then one of the Soulstrut members approached me via private message saying he was looking to set up a small independent artist collective and that if I could weave my anecdotes into an actual story – he would publish them. 

Chris Portugal is better known as Thes One – Rapper

Thes put me in touch with his friend Justin

It was then that I realised just how much work was going to be involved in stripping back those anecdotes

I wrote the character descriptions in one night – I had lived and worked with these people years ago

**My character description method:**
I described each character physically

I also described the music each character listened to as I felt this added another layer to the complete picture. This assigning of musical themes ended up becoming a major theme throughout the finished work and I have had many people comment that it is one of the things they like best about the book. 

**Lesson 1: Go with your gut**
Using music as a way to describe a character (or scene) just felt right to me and this translated naturally rather than feeling forced. Justin recognised that I felt comfortable doing this and encouraged me to continue.

I was still coming up with excuses not to write about myself and even sent through a barrage of alternate opening chapter ideas in the hope that Justin would become distracted.

No such luck.

By forcing me to revisit the time when I was a broken hearted

**Lesson 2: Write what you know – don’t fake it.**
I cringe when I think of some of the fake crap I sent through before realising that the real good work is the honest stuff – those words that come when you detatch your ego and just fuckin write the truth. It was hard because I still did not consider myself a writer – deep down I was some guy who was faking it and was terrified that someone would ask to see my writers credentials.

Then Justin suddenly left due to a family illness and the whole project looked shaky. I just plugged away

The lesson I learned during this time is the old one we have all heard a thousand times

**Lesson 4: Just. Write.**
Just write – keep going, they were where new ideas were tested, bad ideas were exposed and where little nuggets hid. Just Keep Writing.

To cut a very long story short

**Lesson 5: Embrace negative feedback.**
I would send pages to friends and hear things like “It was great” or “I really liked it”. What the hell can you do with that? I was aching for someone to tell me it sucked and why. When Wiel did

**Lesson 6: Read your words aloud.**
GOLD advice originally from Thes but taken to a whole new level by Wiel and I when we read the thing like a script. If anything you have written is clunky or awkward – it will stand out when you read aloud. 

Plus reading dialogue back and forth with a friend is fun especially when that dialogue includes the type of conversations that happens in porn stores. 

So I had all these pages and Wiel and I had whittled a pretty good story out of them but it still didn't feel ready. By now we had all these parts, we knew the end, but it just needed tightening up.

**My Lego brick method:** I considered each of these chapters/scenes/moments as a Lego brick. I literally wrote the name of each on a separate piece of paper and started reordering them on the floor in my living-room. When I found a promising new build I would open the laptop
 
All good and well

**Lesson 7: You need a real editor.**
Grammar, the editor edits. The state of the manuscript I foisted upon poor Tom... ouch. But he weaved his magic and turned my endless chains of words separated by commas into actual sentences. 

What he delivered back was an actual book. You need a real editor.

 
This has turned into a novel itself, you deserve something so i’ll send a free copy of the eBook to the first 5 people who reply.

Sometimes a name can be chosen through trial and error--a syllable here

What about all the other times? There are random name generators online which may useful for throwaway characters

Here's what I do: download a database of names and sort/filter the data until I find what I'm looking for.

First name database: http://www.lexique.org/public/Prenoms100.zip (linked from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/362202/is-there-a-free-or-low-cost-database-of-first-and-last-names).

Last name database (based on the US census

The latter file comes as .csv and .xls (Excel)

Once you have the data in the spreadsheet, I select Data -&gt; Filter, then click the arrow in cell C1 (language). I click ""Clear"", then type ""welsh"" in the search box, then click ""Select all,"" followed by OK. Then I filter column B (""genre"") and select only male names. From here, I can filter or sort by starting letter, or frequency of use in a similar way until I find a name I like.

Filtering in Excel works approximately the same way, does not equal, begins with, contains, etc.).

**Entry 1 :**

The orbiting command module engaged its primary engines like a bottle rocket with an all too short fuse. Champagne corks popped

""Houston

""Mr. Aldrin

Sweat fogged the inside of Neal's helmet. Buzz stood like a statue

""Houston ... we're open to suggestions. Houston?""

The transmitter in Neal's helmet sat silent. Buzz could hear a defined ringing in his ears as he stood looking at the earth above. The sound of silence

""Neal. Buddy. Have you ever read 'The Swiss Family Robinson'?"" Buzz said from his perch on the landing module.

**Entry 2 :**

Neal stood

""'The Swiss Family Robinson' its about a family that survived a shipwreck and had to start a new life on an island paradise. Granted

""Buzz

A sharp static from the in helmet communicator cuts his dialogue

""Yeah

""Hey

""Buzz

""Fine

Neal's eyes shut. Let's a sigh only Atlas could relate to. Everything disappears for a moment. Just a man with his thoughts.

""Yeah

**Entry 3 :**

""Neal

Neal's eyes opened. His vision blurred by the sweat dripping from the inside of his helmet. Buzz lightly tapped on the glass with his gloved finger.

""Buzz. Sometimes you have to leave a man with his thoughts.""

""I know

""Fuck the Rolling Stones""

""Neal

""We would prefer it if you avoided swearing while on mic as a means to preserve your image for future generations. No one wants an FCC fine if this is broadcast

Neal stepped away from the lunar lander, California.

""Neal. NEAL. What are we going to do?""

""I'm going for a walk Buzz. I'm going. for. a. walk.""

**Entry 4 :**

Even through the vacuum of space, the first of its type by man. Every word uttered will be transcribed and memorized by children the world over for generations.

Even a death caused by folly will be considered heroic

""Hey Neal! Mission control was wondering if we'd like stuff to be named after us in tandem?""

""What?""

""Tandem. Like 'Neal Armstrong &amp; Buzz Aldrin High School'.""

""I think there are more important things to worry about

Buzz's helmet transmitter crackles on like a mosquito stuck in a screen door.

""We'll have to get back to you on that Houston""

""Copy that. I've talked it over with the head of the Houston school board, something inspirational.""

""Hey Neal! You hear that? We're going to get a fountain!""

Neal sighed

""Mission control! Neal's coming back! I think he's excited about the fountain! Neal!""

Buzz waved at Neal with the enthusiasm of a child watching an approaching ice cream truck.

""Mission control

""Neal

""Forget it.""

Neal shuts off his helmet transmitter as he nears the lunar lander.

""Buzz

**Entry 5 :**

Buzz shuts the door of the lunar lander behind them. A hiss fills the minivan sized chamber as oxygen pumps into its every crevice. Neal removes his helmet like a boxer at a round break. With his now glove less hand he wipes the condensation from the inside of his visor.

""Buzz

""Neal

""We are going to die Buzz. We'll die as heroes sure

""But our memories will live on ... ?""

Buzz gives an optimistic smile as he bites into a freeze dried ice cream.

""I'm just saying Neal

Buzz and Neal sit in silence for a moment.

""I wonder if we can get them to form up a super group? Oh man that'd be awesome! Imagine it Neal

Buzz finishes his ice cream.

""Neal? What should we call the super group Neal? The Rolling Beatles? The Beatle Stones? Beatle the Rolling?""

Buzz's pleas fall on def ears as Neal scribbles on a notepad. Each scratch and mark left with the focus of Moses atop Sinai. The thunder of his pen roars through the silence.

""Buzz

**Entry 6 :**

The NASA Mission Control Center in Houston

""Houston

""Copy that. We heard you have a plan?""

Neal glanced at his note pad like a high school student with eyes on a test he'd barely studied for. Each pause and breath was punctuated by a combination of the heavens and his slight chattering teeth.

""Well

""So you're proposing ...""

""Luna 15. It flies overhead in two hours.""

**Entry 7 :**

During the space race of the 1960's, and flight plans as a means to help, or at least not inconvenience each others quest for knowledge.

Still

""Luna 15! The Soviet Space Probe?""

""Exactly. Houston

""Neal

Neal glanced out the lunar lander's triangular window. The great blue marble sunk below the horizon in front of him. The American Flag stood proudly planted. Unmoving. Buzz sat in the corner of the module

""Buzz

**Entry 8 :**

""Neal

""Houston, I'm okay with splitting the soil and moon rocks with them.""

Buzz looks up from his bucket list.

""You can split your moon rocks with them.""

""God damnit Buzz. Shut up and put your suit on.""

It's a part-time thing, along with the question of: How do you tell people that art is important after something like this? 

The week after 9/11, I said basically the same thing I did last night. 

Here is what writing can give you, or sinners trapped in mortal skinsuits and waiting patiently for death and Paradise, but as human beings making choices, which lead to consequences and other choices, which lead to consequences and other choices, and so on and so on, unto the moment of their death. Thereby, from yourself to your Dutch uncle to the worst villain you can name

Whoever it was who put a pressure cooker full of nails, so that human beings became nothing more to them than paper targets. Being a writer -- thinking like a writer, experiencing life and relationships like a writer -- can insulate you from that kind of simplistic thinking. It can help you see that even if you don't agree with someone's choices, they came to those choices the same way you came to yours: which is, of course, with the tools they have, and the best way they know how.

It's easy to throw around the word ""evil"" at a time like this, writers don't believe in ""evil,"" because they know ""He did it because he was evil!"" is telling, not showing, the original sin of writing. It's the coward's way of explaining things. It's the thing people say so they don't have to consider that we, as humans, have both the capacity for unfathomable love and the capacity for unimaginable cruelty in our hearts.
