1375314122.0,1jgh8y,Got a call from Yelp.com today...,BostonCab,111,7,60,"So I own a small taxi co started it myself love it...blah blah yada yada..
I am no stranger to yelp and it's problems. I am only glad that things are not as bad for transportation businesses as they are for the restaurants. This thread is not at all about their review filter but more so about their sales practices. 

The yelp rep has been calling me for a little over a week. I am sure this is because I edited my listing recently and it must have set off some kind of flag to call and try to sell me. 

So for a week this guy is calling leaving messages on a phone line my drivers refer to as ""the fuggin azzhole hotline"" one of them noticed it was the number I give people I have no interest in speaking to and named it that. 

So a week the guy calls leaves a message I call him back and leave a message. Today I see the line ringing and its lit up 212 area code so I knew it was probably him. I answered and we exchanged pleasantries and he went on to inform me that my yelp profile was driving LOTS of traffic to my business and he wanted to ""set up a time"" where we could go over how to drive ""WAY MORE"" traffic to me.. ""flood me with customers"" I said ""how much traffic""?  he says ""LOTS"" I say ""no seriously how much traffic has yelped pushed to me so far this month"" he dances a bit and I can hear him looking it up clicking keys (this is where I start to get heated
He says ""I see right here 32 views and 9 customer actions"" I literally chuckled. I get upwards of 10

So not taking a breath he goes on to tell me he wants to ""schedule a time where we can sit down together in front of computers and talk about how much traffic he can push to me"" I responded ""I am here now. I am well versed in ppc ppa cpm what can you tell me?""

He says well ""how is 4pm today for you?"" huh? You called me 4 times this week to SELL me and you don't have a set of packages in your cheat sheet ready to throw at me? 

He sense me getting angry and says ""Well whey don't I call you back in 6 quick minutes and i`ll have something put together for you"" Now I am HEATED. ""My friend do you really work for yelp"" ""yes I do and I want to drive..

I cut him off.. ""yelp more or less makes their living off of small business listings right? You should have lots of experience with this right?""  ""Yes which is why I want the opportunity to schedule.. ""

So you know I run a small business do all the marketing book keeping..all of it on my own you called me 4 times in one week to try to sell me and now that you have me you are totally unprepared to sell me and are now being rude enough to try to sell to me at your convenience? ME. The small business owner who has no time for foolishness.. ""?

""Buddy

I am not sure what it is you think you are selling with the 1 star extortion shuffle you got going on but you are rude arrogant and your company is disgusting. Good day to you sir""

I guess that review filter will be turned up to double plus stun now huh?

1374618490.0,1iwz05,Just Got my First 1-Star Review on Yelp,snouzer,80,7,98,"Here's a background about my small retail business I started. About a couple months back, even our price beat neighboring competitors who didn't offer as much as us. The point was to show everyone that we were not only cheaper

Well, when I started yelping myself. Never became an elite but several friends have. I told her that I knew Yelp was a valuable tool but I felt like we weren't ready to start advertising with them since I hadn't hired enough quality therapists yet to start promoting big. She said she'd call me back in a week and touch base. During the call, she explained how there were 19 other active massage/reflexology businesses on Yelp within 5 miles and how I needed Yelp in order for an upper hand against these 19 other choices. I checked on Yelp and there were only about 6 competitors, only 2 had reviews for them. I thought it was weird, but thought nothing of it.

Last night, but never found the customer. The profile for the review was created within the same hour the review was posted and there was nothing else filled out on the profile, just a picture that looks like it could've been pulled off of anywhere (instagram? even reddit). I replied the best I could, but I thought it was highly suspicious how an account could be created, a negative review written and it becomes a permanent review as opposed as a ""filtered"" review. My past experiences doing web reputation for companies has taught me that creating an account on Yelp and writing any review right away would automatically flag it as ""filtered"" until you prove yourself otherwise that you're not spam through more reviews, check-ins, etc. This profile

I've flagged the comment, nothing has happened and it's gotten me really upset. Does anyone know what to do in this situation? Any suggestions?

1. Have a great product or service
The easiest thing in the world to market is something that people really want.
If people don’t want what you are creating

2. Know your customer
Many small businesses go with the spray and pray method of sending out messages in all different directions and hoping for the best.
The questions you have to ask yourself are 1. What problem are you solving? And 2. Who needs this problem solved? When you can identify your exact ideal customer

3. Small Victories
We live in such an age of instant gratification
Life doesn’t work that way. The best way to market on a budget is to go directly to people and sell them your product or service. Can you make one sale today? And then another tomorrow? Have a small victory each day

4. Relationships
Challenge yourself to meet people
When you create relationships, these relationship can lead to cross-promotional opportunities, partnerships or simply a valuable resource to keep in mind.

Most hot dog stands are run by redneck old dudes but I was an arrogant 20 year old college kid...so I (unfortunately) didn't take a lot of their advice because I wanted it to be young and hip.

2. How to buy a cart
3. How to get certified by the health department
4. Step-by-step website set up

9. Email and phone templates for cold calling places when asking to set up on their property
10. Templates for fairs
11. How to interact with customers
12. Little tips like adjusting prices for lunch vs. drunk night hours
13. Other ""dirty secrets"" like using cheap ketchup on drunk people
14. How to pay taxes
15. How to cook

The best opportunity we've had so far is a place called Touch Of Modern that at least fulfills the orders themselves. No one is ordering more than 3 at a time. With a new company, I'm left with 5 hanging around. Also, I don't understand why they still deserve 50% off retail when all they do is list items and provide me with an address.

1376513565.0,1kdgtg,My startup business is doing much better than I anticipated but I'm a one-man operation and very behind on my orders. Has anyone else been in a similar position that would like to suggest ways of turning one-man shows into thriving companies?,JOSEPH_LEMIUS,22,4,40,"Some background: 

I started an exporting company (based in the US) where my main customers are abroad and my vendors are US manufacturers. I started this business on my own and have been mainly using a combination of Word, Purchase Orders, Statements, and all other documentation. All orders I receive through my Outlook account or over the phone with close customers. 

The amount of work has been very manageable until about four months ago when my business suddenly picked up drastically as my email and phone orders increased nearly ten-fold. I had to work weekends as well as 70-80 hour weeks to keep up with just the paperwork and email responses and my marketing / customer service efforts were forced to be put on hold and this is becoming very detrimental to my company's reputation. 

I've realized that hiring employees is the obvious next step but I haven't the faintest idea of how to divide up the duties for this job. The main reasons that kept me from hiring employees in the first place is:

1) All my orders and customers speak a foreign language. I am bilingual so I have been able to handle all their requests and build relationships

Also

2) I am very cautious of hiring a fellow bilingual employee because there is a very big risk in my line of work (as I've seen with fellow exporting companies) of employees learning the vendor names and customers and stealing the business whole. This is probably the main reason I've kept this essentially a one man business this whole time. 

Things I would love to implement into my business:
1. A team of employees that handle all Purchase Orders, and Billing
2. A Customer service team that responds to all email questions and inquiries.

This would leave so much more time for me to focus on moving the company forward instead of just fielding orders and complaints.

**Local Search for offline business's:**

* Citations: The most important thing you can do for your offline business is to build citations. Citations are business listings such as yelp, the more authority google gives your company. Here is a list of (mostly) free citations that you can submit your business to: http://searchengineland.com/top-50-citation-sources-for-uk-us-local-businesses-104938 
Consistency: Keep in mind when filling these out, and phone number, as well as all other variables is extremely important. 

It can be a pain to fill these out, yelp, yellowpages, yahoo, bing, and merchant circle listing as soon as possible. These are the big ones.

**Organic Search:**
Title tags and Description tags: It amazes me how often companies will undervalue title tags and description tags. These are HUGE in ranking your website. Try it out

* **Keyword research:** While there are some really advanced keyword research tools out there that cost money

* **LinkBuilding:** There is no easy way to do linkbuilding, a couple easy ways to get links back to your website are writing articles on your topic and putting a link in them back to your site. You can submit these articles to sites like goarticles.com and ezinearticles.com. 


**EDIT** As **eightclicks** pointed out

Also, like reddit, make it so that all links are no follow... which basically means that you don't get credit for the link.

My business is seeking junior staff for out of school hour roles.  I decided to advertise this via our Facebook page. A classified ad costs about $140 to run for 2 days in our town

At the start of the campaign we had just over 1050 likes,000).

As of now we have 1296 and rising.  The post itself has attracted over 60 comments and 90 'LIKES'. Best part is 3 days in I still have over $40 left of that $100 I budgeted! On the actual job application side I have received over 50 applications from people that are tech savy and already interested in our business not just 'looking for anything' which I consider a great result

A bonus is that all these new likes are relevant and targeted people who are in our business demographic.

1370648695.0,1fwanf,How I made my commercial for free (here's my experience) - share your experience too.,TheCilician,17,3,7,"I'll just get right into it.

You have a business that sells a product (Physical product), it was time I made my own. My business after all had to do with hiking boots/bootlaces, so I was getting a lot (I meant atleast 5 every three-four days) about how to tie a hiker's knot, or a different more rugged knot for a pair of my laces....

So I set out to make a commercial. Simple, and seeing the process be more or less fun/ easy, I think I'll be making a couple more of these intructional commercials to add to my name, and help out my customers. 


Two of the things I used was. 

Camera - I used Nikon D700 with a 18-200mm lense. I borrowed this from my friend (it's become a pretty common camera after BestBuy started shelling them out for around $800). It's got fantastic video quality

Tripod - The person you're borrowing from, you can buy one for $50 off of craigslist. If you want to make more than one commercial, invest in a tripod. If you're not operating the camera, the person who is can be trusted to stabilize the camera more. And, in the event it's just you recording, you can set the camera at any height/angle to capture the instructional video shot. 


For the space

Basically I uploaded the video to YouTube, and a end credit slide. All this can be done in YouTube's video editing software (which you don't have to Download, or pay for. It's free with an account)

You're limited on the amount of scenes you can cut to

If you're interested in a different approach

It's a bit early for me to see the benefit of my commercial

1367451201.0,1dikh1,Was about to open a second location but my right hand guy quit. What would you do?,expandor,20,2,8,"I own a really busy stationary food truck that has been open for just over three years. I was going to open my second location this month but my right hand guy of two years quit after finding a job at a local brewery that he loves. 

I was going to let him run the already open one with a salary plus commission. I have three other employees but they don't show the motivation or dedication

I have a few options but can't decide on which is the best.

1. Wait to open #2. I'd hate to do this because we're pretty dead in the winter. I'd like to make as much as I can now. This would let me find someone better suited to run it and train them appropriately. I'll probably train the other employees on certain aspects of managing it as well incase the same thing happens. I'd prefer to train an existing employee

2. There's a lot across the street from my current truck that the owner will rent to me. I could start up another truck with different foods and different hours. The current truck is a breakfast truck (8a-2p). The new truck could be a lunch and dinner truck. Being so close

3. I own a few other trucks that I rent out. I do a rent to own deal with the ""tenants"" and they usually end up buying it. I could rent this one out. This would suck because I outfit my own trucks and really don't feel like building any more. And the income would be limited with no potential for earning more. 

Those are the only three that I could think of. What would you guys do?

I come from a service industry work history. (bartending)  I have little experience in entrepreneurship, the following reigns as my most pertinent concern. 

I'll try to succinctly include all relevant details of my circumstances:

I recently married and decided to find a more suitable career for my lifestyle.  After consideration

In order to startup my company
A work truck (6-7k$)
Roughly 2500$ in tools
Roughly 1500$ in administrative materials. (tablet computer, etc)

I have about 20k in student loan debt from an uncompleted degree. My credit is poor

A personal loan is out of the question

Considering my circumstances,000 in available credit on our current interest charging cards.

As a near worst case scenario, but optimistic projection would be total recouping within a year.  As a best case scenario, I would be able to recover the investment within 6 months.

Family might be an option, and I tend to agree.

I guess I'm looking for advice

Is it not wiser to finance the entire endeavor on a $10

I decided that in order to avoid security issues and the inconvenience of forcing them to call me on the phone to provide the CC details that I would try Google checkout's email invoice. Boy was that a mistake. Here's the story. Has anyone found this thing to be reliable? I can't believe they would survive long with the features I (don't) see.

1) On setup Google notifies me they will be holding payments for a while to make sure I'm on the up and up. Annoying but perhaps necessary I suppose. They have my bank details though and it's not like I haven't spent a freaking fortune on Adwords in the same account. 

2) Customer enters payment and checks out from link in email invoice. No notification is sent to me. No verification is sent to the customer. Nothing is sent anywhere.

3) I look into this when I get an irate email about not getting their product and/or a receipt. I figure they didn't hit enter or something (despite claiming they did).

Problems? 

- Google has apparently reset Checkout to be part of Google Wallet and entirely buyer oriented. Most of the links on each checkout page will redirect you to the consumer side and kick you out of your merchant account forcing you to log in. Looking for information you can't easily find? Don't click in the wrong place or it's back to logging in again.

- A forum full of people posting things like 'is anyone there' and 'I have serious issues with my account

- An email inquiry system which lets you send only preformatted click button select type inquiries. Don't have the transaction number because you didn't do a web transaction, that's last century. Presumably they use telepathy now.

Given my experience I could not possibly recommend Google checkout for any email invoice transaction. For web stores they may work fine (up until you have some issue) but for my needs they are a disaster.

All this

It was at this point that I made the decision to go into business for myself. I had the mindset that I would no longer allow someone to dictate what my financial future would be. Supporting my family is my responsibility and I will not work for anyone who could jeopardize that.

I started my own company providing residential warranty support for major fitness equipment manufactures as well as seeking out preventative maintenance contracts with Property management companies

In comes the offer from a big company who pretty much runs the other side of the state and is looking to expand to this coast. They now me from my work with the other company and I ran into them as I was scheduling for a training session with a major manufacturer who happens to use their facility as a training location. 

They offered me a small but reasonable base salary which included, a vehicle w/ gas card. And a standard commission plan which included a monthly draw to help off set my start up costs from starting my business. 

If I take it I feel like a coward for giving up what I am doing at the notion of steady cash with the opportunity to still operate as an entrepreneur and to go out and find more work to continue to grow the business. Its a good group of guys

Has anyone ever been in a similar situation?

Thanks Guys

EDIT: I need *ADVICE*
-This guys illiterate

EDIT: They shot down the notion of me subbing for them. Service head felt it wasn't in his best interest to pay to get me trained and certified on equipment that they have the luxury of being the only ones in the area to have certs on or the ability to certify on. The salary was increased 20% with stipends for home internet and mobile phone use as well as a 12 month employment contract and there is no non-compete clause involved in this.

My problem is this.. I am working as the Operations Manager for a small company (basically just the owner and myself) and our products have recently been picked up by a few distributors (used to only do direct online sales from our website) which is great. However we are finding that our products are now being offered on Amazon at a lower price than what we charge for them on our own site. Best guess is they are purchasing from the distributors near cost and squeezing us out of our own market. Insofar as I can tell the Amazon re-sellers are totally anonymous and I have no idea as to how to deal with them. (We approached the distributors and none of the customers they have open accounts with match the names of the Amazon re-sellers)

Little more story though....

**Question 1:**

What software do you use to track your business finances?

I'm about to (or think I am) become in charge of the finances of the small business I work for.  This job will include the following:

* Keeping track of all expenses

* Keeping track of all income

* Doing all invoicing to clients

* Goes along with expenses but keeping track of consultants pay 

I would like to be able to look at these numbers on a general basis and a job by job basis if the software allows me to.

Currently the numbers are kept on multiple excel spread sheets which I know you guys will scold me for

I have heard that Quicken is a good solution for this type of thing but I just wanted to see what everyone used and if there were other recommendations or any pitfalls of Quicken that people have seen.

**Question 2:**

Do you hire someone to go over your books with you and is it a necessity?

Do you do this just for taxes at the end of the year or do you do it throughout the year with an accountant or someone?

Do you think that the costs of this person pays for itself by savings, and allows you to focus on what you do for a living?

Any other thoughts, would be great as well.

Last month I set up a very large ecommerce site for $6, for a monthly income of about $8,500. Currently Im only making about half that, and Im overworked. I know I need to hire some people but heres the math :

$30K / yr for a sales person 

$30K / yr for an office person (Im starting to have trouble tracking all sorts of things

$30K for me (programmer)

Id have to get an actual office (my home office wouldnt suffice) so rent + utilities (add $12

Then add in insurance (I know very little about that),  (?) and just everything on top of that...

So it seems from my back of the napkin math and research I would need about $120K / yr in income to satisfy all the needs here and just break even. Currently Im working 65ish hours a week making just under $40K before taxes. 

So I have to make $120 a year and Im nearly completely tapped at $40K. I dont see any way to get any bigger than I am now

Rent. Software where landlords login and are able to:  
  
* Track issues at their estate (if a pipe is broken, tenants would have X amount of issues per month as to avoid abuse, extra issues would cost say, 25c/issue which goes to the landlord, or once max # of issues is used, they have the option of calling. Landlord can grant extra issues if the tenant already used theirs up legitimately (as in not raising issues for pointless shit)).  
* Track payments from tenants. Grant rent extensions to tenants for X days. Tenants can also report why they are late.  
* Automatically pay rent via your credit card or whatever other service.  
* The price of the software depends on # of tenants. For this I'd like to develop an algorithm to assess the monthly fee for the service so that it is a relatively uniform monthly sum for all landlords (be it small rental houses or large apartments/condos).

 I visited my accountant Saturday. I sat down at her desk and basically said that I needed to know exactly what I'm paying for. I told her to start with the personal return and explain like I'm 5. She started with ""Well next year yours will only be $125 because you'll just have a K1 and a W2. I asked what else I had this year that warranted the extra $300. She mumbled around a bit and tried to change the subject but I became stern and said ""Please

I moved on to the $825 corporate return and she said that it was because it was my first year in business and things needed to be filed with the state. I told her I had two objections. 1)My friend Brian started a new business at the same time I did, but I talk to her on my cell phone which is not recorded) and that I was going to check because I was pretty sure she told me $350 for the corporate return.

She became very pale and suddenly decided ""You know what? I think 
I'll just lower everything to $500"".

I've decided she was upset that I told her I was going to do my own bookkeeping and wanted to get money out of me.

So i've taken control of everything from our twitter account to our original gmail account we were using before we got our domain.  the only thing i wasn't able to recover and take ownership of was our domain which is kind of shitty but enabled me to use the domain name i wanted originally so that's cool.  i've contacted all of our vendors and informed them of the situation and we're good there.  one exceptionally shitty thing that has happened however is we've come to learn that he hasn't filled out of done any of our taxes since we opened.  it was a matter of chance that my wife called to see the status of everything and we came to learn that we were 3 days away from losing our liquor license and having a 75k lien against the brewery.  we've gotten extensions and are fixing it but it looks like my partner basically did some paperwork to get us legal and that was it. so he's completely neglected to fulfill his job duties which is good for us.

1347738998.0,zxtd4,I need to fire this employee and want to do it as smoothly as possible.,,18,4,35,"I have an employee who is late (upwards of several hours) without fail

This weekend

Now the tricky thing here is that it's not 100% her fault that she's late all the time. Her car continually breaks down, she often has to call in sick if one of them gets sick. I can sympathize, but on the other hand I simply can't afford to keep an employee who is this inconsistent about her attendance. 

Since my business employs under 20 people and I am in Tennessee, I have a feeling she's going to file for unemployment if I fire her and even though she won't win her claim (I've gone through this several times with previous employees), it's a huge hassle to have to go down to court and spend several hours there to resolve the matter.

1339357598.0,uuyzp,"PSA regarding business designations. (LLC's, S-corps, C-corps, partnerships, etc.)",15,"I see a lot of posts asking about what type of designation someone should use when forming their business

An LLC (limited liability company) is a state level designation. As of 1997, including different kinds of corporations (close corporation, foreign corporation, professional corporation, etc), limited partnership, limited liability limited partnership, and general proprietorship. You can go here to select your state and see what state level designations are available and how they work: http://www.sba.gov/content/incorporating-your-business

Side note (not sure if this applies to all states): Sole proprietorships and general partnerships do not need to file forms with their state unless doing business under a different name than their own ""true name"". Then you must file with the state as a fictitious name registration

You'll notice that C corporation and S corporation were not listed above as a state designation. That is because these are federal level tax classifications. Anyone forming an LLC must then classify their business as a sole proprietorship, or C corporation for federal tax purposes. (Note: a single member LLC can not be a partnership, and a multi-member LLC can not be a sole proprietorship)

All of these federal classifications except for C corporation, and instead show directly on the member(s) personal taxes. One of the differences between an S corporation and a partnership is that with an S corporation there is no flexibility in how profits and losses are split between the members.

Most small businesses and start-ups are best off forming an LLC and then classifying as a sole proprietorship or partnerships (depending on number of members) for federal taxes. This allows the member(s) more protection from debts and other liabilities that the business may incur

1374519031.0,1itvcx,How do I expand what my business can offer the customer effectively?,rsteele1981,12,3,13,"My wife and I own/operate a lan gaming center in Augusta

I started repairing consoles after our first 6 months in business. Sometimes the repair side is more profitable than the LAN center side. So in that same vein I have spoke to a guy I know that is interested in doing phone and tablet screen replacements. We're working out the pricing, PC repair, and anything else electronic that we can work on. I've already replaced circuit boards and other parts in things like BOSE radio's. Most of the time it's a matter of having the parts available and the tools required to take the electronic apart.

The tricky part is that there are already many PC repair shops in our city. TV repair is a little harder to come by

I'm taking on a lot of responsibilities at once because I want to use our existing customer base to expand to all of these new repair options rather quickly. It's a matter of finding a dependable person to handle the repairs and being sure that they make enough plus the business making enough to justify these new services we plan to offer.

I'm hoping to set up an online comic store later this year

I was hoping that maybe people that had set up their own stores would have some advice to share to someone setting up their first business. I'm based in Lonon

Would it better to build the site from scratch or use an e-commerce package provided by a company? 

What do you use to market your company? I've set up a facebook page and twitter for when I go live. What other means do you use? 

Is it difficult to obtain a merchant account from a bank to accept debit/credit card payments? 

These are all the questions I can think of so on the spot. If there's anything else you feel like sharing please do.

Advice please!",fadingfastsd,13,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1ac9s3/2_years_full_time_into_a_motorcycle_parts/, but right now I've got alot on my mind and could really use some advice and opinions from a new point of view.

Now for some background to begin with. I'm 30, customizing, building, restoring, etc), and I wanted a way to combine my education and enjoyment/interest in electronics with my passion. After pushing hard for a job at a motorcycle electrical component manufacturer for almost a year, I was hired to run their R&amp;D department. This consisted of designing motorcycle charging system components, as well as quality control.  Despite a paycut, myself and  a coworker from the previous company decided to start a new business.

We began our business in February 2011.  I'm not mentioning the name of the business now, and various independent consulting work (motorcycle wiring harness design jobs, usually documenting the wiring for existing products for some other small businesses).  I have taken very little money from this business (less than $3,000 in 2 years), and for the last 8 months, absolutely nothing. I work full time, well over 8 hours per day on this business, I can't strangle the business by pulling money from it.

Being an Engineer by training and education, overseas production, website sales, and technical support.  We design our parts here in USA, prototype them, and test them to iron out new designs. We then have the parts built in large quantity overseas and import them. We warehouse and retail them ourselves.  The margin is very good and high on our parts.

We achieved about $50k in sales our first year, phone orders from customers, and our dealers (dealers get a discount on parts to sell to their customers...40% off retail which is the best margin in the business).  

I'm trying not to ramble too much here

Our business requires a great deal of cash flow. While our parts are very cheap per item to manufacture, we will not be able to afford our next production run in a couple months. It requires always planning and juggling money for new production.

I feel like overall I just can't get ahead. We are always afloat, how can I keep this up? I can't bear the thought of walking away from something I've put my heart, soul, and life into for the last 2 years. The business is solid, there is not a huge amount of competition, and it is something I am very good at. However, I just can't seem to grow it large enough to support me financially. It gets very discouraging to work so hard yet be so broke.  While overall, without being able to be financially secure, as I have taken 2 loans from family to grow the business (totaling $25k) and I cannot rest until they are paid back in full with interest (agreed upon payment at very low %

To sum up this rambling mess, I can't seem to increase retail sales enough to get us to the next level. We don't currently stock a wide enough range of parts for larger distributors to pick us up (which would result in large orders, which we need), forcing us to focus on retail sales ourself, which are costly (advertising) and time consuming.  I have this nagging feeling that I am always missing something, just out of my site or grasp, that is extremely obvious and would result in the growth we need to turn the corner.  I currently have in stock a retail price of inventory worth over $100k, yet I don't know how I will manage that as I currently work full time.

#1. A Good Story.

The first item sounds obvious, how they improved the business over time, challenges along the way, motivation for selling.

As for #2, has offered some convenient tools over the years to measure and share business data. If you are the least bit hesitant about sharing your information with third parties (worried about unscrupulous keyword miners, for instance), get an NDA signed up front.

Often, which supports their growth story. Be up front about traffic anomalies - there are dozens, if not hundreds of ways for potential buyers to sneak a peek at any Panda or Penguin penalties your site may have incurred, even without direct access to your analytics.

If a company uses AdWords, though. Competitors can gain powerful strategic knowledge about your marketing this way.

#On Earnings:
Some practical advice for those getting started: separate your business accounts from your personal from the beginning, and it can be difficult if not downright impossible to separate accounts them. Paypal can be especially thorny in this regard.

For those of you with multiple income sources

General advice on flipping services: There are a few sites that specializing in selling online properties (businesses, but there's plenty of dross to get through, both for buyers and sellers. In theory, they are trying to add legitimacy to an online marketplace with user ratings and feedback, and the semblance of safety. In practice, they accomplish none of this in a meaningful way. User accounts come and go, they use some minor bit of cookie / IP association that attempts to flag users running duplicate accounts, but wading through the mess is time consuming.

Online business brokerages have been a mixed bag - they often charge sellers a hefty premium (10-15% or more of purchase price) for their services. Compare this against the 6% considered the national norm for selling a house

1340643027.0,vkumq,Some thoughts from my experience,remarkless,18,7,30,"I'm currently watching the company I'm working for sinking to its death. Its a small business

A few of my observations:

* Don't fight your employees. 

Your employees are there to help you. Yes, take it into consideration.

&gt; Just recently I made up some photo books of our work to give to local venues that we have good relationships with. They're a good sales tool. Then mr. signs-the-checks walks in and insists certain pictures need to be included. Pictures that are scanned in from early 2000's pictures, but finally he just played his ""I sign the paychecks"" bullshit. So now I have several photo books with horribly crappy images in them, which will certainly detract from the presentation overall.




* Trust your employees

My employer has major trust issues, you'll never have a wonderfully successful business. Have some faith in your employees, have some faith that they're not all out to screw you over. Dedicated employees will work hard for you. Manage them, but don't constantly micromanage. Give them freedom. Let them bring their ideas to the table. 




* Let go

You have two options. Work yourself to death and do everything yourself, you'll always have menial tasks to do, but delegate what you can and manage those that you do give them to.

&gt; My boss often walks in and screams something along the lines of ""WELL I CAN'T DO IT ALL!"" when something goes wrong. He's right, because he won't delegate out tasks. If he had let someone else review the order or make the reservation, maybe they would have seen the conflict, but since he's constantly in over his head, he misses things like that. 



* Allow freedom of thoughts

You're not the only person who knows anything. Be open to suggestions from your employees. They're on the front line. They're in the trenches. They're getting to know your company and likely have good suggestions. Being open to suggestions doesn't mean you have to initiate them, understand and take them into consideration.

&gt; I came into this job with 100s of ideas to grow the company. Every single one was shot down. ""Too much work"" ""That will never work"" ""No."" Everything I suggested

We found out the building we want is available and we're throwing 2/3rds of my retirement money into it. We know we can make it work with my son running the front office -- accounting, A/R, A/P, inventory tracking, etc..., his best friend and my ""son from another bun"" doing the sales, deliveries and foot work, follow ups and filing part time. I'll be doing the powder coating

I'm tired of teaching other businesses how to be efficient and productive, with my boy.

Wish us luck.

edit: We'll be using the Quickbooks 2011 Premier for accounting on a Proliant ML350 G6 quadcore with 16 gig ram, the name of which is registered already. We will use a lot of social networking, which my son is better at than I am, advertising in the local newspaper, trade shows, mass e-mails twice per month to manufacturers and other prospective clients from an easy opt-out mailing list our sales person is already putting together. 

The company is a subsidiary of the parent company I created when I became a consultant and was set up with the help of my CPA, according to FICO.

The building is 4, the computer room, storage room and two bathrooms, plus the 3,000 square feet of 4"" reinforced concrete floor for the work area and is wired for 240 and 480v. 

Rent on the building is $1100/mo, like a signage out front, business cards, desks, file cabinets and display samples. When the company I worked for went belly up, I purchased 48 computers from the bank, including software licenses, routers and video surveillance systems for $400 so our offices will be fine. (They were not I.T. people and had no idea how much I laughed inside when I negotiated the price with their representative) 

My skill set includes 10 years of I.T., five years as a master carpenter and thermoplastics welder (where I first started powder coating), newspaper editor, combat engineer with the Army, education as a geek with New Horizon and the community college, theology and journalism degrees, management training

Their problem? They're barely making anything

It sucks, because being 19 and in college, I can't *always* be there, and they can't afford to hire any more employees. (currently only *three*, two college girls and one older woman)  My mother and father work *by themselves* on tuesdays and thursdays until I get home from school, then I help them close. They bust their asses off with barely anything to show for it

They sell close to 50 lbs of chicken salad a week. It was

Their catering end, doesn't get much business. *Maybe* once a month they'll get a job. They don't have anything scheduled until December 3rd. They get rave reviews from their food. 

They don't advertise. And it hurts them. They have a great product

I recently convinced them to let me use Intuit to begin making their website

I ask you, if there's any cheap yet effective ways to advertise or get their name out there.

I understand that property comes with taxes, building and land is considerably less than what someone is paying on a much smaller space. Is it reasonable to look at building something bigger and renting out the extra spaces to tenants rather than paying high rent to some one else?

Anyone know of a project that lends to very small businesses with a solid repayment program and transparent and fair terms?

Ideally I'd like to donate to the following:

The Recipients:

1. VERY small businesses (scrappy individuals that just need a start)

2. Individuals who have a solid plan of action for the money (other than ""for inventory and overhead""). Essentially

3. Business model has some plausible chance of making it

The System:

1. Interest is paid directly to the lenders

2. System maintains a transparent list of where borrowers are on their payments

3. System offers a list of businesses to choose from with the reasons for the loans

4. System can demonstrate success stories for their borrowers

Yesterday evening I was a little hungry and my stomach was asking for something sweet. So I went to the new bakery that opened two weeks ago just across the street. They had tons of applie pie

When I ordered them, ok?"". ""Ok"", I answered, although I wasn't that hungry. ""One donut is 0.90€ and two or three donuts cost 1.50€"", the shopkeeper repeated. When I went back home I couldn't stop wondering whether such a ""three for two"" strategy was really appropiate for that new bakery. Shouldn't they sell two donuts at, let's say, 1.30€ and three at 1.50€?

I suppose you all know ""TheEconomist"", while the suscription to the online version cost 120€. And there was also a third option: the subscription to the print and online version also cost 120€. So what was the sense of the second option (online version only)? Who would prefer it over the third option? Most probably... nobody. Most likely, the second one was a kind of a benchmark for the other two and it made the third option look less expensive.

I guess the new bakery from my neighbourhood tries to apply the same sales strategy: three donuts may seem less expensive if they cost the same as two. I'd say it's a good idea as many people will end up buying three donuts instead of one. Nevertheless there may be one hitch: some people may want to eat only two donuts and not three

I am part owner along with both of my parents, we have a system that the old owners implemented titled 'Keystroke POS'. A fitting name as it is most definitely a Piece Of Shit. Not a day goes by that we discover errors for inventory, orders, prices, etc which is blamed on the program. It is most likely due to the program being almost 15 years old. It is extremely clunky and slow, has a terrible UI, and is generally a pain to do any simple task. Most actions that should take maybe two or three clicks, entering a new product into the system takes about 5 minutes per item

My problem, it will be much simpler and cheaper (this is not a false statement). However, Keystroke has the worst customer service in the world and I do not plan on keeping their software. Neither have I been able to find any good reviews or experience on the internet regarding their software.

 I have looked into the basic Quickbooks POS and was not impressed whatsoever. I have done research many times over the past two years on and off and never came to any conclusion on what will be worth our money. I ask you fellow reddit business owners: What do you use?

TL;DR: Our small business needs a new Point of Sale system

Edit:
Forgot to mention: Our second store which we recently purchased has no computer system. They do everything by hand which takes an agonizing amount of time to check in, etc. Whichever system we decide to go with, we will implement into that store.

Basics are:  
Opened in Oct 2012  
Invested $18
Food biz with e-commerce website. Order online
Food is perishable, short shelf life  
I have no brick and mortar  
My niche is BOOMING &amp; attracted big players (think Starbucks type)  
I have no employees. I make it myself with 2 family members. None of us are paid  
I have independent contractor delivery drivers  
Since Oct 2012
Assets include, packaging, registered trademark, recipes, solid reputation online (reviews)  
Dollar value of equipment+inventory is $37k  
Debt is $5k on credit cards (still paying off equip)  

I can't afford to open a brick and mortar and feel that is the next logical step to grow the business. Competition in this niche is FIERCE. Think cup cake crazy of 2008ish. The market is new but over-saturated with competitors with $ to spend on opening multiple locations in 2013 and tons of ads.

The cons (to a buyer) with selling that I see are that sales are low (right?), biz is in its infancy, if they do their homework they'll realize how over-saturated it is.

**Official Reddit definition of spam:** The official Reddit definition of posting spam is ""Submitting only links to your blog or personal website"" or repeated posts to multiple subreddits.  It's really the only hard guideline we have and it's probably best that we operate within it. The question is if other guidelines would improve or detract from the value of /r/smallbusiness.

**Why do they spam:** Usually spam is about either making money from the reader or improving web presence though manipulating search engines. Since the cost of posting is essentially zero a post that makes even a nickel is worth doing and if it's worth doing once it's worth doing a thousand times (and probably worth it to a thousand different people).

**Why ban any spam, SEO offerings and links to ad farms. Personally as a small business owner I'm spammed continuously with telecommunications offers, cash advance schemes, health insurance programs and questionable value certifications/training as well.

So I invited to join to two unemployed friends that are very talkative and I suspected they could be good salesmans. This was a few months ago.
And so was it that they got some clients and we start making money. At the beginning I told them that each one would earn for what they do. So if they get a client that needs a computer repaired and they get the client and repair the computer

The idea was to do something and have everyone happy. The thing is they already learn the basics of the business and I feel they will leave me aside as they will sell and do everything by themself

I'm worried and want to change the rules. I have this whole idea for the business, make the webpage, logo, business card for everyone, panflets for clients, etc. I'm also the one they have to resort when dificult troubles arrise, as I'm the geek in the group.
I have a very good relationship with them and they are not trying to kick me out

I'm looking for a system that will allow us to track, no other bells and whistles for now.  The catch is we are a buy and resell business.  We have no stock, and we have no internal product number system (we can't, our suppliers have so many products and we do not have access to all the product numbers)  So a system that requires us to enter our products in to a database first, in order to be able to enter them on a PQ or PO is useless.

Maybe you know of something that can do this...

Firstly: I'd like this to me PHP/MySql based so that it can be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection.

We need a system that for price quotes:

1. Allows our sales people to login.
2. Creates a price quote (that will be saved in the DB)
3. The price quote would contain the following searchable fields, customers phone/fax etc., the date, the quote number, the product number, descriptions of item.  

The system would need to take the input and generate a PDF.  This PDF would be downloadable.

Some points that have prevented us from using other systems...

1. Our product numbers are very different and we do not have any inventory (think of it as infinite).  We must be able to enter any product number at the time we are creating the price quote.
2. We do not collect tax

For our purchase Orders:


1. Our sales person(s) is able to login.
2. Creates a PO.
3. The PO must contain the following searchable fields, the date, the manufacturer (our supplier), the customer location, my companies sales person name, product numbers, descriptions.  




Notes: 

1. We must also be able to edit the FOB Factory field, pricing validity length.  These hardly ever change but they sometimes do.  We will also need to be able to edit the ""Please address to ..."" line as sometimes we need PO made out directly to our factories and not to us.
2. If search could be exportable to CSV
3. The system must keep a record of every PQ, and delete them.
4. The PO entry should not depend on their being a correlating PQ.


Any ideas? Have questions?  I probably left details out, and be able to calculate more accurately our best selling items if we went digital.

1366771151.0,1czf2l,Greatly in need of some help- Sale of a business.,bemusedfuse,9,1,6,"I recently came to this board for advice on finding a buyer

 It all started at the time of signing a purchase agreement. We had decided against retaining a broker, because it offered us a clean break after all was said and done.  We wrote up the purchase agreement, and %10 of the purchase price was nestled away in escrow, all under the contingency that the buyer could obtain a lease.  Nearly two months later and he's still negotiating a lease, and we're at a loss of what to do.

The first 2 weeks were at a standstill due to our landlord being out of town.  The next 2 weeks were spent waiting for the landlords counter offer.  The last 3 weeks have simply been us giving him the benefit of the doubt. He's explained that he's under pressure from his investor to obtain a more lucrative lease. It's 8 days till our final ultimatum and I really don't want to screw this up

I could just stick it out for another week but the buyer is a complete monster.  He does not wear underwear, it doesn't work like that bro.  I can't take it anymore.

My worst fear is that doing training before closing was a mistake, in lieu of the escrow money?  I feel that my only option is to stop anymore training until I see a lease, is this immoral business etiquette?

I've contacted a few of my old coworkers and we're interested in reopening it and adding some things to the menu (juice

I'm in the process of putting together a business plan, permits, tax registration, etc.

A few questions I had

1.  How should I structure the company regarding the other five ""partners"". The idea, but we've been developing and tweaking the idea together for a few weeks. Obviously it isn't practical or logical to assume a five-way equal profit-loss share, but they'll all be working in the store and rather than start with five part time employees it would be easier financially and legally if they were part owners. Can I start them out as ""probationary"" owners and pay them in company shares for a set number of time until they own a certain percentage, then once they reach that percentage (5-10%?) start paying them hourly wage along with a small portion of profits? Like an LLC? Or should I set up a sole proprietorship? I'm not too familiar with company structures. Any recommendations?

2.  I'll need to get a loan from the bank. I've talked to someone that is willing to put up ~$50K collateral on a loan once they see my business plan. What type of loan should I get and what do I need to get it? I've heard the amount of paperwork to get an SBA loan is astronomical and I should pursue a personal loan if I can get it. Knowing I have excellent credit and $50k collateral

3. I've done a lot of market research on the demographics in the area where we're opening

4. How long should a business plan be? I can go into thirty pages of detail on the demographic, location, food costs, etc. but is that too long? Should I create a condensed version or powerpoint and provide everything else as needed? I've seen business plans that are anywhere from 10-50 pages long and there doesn't seem to be a general consensus on which format is the best.

5. We plan on filing to legally protect the idea, color scheme, etc. but more so the underlying theme and basic idea of the restaurant.

Someone told me that if my client defaults on his taxes then the IRS can go after me for the money he owes.  Unfortunately I think my client is in a situation where this may happen.  I can see why they would have a law in place to do this since it prevents people from shuffling money through shell companies to avoid taxes but my question is would they apply this regardless or do they apply some common sense to it?  Is there a provision to protect someone who was legitimately doing contract work?

1349404293.0,10z13h,How much does advertising help? ,outofcontextcomment,8,0,11,"I talked a little bit about my dad's business on another post but I will share some basic info again for those who didn't see the first post. 

My dad owns a retail business selling tile and all sorts of flooring and home/kitchen/bath remodeling products from setting material, and etc etc. We are located in Southern California and our industry has been crushed by the housing market crash and recession. We used to have several branches and properties but we are now down to our main showroom and our warehouse. Our showroom is in a high traffic area, referred to as ""tile mile"" in Anaheim, it is an area where 3 out of 4 buildings are occupied by tile stores. So even without advertising we get a pretty high volume of foot traffic, especially on the weekends. On top of that, our company has been in business for close to 20 years so we have a lot of repeat customers. We also have another branch in Downey which is a bit south of downtown Los Angeles but that store gets 0 walk in customers. When I say zero, I literally mean zero. It's located on a very busy street right near the freeway

Our company has advertised before, they haven't advertised. I'm wondering how much advertising could possibly help. Our industry is struggling, but there are always going to be people fixing their homes. Even though we are struggling, we see a pretty decent number of people coming to our store. I see two solutions, 
A) either get a higher percentage of the people already coming to our store to give us their business
B) increase the number of people coming to our store so that even if a low % of people are buying

I've brought this up with my dad many times but I haven't pushed the issue because I'm not convinced it will have an impact. But my dad doesn't seem to think advertising is an issue / it won't make much of an impact. His reasoning is 

A) if you google us we already come up (although this is if you type in our name

B) if we advertise our store

I have no idea who is right

I'm working on a website to start with so that we have somewhere to direct our customers

**EDIT**: I really appreciate your responses. I'm going to call him today and ask him to come back and give me 5 modern $20s. Thanks for being gentle.  A little back story: I met this guy at a business networking event

**Edit** Called him

**Edit** I made the first call around 8:45 this morning.  No response. I made a second call at 11:30. No response yet. 

**Edit** In case anyone is still here and curious, thats the only way vendors can judge it. 

Basically that's all I needed to know.  I left and went to the shop to call him again, and god forbid it gets taken away from me because it's so old and comes up counterfeit. I told her I needed him to come in and exchange it for more modern bills either today or tomorrow. She said sure and she'd have him call me. Now I wait.

**Final Update**
    I emailed him on Friday evening stating the events: What he said to me when he gave me the money, avoiding and not returning calls is no way to treat a fellow small business owner, and it is not right that he give and expect me to use money with so many ""rules"" on it.  I ended with ""Meet me at my place of business by Monday 5:00pm or I will take this matter to the authorities"".  Guess who immediately emailed me back.  After a couple go-rounds and excuses including ""Use the money like any other money"" and he's ""bed-ridden with a health issue"" and ""Now I'm at the hospital"", as well as telling me to come to his house, I just stuck to my guns and kept repeating Monday by 5:00pm.  Well, yesterday morning he emailed me saying he could meet me to exchange the money. I brought my fiance and met him at a coffee shop to exchange it. He was all apologies and said he had a back injury that made him honery on the emails and he was sorry for the hassle. He then volunteered that he had ""several hundred thousand"" dollars worth of this old money he's been ""trying to run through the system"".  Well, whatever

I don't have a good branding yet, that was selled to other guy. In a fresher way using a bit of classical elements but kind of hipster styling it.

Internal problems such as stealing, but we had some legal problems in the past with employees and we are allways afraid of firing.

And if other people have similiar business i would like to have some help by links or restaurants.

Personal problems:

-I did not hire that staff
-The strategy was not mine
-The clients were not acquired by me
-It's not a cash problem is more of puting my Marketing vision and try to turn the place into a big business and building a big brand.

So far my managing strategy towards employees is a positive approach, as well as hating(getting extremely pissed) about losing money by any means.

I really liked this idea.  There are some items that I would do differently than what my friend did.  The largest of them being room for table-top games.  Games like [Magic: the Gathering](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Default.aspx).  Board games like [Cosmic Encounters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_Encounter).

The problem is, as in needing to keep the newest/coolest games on the shelf would get really expensive at $60 each.  On the tabletop side, there isn't much worry beside how to get in touch with a distributor.

On May 8th we had a customer from a theatre in Monarch Beach


They said they couldn't pay it all at once and wanted to do payments.  I requested a deposit of $700 CAD.
We received a deposit of $500 CAD on May 29th.


We shipped the order on June 5th. They received it June 7th along with an invoice we sent for the remaining amount due.

They acknowledged receiving the costume items and have used them. The show is now over


Along with that invoice sent on June 7th

30 days has passed and we've not received a payment.


We have called and left voice messages last week to remind of them of the upcoming due date. We've left voice messages this week asking for them to contact us to work out a payment.  We have not received a response. We've sent emails to the owner (the person we've been working with)


The phone number for the owner usually rings several times and goes to voice mail.  The phone number for the theatre's main line from their site likely has a full mailbox since it rings and then asks for a security code... 


We've sent a payment request via PayPal for the $850 to the same email address we've received the deposit from.


I'll likely give them a few more days, gave them a discount, airbrushed 70+ pieces, we even provided some free airbrushing on pieces...


So should they not come through this week

Should we continue to wait?  Should we start posting their info and non-payment status to various theatre forums,  travelling isn't worthwhile when it'll cost more to travel than the debt owing.

The company I work for is working on selling off what I perceive the most financially stable and profitable portion of it's business. The company I work for has been in business over 33 years and changed ownership 18 months ago. The new owner is wanting to try and revive a failing section of the business and is planning to use this transaction to try and breathe new life into this piece of the business. My personal opinion is he'll be throwing his money into a moneypit and is making a bad business decision

In any case, I've been here 11 years). *MY* reason for including him in this transaction is he's the one that redeveloped this product and he is the most knowledgable about how it works under the hood. What I would bring to the table is supporting the environment from outside of the software application world and pushing on more modern forms of delivery and pursuing possible new markets. All that being said, between my father in law and myself, we have all the knowledge necesarry to keep the system running.

My father in law profile: 60+ years old and owned a business before. His business was successful in its time

Me: Mid 30's. I've been at the company I'm at now since getting out of college and I have a Master's degree. While I have a very good credit score

One of the nice things about the possibility of purchasing this business is that I would not need to quit the job I'm working at now. It's very low maintenance and the parts of it that require regular business hours worked can be paid for with service contracts back to my existing employer as part of the negotiation would be an agreement for this work with my existing employer. It would be easy for me

Some numbers:
Annual GROSS revenue: ~ $400
Annual expenses: ~ $150

Asking price: $1, but the owner is willing to consider $500,000 up front and the remaining sum to be paid over the course of some period of time (~3 years? I don't know yet)

I know the owner has an offer on the table

I *DO NOT* have these funds

My return policy is pretty strict: Up to 3 business days with tags attached and original receipt for a full refund. Up to 7 days for exchanges/store credit. I know it's pretty strict but I was having a lot of troubles with a couple ladies that were taking advantage of my previous return policy.

  Today a girl and her friend came in. The customer wanted to return a skirt but she didn't have (lost) her receipt. She gave me her card so I could look it up. No problem, she bought the skirt on March 3rd. It also reeked of marijuana and was missing the belt. I told her because it's been over 3 months I could not issue a refund. They started to hassle me and ask for store credit, I told her per my policy you only have up to 7 days to be issued store credit. Then they ask for half the cost of the skirt in store credit. I  stayed firm. Her friend comes over and says ""that doesn't make sense. We are planning to buy something and we can just get half store credit toward the item and you can resell the skirt for full profit"". I told her I couldn't because it was missing the belt and they freaked out! Telling me it didn't come with a belt and she never received it. I told her it did, there are belt loops and I know all my products (my space is less than 200 sq ft.!) The friend puts all the items she was holding back and says ""Let's just go to another store!!"" and they storm out.

  Now I'm afraid they're going to write bad reviews and just trash my shop in general. I do have a Yelp page but there are only 2 reviews.. and I know how damaging bad reviews can be.  What would you have done in this situation? Can she call her credit card company to try and issue a charge back?

I am a couple of weeks away from opening my restaurant

Background story:

I'm a young IT \ Video Editor \ Animator (so I have a good+ understanding of digital tools) who fell in love and moved to a different continent and changed my career path. In the past 3 years I've been working on opening a food business ('Hummusiyah', many returns, and although my turnaround is tiny I think the product is good and has a spot in the local market, which is devoid of hummus (we mainly have here pizza, noodles, doener-shawarma and sausages [bonus points: guess where I am]).

Finally after a long search I've found a suitable place and hopefully I'll sign the lease on Friday. So far I've invested 10k Euro

The location I found is very central and is adjacent to a very frequented plaza (considered A1 class) but I'm getting it for cheap because the place will be demolished in 13 months and I'll have to leave. I need to use this time (and the coming summer especially) to build recognition and generate enough money to be able to get some loan to open the second

Marketing and promotions:

I have built a [website](http://www.thehummuscorner.com/) and have a [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Hummus-Corner/195632157139473) (which is getting less and less hits unless I pay them). 

I need to come up with ideas on how to promote my soon-to-open shop. 

* Flyers: Tried it once

* Having attractive young people handing out samples: People react positively and when distributed in the right time (a little before lunch) and in the area of my place

* I think of making small '1 Euro' notes that people could redeem (one per customer on opening week only not including drinks). This is basically a coupon

* I will have a 'crowd stoppers' - one of these street signs that stand outside the shop with a poster describing what's in the shop.

A single entity of the proper type can provide tax advantages

But next time you're at Arby's, and licenses it back to another Arby's-owned entity (e.g. a management company). There are likely other entities serving various business purposes as well.

So why would they do this? Well

You're able to enhance the balance sheets of one of your companies (all with absolutely audit-able transactions

You can create rock-solid asset protection against litigation and regulatory expenses by creating isolation between your operating entities and those which hold assets.

You can maximize your tax advantages by structuring each entity to receive the maximum benefits available under the tax code. 

You will begin to recognize new income streams using existing resources and assets

The possibilities are absolutely staggering when you start to see this structure unfold before you.

Now, or you need a team of pros who can do so on your behalf. You don't want to be on the wrong end of an audit because you did something stupid that you can't justify at the end of your tax year.

If this is something that interests anyone here, you'll know exactly how multiple entity structuring works, and you'd be able to theoretically go implement it for yourself. It's going to be very educational in nature, and it's going to be free.

That said, we can work with you to implement the strategies using our tools and support. But there's no pressure, and no obligation. We do think this is the best thing since sliced bread for business, and that's why we're willing to completely show our hand, because we think once you see how easy we make it, you'll trust us to help you implement it.

2.  What am I really buying if the place is not currently operating.  Just the existing lease (about 6.5 years left on it) and the equipment and signage?

3.  If the location is great in a general sense but not great in a more specific sense, very busy commuter traffic in the evening which would be good for take out (small interior so this would be a focus) but, it is at a weird intersection and sits on a triangular lot that can be awkward to navigate.  Am I being falsely sold on location here? 

4.  How much does a lighted custom plastic sign cost?  I hate the existing name but it looks like they sunk some real money into the sign.  It is multi colored


The price seems too good to be true (it has dropped by almost half since I first contacted the business broker) but after thinking about it



**reasons I think this place could work:**

A. tons of commuter traffic and I have a friend in the area who always complains about the lack of quality take out on that route.  This place's food and name are what I think was sinking it more than anything.

B.  I grew up eating arguably the best take out burgers in the country and I have been working at home to duplicate it for years and I feel i'm getting close.

C.  With a simplified menu and faster turnaround times

D. not using a shitty

Start a business – not a startup. The goal is profit.  Know how you will become profitable from the start.

 Decisions are progress. So say “let’s decide on it” instead of “let’s think about it.”

 Focus on things that stay constant. Like peoples’ desires.  Focus on ease of use

Always sell the byproduct.  Rework is the byproduct of 37 Signal’s blog.  If you are spending time becoming an expert at something, or music tour) you should be documenting it.

1331256922.0,qo7r7,Successful Small Family Owned Business with 40 year history having trouble growing (canada),actasifyouare,9,2,12,"I am the second generation of the family to be working in our business. I came into it five years ago after wasting a pile of money going to university for a degree that went nowhere. 

My father started this business in 1971. He has been through it all and has managed quite successfully to provide a good life (by no means rolling in dough but good) Aside from a hickup in the 1980's when interest rates went through the roof (akin to buying a property on your visa card) we have weathered most storms and swings.  

In 2006 I came into the business. We are a retail and wholesale operation that works in high end high quality european outdoor gear and lifestyle clothing. Being a younger generation I have always pushed for modernization

The Canadian Outdoor equipment market is one that is very unique and slanted to favor the big players. There are now only two very large players (namely Mountain Equipment Co-op and Canadian Tire which recently acquired the Forzani Group - see Sport Check

Now here lies our problem. We are hitting a glass ceiling when it comes to financing. Year over year we put up solid numbers but our financing has not increased by our primary lender in close to ten years. They have no interest in changing anything unless we show them assets (aka a house etc) or put cash into the bank. Now why would I put cash into the bank to pay to use my own money? We bank with one of the big banks in Canada and of course that has shown little to no help or interest in working us to fund any sort of growth. They have suggested going to an advance company where we sell X amount of our credit card transactions to them. This is of course expensive money but if you take it over the life of a loan it really would be pretty close to a 4-5 year loan in terms of interest expenses. This did help us but again it is only a band-aid that keeps us away from getting to the rolling income that would fund our growth.

As our main product line from europe is imported directly cash is king. Our supplier has worked with us on reasonable terms but getting in a big enough order and ensuring turnover is quick enough has really held us back. We both have strong sales with Government/Law Enforcement agencies as well as a strong following across Canada and the USA with everyday consumers. We figure that due to our lack of funding at present we see $20-40000 worth of revenue walk out of the door every single month. Add in we have anywhere from 80-100k worth of sales on backorder at any given time.   

What I am looking for is advice on getting funding to grow. The revenue and opportunity is there. The potential for growth is almost limitless and the foundation is solid. It's like looking through a glass ceiling and it is getting frustrating. I am interested in advice on seeking funding and/or non-traditional methods of funding. Ideally we would be looking for 100-150k of additional funding. As of right now we do $900k in sales at retail and about $200k at wholesale. We typically run about 40% GP and with our new product range it is getting closer to 45+% (can be as high as 50% some months depending on the clothing/footwear ratio)

The TLDR

-40 year old family company about to be taken over by second gen.
-Good following and sales across the continent from single location
-potential for growth limitless due to exclusivity of lines and support from manufacturers
-looking for financing since banks typically are not interested
-looking for 100-150k in additional financing
-loosing 20-40k in sales per month due to insufficient supply that is limited by financing/cashflow
-typically have 80-100k retail in sales on backorder again due to supply issues
-Revenues sit at ~$1.1 million
-looking for non-traditional means of financing since big banks won't help

Any advice or input is greatly appreciated! It really is a great business that focuses on good quality long lasting product that uses a lot of sustainable materials and the following is amazing and our support from our customers is second to none.

Hey everyone, and Paychex and ultimately decided on Intuit), and I'm not sure which state I should file my employment related taxes with, as the company is purely virtual and legally somewhat complicated.

**Background**
When starting the LLC, so here's how it stands now:

I am the sole member of a Wyoming LLC, so I established my parents' address in Kansas as both the Mailing Address and Principal Office Address with the Wyoming Secretary of State.  The Kansas address is also the address filed with the IRS for the company's EIN.

I now live in Oregon, etc.) so that I can actually retrieve the mail.  I intend in the future to pay contractors in various states, perhaps even countries.  Within months, I intend to pay a contractor in Washington.

**Recap**
So, mailing address in Oregon, employee in Oregon, contractor in Washington.  Whew!

**Conundrum**
So the question Intuit asks is: *""Where is your office located?""*  Intuit uses this answer to determine which state I pay employment taxes to, or any other registrations other than my Wyoming LLC Articles of Organization.  All of my sales are through the Apple App Store and similar distributors who handle all of the payments, taxes, and processing for me.  

If I enter in the Kansas address, and the business isn't registered there either.  I don't think it should be Oregon either since I'll pay Oregon income taxes as an employee living here, but the company has no official presence in Oregon either, other than having an employee (myself) who works from Oregon.  I think this will be the same case for my contractor: as far as I can tell I don't need to pay state employer taxes to Washington in order to hire a contractor there.  

My best guess is that I should list the Wyoming address and pay unemployment, since that's where the LLC is registered, but I'm still not sure.

I'm sure I'll likely have to consult a lawyer and/or accountant about this,,False,self,t5_2qr34,False,,True

The idea I have has been done but

There are plenty of reasonably priced SaaS applications that can automate this process but there's a small learning curve involved. The systems I've seen use one of three methods for automatically evaluating a candidate: 1) the existence of keywords in their resume

I know the technology exists to extract semantic information from resumes. I'm working on a prototype now that has me pretty stoked. It's not too much further to extracting similar information from a job description. Again

A concrete example might work like this: A job description is uploaded to a website where key information is extracted. Things like skills, industry, etc are extracted along with a time span. So ""A software developer with five years of experience using the Microsoft technology stack"" matches a resume that mentions C#, Sql Server and ASP.NET where those technologies were used within the last five years. Resumes are pulled from an email inbox, parsed, matched, and scored against an associated job description then made available for Hiring Manager Bob to review. Let's say HMB has 50 qualified applicants but would prefer to interview locally. HMB's boss prefers someone with industry experience. If the extracted information was presented to HMB and HMBB in a browsable form then they could prioritize the resumes they wanted to read.

My wife and I want to own our own business. She has about 8 or so years of experience in coffee

My first talking point would be whether to buy or start anew. We live a small town in Northern CA. There are 2 coffee shops here - and I firmly believe that our only real option toward getting ourselves a solvent business in this town would be to buy one of the shops out-right. I consider the market rather saturated and would be happier with a loan in order to take the business and its established traffic. (And majority of the town's coffee sales). I firmly believe that it would work out if we did.. the only reservation is that it's going to be a large.. large loan. 

We are starting with between $50k and $100k cash - and are hoping that if need be we can leverage a loan with the local bank (almost right next door to the coffee shop) to make it happen. If it doesn't or if I can't get another backer/signer we will have to explore the option of starting a new shop somewhere else.


I'm more comfortable with the idea of starting from scratch because it can be cheaper than buying someone out. You don't have to ""buy the name"" and you can make the business whatever you want to.. finesse the aesthetics and whatnot.. but the downside of course is that you don't have established traffic to kick things off from the very start.

Discovering new bioactive compounds - This is the ultimate goal of the company, HPLC, and LC-MS machines. (Analytical chemistry machines).

We are both going to be taking jobs at local biotech companies because we are both in debt from student loans and want to save money to fund ourselves.  I have had some questions about intellectual property claims and conflict of interest problems, and then have the companies we work for try to claim that we thought of it while working for them.  

Companies can't claim IP ownership over something you discover on your own time or while working for a 2nd employer (our company) can they?  (The companies won't be in the exact field we want to do research in

Neither of us have any belongings or personal assets

So...I am in Massachusetts

Here is a link to my states LLP page

http://www.sec.state.ma.us/cor/corpweb/corllp/llpinf.htm

and LLC page

http://www.sec.state.ma.us/cor/corpweb/corllc/llcinf.htm

The only real difference I see is that LLP's are automatically taxed as a ""partnership"" and an LLC

If we wanted to have equal share in the company, does an LLC or LLP make more sense?

We also wanted to register our name to ""save"" it so to speak, finished, tested, packaged, marketed etc etc .

So questions in an easier to read format.

1. Can your employer lay claim to intellectual property you discovered on your own time (ie-after 9-5 business hours)?
2. Does having your own LLC/LLP allow you to claim intellectual property for your own company for all the other hours of the day you are not at employer #1?
3. For two poor college students who don't want to be responsible for each other's life decisions outside our company/partnership
4. To register our name with the state and ""save"" it for ourselves, and we have no operating agreement yet which will outline as many ""what ifs"" as we can, so that hardships down the road can be settled by a written and signed contract we both agreed to in the beginning.

Thanks for any help or tips you can offer

And that's where it gets complicated. NC operates a state-run monopoly over liquor sales. The way things are now, as a state monopoly actually benefits the little guys. I even get better shelf space for being an in-state product. 

So essentially, NC Senate Bill 713, which would allow distilleries to sell their own products to the public (from their own location). It passed the state senate easily, but has been hung up in the house for almost a year now with nobody acting on it. 

Durham is experiencing a renaissance of new businesses. In the past five years, it clearly shifts the focus towards the direct-to-public bottle sales. 

For about $60k I can get the basic equipment I need, we're looking at about $170k, which includes paying myself a small salary so I can work full time, buying some nicer equipment, running everything more sustainably (wood gasification), and trying to host a lot of community events. If my projections are anywhere in the ballpark of correct, having direct sales would easily make up the difference in cost. 

I've been on the phone with a few state reps, doesn't seem to know what's happening with it, or they're just not telling me. Another well-connected person I spoke to told me there's doesn't seem to be anyone to sponsor it in the house.
