1334507481.0,sax87,"I'm a Jew, I love Israel, but do not blindly support it at the expense of others",,67,68, now I'm only culturally

I have never felt oppressed, they are all dead, only my part of the family in the US is still alive. I know that anti-Semitism exists, but it is not a threat to me.

If Israel had existed as a Jewish state before

But...

**Kinda big edit I didn't think about earlier:** Miko Peled was a family friend of ours growing up, but I knew that there were respectable people who worked towards peace by understanding both sides. In the end I don't agree that Israel needs to be a Jewish State in order to protect Jewish interests, especially in this context. A one-state solution is really what I support.

I do not blindly support Israel, and I know Israel continually violates international agreements for the sake of demonstrating their own power. If we, as Jews, are supposed to be better than everyone else, why are we against taking the high road, being gracious, extending a peaceful hand? Why do we value Jewish life and rights but not the lives and rights of all humans

I do not believe Israel belongs to the Jews, encourages oppression to ensure constant, complete security, makes people unwilling to make any concessions, and makes the whole issue into a religious, not a political one. It makes people close-minded.

I am sick and tired of being called anti-Israel because I think Palestine should have UN representation or that Israel is perpetuating conflict in the region through its policies. I'm sick and tired of being called an anti-Semite for believing that Israel doesn't belong to the Jews, dangerous, uneducated, or unethical (I've had enough friendly conversations with cab drivers, many of them Arabs, to know that many of them just want to make a good life for their children, not harm others based on their religion or race).

Most of all, or that Arabs and Jews and others have lived in the region for centuries, and no one group has a complete claim to the region. If I was alive in Germany in 1939, would I be labeled as a Jew Sympathizer? If I lived in the South and was against slavery, would I be labeled a Negro Sympathizer? If I lived in Iran would I not be labeled as an Israel Sympathizer?

I know everyone is born a human, but it has positive results for Israelis and Jews so it meets little protest with them.

I protest Israel not to the exclusion of Syria, etc., but because I know that there is a chance that my voice will not fall on deaf ears in Israel. I know that my opinions can elicit change. I protest Israel because I love Israel, and people I care about live there, just like you would protest a friend who was putting himself in danger. I am tired of hearing that because other countries are worse, my criticism of Israel is baseless.

I do not want to see a country that I love go down a road of extreme nationalism tied to a racial identity (a familiar and troubling combination), and vilification of a Palestinians in general because of the actions of a few. I do not want to, in 10 years, see that fear of being called anti-Semitic in the wake of the holocaust led people to overlook another oppression.",,False,self,True,t3_sax87

Still

If you want to live in peace then prove it. Stop supporting those that promote conflict and constantly point fingers saying ""they started it"". Nobody knows and/or cares anymore.

You are **never** going to win

I can't take it anymore
When ""something happens"" you suddenly pull out facts

Sometimes I almost feel like I want you guys to kill each other for good and be done with you.

To start those who follow the events comfortably sitting thousands of miles away from any actual rockets or even sand, but they are too rare.

To those who live in the affected areas

Could we see Israelis offering housing to Palestinians made homeless ? Can you guys show the world that your leaders are quite possibly committing serious war crimes and you do not support them

To those who actually do this sort of thing

For the love of Jesus, please stop being war tools, stop promoting this endless conflict.

I've studied the Israel-Palestine struggle for a bit now and I have several questions for this board

Firstly

What is the specific goal of the Palestinian struggle? Does ""end the occupation"" mean the West Bank and Gaza

Would a Palestinian state be theocratic or secular? Would Israeli Jews be able to live in the area

Can there be room for multiple states rather than one Palestinian state or one Zionist state? Like Jewish

Is the ""Right of Return"" realistic given that that whole area is already quite overpopulated and running out of water?

Is the Palestinian flag racist

Would Palestine be a nation of it's own

Are there alternatives to Hamas and Fatah? Since neither one seems to be in the best interest of the Palestinian people.

power",3,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/nygsv/how_iran_can_avert_catastrophe_put_women_in_power/,"This post is inspired, in part, by the eloquence of the women who have taken up the defense of the Palestinian people.  See my comment [here](/r/NewIsrael/comments/nxwmy/who_said_israel_has_a_right_to_exist/).

The Iranian effort to avert war relies on diplomacy based on reason.

The U.S. / Israel effort to initiate war relies on theater -- with Iran cast as Insane Supervillain and the U.S. cast as the White Knight.  

Iranian diplomacy, because reason is constrained by reality and theater is unconstrained.  

* The U.S. has shown a complete disregard for reality.  ""Iranian Nukes"" are no more real than ""Iraqi WMDs""

* The U.S. also shows complete disregard for its own interests.  Attacking Iran will double the price of oil and tank the U.S. economy.  Countless lives will be lost, all to achieve nothing.  

* The U.S. has shown no interest in diplomacy.  Iran has offered numerous [conciliatory proposals](http://www.iranaffairs.com/iran_affairs/2011/11/iran-offered-to-recognize-israel-in-2003.html) that attempt to address nuclear concerns.  Most of these proposals are instantly dismissed by the U.S. and Israel.  At one point, Iran accepted a proposal by Brazil and Turkey and the U.S. torpedoed it.

U.S. politicians, and that is to obey their sponsors in Tel Aviv.  Since 2002, Israel has been ordering the U.S. to attack Iran, and the U.S. is eager to comply, no matter what the cost to America and the world.  Under the trance of suicidal bellicosity, the U.S. is marching straight into the sea of war and madness.  

Diplomacy based on reason is powerless to stop this lemming-like march.  The lemming just covers its ears.  I see only one way to break this war trance: Iran must fight the U.S. propaganda theater with theater of its own.  

In particular, for example, should be a woman.  

The U.S. and Israel want to annilate Iran for one reason: Iran rejects global domination by the Ziosphere.  The need to dominate the world is what drives Israel and the U.S..  

That need for domination is a male game, the U.S. is at a loss.  

Because the U.S. treats negotiations only as a launching pad for war

But the presence of the woman in a position of power would enable Iran to combat the theater of the war-makers.  The cave-man versus cave-men script would no longer work.  The U.S. would have to come up with a new script for war-making, and might become strong enough to actually influence the rulers in this ""Democracy"".

Among the speakers was the interior minister of the Icelandic government and Left-Green Party who condemned the Israeli actions and took a much more ""hardline"" stance than the foreign minister who ""condemned both parties"" (or something). The finance minister

A Palestinian held a passionate speech condemning the attacks

Note that Google translate made a few major errors in translation that completely undermined the description of the events so please check the original Hebrew text carefully before complaining about mistranslations.

**Tourists Beaten at the Allenby Crossing to be Compensated with ILS 166

The Jerusalem Magistrate's Court decided two weeks ago that a Palestinian born American citizen and her son, will receive compensation of ILS 166 thousand ($42,000). While the court granted them compensation, it did not conclude that the security guards, who are employees of the *Israeli Airport Authority* and a private security company *Security Systems*, acted negligently or violated security procedures.

The incident occurred in July 2006, came to Jordan with her 16-year-old son, Michael Shaheen. They wanted to enter Israel via the Allenby Bridge, but the personnel of *Security Systems* suspected that the son was a terrorist before they entered security. The mother and son claimed that one of the guards approached Shaheen shouting and waving his hands, but the son did not respond since he speaks no Hebrew nor Arabic. The son claimed that he did not know that this person was a security guard and was afraid that he was trying to steal his music player from his pocket. The mother began shouting and the guard punched her in the face and hit her son. Shaheen claimed that the security guard threw him onto the floor and threw away the card he presented that states that he suffers from a heart condition. He said that another security guard then came and hit him. A third guard cocked his gun and aimed it at the mother's head, yelling at her to shut up and threatened that if she spoke, he would shoot her. The medical report submitted to the court showed that she suffered a broken nose and required hospital treatment.

The two were then handcuffed and taken into a side room. Some time later, since the security guards acted according to the standard police and *Shin-Bet* procedures. *Security Systems* argued that *""the guards had immunity, since this was a wartime action""*.",,False,self,t5_2qhak,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/wyogy/israeli_court_grants_palestinianamerican_tourists/
