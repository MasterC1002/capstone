I started by chopping up a fairly large onion, pepper, salt, and tried to add a tiny bit of sugar... when i put WAY too much sugar, to the point that it melted into a liquidy soup.

I figured, with a little of the broccoli stalk i had remaining. I added a bit of hot pepper flakes for a zip and cooked it for about 10-15 min.

Now, it seems like it could be a legit asian dish. It's sweet, has a little kick, and has a nice consistency.

1294161571.0,ew2wq,A Whole Bunch of Tips and Tactics from Me Brain,vgsandrew,165,17,90,"Skipping the basics for some random little tricks and tactical thoughts I’ve picked up over time.  Many you probably already know, but like to get around to a little bit of everything.  Run all kits and styles

General Tips:

Use the parachute at the very end of your fall.  Opening it a split second before you hit the ground will prevent any damage and you won’t be a floating duck for fire on the way down.  When dropping free fall from a chopper

When disarming an M-COM 

Mines stay on the ground even after you die and switch perks or kits

Use your kits situationally.  Try not to become married to one class for an entire match.  Depending on the section of the map, assess the situation and come back as the class that will help your team the most on that section.

Remember every enemy you kill leaves free goodies for you, get some more ammo, and then grab your kit back and hop back to it.  Even the best players forget to do this all the time.

If a medic on your team dies, hit the kit swap button.  You will revive him and swap kits with each other at the same time, leaving both of you with your original loadout and very little time lost.

Using the knife is iffy no matter what

When spotting, quickly covering all important points.

In hardcore, you know there’s an enemy hidden directly in your line of site.  Hitting the start button to pull up the main map will also reveal their location, but it’s usually easier to find them visually.

If you started a squad with friends and then joined a game, go to the scoreboard section and you can invite any players from your team or the other team into your squad.  This is great for when playing on your own on a bad team, try to find the few other competent players in the game, and then invite them to your squad.

Use grenades as a way to spot non visible enemies on the second floor or roof of buildings.  When tossed in their vicinity

You can’t reload on the run

Medics can revive people through doors and walls as though the obstructions weren’t there.

The UAV is reparable.

This applies to almost all FPS, you’ll be able to hear an enemy crunching on the snow outside, if those steps are behind, to the side, or in front of you, and the shift to heels clacking on wood when he steps inside below you.  Once you get used to it, you will develop a spatial sense of the battlefield that goes far beyond your field of view.  And as an added bonus you will get knifed far

Due to the extreme nature of squad and teamwork in BFBC2

Rush:

There is almost always a sniping or other angle to kill the UAV pilot on the first section of any Rush map, the out of bounds timer will stop, and when the UAV blows up you will have a full 10 seconds to cause spawn mayhem or run back to safety.

On Rush defense often your best chance for winning is realizing when a set of M-COMs is a lost cause and setting up your defenses for the next section ahead of time.   This means strategic mine placement, and/or staking out a good hiding place to commandeer one of the attacker's prized vehicles as soon as it spawns. If you want to get really nasty, drop mines on the spots where the enemy vehicles will spawn.  Choppers, tanks, etc. As soon as they hop in and try to move, boom.  This all slows down the enemy attack and gives you a chance to get your lines set up and dug in.

On offense, you’re making things harder on your teammates.  On defense, the more you can knock down and open up the level, the harder you will make it on the attackers.  Blowing open non-destructible M-COM  buildings should almost always be a priority.  On sniper heavy maps, sometimes leaving up the lead wall will help with disarming without leaving corners for attackers to hide in once they’ve armed the M-COM.

On defense, but as soon as you do, the enemy now has their attention focused on the difficult M-COM instead of divided amongst two.  This applies to sets where one M-COM is much more difficult as well.  I’ve lost on attack on the last set of Nelson Bay to an inferior team many a time because my team took A first and then bled 60+ tickets trying to break the stronghold at B, when it would have been a walk in the park to take B first.

Snipers - don’t be a bush wookie, as they expect you’re firing from the back of your base.  You will create a wonderful spawn point for your squad, try not to give it up by only killing the enemy when there is a tactical advantage (i.e. when the M-COM is armed, etc), and by only taking headshots so you don’t give up your position.  For the rest of the squad, if you run into the rare, rare, DO NOT spawn on him and immediately open fire

Squad Deathmatch:

Because there are 4 squads, the single most important strategy in deathmatch is to constantly be in the middle of the action.  Camping usually leads to losing.  Engage the enemy as frequently as possible.

Take advantage of the revenge nature of players - once killed their first instinct will be to head right back to you to even the score.  Reset your position to watch over your old position and you can often take advantage of your opponent’s recklessness.

With a good squad, with your squad set in the best positions, and you will almost always have someone to spawn on in order to hold that section of the map.  If all 4 members of your squad are engaged in constant action through the round, you are very likely to win.

More than any other mode, less explosions, and less action, it is easier to pick up all environmental noise and figure out exactly where people are and what’s happening around you, at much further distances than in Rush or Conquest.

And I think that’s plenty for now ☺",,t5_2rgyt,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/badcompany2/comments/ew2wq/a_whole_bunch_of_tips_and_tactics_from_me_brain/

This is actually a cut and paste from a post of mine about a year ago. But I just want to put this out there so the front page isnt filled with people who've put 5 hours into this game freaking out that their stats have disappeared.

So

Port Valdez: http://maps.google.com/maps?q=port+valdez&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Port+Valdez&amp;ll=61.08245

Arica Harbor: http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=arica+chile&amp;sll=8.954093,+Chile&amp;ll=-18.481074,-70.313616&amp;spn=0.027596,0.055189&amp;t=h&amp;z=14
A couple things are different

Valaparaiso: http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Valpara%C3%ADso,0.110378&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Valparaiso,+Chile&amp;t=h&amp;z=12&amp;lci=com.panoramio.all I'm gonna go ahead and say this one doesnt fit exactly. I think you really are supposed to be a little bit south. Laguna Verde would be the villiage in the third set of mcoms...I think they fudged this one around a bit for gameplay and balance, but still looks fairly close.

Isla Innocentes: http://maps.google.com/maps?q=isla+inocentes+chile&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Isla+Inocentes,0.883026&amp;t=h&amp;z=10
This one is kinda close. The real isla innocentes looks to be the first island north that they modeled the mp map. This one looks really close though.

Panama Canal:
http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=panama+canal&amp;sll=61.08245,+Panama&amp;ll=8.954093,-79.561143&amp;spn=0.014371,0.027595&amp;t=h&amp;z=15
Another one that's basically spot on.

The Atacama desert is a stretch of 400 miles in northern Chile. It's one of the driest places in the world. Googling for ""atacama shipwreck"" doesnt really yeild that much...the shipwreck is actually pretty charictaristic of Namibia

That being said


-  The destructible environments in BC2 are far more of a focus.  In BF3

- The motion mines were a thing of genius.  The TUGS just doesn't compare.  Motion mines allowed you to interact with team mates half way across the map.  It encouraged team play unlike anything else I had ever seen.

- While BC2 has fewer models of tanks / jeeps etc, it's well known that developers consider these things). 


- BC2 maps were just right given the 360 player limitations.  If a few people drop out


Again,  I'd be playing for the next 10 years - and I'm sure that's why they don't release such things anymore.

**THE REAL DEAL ABOUT SHOTGUNS**

No bullshit. Just facts and figures. Read this and you will know all about shotguns. You should be able to use this info to inform your tactics.

**BUCKSHOT**

For *all shotguns* each pellet does 14.3 damage up to 8m

This means you need 7 pellets in the body to kill up close. Spread and low damage makes kills at long range quite hard.

Pumps shoot 12 pellets

Magnum ammo increases damage by 1.25x

Headshots add a further damage multiplier of 2.5x. This means 3 pellets in the head will kill at close range. That's how you can clear a room with an auto shotgun...

**SLUGS w/ PUMP**

Slugs rock. They give a shotgun the same damage profile as a bolt-action rifle.

100 damage up to 10m

That's a one-shot kill at close range

Pump + slugs = embarrassment cannon.

Magnum ammo **doubles** the effective one-shot kill range to 20m

**SLUGS w/ AUTO**

SAT analogy time

(answer: semi-auto sniper rifle)

39 damage up to 8m

This is a bit trickier to work with. Headshots are never one-shot kills

**40mm**

The 40mm assault shotgun is really

It shoots 12 pellets, though) to kill **at any range**.

**THE BEST SHOTGUN**

The NS2000 is the best pump shotgun, giving you potentially more visibility than the others.

The SPAS has the slowest reload of the pumps. It sucks. There is no way in which the SPAS is better than the 870.

The USAS has a slightly better plain reload time than the SAIGA

Otherwise

**MORE NOTES ON HARDCORE**

Hardcore means players have 60 health. Weapon damage remains the same. Two pellets in the head or five in the body will kill up close. This means *autos can one-shot kill without magnum ammo*

Pump shotguns with slugs and magnum ammo will kill with one hit at any range with any shot placement. Autos with slugs and magnum ammo will kill with one headshot or two body shots at any range. This is a bit of a different dynamic than in non-hardcore

Auto + slugs (no magnum) kills with two shots up close, making it not quite as useful.",,False,,t5_2rgyt,True,ps3,

I hope we can compile a list here of people who want to play in a squad and are willing to give/take orders.  

If you want, kit preference(s), and if you'd like to be a leader or a grunt.  I'd encourage anyone who wishes to be a squad leader [to link to their stats](http://bfbc2.elxx.net/sigg-o-matic.php) so people can evaluate your gameplay style before joining your squad (percent of points from team/squad scores are good to look at when picking teammates).

**EDIT**: At the suggestion of defree

**tl;dr**: Leave a comment with your platform, and if you'd like to be a leader or a grunt.

* Each base has a UAV for the attackers. As much fun as it is to shoot the UAV's machine gun at people
* You can eventually whittle away at an M-Com with grenades, sneak around without killing anyone and hit it. You can also swap your assault rifle for a shotgun, Thompson, M14 or G3 to get C4 to go with your ammo box, which is a nice combo. It will take longer to get the crate and you won't have a motion mine covering your ass, so beware.
* It's really not worth arming an M-Com if you can drop a building on it. The only time I arm an M-Com in a destructible building is right before I drop the building on it
* I've read that buildings have an overall HP counter
* Speaking of 40mm grenades
* Mortar strikes are good against buildings


**Nelson Bay**

At the first base, as it seems B is always the one that gets covered. You can drop A, but it's a bitch compared to B.

At the second base, you can keep using that UAV to drop B with help from people shooting grenades at the ""front side,"" while hiding by the downed helicopter. (When defending this point, make sure to take out the bridges by A on the frozen river.) Again, I recommend C4 for A. Drop B. 

At the third base, smoking the room while a recon goes to town on the M-Com. Sneak around to B and put a hole in the wall by the M-Com. Most people only guard the doorways. Stay to the ""front side"" of B, since a lot of snipers like to sit on the back side in the two-story green trailer.



**Arica Harbor**

As cheap as it may be
Always take B first. Always. I hate Arica on Rush, try to coordinate a tank attack on the front of the base while two recons on the ATV sneak around and take B. Drop A at your leisure once you finish B. (And take out the sniper towers ASAP.)

Second base, you can drop B quickly with the UAV. Have the UAV pilot (or a tank) open the shutters for you, so you don't have to stand there in the road. 

Third point, as you can sneak around under the bridge, come up behind the point and C4 the hell out of the M-Com with minimal resistance. Go wide around the right side, run to the bridge and get there early. Have a squad mate chill down under the bridge as a mobile spawn point and get to it. 

Fourth point, but the benefit to taking B first is that you have less distance to travel and you can get people to cover you from the train cars. 

Final point



**Valparaiso**

First point

Second point, get someone to hop on the stationary AT and fire at B. 

Third point, then swim back to avoid anyone watching the front.

Fourth point, but it's always ideal to do that, so go A first. You can hide behind (or in) the sniper town at B and do it piecemeal. 

Final point



**Port Valdez**

You should know this by now

The second easiest M-Com in the game is the first point's A M-Com. You can actually ram the house down with the tank. (Easy defense is to throw down mines in the forest behind A, leaving the whole team to focus on B. A is so fragile; it almost doesn't matter. With B, use the light tank to cover the concrete three-story behind the hole and smoke the area. You can actually ram a few ATVs with C4 on them into B, but you knew that already.

The second point

The third point, but it takes 5-6 rockets. C4 and smoke might be better, so you don't get sniped from the concrete building behind you. As for B, wait for a lull in the Apache fire and drive the party bus into B. (No, seriously. Just dodge the blocks in the road and it's easy.) You can use the gun on the bus to cover the back door of B and the rest of the squad can use the bus to hop up on top of the containers. The only things to fear here are the Apache and land mines. 

The fourth point, and get up to the helipad. Have someone hang out around the stationary AT building as a mobile spawn point. Take A with C4. B, you can literally take from the roof. There's a skylight window overlooking the M-Com and you can kill it with rockets/grenades easily. Have three people spamming ordinance down and the fourth watching the stairs/ladder.

Here's the easy stuff:

* W - increases altitude
* S - decreases altitude
* A - turns helicopter left
* D - turns helicopter right

Now on to the mouse controls which are probably where people are totally having their minds blown.

Roll - this is movement of the helicopter to the left or right, (to swing left; move the mouse left).

Pitch - This tilts the helicopter forward or backwards.  Move the mouse forward to lean the nose forward essentially propelling the helicopter forward

Now the key to mouse movement is self control.  You don't want to make HUGE tilts in any direction; it'll just cause the choppa to crash into the ground.  Another big thing is that for every movement you make you need to have a counter movement to stop. So when you are strafing left and you're ready to stop you want to not just reset the mouse to the starting position

Now you're not going to be able to pilot the Apache and the Havoc like some kind of pro right off the bat

Some other blackhawk piloting tips...
 
* Use **V** **smoke**!!! There are no weapons as a pilot and it really makes you a nuisance to people when they can't plant a dart on your choppa. (If you're a gunner use **V** **warhead**! It's good for any vehicle or mounted gun!)

* Dodging rockets really isn't too hard

* Choppers can be repaired midair! (at least the blackhawk and the Hind can) Engineers that are passengers on these two kinds of helicopters can whip out the repair tools and aim them at the ceiling or floor of the helicopter and repair it! Thing is though you have to have the helicopter generally level

* If you decide to be a dedicated engineer in a helicopter then equip **V** **armor**! A Helicopter will be able to sustain a rocket hit if someone has it equipped that's riding along (It will take a helicopter from 100 to 7 armor; according Daminox)! This gives the engineer riding along a chance to rack up some extra points.

I ducked behind some trees to reload my weapons and throw out an ammo box. While reloading I look at two houses near where I was hiding. With only a small alley separating them, volleys of bullets peppered the windows. Grenades flew from one window into the other. People were shooting from both floors.

I feel like most people are in denial about how disappointing BF3 is. It may be because we had such high and unrealistic expectations, plain and simple. Furthermore it was tweaked to attract a new demographic that previously steered clear from BF titles in the past. What transpired was a mess of a game that seems to have a cap on how fun it can be. Patches can and have fixed many issues, but a lot of it are not going to be patched.

Gadgets:

If you learn to time it properly, grenades, motions mines, etc. far further than normal by jumping while in the middle of the toss.  For health/ammo packs, you want to jump first, then toss. For max distance, look up at a 45 degree angle while pushing forward.  This especially useful with C4, like taking out 2nd story stair/building campers by tossing bricks up from the outside and detonating.

Mines have a set time of a few seconds after being dropped, craters and water.  Depending on the vehicle and armor, how dead on the vehicle hits the mine, and if you have the explosive perk running either one or two will do the job. Be mindful of the blast radius, if you place mines too close they will create a chain reaction, blowing up all of your mines and/or teammates mines when you could have had the next set waiting for another vehicle.

Many players recognize the C4 noise when placed on their tanks and will hop out as soon as you place it.  A stealthy alternative against stationary tanks is to drop two mines and then toss a grenade onto them.  Or

C4 can be used extremely effectively as a large mine trap against moving vehicles.  Place your sticks on a commonly used road

Defibs open doors and cut down fences just like a knife.  Medics can use this tactic when sneaking behind enemy lines.  Many players are conditioned to listen for the sound of a knife thrust or gun fire but won’t give a second thought to the sound of a defib even right next to them.

Pay attention to motion sensor as you toss them ahead of you

If you hear a motion sensor beeping but don’t see one on your map

In normal mode, it’s a friendly mine, if they remain, it’s an enemy mine.

Vehicles:

Tanks are extremely powerful when used effectively but all too often players rush in with them as though they are indestructible killing machines.  Tanks are usually most effective when used from medium range, gives you the ability to duck back behind cover, and allows time to repair damage from rockets.

If you’re by yourself in a tank, and most players will try to C4 the tank to destroy it, you can usually get a few stealth kills followed by a few C4 revenge kills by constantly scanning the approach points to the tank before being taken out.

The warhead vehicle perk is extremely effective for gunners in air vehicles, they’re mowing the opposition down like crazy.

Burning tanks are the best hiding spot in the game

All vehicles except the UAV have a third person viewing option (press up on the dpad on PS3), water vehicles and Hummers allow for a better viewing angle when driving.  Tanks make it easier to see C4 bombers creeping up on you. etc.  On PS3, the extra analog pad can be used to swivel the camera around your vehicle, which for example can be useful to look for snipers while passing an island on a jet ski.

Choppers have a wider out of bounds area than infantry on most maps, often hidden from the enemy line of site and fire.

Transport vehicles are basically tinfoil deathtraps for mines, small arms fire, etc for all people riding in them.  While it’s human nature to want to get into the action as soon as possible and spawn onto your teammate for the joy ride, it’s far more effective to watch him reach the destination and then spawn.  On my more coordinated squads at the start of a rush attack game, we’ll designate one person to spawn in and drive their vehicle up to the objective ASAP, and have everyone spawn on him once he gets there.  Also helps prevent people getting stuck on foot on maps like Arica Harbor when all the vehicles get nabbed by lone wolfs.

When you steal an enemy vehicle

When attempting a road kill with the quad bike

Deathmatch:

When playing normal mode squad deathmatch

Medics reviving in deathmatch do not take a kill away from the other team and does not help your ticket count.  I’ve often seen a player killed, and his squad mate gets killed again before he has a chance to react.  3 quick tickets for the opposing team.  But for special situations, I find it’s usually better to take the respawn time and come back situationally aware with a full clip.

Random:

I use FPS Freek analog thumb extenders; they basically raise the analog stick so you have a wider range of motion, something like $10 for a pair, and you only need one per controller as the left analog stick doesn’t really need any help.

Most weapons reload long before the reload animations finish.  You can cut down reload times by quick switching to your pistol and back by double pressing the button as soon as you see the ammo count reset.  Eventually this timing will become second nature.  You can also use this method to cancel a reload if you still have bullets in the chamber and suddenly find yourself under duress.

You can get through large windows by jumping towards the windowsill and then crouching to hop through.  Especially useful when both doors are still up so you can give the appearance the building is unoccupied.

The default language for Russian forces is Russian

If you are the only player on a squad with a mic

When sniping long distances, etc. and line up additional shots.  Eventually your sense of placement will become second nature, but this eliminates much of the guesswork early on.

Based on the general unwillingness to go through the mumble process on the part of many and general opposition to the current system I have three propositions:

1. Erase the VIP system. It only creates controversy and although some are saying the queue would put them off from playing the server

2. Someone just creates a new server. Fairly self-explanatory but given the sheer height of some people's horses regarding their VIP status removing the current format may anger some. This could be avoided by creating a new server

3. Use reddit for the VIP process. Why not use the current messaging system or even a subreddit for requesting VIP status. It's a medium we are all familiar with and perfectly streamlines the process as we don't have to download unfamiliar software and learn to use it/not be able to use it. I would be perfectly happy to start running a subreddit where people can simply list their name and request a VIP status that could be available to us all. This may also be a bit of a stretch but why not just grant VIP to anyone that has used the in-game name and platform type that this subreddt currently uses and automatically adds anybody else who goes through that process. Again

TL;DR I like to eat cheese sandwiches with my pet flamingo on Monday.

I don't normally share stories that are about playing any games

It's Oasis rush, so I spawn with extra AT mines. I am running through the vineyard dropping AT mines in strategic spots as I usually do on defense, and as soon as I run out I fall back to the 3rd set of mcoms. 

At this point you could probably care less, so I lob a few rounds towards them. As soon as they noticed me they started to charge across the vineyard field, all 3 of them. FUCKING BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM, all 3 simultaneously blow up, getting 6 kills and destroying 3 vehicles within 2 seconds of each other. This was followed by 10 or so enemy infantry units also charging into the wetlands, and I open fire with the nade launcher taking out countless infantry along with the tanks. All of this happening in under a minute.

I don't think this will ever happen again

* Will the maps have similar gameplay features as in BC1 (MEC

Unfortunately they will not. The maps have been made with the idea and vision of Bad Company 2. The maps have been suited to fit the vision


* Do you have a release date ready for us?

I do not have a release date for you yet. I'm however working on to get a release date out for you guys. The whole idea of Map Pack 7 was to announce that ""Hey guys


* Why not Cold war CQ and Heavy Metal Rush?

The specific thought was to make Conquest even more vehicle packed than Atacama Desert with an emphasis on brutal clashes between tanks. With four helicopters in the sky and 8 tanks on the ground

Heavy Metal Rush didn't really fit into our vision


* Why did you choose Oasis and Harvest Day? There were plenty of other maps to choose from!

We decided to go with these after taking a look at the Facebook poll posted some months ago. We also listened to a lot of voices from the Community specifically wanting Oasis and Harvest Day. The maps also differ quite well from eachother.

The maps are going to be as you remember them from BC1. Wether there are bottlenecks or not is what I have experienced from my years as a gamer

We have polished the maps

* Are these maps aimed for 2011 or 2010 as long as problems are worked out?  Not asking for a specific date...just if they were meant for 2010 or 2011 under the original plan.

I can't comment on that question

1.  Nobody uses the built in VOIP.  I think I've heard one person in 40 hours of playing

2.  The 'chat' options are terrible.  You can't chat when you're dead, there's a brief but perceptible period during which the next character you type is just dropped on the floor.  And you don't get to type much.  And the chat stays on your screen only very briefly.

3.  In fact

4.  Other battlefield games (back in the dusty recollections of my history) at least let you give text commands (e.g. 'medic!') so that people around you could react to what's happening.  In this game, very rarely, appropriate (e.g., you're behind enemy lines, alone, you drop an ammo box, and you yell 'LOL THERE IS AN AMMO BOX HERE EVERYONE LOL' in your thick middle eastern accent

5.  Much of the appeal of the game is that teamwork is really useful, where you have a chance to organize and form a team before the match starts, seems like it's mandatory for something like this.

6.  There's no obvious 'clan discovery mechanism'.  Let's say that you're new to this game, bond up and make new guilds/teams/organized groups.  There's no analogue 'public area' for BC2.

**[PS3 Reddit League post](http://www.reddit.com/r/ps3bc2/comments/bxv16/ps3_bad_company_2_reddit_league/)**

How would you guys feel about starting a reddit based BC2 League? The competitive format seems to be 8v8 Conquest

I am the current Commissioner of the [Reddit Intramural TF2 League](http://thefpm.com) and would like to do something similar for BC2. What do you guys think?

::EDIT::

Some more info on how I think this should go down:

We would see (generally) how many people are interested. Based on that number we would pick a number of teams to have. Lets say that around 60 people express an interest (for comparison, each team has 2 potential subs.

I'm not sure how the teams would be picked. For TF2 we did a very successful draft, and then have free agents who aren't committed to a team but would be willing to fill the last spot on a 7 man team, etc. No matter how we do it, the first season would essentially just be PUGs so that you get to know your fellow players. I'm open to suggestions on how the team picking would work.

As to scheduling, they must play at the default time that is also assigned to them at the beginning of the week. If they can't get the minimum number of players into the default game, they forfeit. I don't know how well this would work here, but it works great for TF2.

1302032602.0,gjc45,[Beginner's Guide]: 1-13 to Decent Player in No Time!,vandeemter,60,9,43,"Getting to the point where I became decent at this game was a bit frustrating; my first several games consisted of a cycle quite similar to this:

Spawn -&gt; Run towards red dots to kill them -&gt; I get sniped/shot/rocketed/etc. and die -&gt; Respawn -&gt; Die quickly -&gt; ??? -&gt; Game ends

So

**1) Understand the point of the two game modes.** This game isn't a Black Ops-style deathmatch. It's more fun than that. In RUSH mode, you have to run to the MCOM and activate it by holding down the action button (E on PC). On attack, your team has a limited number of lives to expend; once this counter reaches 0, you lose. If you destroy BOTH MCOM stations, the map will create 2-3 more sets of MCOM stations for your team to destroy, resetting your lives (called ""tickets"") back to full after each pair you destroy. On defense, your job is to run down the enemy's tickets to 0 before they blow up all of the pairs of MCOM stations. It takes you longer to disarm the MCOM than it takes them to arm it. On defense
In CONQUEST mode

**2) Easiest class to start with and learn is the medic, drop these to heal squadmates and teammates, and when a firefight is about to break out. If you get injured/shot at, run for cover and throw a healthpack towards that cover, so you quickly heal once you're there. Once you unlock the defibrillator, revive teammates that have died ONLY WHEN the coast is clear. Once you get better, you'll be able to make more risky calls, don't do things like run out in front of a tank to revive someone. With a medic, and then go back to his own

**3) Learn to shoot.** The secret for all guns (credit to the responses in my ""how to shoot an LMG"" thread) is to tap the trigger button as quickly as you can to get the highest firing rate while still maintaining accuracy. Always scope

**4) USE COVER.** Don't run out into the open, tanks, what have you, but don't run out into the open or you suddenly become a target for snipers and anyone else with a scope.

**5) SPOT enemy players.** On PC, get behind cover for a couple of seconds before coming back out, so your spot-beacon disappears. Running through/behind smoke of any kind will immediately remove your spot.

**6) Practice and learn the maps.** This part is all about the time you invest. When you join a squad, which paths they take to/from the MCOM stations, etc.

**7) Don't pilot helicopters** unless you have spent many hours on an empty server practicing. It's harder than it looks to pilot those things without being immediately shot down. And to have any shot at pulling off the stunts that pro pilots perform (flying the attack chopper like it's a falcon on PCP or circling the enemy base quickly in the blackhawk)

**8) Download the ""Battlefield Bad Company 2 Configurator""**: http://forums.electronicarts.co.uk/battlefield-bad-company-2-pc/1009847-em-clan-certified-bc2-configurator-best.html 
In this tool, 6.00 for Vehicle/Stationary Turret, 250 for Helicopter, and 1.00 for Free View. On the Video Settings tab, experiment with increasing the FOV setting from the default 55 to something like 65 or 80 and see if you like it. You see more to your right and left, but things look farther away (i.e. you zoom out).

1362631826.0,19tsvj,Post Bad Company 2 Era Depression,cellularresp,61,11,39,"Ive been really depressed for a while now. Here's my story
Ive always liked video games, which at the time was an alright game. My buddies and i would switch off playing and having fun for 30 mins or so but we would get bored rather quickly and go do something else. Eventually in March 2010 I heard of a game called ""Battlefield: Bad Company 2"" that would be released that featured destructible environments, which I thought was a much needed feature in all video games and decided to buy it and play it with my roommates. That began a 3 year journey that consumed my life. I've always liked games but I never ""liked"" a game like this. This game was the most masterfully crafted multiplayer experience I've ever encountered and I soon found myself neglecting actual human relationships for virtual ones with my many dozen ""xbros"". This social aspect combined with absolutely pleasureful gameplay turned a simple diversion into an obsession. I would play everyday, for hours, at its height it was the most fun Ive ever had in front of a screen and little else could compare to it fun:time ratio. This all came to a screeching halt when BF3 arrived. I had erroneously assumed that BF3 would be a logical successor to BC2, not only that it would be to BC2 what BC2 was to MW2. Boy was I wrong, what greeted me in Oct '11 was a boring, pander to too many audiences and fail to live up to explicit promises. With it went the community and my xbox live friends who failed to see how BF3 was a ""de-evolution"" (even though most will admit that BC2 was better). All the skills I gained from BC2 not only did not transfer well to BF3 but was a hindrance; stopping

**tl/dr: I was jaded by how good BC2 was and am depressed that it is unlikely that any other game can live up to it and provide the same amount of satisfaction.**

1340853818.0,vq0cy,The reddit BC2 server is happening.  I need your input and help.,nickmh,56,8,56,"So we're going to go ahead and do this

**Location:**

The server that badbadrobot has very kindly offered us is based in Chicago.  I personally do not have a problem with that, no big deal.  More on this below.

**Admins:**

We'll need admins

**RedditGaming/RUGC:**

I need someone to find out how we can get the server listed on redditgaming.com again (as well as fix the ""Unofficial Reddit Servers"" link on the right)


**Mumble:**

There were some asking about a voice server.  There is already one setup with a BC2 channel.  We are good there.

**Map Rotation / Rules:**

I am in favor of a 32-man 24/7 Rush server.  Let me know your thoughts.
Rush maps I would like to see:

* Valparaiso
* Isla
* Arica
* Cold War
* Nelson Bay
* Oasis
* Atacama
* *Harvest Day per player feedback*

I don't want a lot of rules on the server.  No stupid swearing filter, no stupid blinking text that comes up everytime someone gets a knife kill.  Maybe just a kick if afk for 5 minutes or so.  Votekick - I'm on the fence about this, convince me.

Thoughts?


**$$$$ / VIP:**

Badbadrobot has suggested either a donation system (which I support) and/or purchasing a VIP slot (I'm on the fence, was kind of a pain, but if enough people support it then we'll do it.  Let me know what you think.  
If we choose to forgo the Chicago server and get our own server in Dallas, especially for a top notch NFO server.  A small donation from a few people every once in awhile will go a long way.  I'm not going to force donation out of people.


If any of the admins of the previous servers are reading this


**Update 6/28 - Decisions**

Keep in mind that if a decision is not working

* I've chosen **Dallas** as the location.  I'd rather have most people have a great experience than have a few have excellent and the rest have average.
* VIP is still a decision I have not made yet.  If the donations seem to be rolling in semiregularly
* The map rotation is going to stay as it is above
* No hardcore. No conquest for the time being
* Votekick will be implemented.  If it gets abused
* Admins are as follows: PainTrain04, possibly 1 or 2 more depending on needs
* *Joeybits* has suggested we do some weekly or monthly events...that sounds awesome.  Maybe some tournaments?

### Primary

The Saiga 20K or USAS-12 are your primary. They have the same stats but the Saiga is semi-automatic and the USAS is automatic. Your choice

#### What problems does this solve?

Exchanging your machine gun increases your damage output for short to medium ranges. This therefore solves the problem where a team mate goes down as they were entering a room and you want to go in to save them, you can outgun even an assault class in close combat.

This also solves the problem of actually killing people in a building environment! Your DPS, and far outguns them at short range (&lt;10 meters)

#### What problems does this create?

Your magazine size is now smaller and you can not lay down effective suppressing fire. You can only kill one or two enemies (if you're lucky) with the small 6 shell magazine before reloading. You only get 24 shells spare

In reality

We can fix the other problems with perks:

### Perks

I find the shotgun amazing when you combine it with double magazine size perk. This gives you 12 shells of entire-squad-killing power instead of a mere sniper-and-maybe-his-buddy 6 shell magazine. This also lets you gun down a medic or engy at medium range and still have some shells left for whoever you just killed's friend. 

When I'm not with friends on voice chat in a squad

If I do have a buddy I take the increased health kit range or the Light Combat Equipment perk (since I'm shotgunning

### Pistol

I like the 6-shot revolver. It takes down an enemy in 3 hits to the body or 1 to the head. It chews ammo

And don't worry about tracer dart. You're a medic, or recon take care of vehicles (though shotgunning a jeep or 4 wheeler driver is hilarious and easy).

### Some things to keep in mind

You're a medic! Revive people! You get 80 points for reviving a squad mate

Both the shotgun and revolver take ages to reload

**This kit is not well rounded.** If a recon or assault can see you from medium to long range

There's no need to crouch or aim down the sights of the shotgun

* Communication is key

* This has been said over and over again

* If you're sat at the back of the base as a recon on attack, fuck your mother in the ass and stick my shit covered dick in your eye.

Don't give me that ""Well I have more points than you so I must be doing something for the team"" bullshit. You got 1200 points from picking off four people from the back of the fucking base. Hey guess what

**INFANTRY**

**Switch kits to help your team**

Medic in your squad just gone down? Pick up his kit, drop yourself some ammo, switch back to your old kit to refill it. Tank just killed your engineer friend and no medic in sight? Take his kit and blow that tank up, then switch back if you need to.

* Are you an assault? Drop some ammo

* Are you an engineer? See that damaged vehicle right next to you? It's not trying to suck your dick

* Are you a Recon? Help your team move forward by throwing pokeballs

* Are you a medic? Look around before you revive someone, maybe if you had a mic you could hear them.** 

If you have just revived a guy twice in less than a minute, or he wants to change class to deal with an enemy vehicle. THINK FOR FUCKS SAKE, STOP REVIVING EVERYONE AND THEIR MOTHER FOR EASY POINTS, ESPECIALLY ON DEFENCE. See that tank that just rolled up? A team full of medics and assaults isn't going to fucking beat it, so let me change class when I die.

Once you have all the classes ranked up, there is no need for an engineer on defence on Nelson bay. Choose your class wisely, in other words, stop being a dumbass.

Choose your class based upon the situation. Tank just rolled into your base? Go engineer and blow that shit up. No

If you're using communication and team work you could probably hit it with a tracer dart and have two or three people launch rockets at the same time

**VEHICLES**

Don't take the chopper

**YOU DO NOT, only to be met by my bullets. We then healed the vehicle and sat back and slaughtered the team. Guess what? The same will happen to you if you do this.

I'm not saying don't get out

If you're in a tank, he is saving yours. Two engineers repairing your tank makes you **almost** invincible. The only counter to this is the previously mentioned launch at the same time method of attack. 3 RPG's/Hot carls hitting a tank at the same time will fuck it up even if they have their whole team repairing that shit. You could try to hit them with C4, but like I said, it's just too dangerous. Any tank driver with half a brain knows to keep an eye out for C4 players.

**YOU CAN SPOT PEOPLE WHILE IN A VEHICLE**

If I am a chopper pilot

If you haven't had much experience piloting choppers, but it's also much harder for them to hit the chopper. While they are concentrating on your chopper, they will usually get killed by ground forces.

Again, don't keep changing your direction every few seconds, be consistent. Fly in circles in the same direction and they will get the idea and lead their bullets as such. Fly around in all directions and what the fuck do you expect them to hit?

If you're the UAV pilot

When you spot the UAV, as anyone who isn't a complete retard should be able to take the pilot down.

I don't have much to say about sea vehicles as I don't have much experience using them. Er

I changed the original grid style with basically just a light overlay for an even easier call out for that pesky bushwookie

Battlefield 1943 was my first console shooter and I’m 25, while I don’t really give a shit about stats or rank, believe me when I say you can seriously learn the game and how to kick ass by simply covering a point in Conquest (or defending in Rush). While the ticket bleed is almost non-existent compared to previous BF games, defending a point will always assure that you learn the terrain and have enemies coming to you, instead of having to figure out where the fuck they’re hiding. No matter what you think your skill level is, the biggest difference between you and the enemy is that they know the maps and the controls better. 


* **Don’t stop ‘til you get enough.**

When defending, part of the attacker’s goal is to make you doubt they are attacking. Cover is only going to help them sneak into your base. The wall on that M-Com station is only going to help them hide from your bullets. And believe me, they will get into that building, hole or not. No cover simply means that recon sitting in the back of base, not throwing motion mines or calling in mortar strikes, can shoot the guy before he arms. And I can’t tell you how many extra kills I’ve picked up destroying buildings and putting a shell right between the eyes of some sneaky bastard. If I’m attacking on Arica Harbor and I have a building to hide in, don’t send me a hate message when I flank you and stab half your team.


* **Get down. Shut up.**

There’s a lot you can learn from Lt. Dan, your avatar is. You scream when you kill people. You scream when a grenade flies near you. You scream when someone near you gets sniped. So, get down. SHUT UP. You don’t need to kill everyone you see. You don’t need to throw grenades or pop smoke off next to your position. Just get down. And shut up. I play with surround sound and defend with my ears. You want to sneak past me, gather your squad and come back to knife me later. (When defending or hunting people, throw out a grenade before you rush in. Anyone in the attic/house/bush will scream. I call it the explosive motion mine.)


* **The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat

I never played much Call of Duty, but you don’t have a timer. You can flank your enemy and wait for the rest of the team to attack. You can wait for vehicles to respawn. You can wait until the enemy starts to push into your spawn and use any means to get past them. But when you do attack, try to bring everyone. And in the words of Agent Stansfield, I mean *EVVVVVVVEERRRRRYYYOOONNNNNEEEE*. The reason you are losing is because you’re throwing a predictable amount of guys at predictable intervals at the defenders. You want them to get bored. You want them to get lazy. And then you want to attack them in such a way that it doesn’t give them time to think or time to aim, only time to die. You arm, C4, landmine


* **Aim small

The kill cam is only useful to the enemy when you’re hiding somewhere to get headshots. Get the fuck up on people and introduce bullets into their chest. You do not want to miss people and give them the chance to think. You want them to panic and give them a chance to die. I’m that motherfucker that ran out of cover, all while on my way to your M-Com. Remaining calm and getting a close, clean kill means you don’t have to worry about some recon mortar striking your position. 


* **Let them have B. No

Like I said previously, you want to defend A always. I can’t tell you how many times I come into a game to see a team defending a destructible building, an M-Com next to a stationary AT or that house on Isla that you can drop with a knife. It sucks to lose a point and I don’t suggest dropping it on your own, but the key to defending is being where the enemy is. (Conversely, the key to attacking being where the enemy isn’t.) If you’ve ever had trouble taking a point before, guard that one and leave the other to those two jackbags on your team firing smoke grenades at one another.


* **Mystery points are the best kind of points.**

If you haven’t discovered it already, pick up his kit and throw out a health pack. A recon dies, toss out a motion mine and mortar strike somewhere at random. I don’t recommend picking up an engineer’s kit unless you’re specifically looking for one (or if they have land mines), but hey, I’ve picked up points for an ammo box and repairing a tank at the same time. Points mean unlocks. Points mean your team is doing better than it was before you got said points. And for the love of all that is holy, spot people. You get +20 for someone out of your squad and +30 for someone in your squad killing the guy. And you don’t waste ammo. You don’t have to worry about that guy knifing you. You don’t do anything beyond hitting Q or Back or Select. And those points will just blend into your overall point streak, from all those points you’re picking up from stealing kits. I get the ace pin only because, I’m throwing out land mines


* **Stop using upgraded armor... in anything but the Blackhawk... or unless you're a passenger/gunner.**

You aren’t impressing anyone by surviving two seconds longer in that barrage of rockets, don’t you.) Light tanks, opt for the alt fire or faster reload. The coax in the BMD is great, just aim using the top middle of the T grenade reticule. Faster reload or alt weapons in the Apache/Havok. When using the UAV, skip the alt fire and go for stronger warheads. That crappy machine gun is only going to piss people off and cause them to look for you. You should be spotting and aiming for hard targets, not that guy camping in the concrete building. 

**Ignore this line: I was mistaken.**
Always use smoke while in the Blackhawk. ALWAYS. When someone hits you with a tracer dart
**I've made a huge mistake.**

Armor is As for humvees

**From [troglodyte](http://www.reddit.com/user/troglodyte ""The best source on anything remotely engineer-related.""):**

Armor lets you take a grand total of ONE more of any type rocket. I know this sounds like harping on the same topic, you really do need to keep it alive. Armor won't help that; a teammate will.
As for what to equip on the tank, my ranking on tanks is Reload &gt; Alt Weapon &gt; Damage &gt; Optics &gt; Smoke &gt; Armor, although mostly I use Alt since it's incredibly useful in a lot of vehicles (the coax gun on tanks is actually better than reload if you're not in a ton of tank battles; it's more killy against infantry than the main cannon).


* **Shoot for the tracks or the back of the tank.**

That goes for anyone shooting at the tank. 


* **Ignore the noisy enemy and find the quiet one.**

That sniper in the lighthouse or that Blackhawk flying around without a gunner is only a minor discomfort. Yeah


* **Those mortar strike binoculars are great for spotting.**

And enemies make the little dot in the middle go red

EDIT: Also, for a number of reasons.

1272988143.0,bzz8y,Here is how to use the tracer to guarantee vehicles die.,Cloven,50,8,44,"1) tracers have no bullet drop.  They don't travel super fast

2) once a target is marked, you will see a small dotted-line square appear when you look in the direction of the tank.  

3) center your RPG/CG aim point directly on the square (note: you do not need line of sight.  Just aim at the square.  This takes about 3 seconds to get a missile lock.).

4) now the square is solid and has little numbers underneath telling you how many meters to the target.

5) if it's less than 40 meters, and fire, then pop back into cover.  Note that if you are in front of the tank you are probably going to die; you might want to wait until the tank is otherwise distracted, engaging, or facing a different direction.  Remember hitting the back or flanks of the tank does a lot more damage.

6) If it's &gt; 40 meters, a building, a hill, doesn't matter, as long as the sky is unobstructed for you and the pathway is clear through the sky to the tank, you will get a nice hit.

7) Over 200 meters

8) Reload as fast as you can.  With a CG you are not hurting the tank super bad so you want to try to maximize your DPS to overcome any repairs that are happening to the tank.  Don't just sit there and stare

9) Time the tank's shots.  If the tank doesn't seem to have the Alt Fire option then he doesn't have machine guns.  If he has nobody riding with him, if you run out of ammo, then shoot, wait for him to shoot, and then charge the tank with your (surprisingly effective) repair tool at the ready.  You can cover a lot of ground in 6 seconds and inattentive or busy tanks will often panic.

I understand that they're just doing what the game allows them to, but I also feel it bastardizes the sniping mechanics for which I love Bad Company so much by taking what is normally a skill game and reducing it to one, not necessarily well-aimed bullet (M95), or a spray in the general direction of me and my teammates (VSS).

Some parting thoughts:


* No one ever used the vehicle spec for smoke.  It's the most useful thing in the game for tanks/apc's/helicopters.  Removing tracer darts was amazing.

* I could never fly a helicopter.  Damn was I terrible.  Sometimes I would be playing after a night of drinking and not be able to take off the landing pad.  Imagine piling into a troop transport and having the pilot immediately ditch into the ocean out of bounds -- everyone dies.  It was hilarious

* The map design was excellent. 

* The audio was excellent.  Playing with a surround-sound system with the volume cranked up was always excellent. 

* The weapon/gadget hierarchy is amazing.  Kudos to the designers.  Every gun had a distinct look and feel

* There are no goddamned jets.



One last thing I'd like to mention




* I miss the commander mode.

* I miss prone.

* I miss the variety of classes.  Compare 4 classes to [7 classes](http://wiki.bf2s.com/classes/battlefield-2).

* I miss three factions.



Two more random thoughts.  I noticed not very many people used smoke as assault.  Kind of odd.  And damn did the game need a limit on how many people could play recon and have a sniper rifle.

While still noobing around

Teamwork-centered gameplay with voice chat and squads? It was everything I thought it would be and tons more. I loved the small things, you could arm the 3rd-stage MCOM on the wooden balcony by jumping up and down underneath, hidden by the shadow, and holding ""E."" For the third set of MCOMs on Valparaiso, you could jump onto the ledge on the side of the map and drop down right beside MCOM A. You could arm the B MCOM on the same stage by swimming underneath it, while exposing yourself to danger since you'd start treading water and could no longer shoot. You could go Assault with smoke grenades and fire them at close range to stealthily open up holes in walls, or lobby them into choke points to get your squadmates through safely.

And that AT-4. God damn if this isn't my favorite weapon I've ever used in a game. The learning curve was huge, so you can avoid tracers? As an engineer, do you go AT4 or tracer-RPG with a squadmate to snag a second tracer hit as soon as the heli pilot dropped smoke and disabled the first tracer plant? [Tagging spawn-camping wookies with the tracer also provided tons of fun](http://cloud.steampowered.com/ugc/558654597235623639/DA14F32F09FD4858B558271F6B3AF809A1289FE4/).

When BF3 came out, the small bugs that added tons of depth in strategy (e.g. trying to counter a counter to a bug/map shortcut), the better visibility without lens flare everywhere, the fact that the simpler principles of the game could be much better elucidated and used as a foundation for strategy and tactics. In BFBC2, the game mechanics provided a playground on which you could crawl and run in whichever way you wanted. With BF3, the playground expanded in size but was also suddenly surrounded by a thick fence a foot away from every surface; there were more mechanics to explore, but you were bound to crawling around them instead of simply using them as a foundation on which to base your playstyle. It was like taking a game of chess, but limiting visibility to only one tile around each of your pieces and adding a two-tile choke point to the center of the board--a rocket-spammed zone through which you *have* to pass in order to increase the ""action"" in the game, the /r/bf3 community was a similar experience to joining a CoD forum

I tried going back to BFBC2, like the fact that gun reticles/aim moved with spread, and did not generate a simple cone of fire like they did in BFBC2. And then I went back to BF3, and could only notice a complete lack of the fun and innovation that defined BFBC2.

This, just as* installing *either of them also installs the second*), has made me stop playing either of these games for months now, without even noticing.

**Calibration Trick**

If calibration isn't helping, but don't utilize the full range of the joystick axis, only go 50%, or 75%, or wherever your joystick drops off in-game. Doing the same with the opposing side of the axis may help balance the controls out.  If this works, you should find your sluggish joystick has a much improved sensitivity and 'full' range within the axis or axes.

In Canada there is a regiment called the Governor Generals Foot Guards (GGFG's). They are the regiment you see in Ottawa dressed in those big blacks hats doing drill on Parliamnet Hill or at the Governor Generals Mansion. But they are also a combat regiment (Infantry I think) and the GGFG's will be out doing combat excercises. 

Anyway...years ago on a combat training exercise in Petawawa I think -Petawawa is a huge base North of Ottawa - the GGFG's were out there on an excercise in full kit which included the Carl G. Apparently as the story goes the regiment ""lost"" a Carl G out in the field and a large search was conducted to try and find it.

Ever since then the Governor General's Foot Guards (GGFG's) are un-officially known as the  ""Gotta Go Find Gustavs"" (GGFG's)

To me, tons of vehicles, huge maps, big teams, squad respawning etc., etc.  It's a lot to get used to without wondering what these boxes are and why doesn't this gun shoot anything beside a blinking light?  BC2 is unlike any other modern shooter because it has these features.

So, figure out squad spawning, what walls of buildings blow up, how long mortar fire lasts for, how to deal with bullet drop and a hundred other things.  Learn the things that are common to *all* classes and by the time you figure those out (and probably long before) you'll have unlocked those ""essential items"".

So we've been playing and I was the first to approach level 50 after 400+ hours in game.  Finally last week we're playing and at the end of the round I watch my score creep closer and closer to that magical 50.  We're on a server where our team is getting worked like a white guy at a Korean massage so we decide to server hop.  At the new server, I immediately hear FUCK YOU! over Teamspeak, my friend bitching for me having just killed him and no sooner had the laughter settled when the magical level 50 pin appears on the screen.  Turns out my friend had been the final points that pushed me over.

Bad Company 2 isn't a fragfest game where the best kill-death ratio or most points matters the most.

What makes Bad Company 2 different than so many other FPS games is it's reliance on teamwork and goal achieving congruency. This game isn't about singularity

I find that the ""worst"" players when it comes to killing the enemy often end up being some of the best players for winning the round for a team by helping taking out or defending MCOMs and helping take control or defending bases on Conquest. You can be a perfect shot as a Recon, your only goal should want to either be taking out the MCOM yourself or giving support to your team to protect the MCOM once its charge is set.

On Conquest

Racking up kills and points should be an indirect and secondary goal/objective. If you are actively contributing to winning the match your score should naturally be good

Score and Objective achieving are not mutually exclusive. If you have a great score, your score will most often reflect that.

There are also contributions to the team that don't get you many points, but the faster the enemy gets put down, the faster you can move on to someone else. Spotting is absolutely key. It's of the utmost importance that your teammates know where enemies are if you see them. Spotting may be irritating, but you wouldn't believe how much the tides get turned when everyone is spotting (Obviously this doesn't work too well for Hardcore mode). Even sacrificing yourself or making someone stop to kill you can make a huge difference. You weren't able to kill that guy in the MCOM room, but you managed to delay him long enough for the MCOM to blow up.

Your primary goals should be to help your team achieve objectives and win the round, don't be selfish.

Hopefully I didn't come across as whining or anything of the sort. I thought I'd just explain that this game isn't about being the best on the scoreboard

Edit: 

**TL;DR:** Basing skill on where you are on the scoreboard doesn't necessarily mean anything. You can have the best score, yet end up being the deciding person that got your team the win. Skill should be based on ability to help the team reach its objectives and win the match and not on being on the top of the scoreboard.

How is this calculated?  Simple:  Everyone has a number.  This is not displayed, for example, is 431 at the moment.](http://bfbcs.com/stats_360/Zulu%20Zulu%20Zulu) Every time I am part of a kill (that is, any time I kill another player, or die to another player) my number is plugged into a calculation with their number, and each of ours changes accordingly.  

**If I kill...**

* A lower #'d player: My score goes up a little

* A higher #'d player: My score goes up more

**If I die to...**

* A higher #'d player: My score goes down a little

* A lower #'d player: My score goes down more

This caters to kills-focussed and objective ignoring playing first and foremost and leads to players with a W/L of around [1.75](http://bfbcs.com/stats_360/UDLawman) to be ranked higher in ""skill"" than those who take objectives, base-rape and be all around assholes all in the name of getting enough kills to ensure their status symbol would never go down.

This number can easily be manipulated through focussing on kills rather than objectives

1.  People aren't adaptive, and nobody is spotting/darting tanks, or even attempting to take them out.  (hint, you don't just have to be engie to take one out)  what is even worse is when the enemy has a killer gunship team, they are racking up kills and just making it hell on everybody.  However, nobody seems to be trying to take them out.  I think that baddies must think gunships are the only way to kill gunships.  Heck, I kill them with the tank machine gun all day long, only the dumb ones will continue to fly.

2.  Errryyyybody wants to use the gunship.  Nothing like the enemy having every flag and your spawn has 5 people running around the empty heli pad

3.  God awful pilots.  Of course once one of them takes off, join empty server for 20 min and figure it out)

4.  Tank drivers that think they are rambo.  If somebody wants your tank dead

5.  People that never defend flags, because once they have B they can come at A from 2 directions.  The policy should be defend B all game.  Some maps just have that ONE flag that turns the tide.

6.  Snipers.  I get it sniping is fun, and run around pistoling people in between spots, also they spot EVERYTHING regardless of if they have a shot on it.

7.  When there are 200 people in the bradley.  That thing seats allot of people, you should be thinking, what does my team need most right now?  Should I be killing that tank over there, or is sitting in the bradley with 4 other players really helping out?

for the TLDR types, squad up, watch videos, read guides, and when you feel like you are just getting spanked by the enemy, like they really have their stuff together, take notes,,True,t3_k9x44

* When using C4 or ammo/health crates
* Using a sniperrifle to body shot someone at close range will result in an instant kill.
* High optics and UAV make a very deadly combo. Fly up high into the air
* [here](http://forum.ea.com/eaforum/posts/list/423140.page) is a post detailing on how to change the fov and [here](http://forum.ea.com/eaforum/posts/list/499371.page) is a possible fix for hit detection.
* [here](http://www.bf-games.net/download/2787/gossamers_bad_company_2_launcher.html) is a good tool for modifying everything you need.
* If a medic gets killed, and you will both have your original kits.
* If you hold E as you approach the mcom, jump and fire your weapons while disarming.
* If you are rolling recon
* Pick up kits lying on the floor in order to toss kits around. Will award mass of points and will be good for your team. You can even revive someone if you pickup a med kit. Just revive and pickup your old kit at the same time.
* [here](http://denkirson.xanga.com/722757523/bad-company-2/) is a good list of weapon statistics.
* Repair your teams vehicles - also don't drive off leaving your engie in the middle of the battlefield holding a repair tool.
* Using smoke grenades can remove the tracers off teammates and vehicles, removing that part will remove the tracer.
* Quickswitching for a reload or for shotguns is very useful: It's much easier to tell this in normal mode, the number of ammunition loaded in your weapon will reset during the animation, and the instant that it resets, your weapon is technically loaded and you can shave off a second or so by quickswitching after that reset. Use it especially on rockets, it will save you seconds.
* Throwing a grenade near an enemy will cause them to yell out ""grenade!"" Toss one through the window of a building and listen for screams. When you're an assault taking a conquest flag or guarding an M-COM you just lit
* Every gun has a perfectly accurate first shot
* Watch your map. Watching friends play, take a second and see if you can shoot him.
* If your enemy overflows the circle of your ironsight
* Don't spot in too quick succession
* Collapsed buildings are one of the greatest forms of cover on conquest maps
* If you're assault
* If you're using an ATI card and experiencing long loading times
* Practice using the Ironsights on a gun; an extra grenade



I will add them to the list as they come.

1272501351.0,bxi7f,How to not suck at defending in rush (includes bonus rant).,connery_007,41,5,35,"It has come to my attention that most people are incredibly stupid when it comes to defending MCOM's in rush.  Fortunately

Generally, at which point they'll bail and try to arm.  While this is happening, around half a dozen snipers will be in position and start sniping and mortaring indiscriminately.  Generally, the defensive tactic for most people I've seen is either to run around the island as a medic, firing at helicopters and cowering behind the shed on the top of the hill.  Fast forward a bit and if you haven't lost an MCOM yet, this is where things turn pear shaped.  

The snipers have held the defenders back, people is to attack the attackers.  You won't win a rush game by sitting behind the shed taking pot shots at attackers.  Keeping them off the island completely is paramount, and this tactic goes for any map in the game.  I have lost that many rush games because the entire defensive team finds it easier to sit *behind* the mcom and try to shoot people arming it, rather than securing the perimeter and not allowing the attackers to even be within striking distance of it.  

Back to my example, doesn't mean you can't push forward.

tl;dr summary- When defending:

* Use smoke - barely anybody does
* Motion mines are your friend
* Hold the bases perimeter: sitting at the back of your base
* Letting the enemy control the area in front of the mcom is a recipe for disaster- This is what you are defending first and foremost
* Use common sense.  If you're defending and losing
* Making the attackers fight for every inch of ground will grind their tickets down
* Dammit soldier

I can't begin to count the number of times me or my squad have been the only ones on an entire team actually pushing back against attackers.  Its how you win when you're plaing defence and its phenomenal the number of players who are unwilling to do this.

The main point of this all : you can be a terrible FPS shooter

Don't like videos? Quick summary:

* 'Q' : The magic button. It spots enemies and places that red triangle above them. There is nothing that will help your team out more. If you could only shoot, you should spot. 

* But 'Q' gets better. Need ammo? Point at an assault

* On the same note, whatever. If you are on the foreign language team, the audio queue isn't obvious, you need to look for the flashing icons.. 

* Work with your squad. Try to stay together. Realize your squad is a mobile spawn point

* Understand how tickets work. It is the 'score' of the game and a team loses when it reaches zero. Everytime you die, its best to not respawn and just wait and hope a medic will revive you. 

* In Conquest, slow. You may lose more tickets assaulting a well defended point than you would gain by taking it over. Especially if you can't hold it. The ability to spawn on a control point your team controls is huge. 

* Rush has more complications than conquest. In rush

* Know your kit and your role. I won't elaborate much

-- Assault : Provide ammo. Use smoke grenades to create cover on offense. 

-- Engineer : Repair your teams vehicles. Blow up enemy vehicles. Blow up strong cover points or buildings where enemy is hiding behind. 

-- Medic : Revive dead teammates. Drop medkits where your team is holed up. 

-- Recon : Toss motion mines to reveal enemy movement on mini map. You'll help out a lot on the front lines. If you want to snipe thats cool, if you can just move up a bit into middle territory, you can help out your squad by being an advance spawn point. 

* Death before dismount. Say you drive a tank into the fray and get shot to shit. You hop out of the tank to hide in a building, repair it, and use it against you. Worse, your tank won't respawn back at base until the original is destroyed. This is a bad, bad, bad situation to be in. Unless you are 100% sure your team can get back in the drivers seat, its best to just die in it. Death before dismount.

The RPG seems to do *way* more damage to vehicles, when I had to break it out for anti-personnel. It works with tracers, same as the CG. I suppose the reload speed is slightly slower, but that's an issue with every rocket launcher.

Let me first just say

However
This game can be extremely frustrating to me. 

It's not that it's too hard
OK. Not everyone else but in BC2 I play to win the match and when my teammates start fucking around I get pist.

Things like this bother me:

* Lack of basic vehicle politeness (vehicle stealing
* Players that ignore objectives completely
* Players that won't spot
* Squadmates that enjoy putting the worst music in the world on teamspeak.
* M95-ers with 12x scopes that hide in the same bush the entire match.
* Lack of tactics (entire team attacking the same flag)
* ...

Does anyone else feel this way? When I play CoD I couldn't care less if my team was full of idiots but here it just gets to me but you know
