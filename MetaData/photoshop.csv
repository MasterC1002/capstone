1362677947.0,19ut2z,I'm sick of Dove making Photoshop synonymous with the reshaping of the human body and this time they specifically called out r/photoshop,Mentalinertia,273,37,68,"Dove has started a nice little campaign targeting Art Directors and graphic designers specifically they called out the /r/photoshop community by posting this [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/photoshop/comments/19cr2a/a_free_photoshop_action_best_used_with_portratis) containing links to a downloadable action here about a week ago. 


Then going ahead and creating this [Youtube ad](http://youtu.be/m0JF4QxPpvM) criticizing those who use photoshop as trying to distort the beauty of women. What's worse is it's insulting to the craft to say that an artist can be reduced to an action, make-up, and scenery to make the subject look their best. If Dove doesn't want anyone to manipulate our sense of perfection maybe they should refrain from letting their models use make up.

This whole campaign is a farce how many designers could they have possibly reached if they started this whole thing a mere 7 days ago. Its just a cheap stunt.

All this Corporate activism drives me crazy all Dove has done is create a false sense of 'good' guys vs the 'bad' guys when in reality the only reason they have this campaign is because it sells not because they are a good company. All The Dove real women campaign while successfully selling more Dove products has done little to widen the stereotypical views of beauty and is only paying some lip service to the problem. Not to mention that their ads were Photoshoped.

Dove. Owned by Unilever. Same company that owns AXE. Brands that sell their product by presenting it with highly Photoshopped bikini-clad women.

Maybe they should stop manipulating the media

Some articles already circulating about their new campaign.

Just my rant.

By your logic, you are insulting the collective intelligence of your consumer base who are smart enough to know that any large brand marketing campaign, including yours will feature professionally photographed and post processed models.

To infer that your own models and advertising does not feature any sort of professional image production and post production is disingenuous, can see there has been post processing work to the skin complexion and lighting from the RAW image in your advertising campaigns, albeit without judicious use of Photoshop’s Liquify tool.

If you’re looking for someone to blame

Photoshop is used by millions every day in millions of applications that have nothing to do with engendering a false perception of beauty.

Now I can make all the hokey money and Wall Street Journal illustrations I want!

1. First ramp up the contrast/brightness to eliminate most of the background and the subject's inner color. You want clean outlines and dark shadows.

2. Then do a black/white lines halftone

3. then play with the threshold or contrast until the background/grays are faded out (it may need some erasering around the edges of your subject).

4. Then use some subtle Glass or Ripples to give it a little shaky-hand.

5. Blur to taste. Totally optional.

6. Layer on top of your choice of paper texture (or not) with a different layer opacity style (of course). I think I used Darken or Multiply

Put in the oven and bake for 620 degrees for six hours. Rinse and repeat. Honestly the whole thing requires a bit of tinkering,False,self,t5_2qhcb,1351890990.0,,,t3_12j87s

It's basically a highlight carving rig where you use two curves to do lights and darks and then a gray card to polish off the difference.  You can use multiples rigs in multiple stages as well.

* Do you prefer that people try on their own and then ask for help when they get stuck?

* What do you want out of this community?


**UPDATE**: 


Alright. I've added a box in the sidebar for right now. Basically what most of you want is for people to have tried and failed before they ask for help. Most people don't mind the ""my X died and I need this retouched/colored for Y."" I will be letting that kind of request thru. If I see commercial requests, or ""my boss wants me to X.""


**UPDATE 2**:


I am in the process of taking over /r/PhotoshopRequests for the purpose of photoshop requests that are 100% free work. Help when you get stuck will still be here in the main community.

There is no way, so I kept the coating on the bottom.

 If anyone had looked at the noise/grain in the image they would have seen this. Unfortunately no one bothered for more advanced techniques other than levels and 3D ( which is based on brightness levels anyway ).

##How it is done
* Create new layer
* Set layer to difference
* Add slight gaussian blur ( just to very slightly start noticing lines and noise
* use Cntr,E ( to duplicate visible as new layer )
adjust Levels to brighten it up.

What you'll notice by doing this correctly is that the noise/grain has a pattern. which is consistent throughout the image including that AmA paper

Including the above method

**TL;DR** It is actually a lot harder even for a professional to have faked the original image.

I used the spot healing and clone stamp for most areas... especially on repairing the bottom of the pillar where I had to pretty much guess how it looked.

So my main question is what can I do about the floor? I got totally lost... I was actually thinking about finding carpet stock at the right angle and editing it in there.


Another spot I was having trouble with is the hair and forehead area... I didn't want to use too much blur since too much blur makes it look too edited... and I didn't want to lose much sharpness.

After I was mostly complete here... I just ran it through Alien Skin Image Doc - JPEG Repair

I code professionally - so loops and things I'm ok with...

I've been having a lot of problems trying to get the API commands together in a Photoshop scripting language to produce an animation then save it out as a GIF.

I know there's two kind - layer, and keyframes itself, without needing to interface with Photoshops own animation timeline - so I guess the layer animation will be easier.

What I need is something like 4 input parameters:    
1: Number of frames.    
2: Number of layers per frame.    
3: Dimensions


In random pseudo code

---------------------

1: Create as many layers as : the animation is long X number of layers per frame. (e.g. 20 frames

2: Create a new ""animation"" thing... that links 3 layers at a time to a single animation frame. (This is the Animation window in the GUI, and each one has an attribute like ""Delay"" for it...)

3: Loop around all 60 layers

4: In each iteration, and the various load/paste image tools at ones disposal.     
Even write pixels to the image

5: Save it out to a GIF

---------------------

I probably have the pseudo code wrong in the way the animation is linked to the frames?

Could anyone point a way to any online tutorials?

Thaaaaanks!

Lot's of other research is people just saying ""you can't animate a PNG, IE and Firefox so it can't be a .APNG, can it?

.gif isn't an option

Any advice would be appreciated. It's just flat out bugging me now

1351785547.0,12gnpf,[Plz Help!] Inking in Photoshop CS5 almost unmanageable- Strange radiating circle emits from cursor when clicks and doesn't allow for pen pressure,jessej07,16,3,5,"**edit: If what I start to describe below sounds like an issue you are having

I'm hoping someone else has ran into (and fixed) this problem.

I typically ink my line art with a 3 pt standard round brush by using the pen tool and then stroking the path.  When I do free hand with my tablet I use the same brush but just up it to 4 pt which lets me match the 3 pt done by the pen tool.

For some reason when I fired up Photoshop today my tablet and Photoshop are being strange and for some reason every now and then when I start to draw a line freehand it will begin with a standard regular click (like a mouse did it) and just do a full 4 pt dot

Every now and then I can draw a line like I'm used to

Whenever it happens a quick flash of a circle emits from the point of contact (I guess to just show ""this is clicking here"") which seems like a nice feature

Here it is sort of in action http://i.imgur.com/ES84R.jpg  Ignore the color picker

I use a Tooya Pro cheap tablet that has been perfectly fine until just this morning.

Edit: I should note that when the problem occurs

* Regular begin the drag of my pen like I always do
* Radiating circle emits from the cursor and a full 4 pt dot is plotted

* Dragging my pen is sometimes a continuation from the full 4 pt dot and the entire line is 4 pts and doesnt change with pressure/lack of pressure

or

* Dragging my pen draws a line like I usually do but the base of it is a full 4 pts whereas the line I'm drawing fluctuates with pressure.

* when I want to undo what just happened it is usually 2 steps

Edit: This seems to be related http://glennmerdan.com/2010/05/18/wacom-tablet-windows-7-circle-clicks-fix/ but I can't do the fix with Windows Home.  So it appears it is a Windows problem likely caused by an  update.  Any idea on fixing?

btw credit for the pic in my examples goes to samma_cha on flickr

__________________________________________________________________________

Open your picture in photoshop and select the pen tool - http://i.imgur.com/rIop4.jpg 

Also

Now, it will create a little box called an anchor point.  you can lay down a series of these anchor points which will be connected, like this: - http://i.imgur.com/Prddd.jpg

Notice that I'm zoomed in close to help see where the edge of the doll is.  Anyway

Make sure your foreground color is black

Your path should fill with a transparent red color

Right-click the image again, filled in with red.  Now go back into normal mode(the button next to the 'quickmask mode').  You should get a 'dancing' dotted line around your object.  Now go to the top menu and 'select &gt; inverse' - http://i.imgur.com/LjGD5.jpg

And then 'new layer via copy' - http://i.imgur.com/LjGD5.jpg

You now have your object on a separate layer

Now you can do whatever you want with the object, let's change the background to black &amp; white.  Make sure you have the background layer selected and press 'ctrl' and U on your keyboard.  This will bing up the hue/saturation settings.  Turn the saturation slider all the way to -100, like so - http://i.imgur.com/6hZZm.jpg

Click 'ok'

Set the Source to 'Pattern' instead of the default 'Sampled'. Now create a new file at 10x10 pixels (I suppose 1x1px could work, select all (ctrl-a) and go to edit&gt;define pattern. Call it 'white'.
Now select this pattern in the Healing Brush
It doesn't blur untill you stop painting, which I personally find to be a plus.

One downside is that it doesn't work on masks (despite those just being b/w images...)

For those who've tried it, making it easy to create both small and large blurs.

http://m.artician.com/pu/JB6H2G37SWGRWC5QGEI3LSMBBFQDT2BF.preview.jpeg

http://www.flickr.com/photos/isaacpacheco/4873822003/

I have done it before by manually removing the backgrounds of the upper layers.

What I was wondering was if there is a simpler way to do this. Or to put it in noob terms is there a ""compare similarities between layers and remove all those similarities but the bottom layer"" way to do this.

Thanks for any help you guys can offer.

Well I don't know why Photoshop is stupid like this, when drawing or transforming a vector shape. This works, but it's hard when you're working with a small shape with a 1px stroke that you want to tweak ever so slightly. At 100% zoom, a 100px x 100px rectangle isn't very big on screen.

So I did some more searching and found that you can stop Photoshop from being stupid like this:

* turn on the grid (cmd/ctrl+' or view&gt;show&gt;grid)
* make sure snap to grid is turned on (view&gt;snap to&gt;grid)
* Making the grid lines at 1px increments is a good idea also: preferences&gt;grids, or 1 and 0 would probably work)
