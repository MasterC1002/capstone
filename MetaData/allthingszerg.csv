I see this kind've hyper aggression over and over and over again. This zerg flew into my base

This used to work. This is what you're all used to. Terran's pushed back into his base getting owned and then we GG.

BUT this is HotS now, the easier these parade attacks are to hold. SO if you continue to throw units at us at the same numbers and the same upgrades and the same composition and we keep getting out mines, each attack will be easier and easier to hold until your units lost totals much higher than ours.

You don't get to just kill terran's outright anymore. What you can still do is get a bunch of damage done and then tech up. I've played multiple games like the one you see here where I FINALLY get to leave my base and I don't see ultra infestor ling bling muta. WHY didn't this guy I'm playing ever get upgrades/ultras.

Listen guys, like 15, force some turrets and make us panic to make marines then have ultras out when we push out on the map you just win.

We aren't an easy matchup anymore where you just fungal us and it's game over. You have to tech to broodlords or ultras and you probably want infestors too. I know it's not THAT easy, literally every matchup I play is won or lost on the ability of the zerg to recognize when he's done enough damage to fall back and tech or if he thinks he can just kill me and lets me claw back into the game.

GET TO HIVE AND BEAT ME IN THIS GAME PLEASE!!! Every fast hive game I play is like an insta win for zerg. Every game where they try to overwhelm me with muta/ling/bling I play my heart out to win and then they come here and QQ about how mines are sooooo good. Well of course they are against lair tech

GET. ULTRAS. PLEASE. I want to feel good if I beat you

- cheese: Any pool lower than 10
- Pool first: 14/15 pool or 14 gas 14 pool or 15 pool 16 gas
- hatch first: 14/15/16 hatch
- 10pool
- overpool

That said

- hatch first &gt; pool first (edit: This is apparently very much debatable

---

- pool first &gt; 10pool
- pool first &gt; overpool
- pool first &lt;-&gt; cheese (debatable

---

- overpool &gt; hatch first
- overpool &gt; cheese
- overpool &gt; 10pool

---

- 10pool &gt; hatch first
- 10pool &gt; cheese
- 10pool drone all in &gt;&gt; hatch first

---

- cheese &gt;&gt; hatch first
- cheese &lt;-&gt; pool first

I'm using '&gt;' to indicate a build order advantage '&lt;-&gt;' to indicate both are roughtly on similar footing and it's going to come down to control and micro and '&gt;&gt;' to indicate a winning advantage, you should always be able to win and end the game there.

First thing that becomes apparent, the pool first, against cheese you auto lose, against overpools and 10pools you may not immediately die, but you will lose so much mining time and drones that in practice, the attacking player will come out ahead with a worker lead.

The obvious hing I want to look at is the 10pool, however, against overpool the disadvantage is of course extremely small, in my experience, against pool first the advantage is no more than pool first against hatch first and at the pro level you often see 10pooling players exit the initial skermish against pool first with a drone lead, which I think is very much attainable if your zergling control is superior to his drone micro. I indeed often ascertain a drone lead from 10pools versus pool first.

However, you can send all but 3 of your drones with it, build 2 spines at his shit, I do not believe it is ever possible to hold that without the 10pooling player screwing up in some way. If you believe otherwise please, give a replay, but I have never seen it at the pro level or on the ladder and IdrA agrees with this assesment (yeah, I know, but I take his authority over people here unless a replay that disputes this can be post).

So basically, the disadvantage against overpool is quite small. It cannot be automatically beaten by anything, and with proper scouting it automatically defeats hatch first. Hatch first only nets you an advantage against one build and can be automatically defeated by many. In that sense, 10pool is not taking a risk at all, it is one of the safest openers whereas hatch first is taking a major risk. Pool first might be the safest opener, but isn't capable of directly killing anything although it could be argued that if you hold of cheese with this you're basically in a winning advantage whereas you aren't per se with 10pool, but holding cheese without any losses with a 10pool is very easy.

So that's why I feel that statistically in ZvZ on the ladder, but in reality it is the safest and dare I say least coin flippy way to play ZvZ. Hatch first is flipping a coin, not 10pool.",,False,,t5_2tkq6,,http://www.reddit.com/r/allthingszerg/comments/ztbjn/should_you_always_go_10pool_zvz_on_the_ladder/

Sorry that I didnt link it originally!


Leenock vs Naniwa Game 1:

15hatch

16pool

16gas

@100 gas

3rd queen immediately at natural

6:00 double evo

1/1 ups when evos done (~7:00)

7:30 3rd base, 4th queen

8:30 3rd &amp; 4th gas

9:00 macro hatch

9:40 2/2 upgrades

10:00 hive

10:20 triple infestor

11:00 5th + 6th gas

12:30 3/3

13:00 4th base

13:40 chitenous plating

~15:00 Ultralisk push hits protoss

Notes:

- Leenock did 15hatch blindly as a slight metagame to the gateway openers Naniwa was doing all tournament long. Usually you should 15pool instead to be safe vs some early rushes.

- Use zerglings to defend all early pushes

- Seems weak vs sentry immortal 2base allin

- Dont wait for max with ultras

- Bring queens with ultra army when pushing near max for transfuses. Creep spread helps!

- Bring 2-3 infestors purely for the snare effect of fungals

- Don't rely on infestors to defend anything

- No need for pathogen glands

- Use lings as a mineral dump for constant scouting and counter attacks. They become less useful as the game draws on

- If you go pool first instead and grab the gas at 20


Weaknesses:

- There are timings protoss can hit before ultras spawn to snipe bases and weaken the zerg lategame

- Not entirely clear if all early gateway timings can be held with lings only

- If protoss turtles until max

- Not the easiest micro when you have to fungal and transfuse at same time

- Queens off creep can be picked off easily if out of position

- Not many fungals banked up for the push. If you miss your fungals


Strengths:

- The ultras hit at a really strong timing around 14-15 mins where the protoss wont have a maxed army.

- Transfuses heal a rediculous amount on low hp ultras",,t5_2tkq6,1367203177.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/allthingszerg/comments/1d9f6s/heres_the_zvp_ultralisk_build/

1368574314.0,1ecji1,The reactive mentality,iWearNoHat,60,6,19,"Hello good users of /r/AllThingsZerg!

**Introduction**  
~~~~~~~~~~~  
My name is Aaron

I'm a Master League player that wants to teach you a bit about the reactive mentality of playing Zerg. I've found that once you have a grasp on the right ideas to playing a reactive style

**Playing reactively does NOT limit your options**  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  

The first thing that I want to comment about is the pre-conceived notion that playing reactively means that you must play defensively. This is not true whatsoever. I prefer a ling aggression heavy style myself. Many people feel that when you're told to play reactively, that means that they'll have less units defending their base, and you can reactively harass your opponent!

**How do I react?**  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Second, ""Aaron, how do I know how to react?"". You NEED TO SCOUT. SCOUTING TELLS YOU WHAT YOU NEED TO REACT TO. To keep it simple, you learn proper reactions by trying things and just learning from experience, but as a very basic way of thinking, keep the following fact in your mind while you play. In SC2, there are 3 things that your opponent can be spending their money on. That's army, and economy. It's only safe to be doing 2 at a time, you can learn a lot with seemingly very little information. Just do your best to figure out what your opponent is spending money on. For example, you should match exactly what they're spending their money on. The way that Zerg macro works

**How do I use this logic to improve?**  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  

Well, or poor control during the engagement. If you know that your engagement went alright, then it must be that you had the wrong reaction. If you get  hit with an all in and you aren't prepared, then you didn't scout. If you scout an all in coming, then naturally you can prepare for it properly. For example, if you're playing a ZvZ, and they are doing some kind of mass ling all in, then you can simply also start massing lings.

**TL;DR Army, scout and find out which 2 your opponent is doing. Lose games and learn about how you could have reacted better.**

Now I should mention my own bias: I first learned SC2 by repeating the 10-pool in team games, and 4v4s using the same build, with different variations and transitions of course.  I can say that without a doubt, this was the time when I experienced the most rapid improvement in fundamental mechanics - multitasking, injects, hotkeying/control grouping, rallying Zergling micro


When I started moving onto 1v1s more competitively, and I didn't yet have the mechanics to manage four saturated bases and late-game armies with multiple control groups, and for that reason I wasn't improving.  Either I would die to some early timing attack, or I would reach my ideal 70-80 drone economy without being able to effectively put it to use.  


That was until I saw some unorthodox replays of JulyZerg and Nestea and a few others - that's when I started using 1-base and 2-base all-ins/timing attacks, 2 base roach/ling, 2 base baneling, even weird things like spine crawler rushes.  I experimented more and more with these ""all-in"" attacks, and found that many of the builds that I thought were ""all-in"" could be transitioned out of. Even in some games where I did these attacks and did absolutely no damage, I would always, always, another timing attack
http://www.twitch.tv/tangsc/c/2000201


There would also be so many games where I'd open with say a 1-base baneling all-in against Protoss, some of them I transitioned and won. And that's why I think that the whole notion of an ""all-in"" is a bit arbitrary in Starcraft2 - all top-level aggressive players have a follow-through for every attack, no matter how much of a commitment the attack is.


I even made it to Grandmaster when it was released without using a single ""standard"" macro build.  Now


When Lowko said that all players need to learn a standard macro style for all match-ups, I think it's very reasonable for a brand-new Bronze player to learn a 1-base all-in as a first step, and branch out into more economical timings that allow for transitions.


TL;DR - To learn SC2 via ""all-ins"", but arguably the best way to improve.

I stream my play almost every day (ladder on all servers, commentate my play, and take suggestions for builds or pretty much anything straight from the stream chat. I have a typical viewership of 8-10 people but sometimes I rise up to 20 or 30.


Over the next few days I hope to increase those numbers. I will be streaming most of the day and night today

As I said at the beginning of the post, replay analysis on or off stream, and playing others low level accounts to show what to look for and how to react.


I am launching up my stream for the day right now

Some things people might be interested in is my zvp.  I play zvp different then other zergs and have been since hots beta.  I use swarmhosts

My late game zvp should be of special note to zerg players who struggle versus late game protoss and anyone who thinks late game voidray/templar/colossi/etc is unbeatable should watch some of my late game zvp in these replays.

In the zvz's you will see mainly cheese whether it's from me or my opponent there aren't many straight up macro games.  You will see some zvz's where I go muta into swarmhost as I feel this is going to be super powerful in zvz in the future as I do think going muta into swarmhost is going to be really powerful.

1369125388.0,1er5bj,Don't like muta vs muta? Try the upgraded ling style. It works.,Phoenixed,48,9,53,"**INTRODUCTION**

You probably have read some threads on TL or saw streamers experiment with it. As a high diamond I tried it myself, the opponent went roach hydra... My ZvZ is 75%.

The gist of the strategy: getting fast 1/1 melee upgrades and flooding the opponent with zerglings from 2 bases to get map control and to deny mutalisk player’s 3rd base while saturating yours. This followed by 2/2 and eventually 3/3 army of ultras/hydras/infestors for sealing the deal. Then load a replay and watch units lost tab. You’ll be surprised.

The build assumes other player is going mutalisks. If he’s building roch/hydra instead
***

**THE PLAN**

1. It’s your personal preference whether to go **Hatch-Gas-Pool** or **Gas-Pool-Hatch**. Either way it’s a good idea to also get a **spine** and extra **queens**.
2. If you suspect an attack incoming
3. So you’re mining gas. If you want a faster timing attack – get **2 evos** and **1/1** first, then @ 100 gas.
4. In any case
5. When upgrades are on the way and you have saturated both bases
6. Take a **3rd**
7. Attack as soon as 1/1 is done. Opponent’s spire will usually be done by now, spawning pool, upgrading evos. Keep injecting, making lings and some drones. If you see mutas, get few **spores** at each base, continue producing  **queens**.
8. If you started lair right after upgrades
11. A **4th base** when you start to stockpile minerals. You should have been spreading creep towards it to be able to spore it up.
12. By the time hive is complete
13. Upon seeing your late-game army, fungal mutas. With 3 armor, your hydras will be able to tank a lot of muta shots.
14. Rebuild on **ultra** **ling** because even *if* your hydras are dead


**NOTES**

* **You must not let opponent take a 3rd base.** At least not until you have yours saturated.
* Punish him whenever mutas leave the base. Realize that **it’s you who has the map control** because of your faster army. While muta player must stay defensive lest he dies to counterattacks. Keep splitting your lings between all his bases. For him it will be a pain to deal with.
* Spreading creep is important
* If he reacts correctly with brood lords: get a spire, overlord speed, drops, and lots of zerglings. Base trade if necessary.
* If you find out that he is going roaches, because he won’t be able to leave until his +2 finishes and/or he has a critical mass of roaches. But by the time he does, you should have swarm hosts for defense. Get +1 range and +2 armor, continue with the plan from there. You can also research burrow and try to get lucky.

**EXAMPLES**

Grandmaster zerg Lowko showcasing the beginning on Youtube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CJvWurDO_Y

My [replays](http://cl.ly/P6JF) (first two include hive tech). Watch the units lost tab:

* Derelict Watcher – He can’t take his 3rd base all game long. Deathball arrives and his 26 mutas only manage to kill 6 of 21 hydras before dying.

* Newkirk – He loses even with stronger economy which he had after his baneling attack. Secures his 3rd only when I already started my 4th. Ultras come and stomp everything.

* Zerus Prime – just dire consequences of going all-muta...

***

**HOW TO PLAY AGAINST THIS?**

Depends on what you were doing. Scouting is the key. If you see no gasses at natural

**The standard - Mutalisks**:

* Drop everything and get **+1 melee ASAP** because +1 banelings one-shot any zergling

* **+1 ground armor** is also good to keep your lings competitive. You won’t miss that 1.5 muta anyway. In fact

* Wall off your natural.

* **Cancel your 3rd base** because you won’t be able to hold to it. Really, then you’ll lose all your drones too.
* Only when you get +1 melee (or a lot of mutas) you can begin taking your 3rd again. 
* Don’t leave your base with mutas until you have +1 banelings.
* Either build mutas and try to break him or tech to greater spire and **brood lords**. Or you may try to wall off completely and trade bases.

**The classic - Roach/hydra:**

* Wall off your natural.

* Roach timing attack with at least **+1 range** is good
still tank 3 roach shots.

* If your +1 range wasn’t started yet

* Take your 3rd base protected by roaches.

* Build **roaches**

* Siege up his base closest to you while leaving some defenses at home. Try to kill overseers with hydras.

* You can sprinkle in some **infestors** for fungals

* **OR** you can skip swarm hosts and do a doom drop because there will be nothing to stop it.


**The mirror – Upgraded ling/baneling:**

* Old school ling/bling wars into ultras.

1368361085.0,1e6hlz,Breakdown of each unit for Bronze/Silver players,MynameisIsis,40,7,28,"This was originally meant to be a comment reply

Zergling - Requires spawning pool. Extremely cheap in minerals, and early game defense. When in conjunction with ultras or hydras, can lock down the opponent's army (run past them then a-move) and tank some damage. Can be put underneath mutas to tank enemy muta bounce shots. Units that can attack air and ground prioritize ground, useful especially when the opponent's anti air is just stalkers. When upgraded with melee attack and the attack speed upgrade at hive tech, decimates mineral lines in seconds.

Baneling - Requires baneling nest. Can be built at hatch tech but speed is researched at lair tech. Morphed from a zergling. One-shot high aoe damage unit that explodes when it attacks or dies. Does not deal friendly damage. Expensive on gas and larvae. Great against clumped up units, counters zerglings and marines, busts down walls at the front. 

Queen - Requires spawning pool. Built from the hatchery, will spawn additional larvae after 40 seconds. A queen will have enough energy to do this once every 40 seconds with no energy to spare. 2)spawn creep tumor - A creep tumor ""builds"" in 15 seconds after which it is permanently burrowed and spreads creep within a range of 11. Creep allows zerg buildings to be built upon it and increases the movement speed of most zerg units including enemy zerg. Tumors also provide vision but not detection. Can spawn another creep tumor after it finishes building. As long as the leading edge of tumors hasn't been killed, you can cover the entire map with creep with just a few tumors. 3) Transfuse - heals a target biological unit or building for 125 health. Used on high health units like ultras or on other queens and roaches to defend early game pushes. Uses: early game defense, creep spread, macro in the form of larvae injects. You should have one at each of your first few hatcheries. 

Roach - Requires roach warren. Can be built at hatch tech but needs lair tech to research upgrades, fairly cheap unit that is ranged, but has a short range. Only attacks ground. Uses: A-move unit that has alot of hp for its cost, protects the rest of your army by being up front, great against gateway units and zerglings. Falls off lategame, gas-heavier units perform better but gets you through the midgame. 

Hydralisk - Requires hydralisk den which requires lair. Squishier than the roach but deals more damage and has more range. Can shoot up and down. Susceptible to aoe due to low health; often paired with roaches or zerglings to protect them while they do their damage. Gas heavier than the roach, low hp dps a-move unit. Counters enemy air very well. 

Mutalisk - Requires spire which requires lair. Flying harass unit. Has great speed and regenerates health much faster than other units, battlecruisers, and protoss air (unless they're clumped up). Unlike other harass units, it is still good at direct engagements, but is very squishy. Exponentially more powerful the more you have. Uses: harassing enemy worker lines, scouting/controlling the map, sniping tech bulidings/proxy pylons

Corruptor - Requires spire which requires lair. Flying air superiority unit. Only shoots air units but does high damage to them. Expensive on gas but fairly tanky. Can cast corruption on an enemy unit which debuffs them to take 20% more damage for 30 seconds, battlecruisers, and broodlords. Can morph into broodlords (described later) Uses: Anti-air unit, useless against anything else. Do note that void rays beat corruptors even though corruptors are supposed to beat other air units. 

Infestor - Requires infestation pit which requires lair. Squishy spellcaster unit with no attack. Very gas expensive. Only unit other than roach that can move while burrowed. Needs no additional upgrade beyond burrow to do so. Upgrades are increased starting energy (recommended if you are making more than a couple of infestors) and neural parasite. Has three abilities: 1)Fungal growth - shoots a projectile that then explodes, requires 5 seconds to hatch from their egg during which they are vulnerable. 3)Neural Parasite - takes control of an enemy unit for 15 seconds, during which the infestor cannot move or make any other actions. Must be researched before being used. Not used very often anymore, too expensive/risky/innefficient. Uses: Control enemy position and deal damage with fungal, tank and deal damage with infested terrans, and take control of expensive units with neural parasite during battle. 

Swarm Host - Requires infestation pit which requires lair. Expensive unit. Ground siege unit that has no attack of its own, low health, can only shoot down, but deal massive amounts of damage. Swarm hosts require detection to be seen by the opponent while buried, but are vulnerable between waves of locusts. Unburrow them and run if you see an attack coming, or protect them with your other units. Can upgrade locust duration time. Uses: Siege unit, not meant to directly engage. Keeps the enemy pinned inside their base and can slowly wittle them down with locusts

Viper - Requires hive but no secondary structure. Flying spellcaster unit with no attack. Very expensive on gas and expensive on supply. Has three abilities: 1)Consume - deals 200 damage over 20 seconds to a friendly building to regain 50 energy over the same amount of time. Allows vipers to quickly regain energy and lets you keep less of your supply tied up in units that cannot attack. 2)Abduct - Pretty much, hydras, and protoss ground armies. Double edged sword, be careful and don't walk into it. Uses: Snatches high value units out of the enemy army, such as colossi, thors, and tanks

Ultralisk - Requires ultralisk cavern which requires hive. Immensly expensive on minerals, but oh so worth it. Has a range of 1, which means it's effectively melee but can attack behind a line of lings. Can only attack ground. Attacks splash to nearby units in a 180 arc. Very high dps, very tanky. Cannot be snared, stunned, or mind controlled, and destroys forcefields when walking through them. In other words, making the ultra very very tanky. Uses: A-move frontline unit

Broodlord - Requires greater spire, gas, supply, and time. Vulnerable to attacks especially from air, since it cannot attack up and is very slow, but deals very high damage to ground units. Uses: Siege unit, not meant for direct engagements. As an attack, they'll be trading their units that cost money for your free ones. Late game unit that supplements your army.

EDIT: After feedback

Overlord - No building requirement. Provides eight supply, unless they retreat to unpassable ground, such as a cliff or empty air (at least against ground units). Overlords have two researchable upgrades, speed, at hatch tech, and the ability to transport units, at lair tech. Speed is becoming more common to research in the midgame due to the other race's increased ability to take out stray overlords in HotS, due to its relatively high cost and low utility compared to mutas or nydus worms (discussed in a moment). Overlords can poop creep at will after lair tech; this has no cost or cooldown, can still sit in the unpassable ground behind/outside of their base to watch for expansions and possible tech. Overlords with speed are often sacced into the opponent's main as the mid game begins to find out their tech path so zerg can counter it. They can be spread out along the edges of the map to watch for drops, and just generally be a badass. http://imgur.com/toWG8jY

Overseer - Requires lair. Morphed from an overlord. Requires small amount of gas. Overseers provide the same amount of supply and have the same health as overlords. They are speedy without the need for speed to be researched, they are detectors. That means they can detect cloaked and burrowed units, and are the zerg's best method of detection. As an added plus, most units that can cloak can't attack overseers! Next, overseers can spawn changelings. Changelings last two and a half minutes and upon coming close to an enemy unit, transforms into a basic unit of that race and switches color to that opponent's color. Enemy units don't auto attack changelings unless they have detection. If you can get a changeling with the opponents army without them noticing, it's free scouting on their army's position for 2:30! However, a lone zealot or a marine in a mech army wandering around their main base is a dead giveaway. Lastly, or production buildings

Nydus Worm - Requires nydus network which requires lair. Nydus worms are not a unit per se, allowing near instant travel to far flung corners of the map. A nydus worm can be destroyed and the units ""inside"" are safe, so long as the nydus network is still alive. Uses: Getting around the map in an instant, putting one in a mineral line to attack with zerglings while your army attacks the front, reinforcing far flung bases (opponent brings her whole army to kill a hatch, load up all drones in the nydus to save them, or send your army through to intercept hers) ",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/allthingszerg/comments/1e6hlz/breakdown_of_each_unit_for_bronzesilver_players/
1366549118.0,1csps4,Tip for lower ranked players - Make more queens,Noobymcnoobcake,40,3,16,Queens are great units. They are T1 and only cost minerals so are a very good mineral dump Zerg are often floating on too many minerals anyway. 2 Queens can easily take out early oracles/void rays/banshees because of the transfuse ability. A few queens with a spine wall are very effective at holding any early pressure because of transfuse. They don't cost larve so if you have spare minerals - Make a few. Also I have noticed lower ranked players (myself included) never spread enough creep. Creep spread is a vital part to zerg stratergy. Queens are also very useful late game as they can transfuse ultralisks or broodlords to keep your push going much longer.  try incoeperating more queens into your builds and you will see the results,t5_2tkq6,True

It is a amazing composition at high levels, you just don't have the APM.  

The thing is, which means they have to be controlled.  So what ends up happening is either, my opponent slips on control and the mutas fly into a direct engagement with my hydra ball and die...or, they attempt to harass but slip on macro and I win that way.

I think a lot of lower level zergs would do a lot better by focusing on macro and using units that don't require a lot of APM to be cost effective. It's so easy to a-move with a roach/hydra army, and they die.

*Obviously this formatting isn't great

Hey guys, and a build that works fantastically against it!
I’ve seen a bunch of Aussie zergies here doing quick little bios so I figured this would be an ideal opportunity to tell you a bit about myself before I jump into the guide.



**Bio:**

I’m an English Zerg living in Japan/NZ. Family lives in Japan, to passive strong macro builds. I plan on writing guides every so often for /r/starcraft and /r/atz, specifically focusing on ZvP which I regard as my specialty. I’m in the process of writing a ZvP Ultra Bane guide, but due to being a bit sick I’ve put it on hold. This is a fair bit shorted to write out than that as it’s just a 4 min period of the game ^.^.
At present I don’t stream, streaming all hours! I hope you enjoy reading this guide, and together we can become Zerg bosses.



**The beginning:**

First of all, 66 drones, as we’ll be using all our gasses to get as much vespene out as possible. 
Now for the basis of a standard ZvP opener

It’s common knowledge nowadays that Immortal Sentry pushes out at 8:50 ideally



At 8 mins you have to start pumping lings, I go Ultra bane in ZvP so it goes down then anyway, if you overlord scout, you can throw it down reactively in response to Immortal Sentry.

http://tldr.me/1q0tt3g.png



**The middle:**


Upon seeing the push moving out, and continue to produce these. Don’t make more lings once the Immortal Sentry has pushed out, you need those minerals elsewhere.



With your first wave of lings that you made

http://tldr.me/13vytw2.png

What should you be killing (In order of priority)

1.	The Cybercore

2.	The Probes

3.	The Production

4.	The Nexus

http://tldr.me/ucpdrd.png



Why the Cybercore? Being the crafty fucker I am



**The end:**


Due to the fact that we’ve been mining gas off 3 bases for a significant amount of time, 7 stalkers, 3 sentries and maybe a zealot fighting into a wall of 10+ spines, and your mutas. Of course if you haven’t had enough time to get a WALL of spines, so maybe only 6 or so, just send your mutas to try and base trade right away.




When the push gets to your spine wall




So just a quick summary is in order:

Baneling nest at 8:30

Spire once Lair finishes approx. 9:00

Pump lings until around 9:20

Morph spines/drone transfer the second ImmoSentry pushes out

Morph 15 banes

Bling bust

Make 10+ mutas when Spire finishes at ~11:00



http://tldr.me/8veo20.png


**Conclusion:**


Personally, no matter what strategy you use to try and defeat it, I feel my build is just better at providing a higher win rate at defeating it.

1366462634.0,1cqlpx,Tip I've found to combat 1v1 anxiety,Alexqzilla,36,4,46,"Ladder anxiety person here. This tip is somewhat obvious

I played strictly team games because 1v1s were just way too stressful. Not knowing what to prepare for, being too afraid to find out. I would scout but not really know what to do with what little information I saw. I would avoid 1v1s, even unranked, like the plague. 

What's really helped me get into games is having a strict build to run. As long as everything I do is written down in front of me

It removes the ""omg what should I be doing right now what is he doing is he about to come kill me"" thoughts and makes me feel somewhat less responsible for how the game goes. For example, it doesn't phase me nearly as much. I have pre-chosen to take that risk, and therefore I'm not overwhelmed with ""what if he rushes me what do I do"" anxiety. 

Furthermore

Just thought someone here might be able to use another tool in the toolbox to get themselves into games. Good luck have fun!

**TLDR: Have a build that allows the first 12ish minutes of the game to be 100% scripted. Knowing exactly what you're going to do no matter what the opponent might do takes a lot of pressure off of you.**

1368492020.0,1ea6h3,Zerg Versus Terran - Engaging Bio + Widow Mine,blade55555,31,2,5,,t5_2tkq6,False
1367956263.0,1dvrmf,"ZvT, what I do.",masterdz522,37,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/allthingszerg/comments/1dvrmf/zvt_what_i_do/, that is another story. I'm a mid-master Zerg whose ID is BaByEaTeR.527. I'm going to lay out what I do

Foremost, you want to go hatch first, as always, and drone scout for a proxy. These are less common now, but better safe than sorry. Go for the standard 16 pool, and go 16 gas. The reason for this gas is that the reaper openers are almost always the go-to opener for the Terran. If they avoid this opener, it is OK because you aren't behind. As always, unless you want to do a baneling bust (which I don't suggest). After taking your drones out of gas

As a good Zerg, add your 3 drones back into gas, take 2 more gases at your natural and start evo chambers. The reason for this is that the early bio pushes that Terrans have been using recently is easily shut down if you have proper upgrades. After getting your gases, take a third. As always, your next 100 gas should be spent on lair, and then a baneling nest. You don't need a super fast lair anymore, as upgrades are more important.

This is where you start being ""agressive"". The reason there are quotation marks around that word is because you don't REALLY want to be aggressive. You just want to get map control and let the Terran know that you have map control. Thus, making a macro hatch, and getting a spire, as well as continuing upgrades(including baneling speed and burrow for obvious reasons). Along with this spire, I tend to get pneumatised carapace (overlord speed) to help with picking off widow mines. Mutas can snipe 1-2 widow mines if you have overseers with them.

After your third is droned, you should be building an infestation pit. Your late game will, obviously, require hive tech. You should always aim for hive tech, as widow mines shut down most high-agression states.

What you should be doing with your units is very important. As your muta flock builds, as the game continues I tend to have a total of 16-20. These, initially, should be used to fend off drops. When my hive tech is starting, I tend to start building static defense to do this. This leaves your mutas to do counter attacks and pokes at his economy. If you lose some, it is OK, as they will be replaced by infestors. Also, ALWAYS lead with a small pack of 6-10 lings to spot for mine explosions

When your infestation pit finishes, festor, ultra, baneling to just ultra infestor with a few lings/banes mixed in. Ultralisks are amazing now, and with good fungals they are unstoppable. You shouldn't lose the game if it gets to this stage, unless they max on battlecruisers while you're having an epileptic seizure or something. Don't be afraid to attack into the Terran if you think you are vastly ahead. I suggest mixing in banelings to break walls if you plan to do this, though. Obviously

This is all if the Terran decides to go to late game. A lot of what you are having trouble with is widow mine + bio agression. From my experience with both T and Z in this matchup, you NEED to make sure that widow mines don't get money hits on your banelings. Most of it is your job, split your banelings before engagements like a terran would split marines. If you need to sacrifice a base, sacrifice it. The biggest thing I think zergs aren't doing is keeping tabs on their army, and one of the best ways to do this is through creep spread. If you know where they are and what they are doing, you can get a full surround. This should allow you to get a full surround and destroy your army when you are ready. Another thing is if their agression comes late, if you get out ultras in the middle they will just die. Many Terrans don't prepare for ultralisks ahead of time.

Anyhow, you can hit me up in game or on Skype (masterdz522) and I can try to help you. I'm not a perfect player. Hell, I'm not even a good player, but I hope that I can help. Also, most of the concepts I used were adapted from pro gamers' play.

I really enjoy seeing my students improve. Most of my students have reported back a few days later reporting a promotion! I know this isn't absolutely necessarily a result of my coaching alone

If you want some coaching from me please email me at nickyboy909@hotmail.com. or message me on bnet and we'll work out a time that works for the both of us! You can add my skype as well it is nickyboy9091.

How the coaching will go:
My coaching sessions start with looking at 1 or 2 replays of yours or you playing against me or the computer so I can get a feel for your playstyle prior to beginning. I will then pick at your style and point out where, then we do some live coaching vs an AI opponent or one of your friends around your level or I will do a demonstration of the build if necessary. It tends to be better if we focus on one specific matchup but it is possible to do all three, they'll just be less in depth of course. All this is absolutely free! All I ask is that you consider donating to my paypal if you want to support me and help me improve as a coach, a player and a caster. Almost all the money would be going to buying coaches of my own to help me improve my own coaching and playing! I want to make it clear that there is absolutely NO obligation here. just donate if you want to give me your support and can spare the moneyz... yes i know you can support me but not be able to afford to donate and thats fine!!! like i said only donate if you want to! my paypal is nick.murphy01@hotmail.com

Thanks to some advice here I managed to find a 14-14 extractor-pool opening, I kept getting crushed, until I decided, ""okay, one more game, then bed."" 

This was one for Husky's Bronze League Heroes. I ""macroed"" -- by which I mean I built about 140 zerglings -- until the point where I had about 150 supply massing up again a Bronze League Terran until I decided I didn't have anything to lose. He was walled in pretty well with TWO layers of supply depots backed up by a bunch of marines. Fuck it -- I went in anyway

I wasn't about to gg. No sir. I lost my army, overran the base, and it was jailbreak time. He must have gotten up to go pee or something. I didn't care. I wan IN this time baby. And boy did it ever feel sweet overrunning his base, taking out most of what he had. 

After I decimated him, poor, heroic zergling. 

So he was weak, or even go for an infestor siege?  Haha nope. I just sling my balls over my shoulder, make a few more banelings, and overrun him. 

This whole game was a true comedy of errors. To be honest, and 2) I won the last game I played. 

Who cares how much I suck? I enjoyed it. I won't be in Master's League any time soon. Hell, albeit haphazardly, and I'm getting down hitting the right keys to make things happen. 2-12. That'll get you the number one pick in the NFL most years! Tomorrow I'm gonna win another game I hope, and if I do that one win will make up for the many I will lose.

Unstable Payloads beyond the first one should be constructed much like a Brood War Scarab or Carrier Interceptor (capped at one payload of course), burrows it, it goes off, it basically pays for itself, you SEE the interaction on the map, and it's now up to the Terran player to maintain that position by re-arming the mine for a fair price to re-assert control in said position.

Having a 30 second rebuild time on additional Unstable Payloads would be fair. It would cost precious resources and slow a player down who opts to mass-maintain an army of mines significantly. 30 seconds is also enough time to re-arm the mine before the next wave of units arrive. Taking into consideration the average unit's build time, the harder it is to maintain. There must be a difficulty curve proportionate to the amount on the field, because the micro and attention to actually tread through them safely is comparatively higher.

For proper aesthetics, and is visible with detection as usual until armed. When armed, its default red light signals that its armed. This would let both players know what the current state of of the mine is, and each player can respond accordingly.


TLDR;

Pay a replacement cost to re-arm already-positioned mines like Interceptors (max cap for payload per mine remains as 1). Make sure you know what you're doing before massing them

1365524510.0,1bzwhk,Esper's ZvP 12 Pool Spire+Swarm Host Build,EsperCraft,32,7,33,"&gt; EDIT: I know I asked before about hosting it external to Reddit


# Esper's ZvP 12 Pool Spire + Swarm Host Build

## Overview
Hey Zergies, but I still feel like I can contribute to lower league players working on moving up the ladder.  The basis of this build order is to always know what our Protoss opponent is doing.  We want to react to early pressure, identify all-ins (not just that it's coming but exactly what's coming), and punish greedy play.  Protoss units are powerful and cost-efficient so to battle this we're going to focus on using Swarm Hosts as a source of free units tipping the cost-efficiency scale back in our favor.  The biggest benefit of this build is that I feel it's very flexible.  Since we place such a large commitment on scouting we are always aware of threats and can react appropriately.  I hope this is helpful to anybody who uses the build to success.  I also think it's important as Zergs to consider alternative builds because that's how you spur innovation and creative thinking.

## Why 12 Pool?
I feel this small section is necessary as most higher league players are going to hear 12 pool and automatically dismiss the guide.  12 Pools are too slow to punish Nexus first builds and not as economically focused as 14/15 pools or hatch first.  It's a personal preference of mine

## The Basic Build
Here's the basic outline of the build up until approximately 50-60 supply.  I don't go any further than right past Lair because there is a great deal of variance that can happen from that point forward.

* 9 Overlord
* 12 Spawning Pool
* 16 Overlord
* Queen + Extractor + Zerglings (I build my extractor so it times exactly with the finishing of the Spawning Pool).
    * Only put 2 drones in gas when it completes
* 19 or 20 Hatchery
* 21 Hatchery
* Start Zergling Speed @ 100 gas
* After you have 17 drones at your main
* Build Queen @ natural
* Overlord Speed @ 100 gas
* Build Queen @ third
* 40-45 supply
   * I normally line this up about 5-10 seconds after the queen at my natural finishes
* Start Lair @ ~100 gas (I say approximately 100 gas because you want to prioritize drone waves over the 5-10 seconds extra for the Lair)
* When Overlord Speed finishes
* **READ ""The 7:30 Mark"" Section**
* When Lair finishes
* Begin Locust Research + 1-2 Evolution Chambers
* When Spire finishes
* If safe
* Continue producing Swarm Hosts
* Use your mineral excess to start a 4th base
* Continue with Ranged/Carapace and Flyer Attack upgrades
* Victory Screen!


## The 7:30 Mark
This is the most pivotal point in the game ZvP.  It's when your speed Overlord(s) get a full peak in their base and you'll generally see one of the following scenarios:

* **Mass Gateways** - This is normally going to be a zealot/stalker 2-base all-in.  The other way to see this coming is if you don't see any gas at their natural you can assume they're going to hit you with this pressure.  You won't have the time for the Spire/Infestation Pit to finish; instead put down a Hydralisk Den and spines at your natural.  Continue building Zerglings and the most important decision is to make sure you do not lose drones.  If your third dies then make sure it's only the hatchery
* **Robo + Gateways** - Two things are important here: (1) is the Robo building or done and (2) how many Gateways are there?  If the Robo is done, your goal is just to deflect the attack.  If it's a Robo expand smile and continue with the build.
* **Stargate + Gateways** - This is going to be a common sight, but if it doesn't get put down in the first place it's a much easier delay.  Regardless, continue with the build.
* **Stargate + Robo** - This is also common
* **Twilight + Gateways** - This means 1 of 3 things: (1) DTs


## Tips &amp; Tricks
So the build is fairly straight forward I feel.  The two gas in geyser is a bit awkward if you're not used to it

* Remember you can rally eggs individually.  After I get 16 drones at my main I move my rally to my natural minerals.  Likewise as soon as my extractors at the natural finish I rally all 3 Hatcheries to my third even though my natural is not fully saturated.  After you make the larva into drones
* Drones and Zerglings are the same thing.  One is for economy one is for safety.  While I give hard numbers for the first portion of the build after that sometimes flexibility is required.  You're not bound to make an entire production cycle only Zerglings or only Drones
* Be wary of your unit rally.  Generally speaking I like to set my unit rally right into my minerals as well.  Since I ctrl group my eggs into my army
* Drone out
* After you make your extractors
* Once your siege position is established rally 2-4 Overlords to it so you can drop creep in front of the Swarm Hosts.  Make sure you hold position with them and do NOT
* When you build your fourth base (or any base really) rally 2 building drones to the base and use them to make extractors.  Next production cycle make 6 drones and rally 3 to each geyser.  You want to be mining gas immediately when  the Hatchery finishes.
* Micro'ing Swarm Hosts can be kind of clunky sometimes.  I set my Swarm Hosts to their own control group, and make sure to spam that rally forward while they're burrowing.  Otherwise you may have your Swarm Hosts burrow and the Locusts don't go anywhere.  If you see a rally line that extends backwards beyond your siege position it means you have a burrowed Swarm Host behind (probably on rally).  Find it and move it forward.
* If you find yourself in a stalemate situation where you're not busting their third but they can't move out either then take a cluster of Swarm Hosts and move them over to attack the natural.  Your Corruptors/Zerglings are going to have much better mobility so you can bounce back and forth.
* Use your Corruptors to snipe Colossus.  Even if they have Stalkers under

## Replays
I have 6 replays included of me doing the build.  You'll notice my macro is kind of bad, but because they're almost always because my macro slipped or I didn't react properly.  I looked through them all and that's mostly where the reactions in the ""7:30 Mark"" section have come from.

2x gas in main and 1 at natural

Evolution Chamber (Life builds spores in mineral lines due to MC's Stargate opener)

+1 and Hydra Den when Lair finishes

Hydra speed

Start pumping out tons of Hydras and Lings and attack the third of Protoss if they have one which they probably should. 

MC actually went Collosus here to counter Hydra's but behind this attack Life started a Spire and forced MC to gg when the mutas were out. Something to keep in mind is that this build was pretty greedy and worked out because MC didn't do any gateway pressure. 

_________________________________________________
Life vs Flash Game 3 Ling/Bling All in

A crazy build by Life that really put the ""Swarm"" in Heart of the Swarm. He opts to get 2 macro hatches before the Lair to put on a huge amount of pressure with zerglings/banelings.

9 Overlord

15 Hatch -----&gt; Gas-------&gt; Spawning Pool

2x Queens

Zergling Speed

Takes all but 1 drone out of gas

3rd Hatch @ ~4:55

Zerglings as needed

Queens for Creep spread and defense

2x Evolution Chamber/ Start adding more lings to your army

+1/+1 started

Baneling Nest

2x Macro Hatches  

Lair

Pump out tons of lings from 4 hatches you have

Morph tons of banelings. Life went up to 22 banes for the first attack w/ 78 lings as well

Huge attack by Life into the natural of Flash. Kills TONS of workers and army

___________________________________________________

Life vs MC Game 3 Roach/Ling Timing Attack

This build completely caught MC off guard with a midgame Roach/Ling attack. I apologize for not having a lot of super new HOTS units builds.

9 Overlord

14 Spawning Pool

16 Hatch 

Pair of Lings/Queen

3rd @ ~3:50

Make sure to get queens at the natural and third and start droning for a bit

2x gas @ 5:45. (Slightly earlier than normal)

Starting pumping some lings and get speed started

Take all gas

Roach Warren

Lair

Life starts 13 or so roaches and a ton of lings for a big relatively early attack on MC which ends of killing him. As Life moved out he started a spire and finished off the crippled MC with Mutas. Life's huge economy along with a pretty nice early timing attack allows him to overrun MC.

________________________________________________________

Leenock vs Babyknight Game 1

Leenock showed some an awesome new strategy involving a super fast Lair and the use of swarm hosts and vipers to contain Babyknight on 2 bases

9 Overlord

15 Hatch

17 Pool

18 Gas

2x Queens

6 or so lings and start speed

Overlord Speed Research. This is on Hatch tech and we've seen a lot of Zergs in HOTS get this to improve scouting.

Take all Gas and start Lair (Leenock used the Hatch at the natural)

When Lair is done start a Hydra Den

Third Hatch

Start making Hydralisks for defense and eventually offense

Get some macro hatches and start making Swarm Hosts. Once you have a decent amount begin moving to the third and set them up. If your creep is spread far enough you can build a spine wall and use them to cover your Swarm Hosts. Keep adding on Swarm Hosts/Hydras/ and if he gets Collosus get some Vipers for the abduct ability. The cool thing about this Swarm Host siege is that the Locusts are free

Life starts Hive @ 13 minutes and begins to swich his comp to Ultralisk/Ling/Bling  with a few infestors due to his opponents lack of sentries and his choice of comp. I know I didn't put the timings for everything, so feel free to call me out on anything I said that was inaccurate :D

I play Zerg now since early last year. I was a former platinum terran, to make sure, my decision was absolute. I tried a bit protoss (I initially started with playing protoss in ladder season one, because they were my favourite race in SC1), but most games lacked the excitement of fast engagements, because at that time almost all lower league protoss player turtled to death ball on 2 bases and so did I. Finally, my journey with the swarm began.

Soon, creating army out of seemingly nothing, constant harrass with mutalisks and so on. Larva Inject was really fun to learn (I tried several methods over the year, finally came up with the base cam hotkey set to spacebar). I flipped my whole hotkey setup because finally, I felt that I could do better with rearranging my stuff, and I actually did.

I barely used direct build orders, addapted quite nicely to what my enemy would do. And with the release of HotS I finally managed to get back to platinum and was able to defeat most of my opponents (beside most ZvZ's. I really started to hate that damn match up). 

I have two or three decent master level player in my friendlist, maybe even low masters, if I practice more.

And here is my point, where I get absolute bm for no reason. I play 10-30 games a week with a regular, physical somewhat exhausting job, I have a girlfriend and an annoying (&lt;3) cat to take care of. I love SC2, I love the eSport-scene, I like to watch my favourite pros march to victory in major tournaments, I like to buy stuff to support eSports (I'm wearing one of the 3 TL-Shirts with the racial logo right at the moment), love to discuss latest tournament games with my friends. 

And I DAMN want to improve my overall SC2-skill. 



TL;DR: Is anyone willing to go through a couple of my replays and point out mistakes, so I can work them out? I would really, really appriciate it. 

PS: I'll upload replays if anyone is actually interessted to help me out.

I believe without reservation that everyone benefits from the attention and guidance of the right people, I've had quite a few people who couldn't afford coaching contact me and ask for help. I always answer their questions and push them towards a learning resource that I think would help them, but in terms of 1-on-1 coaching, I just didn't have the time to do it myself.  

A few months ago, but it's understandable - coaching is a business and I was asking them to take a risk.  

Despite this minor set-back, and several team members have already expressed their enthusiasm about the project and offered their time and resources to help get started.  

I'd like to ask for your trust and support

It's an all in but if you do enough damage it's not that hard to recover. 
If the all in fails (which rarely happens)

Basically

Build: 

15 hatch
16 pool
17 gas
17 overlord

get speed as soon as possible


24-25 ovie

drones drones drones 

36 roach warren 
36 2nd gas 

And now morph at least 4 ovie

52 baneling nest 
more ovies and only lings 

Once the lings gets to the roaches (in front of your opponents natural)
morph as many banelings as possible and focus the bunker

rally more lings and keep your injects going (really important)

You only need 2 queens.

1356932789.0,15pm50,A discourse about swarm host usage and why they are good for the game.,Jaedolf,35,11,26,"Okay

- Strategic range, the swarm host is by far unit with the highest potential range in the game.
- Can attack while being invisible
- Very high dps
- if the locusts are killed
- Attacks only ground

Consider the locust
- 14 dps, it should become immediately apparent that the locust is not a tank by any means, it's a glass cannon. While locusts can tank damage because they are free, you want to keep them _alive_. Yes, they will die anyway after a timed life which is important to consider, but locusts are glass cannons.

Alright, let's just assume that it could be used 'in your main army' while having strategic range, that would mean it would be the single best unit ever in the game if it was good in close combat and could attack at strategic range it would be the most broken unit ever. It's like amoving tempests into an army and being surprised at how terrible they are. The swarmhost simply is terrible if it's range isn't used appropriately, and it should be. People try to use them as lurkers, they aren't lurkers, lurkers do not have this huge range and do way more damage.

As is any unit with a very high range

Okay

- They are great at breaking a choke, he could just walk into Z's natural with his larger army and end the game. Z had to be really ahead to be able to break a choke where T had a strong defensive position with tanks before brood lords. The swarm hosts provides a capability to do this while simulatenously setting up a hard contain.

- They are great at holding a choke

- They are great against anything that can inhaerently not reach them, same thing with spine crawlers, bunkers, and you name it.

- They are excellent at containing mech armies. Since swarmhosts vastly outrange siege tanks

__Why they are an inhaerently good unit for the spectatorship__

The swarm host is often compared to the Lurker

- The thing with tanks is that they create a mexican standof, they create a tug of war, the player with the higher swarmhost count will eventually break through. A swarmhost contain thereby puts more pressure upon the opponent and creates an eb and flow. Evidenced by Ryung vs MKP on Antiga, MKP contained Ryung but Ryung didn't even bother, he had his own tanks and just sat there denying MKP's attempts at expanding with drops, swarm hosts put pressure on your opponent and more than just containing actually creating a need to break out rather than to just sit there.

- Lurkers were often considered a zerg siege tank, it creates certain elements of luck involved as well as extremely short battles whereas swarmhosts create extremely _long_ battles in a tug of war where it won't be clear who wins them until the very end.

- THey are actually completely not like the BL. Yes, the most important thing is that broodlings don't have to slowly walk to the enemy and thereby provide next to no tanking. Another thing is that BL's are in the same range class as colossi which is actually the most awful range class in the game, they have longe enough range that it makes them weak enough in a straight up fight that they need a tanking layer, thereby promoting deathballing, but their range is short enough that they can't actually be used strategically on their own. Siege tanks, and tempsts are the next range class and carriers can fall into either depending on if you use the leash. Seige tanks to some extend have long enough range to effectively be used strategically in such a way that the position really matters (and for some reason Zerg have whined for maps to be able to be designed that not a single strategical use of tanks can still take place). Swarm hosts are a whole different level and you often see people on the ladder not using this, it might come as a surprise but you actually want to position them such that they can just barely reach what they want to reach and as far away as possible from it. You often see people just thoughtlessly plant them in the general vicinity

And with all this, specific situations need to arise for them to be useful. It depends on the map, the state of the game, and what your opponent is doing, but without swarmhosts. P could just turtle with tempests and cannons and and there would be no way ever for Z to break it.

That's not the point of this post

The point of this post, if that makes any sense. It was vs. Protoss, which for me usually means ""about to get rolled over by mass void rays and colossi"" but, armed with all the knowledge I've gained from here and from LowkoTV, I gave it my best.

Guys, but I felt for the first time like *I* was in control. I had recently started working on being better about scouting, and using control groups instead of just F2, and stopped his initial attack before it ever reached my base.

After that, and then followed up with some constant pressure with my mutalisks. He ahd some void rays, but they just weren't enough... he tried to split them, and take out my base while holding off my attack, but I had been smart enough to not try an all-in, and once the mutas and spore crawlers/queens at my bases mopped up his feeble counter assault, they joined my main force at his base

The mighty Protoss I had feared for so long was fallen.

I had won before, the first victory I truly felt I had earned, and it feels fantastic.

Aside from uploading into replayfu you can (and should) also upload the game you wish to have analyzed to http://app.ggreplayz.com/. The website automatically uploads the game into youtube aswell.
What this does is it will allow redditors like us that are in school or at work analyze your games without the need of gettin into bnet or having SC2 installed. Feel free to PM me games you have on youtube that you wish to have analyzed. I dont mind and it helps get the day by faster.

1351883421.0,12j0pj,Guide on the Basics of ZvZ Early Game,mavvie,25,3,19,"Hello everyone and welcome to my ZvZ guide!

**Introduction**
My name is Mavvie, so I personally feel that my points don't reflect my skill very accurately, just because of how small the sample size is. ZvZ is actually my worst matchup, but I always feel confident while playing it. It's definitely the hardest Zerg matchup, at least because there aren't any guides on it yet! I know that Ostojiy and Belial are working on ZvZ guides, and I have no doubt that they will both greatly outshine mine, but I figured I'll just provide my view and insight on the matchup :)

**Early Game**


Oh boy

* Cheesy pool first (6-9 pool)
	I'm not going to talk about these at all

* 10 pool
	This is an interesting build. It is a build order win against hatch first and early pools, and expand ~16-17 after your queen + gas. You have a bigger economy and better production, so even if he expands when you do, don't fret! Try to check his gas timing; if yours is really far ahead then you can go for a speedling/bane bust. If it's about even then get defensive banelings and play standard (You ARE ahead in the drone count, so don't worry). His gas shouldn't be faster than yours, but if it somehow is then just play defensively. Get fast banelings, defend and saturate 2 bases. I recommend a double evo roach/infestor style off 2 bases, then get a spine of your own and produce queen + lings. Don't get gas, just don't stop making lings. 1 queen and you can poke at his lings

* Pool-hatch-gas opener (15-&gt;16-&gt;17 usually)
Standard macro build. 15 pool, but there's many, many others. It gets late gas, so watch out for a 14/14 ling bane all-in. These can be defended by either a) Getting a baneling nest before speed, or b) Getting 3/4 queens and/or a second spine at your natural to defend. Wall off your ramp, simcity to save your spines, etc. There really isn't much to this build. Your first 2 lings can go scout/pressure a little, every game.

* Hatch first opener (hatch-gas-pool
Simple build. The gas before pool openers are safer, stay safe. First 100 gas goes to ling speed, then pull 1 drone off gas until 50 gas where you get a baneling nest (~25-28 supply). With that timing you should be safe. Scout and react, you should be fine against everything.

General tips on defending all-ins:

* *Always* get a spine at 5:00

* Don't be greedy. When your bane nest finishes

* Poke his natural at 5:15-5:30. This can be with lings or an overlord, more on this later).

* Simcity is a good unit. Pros like to create some form of simcity that creates chokes. You can use baneling nests

* When worst comes to worst

* There's no reason not to see any and every unit that leaves his base; use overlords to their full potential!


Specific all-ins:

**14/14 Ling/bane all-in:**

Super easy to scout (no expand, otherwise go bane nest first and don't hesitate to make a few extra queens. This is extremely common in the lower leagues, but you should never lose. Play honestly, get a bane nest and spine in time, produce lings after getting a small drone lead, and you should be fine. Defenders advantage is awesome.


**1 base roach all-in**

A terrible build. Get a few spines shortly before he moves out

Just to elaborate a bit: If he's doing a 1 base roach expand, but roaches are so slow that it doesn't matter. As long as you have 2/3 spines, reactive speedlings + spines will hold ezpz. 


**""2 base"" roach/ling all-in**

A bit more powerful, usually has no upgrades. Defend with spine/ling/bane at your natural, and try to start lair before he moves out. The tech advantage you have is huge, along with the drone lead. Stop at like, 34 drones at most and then mass units.

You can also go roaches yourself; if you do this you can actually get more drones out


I think that's pretty much all the early game all ins in ZvZ

TL;DR

* Get an honestly timed bane nest + spine

* Try to saturate your natural; that's your goal in the early game

* Use overlords to scout his natural drone count and to see if he moves out

So without further ado

9OL
17 gas
@pool finish
26 OL
30 OL

42/44 In this order, roach warren@nat, 3rd queen@nat  
note: third queen lays two tumors

next: take 2nd gas@nat as you drone to 49/52  
49/52 6 lings
52/76 make 8 roaches
66/78 rally all hatches to third and drone to 78  
78/78 2OL
drone to 90/94
90/94 2OL, 4th base, 2 gas@ third, and rally each base back to its own mineral line  

From here the build opens up to your choice of tech and unit composition.  

 In game two against Yoda
  
 In game three, you should make these variations in reaction to what the Terran is doing, such as making spores if he's going for banshees.

Works in HotS and WoL!,marshall19,27,8,25,"I've have a massively positive win rate in ZvZ in HotS and I thought I would share my build with you guys. At the end of WoL I was learning a new ZvZ opener and in beta I adapted it to make for a perfect anti-muta timing. And given that 95% of use are slaves to the extremely one dimensional ZvZ metagame and always go mutas
) are: 1. Any ling/baneling all ins beyond early pools fail. 2. It is extremely effective against players going mutas on lair tech. 3. I have used this successfully on several current WoL grandmasters zerg players... aka it works in both games


Here is the build: First do a gasless expand. 15 hatch, you might need to make 2 spine if you suspect agro play) block the ramp with the queens(hold position) when you are not injecting although you should know when lings are coming at you if you competently placed your overlords. Make your 3rd and 4th queens as soon as the first set is done. You are droning all the way up to 36 supply. Once at 36, take a gas in your nat and a gas in your main. Throw down a roachW followed by an evoC.(make these buildings as part of a wall to the ramp along with the spine(s). With the first 100 gas make a lair, with the next 100 get +1 ranged attack. Continue with queen production out of the non-laired hatch. If you see lings moving out at this section of the game, feel free to cancel +1 or even the lair(if you don't have the gas) to get 2-5 roaches out. If the lings/banes come, run your natural drones by mineral walking through the ramp queens.

Take your 3rd and 4th gasses maybe a minute after your first gasses. Try to drone up to max saturation (16 on minerals, so they will likely have 5-8 mutas. Regardless of what they have, you have to be all over the transfuses, if they have mass roach(like in WoL) you need the transfuses + extra queen DPS or you are screwed. If they have mutas you need to transfuse before they can focus down any queens. Anyway, aside from transfuse, you are just slow pushing with an unbreakable force. Keep making roaches and sending them through the worm. Sometime, the build can be slightly late or you messed up the tranfuses or some other mistakes were made. If your first attack failed it is likely you did at least some economic damage to their nat. Follow up by getting a hydra den and +2 and time a new worm to finish with the upgrade.

Simplified:

15 hatch

16 pool

+2 queens

+2 queens

36 gas

35 gas

34 RoachW

33 EvoC

first 100 gas - Lair

second 100 gas - +1 range

+ 2 gas

Fully saturate and continue queen production at available hatcheries.

So far the guide only goes over bronze league and i'm in the process of writing up the silver league part

**If you find reddit's clumped style difficult to read

**(WARNING EXTENSIVE READ)**


Firstly I’d like to talk a little bit about what you need as a person

You have to ask yourself; why do you play? Really, so that he can bring them to tournaments and compete at a higher intensity - the professional scene drives this mentality home constantly.

Once you’ve agreed to focus on improving rather than having fun

Your next step is about how to approach games, and also not become affected so much by losses? Simple; 

**Winning is not the aim and never should be – the aim should always be to improve.**

You really have to believe that, rather than the grand scheme.

**Believe in yourself.**

You have to believe in yourself in order to fast track up the leagues. Everyone can get themselves into gold at the least, then you won’t – this is also true for ‘real life’, as with most things related to improving in SCII. So, you’re having trouble believing you can get past your league wall – Once you’ve read through this, and you’ve put a little bit of effort into learning the strategies listed and general game plans, you’ll feel much better about yourself. I had a similar thing at platinum level, and when Scrible helped me out with a game plan verse toss I felt so much more confident entering the games

“Self-talk” can be a very useful tool in order to gain confidence. You can simply tell yourself over and over that you’re going to win ( a lot of professional sporting players do this ). Another great way of boosting your confidence with self-talk is to repeat your timings to yourself as you click “Find Match”. I.e. “I will get my gas at six minutes

**Set yourself a season-long goal

My seasonal goal was to go from Bronze to Masters in a maximum of 8 weeks – alas, Y and Z”. Applying these small ‘session goals’ you’ll start to see an improvement – your win;loss ratio may go down, but your overall skill will improve.

I’ll take an insert of my diary I kept on my local forum. This was the first entry I made

&gt;“Day 1: Macro.
&gt;
&gt;I've decided to master the most basic thing a SCII player can; macro. The key word being 'master'. A lot of players(including a younger self) will accept ""learn"" as a good enough degree. 
&gt;
&gt;Goals: Never miss a larvae drop from 0:00 - 11:30.
&gt;At 5:00 to have 3 base and 3 queen.
&gt;Ready to attack at 11:30 
&gt;Be around 60-65 drones at 11:00
&gt;
&gt;The build I'm using is Stephano's Zerg Max
&gt;
&gt;Result: 
&gt;At 5:00 to have 3 base and 3 queen.
&gt;Ready to attack at 11:30
&gt;Be around 60-65 drones at 11:00
&gt;
&gt;Not very successful with getting 3 queen by 5 minutes(hatch is fine). Larve macro improved. Build order not memorised well enough to not have to concentrate on it. Found attacking at a specific time rather difficult, you can't even begin to expect to do mid-late pushes on a designated time. Supply blocked a couple times, trying to figure out when is a good time to spam overlords. My focus was this, and also to basically just crush the opponent using pure macro-large-force-armies, rather than timed pushes. Most of the work is sloppy, but we'll get there.”

By doing this I could clearly identify and quantify what I had to work on

**Force yourself to play more games.**

Being out of your comfort zone is the soil in which you grow stronger.

A little algorithm I came up with for how many games you should try to play goes like this; n*1.3 = x
(games you usually play) x (1.3) = Games you should be playing (round the number up or down accordingly).

Now, and 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 all get rounded 'up' to make 1.0 - this also means that 1.1 becomes 1.0 and 4.5 becomes 5.0.


E.g. If I currently play 2 games and become tired.

2 * 1.3 = 2.6
= 3.0
we then round 2.6 up to 3.0 and thus

Furthermore; if we play 5 games in a row; 
5 * 1.3 = 6.5 
rounded up makes 7. We now play 7 games in a row next time.

This even works if you can hit out 20 games in a row. 20 * 1.3 = 26. Notice how the jump isn't massive? 'Exponentially' your games played should increase

**Dealing with Cheese.**

If you come across someone who plays with cheese try your best to defend it. If you manage to defend it, it’s to improve your macro – cheese defence starts happening at diamond/low masters. Again, the loss does not matter, what you improved on was your familiarity with the cheese and how well/bad you returned to your game plan afterwards.

Upon returning to game plans after successful defending of cheese;
I recommend trying to stick to the timings regardless, and the cheese has recently been defended, just throw down your hatchery asap – things like that. This should start to develop your own game sense and as you progress through the leagues you’ll start to learn how to adjust accordingly.

**Setting up your SCII.**

Firstly

Control group 1 should be used for your main army/melee units

Control group 2 should be used for banelings/ranged/infestors when on brood/infestor/corruptor.

Control group 3 should be used for special units; infestors/mutas/broodlords

Control group 4 should be all of your hatcheries (depending on your inject method)

Control group 5 should be your queen(s) all queens on this if you ‘backspace’ inject.

Control group 6 should be your second queen if you don’t do the backspace inject method.

Control group 7 queen

Control group 8 queen

Control group 9 Spire(s)

Control group 0 Evo chambers or any other important upgrading buildings.

**Let’s gloss over what we’ve read.**

* Your main focus in SCII should be to improve.
* Having the correct mentality when dealing with loss and laddering.
* Winning should never be the aim; improving should be.
* Believe in yourself that you can indeed rise up leagues.
* Set yourself a seasonal goal and also ‘session’ goals each night
* Think about keeping a record or diary of your thoughts/analysis about your SCII play.

Now that we’ve identified what we need to become in order to improve rapidly

Macro will be your complete focus until you have achieved diamond league.

All-ins are tempting but they won’t force you to improve. When you are in leagues lower than diamond you have the luxury of winning purely on macro and a little game sense/mechanics. Once you’ve leagued up into diamond and masters, a click, you’ll win” when you’re in gold or platinum league; because anyone who is saying that is just completely out of touch with the lower leagues. In ZvP late game at gold level you still need to position your broods correctly otherwise you’ll lose to an archon toilet.

***From Bronze league to achieving (low)Gold league, and then in the replay watch your macro fall completely. Remember, you goal isn’t to win, but to improve your macro and economy management.***

I think we can all agree that the introduction of Heart of the Swarm has been a great step forward for Starcraft 2 players

But don't you sometimes find yourself staring down a pack of 20 Widow Mines and reminiscing about the good old days? The days where stepping on creep meant certain death of Terran; where [banelings, and infestors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uscwz6eY9Wo#t=15m23s) or [any other ungodly assortment of death](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMSv9_f8rh8#t=1m01s) spewed from each crack and crevice of the map. Tired of watching your units disappear around the map to invisible death traps? 


Ever think to yourself


Then this season is for you! Remind the Terrans you love about the beauty of the Siege Tank. Be part of the movement to bring back those gracious death cannons. Force your Terran partners to participate in ~~your selfish nostalgia~~ the good old days

Personally, because if I don't play for several days, I feel like it takes me a few games just to get back in the swing of things.

In particular, back a year ago when I was playing WoL I would always get my hive tech out way too late, and I still make mistakes like this unless I've been playing a _lot_.  Then real life gets in the way and I end up not playing for a few days and I slide back a half a step again.  

So how about you guys?  How much do you play and what is your league?  Do you find you require a few games to brush off the dust after not playing for a few days?

**ZvT**


The basic idea here is pretty simple. If they go mech, things get a bit more complicated, but you can generally go ling/bling/muta into ultras. You should be getting some infestors with this as well, and I imagine you could still substitute infestors for mutas. Should note that you're probably not intending to kill them with the mutas if you choose that route, but rather just trying to use them as a stepping stone to reach ultralisk tech. Ultralisks are excellent, especially in conjunction with blinding cloud and/or fungal.

A lot of people say that widow mines make mutas useless, and forcing them to produce defenses to deal with your mutas. That being said, widow mines are extremely annoying, and if they start to amass any reasonable number of them, you obviously don't want to be going muta from there.

What you open with is kind of irrelevant. I've been doing a roach opening every game but that was partly because of the old reapers

&gt;If at any point you are unsure what you should be doing

Things that are particularly annoying or scary in HoTS ZvT
- A lot of widow mines: you have no choice but to get Hydras, especially if you are ahead macro-wise. I've had success just barreling through widow mine fields with ultras because they're pretty beefy and don't care about splash
- Battlecruiser transition - I think Zerg anti-air in general is pretty weak

Neither of these are a problem if your macro is better than your opponent's. I can't emphasize enough that the most important thing to improve is your macro. That is to say, most of the time.

Swarm hosts: these are an awkward unit. They don't really fit into any particular unit composition, but at that point you might as well use brood lords, which kind of illustrates the problem with the unit.


**ZvP**


At first I thought the mothership core was going to break the matchup but I was completely wrong. It actually doesn't seem to have much of an effect, etc) but in general it's pretty easy to pick a simple game plan and win a lot of games.

&gt;You can beat just about any midgame protoss army composition with roach/speed hydra and good upgrades. This includes the immortal/sentry all in (in my experience

This air toss composition is very difficult to deal with and will no doubt be changed at some point in the near future. Corruptors get shredded by the new void ray, but I hate that unit, and so does Blade, so as a result I haven't tried it out or seen it used very much. Infestors have the obvious problem of dying reaaaaaaal hard to feedback, but they're probably the best bet, perhaps in conjunction with hydras or corruptors or something.

Vipers can be useful for pulling carriers and tempests and maybe colossi if they have those into your army of hydras

**The important thing to remember is that ZvP in HoTS is not a matchup in which your fortunes are likely to improve over time.** Rather, with a strategy kind of like this:

* quick gasless 3 hatch
* 2 gas geysers at 6 minutes
* roach warren and speed and evo
* lair with the second 100 gas you mine
* take 2 additional geysers
* figure out what he's doing with overlords
* hydra den asap; range first
* make roaches and hydras until either he 1) all ins you or 2) expands
* if he expands you attack
* if he all ins you make nothing but units and crush it

Often protoss players will opt for a stargate opening. If you hold it well, rally roaches behind, and cancel or delay their third while taking your fourth, and get a lead together that you can lean on throughout the rest of the game.

spores are really easy to get

Another thing: if you scout and are positive he is not going stargate, because it's just too hard to catch up from that point

That being said if you go muta and he does some kind of 2 base gateway unit all in you can be in trouble. After dying this way once or twice due to lazy scouting or w/e I've pretty much stuck to roach/hydra


**ZvZ**


ZvZ is very simple! Go mutas every game. You basically can't go wrong with this in my experience. The strategy works something like this:

* 15 pool
* build two pairs of lings
* Based on his gas timing
* get either 3 pairs of additional lings if you want to play passive or a whole bunch if you want to play aggressive
* either way you want 2 banes at home on the top of your ramp to defend
* figure out if he is doing something like a roach/bane all in. He's probably not
* you should be droning throughout this process
* when you hit lair you should have about 2 full bases with 4 gas geysers running strong. drop a spire immediately
* then take your third. Make a whole bunch of speedlings at this point to protect your third and potentially deny his if possible
NOTE: OVERLORD POSITIONING IS EXTREMELY KEY IN ZvZ. Generally speaking: your first overlord should end up behind his natural's mineral line to see if he is speedling all-inning you. Your second overlord should go in front of his natural to see his units as they come out. Your third overlord should go sit at his third to keep an eye on it. If you don't do this last step

Note that the above is actually exactly what you do in WoL to get mutas up as well. We're not coming up with anything groundbreaking here.

Once you have your first round of mutas out, preferably ready to go the instant the hatchery finishes.

ASSUMING HE WENT MUTA AS WELL:

From here you're just trying to macro as well as possible until you get an advantage by catching him when he has less mutas than you do or securing a fourth before he does. Once you have a sufficiently large advantage

Ultralisks are the holy grail of the ZvZ lategame. There is basically nothing that beats them

ASSUMING HE DID NOT GO MUTA

If he does this and manages to hold his third, you are in trouble. But neither of those situations should happen unless you mess up. If you have played your cards right, he should not have the resources both to take a third at the same time you do AND produce enough roach/hydra or infestors to hold off your muta/ling. That means his third is more than likely going to be later than yours.

At this point you want to make enough mutas to be intimidating, you're going to win that fight. If he goes straight hydra, he might be able to produce enough to kill your mutas before you hit ultra tech, but ling/bane will work wonders against his army composition anyway. 

There are a number of reasons that mutas are so strong in the HoTS ZvZ metagame:
* obvious buffs to mutas in terms of speed and health regen make them more formidable and slow down your enemy's attempt to amass a counter-push strong enough to deal with them
* infestor nerfs have made it even less cost-efficient to deal with mutas unless you have a TON of infestors (range increase notwithstanding)
* ultras are an excellent transition that do not care about any of the things that kill mutas. They will chomp through hydras and rofl across fields of fungal growth

Tadaaa. The only annoying part is that if you get behind in the muta race you're in kind of a bind. You kind of have to fight your way back into the game with zergling/baneling counters and turtling behind spores and queens, this comes down to macro, and the player with the better macro is the one who is going to win in HoTS ZvZ as it stands.

Don't be afraid to make a bunch of spines if you're floating minerals. This goes for pretty much every matchup

**Questions, and I'll reply. Maybe we can get a productive discussion going ^_^ I don't claim to have laid out a definitive guide to anything in the post above, but I do think it represents a good foundation for those who are feeling lost in HoTS. If there's any way I can help you with a specific problem, or if you disagree with me on some point and want to discuss it, please don't hesitate to post below.***

Its been becoming more and more apparent in my group of friends that I am currently the best Zerg, as my styles are only so diverse.

---

Let me say a bit more about myself and the group. We're a group of friends from across the world with a full mix of leagues/races/ages/genders who meet up on the **EU server**. We aim to improve and have fun, we usually observe games between each other and give general advice and chat. Though sometimes we break out into teamgames or arcade, depends how we want to blow off steam! We've played in a few internal and external clan wars/tournaments, and we look to continue these internal tournaments (and external, if our higher ranked players are confident).

I'm a Masters Zerg from the UK. I don't know whether I'm low, HoTS Beta and now. I enjoy all matchups equally, and currently feel that my ZvZ and ZvP are equal with my ZvT being weaker. I play a mostly reactionary, scouting-heavy style in ZvZ using a heavily upgraded Burrow-Roach midgame like the pros use. I like to use early Vipers in ZvP, transitioning into Ultralisks then Mutalisks. In ZvT, I am currently experimenting with [the strategies explored by Day9 in his most recent Daily on Life vs Jjakji](http://day9.tv/d/Day9/day9-daily-613-life-vs-jjakji-zvt-low-tech-style/), although I can also do a variety of 2 base plays.

One of the Terrans in our group is, [one of whom successfully defeated NightEnD](http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=407856) in the WCS EU S1 qualifier, who I also trade games fairly well with.

As for Zergs... well, I'd be happy with that. If you're interested in this kind of thing, or have any questions about anything I said, either shoot me a message here or find me ingame on Stark.1785 and I can help you from there.

**Replays:** All of these games were played on the same day when I was playing really bad

http://drop.sc/339829 (slightly bm player

http://drop.sc/339831 (normal build

-------------


**The Build:**

15 pool

16 hatch (if you can try to pretend you're 15 hatching when you see the first probe

17 gas

17 ovie

from there

Possible modification: When the pool finishes, the other just randomly a moving all over the minimap to look for probe. If the first ling scouts that the opponent went gateway expand into walling off with an additional 3 gateways, he's doing an expand 4 gate (naniwa style, possibly with a stargate behind it), you have to change the build and get a roach warren or an extra 2ish spines and defend with speedlings or anything. Since you started 2 base, it should be a much easier hold than 3 base play and you only have to defend one spot. You can partially wall off with the roach warren too if you like. 

With gas: get speed first


 other 3 gas at 42 supply (OFF TOPIC: 2 base builds usually get 4 queens and all 4 gas at 36 OR first gas at 17 and other 3 at 42 supply OR first two gases at 28 supply and second two at 42 supply)

Either get an expo down now or after you make your hydras/mutas (preferably a little later to play safe)

When lair is done

If you see robotics facility or robo bay

If you see anything else

--------------------

**IF YOU WENT HYDRAS**, and maybe make ~10 reinforcement lings or so to tank. It's better to not lose the hydras so they're still a threat and you can use them later for harassment. Just try to damage the wall, make him scared, and go colossi. Also pick off any phoenix that you can if he went air. If he went air, the hydra attack should do a bit of damage, stop phoenix production, and maybe pick off a phoenix or two. After camping the bottom of his base for about 1-2 mins

After you get enough hydras

From there, and are playing vs. a toss who just went colossi tech on 2 bases who now has to get blink and high templar before expoing to third. Should be an easy win. 


-------------------


**IF YOU SAW ROBOTICS AND WENT MUTAS**, speedlings, and base race. You should be able to win the base race. If he gets to a good phoenix count, put down double evo chamber, roach warren, and hydra den and go roach/hydra with superior economy and eventual vipers and win.",,,,

1369020506.0,1eo8rj,Guide: ZVP how to 10 pool 10 gas and how to know when,spartanblue6,19,1,16,"Hey guys i've been a long time lurker and noticed that there hasn't (to my knowledge) been a 10 pool 10 gas zvp build out there so i decided to make one! Now note this build is only meant as a hard counter against **gateway expands**

To start off i'm a high masters zerg (I hope that give me some credit) who after watching Lifes 10 pool 10 gas allin vs parting decided to try it out and make the build himself. After some finetuning and losses i came up with this build. 

*10 pool
*10 double extractor trick
*Cancel second extractor made (because it's the later one)
*@100% put 3 drones on gas
*11 Overlord
*11 Queen
*13 drone
*@100% gas pull drones off gas
*14 nonstop ling production until 24 supply
*24 Natural Hatchery

At this point you should have most of your lings across the map and ready to enter the main base of your opponent by 4:50. 
At this point you should move your lings straight into your opponents mineral line and go for their probes and you should be able to get a quick win if they decide to fight. If they opened up conservatively and have a zealot/stalker+mothership core and they have good probe micro move immediatly to their natural cancel/kill their Nexus and any buildings you can. At this point you can contain them until they get 3 gates up and a few sentries and you should be droning hard. Depending on their build i prefer transferring into 2 base swarmhost nydus but there are many builds you can follow this up with!

I've been putting a lot of effort into understanding HotS ZvP now that it's out. I haven't played the Beta much due to lag issues

I'd like to share it

First of all

Against, it's way too risky to skip that. From what I've seen, Protosses who want to play the macro game almost always go Stargate. They can also all in from 2 base after a Stargate opening, but that's pretty rare. The most common opening is Pheonix, with the occasional Oracle. 

If they're not going Stargate, so it only got better in HotS.

Against a Stargate into a third base

* I stay on a single Evolution chamber
* Hydra Den around 8:30 if I scout the Stargate ahead of time
* Infestation pit and 5th + 6th gases as soon as third base drops (usually around 9 minutes or so);
* 10-12 Hydras for map control
* I start a fourth base and the geysers there as soon as possible.

The Infestation Pit has a great

Now

* If it's Colossus, prepare Infestor tech and double upgrades, getting ready for the Storm switch and for the late game, if I can't break the Protoss;
* If it's not Colossus, I start a Spire. I don't know exactly how many to make, maybe 12-14 should be good. Using Storm against Swarm Hosts is almost suicidal for the Protoss; you wittle them down very quickly if they don't have Colossus, their Force Fields run out eventually. They can't possibly attack into Swarm Host/Hydra without Colossus.

* ZvZ: [Replay](http://drop.sc/273451)

In this game, but using the proper timings mentioned in my ZvZ guide (again, a little greedier) I do manage to avoid dying. 3 queen openers are a good unit. Then, I get my mutas up and he decides to try and kill me while securing his third with spores. I had a feeling that if he lost his roach army he would have nothing at home afterwards, so I accept the losses (lost my third), and bolted over to his base with muta/ling. I kill his third basically for free, and his counterswing does almost no damage (thanks to some clutch mineral (gas) walking. The mutas killed his third, the mutas killed his roach army multiple times...the game was won. I transitioned into roach/infestor double upgrades and, lots of super close moments. Key things to note: I didn't lose ANY mutas (until a shitty fight at the end, traded 200minerals/200gas for ~200-300 energy...not worth it. Just use the mutas for map control (if he moves out then fly in from all directions).

* ZvP: [Replay](http://drop.sc/273453) Awesome game.

I open gasless 3 hatch, took my fourth and droned hard. I get my mutas up (and double ups), and simply out-produce him. He goes full retard and engages at his watchtower, I kill his army and easily win the game. 24 mutas, 80+ drones, and the rest 2/2 lings with the infestor transition started (and baneling nest for style :D ). In ZvP you need to do economic damage to make them worthwhile. I guess I got lucky that I was able to kill his army for free; if he was postured more defensively then I would've had to use counterattacks and multiprong to try and fight my way back in.

If you ever notice your opponent delaying storm too much...go mass baneling! Seriously

IMO ZvP mutas relies on obtaining a huge macro lead through the map control you get from mutas

* ZvT: [Replay](http://drop.sc/273454)

Sweet ZvT really. He opens CC first, I counterattack with speedlings and win the game. I killed so many SCVs, then I retreat and (sort of) save my third. He kills it a minute later, but I still saved it in my opinion :) A double expand and infestor transition later I win with a broodlord push. I killed some SCVs with mutas, but turrets are really good when you only make 13 or so mutalisks.

ZvT Mutas: 

-**Always** counterattack with muta/speedling. If he isn't in his base

-Get baneling speed. I forgot it, which will give you a tremendous edge against bio-based armies.

-Transition quickly into hive. This is the best way to do it IMO. If you can do enough damage with your mutas

- Always keep a healthy unit count. Droning to 80 is nice

-Fast double upgrades are dope. I forgot 3/3 until super late this game

* Closing Notes

I hope you guys enjoyed reading and/or watching the replays! I think that mutalisks are a great, so powerful, and you can easily win lost games just by doing this.

1368144307.0,1e1bqy,Roach hydra against Terran,WistopherWalken,18,1,13,"I really feel like roach hydra is constantly being written off as an inferior unit composition. It's been working very well for me to the effect that I am currently 70% in ZvT at the midmasters level. For me the the matchup has become a bit of a formula. I open with the standard 15 hatch, then spend about 12 supply in a ling timing attack just as speed finishes. Once speed finishes


This runby works well with roach hydra style because it really helps you secure a couple of advantages that are important for roach hydra. First and foremost, roach hydra trades very effectively against bio and is mostly immune to mines. Faster upgrades means that you are essentially able to hit two very powerful timings that have a good chance of denying the terran third, something I take a fourth behind. 


Of course these situations are pretty circumstantial. One assumes that you have done damage to the terran economically


Another advantage of roach hydra is your ability to pick off medivacs while you engage the terran army. This basically makes their bio much more fragile and also heavily limits their ability to drop


As I've mentioned before, however, proper spine placement, creep spread, overlord spread (research ovie speed every time), and army splitting means that you don't really need to take any damage from drops. Another weakness is that it gets melted if you were behind on upgrades, but then again, roach hydra will not be a winning composition on its own. It is less supply efficient than terran bio

Some good choices:


1. Broodlords - Great for forming a sort of barrier between terran and yourself. Really messes with the bio AI too. Also helps against mines and siege tanks.

2. Infestors - not my favorite option but really makes up for the lack of aoe in roach hydra. Also useful for keeping concave

3. Ultrakisks - always a good choice except that you need to start down the road of melee upgrades.

4. Vipers - my go to choice


Some situations to consider:

-Playing from behind - I find that you really need a solid economy to pump out roach hydra

-High tank count - tanks will slaughter your roach hydra unless you can catch them unsieged or get a full (I mean full) surround. If you see them transitioning into large amounts of tanks

-Attacking without concave - don't do it

What I use is a modified version of a build that Nestea used in a GSL. First I will reprint Nestea's build

Nestea's original:

(text is from http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=360647)
 Fast 3 base mutalisks 
Originally done by Nestea in the GSL

While any fast mutalisk build works
1) Fast gas after third (~4:30)
2) First 100 gas into ling speed
3) Drone up as usual
4) If you scout no gateway all-in
5) If you scout robo
6) 2x gas at 7:00-7:30
If he all-ins, reinforcing lings stay in your spine forest.
If he expands

------

My Mods:

I do three things different:

1. TIMINGS - I switch the ling speed and lair timing

2. NINJA A BASE - Before the protoss ever pushes out, i take the top left.

3. NYDUS -  it costs you 3 mutas total

3.1 -DRONES - insta- drone transfer to your new 3rd / future bases. This one requires some explanation...  Anyway, but you just want him to be slow. Once he finally arrives at my third, guess what he finds there? Literally nothing. I pull every drone and the queen from my 3rd and super / resaturate my natural (I say re-saturate because you will have thrown down a shit ton of spine crawlers, I usually use natural drones for this). You can then move these drones to Ninja'ed expansions...for example, if you natural is supersaturated due to pulling the drones before his army gets there, then you can then nydus them over to the third. I dont always build the nydus...You CAN simply transfer the drones all the way across the map, too...the reason is the protoss's build is so incredibly streamlined that they basically scout NO WHERE.. they just go straight to your third... you could probably even take their third in most cases just to be a dick...watch some replays
in another scenario

3.2 - LINGS the second use of the nydus
note that the text from teamliquid.net says you should leave lings in your spine forest. with the nydus
MOST IMPORTANT POINT ABOUT THE NYDUS. Often he will have just enough stalkers to where you dont want to engage. If you get a nydus up in his main during the chaos

4. UPGRADES: Mutalisk upgrades are incredibly

Just to be clear, ever (I mean you can buy enough time to get to BL composition, no doubt.. if it makes sense do it. But really my goal is to annoy the shit out of him till he moves out, then i crush his bases). Against the immortal sentry all in, this is so beautiful because it makes all the gas he invests in sentries for forcefields worthless.... sentries are literally the worst possible thing he could build b/c they are low DPS and because I never try to engage him... except to slow him down on the way over, so they just sit there with 200 energy.

I stress that, you are still going to win the base trade scenario REALLY easily.

--other stuff that works really well--
I also try to snipe the warp prism if I think I can get it. This usually requires that your opponent is worse than you because he should be moving out earlier than you..

Again

Always keep an eye out for an opportunity to crush his attacking army. He will be so worried about his main base that often you can either crush his main army with speedling that youve been banking behind the spines in the natural, you can just fly across the map with your flock.

GENERAL THEORY - What makes this build so incredibly abusive is two things:

You know the protoss's objective MINUTES in advance (kill your third). You do not COUNTER his build.. rather you completely SIDESTEP it. You ignore his entire army, masturbating.

The protoss has to streamline so many things to make this build work that he misses basic things, he will be so preoccupied with mutas he probably wont find it.

TL;DR, is stupidly easy to beat using mutas, nyduses, spines, and inducing a base trade. You'll have to practice a few times, but once you get it its GG no RE.

1334448944.0,sa60r,Zerg Injection Methods,Hachrt,20,3,21,"I thought a topic like this might be a good one to have in r/allthingszerg

As far as I know there are 5 commonly used injection methods:

* Double-tap Method
* Brood War Method
* Backspace Method
* Minimap Method
* Camera Hotkey Method (Darkgrid Method)

I will now explain the methods as best as I understand them

The Double-tap Method works with the idea that, 6, and 7 with all hatcheries on 4 leaving hotkeys 1, 2, and 3 open for Units.  The depression of keys for injecting turns out looking like 55v66v77v clicking on the hatchery the queen is next to each time after pressing V.  Proponents for this method say it's easier to micro individual queens this way as well.  

* TL;DR:  Queens separated on hotkeys 5
* Two notable players that use this method are QxG.Destiny and col.CatZ. Reportedly

The Brood War Method works on the same principle as the Double-tap method in that you're double tapping your hotkeys to bring you to your hatchery's location, and 3 and then every hatchery on 4 in order to spend larva more easily.  The key depression thus looks something like 11v22v33v clicking on the Queen before pressing v and then clicking on the hatchery after pressing v.  This setup is normally used, as far as I'm aware, if the player played a lot of Starcraft Brood War and they haven't changed their hotkey set-up much, hence the name.

* TL;DR Hatcheries which have queens are separate on 1, all hatcheries are on 4, double tap a hotkey, click on the queen, press v, click on the hatchery, repeat.
* Liquid.Sheth and Liquid.Zenio are two notable players that use this style

The Backspace Method and Minimap Method are similar.  Both methods have all their hatcheries on one hotkey and all of their queens on the next.  Both methods select their queens, will use right shift instead of left shift to allow them to press backspace easier. The player will then, while holding down shift, press backspace and click on hatcheries that have queens next to them.  A player that uses Minimap injections can then click, as implied by the name, on hatcheries via the Minimap in order to inject while continuing to hold down shift.  The biggest downside to these methods, especially the Minimap method, if this happens the stop and hold position hotkeys are your friend.

* TL;DR: All hatcheries on 4, press V. Press Backspace and click on hatcheries with a queen next to them or Click on hatcheries via the minimap. Changing your hotkeys for the backspace method is recommended, Common Variation to this method is to rebind the ""cycle base camera"" function to the Spacebar or the Grave Key `~ .
* Another Variation of the Backspace Inject method can be found [here](http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=315549).

* Note: With the backspace method you *can* leave your queens unhotkeyed and select them for injecting as you cycle through your bases.

The Screen Hotkey Method is actually something I've only seen used in the [Darkgrid Layout](http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=257590) and the idea is similar to the Backspace Method. With the Darkgrid Layout you have your camera hotkeys layered with your normal keys and that those layered cameras to switch bases rather cycling through bases with backspace. Using this method is somewhat tricky at first, that's fine with the way the hotkeys are set-up.) and press the button that the Camera is supposed to be on.  Your first base is Q your second base is W, your third base is D, your fourth is A, and your fifth is S, and your macro hatchery is on F (the reason E is skipped is because that's the key that Spawn Larva is on).  Having these camera keys is useful for more than simply injecting, they're also great for helping deal with drop harass among other applications. While injecting you select your queens, press and hold Shift, thumb on alt, it's more accurate than the backspace method with some added benefits. 

* TL;DR: With the Darkgrid Layout: Press and hold shift, press Q, click mouse to inject, press W, click mouse to inject, Press D, click mouse to inject
* TSL_Revival uses a custom Camera Hotkey setup and does not hotkey his queens to inject.  I don't know his exact method,False,,t5_2tkq6,True,,,t3_sa60r

This is a quick and easy technique that can be used to put single ling in multiple different scouting locations.  Assume for this explanation that your main army is control group 1.

Step 1: Hit 1 to select your army.

Step 2: A-move your army to the location where you would like a single zergling to scout.

Step 3: Quickly

Step 4: With your remaining army still selected

Repeat steps 2-4 for every location you want to have a single scout ling.

Step 5: With your remaining army still selected

This technique allows you to A-move a single zergling to each of multiple different locations very quickly

At least ZVZ's that involved me building roaches. I always went with the ling/infestor/ultra style. But that style is simply not viable on some maps (Like Ohana, Entombed Valley, Shak Plateau.) 

This meant I would sometimes have to play standard roach based zvz. This would basically always make me lose. I just didn't know how to navigate the match up. 

But then I came up with 5 steps that have lead to me winning most of  my zvz's. I actually enjoy the match up now

Note: This will probably not work for people who are above mid-masters. But it's been working for me pretty well at a lower/mid master level. 

So here are the 5 steps.

1. Don't die to anything stupid. (Ling all-ins.)
2. Try to snipe their third
3. Macro (Roach/infestor - hyrdas once you have your third saturated)
4. Try to snipe a base as you/they are trying to take a 4th. You can snipe a base with burrowed infestors
5. Wait for them to do something stupid. 

I've found that if you just macro
Like attacking into a choke
Seriously

Once I stopped trying to force engagement or make anything happen in the late game

It seems like zergs just don't know how to handle the late game. Obviously this won't work in top masters or above. Since they will know how to handle the late game

Once I changed my mindset from ""trying to win"" to ""waiting for them to throw the game away"". I started winning a lot more ZVZs. 

Hopefully this is helpful to you in some way.

I am Gold league (At the platinum end). I think I play near perfect for the first 6 minutes. Money shoots up in the mid-game. I think it is because I do not have enough gas maybe. Or my macro hatch is late. The bigger issue is I have no idea what I am doing in ZvP. Could someone tell me when I should be getting gas / roach warren at the start. I usually go 3 base. (I am still at the level where 1 base Protoss crops up from time to time... so exceptions apply)

I want to play safe. I do not need to play a perfect game. How many units should I have at what time to be able to reinforce and hold an attack? Or when I scout at 7 minutes what should I be looking for to identify the 2 base all in? Hell what unit composition should I have. I really have no idea?

",6,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/allthingszerg/comments/x5yxl/zergs_most_economical_opening/,"Hello, I'm a Mid Masters - High Masters Zerg and this thought has been playing on my mind for a while now since Homestory Cup. 

I remember Idra stating during a cast that most zergs don't tend to drone scout when they hatch first these days because if the enemy overlord sees your drone coming he can just throw down a 15 pool into 15 hatch instead and come out more economically ahead. 

Ever since he said that i've been contemplating WHY zergs have been going hatch first if thats the case. I went into a few custom games and tested how economical Pool Into hatchery is in terms of larvae production and have found out a few things.

** 15 Pool Into 15 Hatchery **

* The Natural hatchery should finish around 4:20 which is when it starts producing larvae

* The 2nd queen should also finish by the time the first inject finishes roughly. Which Means your 2nd and 3rd Inject Cycle Finishes at 5:30.

* Which in total means by the 5:30 mark this opening has left you with a total of 3 inject cycles completed (12 Larvae) and the expansion should have spawned in total 4-5 Larvae (1 every 15 seconds).

* Which means a total of 16-17 larvae has produced between 4:20 and 5:30

** 15 HATCH 16 POOL **

* Your natural expansion should finish around 3:50 which is when it starts producing larvae every 15 seconds. both of your queens should have also been started by now.

* By 5:25 Your 1st and 2nd Inject cycle should now be finishing which means 8 larvae have been produced by the queens at this point.

* Your natural expansion has been left to produce 1 larvae every 15 seconds for 1minute 40 seconds which is 6-7 larvae.

* So in conclusion this means a total of 14-15 larvae has been produced in comparison to the 16-17 of the pool first build. 

So my question is fellow zergs. Why are so many of us still going hatch first in the match up of ZvT and ZvZ if Pool first is actually more economical and safer against early pools / funky barracks pressure. Or is there something i've overlooked during this whole investigation.

Would love to hear your feedback.

Heres my opener.

* 15 hatch
* 15 pool 
* 17 gas
* 16 OL (save money after and when your OL pops 2 queens and 3 sets of lings)
* 24 spine
* 24 bane nest (before speed)

Then get speed and take 1 guy off of gas.

* note: If he goes 15 hatch. send your lings. You might get a free queen if he was greedy. If he goes 14 14 he will have speed before you and you don't want to lose your first 6 lings.

* Can be risky on 2 player maps as it can be vulnerable to 6/7/8/9/10 pools
At this point you need to be very aware of ling all ins or a bane bust. Build mass ling/banelings accordingly. Block your ramp with queens if you need to.

Drone during passive times. You need to be aware as possible of his tech and army/drone count to know if hes all inning you.

Once you are at 44-52 drones, Roach Warren, and a Evo Chamber(for upgrades and in case they go for mutas)). As you build structures, replace the drone. Once you have money, before everything pops, start your third base. (assuming hes not all inning you).

When your buildings finish, build drones.

Once you have droned your third you should have pathogen glands almost complete and +2 missle range on the way. Do another timing on +2


This is a really basic ZvZ build that a lot of good players will do. I hope it helps stir up the brain for new ideas and get you out of the habit of cheesing every time you end up with a ZvZ.

1355205524.0,14nhm0,[D] A redesign of the Infestor/Swarm Host,EsperCraft,19,4,31,"I've really been thinking about the Infestor after this patch and I'm fully aware this post will result in no change

I'm not going to include Neural Parasite in this post as it's very rarely used in high level play.  I've always viewed the Infestor as a support caster either bolstering your own army (infested terran) or hampering the enemy army (fungal growth).  However

**New Ability: Desecration**

* Energy Cost: 75 [same as fungal]
* Radius: 2 [same as fungal]
* Duration: 4 seconds [same as fungal]
* Range: 11
* Description: Desecrates the ground and air snaring ground units and slowing air units by 75% after 1 second.  Units affected by Desecrate have their armor reduced by 1 and are revealed if cloaked for 4 seconds.  Effect can stack.

*Rationale:*
I never liked Fungal doing damage.  When Blizzard put in the +dmg to armored I felt like this was a band-aid fix and stubbornness to not buff Hydralisks.  As far as Fungal Growth being a missile...fungus grow on the ground, (3) Variation in the use of the ability

The third point is really what I want for Zerg more than anything else.  It pains me watching SC2 matches where amazing warp prism micro, or force field placement literally tip the battle in the favor of the player with better control.  I love watching these plays but I lament the fact that aside from setting up flanks and good baneling movement there is little Zerg can do to influence a fight.  My proposed desecrate ability can be used in a multitude of ways not just lock down the army and either chain fungal or a-move to win.  You can desecrate on an army to force them to move, behind an army to force them to stay, block retreat paths, cut off flanks, cast them quickly to stack the debuff, cast them spread apart to hold an army in place


**New Ability: Morph to Swarm Host**

* Cost: 100 minerals
* Duration: 30s
* Requires Hive

**Swarm Host New Ability: Host Infested Terran**

* Cooldown: 30s
* Description:  The Swarm Host spawns an Infested Terran and hosts it within its body.  The Swarm Host can hold up to 5 Infested Terrans.

**Swarm Host New Ability: Release Swarm**

* Cooldown: 0s
* Description:  The Swarm Host releases all Infested Terrans it has spawned.  The Swarm Host must be burrowed to use this ability.

*Rationale:*
The idea of Zerg having a primary general use unit and having it morph into a specialized unit (Hydra=&gt; Lurker, Overlord=&gt;Overseer) is a cornerstone of the Zerg tech structure in my opinion.  The Swarm Host becomes a specialized Infestor losing its multiple spells and specializing in Infested Terrans.  The biggest issue I've seen with Swarm Hosts is they need to be baby sat because (1) they don't spawn locusts very quickly and (2) the locusts don't hit air.  Therefore they don't actually feel ""Zergy"" because they force your army to become immobile.  Swarm Hosts with the new proposed abilities provide army support, can be used to harass, can function just like the swarm host and ""siege"" a position at spawn intervals (but now it requires micro to release them).  Infestors can spawn up to 8 Infested Terrans at full energy, Swarm Hosts can only have up to 5 but they are released immediately.  Again, I think this gives a greater diversity to the strategies Zerg can do.

*  What upgrades to prioritize? Both for air and ground units?

1360886979.0,18jsyt,More Theorycrafting: Overseer at Evolution Chamber Tech,EsperCraft,15,4,49,"Everybody's been throwing up theorycrafting the last couple days so I thought I'd jump in too.  Moving both burrow and overlord speed to hatch tech was supposed to give Zerg more options to tech laterally without the vertical requirement of Lair tech.  Even still we're finding that the gas investment is the true limiting factor in many cases

I propose that the Overseer be moved to evolution chamber instead of Lair as the requirement.  The base movement speed is faster than an overlord (move OL speed back to Lair) and contaminate has the ability to disturb the macro of the opponent (the same effect as burrowing to deny expansions

* 35 second evolution chamber build time
* 17 second morph time
* 133 second energy gain time

The standard zerg macro opener involves gas around 6 minutes which would provide some nice options for gas allocation aside from roach

How would this change affect each matchup?

* **ZvP** - Immortal/sentry as the premiere early-game push will have to be careful with the overseer available earlier.  a 6 minute start to overseer would time out right around the 9 minute mark
* **ZvT** - The early overseer helps with scouting more than anything else.  Being able to identify the number of each production structure tells a lot about what's coming.  I know cloak banshees have fallen out of favor but the detection will also help with early widow mine contains so you don't have to creep crawl with a spore to clear a mine at your third.
* **ZvZ** - Honestly, it will allow for play that disturbs your opponent beyond a baneling bust.

It's important to remember that contaminate is not a guaranteed proposition.  If it gets killed en route to whatever it's going to contaminate

TLDR; I think moving overseer to require evolution chamber instead of Lair would do the following 3 things in a general sense:

* Dissuades macroing on small numbers of production facilities
* Allows the zerg to disturb macro without actually attacking
* Increases zerg gas allocation early game,False,,t5_2tkq6,False,,Master NA,t3_18jsyt

So lets think back to the good old days when fruitdealer was around. He would get drop and burrow every single game and it pretty much won him a GSL title. No matter what you think of the play back then it has completely fallen off the scene for pretty much no reason other than people cutting corners. 

Recently Hyun and Symbol have been throwing in drop builds now and then but you hardly ever see the upgrade even though it isn't expensive (if you compare it to the cost of medivacs and warp prisms and rather than losing the investment you just lose an overlord so it only gets more cost effective the more you use it). You see burrow a good deal more but never with drop and overlord speed. 

So recently ive started simply winning games easily like the games were not even a little bit close by getting all 3 upgrades fast. It works best in ZvP from what ive seen like ive taken down players doing blink stalker all ins by just burrowing lings for instance. Ive won against sentry immortal both with baneling drops

Even mid game and late game it is great so why don't people do it more is my question? It seems like something that is incredibly imbalanced if you have good decision making. If you want some replays I can show some off but its pretty self explanatory. 

Side note: if you are below diamond id suggest having 1 overlord hidden away with 4 banelings and when you spot them leaving their base shift queue the drop in and kill the probes at an expo.

HotS rolls in and I am completely garbage with Terran and Protoss. Well, my TvZ is 67% and TvP is 56%.

But I really dislike the current TvX and PvX match-ups, but before stopping I decided to play some Unraked Zerg just to see if I could find some enjoyment in SC2, and to my surprise, it was quite fun. Even without knowing any BO/timings of Zerg, I still managed to have fun even when losing. Swam Hosts are incredibly fun to use, and Mutas are like Phoenix, but better and I dare to say

I enjoy Ling/Bling/Muta style a lot, in fact, my Zerg basic mechanics are pretty garbage. I can keep good injects for the first 8min, but thats about it. I have some general idea of unit compositions, and what to build, but I have no idea what the timings for gas, tech builds

Good day my fellow Cerebrates!


It saddens me to see the number of Cerebrate younglings who are having trouble combating our lesser brethren known as the Protoss.
So I've gone to great effort in an attempt to prove the lesser Protoss Executors (of rank Platinum and below) can be crushed with nothing more than the simple Zergling.


**There were two stages to my plan:**


The first was to masquerade as a lesser Cerebrate in order to lure the weaker Executors into battle

I was wondering how some other high level zerg players tend to open against terran players that might be going mech
If I open with roach ling I feel at a disadvantage to any marine maurader medivac pushes if the terran went for fast double upgrades.


Not only do i have trouble identifying its actually mech until its too late but I also have trouble getting a composition that can actually deal with the pushes. if the terran opens up reactor hellion banshee


And on the off chance I do manage to actually hold on until the late game vs a meching terran blue flame hellions can dismantle my slow broodlord army by picking away at my income. I feel like you need an absurd amount of spine crawlers in order to actually kill the hellions before they make it behind your mineral line and fire 3 shots off to roast an entire drone line.

Given the popularity of FFE in ZvP, but a 12 pool 14 hatch allowed me a certain amount of flexibility in the early game which I love. This entire build is predicated on the idea that Protoss is fast expanding. I am playing at the high platinum level so we can’t say tip top play but the concept I am aiming for is a way to punish exceedingly greedy play while transitioning into a 3 hatch, delayed Stephano Style ZvP.  Even if Protoss is going cannon first, and shuts down the aggression cold the Zerg is still at an ok place and well able to recover.


The Build Order
*9 Overlord
*3 Drones
*12 Pool 
*14 Hatch
*6 Zerglings
*17 Overlord
*1 Queen
*21 Hatch

**The Beginning Phases**


In this build we go without scouting and instead use our 2nd overlord at the natural to approximate the position of the Protoss. The inbound direction of Probe and Time of arrival will indicate the best order to send first initial zerglings. Probe and Pylon blocking can be problematic


1.	Forge
    

    a.	Pretty common on smaller maps


    b.	Smart Protoss will pull probes


2.	Nexus First
    

    a.	On larger maps this aggression comes at a very awkward time against Nexus first


3.	Forge
    

    a.	Again the discerning Protoss will count your Drones and suspect something cheeky is going to be happening. Part of the reason I like to get that hatch down and hopefully have it scouted is to encourage the idea that I am not committed to aggression but defense with that earlier pool


    i.	In the case of a full wall his nexus is delayed.
    

    ii.	Forge


    b.	In these cases we take map control from the Protoss handily. With six zerglings, and otherwise hold complete control over the map. 

There are also a few scenarios


1.	Proxy Gateways
    a.	Non issue with a spine (or queens)


2.	Cannon Rushs
    a.	Essentially hard countered unless there is superb pylon positioning.

I was kind of surprised to see people having a lot of trouble with protoss

Notes: This kind of relies on your opponent not being a little bitch and turtling. If they just keep taking bases and walling with buildings

Build: Standard 3 hatch opening vs FFE

09 overlord

15 pool

16 hatch

15 overlord

15 2x lings

-- 3 sequential queens. You want the first one from the main, then spread creed/go to the third
24 hatch

24 overlord

30 overlord

-- drones~~

@6:00 double gas

@6:30 if toss has gas no gas at natural -&gt; roach warren

(If you see a pheonix, and just build drones. A stargate opening delays any all in from protoss considerably)

@first 100 gas: lair

macro hatch when your minerals run high.

@7:00 roach warren/evo (+1 range

@second 100 gas -&gt; speed

@60 drones: UNITS. Pure roach ling until you see a third. 

@toss third: Take fourth

@100% lair -&gt; infestation pit

@100% infestation pit -&gt; Hive

@100% hive -&gt; adrenal/ultralisk cavern

@100% ultralisk cavern -&gt; You should have enough gas for 8-9 ultras. (These pop ~14 minutes)

THINGS TO NOTE:
After protoss takes a third, and overlords

Ultras WILL pop for any 3 base collosus push. Don't engage with pure lings unless he's literally sitting on one of your mining bases. 

If you see voidrays at any point -&gt; drop a hydra den. DO NOT SPEND MONEY ON HYDRAS YET. Kill his army with the ultra/ling ball first

Worst case scenario, start pathogen glands, and get a hydra/infestor ball. (Start range upgrades too). Hydra infestor beats mass voids pretty handily.

My play style is very macro heavy currently, vZ: ling flood.  If I scout it and hold, I find I'm unable to trade cost-efficiently v midgame terran and protoss.  My vZ games never make it that far.

My questions for ya'll:

* should I shift my play style to a more aggressive early game with a later expand?

* mutas vT midgame are useless due to cannons/marines/widow mines. Should I waste gas on infestors or rush to ultras?

* my swarm hosts (with hydra and roach back up) get creamed against colo/immortal if I push. Am I relegated to turtling?

Sorry no replays guys (at work right now and seething over almost-straight losses two nights in a row).  I hope I've explained my problems a little better.  I know my macro could use some improvement

* Swarm hosts as the back bone of the late game zerg army as either a way to cause free damage or force engagements
* Building of excessive static defense at key points of the map
* Use of fungal's new range as a way to deal with slow units that clump
* Holding fragile units like hydras back until after splash damage was removed by locusts

1348591872.0,10ghcw,Mutaless ZvZ,roym899,15,2,19,"Hi
I've actually losing every ZvZ right now. It was my best matchup back when I was Diamond league and below. I've opened 14/14 put on some pressure and macro'd behind it. I've never done any Bling all-ins or anything like this. I had no buildorder no timings or whatsoever maped out though and only played by feeling. It worked perfectly. The only thing I had trouble with is Ling/Infestor -&gt; Ultralisk style. But as it is quite uncommon on ladder this wasn't a big deal for me.
Now I switched to Hatch First as it is more common these days and just the better macro opener I suppose. But my ZvZ is so bad since I switched. (probably 2 months ago or so) Right now I'm on a 10 game losing streak and I always lose no matter what my opponent does.
Once I lose against Bling All-Ins, then against Roach/Infestor, then against Ling/Infestor. It's like everytime I now my mistake against one composition. I get owned by another one. I really don't like to use mutas in this matchup. They don't seems stable to me at all, because you don't have any roaches when they pop normally. And a well performed timing would kill you. (atleast that's what I did back in diamond, where I won every game against muta players)
Roach/Hydra loses against Mass muta I feel and Roach/Infestor is pretty annoying to deal with Mutas.
Ling/Infestor seems to be pretty strong to me

Right, gets tech and takes his third.  

Normally, and macro up.  Just as it becomes time to make units, I see the Protoss player move to take his third.  It's on Akilon Wastes.  By the time I have a half decent army, I know he'll have a gateway/cannon wall up at the third, and a wall at the front, so I take a fourth, then get my army together.  

After checking the replay, from here all I want to do is trade roughly evenly, and eventually I'll win.  But against a wall, with FF's, a couple of voids, and a colossi or two, I can seem to find absolutely no way to trade without easily losing double the resources.  Any corruptors I add get shredded


I notice it's not going well, by the time he's been allowed to sit on 6 gasses, he just walks out with a (what I've found to be) fairly unkillable comp (void, colossi, zealot, storm I think) army and pushes for the gg.

Everything I've read has told me that, and should focus on denying the third of a protoss, but if the protoss isn't hitting a timing, that third can be taken at around 8 minutes, which is just when I'm finishing up droning, and have no real army to speak of.  So by the time I do, it's pretty well defended.  Maybe it's just Akilon, that defending both is a cinch.  

Is there something fundamental I'm missing
If a Protoss is ever foolish enough to leave his wall before we've started trading, I really struggle.

Any proposed solutions?

So zergs must do what they have done throughout their whole existence in Starcraft 2, (and the 30% is only due to my terrible ability to hold ling bane all ins)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Let's get to the point of the subject, and gas afterwards. Then we get the normal 100 gas speed and 50 gas banes to be safe. Shortly after we will have extra gas. What do we do with that gas? Well usually we spend that on banelings but if we're being defensive we don't know if that investment is going to do anything, also we can make them quickly in an emergency so maybe we should do something else? So what I am suggesting is instead of banelings after the baneling nest just go straight to lair. We can get a head start on tech, while remaining safe (the gas we pool during the lair can be for those emergency banelings). Straight after lair we slap down a hydra den and 2 or 3 more gases (whatever you feel more comfortable with) and then afterwards double evolution chambers for upgrades, and if necessary get roaches. Going straight hydra speed sounds good to pick off overlords but its less important because almost every single zerg unit is faster than the hydralisk. So what I do is go range first then speed, this means in the worst case scenario where my roaches are late and they're attacking me I can tank with lings and shoot from a distance with hydra to hold.






                                                                                                                                       
TL;DR: normal 15/16 hatch 15/16 pool 16/17 gas @100 gas speed @ 50 gas banelings @ 100 gas lair @ 100% lair hydralisk den @ 60/70% hydra den 2/3 more gases. @ 3 gases 100% double evolution chamber @ 100 hydra den get range upgrade. If you would like roaches get it @ 50% hydra den maybe more. When you have around 6 or 7 hydras and some lings then you may take your third, and you don't scout it fast enough to defend with your lings, then you deserve the losses you get.
                                                                                                        
If he goes mass baneling to kill your hydras then that's where roaches can come in to play to tank for the hydras. However if you're not feeling the roach you can burrow your hydras after spreading them OR you can do what I do

In my last game, concentrating on thors and tanks, so I decide to go for broods as fast as possible while still getting upgrades for roaches. (I had the economy and my macro wasn't the greatest). So I get a few broods and start to engage, then he brings out a wall of vikings and kills the broodlords easily, and my roaches melt.

Check techs into Hydralisks on 3 bases, and with some great force-fields holds the attack, denies the 4th base, and pushes into Check's 3rd.

This style basically comes alive at the beginning of the mid-game.  You do what you can to take little to no damage to early pressure from the protoss.  I get to three bases asap, then I build a bunch of spores and drones while moving my ovies over the building spores.   Once I get my lair I start building the spire.  


From here it's pretty basic.

**if they went stargate then you need to get corrupters as well as your mutas.  

**Start taking extra bases every chance you get.  This is the crux of the style is getting up to 10+ geysers.  

**You need to be managing your control so that you are keeping the protoss back in their base and not expanding.  Keeping them in their base gives you the map control to mass expand and keep taking more geysers



The main things that this seems to be weak against are:
  
**lots of warp-ins/run-bys to your satellite gas bases

**army-wise HT's with storm and archons can whittle down your mutas pretty well

 I stumbled upon two pretty useful resources to use for getting your build orders nailed down. I used to resort to having a notepad on my desk
 
* Part A) Monkey Bot arcade game - starcraft://map/1/203387

This is a build order tester with a really great 'restart' feature


* Part B) - SC2 Scrapbook
http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=287794

This is an app that creates an overlay on your screen with your build order. I think it'd be pretty lame to use this in competitive games

One caveat

=== MorroW's notes ===

How widow mine works

they lock onto a target. first one who enter within 5 range OR best unit (which is basically the closest unit to the widow mine)
once they lock into a target it begins channeling for 1.5 seconds (ingame)

If the unit leaves the 5 range

so this is why mines sometimes dont attack

so lets say you run in with zerglings against marines and a widow mine. the widow mine locks onto the first zergling who enters.

if the zergling dies to marines

if the zergling runs past the widow mine

I am new to this subreddit and to the game itself so please don't be harsh on me :) Also

Backstory (for interested): I own SC2 since release. I played some ranked matches with friends back then but it wasn't something serious or whatever you would like to call it... I just wasn't really interested in that type of thing. Sometimes I launched SC2, back again in SC2, playing some ladder games.

------
So... This cute matchmaker placed me in the silver 1v1 league. I am the Zerg player (EU server) and I have some problems as a newb. Well, units, skills, upgrades, etc.) so it is not THAT bad. The biggest problem for me is maintaining the eco. Either I have a lot of everything but it is too late to make an army or I have almost nothing, with pretty decent army, yet other people still manage to outnumber me. I know that the practice is the big factor here

I think that the problem lies in the Drones. It really hurts that I have to ""sacrifice"" one to build something. Generally I see this as putting myself behind the enemy and destroying my own eco. It is something that my mind cannot comprehend it on it's own.

I can't find any help on the internet. I mean, so if any of you know this types of videos, I would be really grateful for links. I watched Apollo's REVAMPED Tutorials and they were great, but it would be nice if I had something else to watch.

I know I can do better. I played lots of 2v2 games with my friend (who is as skilled as me) this season and we are placed against platinium/diamond players. I just don't know how to rely on myself in 1v1 battles.

I hope I will recive some tips from you guys.

Thanks for your time and help in advance.

First off, not even under new, not even when I logged out. So if it was visible, I apologize for the repost

Let's look at the numbers

ZvT: 


Against a bio style

Against mech, both missile and melee upgrades greatly benefit the anti-mech army's DPS. Missile upgrades obviously benefit roaches as well as infested terrans, and melee upgrades help broodlings/ultras/lings. I recommend skipping carapace upgrades if you're playing against a meching player.

ZvP:
Carapace upgrades aren't worthless in this matchup, 3 base, +3 ground weapons) push. That way stalkers get shredded by Zerglings, but I think that stronger roaches/IT make up for the weaker Zerglings.

The integrated wiki is basically what it sounds like

Right now allthingszerg constantly has posts that go over build orders, stream information, and other information that is scattered about usually found in comments or self posts.  When you are trying to find an answer to a question, you are left using the (poor) reddit search, or by making a self post.  This isn't very fast, reliable, or accurate.

I am hoping that we can use the wiki to collect information so that you can easily and quickly find the answer to questions like ""who is daisuki"" or ""how do I beat the immortal sentry allin""

Thank you my fellow Zerg brethren and I hope to see you on the wiki!  It is open as you are reading this (tab on the top on the homepage)

*(Please remember all information we know about HotS can/will change. All discussion of HotS strategy is also just theory-crafting.)*



**CURRENT ZERG HOTS CHANGES**

*New Units*

* **Viper** - 100m/200g (3 supply/40 seconds build) - 3 abilities :-

*1) Consume* - damages a friendly building for 200 damage over 10 seconds

*2) Abduct* - pulls an enemy unit towards the viper (7 range) (can currently pull revealed cloaked/burrowed units)

*3) Blinding cloud* - Creates a cloud that reduces the attack range of biological units in the AoE to 1 (melee). Same AoE/range as fungal.


* **Swarm host** - 200m/100g (3 supply) - has a 3 second burrow (no research of burrow required to use)

   :- *Locusts* - Last 15 seconds (25 seconds with 200m/200g upgrade). 2 range (can hit air/ground) and 16(!) damage
     
         
          
          
*Upgrades/changes to existing /Zerg units*

* Hydralisk Upgrade – Muscular Augmentation - (150m/150g) hydralisks move 50% faster off creep (Hydras will now move the same speed whether on creep or not)

* Ultralisk Burrow – Ultralisks come with this ability innately. 7 range

* Overlord creep spread - Moved from a lair tech ability to evo chamber 

* Overseer - still in HotS

* Ultralisk frenzy - apparently removed

* ~~Baneling burrowed movement~~ Removed

 

*Cosmetic changes*

* New creep tumor spreading animation

* Creep is now much more pale on the minimap

* New queen model

* Slightly smaller Ultralisks

* Burrow/Unburrow on different hotkeys

So these are all the current changes for Zerg. Feel free to discuss anything related to zerg in HotS (although keep current balance discussion to a minimum)

1375913956.0,1jwy30,New StarCraft Player Questions,codyasmith,9,0,20,"Hi

I am new to SC2 and have no clue what I'm doing or what my opponent is doing.

Below I will tell you my weaknesses with SC2 being so new and I would love any/all constructive criticism.

My normal build is
drone up
send out overlord to their main to scout
10 Overlord
11th drone scouts
15 hatch
15 spawning pool
15 gas
throw 3 on gas upon completion
wait for spawning pool and hatch to finish

As soon as spawning pool finishes I get 1 queen per each base. I build 2-6 lings and then drone and overlord up.

I usually try to scout early game with drone and overlord and my overlord normally dies to a queen

Then I never scout their base again. I try to send overlords to all of the possible expos across the map

I don't know what to do with my scouting information or even how to scout their main bases without dying to stalkers

I just recently started leaving ~5 mutas near my bases to defend agaisnt drops in PvT and thats been amazing.

Any time I go econ
Any time I go army

I have no clue what to do when my opp walls in.

When I should go baneling nest
When should I get upgrades for any unit or evo chamber?

I always try to have ( n + 1 ) queens where n is the number of bases I have to larva inject and the extra queen to spread creep.

My queens always end at full energy cuz I'm bad.

I always have a shit ton of minerals and not enough gas.

I have no clue what kind of an army is good and normally amass a bunch of 1/1 zerglings or 2/2 lings with metabolic but not adrenal.

I dont know how to prepare for burrowed infestors

I try to get a ground army and a bunch of mutas and send them in on different flanks forcing his army to split up and or choose incorrectly.

I never build any unit thats not drone, hydra, ultra, and I rarely get any upgrade all game besides metabolic for lings.

I am really bad and would love help and suggestions with any/all of the above. Also I would love coaching from a highbie!

Thank you so much.

tl;dr - I suck and I'm good at whining

They said it shouldn't be done

They were probably right...but it still works :)

So, get a nydus network first, then a hydra den, and load up your queens/lings/hydras and rally units into the nydus.  From here, you can prettymuch just go and win.  Take out production and econ, maybe grab a third and transition into 1/1 roach hydra, slowly going for infestor tech.  You still have a nydus network if you haven't outright killed him, you can perform counter attacks with your otherwise immobile army.  Also
