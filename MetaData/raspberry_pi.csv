Camera using a freecycle'd Logitech Quickcam Chat, the router a Linksys that works 100% with DD-WRT. 

RPi running the bastard child of LinuxFromScratch and Arch. Entire OS built from source; glibc, modifications from patches submitted to the linux-rpi-kernel mailing list. 

Once the base system was cross compiled under a patched GCC (for floating point), and a some other stuff out of the arch source, but the core was built by me.

*****

When plugged in, where root is kept. We really need to come up with a way to forgo the SD requirement, imho. 

The HDD will boot up to a prompt

You can either attach IO to the RPi, I setup a script entitled 'ff' which launched ffserver and ffmpeg, and streamed to cam.mjpeg at 320x240@20fps with pretty good quality considering. 

The router was easily setup as a Wireless Bridge, I was able to take a lot of strain off the RPi regarding networking.. I'd discovered that when using wpa_supplicant wireless, it actually used a bit more cpu when streaming, and I wasn't able to reliably stream 320x240. When I streamed and hit max cpu, I was crashing the camera kernel modules. 

So, on ethernet, with minimal daemons running. If I dropped down to 160x120@10fps or 320x240@1fps, then I could run xfce, wireless, and so on.

If you expose SSH to the rest of the world
http://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/Network/SecuringSSH

Echoing and tailoring them specifically to the Raspbian Image:

1) Use strong passwords and usernames. 

*If you use the default password

I'd actually recommend using a new user and disabling the default pi user.

If they haven't already

2) Disable root login.

Unless you've enabled it

3) Disable protocol 1

SSH has two versions

4) Use a nonstandard port

This is the easiest one. There are literally millions of bots out there that spend quite a bit of bandwidth doing nothing but searching for SSH servers on port 22 and trying a very large number of username/password combos. Moving to a non-22 port significantly reduces the number of these attacks you'll undergo.

5) Use SSH keys for authentication

This actually allows you to disable password authentication entirely
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/Keys has lots of information on the hows and whys.

**TL;DR** Allied Electronics will take your money

We ordered through Allied Electronics

Fast-forward 3 months.  My girlfriend notices a mysterious $55.00 charge on her card.  Looking into it

A week later, no response to our inquiry about the charge or the fact that they haven't contacted us, nothing.

It's been two weeks.  There's no Pi.  There's no shipping notification.  There's still no response from Allied.  At this point

If there's one thing we've learned from this, it's become obvious that they're being erased (read: censored) from the RPi forums.

If you want a Pi

I mean

**EDIT**  Already getting downvoted.  Sorry for trying to warn other people who want to purchase a Pi

**EDIT 2** Wow!  Thanks for all the responses, driving the post down to zero.  I'm no karma whore, as you can tell from my 152 link karma (not that self-posts matter for that anways).  Just thought it strange that people would downvote a post to oblivion that's just trying to warn others of awful distributors.

I made a YouTube video in which i explain how it works and below you will find both the shell script and python script i used to setup the bridge and dump the packets respectively.

http://youtu.be/ZaHu0PratLU

The raspberry pi is placed in the middle and any data travelling between each device is captured by it. A second USB to Ethernet adapter is used to provide the second interface. The adapter i used is a USB to Fast Ethernet 10100 Mbps Network LAN Adapter Vista Linux 27723.

When the Raspberry pi starts it loads two scripts. The first is this shell script below:

    ifconfig eth0 0.0.0.0
    ifconfig eth1 0.0.0.0
    brctl addbr bridge0
    brctl addif bridge0 eth0
    brctl addif bridge0 eth1
    ifconfig bridge0 up



This script removed the IP address from eth0 and eth1. It then creates a bridge called bridge0. Adds the interfaces to bridge0 and starts the bridge.

The second script that starts after the one above is this python script.

    import subprocess
    #from dbupload import upload_file #Used for Dropbox uploading
    from datetime import datetime # Used the genreate the filename
    count = 0 #Counts the number of files that have been dumped
    while True:
        count = count + 1
        fileName = str(datetime.now().day) + ""-"" + str(datetime.now().month) + ""-"" + str(datetime.now().year) + "" AT "" + str(datetime.now().hour) + ""-"" + str(datetime.now().minute)
        tcpDumpProcess = subprocess.Popen([""tcpdump"", ""-w"", fileName, ""-i"", ""bridge0"", ""-G"", ""60"", ""1""]) #Sets up the TCPDump command
        tcpDumpProcess.communicate() #Runs the TCPDump command
        print ""Currently dumping file number "" + str(count) + "".""
        #upload_file(fileName, ""YOUR_EMAIL"",""YOUR_PASSWORD"") #Uploads the dump file to dropbox
        #print ""File uploaded Successfully""

This can obviously be done without using python and running the TCPDump command from command line. My intention was to integrate Dropbox uploading to the process but failed due to the inability to gain an internet connection from the raspberry pi when configured with a software bridge.

With both these files saves onto the raspberry pi and executed from the rc.local file at startup it will allow the raspberry pi to automatically capture network traffic between two devices.",self,t5_2syto,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/190nw3/my_raspberry_pi_packet_sniffer/

This is caused by the 8000 interrupts per second which are supposed to handle the USB events and data.

This issue isn't just something which doesn't matter or which can just be ignored. It's a serious issue as this hinders the use of RPi for many high performance and latency sensitive projects. For example

Simply suspending the USB yields a 20% performance increase.

Given the many problems many individuals have encountered with keys not being picked up and some folks reporting that they get better performance in Openelec with the network unplugged

It might be fixed by writing a custom interrupt handler in ASM.

1368268509.0,1e4ftg,My Raspberry Pi as a True Random Number Generator,Xtrato,94,15,66,"Hi everyone

I thought i would share with you my latest project involving the raspberry pi. I decided to make a random number generator using the static from an untuned TV.

Basically i setup the raspberry pi with a webcam and pointed it as the static on the TV. I used a python script to take a picture every couple of seconds. It then converted the picture it took into a black/white image.

This image was iterated through and a very long binary digit was created by reading if the current pixel is a black or white pixel and appending a 1 or 0 to a variable.

This variable was this converted to a decimal number and output to a file as a random number.

I created a [YouTube video](http://youtu.be/qTuNwIO1lBM) of the process and explained it a bit clearer in there. I also blogged about the process [here](http://jamesdotcom.com/?p=417) if interested.

Below is the source code:

    import Image
    import subprocess
    devNull = open('/dev/null'
    name = 0
    while True:
        name = name + 1

        captureImage.communicate()#executes the command detailed above with takes a picture using the webcam
        staticImage = Image.open(""static.jpg"")#Opens the image
        bW_Image = staticImage.convert('1')#Converts the image to a black or white image
        imageToProcess = bW_Image.load()#Saves the image to a variable that can be iterated through
        while pixelRow &lt; staticImage.size[0]:#Iterates through the image pixel by pixel

* Front and rear wide-angle 1080p@30fps (H.264) cameras with loop recording
* Design open source RPi carPC power supply that survives [load dumps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_dump), etc).
* Finish writes and unmount video/sensor data filesystem X seconds after external power loss (and even all USB connections lost).
* 3 axis accelerometer: +-12g @ 13bit
* 15 watts total power consumption recording 2 cameras to flash (no display or media hardware).


Many of you will quickly (and rightfully) bawk 'the RPi can't software-encode a single 1080p@30fps video stream in H.264 at real-time, it's a bandwidth and context switching issue (reading from USB, writing to SD). The *great* news is the RPi's main bus (~60MB/s) seems to be able to handle this load with ease on paper ([see linked google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0Aq-4kGISDbpvdDQ0WVRqVi03cWU2Um5CX1lhU1hreWc&amp;output=html)).


While spec'ing out this project


This project will be open source (likely GPL2) and **I welcome collaboration!**
[My project notes/spec spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0Aq-4kGISDbpvdDQ0WVRqVi03cWU2Um5CX1lhU1hreWc&amp;output=html) gives the best overview of the project and power supply planning currently ongoing. I'm very confident I can get the custom hardware built quickly once a design is finalized (I have 8 years of mixed-signal EE experience from concept to completed&amp;populated custom PCBs). I'm also confident I can get the software/embedded firmware done, I'll have a few extra boards I can populate with parts for serious developers at no cost.


Want to help but can't directly assist with lower-level development? Think about any features **you** would want in an RPi carPC power supply or RPi HD-video black-box. Need four analog lines for your car's &lt;whatever_widget&gt;? Now is the perfect time to consider all other options/features to suit the community at large.


Edit: I've just found a [rather disturbing thread](http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=28&amp;t=12097) about the USB controller and driver over at the main RPi forum. After reading the first few pages,False,self,t5_2syto,1348680671.0,,,t3_10ft1a

http://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/rfo7q/raspberry_pi_alternatives/c45rnm2



I need a linux device capable of running a webserver for php/mysql and do some testing with node.js/mongoDB.
I want to keep it running 24/7 so low power consumption is a must and that's why I'm not just using an old PC/laptop.

I really wanted to buy a Raspberry Pi but I set myself a deadline (End of March 2012) and now I'm looking for alternatives:

Alix Board (http://www.pcengines.ch)

Beagleboard (http://http://beagleboard.org/)

Netbook (or PC) with Intel Atom?! (I don't know about power consumption on those)

(The Sheevaplug seems to have stability/heat issues

On http://elinux.org/RaspberryPiPerformance we have some published benchmark numbers for common microbenchmarks. I underclocked an Atom N270 to about 630 MHz and did the very same benchmarks. I did not run the dhrystone/whetstone tests because I don't have the sources of the benchmarks used. [Here are the results.](http://pastebin.com/yJj8WX3M) Please compare yourself.

So there you have it: **the Raspberry Pi's CPU provides about one third of the integer and floating point throughput of a similarly clocked Intel Atom**. That's seven to eight times slower than a typical Intel Atom running at 1.6 GHz.

My PI is headless and it is a real pain to hunt down a monitor and keyboard just to retrieve the IP. I don't want to configure it with a static IP as I connect it to several different networks.

So this morning I wrote a simple python script that automagically emails me the IP address of the device. I then configured the OS to execute this script after.

It's very easy to use and will prove to be a real life saver.

Heres a [link to the script](https://gist.github.com/3913056)
 
 * Download the script
 * Edit the script to use a valid email account lines( 14-17 &amp; 20)
 * Execute a test run to verify that everything is working
 * If the test passes
 * Set permissions on the file: *chmod 711 /etc/init.d/email-ip*
 * Configure the script to execute on boot: *update-rc.d /etc/init.d/email-ip start 99 2 .*


*Notes*: This script will contain the login credentials for an email account. Anyone with root access to your machine will be able to retrieve these credentials. So I highly suggest you create a dummy account that is **only** used for sending these emails

Today I received a pair of new SD cards

Both as an exercise in writing a semi-scientific report, I decided to also compare a number of different SD cards I had lying around.

Since I wasn't able to find any recent benchmarks on the SD cards online
Excuse the extensive wall of text. I wanted to keep it short and simple, turning it more into a semi-scientific review.

###Materials used:

##SD HC cards
* Sandisk 8GB Extreme 30MB/s
* Sandisk 16GB Ultra 30MB/s
* Samsung 16 GB 40MB/s W - 80 MB/s R
* Samsung 32 GB 40MB/s W - 80 MB/s R

##PC:
* P8Z77-M PRO (USB 3.0 port used was one on the front)
* i5 3570K

##USB 3.0 reader: 
* Transcend TS-RDF8K (with latest TS21 firmware

##USB 2 reader: 
* Sitecom MD-018 V1 001

##Software used: 
* H2testw v1.4 (1000 MByte)
This software writes a 1GB piece of information in a single file to the drive


###Results:

Card|USB 3.0 Write speed [MB/s]|USB 3.0 Read speed [MB/s]|USB 2 Write speed [MB/s]|USB 2 Read speed [MB/s]
:--|--:|--:|--:|--:
Sandisk 8GB|26.4|41.1|17.3|20.4
Sandisk 16GB|32.5|41.1|17.8|20.4
Samsung 16GB|29.5|70.4|16.4|20.4
Samsung 32GB|28.6|70.3|16.3|20.4|


Even though both the sandisk cards are promoted with 30MB/s speeds (read or write not specified), any card will preform best in a sequential test.

The samsung cards didn't do that good in this regard. Both writing and reading speeds were lower than specified. 
Interesting to note though is that the 16 and 32 GB cards preform almost identically. My experience with Solid State Drives in PCs is that how bigger the drive gets

The USB 3.0 speeds are a lot higher than the USB 2 speeds. Because of the little variation between the measured speeds here
Curious to see is that the samsung cards are a bit slower than the sandisk cards

###Discussion:
As far as accuracy goes of these measurements
I've tried another type of software as well, because a single test takes much longer.
The results for the 8GB sandisk in H2testw were W 26MB/s, R 44MB/s.
meaning quite a large difference exists between different methods of measuring speed. You should only compare cards that were measured in the same way.

##Did my USB 2 reader reach it's speed limit?

yes

##Did the USB 3.0 controller reach it's maximum speed?

Of this I cannot be entirely sure.
When I compare the CrystalDiskMark (another piece of measuring software) scores for sequential reading and writing, using the same Transcend controller, but a faster SD card (http://www.legitreviews.com/article/2152/2/), I see that the values are higher for that card.
This could indicate that the card is faster
Since the card tested in the other review is faster than mine

##Was my USB 2 reader as fast as it could be?
Since I kept including more and more in this ""short"" benchmark, and 22 MB/s W speeds for my 32 GB card, compared to 20 MB/s R and 16 MB/s W on the other reader.

So no. It's actually a bit slow for a usb 2 reader.


###Conclusion:
Write speeds are about the same. The difference lies in the read speeds. For taking photographs, the almost double read speeds of the samsung cards might be just what you need.

And it's definately worth it to upgrade to a USB 3.0 reader

And don't buy a sitecom USB 2 reader

Hope you all find some use in my little benchmark ;)",self,t5_2syto,1375199004.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1jcqd7/some_sd_cards_compared/

At the moment it's not too bad, free and private internet. My ISP currently blocks several torrent websites, and sure there are mirrors, but I don't like this direction one bit.

There are various addons, so does not work for mobile devices.

My idea is for  a custom raspberry pi image that could be be booted without a screen. The service can be configured over a simple web interface but could work out the box. The raspberry pi would have a USB ethernet adapter (or wifi adapter acting as a host) and would act like a straight through internet connection. However it would use HTTPS wherever possible, and has the option to use a VPN or tor. 

The idea is someone with no electronics or software knowledge can plug this in before their router and have every device in their house as secure as possible

I have limited networking knowledge, so designing a custom usb ethernet adapter and a gpio status light board and a case isn't a problem. But I would need help with the software if this project is to take off.

Some of you may know me as the PiLFS guy
It's called [Raspberry Pi for Secret Agents](http://www.packtpub.com/raspberry-pi-for-secret-agents/book) and went on sale today in print and various eBook formats.
I wanted to write the book I wish I had when I first began exploring the world of computers.
It's all about having fun on the command line

Some of my favorite topics:

* Setting up video streams with MJPG-streamer
* Setting up Motion detection and alarms
* Scheduling audio/video recordings
* Mapping out your network with Nmap
* Pushing unexpected images into browser windows with Ettercap
* Tracking the Pi on Google Earth via GPS
* Sending periodic tweets from the Pi with GPS coordinates
* Creating an encrypted vault with cryptsetup
* Creating command shortcuts with aliases
* Keeping your recordings running safely with tmux
* Creating point-to-point wired and ad hoc Wi-Fi networks

Hope you guys like it!
Any reviews or feedback would be greatly appreciated.

However I realized something very specific I would like to do with it earlier this week and remembered that a store just two blocks from me sells them ready and waiting. 

**What I've Learned**

Don't be in a hurry. Setting up the Raspberry Pi takes time. I had links and resources ready before I bought it

Use scripts to automate install and compile. I have found these two to be the most useful after writing the [Raspbian “wheezy”](http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads) image to a SD card

[RetroPie-Setup](https://github.com/petrockblog/RetroPie-Setup)

[Pre-compiled XBMC for Raspbian](http://www.memetic.org/pre-compiled-xbmc-for-raspbian/)

Always back up your image! On PC, but should be used for also reading them back in to an image! Expanding the full SD card space takes time, compiling Mame takes for ever, even with scripts to set it up for you.

Don't over clock until you have a stable set up! I made the mistake of over clocking right away and I ended up having to start over twice. Hours of compiling

sudo raspi-config

Split your memory 256/256

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get upgrade -y

sudo apt-get install -y git dialog


These take a long time and are a per-requisite for installing Emulation station. Get this stable then back up your image. 

OpenELEC XBMC works really well but (as far as I can tell) won't let you compile as much on top of it as Raspbian. XBMC on Raspbian does feel slower but a good overclock helps tremendously. The over clock settings I have used also allow Genesis emulation to run full speed and the Desktop to operate smoother

arm_freq=1050

core_freq=500

sdram_freq=450

over_voltage=6

over_voltage_sdram=0

disable_overscan=1


XBMC has an option for sound over either HDMI or Analog



**What I still need to do!**

Emulation Station comes with

Setup my Controller properly in Emulation Station and create key binds for common functions so I won't need to have a keyboard set up. This would not only include exiting the emulation running and returning to the menu but also save states

Change the Default stating emulator when Emulation Station starts up. Also change the back ground pictures!

As I have Raspbian Desktop

Alternatively I may want to give Emulation Station priority boot but when I exit

Find a way to have the Screen in Emulation Station fit better.  The Genesis doesn't use the full screen from top to bottom and it's offset more towards the top. I don't want it stretched but a full 4:3. Also the Game Gear is rendered really Small. 

Eventually get a hardware button to boot up the system and also be able to send a command that will properly power down the Raspberry Pi.

I got the idea to use a monitor as a large photo frame and thought the Raspberry Pi would be perfect to run it.  The monitor has a built in 4 port usb hub.  The hub wasn't capable of providing proper power to the Pi

I took the monitor apart and found the perfect place for the pi to live.  I used a dremel to cut out some access ports for the power, and sd card.  I was able to run most of the cables inside the plastic enclosure, and only had to cut a few smaller holes to allow everything to plug in.

To stop the pi from shorting out against the metal frame

I have a edimax wireless usb dongle on one of the pi's onboard usb ports, find any photos on it, resize them to match the monitor's default resolution, and copies them to the slideshow directory. (the resizing cuts down on load times and saves space on the SD card)  Then, when the resizing is done for all the pictures, I get an email telling me it is done so I can take the usb drive out.

The pi runs raspbmc

It is currently still on the monitor stand

I think this is an excellent use for the Pi. I know a lot of people that host mumble servers for their friends but don't like doing so on their desktops due to the occasional restarts or what have you. Plus the Pi uses so little power. I don't know how many people it can hold before the quality suffers but Ive had 12 people on simultaneously all chatting away without any issue whatsoever with no overclock.

Next

csh -cf '/usr/bin/svscanboot &amp;'

Now you can either reboot your pi

From your main PC you'd like to connect to the pi from run this:

ssh pi@yourserver.org -p 2222

When the guys who dreamed up an open-source handheld console with decent specs first tried to get it made, preorders were announced.  The initial preorders were taken many months after they were initially scheduled, then had to be refunded a few weeks later due to Paypal being dicks.  The do-over preorders had to be sent by bank transfer, which is quite expensive in the US ($20-30 fee).  Those that paid in were told it would be a ""few months"" before the units were produced.

That was in 2008

Everything that could have gone wrong did - sometimes more than once.  Everything from part suppliers lying about stock to manufacturer screwups to licensing and regulatory issues.  Every time it looked like things were back on track, and while the specs may be a bit dated now, it's still a fun little device and I don't regret paying and waiting.

---

The point of all this isn't ""Quit yer whinin'

That's not to say that when a Toshiba or a Samsung makes a new device they don't have the same problems, asking if it's done yet.  All these setbacks and delays are *totally normal and expected* when developing a new product.  They just aren't expected by you because you've never developed a product before.  Perhaps they weren't expected by the RPi makers for the same reason - and that leads to promises that cannot be kept.  There's nothing malicious about it, it's just lack of experience.

So relax.  All things considered

If that's not acceptable to you, because we know it's not.  It's just the way these things go.

---

**TL;DR** - Relax. Delays are the name of the game.",self,t5_2syto,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/remqj/all_this_has_happened_before_and_all_this_will/

I want to be able to set it up as an automatic way to download new torrents along with being able to watch them on my TV. I got quite a bit of help a few days ago but I want to know the best way I can set it up to be able to download automatically to an external hard drive I have that will be connected directly to it and also when I download on my laptop will it matter if I plug in and unplug the hard drive from the RPI. If you cant tell I have zero experience and decided to dive face first into all this. Are there any programs that I can use that will sort the files? Hopefully at a minimum date or alphabetically, but more along the lines of music and movies and tv shows. I have no clue what I am doing but the best way to learn is to do right?

as a FreeBSD user.",7,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/vpwzv/adventures_with_a_raspberry_pi_and_archlinux_arm/,"Hello! I'm a FreeBSD user, and I'm not really used to most Linuxes. While I wait for FreeBSD to be ported (albeit probably without video acceleration due to the closed source drivers), I chose ArchLinux for my Raspberry Pi. I like how minimal it is (it doesn't even include a C compiler!), and I like their idea of the ""portage"" system (similar to FreeBSD's ports collection)~~ CRUX

Don't take anything here as sage advice, let me know! This is just sort of a journal of my first day with it, perhaps it will help some of you get set up with ArchLinux. I'm not aiming to type out a *complete* newbie guide here, so if you happen to find this and you have questions, just ask!

 * I used Win32DiskImager and the ArchLinux ISO available from the [Raspberry Pi downloads page](http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads). This was easy enough. The default username is ""root"" and the password is ""root"". You can use the `adduser` command to interactively add another new user.
 * I discovered once I booted that the remainder of my 32GB SD card was left as unpartitioned space. Apparently sometimes Win32DiskImager sorts this out automatically, and booted the CD.
 * Edit `/etc/rc.conf` to your liking. It's pretty self explanatory. I'll get back to a few of the things in there later.
 * To get sound to work over HDMI
 * There is a [beginner's guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Beginners'_Guide) to ArchLinux on their Wiki. You can start at the ""Post-Installation"" section, the following will upgrade the base system and all installed packages:

          # pacman -Syy    
          # pacman -Syu    
  
 * Packages are installed with `pacman -S &lt;packagename&gt;`. To search installable packages
 * Various things in `/opt/vc/bin`
 
          # echo ""/opt/vc/lib"" &gt; /etc/ld.so.conf.d/06rpi.conf &amp;&amp; ldconfig
   
 * By default, it makes sense to allocate more to the OS. In /boot, there are several ""arm_XXX_start.elf"" files. The ""start.elf"" file determines which one is actually used. More information is [available here](http://www.greenhughes.com/content/arch-linux-and-desktop-adventures-raspberry-pi). I used the one which allocates 224MB to the OS:
   
          # mv /boot/start.elf /boot/old_start.elf &amp;&amp; cp -p /boot/arm224_start.elf /boot/start.elf
   
 * You'll probably want to update your Raspberry Pi firmware. To do this
 
          # wget http://goo.gl/1BOfJ -O /usr/bin/rpi-update &amp;&amp; chmod +x /usr/bin/rpi-update    
          # pacman -S ca-certificates    
          # pacman -S git    
          # rpi-update    
 
 * If you're a Linux user, run `pacman -S sudo` as root. As a FreeBSD user, I'm a fan of the ""wheel"" group, which allows use of `su`. To get `sudo` to work for users in the `wheel` group, you need to edit the `/etc/sudoers` file. According to the ArchLinux documentation, you're apparently supposed to use  `visudo` to edit this file. I just used `nano` with no negative effects. Find the following line in the file and uncomment it:
  
          %wheel	ALL=(ALL) ALL
 
 * There are many things in `/boot/config.txt` that can be modified. This even includes overclocking, I had ""black bars"" on the top and bottom of the screen, in addition to not being able to select 1920x1080 resolution in X. More information on this file is [available here](http://elinux.org/RPi_config.txt). I'll give you my solution for my Samsung TV (over HDMI), but YMMV. To list the modes supported by your monitor, run `/opt/vc/bin/tvservice -m CEA` (this command will not work without the above fix for the related shared libraries). Oddly, sometimes these changes didn't survive a reboot, sometimes they did. Sometimes I'd be left with half a file after a reboot with the other half mysteriously missing. Make a backup first. Anyway, the solution was (find these values and change them):
 
          overscan_left=0    
	      overscan_right=0    
	      overscan_top=-20                   # Yes
	      overscan_bottom=-20    
	      framebuffer_width=1920    
	      framebuffer_height=1080    
	      hdmi_mode=16              # That's 1080p at 60hz
 
 * To install X: `pacman -S xf86-video-fbdev lxde xorg-xinit dbus`. This installs 'LXDE', even less than the Debian version. To get LXDE to start when you run `startx`, modify `~/.xinitrc` (it doesn't seem to want to run as root for me, so do this as your `wheel` user you created earlier):
 
          $ echo ""exec startlxde"" &gt; ~/.xinitrc
 * Firefox is not available for ArchLinuxARM
    
          # pacman -S midori  
 * To get nicer fonts in X
 * I wanted the Pi to be visible to my Windows machine for transferring of files, but be prepared for a lot of reading and changing things. According to `man hier`, `/srv/` seemed to be the most logical place to put media and such on this Linux distro, though I'm not sure if it's really the correct ""ArchLinux Way(tm)"". You'll want to follow all the directions on the above link, including making a guest account and using `smbpasswd` (which I read is deprecated for Samba &gt; 3.4, but it worked for me). Here's my configuration:
      
        [global]
          workgroup = YOURWORKGROUP
          server string = Raspberry Pi
          netbios name = raspi
          security = share
          load printers = no
          printing = bsd
          printcap name = /dev/null
        ;  disable spools = yes
          log file = /var/log/samba/%m.log
          max log size = 50
          dns proxy = no
          socket options = TCP_NODELAY IPTOS_LOWDELAY SO_KEEPALIVE SO_RCVBUF=131072 SO_SNDBUF=131072 SO_KEEPALIVE
        
        [media]
          path = /srv/
          read only = no
          public = yes
          writable = yes
          force user = root
 * To get Samba to run on boot-up (or any other daemon you install)
 
           DAEMONS=(!hwclock syslog-ng network openntpd @netfs @crond @sshd samba)
 * VLC is installable via pacman
 * Here's a [nice RasPi desktop background for LXDE](http://tomg.co/images/Raspi-background-tomg.co.png). Put it in `/usr/share/lxde/wallpapers`.
 * I got DOOM ][ to run. Install prboom (`pacman -S prboom`). The WAD file belongs in `/usr/share/games/doom/` (I used the DOOM2.WAD file from my Steam copy). Then just run `prboom` from an LXDE console (Raspberry Pi crashes if you attempt to do this from a non-X command line).

0. Only if you're using a Mac: Open up spotlight and search for the ""X11"" app. This opens up a shell where you can type the rest of the commands. You can do this straight from the terminal in linux.
1. ssh into your raspberry pi using the -X paramater: ssh -X pi@192.168.X.X
2. Enter the password for your user account.
3. Type: Xnest :1 &amp;
4. Press enter and type: lxsession -d :1


**What is going on here?**    

I hate VNC with a passion, who has the window focus, and how to minimize a window (among all the similar tasks it handles). The interesting thing about the window manager is that it's just an application like any other. The important part in this setup is the X session (known as Xorg, XFree, Xfree86, etc). This is what actually draws things to your screen. It takes the pixels and descriptions from the window manager, and displays them to your given monitor. The really cool part about X is that it's built around networking. What that means is that you can run an application on one linux machine

    
Do you have a netbook that runs firefox like a dog? You can run the firefox application on your beefy desktop and display the program on your netbook; all the work is done on the desktop. Normally you only do this with one program at a time

**Here's what's actually going on in those commands:**

If you're using a Mac, applications won't display on your client. Xnest requires some explanation, this is actually an application that works as an X server by itself. This application is running on the pi, and the window manager can run inside it without ever knowing there isn't actually a monitor attached. The ""colon 1"" part of the command is telling the application to open up a ""virtual display"" numbered 1; other applications can connect to this virtual display to show their interface. When you type in this command, you'll just get a blank screen because we haven't started the window manager. Finally, we'll start the window manager (LXDE by default, on the pi). The ""-d :1"" tells the window manager to attach to the virtual display 1 where Xnest is listening.

**tl;dr?**

So what all this jargon means is that you now have the full raspberry pi desktop running in a window on your PC. There's a bit of lag, if that's worth anything to you.

Here we are 3 more delays later, did they ONLY ship these things to people who would tweet about it? At this point, when I get one, nobody is going to hear a word out of me, I'm so pissed off. Anyways..  
I decided to check on my orders this afternoon. I called Allied because it wouldn't let me log in. Dialed the toll free number on their website, that it was a web order and there was nothing he could do for me, he was just a regional sales office. WTF? Finally figured out that I had to MAKE an account on their site before I could run my order number and check the status of the order. At which point the site told me my order didn't exist?!?! I found a local sales rep for Allied and forwarded my order confirmation number to him, he, again, said he could do nothing for me, and gave me a link to a page to register interest. I don't want to register interest! I am a paying customer

The Sega emu just completely crases my Pi when I try to play (I'm testing it using the game ""Flicky"" if it makes a difference) and I have to power cycle the Pi.

The MAME emu trys to play the games but it goes back to the selection screen. When I check the terminal it says something like ""game no supported"". I have tested MAME with Mortal Kombat 4 and Metal Slug 3 and 5.

The PS1 emu does the same as the SEGA one

I'm building my own Linux kernel and OS using Linux From Scratch, and running all of this from a battery pack while keeping the option to use an adapter. Making everything work isn't an issue so bring on the tough workarounds. 

My problem now is finding the best peripherals to use in order to get the most performance I can in the smallest package. I'm hoping to keep the profile under 3""

I need the following:

- Smallest possible 5v battery pack (stepped up 3.7 or a higher voltage stepped down would also be fine)
- The best option for wiring the buttons with possible analog hookup for joysticks. I'll probably stick to a breadboard for prototyping
- A service where I can provide references for the case I want to use and have someone make it for me either by machining or 3d printing (won't need this for quite some time though)

My one stipulation is that I want to do as much of the work on my own as possible. I just want to be pointed to the right place to start looking.
