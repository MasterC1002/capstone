1375801417.0,1jtbyt,Quick and Dirty Washington Post Valuation,currygoat,27,1,3,"Some people may wonder why so many M&amp;A transactions are posted in this sub. M&amp;A transactions often have interesting wrinkles that expose undervalued securities. I particularly focus on divestitures as they can materially change the balance sheet and earnings/cash flow profile of a company. Many times I'll do a quick and dirty valuation to see if anything obvious jumps out at me. Some interesting things were there and at first there was nothing to see. Now I'll put this on my watch list until I get more information.

As posted yesterday, and the [letter agreement](http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/104889/000095015713000294/ex2-1.htm)):

Operating Assets:

* Education Business - Consists of Kaplan's Higher Ed (For Profit Education)

* Cable Television - Owns Cable ONE business that has ~600k subs in 19 midwestern states (2012: ~$285M EBITDA)

* Television Broadcasting - Owns Post-Newsweek Stations that has 6 TV stations in Houston, Orlando, San Antonio, and Jacksonville. (2012: ~$200M EBITDA, 2011:~$130M EBITDA)

* Remaining Publishing Businesses - Slate, Foreign Policy

* Other Businesses - WaPo Labs

Non Operating Assets/Liabilities:

* Cash, Real Estate, **Net Pension Assets**, Debt

Quick and Dirty Valuation:

I'm going to use comps for this valuation as it is quick and dirty. There have been numerous issues across for-profit education: drops in enrollment, and the sector is in general turmoil. Companies trade at 2X-5X EBITDA based on how quickly earnings are falling. APOL's revenue and EBIT is falling faster than DV's so APOL trades around 2X EBITDA and DV trades around 5X EBITDA. Kaplan's revenue and EBITDA are falling relatively slowly so I'll give it a 4X multiple.

WPO's other businesses are in areas where there have been recent M&amp;A activity.  Charter recently acquired [Cablevision's Systems Bresan Broadband Holdings for 1.625B (8X-9X EBITDA)](http://www.deadline.com/2013/02/charter-buys-cablevision-western-systems/). Also

I'll value the cash as cash (restricted cash isn't counted) and debt as debt. Marketable securities will be adjusted as they hold 2

The company holds a 16.5% interest in Classified Ventures and they own Cars.com and Apartments.com.  These companies are web 1.0 darlings are in danger of being disrupted by other products. Rent.com was bought by eBay in 2004 for $415M and sold to Primedia last year for an undisclosed price. These assets are worth something

Their remaining publishing businesses could be worth $75M. You can use the HuffPo sale to AOL as a comp for Slate. At that point in time

Real Estate not included in the sale of the Washington Post includes, 1523 L St NW, 1100 15th St NW, and wharves and warehouses on the Alexandria, VA waterfront owned by Robinson Terminal Warehouse. [You can look up the DC Properties here](https://www.taxpayerservicecenter.com/RP_Search.jsp?search_type=Assessment) and [the Alexandria Property here](http://realestate.alexandriava.gov/index.php?action=address) to get their tax assessed values. This should give you a lower bound on what the properties are worth. The DC Properties are assessed at about $80M in total and the Alexandria property is assessed at $16.3M.

The pension is the most interesting piece to me. I'm assuming that this is not sold to Bezos for two reasons that may or may not be justified:

1. When they sold Newsweek in 2010

2. The pension is over funded and they have a $560M asset on their balance sheet.

&gt;The Company assumed a 6.5% expected return on plan assets for fiscal year 2012, respectively.

WPO's pension managers have beaten the market over the past 1-year, 10-year, and  20-year periods (I'm sure with a large dash of Warren Buffett). This is something that is very rarely seen and their overfunded pension is the result.

* Education Business - $125M x 4X = $500M
* Cable Television - $285M x 8.5X = $2423M
* Television Broadcasting - $165M x 7.5X = $1238M
* Remaining Publishing Businesses - $75M
* Other Businesses - $0
* Washington Post Consideration - $250M
* Cash - $300M
* Marketable Securities - $470M + 37M = $507M
* Investments in Affiliates - $33M
* Real Estate - $96M
* Pension Assets - +$589M
* Debt - -$533M

Total Value = ~$5.5B

Current Market Cap = $4.42B

I revised this as I had forgotten some assets that moved the value up 10%. There's alot of uncertainty around how much the remaining publishing businesses make

Your contribution to the discussion should really be simple. You should be able to articulate why this is a buy/sell/or hold. It's best to have supporting evidence for how you make your argument. You should have primary data on your side. This can come from a variety of sources. Market share data which shows the company is sliding. Financial ratios which show it's deteriorating. Industry data which shows the supply/demand situation is skewed towards one side or another. Not really looking for full blown write ups here

Notes to book “Security Analysis” 6th edition
Written by: Benjamin Graham and David Dodd


I thought these quotes from Security Analysis Sixth Edition Hardcover might be food for thought.  

Benjamin Graham and David Dodd first wrote security Analysis in 1934.  The first edition was described by Graham as a “book that is intended for all those who have a serious interest in securities values.”  The book was not designed for the investment novice.  One must have an intermediate to advanced understanding of financial statements

”Losing money, we should relish the opportunity to buy significantly more “on sale.”  But if our net worth has tumbled along with the share price, it may be psychologically difficult to add to the position.”

On Page [xviii] Klarman wrote: 

”Skepticism and judgment are always required.”

“Because the value of a business depends on numerous variables

“In the end, intellectual honesty, and years of analytical and investment experience.”
 
On Page [xx] Klarman wrote: 

”Even in the worst of markets, which must simply be endured.  They expressed confidence, in those dark days, the economy and stock market would eventually rebound: “While we were writing, we had to combat a widespread conviction that financial debacle was to be the permanent order.”

On Page 57 Roger Lownestein wrote: 

”As a rule of thumb, both the balance sheet and the statement of cash flow will throw significant light on the number that Wall Street pays the most attention to, the reported earnings.”

On Page 138 Howard S. Marks wrote: 

”Importantly, in its infancy in the mid – 1970’s, the leveraged buyout industry restricted its purchases to noncyclical companies.  Of course, like all important investment principles, this one is often ignored in bullish periods; enthusiasm and optimism gain sway and the stable –cash-flow rule can be easily forgotten.”

On Page 140 Marks reminded us of a Graham quote from page 185 of 2nd ed.: 

“During the great and disastrous development of the real estate mortgage-bond business between 1923 and 1929
The appraised value of the property, to which the appraisers were willing to attach their names for a fee, and whose only function was to deceive
the investor as to the protection which he was receiving.”

“This whole scheme of real estate financing was honeycombed with the most glaring weaknesses, and ordinary common sense on the part of all parties concerned that it was permitted to reach such gigantic proportions before the inevitable collapse.”


Here is a Graham quote from page 43 of 2nd ed.:

“Now let us consider a similar judgment based primarily upon the trend. In 1929 nearly all public-utility systems showed a continued growth of earnings
that the small margin of safety was no drawback



Ezra Merkin (an alleged Madoff feeder) on page 288 wrote in an essay titled ""Blood and Judgment.""

""Still if Graham and Dodd's bible cannot be understood today without commentary, fear, pressure, doubt and the entire range of human emotions, there will be money to be made by those who steel themselves to overcome emotion. As long as the human tendency to march in herds persists, there will be opportunity for contrarians who are unafraid to stand alone.""

Glenn H. Greenberg wrote on page 399 and 400

""Accounting has always presented management with opportunities to misrepresent results.  In 1934

 ""The second challenge to rational investing is to maintain one's logical convictions in the face of excess gloom or euphoria as reflected in stock prices. I doubt many owners of private companies are preoccupied with the value of their business on a short-term basis - how different from the public markets

""Obviously it requires strength of character in order to think and act in opposite fashion from the crowd and also patience to wait for opportunities that may be spaced years apart.""

On Page 405 Greenberg discussed the 3 main challenges of Value Investing: 

A.	“Careful research takes time and seldom results in a clear case of taking a large position.  It is tedious to always review and seldom uncover an opportunity.”

B.	“It is difficult to maintain ones logical convictions in the face of excess gloom or euphoria as reflected in stock prices.”  He discusses something we occasionally ponder.  The concern that our analysis is incorrect as a company’s stock price gets pounded.  Greenberg writes

C.	He discusses the presence of greed and how that is now exaggerated in 2008 by the proliferation of hedge funds.

On page 687 Graham discussed the apparent nationalization of

At the close of 1938 a total of 111 railway companies operating 78, had it not been that the earnings of the railroads as a whole continued for some years to make disappointing showings as compared with general business.”

On Page 708 Graham wrote: 

”Purchase of securities selling well below intrinsic value.  Intrinsic Value takes into account not only past earnings and liquid asset values but also future earning power, there must be many cases in which the market goes clearly and crassly astray, thus creating real opportunities for the discriminating student.”

DVA is a pretty good company--profitable, but not too exciting. Then I read their final prospectus on their merger with HealthCare Partners. And everything made sense.

HealthCare Partners is a private medical services company, using $4.7B long term debt, $1B in new stock issue. 

As a combined company, they are not going to report $800~~B~~M in combined earnings this year, because there is a special payout to HCP in form of $315M cash, reducing their earnings to ~$500M. So in 2012, their net earnings will go up only about 15%. Next year, they should fully realize their combined earnings.

So why didn't HCP just go IPO instead? They would be worth maybe $10B

So there you go. Double the earnings with little share dilution,False,,t5_2s7v0,1349907288.0,,,t3_119gw2

I just simply looked at the numbers and compared TSLA (Tesla) with F (Ford).

According to today's stock price of $97.08 for TSLA

* TSLA market capitalization = $17.82B
* F market capitalization      = $66.46B    

This means that Ford is only worth 3.73 times as much as Tesla. I find that very had to believe. Especially when you dig a bit deeper and come by the stockholder equity numbers. 

* TSLA stockholder equity = $168.58M 
* F stock holder quity       = $19.22B 

Not to mention that Q2 earnings also show 

* TSLA net income = -11.25M
* F net income      = + 1.23B 

So I was wondering why when Ford has 30 times the stockholder equity of Tesla and when Ford has many times more the profits of Tesla,,False,,t5_2s7v0,False,,True

But am I the only one who's kinda sick of the value investing culture? It's like the same things -the same concepts- explained over and over and over again. I saw someone commented on the Doug Barnett video: ""There's nothing new to learn here."" Yeah

If you've read one or two value investing books

While I'm ranting away I might as well mention what I see as a big drawback of most VI books: a lack of examples and detailed analysis of the examples. This is where Greenblatt's book excels but few others do. In my opinion

Am I the only one that feels this way? At some point an investor needs to shift his focus from value investing to business in general. I wish I had shifted mine earlier- I'd be a better investor now if I had. I also think that most people should make the shift way earlier than they do. That being said

41 people have registered for this competition, OCLR, PRXI, and BREW. While I am no longer almost in last, I'm still below average.  I have not sold any of my positions since the last update and only initiated one Merger Arb position.  SVU is currently down 14% and is still the biggest dog in my portfolio. I pursued a very concentrated strategy for the simulation and I'm interested in seeing how this turns out.

Only 4 of 23 people that made trades (itsmedog, and egoodwin) are currently beating the S&amp;P500's return YTD of 9.26%. I expect this trend to continue as most active managers don't beat broad based indexes.

Except this company's stock price crashed around may.

So what happened? The senior executives of NexGen, and tried a proxy fight. In fact, he's tried several proxy fights over the years. Then he sold half of his stake in his company, which was more than 10% of the outstanding stock. He claims his broker did this without his knowledge. His opponents on the board says he had his shares in a margin account which forced a sale when the stock price declined. Whatever the reason, when someone holding 20% of the company sells half, stock prices usually go down.

Why I think QSII has potential:
Despite the board muckety muck, because it's hard for hospitals to switch to a competitor's system. 

I think eventually QSII's stock price will recover. They are still growing, because of their low price (their competitors are trading like 30x earnings), and because of the existing customer base.

1359326333.0,17e43v,Let's shatter some widely held notions in investing as it is normally taught.,pro_skub,21,7,23,"This is a bit of a philosophical post as I would like it to be based mainly on pure reflection and logical inference rather than statistics and data. Of course relying on statistics will improve your decisions, we can greatly improve our results and ignore a good deal of pervasive nonsense. 

What I'd like to do here is to do away with commonly held notions that, are taught in business schools and widely spread in investing newspapers, blogs, analysis, etc.

--------

I think a very powerful idea in investing is the use of heuristics:

By using certain heuristics you can completely wipe out entire categories of errors. As an example

To start with

If I were to model the price of a stock I think I couldn't even use a statistical variable following a probability distribution

The way I value a stock is not by a specific number (although this is how it is trade in the stock market)

As an example, it won't need large amounts of capital expenditure, it can expand to such and such countries, it has this kind of economics, etc... and it sells at 10 times earnings. Using a historical 15 times earnings in the US as a yardstick (admitedly belonging to a a bygone era of higher returns) this is probably a great investment. Thus we can decide to allocate a big portion of our portfolio on it. The key thing is to realise that this kind of situation not only happens frequently enough to guarantee a good investment record on the long run, but that you probably **can't** be any more accurate than this.

As well as ""target price"" another notion of very little usefulness is calculating the **DCF** value. 

Thus a very powerful heuristic in investing would be to altogether **avoid** attempting to calculate DFC valuation for a more robust track record over time.

Simple enough

1350415453.0,11l2xi,Here's my value based idea. Aircastle Ltd (AYR),MyBoyDoxey,14,1,6,"Aircastle acquires

Aircastle, it trades at 0.7x book value and 7.5x earnings. 

Based on the stated financial statements, management has shown they are willing to opportunistically divest these jets in order to create value (the gain on sale of these assets proves that replacement value is greater than book value). To remain extremely conservative (as promised), I assume they could divest their fleet at a 10% discount and still, tangible book value per share comes to $13.40. This gives a margin of safety of 15%. 

Earnings power for Aircastle is strong (and resilient) – liquidation value of the portfolio only provides a price floor. 

The market has (unfairly) beaten up aircraft leasing companies post-financial crisis, Aircastle has shown resilience during the economic down-turn. Since 2006,Aircastle has grown operating cash flow from $135m to $359m. Although one might argue that this is because management has expanded the balance sheet over this period (through debt financing), I will add that management has maintained an ROE of ~9% and grown ROIC from 5% to 9%. 

Earnings, including ~$200m of D&amp;A expenses. Adjusting these earnings for D&amp;A and subtracting a conservative maintenance capex of $100m (double the average maintenance capex as % of PPE since 2006) gives us levered free cash flow of $200m. This gives us an equity value per share of $17 – 27 per share, assuming a cost of equity of 10 – 16%. 

Earnings power of this company gives us a margin of safety of 50 – 140%

These earnings have not been impaired and are unlikely to be in the future. Barriers to entry include several billion dollars of financing and a relationship with an aircraft manufacturer in order to assemble a fleet of jets. Although there is tough competition in this industry

Catalyst: Aircastle can continue to grow its dividend which is yielding 5%. In the next 3 to 5 years, management could liquidate the portfolio and payout investors.",,False,,t5_2s7v0,False,,

I'll explain GEICO. It is often said that GEICO is a low cost provider, about 20% of our insurance costs are used to pay for agent compensation. GEICO eliminated this 20% and passes the savings onto the consumer.

**Why is this durable?** Because most other personal lines insurers were built around proprietary distribution, their exclusive agents will be angered and before the direct business can be launched, their agents will complain and threaten to stop bringing in premium. Because of this very reason, any change for the incumbents was very limited, and gives GEICO not only a competitive advantage, but a *durable* one that has last since 1937 and still allows them to pump out combined ratios as low as 88 just a few years ago on a simple product - standard auto.

I believe one of the greatest problems the current generation will face is the rising demand for energy for the world's population. Not only is the world population growing exponentially

I also believe, long lasting sources should provide outsized gains over the next 10-20 years.*

Alternative energy will be the way this energy demand is fulfilled in the long term. The catch is, the current state of solar is bleak, and *the big winner will be the company that can deliver costs low enough to not require government subsidy, while improving efficiency such that the costs can compete with fossil fuel energy sources*. This will become easier over time as energy becomes more expensive for everyone.

The way I am proposing to play this climate:

Oil stocks are still cheap in a P/E sense. The winner in my mind will be the company with the most stable backlog of oil sources to drill

Solar stocks are all going at low valuations. The catch is

This is not a solicitation of any sort.  This is not a recommendation to buy

March 19

National Western Life Insurance Company is a life insurance and annuity company. They sell their products both domestically and internationally. Most of their annuities are sold domestically, 23% in 2011 ( I previously reported this as 32%) and 19% in 2010. National Western Life Insurance Company has been around since 1956. Their investment portfolio is reported to be of primarily investment quality bonds and matched to their insurance and annuity policies future commitments. Robert Moody owns 34% of Class A, and nearly 100% of Class B. 

Price to Book Value as of March 19, as it has since 1956. AM Best has reaffirmed NWLI’s ‘A’ rating on May 26, 2011. I like the apparent conservatism of the company, and that is the primarily reason for our owning National Western Life.

I think book value is the most important metric in valuing NWLI. Book Value at December 31, 2011. If NWLI was to trade at 70% of book value reported as of March 19, 2013, the price would be ~$268 per share. Book value has grown consistently since 1991. Book Value has grown in a fairly consistent manner, at an annualized rate of 9.61% since 1991. My preference is a strong balance sheet, even if the sacrifice is some ROIC.

I think NWLI should trade at at least 55% of book value (probably closer to 65% or 70 %+). You can impute a growth rate of book value of say 5%. Currently book is $382.88. If one was to adjust to 55% of reported book value

I do not see great portfolio risk for the long term holder of NWLI. Yet

Robert Moody (77) owns 34% of the company. As stated in the 2011 DEF 14A he is “Chairman of the Board &amp; Chief Executive Officer from 1963-1968, Chief Executive Officer, and Director of Moody National Bank (banking services); and Trustee of The Moody Foundation (charitable and educational foundation) since 1955. Mr. Moody’s tenure as Chief Executive Officer affords him extensive insight into the Company’s operations and qualifies him to serve as Chairman of our Board of Directors.”

Ross Moody (50) is the son of Robert Moody. He has been President and COO since 1992.

Management has depth in the industry and longevity with the company. I think the long term growth of the company both operationally; balance sheet, strength of balance sheet, and perhaps not caring of the stock price. I am cool with that. I am patient, and don't mind waiting.

I think Moody, will continue to make sure the balance sheet remains strong. To me this is evident via AM Bests rating of the company, as well as an upgrade right after the credit crisis, during a time when most companies were being downgraded for risk. 

There is a small amount of Level 3 assets on their balance sheet. Hence

Total Investments on December 31,169. $5,962,120 of their total investments of $9,101,169 is reported at amortized cost. Likewise, $2,001 of their total investments is reported at fair value. If amortized assets were reported at fair value, the current market capitalization of the company is ~$680M. Hence

I have discussed our goal with management considering a stock buy back of some type. Management commented on this in the 2011 10-K and in their annual report. The following were our thoughts on management discussing in the 2011 Annual Report

“In regards to stock buy-back, it seems as though NWLI has no reason not to announce a buyback, or tender shares, or allocate some type of resources to this cause. It almost seems ignoring it by the company is a lack of fiduciary responsibility to minority shareholders. Of course this is based on the premise that operationally and financially there are no issues or skeletons in the closet at National Western Life. I understand the history and the goal of the continuity of a fortress balance sheet, as well as continued positive ratings by AM Best and Standard and Poor’s. I can’t imagine that an announcement as to buy back shares continually for say less than 50 cents on the dollar would negatively affect the company’s ratings. I think if the company announced the purchase, offer or intent for say 300,000 shares, and at worst

""The Company relies on stockholders' equity for its capital resources as there is no long-term debt outstanding and the Company does not anticipate the need for any long-term debt in the near future. As of December 31, there are no imminent plans for the Company to repurchase its shares as the Board of Directors has adopted a strategic policy of building a strong capital base to maintain high financial strength ratings and the ability to take competitive advantages as they arise. The capacity to pay dividends is limited by law in the state of Colorado to earned profits (statutory unassigned surplus). At December 31, 2011 , the maximum amount legally available for distribution without further regulatory approval is $91.9 million."" NWLI 2011, Form 10-K

Risks:
 1.
Deferred Acquisition Costs (DAC) - are $858M

 2.
Fraud - I think this is a standard risk with any financial company. There are related party situations such as Moody National Bank and American National Insurance

 3.
Brazil - “On October 26, property, or assets in Brazil. The Company and its legal advisors believe that SUSEP has no jurisdiction over the Company, that SUSEP's attempts at service of process have been invalid, and that any penal fine would be unenforceable. For the reasons described above, the Company does not believe that this matter meets the definition of a material pending legal proceeding as such term is defined in Item 103 of Regulation S-K but has included the foregoing description solely due to the purported amount of the fine sought.

 
Although there can be no assurances, pending, or threatened legal actions will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or operating results of the Company.

Catalysts:
 1.
An activist investor in theory could start rattling the cage of the company. 

2.
An alleged goal of Robert Moody is that he would like NWLI to be as large as American National Insurance (Moody is Chairman and CEO). American National Insurance has Stockholder’s Equity of $3.7B as of December 31

 3.
Greater understanding of the company by the investment community

Using [Professor Damodaran's definitions](http://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2012/06/value-investing-identity-crisis.html)

a. [Passive value investor](http://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2012/06/passive-value-investing-screening-for.html): The oldest strand of value investing traces its lineage back to Ben Graham and his use of screens to find cheap stocks. Reviewing those screens, you are looking at stocks that trade at low multiples of earnings, pay a high proportion of these earnings as dividends and have a high proportion of assets that can be liquidated for close to their book value. In the years since, investors have added other screens (good management, stable earnings, strong competitive advantages etc.) that are all designed to reduce the potential for downside on the investment.

b. [Contrarian value investor](http://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2012/06/contrarian-investing-going-against-flow.html): In contrarian value investing, on the assumption that markets generally over react and that the portfolio of these losers will bounce back over time. In its more refined forms, you add other criteria to the mix. Thus, you may buy stocks that have gone down but only if they have a strong brand name and/or little debt.

TCC is a technology company that operates in the highly competitive market for communications security devices. Government contracts make up the majority of their revenue and with the Afghan war drawing down and defense spending cuts possibly around the corner, and their highly unpredictable earnings, the stock has been severely beaten down.

The company currently has $4.83/sh in cash and marketable securities on their balance sheet with no debt. They also have $1.50/sh in inventory. When a 25% discount is assumed for writedowns

Inventory (75%): $1.13

This is assuming future earnings are worth nothing and future losses won’t burn through cash. Over the past two years, and sales. If the company can capture just a small piece of the growing market for communications security in both the corporate and government worlds, then the value of their future earnings will spike dramatically. Over the last 8 years, if their best year is removed, the company has averaged an eps of $0.47. If a 20% discount rate is applied, the value of this earning stream continuing is roughly $2.35.

Cash/Securities: $4.83
Discounted Earnings: $2.35
Target Price: $7.18

The annual interest received on the collateral was equal to about $87 on each 7% note (which amount was actually being distributed to the note holders), so that the current income on the 7s was considerably greater than that on the 5s. Whatever technicalities might be invoked to prevent the note holders from asserting their contractual rights promptly and completely, it was difficult to imagine conditions under which the 7s would not be intrinsically worth considerably
more than the 5s.


In short I don't understand the passage.


What does this mean:

* ""Each $1, the noteholders would receive the 5s face value immediately??)

* ""the principal of the notes had matured; they were entitled either to be paid off in full or to a sale of the collateral for their benefit"" (ok so the note holders have a choice: either get the $1000 that they put down initially

* if the collateral were sold,736??

* what does ""5 s"" mean?

Am I understanding this correctly? thx for your help.

""In an empirical study of Graham-styled defensive investor portfolios, the aggregate results of his study indicated that in the 20 year period, significant excess returns were available to the Graham investor.

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/WHzCE.png) is the historical EPS/PE/Dividends information for the last ~16 years with estimates for the next few years from Value Line. From '03 to '09 their PE was on average 20 and right now it's closer to 10.5.

So I decided to do some due diligence and check out what it's up to. It's a medical company, my alarms went off. It sounds pretty bad, but I write it off as marketing BS, and start to look up some published papers on the active ingredients. It seems their medical applications are not well researched, but I did find a few independent studies claiming health benefits (in pigs). Also found non-medical papers investigating chemical properties. I can imagine someone heavily dosed with psychedelics could translate these properties into a blurb about the natural intelligence of molecules.

So, but I did not find enough research on health effects to regard it as confirmed. Also, the papers I read did not cover side effects. Unlike some forums i found, where consumers complained about them. They also complained about water fluoridation, chemtrails and vaccinations, so there's that.

Conclusion:
Company sells some dubious products. Main target demographic are the crazy people around the world. I personally would advise anyone to stay away from the products until further research. But as there is a healthy supply of people who are suspicious of the drinking water but would take double doses of some pills with magical molecules, just worse, as I believe tobacco consumers are aware of the effects of smoking, and they choose to indulge in their habit. I would have no qualms about investing in a tobacco company.

My dilemma is: I wish noone would buy anything from this company. I also understand that there are people aching for products like these. Would you consider buying in such a situation?

I'm referring to ***ALL*** large cap stocks and most mid cap stocks.

By focusing your attention on micro caps and small caps, insider information, millions to play with, etc and that are avoiding small caps purposely because they have a much bigger fish to fry than compete for a stock that's too small to be worth their time.

Here's is my theoretical reasoning behind my valuation model:
1. Remove ""poor-quality"" cash flows from Cash from operations. This includes things like:  
-increases in AP  
-decreases in AR  
-deferred taxes/tax benefits  
-asset sales not in the regular course of business  
-stock based comp  
-decrease in ADA (allowance for doubtful accts)
-unexplained cash generated from changes in long-term assets
  
Once these ""high-quality"" Cash from operations are selected
  
Additionally, and adding any off-balance sheet items. Finally, segregate the equity portion of this adjusted B/S and find the per-share value of equity.
  
Then take the Present value of cash flows per share and add it to the adjusted equity value per share to come up with a Price per share.  
  
Does this sound reasonable? Please shoot as many holes in my methodology as possible!

So Air Lease Corporation is a company that buys commercial aircraft and then leases them to companies around the globe. They went IPO in 2010 and have had positive and quickly growing earnings in 2011 and 2012. Additionally

Right now they are currently priced at about 20 P/E. Their EPS growth rate has been very good with their most recent quarter growing at 46% YoY. The top line has grown fairly quickly as well and they have been able to maintain their margins while at it. I think a P/E of 20 is undervalued at the rate they are growing and would be comfortable paying that multiple for only about a 20% YoY growth.

I've read their most recent 10-K and it appears their management is doing a good job balancing expansion while not getting overleveraged.

I've been delving deeper into value investing and after reading Margin of Safety by Seth Klarman

**Liquidation Analysis**

* For this valuation
* Does anyone else use a different variation?

**NPV**

* I use a series of cash flows and a discount rate. However
* I currently use FCFE or FCFF depending on the company and then I use a growth rate specific to whether its FCFF or FCFE for each subsequent cash flow period. I found this all on [Damodaran's pages](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/). The discount rate I simply put multiple percentages from 10-15%.
* Are there other ways to arrive at cash flows? Should I be using WACC for the discount rate? What do you do?

**DCF**

* I have seen so many ways of arriving at a DCF valuation that I haven't even began trying to use DCF analysis yet. 2-stage, FCFF, etc. I'm not entirely sure how this is different from NPV so maybe someone can clear that up for me.
* I suppose the DCF analysis could help me arrive at a somewhat reliable present value?
* I have a hard time finding the cost of debt and market value of debt for the WACC so I'm twiddling my thumbs in uncertainty.


If anyone has experience with this type of thing, I'll share it with others.

Cheers!

Page 1.

“The objectives of security analysis are twofold.  First, based upon the facts and applicable standards, as to the safety and attractiveness of a given security at the current or assumed price.”

Graham goes on to explain that the analyst must understand security forms, the general workings of the economy and securities markets. 

“He must be able to dig for facts

Graham presents 4 charts on pages 4 – 7.

A.	Stocks Versus Bonds for Maintaining Real Income.
B.	Financial Data (including Income
C.	Physical Data
D.	Price and Wage Data


On Page 13 Graham reminds us that the serious obstacle is that analysis is not an exact science.  He also mentioned

On page 17 he writes

On page 21 he writes

On page 23 he writes


On page 27 he writes

On page 28 he writes one of his more famous quotes, on which the value of each issue is recorded by an exact and impersonal mechanism, in accordance with its specific qualities.  Rather should we say that the market is a voting machine, whereon countless individuals register choices which are the product partly of reason and partly of emotion.”

“Beware of “bargains” when most stocks seem very high.”


On page 59 he writes, we think, the real implication of dollar averaging is that they should be wary of putting more money in stocks at higher prices than they did at lower prices – which is a common failing – and that they should never let a lower price level scare them away from buying.”


On page 65 he writes

 
On pages 70 and 71 he writes
which the good management has produced

“Now let us consider a similar judgment based primarily upon the trend. In 1929 nearly all public-utility systems showed a continued growth of earnings
that the small margin of safety was no drawback

Page 307 has an interesting sentence.  “It would appear to be sound theory to require regularly some protective provisions on the score of working capital in the case of industrial bonds.  We suggest that a ratio of 100% in net current assets to funded debt be considered as one of the specific criteria in the selection of fixed-income industrial bonds.”

On page 322

On page 334, and felt that market value was a proper tool for determining safety of bonds.  He used an example of requiring enterprise value to be at least twice the amount of the debt.  He discusses how market prices are always fluctuating, and that one should allow considerable leeway for the vagaries of Wall Street.

	He goes onto discuss that operating rentals should be capitalized at an appropriate rate.  From that rate one can estimate a fair value for debt.  This has always been a confusing task for me

Page 388, together with a sad record of financial exploitation and malpractice.”

Page 408

Page 459, and then make an intensive study of the available materials to find confirmation of his views.  The figures will generally prove quite encouraging – since he was attracted to the industry in the first place by some optimistic indications.”

“So, in Lord Bacon’s phrase, the “idols of the market place.”  The payment of an exceedingly liberal price for expected future improvement – in the form of a very high multiplier of past earnings – is hardly a businesslike procedure.”  Graham goes onto discuss how this type of investment has “served at times to turn some of our best and strongest common stocks into speculative and risky vehicles.”

Page 476, and investment funds, but only slightly, if at all, to finance or credit companies.”

Chapter 39

I have indicated this as a reference tool for the future.

Page 493, circumstances change and that we must adjust our analysis.
On page 502 he writes
 
Page 504, the earnings figure for the analyst to keep in mind is what we would describe as the estimated earnings potential.  This expression is one we use to indicate the maximum per-share earnings reasonably expectable under the regulatory policies of the state in which the company operates.  It represents the earnings resulting from a “full,” or over-all return, after deducting the annual service requirements on all senior securities outstanding.”

Chapter 40 discusses an appropriate capitalization rate for expectable earnings.  This is called the “Earnings-Capitalization Rate.”

He indicates that this rate fluctuates widely over time.  Also mentions that electric utility companies have a tendency to have somewhat predictable historical averages.  You can see a table that Graham devised here.

Factors Affecting the Capitalization Rate

1.	Prospective Growth of the enterprise.
2.	Known or expected stability of the business.
3.	Dividend pay-out ratio.
























The following are notes I found in a note book.  I believe they refer to 3rd edition

Page 327 – Charles Tatham Jr. had 2 useful ratios for use in Public Utility Bond Analysis.

Jay Sawell had a “Charges to Property Ratio.”    

‘Debt Service Requirements or Fixed Charges’ / Minimum Value of Property for Rate Making.’  If debt service ratio is 1% or 2%

Although simulations are imperfect and there is no substitute to investing with real money

35 people have registered for this competition, OCLR, PRXI, and BREW.  I am almost in last place.  I pursued a very concentrated strategy for the simulation and SVU is currently down 24%.  Only 4 of 35 people (itsmedog, nmelluzzo, Drited, and BusyBeingBorn) are currently beating the S&amp;P500's return YTD of 4.43%.  I expect this trend to continue as most active managers don't beat broad based indexes.

I have purchased stock in an undervalued company.  I have a fair value price target of 5$ per share.  The stock is currently trading at 2$ per share.  As is the case with an undervalued company, is it taboo to attempt to buy and sell during LOCAL minima and maxima, along the way to the expected fair value of 5$ a share?  Is this practice considered too much speculation on the part of a value investor?  I'm aware of the risks from all possibly scenarios, I would just like to get an opinion from those more knowledgable.  I realize this practice becomes much more risky the closer one would get to a perceived ""fair value"" due to increased downside, but is it taboo altogether?  Or is it increasingly more taboo as the risk involved is increased.  I'm not looking for a general investing answer because I realize that there are a million investing/trading strategies out there, as I am looking to become an unemotional, disciplined value investor I'm essentially asking if this practice is bad with that goal in mind

1364975715.0,1bkqza,What do you think about Lanxess?,flyingorange,7,3,8,"No one replied at /r/investing so hopefully someone from here will analyze this company with me.

In the last week the stock price went down more than 15%

Lanxess is a chemical company that produces all kinds of chemicals. Last year they invested a lot in producing tires. They made two acquisitions (small companies) and they both were somewhat related to the auto industry. In their annual report last week they said they had worse than expected sales due to low demand from car manufacturers

Here are some arguments why it's a good buy

* It's P/E went from 10.01 to 8.95 so now it's cheap (or in decline)
* Their profit for 2012 (=514) was *record high* and higher than in 2011 (=506)
* Their ROA and ROE is lower than in 2011 but only by a bit
* The company was created as a spin-off from Bayer in 2005
* Their EPS is 113% higher than the average for the previous 5 years
* Profit/Debt is 31.5% for 2012 and has been steadily growing since 2006.
* Profit/Revenue is 5.65% which is lower than in 2011 when it was 5.77%
* According to Graham's formula for determining the stock's intrinsic value
* ROIC is 5.89% which is ""just right"" (more than 6% would be ideal)
* P/BV is 2.61 so it's a little bit expensive
* Graham's formula for determining financial strength: working capital/(2*debt) = 0.65 while &gt;1 would be ideal. It's still better than in 2011 when it was 0.31
* They have less debt now than they had in 2011
* They have more cash
* Inventories went up a little bit
* Their gross cash flow was positive and higher by 200 million compared to 2011 (and is record high)

amazon.com... you at least get customer perspectives on the products

glassdoor.com... lots of comments from current and former employees. Be wary of ""sour grapes"" though. You can also get the average salary and compare that to other companies.
