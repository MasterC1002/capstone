1337007014.0,tmi6p,The ULTIMATE new-to-smoking guide.,Zuratuel,696,102,145,"So you're new to smoking? Good... I have a lot to teach you. 
In this guide I will go over the very basics. From buying your weed sufficiently

First

* Don't buy from random street dealers until you know who's sketch (sketchy / nervous)

* Never by all means buy shake (pre-ground weed). Any scumbag drug dealer will tell you: ""I ground this to save you time and to, google it) - you can always break / grind it all for yourself, and store it safely. Although when you grind it, the smell may be abit weaker, some say it reduces potency since the oils are released when ground. I myself keep it intact, and grind it when needed.

* If anyone is trying to sell you coco-puffs (marijuana laced with cocaine / crack) you shouldn't be buying from them in the first place. 

* When contacting a dealer, and unintelligent. Use short-cuts like: hey man, can I buy 1 for 10, etc. Don't directly talk about grams, ounces, or anything along those lines. - it's good to know how much one ounce is - 28 grams is one ounce. Each gram should roughly cost ten dollars, so one ounce should usually cost from anywhere to $200 to $300 depending how good your dealer says it is. Never buy anything for more than that. **(this depends on location

* If a dealer tries scamming you get the hell out of there

* If your dealer likes to sell from their vehicle, and do your business there. 

* Get a friend who grows, and maybe give you a sweet deal too ;)

* If you're going to mooch from your friends when your dry (out of weed)

* Learn the prices of weed locally, find one that you like.  Dealer will always be happy to sell you weed... Some may even share.

* Figure out how much one gram looks like if you're buying a lot of the same strain, because it may be water weight that your paying for. Don't ask for extra, just ask if the dealer has more strains if he / she doesn't catch on and add more.

* Start by buying lower quantities of weed, cops, and possibly a worried parent.

* Make sure your dealer isn't listing off a strain that is complete lies. Google some popular strains

Now

* There are 3 primary options for grinding your weed: **Grinders
Don't burn a whole bud

* If you're going to consume your marijuana by rolling it into joints google it. I suggest ""Ehow"" Tutorials. Youtube has a few good ones too. You can also ask an experienced friend to teach you / help you out.

* Don't try to be fancy when rolling, using a piece of thick paper as a roach (typically to filter out weed when smoking) 

* If you have nothing to smoke your weed, or even pipes, I myself created dyi bongs and pipes. Some materials may be hazordous to your health, so always be careful.

Here is a list of materials **unsafe** or **hazordous** to smoke off of / out of.

* Any type of plastic unless certified (extremely rare)

* Fibre glass

* Bottle glass, or anything not made for the use of smoking

* Metal is usually a no-no, or by talking to an Entspert (depending on the metal)

* Silicone would most likely be hazordous

Now

* Apples

* Carrots

* Oranges

* Melons (if you're willing to put the time into it)

* If you have a friend who's sharing their weed and you want to roll for practice

* When packing a bowl for the first time, and keep doing that until the bowl is full. Over compressed weed doesn't have enough airpockets to smoke sufficiently.

* Lighting a bong with a piece of burning wood works extremely well, wood matches are prefered since they have burn-time.

* There is usually a hole on the side that you hold onto on a bong, or rush. If you press your thumb on the hole the smoke inside of chamber gets inhaled, if you let go and inhale, the chamber fills, you can easily take many chambers full of delicious smoke by coordinating your thumb / finger off the hole

* ALWAYS bring an extra lighter, and forget about them.. A lot.

Now let's review stoner culture

* Bring water, so always be prepared

* If you're going to bring food you better be ready to share

* As I noted in one of my previous posts

* Treat a bong like a baby, don't punch it, or kick it.

* Weed will not in any shape or form make you noticibly unintelligent -  many intelligent **successful** people smoke weed daily.

* Weed will change your perspectives

* Don't salivate all over the joint

* Once the bowl is lit, you don't want to inhale butane fumes.

* Storage is key when dealing with marijuana, you can freeze marijuana but it may effect the bud. I highly suggest pill bottles, tupperwear, or double bags (try to suck out air).

* Eyedrops will clear the red eyes

* Learn as much lingo as you can



* **Cash** - when the weed in the bong is finished

* **Dry** - Out of weed

* **Shake** - Preground / broken up marijuana.

* **Blunt** - a marijuana cigar

* **Mole / Spliff** - a tobacco marijuana joint / cigarette

* **Roach** - the very end of the joint / the ""filter"" of the joint.

* **Bong** - a device that uses water put into a chamber

* **Lung** - a device that uses suction, contents usually contain toxic plastic fumes.

* **Bubbler** -  another name for a different style bong

* **Vaporizer** - a device used to heat the marijuana to a temperature under burning point

* **Swamp / Swamping** - Wetting the joint with your mouth

* **Couch lock** - when you're so high you can't move / get up. Usually associated with indica marijuana use

* **Indica** - A type of strain known for putting people to sleep

* **Sativa** - A type of strain known for it's effect on making you alert

* **The munchies** - when you get high and you constantly crave food

* **Body high** - A type of high that can be explained as your body is going through a sensation.

* **Dank** - Extreme pungency

* **Skunk** - weed that smells like a skunk

* **Sticky Icky** - a nickname for marijuana derived from the natural stickiness that marijuana has

* **Green** - another nickname for marijuana

* **Cotton Mouth / The pasties** - When you get high

* **G** - also known as Gram

* **O** - also known as ounce

* **Slice** - also known as an 1/8th of an ounce

So yeah


Happy toking my fellow Ents

1336865725.0,tk9j0,Tips from a seasoned Pro.,pileofdeadninjas,384,41,78,"So there are tons of great tips on here

* Single hits are king. Get a bong or bubbler, and make a pile for every session everyone can throw down and you smoke until the pile is gone (unless you don't want to). It's not good for outdoor smoking or when you have a huge group, but if you're like me and you smoke either alone or with just a few people, this is the best. Everyone gets greens and everyone gets as high as possible with the least amount of weed. If you have kief, sprinkle some on a single hit of weed and you'll only need 2 or 3 hits to get stoned.

* Take a good 15 minutes between tokes if you can

* Get a dealer you know and trust and go to just that person as much as you can. It's safer and you'll get better deals and you don't have to worry about getting ripped off...which leads to the next tip...

* Get a scale...even if you don't sell. You can check bags

EDIT: REMEMBER TO NEVER BRING YOUR SCALE WITH YOU ANYWHERE

* Clean your glass. It seems like the r/trees community and the like understand this

* Don't make it your life. Work hard and smoke weed. It makes a great incentive to get things done: finish your homework

* Be generally awesome. Let's make stoners look good,False,self,t5_2u279,True,,,t3_tk9j0

Here are some of those published articles dealing with this topic. I would like to give you guys direct links

* Zacny, 33 (2). Participants were split into 3 groups, each group holding the hit for either 0, 10 and 20 seconds. Mood, heart rate and carbon monoxide levels were measured before, during and after the hit. Results showed that the actual breath holding time did not have a significant effect upon the intoxication levels of participants.

* Zacny, 103 (2). Participants were randomly divided into 2 groups; either placebo and marijuana group. These groups were again divided into either 0 or 20 seconds hit-holding, with mood, heart rate and carbon monoxide levels being measured the same way as the previous experiment. Results were again similar to the previous study.

* Tashkin, 40 (3). In relation to breathholding time, results interestingly show that longer BHT's appear to enhance THC absorption. However, longer BHT's amongst the marijuana condition's participants contributed to greater blood carboxy-hemoglobin levels and greater amounts of inhaled tar. All this is also in comparison to *tobacco* smokers as well, so you can only imagine the bad shit going on in there while holding that hit in.

* Block, Roxanna &amp; Braverman, Kathleen (1992). Acute effects of marijuana on cognition: Relationships to chronic effects and smoking techniques. Pharmacology, Biochemistry and Behaviour, 43 (3). 
Over the course of the study, it could not be determined whether these effects were brought about by physiological or psychological reactions.

* Azorlosa, M. K. &amp; Stitzer, M. L. (1995). Marijuana smoking: effects of varying puff volume and breathhold duration. Pharmacology and Experimental Theapeutics, 272 (2). Over 2 studies, the first concerned with the quantity of the hit and the second concerned with breathhold duration, it was found that holding one's breath for extended lengths of time when taking a hit does not enhance the high.

Taste and memory are very closely related. When you eat something new and delicious, if you eat a bad batch of something, you're more averse to trying it again.

1. NEVER tell a non ent

2. Do NOT smoke out of plastic (such as pens made into pipes) aluminum (such as pop can steam rollers) copper, but only if with the correct knowledge of how to use, or with an elder who can assist!

3. Make sure when you get a stash box it isn't too suspicious. Keep something very common in your room that no one will touch

4. When smoking with people

5. Don't spray too much cologne

6. NEVER carry your stash box with you

7. Make sure you have cough drops

8. Never allow other people to ""hold"" your weed

9. Always listen to the elder ENTS unless It seems ridiculous and you know it's not right. They are always willing to help

Yesterday, and everyone was too damn high. One girl,  let's call her Sarah, was a major lightweight but she smoked the most by far. She went down to get some water. As I was finishing up rolling what we had left, I heard some yelling from downstairs. 

When I went to check (Which was several minutes later because I was baked), she couldn't stop screaming, laughing or crying the whole time. I was the only one sober enough to help her, so I spent the whole time trying to relax her. Even just watching it was one of the most horrifying experiences of my life, so much so that I almost quit trees altogether right then and there. 

In the morning, and didn't even clean off the chemicals. Luckily, everyone was okay, but I learned a few things I'm never gonna forget.

Actual tips:

1. Know your limit

2. ALWAYS make sure you're using a safe smoking apparatus

3. Make sure you trust who you're toking with

4. Look up how to handle a panic attack

1. Clean and completely dry a glass coffee pot.
2. Insert about a tsp of ground up weed inside.
3. Tape up all openings on the lid and spout of the coffee pot EXCEPT the small hole on the very top and a small opening at the tip of the spout that you can easily cover with your fingers.(top hole on lid will be your mouth piece
4. Turn your stove top on medium heat.
5. Place a finger over the top hole and spout hole and place pot on the stove burner.
6. Shake the coffee pot every several seconds while its on the burner to keep the weed from burning.
7. Keep a close eye on the weed inside the pot as you look for a clear vapor to start emanating from it and gathering inside the pot until it starts getting a little foggy.  (This should take only a few minutes. Depends on the stove.)
8. Take the coffee pot off the burner
9. Once the foggy vapor is exhausted from the coffee pot

Enjoy this highly effective vape method

EDIT!!!!!!:  DON'T FORGET TO TURN YOUR STOVE OFF WHEN FINISHED!

Edit: For those confused on how to tape up the coffee lid...The only reason for this is to create an airtight seal so no vapor escapes and leave two small holes that can easily be covered with one finger each.  If your pot differs from [THIS COMMON MR. COFFEE POT](http://www.nelsonappliance.com/images/catalog/MCPLD12.jpg) then you will just have to get creative with your taping method.

1. Do NOT start the conversation like a lecture. Be as casual and open as you can be. Simply saying ""I smoke weeds lul"" is not the best choice. Start by telling them you spent time thinking about the decision to use trees

2. Try not to bombard them with statistics. If they need to be used, so show them you're capable of not fucking up. Continue helping around the house, working hard, and communicating with your parents.

3. Tell them it will not change who you are. Because if it does

4. Never be defensive or aggressive

5. Tell them you are always SAFE wherever you are smoking. All they want is for you to go through life without a criminal record or a serious injury.

1341366178.0,w0dh6,Various informal tips to enhance your high!,WatchMeSlapYourShit,194,29,68,"- Always try and take an additional breath of fresh air after a toke

- Do not hold your breath for longer than 3 seconds after the rip

- While exhaling and you run out of breath and the smoke is still coming

- Make it a challenge to get a successful hit with the least amount of applied fire. With proper skills you can pull a fat bowl with only 1-2 seconds of lighting

- If inside

- To blow rings you need a calm environment (no wind or coolness)

- Always attempt to grind your weed

- If using plastic

- Resin can be smoked. It's not as potent as bud but it is smoke able and will deliver a high similar to hash. Resin collected from pipes

- Clean your paraphernalia occasionally

- Try to smoke on an empty stomach: Better high, you can eat 3 dinners and still get munchies, but the morning will be tough)
Some people report a better high after eating

- Always torch the corners first

- If buying an expensive water pipe

- Understand the difference between Sativa and Indica

- Always say you're bringing a scale when buying

- Do not share weed

- Never ever ever swallow your smoke

- If you're looking for a complete head-rush with a small amount of weed

Materials: 1 Bottle, Marijuana, Tobacco

    - Set-up a water bottle water pipe with just the stem
    - Place about 1 inch of tobacco inside the steam
    - Place the equivalent
    - Ensure proper air flow
    - Once ready
    - You should get a very dense stream of smoke, YOU WILL BE SICK AND VOMIT
    - As soon as the stem is empty
    - Make sure nothing is in your hands

Finally

Bong: Gives a boss feeling

Pipe: Mellow

Pail (or bucket): Honestly I prefer the bong or pipe over a pail

Popper: I don't enjoy poppers

Hookah: Don't like it

Joint: I love rolling joints

Blunt: Badass of badasses

First off I absolutely love this place but I feel like some of this stuff just keeps getting reposted. Would it be possible to get a moderated list pinned to the top of the front page linking to some of the things that get posted a lot? Kinda like a FAQ. Little list of tips to clean your pipe clean

Next, every post on how to get past a drug test, everytime you see a post on how not to get by your parents, we're losing supporters of legalization. I'm not trying to be that guy but if you're hiding, it shows our support of underage smoking and such. Though these things happen, in our battle for legalization, all of these things are working against us. Though this subreddit is kind and peaceful that isnt what outsiders see.

First off

1. Never brag. - This means, about your smoking. The more people know, the more likely you are to get caught.

2. Don't be stupid. Be patient. - If it's risky

3. Don't get overcomfortable. - No matter how safe you think you are

4. Scent is a very large indicator for smoking. - Smell is very important. Here are a few ways to reduce smell.
 
 * [Sploofs](http://i.imgur.com/3hsBD.jpg) are very helpful ways to reduce the smell. All it is
 
 * [The Smoke Buddy](http://www.amazon.com/Smoke-Buddy-Personal-Filter-Purifier/dp/B00478UIB2) is also a helpful alternative
 
 * [Incense](http://i.imgur.com/ZsNWT.jpg) are also *very* helpful for masking the scent. Just introduce your room/home to them so they can become common
 
 * The ""[Bathroom Method](http://i.imgur.com/ZxaDe.jpg)"" is one of the most flawless ways to smoke. Start up a nice, open it, and if not, it isn't a big deal. Put a wet towel under the door of the bathroom, closing off the escape route for smoke. Blow your hits into a sploof preferably, which is also better if you aim it at the air vent or window. 
 
 * Vaporizers are VERY useful

 * Spraying with FeBreeze, or using something like [this](http://www.amazon.com/Ona-ON10061-Pro-Gel-Quart/dp/B002JLGMEG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1337743546&amp;sr=8-1) will be very helpful for masking the smell.

 * To keep the smoke in a room

 * Even with a sploof, or continue to smoke. I always hav ea water bottle cap nearby, to put on my bowl to stop the smoke. A coin also works with this.

5. Smoking outside is good. - When you can, and you can enjoy the outdoors. 

6. Closets are good spots

7. Fans are life-savers. - Fans are one of the most effective ways of removing the smell. Open a window

8. Windows should be open. - Windows are the only way for the smoke to escape your room, this may just blow smoke further into your home.

9. One of the most important things is eye drops. They cost less than $4 at your local store (Walmart, as your eyes can become ""addicted"" to them, which isn't fun.

These are all my tips for toking stealthily

EDIT: I'll add user suggestions here:

* Don't let that towel stick out too far

* Wash yo' smelly hands. The smell sticks to your hands.

* Wash yo' smelly mouth. Gum or mouthwash works well.

* Make a super safe sploof by poking holes in the bottom of a water bottle and stuffing it full of scented dryer sheets. I've heard stories from people who used TP rolls and it didn't work out so well...

* Microwaving popcorn is a great way to make an overpowering smell to cover up other ones

* Cover your bowl with your thumb

* [Hogwash](http://www.amazon.com/Hog-Wash-Organic-Hogwash-1oz/dp/B0036QOV4Q/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1365092945&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=hogwash+1+oz) is a good spray to help remove the smell of weed.

* Roast some coffee. The smell will help mask it, coffee!

* People swear by [Ozium](http://www.amazon.com/OZIUM-SANITIZER-OZM-1-ORIGINAL-SCENT/dp/B000CSWCAG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1365093079&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=ozium). It is said to remove almost all smell,,False,self,t5_2u279,1365208138.0,,True

Now i know most Ents don't approve of underage smokers

1: Be educated. Knowing things will help you understand the lingo older Ents will say during a sesh. But also be educated on smoking etiquette too.

2: Be smart. If you start smoking, DO NOT, I REPEAT DO NOT bring your stash box, weed, lighter*, pipe, piece

3: Grades. This is the thing that will separate you from not being able to smoke, and the said the only thing we want you to have is great marks in school. If your marks drop, you wont be allowed to smoke. 

4: Listen to your parents. Just do it. Help around the house

5: Pitch in. This is a tough one. I get paid 20$ every two weeks for helping and doing chores. It is quite hard for people under the age of 17 to find jobs. Jobs=Money=Weed, with no money. Try to pitch in.

Naturally this works only with blunts, but not many pedestrians and smoke jays. If you roll them properly, they will look like regular cigarettes [try to avoid cones because that looks suspicious as hell].

The place I usually go is on a bridge that passes over a railway - it's kind of steep so a lot of people don't typically like walking over it - perfect - but cars can easily go over it. Most people would think to avoid the bridge because it's a pain in the ass

a : no pedestrians, you would, because people would automatically assume you wouldn't smoke chronic in the public eye)

b : you can easily toss the jay over the side

c : the smell is easily dissipated because bridges usually have high wind situations (or at least the one I go over does!). This makes it a little more difficult to keep the cherry lit

The best place to hide is wide out in the open - go places that are generally away from the smelling public nose

**Another tip** : If someone is passing by, take a big drag - this will suck in the smoke and the smell, (make sure you take it into your mouth and NOT your lungs. You do NOT want to hold the smoke for &gt; 3 seconds!! Headaches happen because you breathe in and hold in carbon dioxide!) and once they pass, you can inhale/exhale. Pretend you're looking over the bridge or something.

1337734908.0,u07w8,Complete Stealth Guide,PileOfTrees,135,17,40,"First off

1. Never brag. - This means, about your smoking. The more people know, the more likely you are to get caught.

2. Don't be stupid. Be patient. - If it's risky

3. Don't get overcomfortable. - No matter how safe you think you are

4. Scent is a very large indicator for smoking. - Smell is very important. Here are a few ways to reduce smell.
 
 * [Sploofs](http://i.imgur.com/3hsBD.jpg) are very helpful ways to reduce the smell. All it is
 
 * [The Smoke Buddy](http://www.amazon.com/Smoke-Buddy-Personal-Filter-Purifier/dp/B00478UIB2) is also a helpful alternative
 
 * [Incense](http://i.imgur.com/ZsNWT.jpg) are also *very* helpful for masking the scent. Just introduce your room/home to them so they can become common
 
 * The ""Bathroom Method"" is one of the most flawless ways to smoke. Start up a nice, open it, and if not, it isn't a big deal. Put a wet towel under the door of the bathroom, closing off the escape route for smoke. Blow your hits into a sploof preferably, which is also better if you aim it at the air vent or window. 
 
 * Vaporizers are VERY useful

 * Spraying with FeBreeze, or using something like [this](http://www.amazon.com/Ona-ON10061-Pro-Gel-Quart/dp/B002JLGMEG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1337743546&amp;sr=8-1) will be very helpful for masking the smell.

 * To keep the smoke in a room

 * Even with a sploof, or continue to smoke. I always hav ea water bottle cap nearby, to put on my bowl to stop the smoke. A coin also works with this.

5. Smoking outside is good. - When you can, and you can enjoy the outdoors. 

6. Closets are good spots

7. Fans are life-savers. - Fans are one of the most effective ways of removing the smell. Open a window

8. Windows should be open. - Windows are the only way for the smoke to escape your room, this may just blow smoke further into your home.

9. One of the most important things is eye drops. They cost less than $4 at your local store (Walmart, as your eyes can become ""addicted"" to them, which isn't fun.

This post is concerning lighters. The best, and what ever else.

**CLIPPERS**
The original weed lighter. A roach clip, awesome graphics, doesnt torch the bowl, cheap, easy to hide, and just amazing. Buy theese over anything else!

**BICS**
The next best thing. They are also cheap, an easy to remove safety, and just iverall great.  If you can master lighting them with your pointer finger, you will never have a burned thumb again. 

**Stick Lighters

Theese are typicly used by kids who dont own any bics. They are used for cooking, it can light a bowl, and it wont burn your thumb. Also stores will sell theese to minors (*especially* at dollar stores) 

**Torch Lighters**

Theese shoot a hot flaming torch of butane and cause extreme heat. But they are wind proof, refills tons!) Theese are found at home improvment stores on the welding isle. They are considered ""mini hobby torches"", but are used by meth smokers. They torch bowls if not used carefully, because unlike bics or clippers, you dont suck the flame into the bowl, you just put the torch to the bowl and suck. Keep the flame about 1 to 1.5 inches above the bowl. I only bought these for hobby-ing and lighting fireworks on holidays. They work well for lighting fuses on firecrackers. Theese are also good on blunts!

**Zippos**

Theese are not or smoking. They cannot be turned to smoke a pipe. They taste bad on joints. They are generally used by badass action movie heros

**Matches**

Matches can be great, your done for, and can add a bad taste. They are hard to work with when lighting a bowl. If you have a choice between theese and a lighter, always take the lighter.

**Buying lighters** 

1. Minors, because people dont relate stick lighters with smoking. Always say you are buying them for fireworks, or candles, or picking some up for an upcoming BBQ if the clerk ask. Gas stations are also good. 

2. **ALWAYS** GET BICS OR CLIPPERS INSTEAD OF THOSE SHITTY CLEAR LIGHTERS! The clear ones might cost a dollar for 8. Good deal right? Yeah, or it leaks or overheats. 11 cents a lighter may sound good. But Bics outlive theese lighters by weeks, months, even possibly years. 

3. If your a minor

As you guys know, will have a blanket restriction of terms that the government or their own management consider indications of intent to use for illegal activity (tl;dr, you're gonna smoke weed with that). 

Here is a (not by any means full) list of terms that must replace or be replaced.

* Bong: It's not a bong

* Bowl: Different headshops have different restrictions on this one

* Chillums: Unless labeled that

* Anything with a hose or whip

* Keif is pollen

*Not really for weed OR tobacco useage:*

* Those odd little things shaped like novelty vacuum cleaners? That's an ""insufulator"" used for snorting your poisons. 

* Hide-Away tins are what you'd call those stash cans

* Shake and Vape tends to be what they call those meth/crack vaporizers.


Also: The athletic socks are for huffing paint, those roses in glass tubes? People smoke crack out of those, and speaking of which, that copper steel wool is used as screens by crackheads who don't understand (or don't care) that when copper is heated, bad things happen to your lungs.

**Explanation and disclaimer:** I'm totally new to this subreddit, but I went to school in Boston, and making spliffs out of cigarettes helped me tremendously. Here's what you do:

1.) **Roll the tobacco out of a cigarette**: This is really easy. All you have to do is grip the cigarette with your thumb and index finger about a half inch before the filter and start rolling it between the two. Work your way down the cigarette and tobacco should start falling right out of the end. 

**2.) Use an unsharpened #2 wooden pencil to pack your spliff/joint**
I recommend using a mix of tobacco and weed, because it fits absolutely perfectly into a cigarette. All you need to do is add a little bit of weed, then a little bit of tobacco, then ram it down with the pencil like you were loading a Civil War cannon full of good times. (Note: I prefer a Ticonderoga ""soft"" pencil, but that detail is irrelevant). 

**3.) Pack that thing tight:** Finish off your spliff with a wedge of tobacco at the top and pack it down such that you can turn your cig upside down and nothing will fall out. I also recomment leaving that 1/2 inch of tobacco at the bottom of the spliff so that way you know exactly when the weed is finished.

**4.) Filter Removal:** Cigarette filters kill the magic of weed in my opinion. I don't know if there's science behind it or if its in my head, and you'll get that sucker right out. 

**5.) Make a filter out of business cards:** Or whatever you normally make filters out of. I prefer business cards b/c when I started this method, it was a tribute to him. 

**6.) Don't be stupid:** Obviously. Even though it will look like you're smoking a normal cigarette


Anyway, the best way to smoke weed without getting caught is to move to California, get your card, buy a piece and a lighter, and then proceed to smoke weed.

DISCLAIMER:  I am not guaranteeing you will pass, just stop.  These days even the lowly Walmart employee get tested going in and most traces for most users will be gone in a week.  Exhibit some self control people.  Since I know I'm talking to stoners, lets just call it a month (don't you just hate fat soluble metabolites?).  If you wan't to know how long for you specifically I suggest buying the drugstore cheepos and do a test run. They are reasonably accurate and will tell you when everything is out of your system.

For those of you who choose to live dangerously passing a drug test is all about diluting the metabolites of interest to minimal levels without making it look suspicious. This means drinking as much fluids as you can

1) Cranberry juice, and sometimes labs have the equipment to tell if you are doing this, but its better than nothing. Start doing this 2 to 3 days or so before the test to help flush your system. Cranberry juice is best because it is also a diuretic (helps you piss like a racehorse).  There's no need to go overboard, don't force yourself to drink gallon upon gallon because it will put undue stress on your kidneys, just try to drink a little more than you should for your body weight (which is probably a lot more than you do now you magnificent under-hydrated bastards.)

2) Get moderately (or super if you got the balls) drunk the night before.  Alcohol is a diuretic and it's not illegal to test positive for booze. If anyone says anything (and they won't) say it's not a common thing

3) Right before you leave take a piss in the comfort of your home. There's nothing suspicious about not being able to piss on cue and it will help clean out your system. This is especially important if it's your first piss of the day since that one will be the most concentrated. NEVER let them test your first piss.

4) If you're only worried about cannabis take the maximum recommended dosage of aspirin 24 hours before the test. There is SOME MINIMAL evidence the metabolite interferes with antibody based tests

5) If this test is for a high paying or high security job

It's odor free, inconspicuous, dogs can't find it, police won't bother, not difficult to dig up especially for a good high, and parents won't ever suspect it.


If you need to remember where you left it, or dig the hole close to something you won't forget.

- Hide it in a hole under a stepping stone.

You'll never forget where it is, nor would they ever dream of finding weed under them.

- Hide it in a blank disc holder (example photo: tinyurl.com/9bfuhv4).

Hide the ganja in the tube that runs up the discs. There should be an open hole at the bottom. Seal the bottom with something of your preference.

- Hide it in an old PC game box.

These never get picked up. A great place to hide it in the box is behind the manual or discs if there's enough room. Odor seal obviously not guaranteed.

- Drill or carve a compartment in an old Apple wall charger.

- Hide it inside of an old Sharpie magnum.

Stealthy like no other. Stick it inside a Capri sun and even a cop couldn't tell if you were toking right in front of him. 

Almost zero smell. Literally undetectable with high quality herb. 

No smoke. Vapor dissipates quickly and won't be visible if you mix dilute it with enough air. 

Healthiest way to get high. Saves your lungs. 

Produces cooked herb (avb) ready for a tincture (golden dragon) or edibles. 

And the list goes on and on. 

It's seriously life changing to realize you can get high any time

Oh holy shit I almost forgot my rule #1 - something I've not seen elsewhere. 

If you're not regularly cleaning your catcher, allow the grinder to maintain - even for a second - an upside-down position. Ever.

...

So here's what we've got: 

kief is a special treat that after a very long while;
           like receiving that unexpected gift.

add a coin into your grinder;
        ideally you need to get the lightest.

put the whole thing in your freezer over night;
         use a coin to shake around in the main chamber.

Grind up ya herbs and then put your grinder in a plastic bag;
        put it in the freezer for about half an hour;
  All of your trichs will freeze and fall to the bottom.

when cleaning it
         bang it on something hard.
the cold makes the crystals not stick.

2. Don't be cheap when making choices that could cost you: never talk yourself out of buying eyedrops, or any needed item to keep yourself looking and seeming straight. It may hurt your cash flow, but consider it as necessary as buying the product itself. (a few of my friends wouldn't do this and it drove me nuts at the school I went to)
3. Be extremely careful when texting. Know your friends and whether or not they keep their phones on them. Getting caught for conversations pertaining to smoking and not even actually smoking blows. In the words of fellow ent Scott Weiland (stone temple pilots) conversations kill:)
4. Leave no paper trail. Keep your stuff stashed unless you intend to use. Spray down, clean up any traces of bud or suspicious items together (ie lighter, drops, spray. each of these can be stored separately even in the same backpack and their distance makes them non-sus). On a related note: check out how to make a 1 hitter out of steel zebra pens is cheaper than buying disposable ones, and works extremely well!! Pitch when done.
5. Get some in the field training before being around parents or unapproving family members after toking. Acting natural takes practice.
6. Find excellent spots. Taking a few scope out walks might be worth the reward of a smoke spot that puts the others to shame. Take a break from toking to nail down select spots that will be the least dangerous/ suspicious. Wooded areas
7. Enjoy the ride: I may sound like I'm overacting to play it super safe

I think apple pipes are perfect. No noise


Making them are as easy as hiding them too.
 First

Then twist out the little stem thing on top and force a toothpick/paperclip from the middle until it hits the tunnel you made with a pen.  

You now have a pipe. Simply load the weed into the top where you poked the hole with the paper clip, let off the hole to clear it, and you have just hit an apple pipe. 

Also, and say you wanted to eat an apple out where it was calm and silent in the night.

No smelling

Weed, but can get you caught just as good. You need to worry about containing it before you even think about smoking it. If your like me, a mason jar doesnt appear out of thin air, and doesnt hide well. I have snoopy parents who like to dig through almost everything. But i have yet to be caught. 
Pill bottles are life savers. They are air tight. Youve seen them on here
Other great containers are: small plastic casings for containing ear plugs

But my all time favorite is in video game boxes. Unlike console games, under the little cardboard tray in the bottom of the box. I put some in my bioshock box or ect. and put it up in my extremely messy closet (i have 2 closets, a clothes closet and a junk closet) 

Also, all of my stuff is in the closet. If you have an xbox 360 slim, the unused memory compartment (sliding thing on bottom, opens up but invisible) is also great, because my parents are techno-impaired. 

If you put weed in old jackets
I have some old pictures that i can put a little behind the picture. But the weed has to be a little flat.

Remember flat bud isnt very pretty, nice nug is good to look at, until your parents are holding it in disbelief as you stutter out a weak excuse that it isnt your weed.

Weed at school is awful and very very stupid. Do not bring any weed, which is pretty much a bag in the bottom of the backpack that you can only get to from the shoe thing. Put it in the very end of the shoe thing, then fill the bag with clothes, ect. Its pracicly invisible if the bag has some stuff over it. 

Well after a mile long lesson

1346310046.0,z2es2,[Long] My guide to toking while living at home ,ObscuredBy,72,16,24,"Some of you might say these are not all pro tips

As a reference

In this guide I will be going over three stages of toking: the Pre-Toke, it is crucial to minimize risk in each stage.

Supplies Needed

* *A nice pipe (recommended) or a joint (not recommended)*

* *Lighter*

* *Eye drops*

* *Trees*

* *A CD or flat surface*

* *Car* (Optional)

* *Munchies* (Optional)

* *Ozium* (Highly recommended)

* *Box fan*  (Optional)

* *Dirty/sweaty clothes* (Optional


**The Pre-Toke**

You are not high yet; you have all your abilities at 100%. This stage should involve the most preparation and time.

1. * *Time*: As this guide is aimed toward college students who are home from break, it is safe to assume that the most optimal time to do this is the weekends. I always recommend waiting until after your parents go to bed. This could mean 9-10 or a bit later.

2. * *Place*: I cannot stress this enough: Smoking inside is VERY risky, you will be virtually impossible to spot. It will be dark, you will be shielded, and people should not be coming by.

3. * *Food and Drink*: You are going to be hungry later. You are not high right now, and it can stay in your room so you aren't out wandering around the house.

4. * *Trees* Have your weed preground if possible and in a baggy. Put the baggy inside of a small pill bottle, air tight bottle for transport

5. * *Pipe or joint*: I will say right off the bat I recommend a pipe over a joint. Joints are easy to conceal

5a. * *OPTIONAL AND NOT RECOMMENED: Pre-Loaded Pipe*: I do not recommend this method

6. * *Optional: Sweaty Clothes*: What is this, you might have some pretty gross sweaty clothes sitting around waiting to be washed. These will come in handy later. Put them in your car if possible.

7. * *Optional: Car*: No

This ends the pre-toke stage. Everything should be set up to make your life easy when you get back. After all

**The Toke Stage**

1. * *Gathering Supplies/Finding Spot*: Your pipe, and pill bottle full of weed should fit in your pockets. If you brought a CD along try to fit it in your pockets; otherwise carry it. Since you should not be going very far from your house and it is dark you should have no problem getting to your spot discretely. Take caution and look around to see if others are outside. If so, walk casually by and find another spot or take another way to your original spot.

2. * *At Your Spot* Start by organizing your items and making sure you are under the maximum amount of cover.. Keep your eye drops in your pocket for now. Get out your weed from the bottle and your pipe. If you brought a CD, and then carefully load the bowl.

3. * *Enjoy your spoils* But first

4. * *Leaving your spot* Put eyedrops in first. Check your pockets at least three times for your pipe, and the lighter. Now walk back to your house (remember, this shouldn't be very far away, but it should be far enough that most of the smell is left at the site.

**The Post Toke** 

1. * *Arriving back home* You still probably smell

2. * *Changing clothes* In your car you should have a change of clothes. As noted in Pre-Toke step 6

3. * *Showering* Boy, showering is awesome!

4. * *Fuck Bitches

5. * *Ozium* Spray Ozium in your room to neutralize any lingering particles. It's $4 at Walmart by the car fresheners.

6. * *Eat food


Hopefully this guide helps some people. Not everyone can apply this guide to them. If you toke up often it's almost useless because someone might notice a pattern. If you are someone like me who only wants to have a relaxing Friday or Saturday night, and every step assists in other steps. ",,False,self,t5_2u279,1346312627.0,,

It's not a great vaporizer
 
I have been trying out different heats/amounts of weed etc. and was just wondering if anyone else has any tips on using it/a similar type of vape?
 
Here are a few tips I'd give when vaping:
 
- Don't turn it to the max
- The weed should come out a dark brown colour, or have been burning the weed for too long.
- It's better to do 2 small bowls instead of one big bowl - One big bowl usually doesn't burn all the weed.
- It can be quite harsh on your throat
- The weed usually lasts for around 8 - 10 large hits. It has run out when you can no longer see any steam/vapour when you exhale.
- Have a stick or something handy to poke the vaped weed once you have finished - It sometimes sticks to the heating element. Don't try getting the weed out with your fingers
- Clean it regularly - It tastes much better after it has been cleaned. If you are struggling to clean the glass
- The vape I use usually needs about 3mins to warm-up before it is ready to smoke. It will vary depending on which vaporizer you are us using, it's ready to go - This is only for the cheaper vapes, more expensive ones will have their own timer/way of knowing when it's ready.
 
Anymore tips please feel free to post and I'll add them to this post.

But now I'm home for the summer and 2 things have changed.  The first is that I am now smoking much better weed.  It is obviously grown  much better, I've been turning the grinder until I can't hear the weed being ground anymore and the product is considerably more broken up than I could with my fingers but its not like its dust either.  Then when I go to smoke, Ill plug with an ungrounded bit and add the rest in.  I've also been packing it down pretty hard.  The problem is, this seems to be burning very fast.  Sometimes I'll only get like 2-3 good hits from it where this bowl has been able to do the same for 2-3 people from one bowl pack.  

TL;DR:
So I have several questions:
Can the weed be ground up too much so that it burns to quickly?
Does the way I press down make burning it away easier?  
I've also been getting better at cornering.  Is there any technique to this or is it just as simple as only exposing small sections to the flame?

**What you will need:**

* Papers.

* Something to pack with

* Grinder (Well

* Marijuana

* Pen (Something that has one side that's an uninterrupted cylinder)

*Crutch optional

Alright

Take one paper from the pack and wrap it around the end of the pen with as little of the paper in contact with the pen as possible. Think of it like your pen is wearing a really tall paper crown

Instead of lining the end up perfectly

I'm interjecting this here: Don't take the pen out until you've put your weed in

Now get a bit of saliva worked up, get a second pen and put it inside to give you something to apply pressure against. Use a liberal amount of saliva but don't make your cone soggy.

There's something about cruising through town, music is bumping, and everyone is having a good time.

But what happens when that cop you just cruised by gets a whiff of that ganja?  

A lot of people think they're safe when cruising, then the cop will be on your car's ass pretty fast. 

Here's some tips to avoid any trouble at all.

**1. If you're going to cruise bring ONLY what you need: lighter, and of course, the joint/blunt.**  

Don't be carrying around all of your weed, and that even if he does search the car (which he can't) there isn't anything incriminating.

**2. Know your rights

Cops need a warrant to search your car, and you are rejecting a car search, they'll threaten you with the k9 unit.  Obviously, if you have no weed on you, you are fine.  But if you still have some, you need to work on how to get it out of the car or ditch it.  

**3. Eye drops.**

They'll save you a LOT of trouble.  The cop will flash his light in your face, he'll probably become suspicious of you being stoned).  If your eyes are pearly white, it's less suspicious. Just an obvious heads up.

**4. If you have friends in the car

It's easy to forget what's going on when you're baked, play on their phones, text people to keep occupied..but not to be running their mouths.  It's easy for someone to forget and just mention weed, and cause a huge fucking problem if the officer hears the conversation.  Just have them keep quiet, and keep you, and themselves out of trouble.

**5. Get your parent's (or your lawyer's) number ready to dial on your phone.**

In the event that shit is about to go down (i.e. you have weed on you and they're going to bring in the k9 unit, tell them which police department you're with, where you are, and if you're going to be arrested.  Keep it brief and to the point.  After that, (even if you're not arrested) you have the right to remain totally silent.  Enjoy that right.

I got tired of losing lighters when people come over. Now, and then one above the smoking area.

Attach your lighter and seal the box of floss once you have a good length worked out, and the lighter will hang there. The video is my shitty attempt at explaining it.

For you new ents out there

1. Don't use A LOT of eyedrops. If you are anything like I am when stoned, it will leave them redder than they were to begin with.

2. You do need to wipe your eyes after you are done. Whether you are stoned or not. But always be sure to do this with a soft and clean tissue. Don't make the mistake I did and dry my eyes with a bath towel.

3. This one is probably the most obvious

4. Finally, and it feels *very* nice.

as fas as sexiness goes with smoke, or take a monstrous hit but good luck not coughing ;)

now onto my favorite smoke tricks!

smoke rings! 
i saw an ent on here describe doing a smoke ring as a VERY light cough, obviously.
if youre lucky enough you can make a heart by snapping just above the smoke ring a couple seconds after it comes out, why not try it? :)

french inhale! (also called the irish waterfall
this one seems really simple to me
alright.
the key to this one is NOT to inhale directly from the joint/blunt/hookah/what have you. the idea is to suck the smoke into your moth by increasing the volume in your mouth
you want the smoke in your mouth and you wanna block off your airway to your mouth with your tongue so you breath exclusively through your nose.
now, youre breathing out exclusively through your NOSE.
now heres the hard part: you want to gently inhale through your nose while very slowly closing your jaw
a variant of the french inhale is to do everything the same but when you inhale through your nose

thats all i got time for now, and simplest for me! try em out!!

Pack a whole bowl. Then, and then wait in between. You will most likely feel high before the bowl gets cashed. Just put the bowl back in a baggy (it may be slightly burned. Its still good if you can pull smoke off of it) then do the rest later. You see, your probably getting high enough before the bowl is completely gone. That way your not burning a whole bowl, but your getting high. 

Also, and so on. 


GET SOME OXYGEN. If the pipe has a carb, which will help get you higher. 


MANGOS. Its been posted 1000x times. I dont think I need to say anything else about it because you are going to eventually find it very quickly on here if you havnt already. 


DONT LET THE BOWL CHERRY. This is only for saving weed. After you hit the pipe, the bowl is not just burning away. Seal the carb and top completely to seal it. 


COUGH AFTERWARDS. Save those coughs for after you exhale the smoke. Coughing up while holding a hit will prevent you from getting the hit to its full potential.

Hiding Your Weed

I personally had somewhat nosy parents when I was a teenager, because things out in the open get messed with, and when that happens, eventually the nosy parent/nosy sibling will find it. Having a brother or sister down with it can be greatly to your advantage, but we will discuss that later.

1. Under carpet
If you have a closet full of junk, and work with the carpet until you can peel it up off of the tacks. Only pull it a few inches, and cut away a small amount of the padding underneath. Slip your bag/pipe/lighter/what ever ito the spot if it will fit, move the carpet back over the corner, and make sure it looks normal. Throw some junk over it too. Be careful when getting things out of this spot, becase you can easily be pricked on the hand by one of the carpet tacks. 

2. Deoderant stick

This method is easier
for transfering small amouts of weed. I reccomend getting a stick you dont use often, instead of sitting there spinning it, just like swing it outwards and the deoderant should slip outwards. Pull it out and grab the bag. 

3. Computer/xbox slim

Most windows computers can be opened. Simply place the bag inside and put the computer back together. Very easy and secret.

1336882505.0,tkkhx,Pro Tips For Outdoor Inner City Toking,footlong24seven,43,1,6,"As an outdoor toker for several years in NYC

I can't smoke in my parents’ house, so I'm forced to walk around public and populated places while toking. My usual spot is literally a block away from a police precinct. Here's what I've learned as an inner borough and city smoker:

1. Only bring out the stuff you're going to smoke, and is the most dangerous part of the outdoor smoking experience. Bowls with resin are too incriminating. If you suddenly find yourself in a pinch, all you have to do is eat the stuff and walk away free.

2. Find a secluded spot where you can toke and not be noticed. Roofs and backyards are great, make sure you have a good vantage point where you can spot cars and people before they spot you. If you have a 30 second advantage over the cops, you have time to swallow your stuff.

3. Darkness is your friend. It sounds obvious, because of the bluish hue of the night sky. Street lights don't normally illuminate dark areas when the sky is clear, but when there is heavy cloud cover, the street lights reflect off the clouds, turning the clouds into orange blobs which illuminate the ground and shadows. If the moon is out and it's cloudy, it's extremely difficult to use cover of darkness as an advantage.

4. The human eye is a wonderful device, which is why your spot should be in a dark shaded area. Cell phone use will blow up your spot. So will flicking your lighter, and even the little cherry at the end of your joint can be spotted in pitch blackness. When in a dark area, your pupils dilate to allow more light, ie you see better at night. Conversely, your pupils contract when exposed to light, so less light is allowed in. Put together, and someone is standing by a lit area, the human eye is designed to track movement and largely ignore anything standing still. If you’re being approached, standing still won’t help. Swallow your stuff or run.

5. When driving, again, is inside a park or schoolyard if no other options are available to you. Only police, on patrol, will look out the side window into these areas. It is a little known fact that police vehicles have stealth engines. They do not rumble or make noise when driving. This is extremely important to know because my friends wonder why cops appear suddenly out of nowhere. A way around this stealth is the “shucking” sound the tires make on the pavement when the car is in motion. That, too, is muffled on police cars

6. Know police behavior. Know how to spot an undercover car (the antennas and heavy tints are a giveaway).  I personally know the patrol routes in my neighborhood. If they’re coming up a block they don’t normally patrol, but no one gets out. If they were cops, and they seriously thought they spotted me smoking, they would jump out of the car in a heartbeat. 

7. Neighbors are not cops. Snitches exist, and in all my years no one has done that, because it’s totally futile. By the time the cops arrive, I’ll be done toking and not have a single nugget on me.

This guide is tailored for inner-city types like myself

1336596331.0,tfad9,A few tips regarding Red Eyes,djloreddit,44,7,5,"Red eyes: we've all had 'em

1. If you smoke weed for long enough without using eyedrops, because they can't afford to let people see them with red eyes. Once you are in a living situation where you don't have to worry about that, you will see the change.

2. There are two big factors that make your eyes red when you smoke weed. The first is the [vasodilation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation) effect of THC. THC causes the normally thin and hidden blood vessels in our eyes to swell up and become visible when we smoke(it also makes all the bloodvessels in your body swell, irritation from smoke will still cause red eyes. So be careful when you are hotboxing(bring goggles?)

Try to roll it smoother than mine. You will notice there is a bunch of paper bunched in your cone. Hence

**Step 2**: Roll another half piece of paper over your first cone and tape it. Like so:

Remove your second cone

**Step 3**: Take your hollow cone

http://imgur.com/1iZx3Qd 

**Step 4**: Trim away excess paper

Final Product Should be a hollow cone with a slit at the pointy end of the cone.

**How to use**:

1. roll crutch and insert into slit

2. Roll a king sized paper around the cone

3. Poke the crutch out of your rig with something narrow and long. The crutch should expand once pushed out.

Result: prerolled cone. http://imgur.com/1IVL9Zr

For the ents with steamrollers:

Hit the pipe like normal, and exhale back in the pipe. Once done with the first hit, inhale from the pipe again. This one is good for ENTS that are forced to ration bud. I've gotten to an easy [3] this way.

Joint/blunt tokers:

These tips could be used in theory for joints and blunts so

Tip 1:
While smoking

Tip 2:
Might be a given but

Tip 3:
Try to keep the leaf (The paper that wraps around the bud; be it a J or B) from becoming anything else than cylindrical. It's easier to hold and smoke.

Tip 4:
Don't flick a B like a cigarette to ash it. Blunts smoke slower so, you don't lose the cherry, or any usable bud.

Tip 5:
When smoking and down to the roach

Speaking of bongs

Bong tokers:

Tip 1:
Some tokers I know have long lamented about not knowing how much water to fill the bong with. I've experimented with different levels of water with different bongs. Fill until the stem is about 1.5 to 2cm immersed in water.

Tip 2:
When lighting the bowl, whatever into the bowl. If you put the flame too close to the bowl, you risk torching (actual BURNING of the trees) and having the side of your thumb singed. Let the bowl properly light by itself. It should light sufficiently enough to hit it but not cherry.

Tip 3:
More as a rule of thumb

1337651640.0,tyjh8,A (not so) brief guide to cleaning glass,MrPartridge,39,7,16,"Hello Ents! There's nothing that matches the feeling of taking a fat rip out of a brand new piece of glass. But what about when your piece starts to stink? Slide gets clogged? With these steps

**If you want to skip all the theory and get right down to the nitty gritty

**1. Why is this so hard to clean?**

If you've ever tried to clean a piece before, the brown and black gunk will remain stuck on, no matter how hard you might pry and scrape. This is because resin, due to its chemical makeup, is not water soluble. Water is useful for breaking ionic bonds, like those found in salts, but not so great for weed related chemistry. This is similar in concept to why one must use oil or fat when extracting weed.

What DOES dissolve resin is alcohol. All different kinds of alcohol

Look for something that has a high concentration of alcohol, and relatively inexpensive (I picked up a litre for $10 CAD, but your mileage may vary). **However, I found that alcohol based mouthwash is the best substance for cleaning resin off of glass.** With that in mind, let's establish some basic tips.

**2. A warning**

This process is messy and very, as well as a nearby garbage. Outdoors or in your garage are good.

**3. Materials**

* Alcohol based solvent. As I already mentioned

* Rice. Alcohol isn't always enough to get your gunk out, though: rice is sometimes very difficult to remove from glassware, and I would avoid using it for pipes, bubblers and percolators.

* Pipe cleaners: as some have pointed out here before, some contain copper fibre that MAY damage your glass.

* Cotton swabs: great for detail work

* Containers of various sizes: this will be used for submerging smaller items. For best results when bong cleaning, but it will be worth it.

* Rubber gloves: optional, but I used latex gloves and Listerine, and I was fine.

**4. Okay
I agree.

* If you're cleaning a bong

* Place the smaller items in a container and fill with mouthwash. Fill bong with mouthwash

* Let sit for a bit. Go watch an episode of South Park or My Little Pony or whatever.

* For bowls

* For the bong, lest it slip and break. The idea is that the rice rubs up against the walls where the resin is most concentrated.
*Repeat as required until the resin is gone.

* Clean the piece with soap and water. This will remove any alcohol or resin scent left over after the cleaning process.

- Look up the law

- no fancy body kits

- while tricked out rides are suspicious

- Try to keep it as stock as possible.

- Subwoofers do nothing but draw attention for no reason. In wisconsin you can get a disturbing the peace ticket for music that's ridiculously loud.

- Don't put ""legalize it"" bumper stickers or any drug/anti-establishment advertisements on your car. If I were a cop I'd pull over the car with ""fuck the police"" across the bumper way before I pull over the clean car with 4 guys smoking cigarettes and laughing. 

Ok

I drove a ford focus with underglow, and a spoiler. I also had 2 500 watt subs in the trunk. I got pulled over for illegal tint level and ended up getting 3 different tickets for my car and a possession of paraphernalia ticket. I now drive a 2001 minivan. It's probably the best vehicle I've ever owned. It gets decent gas mileage, it comes stock with tinted back windows, and no cop suspects a guy driving a minivan (guy driving a minivan=kids=dads don't smoke weed... where theres kids..). I also took out the back row of seats, so there's room for 5 people, plus there's a space in the back to make a hookah circle. 

Ok now I'm just gonna throw down the Wisco rules for cruising in case anyone doesn't know yet:

- Driver picks music

- Shotgun packs/rolls

- If you don't know how to pack/roll

- Whoever calls shotgun gets it

- Puff puff on joints/blunts

- If you don't get a good hit, cash it out, etc.)

- If there is one bit of slobber on the joint/blunt/piece you get punched in the arm

- Don't cry wolf

- Don't fuck with people in the car

- Stay active in the group. If you're in the car

- If you feel sick

- Don't bring alcohol in the car. Cops can give the driver a ticket for having open containers in the car.

- No matter how many rules someone breaks

- GOLDEN RULE - Driver makes all rules. If the driver has rules about his car (ie. no hot boxing

Heres how I sneak out for a bowl or 2. 

The day before or when ever:
Find a door or window that is silent when your parents arent home. 

Find a tree or spot that has a place to put your trees and lighter if your parents come out. Make sure there some distance between it and the house so the smell.

That night:
Use dirty laundy and pillows to make a figure in your bed. If you have brown hair
 If you sleep with the tv on
Then pack the bowl or roll the joint and get the lighter. Set the pipe down and silent walk out to make sure your parents are asleep. Then get the pipe
Gently unlock and open the door. 
Open it up only enough to get through, close the door (where it doesnt snap when the door closes.) then walk to the tree that you chose. Turn your back to the wind and quickly smoke. Occasionally look at the door. 
Return inside, and lay down or what ever you do while high.

Now, as I believe it is the safest way to do so. My frients and I successfully toked almost everyday of last semester in a very small room without a single run-in with RA's or law enforcement. Here are my tips:

The Set-up: Put a fan in your window

The Toking: The most important part of the operation: PACK SNAP BOWLS. This means pack just enough greens for your own hit and make sure you snap it through (but without sucking too hard and snapping still-green trees). This step assures that nearly no smoke is released into the room, into the fan facing out the window (or ghost it if you're a badass). 

Aftermath: Spray some febreze for good measure and do whatever it is you love to do when you're stoned. Personally, you won't get caught.

P.S. don't get lazy and skip a step

TL;DR: Pack snap bowls, through window, febreze and of course don't forget to bring a towel.

As for food, apple/pumkin pie, soft pretzels, strawberries, pineapples, green grapes, french fries, and anything else I normally would enjoy like BBQ

1. Always make sure you have something available to eat before you toke up. Nothing worst than munchies and no food.

2. Chew some gum after you finish eating. It helps cotton mouth shit tons.

3. If you haven't had good cake or fruit to fix up your munchies

Basically, and carry them with you when you toke in public. This is especially helpful when smoking in cars. If anyone approaches, light up a cig, and puff it hard and fast, but dont inhale. Basically try to produce as much smoke as possible to cover the odor of weed. Its isnt guaranteed to mask the smell totally, especially if hotboxing, but the odor is strong and as long as you hide any glass or weed it has potential to get you out of what could be a sticky situation.  

For example: 
Just the other day me and a fellow ent decided to blaze before a movie, It appeared we were enjoying our cancer sticks before attending the movie, when the security guy stopped to ask what was going on, we said we told him just enjoying a cigarette, and he went on his way.

TL;DR: Use cold eyedrops or ice cubes.

The theory: Smoking reduces the pressure inside your eyeball; this causes the blood vessels in your eyes to dilate and become visible. Usually

But blood vessels constrict also if exposed to cold.

So
# single dose (you don't want to get an eye infection)
# unpreserved (no unnecessary nasty stuff)
# saline
and keep it in the fridge. If you need relief on the go

For emergencies and stubborn redness: Massage ice cubes on closed eyelids. 

The effects are not as lasting as with visine

Bonus: Saline drops are not as suspicious as visine and the likes and a lot cheaper. ",self,t5_2u279,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/StonerProTips/comments/12ntk3/get_rid_of_red_eyes_in_a_safe_way/
