I was working on a rush project and had to build some custom fixturing to accomplish a certain task.  I threw together the design and - being in such a hurry - didn't bother to spec welds.  I just took the drawings to the fab shop, ""Weld the crap out of all these joints.""

What he apparently heard me say was

The part was finished.  I even proof loaded it... But I've no idea how it survived the proof load because shortly after putting the unit into service a weld broke and we quite literally dropped a bomb (I work in the ordnance industry).  Upon inspection

1. Me: I griped in a post about the way Android will display a strong signal on some WiFi access points
2. Response: ""Your phone has a better idea of the true signal once it tries to connect - it gets information about latency and dropped packets that won't be available otherwise. The actual hardware changes from monitor to active mode....""
3. Me: This issue doesn't seem to happen on Windows. [not in my original comment, and Windows simply doesn't display an updated signal strength of after it factors in latency and dropped packets]
4. Response: This is because laptops have more powerful WiFi adapters.
5. Me: That doesn't make sense, but access points at the edge of reception would still be marginal.
6. Response: It makes sense, WiFi range is mostly a function of the router.
7. Me: Factually, no matter the power, you would always expect that the access points on the edge of reception would be marginal.
8. Response: Link to Wikipedia on Inverse Square Law

Growing up with lots of little toys that ran on DC, as two unrelated devices desiring the same voltage often use the same plug.  Laptops, however, seem to have no rhyme or reason to their plugs.  They appear to have the exact same range of gazillions of possible plugs.

On a desktop, and I can use whatever AC plug I find lying around.  Internally, all the components use the same DC plugs from the power supply.  Once in a blue moon, you might find a component that comes with an adapter, but that's generally to account for your power supply just not having enough of a standard plug (the most simple being fan adapters).

Now I realize that laptops are still highly proprietary and the internals are almost guaranteed to be plug-n-play incompatible, and, on older laptops, wireless cards.  That said, why aren't the power bricks standardized?  Why does Lenovo (for example) have small plugs, large plugs, and now [a rectangular plug](http://i.imgur.com/X6lYQ.jpg)?

**Question:**

I know of women who can carry 15kg objects in their arms all day (taking frequent breaks) without experiencing back pain. However, they experience backaches in their lower and mid-spine within the hour. Why is this? Why do their backs not grow strong enough over time to support this weight? Also, how exactly does a bra redistribute force such that breasts no longer cause back pain?

Please don't brush this off as trolling; many people near and dear to me have suffered severe medical problems as a result of poorly-supported breasts, experienced early-onset osteoarthritis of the spine, possibly due to very unsupportive bras--the very weight of her own breasts may have induced severe trauma/injury to the cartilage between her vertebrae. I am also a female with 2.5kg breasts, and am concerned about developing this condition.)

**Suppositions/Possible Factors:**

* Range of motion experienced when carrying a heavy object is more limited (only standing
* Breaks are taken when carrying a heavy object to allow time to recover.
* When carrying a heavy object, and shoulders are involved. With breasts, only muscles of the back and shoulders are involved.

To what degree is the various equipment susceptible to salt water damage?

Is there a lot of damaged equipment that is irreplaceable

Reddit just implemented the ability for subreddits to allow user-editable flair.  In other words

To edit your flair

I've provided several templates.  Those templates

Appropriate **disciplines** include civil, nuclear, chemical, software, electrical, computer, petroleum, and MORE.  You get the idea - likely it's what your degree says.  

Your **subdiscipline** is much more varied and specific

**Students** have flair options as well if you want to choose one.  You don't have to - you can just put down your discipline with no student or school tag if you want.

**RULES:**

- If you're unfamiliar with how the flair works here

- Must be engineering flair, but please ask first.

- Follow formats provided

- The word ""engineering"" or ""engineer"" is not needed in the flair

- Please nothing too ridiculously specific for the subdiscipline.  

- No PE, BS, MS, PhD, or other post-nominals.  This is not about credentials, it's about interest.

- Mods can and will edit or delete your flair if it violates the rules.

Feel free to ask any questions.

I have a wireless dog fence [like this one](http://store.petsafe.net/wireless-containment-system). We recently had cable internet installed and it changed the boundary of the fence. The cable seems to be acting like an antenna for the wireless transmitter. [See this diagram](http://i.imgur.com/TTGLEHq.png
) This has the affect of extending the boundary in an undesirable way. I am looking for ways to eliminate this interference.

So far I have tried:


* Checking the ground at the cable entrance to the house
* Grounding the shield of the cable nearest the transmitter
* Moving the transmitter as far away as practical from the cable lines inside the house


My next thoughts are to try a high-pass filter (the fence operates at 17.5kHz) or to pull up the outside cable and put it in metal conduit then rebury it.

1370948295.0,1g43ir,"Why do we have limited color spaces and then engineer our displays to try and match those spaces, to the point where being able to display more colors is regarded as a bad thing, instead of targeting as our color space the full range of all visible colors?",caliber,43,21

So in [this diagram](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/Cie_Chart_with_sRGB_gamut_by_spigget.png), for each point in an image, you have three values, indicating how strong the red, green, and blue are at that point.

From what I've been reading, there are other color spaces as well, such as Adobe RGB that has a wider coverage of visible colors, or CMYK that matches up better with inks that create color by subtracting from white.

However, then the colors will appear oversaturated (and if you do the opposite they will appear dull). This is because the color space of sRGB is a smaller triangle than that of Adobe RGB, and so if you take the same numbers and plug them into Adobe RGB, you end up proportionally farther out from the center.

As a result, you don't want a monitor that can display more colors than sRGB, as you'll end up with oversaturated images.

This can be compensated for by using color management, allowing viewing of normal images on monitors with wider gamuts such as Adobe RGB-calibrated monitors, but most monitors don't ship with the profiles data to do this, and since almost all images are encoded in sRGB anyway, there isn't much incentive for the average user to buy a monitor that can do more.

All this leaves me with a question I'm having difficulty locating an answer to

Instead of a limited color space, y values of where a color is on that chart would be sufficient (along with brightness, transparency, etc.), and could even be used to store information on colors outside of the average human's visible field. Then, a display device could simply clip values outside of its own maximum capabilities, and more colors capable of being displayed would always be a good thing. Furthermore, universal

Are they a holdover from an era when it was prohibitive to include a chip to convert these values into something a given monitor would be capable of displaying?

The laptop itself is a Latitude E6500

The shocks are of fairly low strength

They happen fairly intermittently, and it's fine, and then out of the blue it'll just shock me a bit.

So what exactly is going on here? I'm guessing the fact that my power adapters are ungrounded is a factor. Nonetheless

1368410567.0,1e7whe,"Not sure if I can ask this here, but... am I paranoid, or living in a death trap?",raventhon,42,16, but I'm a little bit at wits end about this inquiry. Let me try to sum this up as briefly as possible:

I live in Japan

I'm not an architect myself (so I'm sorry for my lack of technical knowledge!)

I was so enamored with the great location and low price of the house that I did not notice some obvious flaws until I moved in.  The first, but the house can also shake quite violently when a truck drives slowly on the major road 2 lots away from the house.  My place of work also shakes when trucks go by directly out front, but to a far lesser extent than my house.  My place of work does not shake at all due to traffic on the major road.  

So here's where things get really dicey... there are cracks running through many of the walls and ceilings of the house, and are made of very lightweight material with wallpaper on top. (and no, they're not just edges of the wallpaper, which is what I'd initially hoped) This is a gallery of what they look like: http://imgur.com/a/aCSkM#653B21S  

A few more things about the house: it's located on a former rice field that had dirt piled on it, refuse to open/shut correctly, like the frame around it is warped; some of the doors also don't shut correctly as well.

Anyhow, which means heavy equipment rumbling by on a daily basis for the next 4~5 months.  I hope I'm being paranoid, but between the shaking and the cracks, I'm not sure how the house will hold up to the stress of drilling, paving, and building literally feet from my door.  Everyone here has told me not to worry about it and they won't help me take any action (well, my Japanese friends, while my boss has expressed some minor concern about the cracks in the walls.  

Thanks for any help or advice you can provide.  I'll also gladly take more pictures if they'll help the diagnosis.  Also, that'd be great.  The Internet is full of signs of imminent building collapse, but basically only for big concrete buildings, and I'm in a bit of a different situation... thanks again! :)

What minimum amount of resources would you need to eventually develop an industrial society?,unconscionable,43,13,51,"I've always been curious about how much we depend on existing infrastructure to perpetuate an industrial / post-industrial society. The idea isn't all that original either - think Robinson Crusoe, well

If we were to strip away all our infrastructure and all we had were our brains and plenty of hands

Let's say you and a small population were transported to an earth-like planet (for the sake of simplicity, suppose you have a couple trinkets from earth. Maybe a laptop that has an archive of wikipedia and a handful of engineering / science textbooks? 

Unless hunting &amp; gathering seemed to be an easier solution for the medium term, I'd try and build some sort of [bloomery](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomery), and attempt to smelt iron ore or whatever types of metallic ore I can find. (I suspect iron ore looks something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/0NTLo.png) so I'll know how to identify it in the wild.) Then I'd try to figure out a way to turn that smelted metal into wire. Then I'd try and find a magnetic rock (which for all I know would be as difficult as finding a gold nugget in the woods). Then I'd try to use my wire and magnetic rock to build an electric generator, and build a water wheel or something to power it. Not quite sure what i'd do from there, but hopefully from there I can at least figure out a way to charge the laptop without blowing it up.

Pretty sure I'm not capable of doing all that with what I know right now, I suspect that could at least get us to the 15th century or so. Maybe my next goal would be to try and build a transistor, although I suspect that would take considerable more infrastructure to create [after looking at a picture of the first transistor built](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/Replica-of-first-transistor.jpg).

Let's start by assuming the presence of an underground river or other major subterranean water source nearby

**Light**

The first major issue that jumps out at me is light. In order to sustain lighting

The most plausible electricity sources seem like underground rivers and geothermal activity. If we already have an underground river

**Food**

The next major issue I think would be food. Judging from existing troglodytic creatures, let alone a whole community.

However, whether it would contain sufficient nutrients for survival, and what the plants or fungi or whatever is being farmed would require in terms of a substrate on which to grow.

If the underground river is bringing in fish and other food sources from the outside

**Air**

It seems like caves, but is there a limit to this that would become significant?

**Other**

The power generation and lighting would require a fair bit of technology to work. Once the community has been surviving for a few years

Earlier this month I scored a phone interview

First of all, I'm not just interested in the base pay.

At my current cushy government job I earn about 4 weeks of vacation a year plus 13 days of sick leave. The new job will only get me 3 weeks per year until I've been there for 5 year (and only 2 weeks for the first year).

I also won't get as good of retirement benefits, when it goes up to 4%.

Life/Health/Dental/Vision insurance are just about a wash between the two

So if I take the new job I lose out on sick time, but I get a substantial pay raise out of the gate, and more potential pay the longer I stay with them.

As for the job itself, but it's also not challenging in the least, and I'm using less and less ""engineering skills"" each year and it's becoming more and more bureaucracy. I'm honestly a little worried that if I stay with the government job for too much longer I literally won't be able to go into an engineering career because my skills will have totally atrophied. Meanwhile the new job sounds exciting and fun, but could very well just be a case of the grass being greener. I have some friends that work in the same department I'd be going into, and they obviously have their own complaints, but they've been there for about 5 years now and still enjoy it.

I've always thought engineering would be perfect for me. I love math

My question is what can I actually expect out of a career in engineering. I'm still unsure of whether or not I want to do mechanical or electrical. I'm leaning pretty far towards mechanical. I don't think I want to do chemical (don't want to work for an oil company) or civil (don't want to work for the government). But I feel like I may have an overly romantic idea of what MEs do. I worry that it's less hands on than I want it to be and far more sitting at a desk doing math. I'm not afraid of the leg work, or silent wind turbines that don't piss off the neighbours, or a suction cup that actually holds the GPS to the window... Is this realistic or will I actually be spending 20 or 30 years redesigning and then redesigning again the same slightly stronger slightly lighter steering control arm for a ford focus?

I need to know if it is worth my time and effort to study to join your exalted brotherhood. I'm thirty five and I'm married with children so I'm not a typical student that comes on here asking for advice. I have some college behind me, because I can't double up much of the math I have to take. 

Why am I doing this?  Because I have to do something and whatever I train to do now is what I'm going to have to do for the rest of my working life. I have been a very successful locksmith for quite a few years. I have even worked closely with various engineers over the years designing custom locking systems for various things. Aircraft to Zoo's, and it has progressed to the point that the fine motor skills I need to do the work is failing. So I know I have to retrain myself to do something else, and I have to do it now. It was like being twenty years old again, coming to that realization, when I was twenty I had been in college for two years and was absolutely sure I didn't want to be a lawyer anymore. I was able to get my first locksmithing job and just shelved school until I knew what I wanted to be when I grew up. So here and now, I want to be an engineer, but I'm not sure if I should  follow this dream or not. I guess you could say my health and my looming failings in my long time profession have created something of a mid-life crisis for me, rather than giving someone a bullshit boost of confidence. I'll list some bullet points to help break all this down.

So here are my questions:

1). At 35 years old estimating it's going to take 4 to 5 years to finish a BS degree in engineering and expecting to work until 65 or 70 years old is it worth it?
     A&gt; I will have to use student loans
     B&gt; I do live in an area with a strong job market for engineers, electrical, some but less civil and always software engineers. 
     C&gt; 'Worth' in this context means is the income to investment sound considering age

2). Given point B above I have looked at what ""kind"" of engineer I'd want to be. I have to enter into this with a plan. I've looked over the university web-sites and while their overviews are ""nice"" they aren't really informative. In fact going by them I would expect to work in groups of attractive and diverse smiling people who like to gather around tables. From what I've read most of the disciplines overlap and a mechanical engineer is considered a ""jack of all trades"" engineer?  So here is the actual question:* What discipline would you most want to do from mechanical

If the power from the solar inverter only provides the current that is required (can be consumed by nearby houses/loads) on the local low voltage (240/415v here in Aus) system then are we looking at people not getting the expected generation/payback from their solar systems

So, seeing as elevated railway is acceptable, one option is to start the climb ""earlier"" and have a shallower grade for a longer run.

The problem, with several tall and obtrusive pillars holding the railway itself. So I thought to myself: if we want to save on building several pillars, why not build a cable-stayed structure then? That's where I hit a wall: I know that cable-stayed bridges have been built, with ginormous spans, but they're usually flat. All my googling couldn't find any example of a hill-climbing cable-stayed bridge.

So that's my question: would that design be sensible? The relevant elevation profile can be seen here http://i.imgur.com/DAUWhF6.png

I'm looking to size a pump. I need a positive displacement pump that can put out 1m3/min into a 60m long line which feeds into an in-service pipeline operating at 500psi (3.5MPa). The friction losses in my 60m line due to the fluid are 22psi (150kPa). Is this enough to calculate the head and hp of the required pump? The 1m3/min is the rate at which fluid from my 60m line should enter the in-service line at.

I think the same sort of puzzles and motivations that applied to those activities apply to mechanical engineering.

I'm looking for some solid advice on how to accept an offer from a company for which I've been ""interning"" for the last year and a half.  Although the offer they extended is a raise from my current pay rate

I've been doing research on websites like Salary.com, and PayScale.com.  What I have found is that there are wildly different predictions on what I should make, here is a summary of this data:

All sites were supplied with the same information:

* Mechanical Engineer I
* 1 year experience (actually been interning at this company 2.5 years)
* 100-250 employees
* San Jose
* Degree from Santa Clara University (top 20)



* Salary.com: **72k**
* Indeed.com: **101k** &lt;--- WTF? Sounds unreasonable
* EngineeringSalary: **75k** 
* Payscale: **54k**
* Homefair.com **72k**
* JobSearchIntelligence.com **68k** &lt;--bottom 10th percentile

My current offer is for 63k which is 5k more than I make as an hourly intern.  The benefit package is just about the best you can get (profit sharing

My question is this:  How do I present this information to attempt a massive renegotiation of the offer?  I myself do not trust the accuracy of these websites and wonder if there is a better data set I can present.  Is it unreasonable to ask for at least 70k?  What do other low level experience MEs make (if you feel like divulging that info)

Any advice, I really don't want to get screwed on my 1st offer. 

Thanks!

**edit:**  Wow, far below the COLA of about 50%.  He took my argument upwards and I ended up with an offer for 65k.  
I think the take away here is that **it never hurts to do your research and learn more about what your company will and will not do for you**  Had I just accepted I would've left money on the table and not had the experience of learning how they came up with my offer.

Our parts are qualified in via a shaker test for 10 hours at a given PSD. I analyze them first to find problem spots early and fix them before they fail on the actual table. The analysis technique is explained fairly well in [this demo

Essentially, and 4% of the time it's under ""3-sigma"". Then, for the full test, you take (10 hours)\*(natural frequency)\*.68 to determine how many cycles it experiences at 1-sigma; do the same for 2- and 3-sigma; then apply Miner's Rule to determine whether the part would fail during the test. 

Where I'm unsure how to proceed is when there are multiple significant natural frequencies. Our geometry typically has 2 or 3 modes which have similar magnitude stress responses. My thought is to break the response PSD into pieces and treat each peak separately - find the 1-sigma associated with frequency 1, that doesn't seem to account for when the two frequencies are in phase, when most of the damage would occur.

**Hardware:**

ARMv9 dual-core 1GHz SOC (ultra-low power) + arduino combo (high/low level control) running linux with
1 x 3-axis accelerometer/3D magnetometer 1 x 3-axis gyrometer 1 x pressure sensor 1 x GPS

Pan/Tilt/Zoom frontal camera

Ubiquity Bullet M2 long range wifi

3 x EDF each with 17N maximum thrust

2 x 6800mAh Li-Po battery

Carbon fibre frame and exterior

**Specifications:**

[figure 1

Conservative estimations:

I am no aero expert so please correct me if I am wrong, it would appear they are in close proximity. (I assume this would be the point?)

Without considering any fuselage lift

I am not sure about lift and drag calculations but I will give it a shot, area of wings + fuselage = 0.04429m^2

[figure 2

lift force = ½ρV^2 × coefficient of lift × area
            = 0.5x1.08x27.78sq2 x 1.5 x 0.01596
            = 9.98N

1324390254.0,njuhl,I want to make a HUD for my car.,Rhakan,23,4,15,"Long story short

First step was to view the wikipedia article for a heads up display: [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heads_up_display).  This makes it seem like HUD is relatively simple.  You take a source and project it onto a piece of glass and make sure it's focused to whatever distance you want it to appear in front of you.

The next step was to do some reddit searching.  I located [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/mxy83/question_about_hud_on_motorcycle_helmets/) post which discusses why no company is developing them commercially
[This](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/lelsh/i_want_to_create_a_helmet_with_a_hud/) post has even less information.  It's some high school students who want to make an HMD (helmet mounted display) and have no idea what they're doing.

Then it was off to Google.  I located one commercial product called ""night driver"" which apparently projects an infrared camera view onto the bottom of your windshield.  It appears to require professional installation, at all.

There's a lot of people that take their GPS unit
1) The distance from windshield to apparent image is the same as the distance from windshield to GPS unit.  This places the image about 6 inches in front of the windshield
2) Even light to moderate sun glare destroys the image completely.  
3) Hard to operate the GPS when it's lying upside down over the steering wheel.  

There was someone online making a HMD with beam splitters and ""pico projectors"", but absent was any mention of how to focus the display properly.  His blog has not been updated in some years, I have no idea if his idea went anywhere.


Now
- Ideally, mounts, etc.  
- Eventually I'd like to project GPS instructions onto the display
- Must be tolerant of moderate sun glare.  I don't necessarily need to drive straight into a sunset
- Must be capable of focusing the image to approx. 50-100 feet in front of the car. *(reasoning below)  I'd like to be able to adjust the focus on the fly (with some kind of knob), drilling new mounting holes, remounting, etc.).  
- Color projection is nice, and that's cool)  
- Must not cost a huge amount of money.  I have (essentially) free access to spare materials like wood, various tools, a machine shop for prototyping purposes.  


My current idea:
Mount a ""pico-projector"" (""handheld"" projector) above my head and project it onto a flip-down piece of glass.  (Perhaps special glass. e.g. beam splitter
However

Any advice or other ideas would be much appreciated.  Has anyone done anything like this previously?  In the spirit of maker culture and for the benefit of everyone I will report all progress on this idea.  All designs will be released to the public.




* My reasoning for this is that a HUD should prevent you from having to refocus your eyes to read information.

I am thinking that part of this is caused simply by use

My current solution is to run a hydraulic rototiller through the sand to ""fluff it"" but this is difficult

So I am seeking insight.  I was thinking about conducting an experiment in a section of one of the playgrounds where we try possible solutions.  the main one i have come up with so far is watering the sand to attempt to wash out the finer grained particles.  I would run a sprinkler maybe twice a week for 15 or so minutes and see of this has any affect.  I was also thinking of pressure washing a 10'x10' section and see if this did anything as well.

Last year I removed all of the sand in one of the playgrounds and replaced with p-gravel.  This helps considerably but it still compact a fair amount and is no where near as nice for the kids to play and build on.  

I was thinking that this forum might have a solution that I am not aware of.  Maybe a chemical that can be sprayed on the sand to lessen friction?  Or the addition to the sand of another material that would lessen the compaction ability (I was thinking the little rubber micro-beads they use in artificial turf).

I've been looking at signals from DC to 2 MHz but there is significant noise all the way up to 100 MHz. Another ""test"" that I've done is shorting the RF spectrum analyzer directly to ground

I've also tested the outlets with a voltmeter and there is between 100 mV and 200 mV between the ground and neutral holes in different outlets throughout the building. I thought this is supposed to be zero? I tested the outlet with an outlet tester from the hardware store and it says it's working fine.

I work in a lab at a University so I have to wait until we can get someone to come out and take a look but any help or other test suggestions would be appreciated.

**EDIT**:

I've done some more tests. I was able to connect wires coming directly out of the wall to our oscilloscope. Here are the time and frequency domain plots:

Different outlets around the lab that lead to different breaker switches in the breaker box contribute to different features in the noise spectrum as well.

1322098597.0,mnec1,The most ridiculous first-year engineering project ever. Any ideas or help is greatly appreciated. ,stven007,31,12,59,"This will be a slightly long read

The general idea of this project is to move items (wooden block, and a 2 dollar coin) from one side of the table to the other.

Simple concept, our TAs, or students from the past. We're basically the guinea pigs for this project, yet the professor is making this worth 25% of our grade.

The link for the project explanation/requirements is [here](https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B3b3sZmmb6FGODRiODc4ZmQtMDYyNy00MjY4LWJiY2MtMjUwMTVkOTBhYzky) (you only need to read pages **2** and **3**)


-----------

TL; DR
If you're too lazy to read through the two pages or click the link

* The items start in a randomized order on top of a cup. 
* There is a barrier about 8 inches high near the middle of the table which cannot be touched. 
* The items must end on top of another cup which is on the other side of the table, then two dollar coin, then dime)
* The wooden block must touch both sides of the table before it ends on top of the cup.
* The dice only needs to touch the second half of the table
* Entire system must be **wind powered**. We are allowed to use a wind turbine that we built from a previous project. I think battery powered systems may be allowed. But seeing as how our budget is $40
* No human intervention except at the very beginning. The human intervention is to essentially start the system. Once the system goes
* System  must complete objectives within 90 seconds. 25% grade reduction if system takes longer than 120 seconds.

My project team is designing a 3 axis linear robot (basically a CNC robot) and we have started selecting lead screws for the 3 axis. I've looked up various lead screw manufacturers but none of them tell you how the end of the lead screw looks like. If we need to mount it say to a bearing or a coupling we need a smooth part at the ends for that. Does anyone know how we can determine this? 

The other thing is that my two other team members are assuming that everything needs to be SUPER precise and accurate or else the lead screw will seize up or the rails will get locked or whatnot. We basically decided that we should be buying most of the critical stuff like rails or actuator assemblies and build as little as possible to reduce the amount of error. So one of our choices is to buy a whole $800 linear assembly for each axis ($2400) which is ridiculous because I doubt the school will pay for that. This would minimize our manufacturing work which I think is bad because it's fun to actually make stuff. 
The other option is to buy the rails and lead screw separately and sort of put them together which would come out to about $1000. This would make it less precise (according to my team) and more prone to error. 

I guess I should mention the application is for a pencil to draw a circle on paper and maybe have the ability to mount a dremel on there. So this is where I need some help. Do we really need $2400 worth of parts to make it run well or can we go with option 2 and make it work fairly easily? I've seen DIY cnc machines online and they work remarkably with minimal price.

Problem: Ventilators and CPAP/BiPap machines cost well into the thousands of dollars. There exist many at-risk patients who cannot afford this or do not have insurance that will cover it.

Method: In theory as far as I can tell a ventilator type device (pumping only air) consists of an air pump, and pressure meter. The critical functions of the device are controlling the valves and pressure limiter based on inputs from the meters as well as an internal timer.

Expected result: A circuit board design and supporting microcontroller software to run the unit which in theory could use any available set of valves

Why? It seems like in a critical situation one could probably build a ventilator for under $1000 before including batteries. Opening the standard would challenge pricing on the basic units. This in turn would free up more patient funds for other features (like buying more batteries) as well as expanding access to critical care devices by allowing for more variety of mechanical components to be used.

I am a civil engineering (geotechnical focus) graduate student. Proficient at simple 2-D drawing in AutoCAD: I used it routinely as a staff engineer when I worked full-time before grad school. I routinely find myself needing to accomplish simple drawing and tasks that I resort to AutoCAD for

AutoCAD is bloated, and does too many things for me to take advantage of. What I'd love is a much simpler solution to gain proficiency in for my limited needs.

I know there are plenty of freeware/shareware/open-source alternatives out there

* Simple line drawing tools: lines, circles, extend, offset, cut, etc. Defining circles and arcs by various geometries (e.g. ""passes through this, tangent to that;"" ""3 points;"" ""1 point and center"" and so on.)

* simple fill tools: hashes and solid fills

* dimensioning tools.

* measurement tools: length, etc.

* a solid set of keyboard shortcuts is a must!

* exporting to vector graphics files would be very nice for including good-quality diagrams in PDF documents by e.g. LaTeX

* The ability to import a raster image in the background. I routinely scan maps and site plans and then draw over them. Useful for producing new engineering drawings and also measuring areas

That's it! That's all I ever use AutoCAD for. Can anyone suggest a simpler program that has all of the above features and few others?

The disadvantages were obvious while working on them:

1.  They require transformers which are pretty expensive, and I bought a really cheap one to verify that was the case. The super cheap transformer did prove that the old one was bad, but it also made a really irritating whine because it was a cheap magnetic transformer. This was eventually replaced with two electronic ones (switchmode, I assume?) which were pretty expensive.

2. Voltage drop
So I should've realized this would happen

Then I split the circuit to install the much quieter electronic transformers and two previously dim fixtures ended up *way* brighter than they had been. Made me realize that the low voltage was causing a huge voltage drop over about 30' of wire, and voltage drop / resistive heating is dependent on current. Low voltages will therefore be much more susceptible than higher voltages, as well as a lot less efficient.

I rewired to reduce the length of the circuit, and now the fixtures are much brighter and fire at the same time.

Does anyone who's done this have stories or advice about your decision and journey to independence. [Side debate: am I crazy for not wanting to be part of company growth],going_it_alone,20,5,5,"
I started working at my current employer right out of school 11 years ago; I had done several work placements in different sectors that lead me to consulting and specifically this firm. Back then it was a small office of 15 - a branch of a much larger firm with the head office in another city. I did a wide range of work from residential retaining walls, say, $1500 to $50,000 in fees.

Since then
What's the problem?

I'm not happy. I like the challenges of coordinating between disciplines and I especially like working with an architect on little design details. The things I like, overtaxed team members (me especially), multiple projects spreading creativity thin. Most of all I loathe office politics. We have grown to the point where the company has decided we won't do residential or insurance work on any level, nor will we work for contractors unless we have a previous relationship with them – the jobs I loved doing.

I chose to work for this company specifically because it was small and did the wide range of work. My love for my work is slowly being eroded away by growth of the company.

So, basically doing the types of small jobs that my current company won't do anymore, mostly working with contractors.

As far as the amount of work out there, comments from building officials in some of the smaller towns surrounding us that no one will service their area, etc. Also, I believe that I could end it well with my firm such that they would pass on work to me they won't do, possibly bringing me on under contract for over flow during high demand periods.

**This leads me to my actual questions:**

* can anyone shed some light on how they went about getting out on their own?
* how were you able to leave it with your former company?
* how can I quantify anecdotal market information (the last paragraph above)?
* better yet is there a way to predict revenue at all?

Bottom line: **can an engineer make a living working by himself**

I'm an upper level PhD student in aerospace engineering working in computational fluid dynamics, both large software packages for HPC and small scripts for automating tasks. I'll argue that strong software engineering skills is completely essential for this (albeit rather specific) field. But I'm admittedly myopic here, so I'm asking for a broader input from industry types.

There is a recent, and chemical engineering departments (possibly less pronounced in EE.) An example would be a department that previously required a two semester series of fortran and matlab with linux and changing this to just a few weeks education of matlab with no compiled languages. Another example is a requirement of a single course in Java, and a suggestion to use matlab without formal training or requirements. As a result of this, it's now commonplace to see incoming first-year graduate students that express an interest in doing numerical simulations that have never compiled a piece of software or seen a nix shell. For academic research, this is definitely a bad thing, and it takes a long time to get them up to speed. Otherwise-capable senior undergraduates ask to do research with our group, but their lack of ability in this area essentially eliminates the potential for them to contribute.


The arguments against teaching programming to freshman engineers I've heard from department chairs are:

* lack of demand for the skills from industry
* students don't like it (definitely the worst reason i've heard)
* difficulty teaching and expense maintaining the required computer resources.
* limited amount of coursework that can be taught in a 4-year curriculum



tldr; industry people

* what industry/occupation are you in?
* how well versed do you want/need fresh BS graduates to be in computer programming? 
* which language(s)? is it preferable to have someone with some experience in both a compiled and scripted language
* if you could redesign the common freshman engineering computing courses

My brother and I like to come up with impossible ideas, but maybe... It is also possibly a really old idea but maybe this could be a novel variation.

Background:

* The closer you get to the sun

* The idea of putting solar mirrors in space to reflect sunlight to solar power plants is  probably old

The idea/variation:

* Given the inverse square law if you put a solar mirror close to the sun you may actually catch a lot of (how much?) sunlight. By converting the diverging light of the sun to a focused beam of parallel light (""giant lazer"") you may be able to transport it back to earth with little loss.

Relevant questions:

- How much light is lost from sun to earth due to divergence and how much is lost due to obstruction or other phenomena?

- How much energy can be acquired per surface area close to the sun? How much can known reflective materials take? Will it be possible to focus and manage a useful amount of light or will the materials brake down? 

Known objections and response(s):

* The solar wind will blow the sail/mirror away. -&gt; It should be possible to adjust position primarily by speed of orbit and secondarily by adjusting the size of the sail.

I was thinking about future fuel regulations today and thinking about how the industry will meet them.  To me it seems there are two ways to make today's style cars meet those regulations - through more efficient engines and hybrid drivetrains and by channeling Colin Chapman who said ""simplify and add lightness.""  

The IC engine has become dramatically more efficient in the past 20 years through better computers, new materials, better FI, etc., so it seems that gains there are going to be incremental.  Hybrid drive trains are certainly a big possibility, especially if a consumer friendly KERS system is developed or battery tech takes off.  Other advances such as electric power steering and low RR tires that actually hold the road can also help with efficiency.

**I'd like to focus this question on ""adding lightness.""**  I am a Lotus fan and that company, most recently though the use of luminum ""tubs"" and chassis.  A nice video is here: [Lotus aluminum bonding](http://green.autoblog.com/2008/01/08/video-lotus-ferrari-tesla-are-using-lightweight-aluminum-in-t/)  In fact, Lotus Engineering has pioneered and licensed a lot of the tech involved ([link](http://www.aluminum.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Home&amp;TEMPLATE=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm&amp;CONTENTID=29336)).  

In terms of ""tubs"" and chassis components,"" making seemingly minor wrecks a total loss.  Carbon fiber is certainly lighter, but costs much more and cannot be manufactured quickly.  Can anyone offer anymore on this topic?

In terms of body panels

Please feel free to discuss any other weight saving or efficiency increasing options on the horizon.

* Could similar techniques be applied to something smaller

Assuming one could make the flow arbitrarily large without flow subsiding, is it theoretically possible to generate enough power quickly enough to get any sort of reasonable payback period? (Not counting how you will move the power to the people it's supplied to?) 

I understand one would have to dig a much deeper canal than the Panama canal

Edit1: Added some spacing to avoid wall'o'text.

Edit2: Did some quick calcs with the info I gave myself...assuming the trench was far enough down to provide each ocean enough flow in and out at a central point (basically you ignore the width of Panama and assume your trench provides adequate flow...I'm sure questionable at best) so creating a hydroelectric dam with undefined flow rate and .2m of head - to generate 1 W of electricity

So to generate 1 MW, we need 425,000,000 Liters per Second of flow.  For reference, all of the oceans on earth contain 1.34 × 10^21 Liters of water.  But we only get to use the top 0.2 meters of the Pacific.  

So the Pacific Ocean has an area of 1.652 x 10^14 meters.  That multiplied by 0.2 meters = 3.304 x 10^16 Liters (converted).  That divided by our L/s calculation gives us 899 days of flow before we RUN OUT OF WATER (not to mention our head is dropping in that time).

* [Here](http://superdoo.net/airsoft1/aeganatomy.jpg) is a basic mock-up of the internals. This is what the electric guns look like internally. 

* [Here](http://aresairsoft.com/for%20web%20only/accessories/Gearbox/l85gearbox.jpg) is a more-detailed version

* And [finally](http://www.iedoutdoor.co.uk/Images/Corte_replica.jpg)

Common points of failure are:

* The seal between cylinder head and the cylinder leak. My idea was make the cylinder and cylinder head one part

* The piston head loses compression over time. My idea was to use metal rings like in car engines to minimize leakage. 

* The teeth on the sector gear (top-most gear that touches the piston) always break. I was thinking make all the gears wider

* The teeth on the piston

The most-common guns, and you just switch it out and your back in the game. New gas guns use a computer to control a solenoid, releasing HPA and propelling the BB forwards. This eliminates the gears, piston, etc. but now you need a remote tank and a line running into the gun, which easily gets caught on sticks and branches when playing in the woods. Using either electricity or gas, how would you improve it?

**Program Status** - I obtained my ME BS in 2011 and immediately enrolled in a PhD program focused on structural dynamics.  However

**Funding** - First year was funded via university PhD fellowship.  This past spring I wrote a proposal for a government-funded grant and was selected to receive the award.  I have guaranteed support for two years that begins next week, and a travel/expense budget.

**Background** - Although I'm an excellent student (GPA: BS 3.9, so my limited success has left me discouraged and without direction since I haven't managed to find a system that keeps me moving forward.  

Although I crave more structure, though I do also enjoy running experiments in the lab for validation.  

To compound matters

The bottom line - I think I may enjoy research as a career, it's difficult to see the value in continuing the PhD, especially if it forces me to put other goals on hold.

***Initial question to /u/Weed_O_Whirler:***

* Could you design an iron man (exoskeleton kind of) realistically? What kind of knowledge goes into that and being an aerospace engineer what would you be able to do to help make it? Are any companies besides Ratheon working on it? It seems that you would have to be good with EE, etc. Sorry for the weird questions, thanks!

***His Response:***

Well

My guess is, would require so much power, and any way we have of producing such power would be so large, it is no longer a suit. Notice in the movie, it relies on an ""arc reactor."" For the power we're talking about here you'd either have to have mastered the mythical cold fusion or perhaps extremely high density batteries. Both of these technologies are being researched, although I'm not sure either of them are being thought about in an Iron Man way.

Secondly- an extremely hard shell is not actually great for protection. What hurts (and kills) a man is extreme acceleration. Putting a man in a very hard suit doesn't really protect him from such accelerations. Helmets always have a hard shell and then a soft interior. The hard shell is to protect the helmet, and would crush a person. Designing suits which reduce the g-forces on a person would allow us to use much higher-impulse fuels, which would greatly reduce the cost of space travel.

I'm sure there are many other things which would have to be worked out, and to really make it ""Iron Man-ish"" you're going to have to have a huge uptick in g-force protection.

Speaking from a ""philosophy of war"" perspective: the government really is moving towards a ""precision"" based weapons systems. There is no army which can stand up to the U.S in an all out war scenario (think WWII)

I'm not sure if I answered what exactly you were asking



***Here are my questions regarding the previous context (Expand on anything you want including the initial question or what he said):***

* What would be the most realistic material for doing this then? 

* Would the person wearing this have to wear a special G force suit and then overlay it with the armor and maybe another overlay of protection (Kevlar maybe)? (In the movies

* It would obviously have to be cooled

* After getting the power source would arming it be the easy part?

* What kind of research would it require to get the power source to be sort of jet pack size or like on the back of NASA suits?

* What UI would be the most realistic one and would that feasible?

TL;DR: Electricity Stock Market

Could improvements to the electrical grid including more advanced monitoring

Would it be possible for every solar panel, it is recognized with a virtual address that can be accessed by the owner through a market interface (much like the more complex broker interfaces used to manage and exchange stocks and other market goods).

It's obviously more complicated than routing signals

The identification could include and route through third-party storage (e.g. a company collects power at peak production and disperses it at peak demand in order to maximize profits for the third-party

The network could have systems in place for emergencies to automatically route power through safe lines to critical locations. I believe this was one of the original goals of smart grid ""self healing""

One of the great barriers to individual ownership of power production is location and installation. You have to have the available land, routing, collection components, inversion components, home modification during installation, inspection, etc.). If systems can be utilized remotely (e.g. producing in a high demand area, but some people don't want it and would utilize alternative sources given the opportunity). Co-ops could be formed anywhere to build capacity in higher demand/production areas with the individual investors able to maintain economic pricing strategies for their portion of the capacity. Areas with high income, but lack either the space, eventually owning a remote capacity of ""green"" technology that is equivalent to or greater than your annual usage). This provides manufacturers of alternative energy equipment the ability to do more economic pricing/bundling/etc. than they could when limited to full system installs and customers in high energy production areas. People like me are a prime example of untapped markets. I'm an engineering student living in an apartment in an Appalachian area of Ohio that has neither reliable solar or wind (without government incentives)

The market system wouldn't necessarily require manual control over power purchase as it could be set to utilize the lowest cost per kilowatt-hour available. This could be disabled when the customer chooses to purchase power from a different supplier. This would appear on both supplier and customer's ends as a system very similar to level 2 market quotes (I wish I had more experience in trading, such as calculated efficiency between source/demand) along with the owner/company registering the individual equipment supply (e.g. residential scale install) or collection/distribution center supply (e.g. investor capacity solar farms), and the specifics of the technology producing it (e.g. whether the residential scale install is solar, wind, etc., or what combination and percent of produced power is provided in a larger distribution service). This way consumers can make informed decisions about their utility purchases. If a consumer doesn't wish to pay the lower price of primary utility supply in favor of power that is ""green"" or is owned by someone they wish to support, then they can put a bid out for a specific source
Passing legislation for green energy would be less of an issue as consumers can vote directly with their funds in the sector of the market they demand instead of trusting the legislative branch to accurately gauge a perception of their demand.

So to give a quick rundown, so ultimately I gave my two weeks notice and left on very good terms.

I decided to take some time off since I never really took a break during college and started working a week after graduation. In that time I basically decided I want to get a masters and now is the best time to do it (no serious financial issues

My biggest problem is I don't know what I want to study. I wanted to work a bit after undergrad to try and narrow that search down and I did but only so much. I'm afraid of picking something that is too specific and then not wanting to work in that field forever. That leads me to a recent thought I've had which is to look into applying for an MBA program

Basically to summarize myself, now on my national fraternity's eboard) but I also have a great passion for creating. Because of the latter, I've always said I wasn't interested in learning econ/business type stuff because I don't want to get stuck with a complete desk job. I ended up with one anyway in my construction engineering job so I have come to some realization that what is more important is work that is interesting. I still though view it in a sense that I want to feel directly responsible for the design of the company's output (whether it be a building, a manufactured product, etc)

So I guess I'm wondering what doors an MBA could lead me to and what it could not. Would going for an MBA along with my BS in Mechanical Engineering leave me with a diverse combination that I could pursue any number of fields with? Or would it set me up for a specific type of work? Are there other options I should consider?
