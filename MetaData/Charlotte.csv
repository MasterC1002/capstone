Please feel free to post suggestions and if you are interested please let me know. Thank you!

Edit 1: I feel like I should add that the date of July 4th may not be the best for everyone and we're still very early in the process of planning this event. So the date is not solid yet.

Edit 2: [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/?sk=welcome#!/events/1383530558525482/) page is up. 

Edit 3 9:28PM: I can already see growing support for a Raleigh rally. If you would like to start a Raleigh rally, please wait before starting a new rally event. Thanks everyone!

Edit 4 9:50pm: I'm starting to upload some helpful documents concerning the laws in Charlotte [here is the link](https://drive.google.com/?authuser=0#folders/0B92WYAng4f_wNk5Na2xEdXI5bEk)

Edit 5 11:16pm: Signing off for the night. Please join the Facebook group if you are planning to attend. If you don't have an account

Edit 6: Good morning everyone! I wanted to add something to Edit 3. It looks like there is plenty of support in Charlotte to justify holding the rally in the Queen City. So that is solid now, its usually around 830pm if I remember correctly. There are also lots of parks nearby where you can grill out and watch some fireworks from. **Here is what we need from all of you:** Tell us the best time frame that will work for you on July 4th. If nothing works, let us know that too. Don't be afraid to bring the conversation over to Facebook, some wall activity will get more people interested that don't follow reddit.

I'm a construction worker in Charlotte

From the outside, a basement, levels 1-3 with offices, and then 4 and 5 which house an old jail.

The courthouse was built in 1898

Everything still works-you'll see a long lever in a cabinet that's used to open various doors on the larger cell block. The small silver buttons select which doors to open and close

The jail itself could house probably about 70 or so people at full capacity. There are larger cells that housed four inmates

The best I can tell, and the sheer logistics of getting tons of steel out of a building likely makes it cost-prohibitive to remove the space. 

If you have any questions

I also share a family connection to this space-at the end of the gallery, I can provide photos of his gravestone at a local churchyard, and the letter recieved from the U.S. Army upon his death.

My grandfather on my Mother's side was a Charlotte city policeman from 1966 to 1975. He likely put a few people away up here.

My husband and I were very unhappy with The Clebourne House, Candace, became increasingly more difficult to work with.  As you can find in other reviews, if you choose to go with people (officiants, caterers, photographers etc) outside of Candace's suggestions, the helpfulness that she is willing to give will decrease quickly.  

She was incredibly rude to our guests, and rude she was when dealing with our ceremony and reception.  She was unorganized and unprofessional both during our year of planning and especially during our wedding day.

Further, and she tore it down before all of our guests were finished eating.  Not only that, but she promised us hot roast beef and gave us cold-cut roast beef from a deli counter.  When we mentioned to her that we had wanted hot roast beef, she denied ever having that conversation with us.

All-in-all, unwanted, and unappreciated on our special day.  When we tried to speak to her about these grievances, she wouldn't discuss any of the real issues we addressed.  She wouldn't even return our emails after she sent a first response email that basically said, ""too bad"".  Bottom line, Candace wants your money, and once she has it

I believe this bill is just as bad as SOPA if not worse. I understand in this day and age our government has to protect its citizens however I strongly feel though that giving up our privacy and liberties to combat this is just wrong and in fact it is giving into the terrorists. What better way could they win? They are defeating our liberties and freedom by scaring our representatives to support bills like this. I voted for you last election but if you support this bill I can assure you that you will not have my vote nor that of many of my friends at my university. Your younger generation does not agree with these draconian laws and as they know CISPA to be. Again

**Edit#2: I believe I have found a home for the Jeep. Merry Christmas
If you'd like to comment below, if you are interested in either, how about PM'ing me?

Here's the deal: 

~~1) I have 4 tickets to the Panthers game and a parking pass~~. I can't go, and free, but in addition to being able to meet me some time tomorrow (I live near uptown) you must 

a) root for the home team

b) generally behave (not get shitface wasted) 

c) include a child or children who never/almost never get to go and would be thrilled as part of an early Xmas, 

d) promise on those children's lives that you will go (and not sell them)

e) think about some nice thing to ""pay this forward""--I really don't care what

~~**Idea #2: I have a used ""Power Wheels Jeep Hurricane two seater""**~~ [picture of jeep hurricane]( http://trus.imageg.net/graphics/media/trus/Aplusplus/2011/2310848/Fisher-Price-Power-Wheels-Jeep-Hurricane-with-Monster-Traction-2310848-01.jpg) that I am retiring from my kids' toys. It also is free. The best ages for these are probably 3-5

a) you are at least semi-handy. I will show you the one problem I have had with it (has to do w/ the gears/axle) and show you my fix

b) you can afford a new battery charger (and at some point, near the Power Wheels. They ain't cheap, but since the toy itself is like $400ish new, spending $40 on a charger is a cheap way (note: a small charger w/ alligator clips may work, but I don't know)

c) This must be for your child(ren)

d) pay it forward in some way. I don't care, or call that family member you've been estranged from and tell them you're sorry (even if they should be the ones saying they're sorry. Just do something nice.

- I watched the Charlotte Knights take on the Atlanta team
- Went to a local Comedy Club
- Bowled in a pretty cool lounge alley 
- Visited an REI in person for the first time and wanted to max out my credit card
- Ran the Blue Points 5K by the football stadium
- Checked out the NASCAR hall of fame (I'm sure it's a big deal to anyone who like NASCAR but I was lost)

I am currently looking for work in the Charlotte area and know that I'm not the only one. I currently work with *zero* redditors and that needs to change. Monster

Here is how I imagine this works. If you're looking for work leave a comment of what field you are looking for. Then briefly list with bullet points some of the experiences/skills you have. Hopefully a fellow redditor will read your comment and give you a lead. Best case scenario: You get a job. Worst case scenario: You get the satisfaction of trying. Tips about leads even from people not job searching would be appreciated.

**Job Search Example from JohnQRedditor:**

     I am looking for a new job related to my passion of redditing. Explanation etcetera...

     Field: Professional Redditor
     Experience: 
     * Skill #1 - Posting OC to various subreddits
     * Skill #2 - Karma delegation to comments
     * Skill #3 - Mod of several niche reddits
     * Skill #4 - Professional bacon eating
     &gt;&gt;LinkedIn Profile Link Here&lt;&lt;

     

**Job Example from AwesomBoss5000:**

     
     We've been looking for a person to professionally mod our corporate subreddits with skill and accuracy. 
     It would also be nice if we had someone to generate some OC every now and then. 
     Must love bacon.



Let's get some /r/Charlotte people hired. Go to it.

Amelie's: I basically live there. I mean, even if you've never been there. Chocolate, soup, baguettes, whatever. Eat this shit now.

The Liberty: Not exactly a ""best kept secret"" sort of place, and they'll pair beer to food.

LuLu: In the month or so I've been reading r/Charlotte, cozy atmosphere. Decent price for the level of cuisine. Heard good things about brunch, never had it. Seasonal menu. Duck and smoked eggplant lasagna are great.

Hickory House: Hickory House? What's that? Never heard of it? Bitches, and it's a windowless box. Seriously. No windows. It's also fucking OLD. The decor is literally various wood cutting implements, and small cover wagons over the wall sconces. But who fucking cares, there's a fireplace the size of a Volkswagen dumping delicious hickory smell into your nose and onto the fabulous meat. Fucking god, all the time I wasted at Mac's.

Speaking of old ass dives, so small they use a semi-trailer to store things. Won best ""old school"" burger in Charlotte. Elusive for 2 reasons: only open from 7 - 2 on weekdays, and only takes cash. Seriously, I lived across the street from it for 3 years and only ate there twice during that time.

Dim Sum: On Central. Good, fabulous Dim Sum on Sundays. For the uninitiated, Dim Sum is like Chinese Tapas that comes on a steamer cart and you eat until you either shit your pants or start to hallucinate.

Lang Van: Last one, fast, cheap. Great pho. After going there, I found out that more than half of my coworkers went there regularly... they just assumed I knew. Try the iced coffee, it gives me an erection just thinking about it.",,False,t5_2qo2j,True

Use Zillow. It is your friend.

Keep Charlotte Boring, the name was chosen ironically.  We actually don't want to keep Charlotte boring at all; we just thought it sounded catchy.  In a nutshell, this is who we are:

We're heavily focused on people and smaller businesses, especially in a busy, growing city like Charlotte.  Essentially, we want to remind people that those connections are still there, and behind all of the goods and services we provide, we're all humans that rely on each other.

We have a style that you would be likely to see from Creative Loafing

We're working day and night to get our website live, we're doing almost all of our work out of our Facebook page, and as I've just received access to the KCB Twitter account, that'll be underway soon.

I'm very thankful to have received mod approval to get on my little soapbox here.  If anyone is interested in what we stand for, like us at http://www.facebook.com/keepcharlotteboring.  If you want to ask me a question, comment on what we're doing, or want to suggest a place we should check out, let me know!  I'm available through here, PM, or you can follow us at the Twitter name @keepcltboring.

Thanks for your time

*Edited for typo corrections.

*Edit 2:  We want to talk to ents and get everything straightened out. For now, but we may be making some changes if necessary. We've also taken your suggestions into consideration, so we'd like to say 'thank you' for providing us with feedback. We will continue to update as new information is available. Again, thanks for everyone's feedback, and for your understanding. --hirnrissig",,False,t5_2qo2j,True

I'm talking about starting with games like Settlers of Catan or Carcassonne* but more (as per footnote) Ticket to Ride, or (shudder) Small World. If it catches on, obviously we can mix it up into some heavier territory. Of course, folks already into gaming are welcome as well (and less to teach!).

Most likely, so that sort of limits the size of the group (I'd like to play and not just showrun, of course). Some options I've explored are the Caribou Coffee on Park Road, as they're not often busy and have a big room to use. Only thing is you need to pay $35 per hour (on coffee and pastries and such), and for smaller turnouts that may be hard to meet. For smaller groups (say, up to six) we'd be cool hosting, if you're cool coming by. Prior game night was on Tuesday, but weekends would be cool also if it catches and we've got some folks interested in marathon sessions.

There is a girl who manages it during the day (I think her parents own the franchise) who is totally on it from the customer service to running the place.

I've been reading all of the threads on /r/Charlotte regarding moving and one theme that seems to occur often is the anti-hipster comments.  Let me first start by saying that I, Bushwick, etc...) because at times I do find their attitude annoying (especially the ""hipsters"" who are living off of their parents money).  I do, however, find myself multiple times/week hanging out in ""hipster"" neighborhoods because they have the best food, best dive bars, best coffee and generally the best entertainment (IMO).

To me - real ""hipsters"" are snobby in all the right areas, cheap beer in dives or really good beer that doesn't cost $9/pint - also the types of bars - they have Barcade (a bar with 25 cent old school standup arcade games), Skeeball bars, a movie theater with food/booze, the best shows, free personal pizza with purchase of beer (Alligator Lounge), a cool old bowling alley with a great bar

I liken the ""hipster"" to the bee. If you have a large garden, but without them, your garden would be more difficult to sustain and may not produce as high a quality of fruit/veggie/flower.

So - here's my question: Am I reading too far into certain comments from people on the internet just ranting about whatever comes to mind

1371486073.0,1giu2g,Hello /r/Charlotte! I'm looking for a Carolina BBQ recommendation.,bunka77,12,1,62,"I'm in town from Kansas City

I can get all the tomato based sauce I need in KC so I'm not really looking for that style, I feel it's superior.  KC BBQ is best BBQ.)  This week though, I want to try something new.

**EDIT: Kickin' Pig** 

Okay, but I'll share my thoughts anyway.  We had copped pork, chicken, ribs (they were gone by the time I got down there) wings, baked beans, and *cole*slaw.  In fact there were two different types of *cole*slaw, but I'm not a big fan

**Chopped Pork**-  I think this was eastern Carolina style as I didn't see or taste any mustard Carolina Gold sauce.  When I first saw it, because it wasn't greasy at all.  It was cold (not their fault) but it was still good, and very moist.  It was difficult to suppress my instinct to pour ""sweet ketchup"" all over it, but I didn't.  All things considered, I enjoyed it.  Especially how moist it was.

**chicken wing**  These I did pour some ""sweet ketchup"" all over, and unlike the pork, it wasn't nearly as moist, but I'll chalk that up to it being cold...

**BBQ Baked Beans**  These kind of surprised me.  They were different than any baked beans I've had before.  I noticed they were sweeter, too, and I was surprised that even sides were done differently here.  I'm sure there was more difference in the recipe than just sliced onions and black beans, but they really did taste a lot different than the beans we have in KC.  I don't think they were cooked as long, b/c the beans weren't mushy (like ours are) and the color wasn't quite as homogenized.  I also think we might add more pepper to our beans.  Anyway, I know this is about BBQ, and I just spent more time reviewing the baked beans

**EDIT 2: 521 BBQ**

I just want to start by saying thanks to /r/charlotte for the responses, hush puppies and *cole*slaw (which I substituted out for onion rings, and I added a large chopped pork sandwich)](http://i.imgur.com/nwGkNDy.jpg).  I has very nerves all day about the vinegar BBQ sauce.  I wanted to keep an open minding, but I just couldn't imagine that I would like it.  When I got to 521 BBQ, and smelled the smoke, my fears subsided.  That is, until I got to the counter.  I asked for the rib plate, I asked if I could order on the long or short end.  She said, so I smiled and said I would also like the large chopped pork sandwich.

**Vinegar sauce**  I was really worried I was going to hate this... I put a little on my ""sandwich"" (I didn't eat any of the bun, then finished with the spices in the sauce.

**Mustard sauce**  This is the one I was really excited to try, serves a [world famous sauce](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_EEr7HJsBacI/RiN6DtXgINI/AAAAAAAAAr8/tKDd7q1NzMA/s320/Bryant+and+St+Peter.gif) which is technically vinegar based, but tastes pretty thick and mustard-y.  (KC's tomato based sauce tradition follows Ollie Gate's recipe from the *other* ""original"" KC BBQ join [Gate's BBQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6CWOsRXee0&amp;t=45).)  Anyway, I put the mustard sauce on the rest of my chopped pork, and it was really good, too.  I still like my tomato based sauce, but I think I might have to order in some of your Carolina gold sauce when I get the cravings.

**Ribs** I'm going to start off saying I liked the ribs.  They were good ribs.  They had a thick pink smoke ring, they were moist, the rub was great, and I detected a bit of sauce that was dabbed on in the last hour or smoking which mixed with the meats sweat and caramelized nicely around the outside.  I'll put them against any other rack of ribs I've eaten.  I want to get that out of the way, because I have some criticism, too.  For starters, they were very tender- but like *too* tender.  I wish they would have given up *just a bit* more fight coming off the bone (if ""the meat was *too* tender"" isn't a first world problem

The other issue I had was a bit more disconcerting, which took parts of the deliciously caramelized sauce and charred it.  Every rib had a good bite and a half where I couldn't really get over the taste of burnt meat...  I think the whole thing would have been better if they just never made their way to the grill, and I got them right out of the pit.  Is that typical here?  Did they maybe just accidentally leave my rack on the grill a tad too long?  Again the ribs were good, but I just didn't understand the decision to grill them.

**Sides**  Really uneventful, not really a deal breaker.

~~Problem: The Humane Society's vet passed on him because of a lazy eye.  One that was thoroughly checked out by my vet and might simply go away on its own.  Justification was that they're too short on resources to take dogs with something wrong with them.~~

I work with the Austin, heading through the Charlotte area on or around October 22nd on their way back from playing CMJ Fest up in NYC. (Dates are actually flexible if you've got something in mind...)

This band has harmonies that will make you weep, whether it's a house party, as an opening act, or for a private event. The band isn't looking for a guarantee, a cut of the door, or anything like that - just a chance to get in front of new audiences and hopefully sell some merchandise.

It's a great group that has already been a featured performer at SXSW, with many new tracks appearing on tour this coming month.

1350253848.0,11hbwj,Simply Charlotte stargazing ,ActuallyYeah,17,5,8,"Hey Charlotte
With a new moon staying out of the night sky and this brisk fall air slaying the urban haze, I'll take on the huge issues of viewing locations and urban light pollution in the next update.

UP ALL NIGHT?
Hanging out in the northeast at evening's start is the bright five-star ""W"" of queen Cassiopeia. If you were to stay up from 8 pm to 5 am

EARLY ON
Sunset's at 6:49. Good stargazing begins about an hour after. Straight overhead and bright will be the spindly cross of Cygnus, four-star ""T"" forms the back of Cygnus's body. The brightest star is Deneb, at the swan's tail.
Skirting the northern horizon early in the evening will be Ursa Major (the Big Dipper). Above it lies Ursa Minor, and the two stars at the end of its small box-shaped dipper are the easiest to see. Between Ursa Minor and Cygnus lie the diamond-shaped head of Draco, as well as the bright white star Vega in its tiny constellation of Lyra.
If you're somewhere with a particularly clear shot of the southwest horizon, broad jumble of Sagittarius. 

NIGHT OWLS ONLY
By 11:00
Orion and Gemini rise after and below Taurus by 1 or 1:30. By wintertime, the most luminous star you'll ever see, rises in the SE around 2:30.
By 5 am, rises from the due-eastern horizon. Ursa Major will be making an encore, rising north of Venus. At 6:30, the night's over. Gotta watch blue skies for the next twelve hours...

The skies will be shifting as the year ticks by. I'll keep you updated. Feel free to PM me more information about astronomy or night skies.",,t5_2qo2j,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Charlotte/comments/11hbwj/simply_charlotte_stargazing/

*(I have Read every thread on the subject about moving and apartments on r/Charlotte and r/charlottenc need some more info if you don't mind)* Pardon my naive questions.

** Our personal circumstances** 

My wife and I will likely be moving to your nice looking town in the next month, I'm the second Wisconsin expat on this subreddit) she just got offered a job as a teacher just to the north east of ""uptown"" (I think is the nomenclature, it is outside of the loop/beltline (Is there a local name for the 277/77 loop around the uptown (Also do you really not call it a downtown?) but only by a few minutes. We realize the schools are a bit rough in CMS but strongly feel every kid deserves a good education and have no regrets about that. I am an IT/Network tech who can perform my current job anywhere in the world with internet, but will look into picking up more clients in NC, no rush though. *(Personal Advertisement: Need VPNs Firewalls, Networking, open source solutions like content filters, internet usage narcs (facebook blockers)

Your apartment/townhouse/rental house market is overwhelming and crazy


**Where should we live? Where should we avoid.** Also

We are shopping in the ~900-1400 for a one bedroom, steel appliances, and stylish dark wood cabinets, even if it is all a laminate from ikea.

We are both young, and want to have fun. We are foodies from Wisconsin so we love drinking and dining, and being able to walk to those venues would be great. (We are not a fan of the dive bar crowd, quality microbrews and good fresh healthful quality food is what we like) We like live music, shows, parks, walking, etc. I see lots of very nice quaint looking houses for great prices but I am worried they are too far from the action.

We loved the ""walkable and urban"" feel of Madison WI

Relative safety would be good, violent crime however is a definite downer.

**Other questions:** 

* Does Virgin Mobile have good 3G service there? (They show up good on their maps

* Real estate companies to avoid? Anyone you would recommend

* Good websites to shop for apartments in your area? (Using Craigslist and Zillow at the moment)

* Hypothetically if we lived uptown and my wife had to take a 15 minute bus-ride northeast because we had one car

* How hard are the emissions inspections to pass? I have a 92 oldsmobile that is rusted around the everything, its a death trap) but I wouldn't want to stick a bunch of money catalytic converters and whatnot.

* Is Time Warner available throughout most of the city? We have great luck with them here

* Here we have a great grocery store that is the size of multiple Walmart super centers selling every food imaginable at great prices here

* Am I going to be able to find fresh mozzarella, young asiago, 10 year cheddar, etc etc etc, Our liquor stores have several hundred if not thousand micro-brews for sale will I be disappointed? (Yes every Wisconsin stereotype is 100% accurate, actually the reality is probably even worse than the stereotype.) 

You city seriously looks very impressive on google's street view, and rotting from the inside out, our downtown's are littered with abandoned storefronts, 20 year dead malls, and industrial buildings, etc. You have a thriving subreddit of what seems to be incredibly helpful and happy people (/r/greenbay is filled with depressed people who all use the caveat, yes I reluctantly live in green bay, and coming to visit for perhaps quite a while. **Thanks for your time!**
