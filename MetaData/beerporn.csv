We arrived in Brussels in the morning

[Mash](http://i.imgur.com/ZuEmM.jpg) [Tun](http://i.imgur.com/Mv3RS.jpg) on the first floor.

The [kettle and grain mill](http://i.imgur.com/Pp9KD.jpg) are on the second floor.

Wort is pumped from the kettle up to the top floor [coolship](http://i.imgur.com/58YmR.jpg)

It's moved the next day down the the 3rd floor into the [primary fermenter](http://i.imgur.com/PKsUq.jpg) for several days.

Then it goes into [barrels](http://i.imgur.com/XQ5rT.jpg).  For a [long time](http://i.imgur.com/asd0F.jpg) (Time does not respect what is done without him).  They can be [messy](http://i.imgur.com/5VmXP.jpg).  Eventually they're [blended for packaging](http://i.imgur.com/upWcd.jpg).  So many [bottles](http://imgur.com/AVM5A).

Finally we drink ([Rose de Gambrinus and Gueuze](http://i.imgur.com/LZw17.jpg) plus unpictured kriek and unblended lambic).  I talked to the brewer and his sister a little and she shows me the [clay fermenting pots](http://i.imgur.com/Pcg5N.jpg) that were in the non-tour area.

Finally we can go to our hotel and then over to [Moeder Lambic](http://i.imgur.com/mCfB1.jpg).  Start off with some [Saison Dupont Dry Hopping](http://i.imgur.com/KtsvH.jpg).  Then a [glorious meat and cheese plate](http://i.imgur.com/nfuyg.jpg) to go with some more Rose de Gambrinus and 
De la Senne Zinnebir.  Rounded it out with Adelardus Triple, De la Senne Jambe Dambe de Bois, and De la Senne Taras Boulba.  Good first day.

The next morning we took a train to [Antwerp](http://i.imgur.com/zZAs9.jpg).  First night was at [Kulminator](http://i.imgur.com/slLw8.jpg).  We decided to start things off with some [Struise Kabert](http://i.imgur.com/hplBM.jpg) (blend of Black Albert and Kate the Great aged in Port Barrels) and [2007 Boon Mariage Parfait](http://i.imgur.com/bg9wT.jpg).  The [list](http://i.imgur.com/93LcA.jpg) was nuts.  I asked the owner for a gueuze recommendation and he said [Horal's Oude Gueze Megablend](http://i.imgur.com/TlH0e.jpg) was the best he had.  Then some [1979 Westvleteren Prior](http://i.imgur.com/m7Jfr.jpg).  It held up surprisingly well so I decided to try the [1979 Westvleteren Abt 12](http://i.imgur.com/q6G21.jpg) and compare it to a fresh one.  All 3 [bottles](http://i.imgur.com/QYUoR.jpg).  Had to get the [last drop](http://i.imgur.com/dBNyE.jpg).  The tried some [Mort Subite Oude Gueuze](http://i.imgur.com/kiI9m.jpg).  And some [2000 Kwelchouffe](http://i.imgur.com/gM01P.jpg) from a neighboring table we made friends with.  Not pictured: 1992 Chimay Blue (didn't hold up nearly as well as the old Westy)

Next day was at [Antwaerps Bierhuiske](http://i.imgur.com/yuDpA.jpg).  [Pannepot was on tap](http://i.imgur.com/xtwCm.jpg) and Leslie wanted some Drie Fonteinen Oude Gueuze.  Then [De Cam Oude Gueuze](http://i.imgur.com/br6QG.jpg).  I've never seen a cork shoot out as soon as the cage is loosened

Took a train to [Paris](http://i.imgur.com/g0VVO.jpg) the next morning.  Here's another [cool picture](http://i.imgur.com/ibHVu.jpg) or [two](http://i.imgur.com/Bty0e.jpg).  Beer in Paris sucks so at the local ""beer bar"" I decided to try this French beer thing called [Piconbier](http://i.imgur.com/8rOJD.jpg)

It was good to head back to Belgium where our first stop was [3 Fonteinen](http://i.imgur.com/etxnF.jpg).  [We had](http://i.imgur.com/wGHNN.jpg) the Kriek and Lambic on tap and I had to try the Armand 'Spirit (more like vodka than anything.  Disappointingly the kriek on tap was sweetened.

Then a little firther outside Brussels to the great beer bar [De Heeren van Liederkercke](http://i.imgur.com/3lW9C.jpg).  We started with 3 Fonteinen [Armand'4 Oude Geuze Lente](http://i.imgur.com/yTLKp.jpg).  Their house beer, but De Troch had just kicked so our server gave us a Girardin Kriek as the 4th.  We stayed in the [guest house](http://i.imgur.com/obrAi.jpg) out back and they gave us a bottle of their very good house dark beer, [Boelens Heerenbier](http://i.imgur.com/MYzj1.jpg), to drink in our room.

The next day we headed down to the Ardennes to visit Fantome in Soy.  I had arranged to meet with Dany that afternoon.  [Showed up](http://i.imgur.com/FUd99.jpg) and nobody there.  We checked back that night and the next morning with no luck.  At least we found the one place in Belgium (in the next town over

The next day we left for Westvleteren [my favorite Blond](http://i.imgur.com/yPW0Y.jpg) (and got some bottles to go).

Then headed across town to the [Struise](http://i.imgur.com/X8x7i.jpg) [Old](http://i.imgur.com/Be6gj.jpg) [Schoolhouse](http://i.imgur.com/X1nis.jpg).  They had about 25 beers on tap.  First we tried [Pannepot Wild and Lion Claws](http://i.imgur.com/OirxD.jpg) (Hair of the Dog Collaboration).  After that we were mainly just talking to Urbain and David so I didn't get pictures of Five Squared

Then off to [De Dolle](http://i.imgur.com/eSgVk.jpg) for some [Oerbier

Got to [Bruges](http://i.imgur.com/sUjQI.jpg) that later that night.  First stop was at the [Struise shop](http://i.imgur.com/wzESK.jpg) (sorry no good picture, and Single Black.  Then we headed to De Garre (down a [crazy small alley](http://i.imgur.com/Ry3uW.jpg)) for their very nice [house tripel](http://i.imgur.com/GjeHl.jpg), made by Van Steenberge.  That was also possibly the best cheese of the whole trip.  David at Struise told us we should go to [Cafe Rose Red](http://i.imgur.com/h2HZ9.jpg) for somewhere chill, so that was our next stop.  We started with [De Troch Cuvee Chapeau Oude Gueuze and Tournay Noire](http://i.imgur.com/qf02F.jpg).  Then some [Dupont Cervasia](http://i.imgur.com/RZsAK.jpg), which was very nice, [Hopus Blond](http://i.imgur.com/ztPgG.jpg), [De Leite Enfant Terriple](http://i.imgur.com/cbTPU.jpg)

The next day we had lunch at Cambrinus where I tried a [Caulier Myrtille](http://i.imgur.com/ESSHE.jpg).

We later ended up at ['t Brugs Beertje](http://i.imgur.com/r2Cej.jpg).  Started with [Cuvee de Ranke](http://i.imgur.com/LXhUi.jpg) then decided to go Trappist with [Westmalle Tripel and Achel Blond](http://i.imgur.com/0Xqlr.jpg).  The Westmalle was far better.  Finished was [Prearis Quadrupel and another Rose de Gambrinus](http://i.imgur.com/hZu6C.jpg).

Next stop was the awesome, [Dupont Moinette Blond, and Van Honsebrouck Brigand](http://i.imgur.com/iRXfl.jpg).

Back to Brussels the next day where we hit Cantillon again for some [Iris](http://i.imgur.com/wiN7j.jpg).  Later that day we hit Poechenellekelder for some [Cantillon Zwanze](http://i.imgur.com/vw2NP.jpg).

Last stop was back to Moeder Lambic.  They were having an Italian beer festival so we tried a few Italian beers.  [Toccalmat'to Zona Cesarini](http://i.imgur.com/gKxJr.jpg) was a good Vermont style IPA.  [Elav Grunge and Extraomnes Saison](http://i.imgur.com/KLYCn.jpg) weren't as good, and [Tilquin Gueuze](http://i.imgur.com/Itk8T.jpg) to end it.

Made it home with a few [bottles](http://i.imgur.com/mkhWm.jpg) and [glasses](http://i.imgur.com/BUeeJ.jpg).",self,t5_2rf7v,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/beerporn/comments/uryb7/my_belgium_trip/
