Thought it was funny.

Queued up today and copy+pasted my usual, jungle, mid, top based on what's available at my turn.""

The 5th pick person already called adc. They did not like my statement and told me I would be support.

Now I am a reasonable fellow. My standard policy is to see if someone like this is better than me at their preferred role and give them the pick if I see that they are. I looked them up... Bronze V... grossly negative w/l record

Trying to be encouraging I said, and did great.) Truth is I'd rather have 2 ADC bot than support some of the really bad ones I've seen.

It was beginning to get ugly as the 2nd pick was getting riled up, pretending to get offended because I said 'he' and she's a 'she' whatever.

Then 1st pick spoke up and said he would be adc. ""Good

2nd pick Rumble. Looked him up. Awesome Rumble player for Bronze III or whatever.

My pick

4th pick

5th pick... silence... waiting...

""You're jungle

Locks in Nasus.

Great. Got through that.

Now here's when it happens-- all the sudden that Nasus turns into MF! 
And 1st pick's MF turns into Nasus!

Shocking.

1369007365.0,1entg6,[STORY] A Bronze (IV) Success.,Boukish,58,6,10,"I don't really know if /r/bestofbronze is the place for successful bronze stories

To give some backstory, relatively speaking (few months), and hadn't really figured out what I was objectively good at, only what I liked to do. Long story short, a combination of queue dodging obvious trolls (I figure it didn't hurt my MMR, and if I deserved to climb I would regardless of LP loss), an unlucky string of AFK teammates, I quickly tank to Bronze IV in under 30 ranked games played. I'd mostly been avoiding ranked since it seemed every time I played there would be something catastrophic like a mid or feed or an afk or a support that wouldn't support (as in, then blames you for the jungler gank), which meant subsequent times in ranked wouldn't end well which kept the cycle going.

Anyway, hard carry (14/5 Cait), gg. Next game I get Singed top, hard carry (6/0), gg. I now qualify for my promo series into Bronze III, so I'm pretty stoked. I queue up, and I'm first pick. Fifth pick immediately says ""top"" as the game loads, I pick my Singed first

This happens four times in a row. Every time, picks in the same order. The fifth pick declares that he will top, and I clarify that I will be topping as first pick, all four times. Except this fourth time, I made the mistake of banning Twisted Fate because I saw the opponent on the other team first pick TF. So, you know what, he bans my Singed.
I freeze, and fifth pick finally gets to choose. Given everyone else's picks, he is stuck with supporting. He picks Akali.

The chat immediately erupts into WTFs and shit, let's all cool our jets. So our jungler (who had picked Sejuani) was like fine, I'll support. Myself having no idea how to jungle Riven and not being very interested in learning on the fly, I type these words into chat:

""Fuck it

Akali immediately says ""okay

We get into game, and we immediately get him down to about 20% health. Now Akali's only job is to zone Warwick out from CS while I farm up. Sure enough, the lane pushes all the way to his turret and Warwick's getting some CS now. And, unfortunately, his jungler (Trundle) has now made this an outright 2v2 lane.

We poke around for a bit

""Dive?""

I didn't hesitate. I'm not even sure what buttons I pressed, Akali still hadn't backed, but both of our full health lane opponents were back and zoning us from creep. But doing my best BRNA impression, I outtrade both of them and get them low enough for Akali to pick up another double kill, but we both died in the process. Now we're both six, and queue another tower dive. Akali has like 7 CS but 7 kills (she had roamed), but Warwick only has about 16. I'm sitting pretty on a brutalizer and a decent amount of CS relative to the aggression in the lane. This tower dive, so now it's time for us to roam. We roam mid, get Akali a triple kill

Meanwhile, and was outright pissed we just let Trundle get our towers for free. She keeps asking us to group while our roaming ganks are working very effectively, so in spite of her I just roam around pushing objectives down (3 solo dragons and 5 turrets mostly solo) while Akali causes havoc all around the map. Every time I show up for a fight, I just e in, stun a couple people, die and watch Akali and the rest of my team pick up kills. The game pretty much devolved into a call of duty match while I'm trying my hardest to dutifully ignore everything that doesn't give global gold. And boy was it working. My team was cleaning up 4v5 and people were listening to my calls despite me playing pretty badly and rarely showing up for the action. We won the 30 minute game pretty hard.

**TL;DR My 16/11/14 Akali support carried me (6/8/10) and my lane opponent's support brought smite. First promo game: success.**

Because i kept restocking on wards

At one point i was 3/0/4, so it was me staring down the enemy Rumble and trading small hits.

I ended out going to 4/0/7, when our jungler was pursuing him. I got chewed out for that.

I then proceeded to die a lot setting up kills, we ended out winning quite comfortably, with the 2 other players who did most the hurt not saying anything, the enemy team complaining that ""thresh hook op"" and MF and Shaco claiming i'm a bad support.

I'll start off by throwing a picture of what champion select is at the lowest of silver and the generally throughout in Bronze. We ended up winning this game so I don't wanna name and shame the guy who wanted to troll.

[Champion Select](http://oi37.tinypic.com/2wgxi09.jpg)

**Elo Hell Story**


And I will finish off by a story and some harrasment I received from a duoq who was Bronze 3 and 1

The game started and the duoq partners went for the carry roles as mid and ad carry

Then I as a friendly support tried to save him resulting in me dying a couple of times and then they used that as evidence to make me into the black sheep of the game and wanted everybody to report me.
I was a bit immature as well so I started trying to reason with them in a more angry manner than what I usually do

Memorable quotes from my laning partner after the match was over:
&gt; ***: report what waht doing DMG noob

&gt; ***: i dont feed like u. u died 7 times

&gt; ***: u fk NOOB

&gt; ***: yes feeding. to sabotage. u never warded

&gt; ***: where are u from? spaion?´


**tl;dr I became the feeder for trying to peel for Varus when we engaged and most likely also reported by multiple parts of both team**

PS: Didn't post the whole post game chat since I suck at formatting in Reddit

/EDIT

Both the guys still seems to be Bronze and have given up on doing ranked altogether.

The enemy team consisted of a Yi (jungle), and an Ashe with a support Swain. Swain never connected. So bot lane was going to be an easy win, right? 2v1, kill lane champs with escapes, and a ganking king jungler. 

Well, then Ashe and Yi would jump him when he wasn't paying attention. He was diving every chance he had, and dying for it, and I'm the bad player because I wouldn't chase. I told him we couldn't tank the tower, we needed to farm. He called our team noobs for not calling MIA on jungle Yi. I had tribush, river bush and dragon *all* warded, he had no excuse other than poor awareness. I was also pinging when I saw Yi. Fast forward to 10 minutes in and Graves has died 3 times to Ashe. Nid was holding her own, come to find out this was their first time playing Kayle. Zac farmed the jungle

Well, but since Graves kept dying, I wasn't getting assist gold, and thus was item starved. Zed and Kat focused me, destroying me, while Zac stayed in our jungle, just farming. He was farming still when they took two inhibs at 30 mins.

I wound up unintentionally feeding. Not because of myself playing poorly

We lost the game at 34 mins. We lost a 5v4 because of a carry who got cocky and a top lane champ who never played their champ before. I learned at that point

My only request is you play champions you know and play your best role. Go back to blind and draft if you want to learn.

Bot lane starts... not so well. 2 kills given to their AD carry in the first 3 minutes. 5th minute, and I die 3 times and get 2 kills. We then have a team fight at about 18 minutes. Nobody (somehow) really wins or loses. It just sort of ends up evenly. Everyone goes back to csing for a while, and their team decides to push mid. They get all the way to our inhibitor, before we engage, and win the fight. We kill 2 of their mid towers, and go back to defending. We then have a massive throw, and lose 3 team fights in a row. The last team fight, and push to their inhib. We start winning team fights, and I think it's over. We manage to push them back, and we go all in on him. The team fight starts
