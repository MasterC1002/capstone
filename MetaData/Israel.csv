1353929132.0,13t3xf,Palestinian here: I wish one day the Arab world gets as little as 10% of the criticism Israel gets for atrocities committed towards Palestinians.,throwaway874832749,490,155,116,"Considering the success of my last [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/13chp2/palestinian_here_hear_me_out_youll_probably_like/)

Let me start with a couple of countries:

**Lebanon**

Around half of the 400, no access to the Lebanese healthcare system and there are certain restrictions on jobs we are allowed to do. We are issued handwritten [travel documents](www.passport-collector.com/2011/08/10/lebanon-refugee-passport-for-palestine/) of appalling quality (large size, cheap paper). The travel documents don't even have a full date of birth, just the birth year. You probably know about the Sabra and Chatila massacre (from the movie Waltz with Bashir, perhaps my favorite animated movie) were 3000 Palestinian civilians were killed in cold blood. These are at the top of my head, I'm sure there's more. This is what a British MP Gerald Kaufman said in 2011 when he visited the camps:

&gt;When I went to Gaza in 2010 I thought I had seen the worst that could be seen of the appalling predicament of Palestinians living in conditions which no human being should be expected to endure. But what I saw in the camps in Lebanon is far worse and far more hopeless. The conditions are unspeakable, tomorrow and for a future that cannot even be foreseen. At least in Gaza, frightful though the situation is, the people are free within the confines of their blockaded prison. In the camps of Lebanon they are not free.

**Syria**

Surprisingly

**Jordan**

It's the only country that naturalized Palestinians after the annexation of the West Bank, but it's minimal compared to other Arab countries.

**Kuwait**

Kuwait [expelled](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_expulsion_from_Kuwait) more than 450

**Iraq**

Palestinians enjoyed full rights under Saddam's reign

**Egypt**

You can read [this](http://www.fmreview.org/sites/fmr/files/FMRdownloads/en/FMRpdfs/FMR20/FMR2013.pdf) report here. Not only are they discriminated against (no free education) but they receive no UN assistance whatsoever. If they go out of the country for more than 6 months, one observer (a member of UN) noted that ""For all practical purposes it would be true to say that for the last six years in Gaza over 300,000 poverty stricken people have been physically confined to an area the size of a large city park.""

-----------

I'm sure there's more but these are off the top of my head. Also

Moral of the story: Israel naturalized over 1.5 million Palestinians. They enjoy full citizen rights and many of them would remain in Israel even if a Palestinian state is established. Palestinians in the Arab world on the other hand suffer from discernible and vile discrimination. If a non-Palestinian Arab speaks of the maltreatment of Palestinians by Israelis

Silliness aside though
(1) I'll preface the question by saying that I personally don't think a two-state solution would work. I won't get into the details of my opinion since it's beside the point, assuming they were willing to co-habit with Israelis peacefully as neighbors and co-workers, do you think Israeli society would embrace them? Or would the majority of Israeli society want Palestinians separate from them in their own areas frequenting their own establishments?  
  
(2) I was also wondering if any of you knew of a good book that attempts to be unbiased and narrates the history of the Israeli-Palestinian lands over the centuries. Sadly
  
Thanks guys. If you've got any questions for me I'd be happy to answer.

Anyways, but had they known the suffering Gazans had to endure, they probably wouldn't have voted for hamas. Besides, it's not like Hamas benefited Palestinians in any way in the past years. Israel initiated the blockade on Gaza, Hamas made tunnels that's now controlled by them (like a mafia). See what I hate about this situation is the status quo, if Israel leaves Hamas alone, Gaza would remain under blockade for many years to come

I know the majority of Israelis want peace, so hopefully there's time.

As usual, anti-Israel. But that's not my point.

I browse r/worldnews. And I read and comment on every article regarding Israel. Now- I'm a liberal, mostly against lies and slander. And I see something, **in every article's comments**, that bugs me so fucking much.

Every r/worldnews article about Israel has someone who simply comments

And to every question like that, ""Evangelical Christian support, they believe the Jews need to be in the land for some religious prophecy.""

**FUCK THAT**. It is true that Christian Zionism exists and that evangelical/highly religious christians are generally pro-Israel. And yes, and even then, these evangelicals care more about abortion and Obama ""being a darn muzzie"" than Israel.

Now, a very liberal/young/atheist platform (as seen by the bias on r/politics and the popularity of r/atheism), it is easy to hate on religion (and as a liberal I understand this). Christian radicals, in general, suck, and reddit feeds on that. All r/atheism does is make fun of fundamentalist Christians, point out flaws in Bible or religious logic, and yes it is one of the most popular subreddits. We get it- radical Christians are stupid

So hating on Israel becomes *THAT* much easier when you view Israel as a project funded/created by radical Christian ideals. You view Jewish Israelis as white people who don't belong in the Middle East but took over the land because ""God promised them the land"", that seems like the stupidest shit ever, because, you know, the Bible is totally false, man. 

What is the **real** reason for current U.S.-Israel relations? It is simply strategic. The U.S. didn't give two shits about Israel until 1956. Until then, needing to counter the Russians in the Middle East in order to follow Truman's ""containment"" policy, invested in Israel which was seen as a worthy investment after the Sinai Campaign.

**Israel and the Arab countries fought the ""Hot"" wars in the Middle East for the Americans and Russians

That is the beginning of U.S.-Israel relationships. Russia supplied Syria, and the U.S. did the same with American technology to Israel. Then Israel and Arab countries fought ACTUAL wars. Nixon, Reagan, and mostly Henry Kissinger under the Nixon/Ford administrations, supported Israel very strongly as a way to ""stick it"" to the Russians. 

In today's world, and who is mini-America in a hostile region? Israel. Israel supplies intelligence, and fights terrorists that hate America as much as they hate Israel. 

I'm sorry for this long-ass rant, it irritates me like no other to see ""The U.S. supports Israel because the U.S. is full of backwards Christian fundies"" get 49 upvotes. Or any other number. Because it's false.

Edit: haissam93 has posted a very interesting Haaretz article. Summary:

It shows that the Israeli government has destroyed Palestinian ""huts"" in Israeli controlled ""Area C"". According to the complaint submitted, and the army went ahead anyway.

Now, and the immorality of the situation, saying that the UN has recorded 342 demolitions. Israel promised to ""look into it"", but never went through on their word.

The Civil Administration, and the plans the Palestinian residents submitted was rejected by the planning committee (doesn't say why). They also said the complaints against the officer were being investigated.

A complaint was submitted that settler are moving into Area B, and the Israeli High Court gives them 7 days to respond or action will be taken.

Another edit: The Guardian article right now on the front page believes that permits are hard to come by because of all the demolishing of Palestinian structures, or because they don't accept Israeli authority!

Correct behavior in the face of daily threats saves lives!

**How to recognize an event?**

When you hear an alert siren

**How to prepare your home and family.**

Due to the short warning time, choose a protected room which complies with the Home Front Command guidelines. Make sure all members of the household are familiar with your chosen protected space. It is important to select a protected space at any location you spend time in, to perform family preparations and to prepare an emergency bag. The protected space must be equipped according to the guidelines.

**The threat**

The main threat against the Israeli home front is from rocket and mortar attacks.
On the eve of the Gulf War

The IDF Home Front Command have developed guidelines for the residents’ behavior upon hearing the sound of an alarm or an explosion. Compliance with these instructions will significantly reduce any damage that may be caused by a rocket or mortar attack against the Israeli home front.

**How to behave during an event?**

**If you are indoors:**

Enter the MAMAD immediately and close the steel window shutter.

**In the absence of a MAMAD:**

Enter the room farthest from the direction of the threat

Close the door and the windows;

Sit on the floor (below the windowsill level) and lean against an interior wall. Do not sit in front of windows;

Upper story residents in a building with no MAMAD
 
**If you are outdoors:**

In a built-up area – enter the nearest building and act according to the instructions for persons taking shelter indoors;
In an exposed area – lie on the ground face-down and cover your head with your hands.
 
**If you are traveling:**

Stop by the side of the road, pull over and remain inside the vehicle for the next 10 minutes.
 
**Following the event:**

After 10 minutes, prevent gathering of bystanders and inform the security forces.

Iranians and Israelis are very similar in many ways with exception to government, I think this is because most Israelis have European blood.

Israel is an amazing country, I would love to visit some day!

1316218948.0,ki829,Israel Is Not An Enemy,MechanicalCrowds,77,36,87,"
I was raised in Egypt with the mindset that Israel is our sworn enemy. I was bombarded by the media since childhood of images explicit and implicit of a good-vs-evil type relationship between the two countries, immoral, brutish villains willing to do ANYTHING to further their means. I must have read about 150+ of these books. This is in addition to other forms of media, teachers, and general public attitude when it comes to Israel resulting in a self-propagating brainwash wave. A sociologist/psychologist can provide a scientific opinion on this type phenomenon but that's my two-cents. It is so as-a-matter-of-fact in Egypt that I've never seen someone pose the question: Why is Israel the enemy?
 

Differentiating anti-Israeli/anti-Zionism from anti-Semitism is always tricky but I would say that what I experienced was mostly the former with a little bit of the latter. Anti-Semitism seemed to have been more popular with the religious. I'm sure this general anti-Israeli sentiment rampant in Egypt is evident in polls
 

I propose that this is only the case because of non-rational
 

The Palestinian question is not Egypt's problem, the Palestinian issue is quite complicated historically, morally, and philosophically; having a virtually 100% population support for the Palestinian side is a clear indication that there is a bias. The question is why the bias to the Palestinians? Should we even be biased IF they are genetically closer to us? The answer is no. I am not sure if we are even genetically closer to the Palestinians but what we have in common linguistically and culturally for the most part is due to the Muslim conquests 1400 years ago or so. Unfortunately this 'new' Arab culture displaced a lot of the native Egyptian and Palestinian cultures and hence the commonality -however much that is- that we have now. Should we take sides with another country because we were invaded –and had our cultures somewhat overwritten- by the same people a few hundred years ago? That’s not reason enough for me.


Israel should not be an enemy; she's a neighbour and a potential friend. A healthy relationship between the two countries and people will be mutually beneficial. There are many things to be respected, like many other countries with a rich history. I'm sure there are also a few shameful moments in its history, also like many other countries, including Egypt. And I don’t find those moments to be more frequent or severe with Israel than anyone else. 


In fact, illiteracy, population, and extremism to name a few, doesn't make sense one bit. Israel has shown the world some incredible achievements in a short amount of time and a small population. We need to get rid of our irrational bias so we can learn from this A-grade student. There is no doubt in my mind that more trade agreements, information exchange etc with Israel would help both countries. It's unfortunate when you make an enemy for the wrong reasons. It's ill-advised if they are permanently residing next door. And it's just plain stupid if you can help each other instead.

First,500 Palestinians have died from 1948 (the founding of Israel) to 2010 as a direct result of conflict. Compare that to the 10 million people who died as a direct result of the actions of the Nazi party.

Second,000 Israeli's have died from Palestinian action and terrorist attacks. Let's compare that to all of the Nazis that were killed by terrorist attacks.

Now, comparisons to Nazi Germany are not only unfair, but they are deeply offensive to anyone who knows anything about the holocaust.

During only a few short years, starvation, torture) by the Nazi regime. So many dead bodies were burned at times that the sky was thick with ash as if it were snowing. Think about that for a second - your kids go out to play in the freshly fallen snow, only to find out it is the burned remains of human bodies.

Millions were tortured to death in concentration camps - they could not have medicine, and used for slave labor. There was even a case of one Jew's skin being made into a *lampshade*.

And you think that you can even *begin* to compare what the Israeli government is doing to [this](http://sztybel.tripod.com/05_nazi_lampshade.jpg)? [NSFW]

I met Issa Amro, as he says he is a completely peaceful, non-violent protestor.

While in the area, he asked me to ask him questions, so I asked him 2.

Why did the people of the West Bank and Gaza elect Hamas? (not verbatim, more homes are taken every day, and we do not have the simple freedom to move from place to place. A trip to Ramallah used to take 20 minutes. Now, that same trip takes 2-3 hours. There are 4 checkpoints on the way, where they can hold me up to three hours (at each), and it has taken me 10 hours to travel there. All in all, under their leadership, are great negotiators. Look at Gilad Shalit. They were able to take one captured soldier and exchange him for over 1000 captured patriots. While I do not agree with the methods they use

What is the resolution? A 2-state solution, no anything, while I have guns continuously pointed at my head. Israelis live under civil law, we here in the West Bank live under Israeli Military law. I cannot negotiate when I have nothing. I am oppressed, and Israel is the oppressor. How can a person in a giant jail negotiate for their freedom. Until we are given our basic rights, like freedom of privacy, speech, and others, if I have a gun pointed at my head and I sign a contract
He spoke about much more, to systematically take control of the area (even though it is illegal under international law - a quick interesting read that explains the basics on both sides, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_West_Bank_barrier).

What an AMAZING day. There was SOO much more that I saw

*The car*: The cars are [Renault Fluence](http://www.betterplace.com/the-company-multimedia-photos/index/id/72157623854339020) sedans, etc.  It's quite posh for the money that you're paying.  The car has a built-in GPS that also directs you to battery-changing stations, plays MP3s, dials Better Place for assistance, and guides you through swapping batteries.  It runs silently and is about as powerful as a Mazda 3 but feels heavier.  There are hardly any moving parts under the hood so far less maintenance.  On the downside, the battery takes up about half of the trunk space.  Also, the car can phone home and report your location if needed: Not good if you're into tin foil hats.

*The battery*: It's the first car with a replaceable battery.  Usually you just charge overnight at a station that BP builds for you and a full charge takes 6 hours.  A full charge gets you about 150km.  There are currently about 10 stations around Israel and by the end of the year there should be 40.  They are placed so that you can reach anywhere, levels it, then a hatch opens beneath the car and the battery is swapped from below.

*The energy*: It's more of a cell phone model: You buy kilometers/year,000) and pay for those; they pay the energy bill.  If you go over your limit, you pay 0.9ILS per km, which is like 10% more than gas prices.  20,000km per year, for example, is 1090ILS per month.  You get a break if you buy 4 years in advance.  Also, half off on energy.  The downside here is that you're not getting the savings: You're paying about the same as what you'd pay for gasoline in terms of kilometers, you get the battery stations and road-side assistance and public charging stations.

*Financing*: They've worked out lots of deals with banks, to make things easy.  Instead of paying up-front, you can pay 3200ILS/month for a new car plus an 80,000km-during-4-years package that includes the home charging station and everything.  People pay similar money for a company car but in this case, it's 4 years not 3 and at the end, you own a car!  Or for about 2400/month, you can get the same thing but at the end of it you owe 50kILS.  The idea here is to make it less expensive and at the end you sell the car and cover the 50kILS

I was most surprised that driving the car felt like driving a silent but otherwise normal car; I didn't have to re-learn how to drive.  Also

I think we can (mostly) all agree that ""proper"" terrorism is Not Cool, murdering settlers, etc.

I also think that most of us think that violent but generally non-lethal things like throwing rocks (both at cars and at individuals) is pretty uncool

How, independence-minded Palestinian act towards that goal?  Simply keeping your head down and working towards economic prosperity may lead to peace and a better standard of living in Ramallah and Nablus, but in the current Israeli political environment, I personally believe that inaction by the Palestinians will lead to them slowly being choked by the settlements.

The Palestinian move of being recognized as a member of the UN was, where 10 Palestinians are accompanied by 20 foreign journalists, are starting to get annoying.  Violence, we've decided above, is mostly unacceptable.

I've analyzed the results in a fairly simple analysis.
I discounted the votes for the parties with less than 2.5% of the votes.  
I've added an analysis for votes after discounting votes for suspected ballot stuffers (votes for the same party within 2-3 minutes of a previous vote for that party). I'll provide both the original results and the fixed ones to show you a comparison. So the number of seats after the deduction of suspected ballot stuffing will appear in brackets.  
I also discounted blank votes
Please note that I've rounded up the number of seats to the nearest whole number and have ignored agreements between parties for leftover votes (I don't know the intricacies of all the agreements).  
The seats are out of 120 Knesset seats
