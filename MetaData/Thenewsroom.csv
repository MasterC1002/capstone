Nina: Hey Will .. we're journalists.

Will: I wish you hadn't said that.

Nina: What?

Will: Everything would have been cooler

Nina: You have a problem calling myself journalist?
Only the elite few who cover stories nobody cares about

Will: I got a guy in my staff got hit in the head with a glass door Thursday. His forehead wouldn’t stop bleeding, and the 1st guy wouldn't see a doctor until the 2nd guy saw a doctor.

I've got a producer who ran into a locked door, &amp; the AP who sent him there hasn't slept in 3 days.
I've got 20-somethings who care about teachers in Wisconson. I've got a grown woman, who can make 20 times the money 3 miles downtown.

Okay there's the obvious stuff:

1) Sloan tells Will to go talk to the gossip columnist

2) Sloan sets Will up on a date with her friend who she knows who is crazy

3) These two people are the people who set up the teardown piece on will.

But! The thing that kinda tips the balance for me is in the party scene

I think they've also set this up in some more subtle ways. For instance when Will is getting yelled at by MacKenzie about the women he's dating

Then, Will keeps cutting her off, and shows no interest in what she has to say. They're setting up her motivaton. She thinks he's a dick, and wants to take him down.

Keep in mind that it was Sloan who first told MacKenzie that she thinks that Will is an ass -- of course she actually said that everyone else thinks he's an ass

I'm just guessing

Anyway, with-us-or-against-us storyline. 

What do you guys think? Is Sloan the mole? Or is this all an elaborate set-up?!?

This show is crazy though! I have watched the premier 5 or 6 times at this point

So I've been thinking a lot about what it is that has capitvated me about this show.

There's something about the combination of the language and pacing

I don't care that it's preachy sometimes

Aaron Sorkin does something interesting in that he creates these hyper-realistic enironments (the white house

That's what bothers me when people say ""but no one is *that* perfect."" When did it become a rule that characters need to be gritty and realistic and full of flaws? I think there's tremendous value in presenting characters as *what they ought to be*

Our culture lacks positive role models in media -- and it's not only kids who need role models. We all experience reality in the context of what we've experienced before and nowadays so many of our ""experiences"" are virtual, or The Wire, or Network. 

Yes it's important that realism exists (*The Wire* is a perfect example of realism done right) but I think shows like The Newsroom are equally important. They give us a glimpse at a world that's within reach. Something that isn't real now

Also, and so didn't get to see anyone's reactions – not even friends' or family's.

That being said

The reviewer for the AV Club writes that one of the main stories the episode tried to tell was ""how America felt when Osama Bin Laden was killed, solemn reflection, and a wide range of other emotions."" While that might be an accurate representation of the gamut of emotions that Americans experienced in *reality* (again, I really don't know), you would have never known it from the episode. 

What you saw instead was *unreserved jubilation* at the breaking news

While not wanting to speculate too much about what this unreserved joy says, I did spend a little bit more time thinking about the 'artistic' dimension of Aaron Sorkin's decision to include this, and how much of a contrast this was with some of his previous writing depicting similar incidents.

I think mainly of a story arc from the third season of *The West Wing* which – importantly to note – ran from October 2001 to May 2002. In this, that the Minister of Defense of the fictional nation of Qumar has himself been implicated in several terrorist attacks against the U.S.; further, he is due to visit soon on a diplomatic trip. During a meeting of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the suggestion is raised that they use the opportunity of his visit to assassinate him (one of the 'justifications' invoked is present in the title of the episode itself: ""We Killed Yamamoto""). 

The evidence against Abdul ibn Shareef, the decision is cast in the light of extreme ethical ambiguity:

1344503357.0,xxjtb,[Announcement] An Update Regarding the Spoiler Tags,Divtya_Budhlya,15,2,7,"Good evening

From /r/Thenewsroom

We bring you this special bulletin to make quick announcement about the the spoiler tags that we've been using on this subreddit. A few hours ago

`[This is the spoiler text](/spoiler)`

Going forward

`[Spoiler](/s ""This is the spoiler text"")`



####Why the change?


Those of you who're also active on other subreddits will recognize this new format right away. This is the ""new"" way of handling spoiler tags and has its own advantages.

* The new format lets you specify what type of spoiler it is. For example: [Spoiler S01E01](/s ""Will takes vertigo medicine""). Instead of just `[Spoiler]` you can use `[&lt;anything descriptive&gt;]`
* The old format only used to work with the styling of this subreddit. As the spoiler text was in the link text, all that would show up is the tag itself. 

The old format will continue to work in places where it has been used

`[Spoiler](/s ""OH MY GOD"")` becomes [Spoiler](/s ""OH MY GOD"")

`[Spoiler S01E01](/s ""OH MY GOD"")` becomes [Spoiler S01E01](/s ""OH MY GOD"")

`[Storyline Spoiler](/s ""OH MY GOD"")` becomes [Storyline Spoiler](/s ""OH MY GOD"")

You've been watching ModNight on ACN

Good night.

1374894370.0,1j52hi,Just started watching The Newsroom. My thoughts.,Cakey123,40,29,13,"Initially I was a little bit put off by the very artificial dialogue. The constant bantering and (hyper)articulate way in which the characters expressed themselves is a little off-putting at times; people just don't speak like that. I had the same problem for House and that's why I never liked it -- that and I despise the character of House who is not lovable but arrogant and *dogmatic*. (The latter is the most annoying thing because we are supposed to believe he is at all times rational and possessing ridiculous intelligence.)

This show won me over because unlike House it is not mean-spirited. The show is corny but it's a good kind of corny that you can't help but love (I just finished watching the episode ""Amen"" were they cover the protests in Egypt and I couldn't help but get a bit misty-eyed at the end despite of how *deliberately* corny it was). Now starting the next episode and hearing the theme song play I am charmed by the show. In House you just don't feel the love. You are fed that this character and that other love each other in this certain way but you just don't feel it; it's never there. The bantering in that show is always hostile and mean-spirited which makes it unenjoyable 
on that alone but also it further decreases credulity that the situations could ever happen in reality. Any human would not live in such a hostile environment for long.

GATHER ye rosebuds while ye may

Old time is still a-flying : 

And this same flower that smiles to-day 

To-morrow will be dying.


The glorious lamp of heaven

The higher he's a-getting

The sooner will his race be run

And nearer he's to setting.

That age is best which is the first

When youth and blood are warmer ; 

But being spent

Times still succeed the former.

Then be not coy

And while ye may go marry : 

For having lost but once your prime 

You may for ever tarry.

* Jeff Daniels-Will McAvoy - Just killing it so far. I like the idea that he is a brilliant conservative doing this show. I would like to see a few sequences of him taking liberals to task on air (as he did in the immigration debate they were having in the show planning

* Emily Mortimer-Mackenzie MacHale - Something is off so far. I really want to like her, so I'm hoping they can move her more towards the way I felt about Dana in Sports Night (not perfect, but very likable).

* Sam Waterston-Charlie Skinner - Sorkin will never not nail this role apparently

* John Gallagher Jr.-Jim Harper - Again I am on the fence with this character. The balance between brilliant and socially inept is not sitting well here either. (Tangent: I really, if only to build some tension and chemistry. Having Alison Pill's character be in a mildly abusive relationship while coming into her own professionally is interesting enough without an obvious foil.

* Alison Pill-Maggie Jordan - Probably the most problematic character for me thus far, complete with rescue from the knight in shining armor, is just inexcusable. There is a way to write a strong woman with a shitty boyfriend without making the woman seem unrealistically weak. There is a way to write drunken breakups, work mistakes (the boyfriend phone call?) and anxiety disorders without ruining a character, but Sorkin has struck almost none of the right notes. Ironically, I think she has fairly good chemistry with both the guys in this triangle, but I would like to see it end

* As for the others, so of course it is going to be a tad know-it-all-ish. To me, that is the basis of the show, so I never expected any less. Were people expecting them to do a news show set in the past where they made all the same mistakes the news actually made? Would anyone watch that?

The purpose of the speech is to make explicit these problems. The speech also convinced Don that Will's show is a ""sinking ship."", forcing him to leave. This is *very* important because Don's leave makes room for Mackenzie.

So a couple takeaways:

- First: The Daily Show website deserves an award for it's complete accessible archive of all it's videos.
-  TDS also does a really great job of reporting on stories while giving an editorialized perspective on the content much like Will McAvoy does
-  Other cable news organizations clearly do report what's happening in the world.  For example, as was shown in last nights episode, albeit mockingly.


So basically, you start to understand just how great a job TDS really does and why it wins Emmys year after year.

At first glance it looks like we open up with our main character having an epiphany and breaking out of his mediocre lot in life.  But as the show progresses it becomes clear that this is a misinterpretation.  He hasn't had a change of heart

It's clear

I think the show would have been vastly more satisfying if we'd spent some time watching him suffer in his daily routine.  I could appreciate his character development more if I could understand how his life made sense before our story started.

The pilot should have been about his old life as a boring anchor finally making him snap.  The episode should have ended with his great speech instead of opening with it.

“We're seventh in literacy, 49th in life expectancy, 178th in infant mortality, third in median household income, No. 4 in labour force, and No. 4 in exports,”

“America leads the world in only three categories: Number of incarcerated citizens per capita

These are the comments a news anchor yelled at a college sophomore during a conference held in at Northwestern University.  It was all fiction: the anchor, so is Northwestern University.

The first episode of Aaron Sorkins latest project ""The Newsroom"" has the speed and tensity of his debut series ""Sports Night"" and the emotional ties that came with the 7 years of ""West Wing"".  

After the opening scene and some character melodrama we learn that the day is that of the BP oil spill.  While the other news organizations are reporting a massive auto wreck and the new iPhone prototype had been left at a bar; our heros are putting together that this blast isn't simply a search and rescue

As always Sorkin breaks cerebral ground, and the numbers of government officials to drilling wells; 56:35000. 

The show stands on the perception that nightly news is spoon fed through corporate sponsors and watered down for the masses.  What Sorkin delivers is what would have been the news without the laundering.  Would the standard news room have more than just the fear of reprisal

Hopefully Mr. Sorkin will also be able to shine the spotlight on the Aztec two-step turndot once again.

THAT was riveting television. We've seen countless dramas on TV before that cover the interpersonal relationships. What Sorkin is doing with this season is no different. It's not even interesting!

The approach of telling the end of the story (how the Genoa reporting will ""destroy"" the team) and then revealing the details progressively isn't new. It's been done well before

I'll continue to watch just in hopes that we'll see it return to its former greatness.

*caveat... I'm well aware that Sorkin decided on a different approach to the season with an over-arching theme and storyline; not to mention the massive rewrites and reshoots for the early season episodes.
