It's the way that the original Cybermen - as a whole culture - replaced their body parts bit by bit. It wasn't one psychopath deciding to convert everyone like it was it is in the reboot; it was everyone willingly converting themselves

Imagine this. You are getting old, and then your elbows. All simple body parts - you are still most definitely ""you"". 

A little while later, it's all just bits and bobs. It probably disturbs you a little that these parts are all that will remain in your coffin after your body rots away, but ""Wow!""- you can see, hear and chew properly again.

Then a big one. You get a synthetic heart. It's a little sobering, your blood doesn't pump faster in quite the same way when you get excited, but you are still ""You"". You still think the way you did, and for the most part still 'feel' the same. That's all that matters.

This process goes on, one by one, until there are only a few left in your body. If you are honest to yourself, emotions are odd now. It's surprising how much of how you feel things is actually tied into your organs, nerves and endocrine system. And skin, too (replacing that was very odd). But your brain is intact. You are still ""you"". And so are your friends and family, even if they look a little different now.  

Then you have a stroke. It destroys part of your brain, nanotechnology has advanced so far now that the function of the part of the brain you have lost can be replicated by micro-machinery and circuitry. A bit of your brain is replaced, but you are still ""you"". You haven't died yet. You are still alive. 

Over the next few years

The day comes when a century has passed since that first hip replacement. Almost all of you has been replaced. You are 5% organic, but you have no doubt that version 78.0 feels almost exactly the same as 77.88. And the bits that do feel different are frankly an improvement: OS 77 wasted a lot of process time ""feeling"" things that didn't really matter to you any more. 

If one thing still makes you feel excited though

1369247583.0,1eulsf,The Doctor and the devil (x-post from r/doctorwho) [FINALE SPOILERS],NoMoreMrSpiceGuy,400,62,205,"This is a wicked long one

Moffat has, but also lots and lots of more subtle references. With all the evidence I’m about to show you, it has to be intentional.

I’ll start with the subtle comparisons. One thing Steven Moffat has loved to do is show how the Doctor is like the monsters in his stories. Over and over we see episodes where the ancient lonely monster is compared to the Doctor at the end of the episode. This all started with a line Moffat wrote in Season 2’s The Girl in the Fireplace: *“The Doctor and the monsters. It seems you cannot have one without the other.”* Ever since Moffat took over the show

1. **The Beast Below(s5e2) –** *“This dream must end, but it is also DEFINITELY about the Doctor.  Because as we see in the episode, the Starwhale is incredibly ancient, the last of his kind, and only interferes with the planet *“when children are crying”*. Moffat intentionally wrote the Starwhale to mirror the Doctor, so when the final poem is read by Amy as the episode fades out, we are supposed to apply it to the Doctor. This is the first moment in Moffat’s writing where he uses a word synonymous with the devil: the Beast. Right there in his second episode as show-runner. That word will come back.

2. **The God Complex(s6e11) –** A false beast is worshiped in this episode. At the end of the episode as it is dying, death would be a gift.”* He then says *“I wasn’t talking about myself.”* He was talking about the Doctor. The Doctor is intentionally compared to this beast.

3. **Asylum of the Daleks(s7e1) –** This one is less so

4. **A Town Called Mercy(s7e3) –** We’re starting to kick it up a notch. *“When I was a child, this man isn’t the Doctor, instead it’s the cyborg that is willing to destroy the whole town for his revenge. But he’s intentionally described in the vein of the Doctor. At the end of the episode, this is said: *“They’ve got their own angel watching out for them. Their very own angel who fell from the stars.”* Throughout the episode we’ve seen the similarities between the Doctor and the cyborg, so, just like in the Beast Below, the ending monlogue has two meanings. And notice that phrase again: “angel who fell from the stars.” An angel who fell from heaven. This is the way the devil is described in ancient mythology. It mirrors **Luke 10:18: “I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven...”**

5. **The Rings of Akhaten(s7e6) –** The old god is worshiped by the people of Akhaten. But it turns out he’s more of a devil than a god. He’s a terrible fire demanding child sacrifice and threatening to consume everything. *“Oh you like to think you're a god. But you're not a god. You're just a parasite. Eaten out with jealousy and envy and longing for the lives of others. You feed on them. On the memory of love and loss and birth and death and joy and sorrow.”* This monster, in the episode the people call him Grandfather, and the Doctor mentions to Clara that he had a granddaughter. This is to intentionally show us that the Doctor and the monster are the same, once again.

6. **Hide(s7e8) –** The monster in this episode is once again overtly compared to the Doctor. *“Every lonely monster needs a companion, SEEKING WHOM YOU MAY DEVOUR.”* This is ripped directly from **1 Peter 5:8, “the devil walks around like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour.”**

7. **The Crimson Horror(s7e10) –** The Doctor is introduced as *“my monster”*. He is the monster in the episode

That’s it for monster-Doctor comparisons pertaining to the devil. Notice how they became much more frequent in Season 7

Now for the direct mentions of the word “devil”. Is it a coincidence that every single time that word is put in a script it refers to the Doctor?

1. **The Wedding of River Song(s6e13)  –** This is the quote that started my theory. Even though it was hinted throughout Seasons 5 and 6, you look up and see the face of* **THE DEVIL HIMSELF**.” Now, this is the Doctor speaking to a dying Dalek. It’s a clever quote, because it’s describing himself AND the Dalek. But it’s definitely describing himself. He calls himself the devil.

2. **Hide(s7e8) –** We’ve already been over how the Doctor was compared to the monster, again, this is about the ghost in the house. But the Doctor’s entrance to this episode is loud knocking that exactly matches the knocking the “ghost” does later. He demands entry. That’s on purpose.

3. **The Crimson Horror(s7e10) –** A bit of a throw-away line, Mrs. Gillyflower’s nemesis in this episode is the Doctor. He is the one she needs to avoid to acheive her plan. In one scene she spills the salt, then throws some over her shoulder and says *“to keep* **THE DEVIL** *at bay.”* Clever writing.

4. **Nightmare in Silver(s7e11) –** Another clever throw-away, he hasn’t told you?* **SLY DEVIL** *”* and is immediately cut off by the Doctor taking back control of the body.

That’s it for actual mentions of the word “devil”. Again

Now let’s see the other names of the Doctor throughout Moffat’s Who. You might be surprised how often they are synonymous with a devil.

1. **The Pandorica Opens(s5e12) –** *“There was a goblin, soaked in the blood of a billion galaxies. The most feared being in all the cosmos. And nothing could stop it, or hold it, or reason with it. One day it would just drop out of the sky and tear down your world.”* Turns out it’s the Doctor.

2. **A Good Man Goes to War(s6e7) –** *“The Man Who Lies.”* Also called this in many other episodes.

3. **The Name of the Doctor(s7e13) –** Even though I had my theory over a year ago

Are there other things in the episodes

1. Rule One: the Doctor lies. This has only been “Rule One” since Moffat took over. Because it fits his grand scheme. The devil is the father of all lies. This rule is usually quoted flippantly by either the Doctor or River

2. The Doctor has a militarized CHURCH trying to bring him down for the good of the universe.

3. If you’ve been running your whole life from the fact that you’re the devil

4. Similarly, which I’ll get to in a minute).

5. And here’s **my favorite** little Moffatism. River Song, a phrase attributed to God, in two separate episodes. Once in The Big Bang. And once in Forest of the Dead, her very first episode!

Now how does this nicely tie up in the most recent episode, which he eventually tells to River, and which he dropped in favor of “the Doctor”. For instance, it could be summed up in the name Satan, or Beelzebub, although I doubt the name will ever be said out loud to the audience. **The point of the question is not THE NAME, but WHO HE REALLY IS.**

 John Hurt’s Doctor, before he took the name of Doctor. He did something so awful, so incredibly terrible in the universe’s future (his past) that he was the most destructive and evil force in all the universe. Maybe John Hurt’s Doctor even destroyed the universe. *“I watched creations freeze and burn. I was there when time ran out. Moment by moment until nothing remained. NO time. NO space. JUST ME.”* **(Rings of Akhaten)**

He somehow escaped into the past and regenerated into the first Doctor. He then took the name of Doctor, my real name, that is not the point. The name I chose is the Doctor. The name you choose, it’s like a promise you make. He is my secret.”* **(Name of the Doctor)**

He has been running from his terrible past ever since he took the name Doctor. *“The oldest question in the universe. The question that must never be answered! Hidden in plain sight! The question you’ve been running from ALL YOUR LIFE! Doctor Who? Doctor WHO? DOC TOR WHO?”* **(Wedding of River Song)**

*“Doctor who? It’s more than just a secret

He’s running from his terrible past, nothing can make up for what he’s done. And he always lets his companions down. He tells Amy she CAN’T have faith in him, because he can’t save her. He tries, but he can’t. He is the most terrible being that has ever lived.

Fitting that he ends up buried on a fiery graveyard planet that looks [*suspiciously like hell.*](http://redrocketrising.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Trenzalore.jpg)

*

**History:**

Time Lord Society as we know it, and The Other. As a species Gallifreyans always had an affinity towards time, and it wasn't until one school-boy wrote an essay with the idea that by having the nearby star go supernova, that time-lords could then travel through time. This boy received the lowest grade for this assignment, Omega. Rassilon however was interested in the idea, and the two along with The Other began to plan Time Lord Society.

Omega piloted a ship, was in fact a power play from Rassilon who trapped Omega in a dimension of anti-matter. It was around this time that Rassilon and The Other came up with the idea of TARDIS, regeneration, and the looms. The last of which was a direct result of Rassilon's showdown with Pythia, whose curse left the Time Lords barren. Many weeks after the battle, the Other disappeared along with the Hand of Omega. At that time, the visions of the three Time-Lords put their civilization front and center as the most powerful race in the galaxy. Many artifacts are left over from this time, and Others for shame.

One year
Not much is known about the Time Lords until the time of the Doctor

**Culture:**

All Time Lords are Gallifreyan

Time Lords will belong to chapters in their society. There are two conflicting versions of this:

One version says that Time Lord procreate sexually

Another version has Time Lords Loomed into Great Houses. The Houses are living things put forth by the decrees of Rassilon, fully grown but with the mental capacity of a toddler.

In their early days, carried a decree that called for any Time Lord to exterminate the leader of the Great Vampires on sight. However, these barbaric traditions were eventually phased out, much like the infamous Death Zone which would host dangerous species from all Time and Space.

In the days of the Doctor, The Doctor. In fact many of his classmates including The Rani, The Master, and The Monk became renegade Time-Lords, all though their actions usually caused a direct conflict with those of their former classmate, The Doctor.

Time Lord Society was led by a Cardinal

**Military:**

The Time Lords did not have an advanced military system, many of the Time Lord weapons incapacitated or required greater intellect and trickery to use. 

The most famous weapon was used by the Doctor to end the Sontaran Invasion

**Time-Travel Devices:**

The Time-Lords had two means of time-travel for many millennia it was the TARDIS or Time And Relative Dimensions in Space

**Time-Lord Genealogy:**

Every Time Lord born after the Supernova, or genetic thing. All though the Time-Lady, River Song was able to regenerate after the death of the Time Lords.

Time-Lords also have two hearts along with a third DNA string that gives them their Time-Lord characteristics. This allows for them to have super-human stamina

**Gallifrey:**
Gallifrey exists on its Time-Stream, sealed the Time War, all clones of Gallifrey along with Gallifrey itself disappeared from all time and Space. This led to the Time Lords fading into myth and legend.

**The Presence of the Time-Lords in the Universe:**

This can only be described as pre-Time-War and post-Time-War.

Pre-Time-War: 
Seeing a Time-Lord was uncommon

Post-Time-War: Many have not heard, Earth. Shortly after, all records of Time Lords disappeared from all known-databases.

**The Effects of the Time Lords on the Universe:**

That sounds a little ridiculous, I say. Take a look at [this screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/tNisYdo.jpg) of the book in The Bells of Saint John. Something is missing. Something crucial to the plot of The Rings of Akhaten, in fact. [This](http://i.imgur.com/zRVxiny.jpg) is what I'm referring to.

The teardrop scene where the page flips between her name and her mother's was an editing trick, meant to show the parallel between the two books.

So here's my theory (complete speculation incoming at this point): Clara and her mother both had a copy of the book. I'm guessing that Ellie bought a second copy of the book to give to Clara. Why would she do that instead of giving her her own copy? She didn't *plan* on dying. She expected to be able to keep her own copy as well. That way her and Clara could live their lives, but sometimes they would travel separately. They would then be able to get together and share their experiences together over their diaries, reminiscing about their time together while planning for the future.

The Angels Take Manhattan, more plotted out departure, the episode itself was awesome.

My theory is a little crazier. I think John Hurt is The Could've Been King. He is a Doctor that, and somehow managed to win. The way he did it though, it was brutal and cruel. It made The Doctor into something he never was and never wanted to be.

When The Doctor saw this chain of events about to happen, The Could've Been King still paradoxically existed. Angry about his timeline being changed, he led his army of ""Meanwhiles and Neverweres"" (or, all the Time Lords that The Doctor saved because of his cruel and calloused leadership, but died in order to keep The Doctor from breaking his promise) into the war as well. This new Timeline also necessitated the resurrection of Rassilon and led to his ""Final Sanction"" 

Seeing no other choice

HurtDoc is The Could've Been King. Not the warrior version

I know

1. Clara didn't see him because he technically never existed. It was only The Doctor entering the Time Stream that allowed him to be seen

2. The Doctor can still talk about the Time War and the fact that he ended it. The big secret is that he could have saved his people by committing horrible acts

3. It doesn't muck up the numbering

4. The Doctor gets to keep his name

We have all observed the similarity of the Doctor’s and Clara’s mannerisms, and strength of character.  In many ways she is a reflection of the Doctor.  The mirror is one of youth and optimism versus age and experience.

A good part of Series 6 was spent with the Doctor reflecting upon this past and what he had become.  One gets the impression that he is not too pleased with what he saw.  “A good man doesn’t need rules; you don’t want to find out why I have so many.”  Between Series 6 &amp; 7

Along comes Clara, chained alone in a room.  Next he meets Clara Oswin Oswald, who is both bar maid and governess, going against the class system of Victorian English.  Now he is with Clara Oswald, who made it quite clear to him that it is without the “Oswin”, she doesn’t want to be a ghost of the others.  In all three incarnations she refuses to allow others (society) to define her.  As her character developed we see that she doesn’t walk away from those in need of help.  In many ways she is as the doctor was when he set out on his adventure with the TARDIS.

Series 7B has been about the contrast of Clara’s youth and optimism versus the Doctor’s burden of age

So what does the Doctor’s name have to do with this?  When Clara discovered the Doctor’s name, other than simply he has a name.  To Clara, a person’s name is their identity, so later when she questions him about it; it’s not about what it is but rather why he doesn’t use it; why is he running away from himself.

Clara’s purpose is to remind the Doctor of whom he is, he can answer the question based on the values of his soul and not what others’ opinions are of him.

TLDR: Clara is telling the Doctor to “Remember” his true self and not her.

When I first saw the episode

Now I think this was much darker foreshadowing. She's sorry because of the implications of her knowing his name. She could only know his name for one reason

We thought River knew his name after their marriage ceremony, the Name of the Doctor, I think she learns it there.

However, River must be around for a bit longer, at least through the resolution of whatever terrible event occurs following the Name of the Doctor. He clearly wouldn't be taking her on a date if he had just unleashed the fury of the Time Lords on the universe, and River wouldn't be taking a team to the Library is he needed her help. This also indicates he certainly doesn't regenerate in the finale or the 50th. However, as Alex Kingston mentioned a spin-off in a recent interview, she can't be around much longer. I'd give her next season as her last.

Anyways, but I don't think so. As I mentioned in a previous post, I think it reveals a terrible past, and that's why he looks so scared when he hears his name. He knows that past has been revealed.",SPOILER,False,,False,t3_1dgmo9

This has been one of the best acted, most entertaining, high budget, seasons of Doctor Who *ever*. And I think that a lot of us forget, that it really is a family show in the end. Sometimes sacrificing a little bit of continuity for an easier to understand storyline is beneficial.

Doctor who may be the oldest question but it is well documented that some plot lines recently have been left hanging by the showrunners and writers (whom I shall henceforth collectively refer to as Moffat) just when we are promised more
answers. Some of these threads span several series (looking at you River) and have/are about to hopefully maybe converge(d) in the finale and 50th. I have attempted
to gather together all of the questions to get a clear idea of what is unknown to us the audience
suggest any. Also
first on the list is the question on everyone's mind:


1a) **Who is HurtDoc?** There are many
revealed to us in the 50th as it is an active plot point.

1b) **Why is he not allowed The Name of The Doctor?** Same as 1a.

1c) **Why is he wearing these clothes in [this image](http://www.kasterborous.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/dw-50th-location-johnhurt.jpg) from the set?** They are frustratingly similar to a combo of 8th/9th Doctor dress. Similar but not identical. Comparison pics: [8th](http://mattcbr.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/paul_mcgann_2.jpg) [9th](http://i91.photobucket.com/albums/k312/unopoo_2006/Blog/BIFXOtoCEAAHP1d.jpg). Perhaps this is a little bit of misdirection? Time will tell.

1d) **Why didn't Clara see him when she went into Doc's timeline?** Same as 1a and b as this will depend greatly on who he is. Is it because he is time locked? Is he a
future incarnation? Or even a pre-Hartnell

2) **Why didn't Clara meet any future incarnations?** I think the idea is that the GI only attacked Doctor up until current 11th to kill him at that point. Could do with clarification on this. Perhaps we will find out in the 50th since we did not see them leave the time stream.

3) **The Doctor DID fail to answer on the fields of Trenzalore. Does the prophecy remain unfulfilled? Was it wrong? Is it just Moffat being tricky?** This question is tied to what exactly the prophecy means.

4a) **How do they know all this stuff?** How did the Silence know about the prophecy and/or what they fear(ed) the Doc would/will do? How does the GI know so much about 
the Doc's future

4b) **Who even IS the Great Intelligence?** This remains unanswered in the purely television universe AFAIK and is likely to remain a subject for external exploration.

5a) **Where have the Silence gone?** Were they bad guys? Has the event they were attempting to avoid come to pass?

5b) **Is Jenny made to forget to lock the door by a Silent?** (From [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/1eonvl/spoilers_season_7_little_things_big_reveals/) by /u/silvarus) At this point in Earth's timeline the Moon landing has
not happened so the Silents would still be manipulating the humans.

6a) **Silence will fall?** We heard it from Prisoner Zero

6b) **Why did the TARDIS explode in series 5?** Is that John Hurt's voice declaring silence will fall? I am thoroughly convinced it is. How would that connect with anything else known about HurtDoc? This mystery is the most annoying as it is the biggest one left unsolved for multiple series. The half-answer the Silence did it is not very satisfactory.

8a) **What are the spoilers River mentions just before she goes in The Name Of The Doctor?** Is there genuinely more to be learned about/from her or was she just pointing out Clara wasn't dead? Probably.

8b) **Why does River expect 10 to recognise her in the library if that is the only time she sees 10?** Why does she only realise he is very young from his eyes
his face be a dead give away?

8c) **What did the Doctor whisper to River in Let's Kill Hitler?** Presumably his name knowing that she will need it in the future and that he is about to die.

8d) **When was the last time the Doctor and River met

9) **Is that a beetle or a tree?** (From [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/1eonvl/spoilers_season_7_little_things_big_reveals/) by /u/silvarus) It's probably a tree though...

10) **What actually happens at Trenzalore, not many people
will want to know how the Doctor dies.

11) **How aware of what's going on are the scattered Claras and GIs?** Clara says as she's falling that the only things she knows is that she must save the Doctor
this is shared by all her splintered copies.

12a) **Who is the woman in the shop that gives Clara the phone number for the TARDIS?** I suspect Rose or possibly somehow another Clara.

12b) **Why does ""Run you clever boy and remember"" appear as Clara's wifi password if it is
password and then asks how she is supposed to remember rycbar123

13) **Is [Amy's book](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Summer_Falls) supposed to be about Clara and does it hold any clues to the story?** It is likely irrelevant with a few parallels for fun.

14) **How does Strax continue to be so hilarious?** Seriously


15) **Doctor who?** Our attention is drawn to this question in Silence in the Library when we discover River knows his name. Since then it has been a plot point of growing importance which has, including, I would suggest, Moffat. We will never know, and that is good.

16) **What did the Doctor do during his seeming 200 years of travelling without Amy and Rory?** credit to /u/Meloku for suggesting this one. [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/1ep208/spoilers_finale_50th_doctor_who_or_the_ongoing/ca2fnf0).

&gt;***""On the fields of Trenzalore
when no living creature can speak falsely or fail to answer
a Question will be asked
  
&gt;***SILENCE WILL (MUST) FALL WHEN THE QUESTION IS ASKED.""***
  
...

We now know what all of that means.  Let's parse this:

&gt;**On the fields of Trenzalore

At the battlefield on Trenzalore, leading to the unveiling of his darkest secret),

&gt;**when no living creature can speak falsely or fail to answer

and when *death is threatened as penalty* for speaking falsely or failing to answer

&gt;**a Question will be asked

the Doctor will have no choice but to reveal his name, *a power which could pervert or destroy the Universe.*

&gt;**SILENCE WILL (MUST) FALL WHEN THE QUESTION IS ASKED.**

The one who knows the answer *must not answer because the Universe could be destroyed* should anyone know this password and gain access!  

But - fortunately or unfortunately - ***River Song, and because nobody can hear her, the *Question is indeed answered with* ***silence***.

The whole mystery of the Silence is now unraveled.  The whole time
  
In their attempts to safeguard the whole history of the universe, in their ineptitude nearly causing the end of the Universe themselves.  Next, they arranged to have him killed in such a way that his death was a fixed point on Earth, unable to be undone, perhaps believing that creating a new fixed point would overwrite the fixed point of his future death on Trenzalore.  This also failed, and in the process the Silence were dealt a heavy blow and could do no more to stop the inevitable from happening.  
 
Then a force beyond the Silence's reckoning, learned of his Tomb and the power contained within, and conspired to lead him there and force him to open it.  But, as usual, the villain failed to account for the power of the Doctor's greatest defense: the loyalty of his companions.  Clara went in after the Great Intelligence and thwarted him, inspiring the Doctor to do the impossible and follow her in turn, and together they quashed the G.I.'s ambitions.  
  
But the Doctor's incursion into his own timestream had consequences: his darkest secret and his greatest shame was unveiled and unleashed on the universe - himself

EDIT: More!  The original prophecy was only that Silence Must Fall When the Question is Asked.  Dorium's longer clarification of it came much later.  It would make sense that the cult of the Silence arose shortly after the Doctor's death and entombment.  Somebody must have realized that there was a great and terrible power behind the doors of that Tomb
  
The later clarification came when the Silence realized what the question actually was - the oldest question, gained eschatological, religious overtones, for the more they learned of the Doctor, the more they feared his Tomb.

We don't need the incarnation/amalgamation/dude with the funny robes known as the Valeyard to return to bring in the concept of the Valeyard. The concept is simple: there is a darkness inside the Doctor, who came to put him on trial and steal his lives.

Since the reboot, there was a clear conflict between the Doctor and the Dream Lord. After considering that the Dream Lord was part of the Doctor's psyche, you can really see their dialogue as an internal conflict, illustrating the deep seated self loathing we often see in the Eleventh Doctor - the Dream Lord even insults his choice of dress.

It hasn't stopped there though. In Nightmare in Silver, and while we usually see the Doctor arguing with some physical manifestation of himself, here we get to see it all in one body. I actually prefer this exploration of his inner conflict and darkness to the Valeyard and the Dream Lord, but that might because Matt Smith's acting was so wonderful.

However, but he's not the Doctor"" - when the darker side of the Doctor comes out, the Doctor tries to dissociate them from himself. At the end of the episode we see what we can only presume is a darker Doctor, who like the Valeyard and the Dream Lord will not go by the name of the Doctor. This inner conflict, likely dealing with his shame and self-loathing due to his past actions, would appear to be central to the 50th anniversary special.

So no, has a dark side. This dark side creates internal conflict, and characters such as the Valeyard, the Dream Lord, the Cyber Planner, and this new mysterious Doctor act as the manifestation of this conflict so that the writers can explore it and present it to the viewers. 

I couldn't care less if the man in the black robes returns to New Who - I'm happy with how they've explored the concept of the Doctor's internal conflict so far and seem to plan to continue to explore it in the coming special.",,t5_2tf29,False,h,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/1jbqpd/why_the_valeyard_has_already_returned_in_new_who/

Right now, as there is a huge body of history mentioning him and his role in the major events. Think about when he says ""Look me up"" in Forest of the Dead. 

If he has another name but wishes it to be secret, and thus by going by his new name, the Doctor, he effectively disconnects himself from that past.

It's a little unclear if he has always gone by the name the Doctor while adventuring. If he did pick the name when he was young (as has been stated by the Master), the Seventh Doctor is threatened by Lady Peinforte, who indicates she knows the answer to the question ""Doctor who?"" and has information about his past. This may indicate we are going to learn about a past life - the best way to work this into the current show would be through the Other, but that will probably be messy, so I'm not sure they would do that.

Clara (in the library): So that's who...

Clara (later): The library. I saw it. You were mentioned in a book... You call yourself ""Doctor"". Why do you do that? You have a name. I've seen it. In one corner of that tiny...

What I take away from this scene:

1. He has a name. A real

2. The name reveals a real story

What I infer from the exchange is that his name is something of historical or social significance that is familiar to Clara, or Aristotle; an influential cultural figure such as Jesus. Or Adam. Or Beelzebub. Most likely in my mind is someone relevant from the 50s or 60s, to tie in with the Hartnell period when Susan was being schooled, and some early mistake made by an inexperienced Time Lord on-the-run.

Watch Clara's face as she moves from ""I'm so clever - I worked out who he really is - and I got him to confirm it"" to ""oh my goodness

In the spirit of mis-direction it is also entirely possible to my mind that the name is relevant only to Clara

It also offers a solution to the ""what name could possibly not be a let down"". We are being offered a backstory with the promise of a further mystery.

About 2 years ago, but I feel it's important to consider again, in regards to the general negative attitude towards Moffat within this subreddit. 

I understand that a lot of the problems people have with Moffat stem from his involvement in the general overarching story arcs of each season. This is a criticism that can be considered valid, many had problems with ""The Curse of the Black Spot"", and most of those problems are placed on Moffat's shoulders rather than the man who wrote the episode, Stephen Thompson. While Moffat was certainly involved in a general sense with the episode, it's safe to say (at least judging by Gaiman's blog) that few, if any, of the major plot point ideas in the episode were Moffat's.

Well it's been a long and awesome trip but it's over. Oh, I decided to start from the beginning. I obtained all of the episodes and started my quest. I have to say it was great. It took about a good 3 or 4 months to get through them all. Thats watching a few serials every day. I realized that I dont have a favorite Doctor. They all have their amazing points. I figured I'd list them. Obviously this is all my opinion, and I would love to discuss. 

1st Doctor - I like him because

2nd Doctor - He was the one who always seemed like he was afraid of things. Always running around and overreacting, came through. I would say companion wise, Jaime and Zoe were the best. 

3rd Doctor - He was the badass. He was smart, especially after the 2nd Doctor seemed to be the complete opposite. Sarah Jane was obviously one of the better companions to the 3rd but I would have like to see more of Liz Shaw. 

4th Doctor - He was the nut. Crazy

5th Doctor - He struck me as the smooth, I could not stand. Peri was pretty cool but she flowed over more into the 6th. 

6th Doctor - He was the loud mouthed one. Very cocky

7th Doctor - He didnt seem to have one trait more than the other. He was a good mix of the previous Doctors. It was good to see him go from quirky in the beginning to a bit serious toward the end. I'd have to say I'll go with Ace on this one

8th Doctor - Today is when I watched the movie. I have to say

9th Doctor - I feel Eccleston did a great job. I liked his anger and I liked his goofyness. He was always all smiles but don't piss him off. I'd have to say I liked Rose better as 9's companion then 10's. 

10th Doctor - Here is where the real passion of the Doctor comes out. The happiness, goofy like 4, smooth like 5 and sometimes obnoxious like 6. He seemed to have the most heart. For companions I will have to say Martha Jones and Captain Jack, if you count him. Donna was great as well. 

11th Doctor - Now we come to the present Doctor. He has the goofyness factor. He seems more like a kid which is great. He also can switch to very passionate and angry. The obvious companion choice would be Amy and Rory, was awesome. 

Well, it's almost like I don't know what to do with myself. Now, I suppose, it's just waiting for the new episodes to keep coming. I will probably go back to some of my favorite serials from the old Doctors. I'm glad to have gotten through them. I didnt think it would be as interesting as it was. I was sure proved wrong. Having seen them all, I feel like a true Whovian. I know I didn't grow up in that era but I have nothing but respect for it and enjoyed every bit of it.

The GI would have never brought Eleventh Doctor to Trenzalore, but there would be no prophecy on the side of the Silence, and thus no need for them to create River Song. Since there would also be no cracks, there would likely be no Amy and Rory, because it would appear that the TARDIS brought the Eleventh Doctor to Amy because of the cracks (something to do with Amy's prayer to Santa Claus and her time-awareness, I assume).

I feel like a pure historical would be a nice change of pace for the show. Every single episode of new who has had some form of sci-fi based monster or villain

I feel as if some episodes of new who would have been so much better if written as strict historicals, focusing on Van-Gogh, and at times it seems like it was written this way.

Another episode that could have benefited from being a pure historical is season four's ""The Unicorn and the Wasp"". Unlike ""Vincent and the Doctor"" it was probably written as the standard monster-affair that it is

It's not just that he's in exile, and that's what all the references over the past couple seasons have been leading up to.

___
*I made this, because that's what I've written all this incessant rambling for.*
___

***RTD and Religion***
___

When Russel T. Davies took the reins of Doctor Who, this is where RTD met Christopher Eccleston). 

The story ends with Eccleston

With all this in mind, but merely to ""get people thinking about religion"" and create controversial television.

___

***The Doctor as a Religious Figure***
___

And in many respects, RTD chose to take the Doctor into a decidedly new direction: that of the ""Lonely Wandering God"" with a healthy dash of messianic themes.

It really doesn't take a serious amount of investigation to find these themes. Frequently the Jesus-like element of the Doctor is played up to near-outlandish levels

&gt; MASTER: Nothing will happen. Is that your weapon? Prayer? 

Followed by the Doctor's (frankly hamfisted) reveal of what the Master is horrified that the Doctor is going to say:

&gt; DOCTOR: I forgive you. 

This has pretty well defined RTD's Doctor, **Evolution of the Daleks**, **The End of Time, Part II**). 

The opening scene in **The End of Time: Part I** that depicts the TARDIS in stained glass and harkens to the Doctor as a ""sainted physician"" really underscores how RTD's Doctor is defined as having a peculiarly religious quality.

___
**Episode-by-Episode: What's the Doctor's Stance?**
___

While RTD's run may draw from religious themes and tropes

On the contrary: The Doctor

To give a proper run-down:

1. In **The Unquiet Dead** we have Dickens' rationalist mindset that seeks to explain away the inexplicable as trickery clashes with the sudden appearance of ""ghosts"". The Doctor explains in a relatively secular manner:  
&gt; DICKENS: Stop it. Can it be that I have the world entirely wrong?   
&gt; DOCTOR: Not wrong. There's just more to learn

   It's also important to note that this is the first episode where we see the Doctor rejecting religious beliefs in favor of pragmatism and helping the living:  
&gt; ROSE: But we can't [let the Gelth take bodies].  
DOCTOR: Why not?   
ROSE: It's not- I mean
DOCTOR: Not decent? Not polite? It could save their lives.  

1. In **Parting of the Ways** we see that the Daleks have developed a concept of blasphemy and an overall religious slant with the Dalek Emperor acting as their unholy idol.
&gt; DOCTOR: Since when did the Daleks have a concept of blasphemy?   
EMPEROR: I reached into the dirt and made new life. I am the God of all Daleks!   
DALEKS: Worship him. Worship him. Worship him.   
DOCTOR: They're insane.  
  
  Note how the Doctor reacts to the Daleks taking a religious slant

2. In **Gridlock** we hear the radio apologetically broadcasting the ""daily contemplation"" of *""The Old Rugged Cross""* out to the trapped inhabitants of New New York's titanic freeway

3. **The Impossible Planet**/**The Satan Pit** we see a decidedly more religious plot
&gt; IDA: What about you? [Do you have a faith?]   
DOCTOR: I believe, isn't it? The things you make up. The rules. If that thing had said it came from beyond the universe, I'd believe it, but before the universe? Impossible. Doesn't fit my rule. Still, that's why I keep travelling. To be proved wrong. Thank you, Ida. 

4.  **Army of Ghosts** has the Doctor once again meeting the (apparent) supernatural. We also see his response to the concept of life-after-death as he's being chided by Jackie for acting so rationalistic all the time:  
&gt; JACKIE: You're always doing this. Reducing it to science. Why can't it be real? Just think of it
DOCTOR: I think it's horrific. 

5. In **The Fires of Pompeii** we have an order of prophets acting as servants to the Pyroviles. This is more normal psuedo-historical revisionism so I don't take it too much to heart

And of course

It's obvious at this point that in some aspect or another

1. The TARDIS suddenly took off without warning. The Doctor then doesn't comment on why the hell that happened until the end of the episode

2. Clara is the one most severely affected by the TARDIS' departure. She gets knocked underwater *and* unconscious

Immediately upon Clara waking up, and I'm sure a ""never mind that"" in response to a magic blue box disappearing and shaking up the whole sub doesn't exactly put them at ease. ""Defense mechanism"" at least would've seemed like an *answer*, instead of a diversion of the whole subject. Granted, The Doctor is in the middle of a fight with the Captain at the time and wants to put his attention toward that, but in that case wouldn't putting him at ease be a pretty high priority?

By the end of the episode, and Sexy happened to rematerialize at the South Pole. The furthest possible point away from them on planet Earth. You could say that that was the joke, given the ""can we get a lift"" line, but that joke would've worked fine even if she landed in Florida.

The line once penned by Moffat in jest for the Doctor Who parody *The Curse of the Fatal Death* has gradually became a straight-faced catalyst for the actual show

I, but very little explanation. Why did the TARDIS explode? How? This wasn't just a mild curiosity, it was what the entire Fifth Series had built up to.

Then we get a who: The Silence. But we're still left wanting for a why and a how

I should repeat that: There has been **absolutely no mention of the Silence for over a year and a half**. I should also mention that there has been **absolutely no mention of the TARDIS exploding for two years** (and no genuine exploration of the TARDIS exploding for almost three years).

And then we have the larger questions that have been introduced: What is the Doctor's name

It's question after question after question

And then we have to take a look at the answers we have been given

And we all know how that turned out: An unmitigated, false drama that completely failed to live up to the hype.

For the past two and a half years the show's just been ""we'll explain later"", and it's beyond just irritating.

But first

* We've got the line by Oswin

* And then of course the Eggs + stir + minute = souffle = exterminate play on words. Oswin was resisting her urge to exterminate by baking souffles. As the 11th said in the beginning of the story- she was fighting the Daleks by baking souffles. More literally than we thought.

* Amy tells the Doctor that her marriage isn't something he can fix like he fixes his bowtie. Yet after he slips Amy his bracelet and the couple make up

* And then the Dalek/Oswin dialogue is brilliant. Especially the way the Dalek's voice nicely switches to Oswin's and back. Very good stuff here.

* I can't *not* mention how awesome it was to see Skaro. Screw continuity, Aridius, Vulcan, Kembel reference.

* The scene with Rory and the Eggs Dalek was just brilliant. It was funny when Rory thought they were eggs

* Last applaud for the usual clean streamlined sets and effects that Doctor Who has sported since 2010. Plus just all those Daleks. I love Daleks.

* The creation of the concept of the path network. Very good and logic idea on Moffat's part. It makes sense that the Daleks would have a central intelligence. They're not a hivemind

Some other things to note would be, you can see the emotion oozing off them.

And of course, but Moffat put a new spin on them. Whether or not you like the direction the Daleks have now been guided toward it is new and it is interesting.

Really, there are a couple things that strike me odd:

* The line: ""Rescue me chin-boy and show me the stars!""
* ""Who killed all the Daleks?"" ""Who do you think?""
* ""On a scale of ten? Eleven.""
* The Doctor repeating ""Doctor Who"" at the end. This especially.
* Daleks with a concept of beauty

And then of course the one thing everybody is going on about: the infertility. It's not sexist

Something I noticed today was that the idea of remembering and memory plays a huge role in Doctor Who from the moment Moffat begins his run.  We start with “The Eleventh Hour, and doesn’t forget. She tells everyone about him. Tenuous, but stay with me.

The story arc of the fifth series is the crack in time. What’s a major feature of the crack? People forget about your entire existence. 	Amy even forgets Rory because of this.  She later remembers him


And let’s not forget that Amy brings The Doctor back into existence by remembering him. 

Flash forward to the sixth series

In Series 7

Now, it reflects heavily on Moffat. He devoted a whole season to the Silence, so he clearly values memory and thinks it’s incredibly scary to lose. I think Moffat, a huge Who fan his entire life, is worried about how he’ll be remembered as a writer for the show. But that’s just my high school psychology thinking.

But what does it mean for the show? I think it all comes back to the fields of Trenzalore and The Question. I’m 100 percent sure Moffat is coming to come back to this – it’s too important not to. I think The Question

Firstly, which is how a show like Doctor Who should be. Alien planets, Russian submarines, haunted houses, and the TARDIS itself. I prefer episodes that are aided by their location, *The Impossible Astronaut / Day of the Moon* was good because it was about 1960's America, while *Silence In The Library / Forest of the Dead* had the brilliant concept of an entire planet as a library. This seemed lost from a lot of recent episodes, *Angels Take Manhattan*, *Rings Of Akhaten* benefited well from the new planet, as they not only provide a better atmosphere for the plot but also better fit the whole ""time-and-space travel"" idea. 



Secondly, but we have still yet to see another *Love And Monsters* or *42*. Those were fundamentally bad episodes with poor premises and poor writing. *Rings Of Akhaten* may have fallen a bit flat, a hastily introduced Big Bad and a ""Love Conquers All""-esque ending, but as far as filler episodes goes, it did have its enjoyable moments and was sparse in cringe-worthy ones. The same is true for *Cold War*, which was forgettable but not entirely *bad*. And while the filler episodes aren't nearly as bad as before, the good episodes are really very good. *Hide* was a fantastic episode with a unique premise and wonderful characters, and *Nightmare In Silver* was full of fantastic ideas and nearly flawless execution. People seem to gripe about current seasons and long for previous ones, and the good episodes are just as good. 



Additionally, she's everything you could ask for. She's intelligent but not overly brainy, she's brave but not overly courageous, and she respects the Doctor and follows his lead when she needs to. As a result, the Doctor has treated Clara very well. Rather than being a sidekick, or someone being led on a tour guide, the two work together in a fantastic dynamic. The Doctor can be the boss making decisions, but Clara can just as easily assume leadership



Lastly, it's been **way** over the top. During Series 6, we had something like three story arcs going, and it ended up consuming entire episodes just to move the plot along (*A Good Man Goes To War*, *Let's Kill Hitler* and *The Wedding of River Song* are what I'm referring to - practically impossible to rewatch as stand alone episodes since they are devoted entirely to resolving story arcs). It seems that recently we would have arcs introduced to us with big huge implications and they would consume entire episodes and then they would just be dropped. However, Series 7b doesn't suffer from this nearly as much. We have two story arcs going - The Name of the Doctor and the Identity of Clara Oswald. While these both are either obviously or potentially very important mysteries, they are not obnoxiously dramatic like previous ones. The Cracks In The Wall arc ended with the explosion of the TARDIS and the end of all of time and space, but these arcs aren't of that huge or cliche'd caliber. They are relevant, because that has become an old trope. They also haven't overpowered the entire series. We get some advancement as the series goes along (""She's just an ordinary girl"" from *Hide* and the Doctor's exposition near the end of *Journey to the Centre of the TARDIS*), actually



This is all how I feel about this series. I've never truly disliked any series, I think that 7b is a vast improvement and I'm quite enjoying the run so far. So what say you all? I hope I'm not the only one around here who is happy with the show. ",DISCUSSION,False,,t5_2tf29,False,,

First - The Tardis exists simultaneously throughout space and time.

Second - The Tardis always takes the Doctor where he needs to go.

If the Tardis exists throughout space and time, the Tardis can put the right Doctor in at the right point in his life, along with the right companion(s) to achieve victory.  

So if the second Doctor would fail in one situation and the tenth Doctor would succeed,  would fail, but the same Doctor with Clara would succeed, the Tardis put the Eleventh with Clara in.

Moreover, the Tardis would not have taken the Doctor to Sako when she did.

Also, he needs an adventure and he needs to pull victory from the jaws of defeat using native wit and cunning.  So if a threat would tax number ten to his limits, but be a walk in the park for number one, the Tardis would go to the time and place with number ten and let him be sucked into that fray.  And vice-versa.

The Tardis is the unsuspected hand of fate for the Universe and the Doctor.  This brings up the third thing we learned about the Tardis. She stole the Doctor.

1349112441.0,10rpih,My Theory on 1938 [Angels Take Manhattan Spoilers].,SirDiego,143,24,49,"A lot of people have been complaining about how it doesn't make sense that the Doctor can't go back to 1938

The angels in Manhattan are not in 1938, otherwise I think we would have heard about it. *Our* Statue of Liberty is not actually a weeping angel. The weeping angels essentially ""carved"" out a chunk of time for themselves to use as a time energy farm. They made a little section of time that they could send people back to over and over again. 

That's why the TARDIS couldn't lock onto it. The Doctor should be able to go to *normal* 1938, it didn't blow up present day New York (or, if you will, ""Doctor's Timeline New York""). It's not the same New York.

A few other things: 

* The graveyard happened to be the tie-in to Angel Farm Manhattan because that was where all of the victims of the Angel Farm were laid to rest. That's why the TARDIS kept landing there. The graveyard has a temporal connection to the Angel Farm.

* Rory and Amy cannot be picked up in 1939 because they're not in 1939. Ever. The angels continue to loop them and they are stuck in Winter Quay, they kept looping him, over and over until he got old. The only difference is that now Amy is with him and they got to loop continuously in 1938 together. 

* People have been bitching about how they got food to the Winter Quay. People aren't stuck in that room. They can leave, an angel is going to get them and send them back again. They aren't locked in the room, they just keep getting sent back until they are old and bedridden and eventually die in that room. 

* River doesn't go back to Angel Farm Manhattan to deliver the book to Amy. We know River is good at getting messages to people in weird times. In the episode

* ""Why can't the Doctor just pay somebody to make a gravestone with Amy and Rory's name on it?"" The tombstone is merely *symbolic*. Amy and Rory don't die *because* their names are on the tombstone. Their names are on the tombstone *because* they died. There's nothing saying that the Doctor couldn't change their fate at that point. The tombstone is not like the book and nobody said that it couldn't be changed. The book is something from their future timelines (because River and Amy write it later) and that's why it has power. The tombstone is no such power. It is *just a tombstone.*

* The Doctor doesn't think that he *physically can't* go back to the Angel Farm Manhattan

* Another note about the tombstone, as in ""1938-1987."" Also, it's a tombstone, so I'm sure it would be the full date ""*19*87."" Amy was five years older than Rory (probably because of time traveling). Rory died at age 82 (in 1938); Amy died at age 87 (in 1938). 

* No ""new rules"" were invented for this episode. River consistently doesn't tell the Doctor about his future because of ""spoilers."" We have never really seen what she's talking about until now. Now, but it's been consistently applied since the introduction of the rule). Even regarding the ""Library"" episodes, the Doctor knows that he can't go save River, because she died in his timeline already. ",,False,,False,t3_10rpih
1369410697.0,1ez5v3,"What do you think the story will be going forward from ""The Name of The Doctor""?",avidday,140,19,58,"My personal theory:

John Hurt is the Time War incarnation of the Doctor, i.e. the Time Lock. He takes Hurt with him and picks up 10 along the way. With three Doctors working together simultaneously, they will try to find a better solution, one that avoids the destruction of Gallifrey and the Daleks and somehow manages to end the time war, all in one big happy ending. However, I don't think they will succeed in finding that solution and the season/special will end with the Time Lock being applied and we'll leave just as Hurt STARTS his regeneration, or immediately after it finishes if they want to edit in shots of the 9th.

The interesting part is that they whole episode/series will take place from INSIDE the 11th Doctor's time stream. I mean

(Put on tinfoil hat here

The Silence know the only way the time lock can be defeated is for the Doctor to enter his own time stream and to effectively rewrite the event. This is what they are seeking to avoid and what the three (2.5?) Doctors will figure out: that unlocking the Time War will destroy the universe. They fear that the 11th will do just that, the 10th and Hurt will stop him at the last moment, to make him see that he ultimately did the right thing all those years ago.

(Extra Layer of tinfoil required beyond this point

Alternatively, causing the whole war to spill out of the 11th Doctors time stream and onto the Fields of Trenzalore, but thanks to that tear, they are all at a point in time BEFORE the planet is ravaged by the battle. The 8th season will be about the time war playing out on Trenzalore and the Time Lords attempting to get back to Gallifrey to fulfill their plan to destroy the universe. The 11th will stop them, ultimately sacrificing himself while possibly simultaneously killing all of the Time Lords and the Daleks on Trenzalore (at least all of the Time Lords that wanted to destroy the universe). Before the new 12th leaves Trenzalore, he takes one of the TARDISes of one of the other time lords, sets its chameleon circuit to exactly match his TARDIS, knowing that one day he will have to return to this place upon his final death

but not today.

SPOILERS,knockturnal,130,11,41,"I know a lot of people here have huge issues with the Valeyard, the Dream Lord was a reminder for both the Doctor and the viewers that the darkness is there and the Valeyard is still coming. With the existence of the meta-crisis Doctor

We know the Valeyard comes into existence at some point between the 12th and final incarnation of the Doctor. We also know something happens at the fall of the 11th.

“On the fields of Trenzalore, a Question will be asked, a question that must never, ever be answered.”

Something happens when 11 dies

How do they know this?
Why can't the question be answered?

We don't know who made the prophecy, unless he somehow dies outside of Time. He's been to all ends of time and has no idea what is going to happen and why it's so bad. Thus, the prophecy isn't a fortune, but rather is valuable information passed on by another time traveler.

That brings up the second point. Why is the Question bad? What will happen when it is answered? If the Doctor is dying and the answer is spoken to a enemy, but because the Doctor does? 

When the Doctor dies, and he hears the Cloister Bell, a warning of danger. His biggest fear is becoming the Valeyard, so when he sees the Valeyard, possibly with his TARDIS, his response is ""Of course, who else?"". 

When the Valeyard comes into the picture, and since the Silence arc has overwhelmingly defined this incarnation, the Silence arc must be related to that evil. 

This leaves me with this theory:

The Valeyard is created due to the darkness that grows in the Doctor when the Question is finally asked. In my opinion, who?"" is most likely not ""who are you?"" but ""who will you choose?"". Either way, the answer is something that the Doctor will struggle with, bringing out his darkness in a way that he can't control, eventually creating the Valeyard either during his regeneration or after an extremely existential run as 12. This is why the question cannot be asked.

The prophecy comes from the Valeyard himself. In order to set the darkness into motion, when he was the true evil all along. The is what he realizes when he answers the Question, spawning the series of events that leads to the creation of the Valeyard. This also explains why the Valeyard goes back to try to defeat 6 - the Valeyward know's he can't actually kill the Doctor because he's already witness his own defeat, but he also knows that the experience of battling the Valeyard will begin the process of creating the Valeyard.

Seventh Doctor Regeneration

I loved this regeneration. There is something beautiful about the Doctor dying due to senseless gang violence and human misunderstanding. Somehow, and when he has been, he has only been stunned. Here, while he is not shot fatally, he is finally seriously wounded. The Seventh Doctor, the most cunning, manipulative Doctor known to us currently, shot by simple-minded gangsters. The world is absurd and uncaring

His real death is due to the botched surgery, jumping into conflict in an attempt to save the day. Here, when someone else does the same, it all goes wrong. The Doctor dies at the hand of a flaw he himself suffers from.

The Introduction of the Eighth Doctor

Amnesia is often an over-used plot device, and I think the scene where he describes Gallifrey especially displays this. However, it would have worked better if the movie was longer. It takes up a little more time than you'd like for a movie that is only an hour and a half.

The Eighth Doctor

I don't think anyone has ever argued that the Eighth Doctor ISN'T wonderful. He has a strong sense of romanticism and awe, the Eighth Doctor manipulates time in a more subtle, light-hearted way by giving them advice to help them in their future experiences. The only con here is that there isn't more of him in the TV series.

Grace

Grace is very Liz Shaw-like, just like the Eighth Doctor. The scene where she cries at the opera - as the Eighth Doctor finds himself, you know they're perfect for each other. Her response to the Doctor is far more realistic than the response of many other characters (not just in the movie, but in the entire series). She's also pretty much the best American character up to the movie (seriously, she blows Peri away). However, she does set the romantic relationship precedent, which is one of my major problems with Modern Who.

Chang

Chang reminded me strongly of Turlough. Chang acts incredibly human, when he chooses to call the ambulance and wait for the surgery to be finished, that he's more than a wannabe gangster. I like that they follow it up later and he takes a stand. However, the acting isn't great and we don't learn enough to identify with him strongly.

The Master

I first thought I would hate him, rather than herself). I felt like despite the body, dress, and American accent, I could definitely see the Master hiding behind the body.  The Master was incredibly well done in Classic, but in no way was this Master bad. He's definitely an improvement on the melt-man Master in The Deadly Assassin, but I do think the other Classic Masters and Modern Masters were done better.

The TARDIS

This was the best TARDIS ever

The Eye of Harmony Plot

This plot greatly improves on The Deadly Assassin, and I liked the distorted window scene, as it was both aesthetically interesting and harked back to Classic's ""weird sci-fi stuff is happening, no time to explain"" tendency. The half-human thing is of course the most controversial, but I think it's great that we have it to argue about. In my head cannon, the half-human aspect was a trick on the part of the Doctor to make sure no Time Lord could ever take control of his TARDIS. I like the idea that he used the fob watch to make himself half-human, but obviously unless they directly address it, but it sure added an interesting aspect to the Doctor Who history.

Overall Production

I felt this was a very American-esque movie. As an American, but it was better than a lot of the Classic Who acting. Also, the budget was pretty big and the effects were improved, so it was definitely the most aesthetically pleasing piece of Doctor Who as the time.

-The GI feels. Intensely. The vehement hatred was practically dripping from him when he was describing the Doctor to the others in front of the Doctor's grave. The Daleks, and other less featured or one off baddies try to be without emotion, but they eventually end up showing hate or disgust. I think this weakens them, as it breaks their own code and usually is the key factor in their defeat. I think that the anger and rage are what fueled the GI, and as they are the driving force behind his actions they only make him stronger as they increase. This can be seen in the Master as well, at least in New Who. 

-The GI isn't over powered. His inability to be killed may seem souped up, rare artifacts or super powers. As Strax says, ""The heart is a simple thing.""

-He actually got physical with the Doctor. Usually the Doctor yells and points his screwdriver to make his enemies go away, being above the Doctor, grabbing him in a way that incited violence, etc. I can't even remember the last time a villain laid hands on the Doctor, and it made him seem incredibly vulnerable without the armor of his reputation.

The first thing I'd like to say is that I love the character of the TARDIS. I love the fact that the show has crafted this unspoken but incredibly powerful bond between the Doctor and his TARDIS. It's one of the most unique relationships on television

But my real point is that the magical quality of their bond hinges on the very thing that makes it unique: the fact that it's unspoken.

I'm quite firmly of the opinion that giving the TARDIS a voice is a lazy (or at the very least

As the TARDIS is given a more literal voice I can't help but feel that a lot of the character's magic goes away. The idea of the TARDIS having a ""holographic voice interface"" not only makes very little sense and flies in the face of common sense and show history

***THE DOCTOR'S WIFE***

*The Doctor's Wife* was the first episode where we really see the TARDIS and the Doctor entering into a dialogue. In fact

&gt; DOCTOR: You did. Look at us talking. **Wouldn't it be amazing if we could always talk
IDRIS: You know **I'm not constructed that way.** I exist across all space and time

#

&gt; IDRIS: It's sad when it's over. I'll always be here
DOCTOR: Goodbye?   
IDRIS: No. I just wanted to say hello. Hello
DOCTOR: Please. I don't want you to. Please. 

The scene. That incredibly heart-rending, on the TARDIS not being able to speak to anyone.

This entire moment is *ruined* by having the TARDIS have a little chat with Clara. Once you show the TARDIS being able to bicker and hold proper conversations then you've *completely* drained the power out of that scene. You've made it *meaningless*.

***THE MAGIC OF THE TARDIS***

The TARDIS is one of the few truly mysterious and magical things in Doctor Who. We've learned about the Doctor's home planet, and now up-and-coming (apparently) [S7E14 SPOILERS](#s ""his name""), but we've never really explored the TARDIS.

It's been this mysterious being

The beauty of the TARDIS is that she's not the Enterprise. There's no ""onboard computer"" that you can ask to analyze things and give you a report on your blood's toxicity levels. She hasn't got an EMH or holodeck or some interactive virtual personality. She's so much more than that

1370249507.0,1fkkr5,"A fun ""What If"" based on recent news [Spoilers - 50th &amp; possibly S8 if I'm a psychic of some sort]",keozen,141,31,66,"Ok

- I'm going to assume that John Hurt is either a very old 8 or the true 9th that they don't count in the Doctor numbering because he did something so against who they feel they are that the Doctors disowned him.

- I'm going to assume that the rumour/news that Matt had signed on to be in who in 2014 came from somewhere BBC way but wasn't meant to come out and misunderstood

**The idea:**

*The 50th:*

A self encapsulated story where 10 &amp; 11 try and stop Hurt doing bad things. They either realise straight away or later (not important when) that he is a part of them and while they succeed in stopping him SOMETHING is done to 11 by Hurt that effects him. You see hints of the dark side of the Doctor come out

Fast-forward to...

*The Christmas Special:*

The Doctor is losing control of himself. Whatever was triggered in the 50th is slowly taking over him. He has Clara more or less guarding him, a PlotDevice^TM if you will. This can be whatever the writers want, a chanting collection of uber-nuns, a genetic altering supercomputer made by apple in the year 3298, whatever. The important thing is that it is to be used to split the dark personality from the Doctor so he can regain himself.

Frantic things happen to get the Doctor into THE DEVICE^TM a couple of times the darker side takes over and it looks like he is trying to flee. Each time he is put back and finally the device starts, a bribed guard, whatever) comes out and kills the Doctor while he is still in the machine's effect. 

Regeneration begins, there is a Timelord soul hovering above us. The golden energy mixes with the CGI representation of the darker side of the Doctor, it starts to grow and take the shape of a humanoid. 

The room starts to go into meltdown as things go pop around the new &amp; still unconscious Doctor as things tend to do in New Who when there's a regeneration. There is some sort of announcement that life support is about to give up or something. We see the new Doctor still motionless in the background as a shadowy figure exits, the shot pulls away as we see him in new clothes from ""plot convenient location"", something all in black, it's Matt Smith but not the fun and jovial Matt Smith we've seen before, he's serious and a little scary.

Probably the most common complaints against the NPDs are: the colours, and possibly some other issues, too.
The colour: As we know, to me, this makes the Daleks ever more menacing. As heavily mutated cephalopoids bent on the destruction of anything foreign to them, the Kaled mutants would have little knowledge - or care - for our human asthetic. Their designs would exist purely for functional reasons. The use of colours easily distinguishes the ranks (or, we could say 'caste system') or each Dalek. Using these colours with little regard to what a human may perceive as ""cutesy"" or ""cuddly"" makes it even more terrifying to realise that holed up inside a 'less threateningly coloured' exterior is a creature of pure hate.

Similarly, though possibly due to fan backlash to the redesign or budget we haven't seen this yet. However, this still may exist as an in-universe explanation for why the back of the NPDs is bulkier than in previous MKs.

As for the height on the wholes the NPDs appear to be more technologically advanced than their predecessors. This is only logical as they are created well after all previous MKs. If they house greater technologies within

As I said, more 'space age' - terrify the child in me more than ever before.

1357931799.0,16e6ip,The Time of Angels and The Great Intelligence,flagondry,125,15,42,"In *The Time of Angels* River reads a passage from a book about the Angels which doesn't seem to have any connection to the story being told in that two-parter. However it does seem to bare some resemblance to what the Great Intelligence says in *The Snowmen*. In *The Time of Angels* it seems to be implied that the book was written by the Doctor (in the future I presume). 

First of all

**The Time of Angels** 

RIVER: I found this. Definitive work on the Angels. Well

(The Doctor riffles through the pages of the book.) 

DOCTOR: Not bad. Bit slow in the middle. Didn't you hate his girlfriend? 

**Flesh and Stone**

OCTAVIAN: [asking about the Doctor] Doctor Song

RIVER: I absolutely trust him. 

OCTAVIAN: He's not some kind of madman

RIVER: [beat] I absolutely trust him. 

I think the use of the word 'madman' is supposed to imply a connection. We also have the ""I am definitely a madman with a box"" quote a few episodes earlier in *The Eleventh Hour*.

Secondly

**The Time of Angels**

RIVER: [reading from the book] What if we had ideas that could think for themselves?  What if one day our dreams no longer needed us? When these things occur and are held to be true

**The Snowmen**

SIMEON: [possessed by The Great Intelligence] Now

So could there be a connection here? Or am I reading too much into it? It seems like a lot of words to waste on something that has no impact on the story at hand

 That episode basically is 80% build-up, while being a good episode over all, I could see the potential for one of the greatest episode ever.

TATM is one of my favourite episode of Doctor Who (I've seen only the 2005 series). But, I saw some crack here and there. These are more choices I would have made than critique to the episode, by the way.

It didn't hit me until the second time I watched it, but The Doctor was making sure he hadn't regenerated in between the Christmas special and The Bells of St. John as a possible reason as to why Clara didn't recognize him.

The second one was from The Eleventh Hour. I literally watched this episode a dozen times before I caught the reference, but nothing tastes good to him. At one point, I believe right before The Doctor grabs the fish fingers and custard, little Amelia offers him carrots. The Doctor replies with something like 'Don't be ridiculous'.

The **FAQ link** now sits at the top of the page and r/gallifrey sports a **header bar** to sort posts by date/popularity/etc. The **episode discussion** of the week has also been moved to the top of the page (you can find all past threads in the Gallifrey Wiki). Hover over text appears whenever one chooses to submit a link or self post and the colour scheme has been created. All tagged posts will appear green.

We have rewritten the **Subreddit Rules** as seen in the sidebar. The Gallifrey Wiki (also in the sidebar) will take users to more detailed explanations of Submission and Spoiler Rules. You can also find external links to other Who related websites.

**Spoiler Rules** have also been clarified. You can read full details inside the Gallifrey Wiki in the sidebar

There is a new **Report/Tag for Moderation** button. People may feel hesitant about reporting users’ posts and comments

The changes you can’t see are the ones that will be enforced by us. As the new respect and courtesy paragraph in the sidebar says

We want to maintain the spirit of this subreddit: a place where people can freely express their opinions and have civil discussion. Attacks and offensive language silence people. We won’t allow this to happen.

**Downvotes** do this too. Other than removing the downvote system (which we won’t do again)

Downvoting is bad. It discourages discussion and it creates an unwelcoming environment. It tells people that their opinions don’t matter or aren’t wanted or aren’t legitimate or worth discussion. Don’t downvote. Don’t silence others. Write a response to them instead. And if you see a person being mass downvoted for unjust reasons

Lastly

We welcome any **suggestions for the FAQ**. Anybody can suggest a topic, or message the moderators to make a suggestion. We will take all suggestions into account excluding one: **we will not discuss canon in the FAQ**. For obvious reasons. People can read the FAQ and interpret its contents in relation to canon in whichever way they choose.

Thank you for reading this post and we hope you enjoy the changes we’ve made. Even now we are planning more improvements.

It's the Doctor's power that allows him to travel through time and space and show people new worlds and his ability to change events throughout history

The chapter brings up the often unaddressed topic of power in relation to the Doctor's companions. They are always inferior to him. Companions don't like to admit it (like when Rose states she isn't his ""assistant"" in School Reunion) but there's no denying it. No matter how assertive and loud -mouthed (Donna) they are

He stole Donna's memory despite her clear no

Martha and the Doctor. Martha is in a way, she joins UNIT when she leaves the Doctor, *she* chooses when she leaves the Doctor which rarely happens.

But Martha is often at a disadvantage and the Doctor fails to acknowledge the difference in power between them (I think he fails to notice Martha much at all really). Like in the Shakespeare Code when Martha reminds the Doctor that she can't exactly walk through the past without trouble.

**Martha**: Oh

**The Doctor**: Why would they do that?

**Martha**: Not exactly white

**The Doctor**: I'm not even human. Just walk about like you own the place. Works for me.

This right here shows the way in which the Doctor totally misses the point. The power difference between the two of them is a big issue. The Doctor really could walk around like he owns the place, or knowledge to pilot a TARDIS to get herself out of a jam like he does. No companion has all that really.

The chapter goes on to talk about the Master/Lucy relationship and how it's basically what goes wrong when a Time Lord takes advantage of this power difference. Lucy is seen with a bruised eye and a limp

The book also talks about the Master/Doctor relationship and how the Master drains 10 and treats him like a dog with a bowl that even reads ""dog"" outside of his tent. He totally humiliates him. Which is pretty much what 10 wanted to do with the Master- keep him like a pet in the TARDIS. The two of them are in this constant power play that frankly can easily be looked at sexually (it's even in the classic series) even if I don't ship those two.

Though it's clear both of them want to have relationships with their companions

And even though the Doctor wouldn't do that kind of thing it's an issue. It's like when your teachers or parents (this is the books' analogy) tell you to treat them as friends. But obviously that can't work out because they are the ones who grant you your grades and allowance and privileges. What if you accidentally mention when you went partying with your friends? But at the same time you can't refuse their friendship. It's a tricky thing. The same way

Joan Redfern knew this and it's one reason why she wouldn't go with 10. She tells him, assuming she ever came to love him. Joan is perceptive and realizes the imbalance of power. This is also one reason why I've found 10's statement to Wilf about humans looking like giants to be disingenuous (and 10 ignoring the power dynamics again).

This doesn't mean the Doctor is evil or anything. He's a good guy,"" (127).

The Doctor does just that in Waters of Mars and even has that problem again with the TLs in End of Time. Nothing changes when we get into *The Eleventh Hour* either. ""We're encouraged to see Amelia and the eleventh Doctor as the same - adventurous and childlike - rather than what they actually are: a small and vulnerable child and a powerful alien

This chapter about exploring the power distribution between the Doctor and other characters really interested me. It also reminds me (and is mentioned in the book) that this issue would be addressed should the Doctor ever regenerate into anything other than an able, cisgendered male. Obviously he wouldn't be walking through human history as easily anymore. Why haven't we had a female Doctor or Doctor of color? If the Doctor lost some of the power he owns by belonging to any of those categories would he also lose appeal for fans?

1375504728.0,1jm03e,New thoughts on Amy's Choice,darth_elevader,121,19,15,"This episode didn't really stick out to me the first time I saw it

To start off, but once that's been revealed I think there's a lot more to catch on subsequent viewings.

To start off, I think this line of dialogue shows that the Doctor really wants to see his companions well off and would like to be the type of person who goes back to just visit his old companions, but that's not who he is. Meaning, that this world isn't just ideal for Amy and Rory, it's ideal for the Doctor too.

I really like the dream lord, always questioning himself and hating himself. I feel like this is the way the doctor always thinks or the way he thinks during a lot of his adventures, but this episode is the only time we really see it.

Obviously the dream lord shows how much the Doctor hates himself (I mean they straight up say it in the episode) but the last piece that I think is really interesting about the episode is that the biggest verbal blow to the doctor over the course of the episode doesn't come from the dream lord (doesn't come from the doctor himself) but from Amy right after Rory dies when the Doctor says he can't do anything to save him and Amy replies ""Then what is the point of you?"" I thought it was a pretty brutal thing to say to somebody. Not entirely sure what I think that means in terms of the whole episode but it's interesting to me.

It's hard for me to put everything into words. I haven't covered everything here because I can't think of every little point I thought of

I think the CHARACTER of River Song is cool - and would have made a really fun companion, and the emotional connection that eventually linked Ten to her was really palpable in that episode, so I was willing to believe that there might be such a woman in his future (though I was skeptical that he would ever actually marry out of love because in +/- 900 yrs, he only came close to that what, two, maybe 3 times and never actually tied the knot?).  


But every story line that has included her has just not convinced me at all that there is a deep connection between The Doctor and her beyond her own adventurous imaginings.  She is as much of a groupie as Amy or Martha and I just sense no true chemistry between the two of them in a way that makes me want the Doctor to be married at all.  (I felt more chemistry between the Doctor and JACK!)  By S6


I guess after seeing the trailer, I am as much enthralled with the romance of the Doctor as anyone - but I really love the Doctor for so much more than just that -- the adventure, the scope of emotion, the learning of wisdom, the discovery -- all that just feels dull within the River-Marries-the-Doctor story line.

First I want to bring attention to just how young Piper was when she took the role, but in many ways Rose managed to make believability a strength in her performance. At no point did I feel that Rose wasn't a real ordinary person and a lot of that came from Piper.

Her chemistry with Eccleston was superb. They would banter and share a laugh over chips and do that weird three person ""into the future!"" fist pump thing. They would dance and look at both death and life together. The two just clicked exceedingly well and it really helped to sell Doctor Who coming back.

Not just lines of dialogue but soundbites of quotable nuggets that get regurgitated over and over. Unlike the sparsely used (and notably versitile) ""Fantastic!"" of Eccleston's run or the self aware should-I-start-saying ""Allons-y"" of Tennant's Moffat in particular has a notable tendency to perpetuate these memetic phrases.

I'll first take note of ""wibbly-wobbly timey wimey"". Initially the flub of an explanation that ""got away from"" the Doctor in Blink it was later reused in Time Crash, but says it in unison with him anyway.

The phrase later resurfaces again in The Eleventh Hour

It's actually a bit sad. It's like he's trying to make ""fetch"" happen.

Anywho apparently he did get it to happen because we see it transform into the fairly nonsensical ""spacey wacey"" in The Doctor's Wife then again as ""timey wimey"" in The Girl Who Waited. Then finally as... dear god

But why does the show do this? There are far more tiny ones that crop up (""penny in the air"", etc.) that take a line and repeat it. Why?

Ultimately this factors into the trend of Moffat's run. Many mistake him for being a ""bad showrunner"" and in many ways he does slip

Catchphrases are inherently easy  to write. Hell, catchphrases are a cheap and easy way to have characters memorable and seemingly unique.

But I want to hear the other side. Doctor Who's been no stranger to catchhrases (would you like a jelly baby while I reverse the polarity of the neutron flow?) and they can be used properly in the right context and with moderation. Ultimately

So...In this episode, but I believe that Rings of AKhaten will be one of the few episodes that I'll look back at since the re-launch of Doctor Who as a global superstar and view as some of the best writing. In fact, between you and the few thousand readers of /r/doctorwho and /r/gallifrey, I'm a big enough man to admit that Neil Cross is one of the few writers in television today that has constantly managed to enthral, delight, and in this case, cry like a little baby at the beauty and simplicity of the story.

Seriously. Between Neil Cross and Neil Gaiman, I genuinely believe that Gaiman is *that important* as a writer in the late 20th/ early 21st century, and if you haven't read neverwhere or American Gods by now, you bloody well should have. In fact I'll wait right here while you go into town and by them both, or download them to your e-reader.)

But I digress. The undertones of this show are wonderful; they're written by a person who has a wonderful grasp on the concept of Causality and synchronicity; in the opening scenes, as Clara's father explains, had to grow in that precise space, to be blown off of the tree at that particular point in space and time to give birth to this entire future whereby two people fall in love, and give birth to the new companion - Clara. It establishes the caring, nurturing environment in which Clara grows, and establishes a vital difference between herself and the former companion of Amy.



**The past: Where we've been.**

Amy, as she seemed to be very underwhelmed by many of the things she saw - she filled a role in the Doctor's life though, and provided something that he very much needed at this point in life - someone matriarchal, bullish and take charge, who didn't appear to be afraid to Scold the doctor like a naughty schoolboy when she felt he was getting out of hand. I recall a few points, particular during the lucid moments of the insanity that *is* the Tenant era where RTD and Moffat have written it into their scripts *in a very specific way* that the regeneration process, at least in part is guided very much by the life experiences of the previous incarnations. 9 was  guided by the grief of having freshly escaped from the ravages of the much talked about, and a need to cope with the grief of having lost not just a few people, the redemption of the Master, and to act in the greater good.

This, I've always always considered the strong possibility that the Doctor is ""the other"" - that third aspect of the Timelord society that was responsible for the enlightenment and subsequent birth of Gallifreyan society into the race of Gallifreyans, and the society of Timelords...But I'll tell you all about that some other time. Once again, I digress.



**The Present: Where we are

The point is, fairly convinced you saw the seed of this during the children in need special that Moffat wrote a couple of years ago, where we're treated to a five minute dialogue of David Tennant and Peter Davidson conversing, and remembering quite fondly the past, and how the past influences the future. Isn't that a lesson we should all learn and remember? That what we do in the present matters every bit as much as the past, because it dictates what happens in the future? Matt Smith represents rebirth, and absorbs many aspects of the previous incarnations - the childlike wonder of 2, the curiosity of 4...These are all examples of things I *personally* see

Even in the title sequences that have been introduced this year, and will not be forgotten under his watch.

And looping back into the point about the companions, I believe will nurture and comfort, and encourage him to once again find his feet in the universe. In letting go of page one, Clara is demonstrating a resonating theme through all the 7 series of the new who era - that despite all those moments when he feels like he's let his companions down and *feels* like he's alone, he never truly will be. The long loved, and sorely missed Elizabeth Sladen demonstrated perfectly that he will *always* have a home, *always* be loved, because I see more than a little of Sarah-Jane in Clara.

The rings of Akhaten is very important in this respect; you have a wonderful piece of dialogue that made me cry more than a little, but the demon *within him*, finally letting go of all of the grief and sorrow that has held him back, and acknowledging that it's time to move forward. To run. We even see, for the first time, the Doctor starting to acknowledge his history again, by dropping the revelation to Clara of the existence of his Grand-daughter, but I disregarded that almost immediately. I look forward to Stephen Moffat's explanation though.

This, and turn grief into madness, which, with a man that can travel in time and space and do *pretty much* anything, is no good combination. In series 7, I believe that as the question will be answered, so will the final vestiges of his scarred psyche be healed


**So where is this all heading?**

I personally believe that this may well culminate in one of two possibilities; the doctor facing his demons of the last great time war, will see 11 fall through all of space and time, and in his closing days, meet Rassilon and Omega once more, and re-form the ancient society of Time lords, by going back to a point *before* Gallifrey was consumed by the void, and hoping that by surrendering himself to the loom, and the Gallifreyan race redeemed much in the way that the master was.

Either way, cry, and reminisce about all of those times as a child that I would sit on my grandfather's lap, and cuddle into him as I witnessed Jon Pertwee and Tom Baker save the world once more from the multitude of evil that lies out there.

It made me realize that most of the people who have worked or are working on Doctor Who now, Nicholas Briggs, David Tennant, probably a lot of others too, they were fans during the dark years when the show was off the air. When no one was making Doctor Who except fans. And those people, they did in the late 90s what we're all doing now. They got on their message boards and they shared their fan theories, and they obsessively read the books that kept the show alive, filmed their own fan movies.

I know that some of us prefer the emotional connection of Davies stories. Some of us niche players prefer Nicholas Briggs' descent into madness and darkness in the Big Finish stories. And some of us prefer Moffat's timey wimey craziness, but there isn't a lot else. Not really. I mean, Harry Potter is seven books. Seven pretty good books, but that's it. The Whoniverse is big enough to get lost in. Big enough to stake out your own corner and claim that it's better than all the other corners. But we shouldn't be doing that. We should be celebrating how awesome the whole is, and how lucky, how truly lucky we all are to be along for the ride. Maybe Moffat's created a character you just can't stand. Maybe R.T. Davies created a character or two you just can't stand. Maybe David Tennant haunts your dreams and you just can't stop wishing he would come back.

A few months ago, I took a break, and watched Moffat with fresh eyes (not coming from RTD era).

Still disappointed. The pacing was off, plot holes that were made just in the sake of looking cool. WTF is up with so many paradoxes. So I took one of the most often repeated things that people say here: that Moffat returned DW to its classic roots.

So I watched all the classics that are available. Totally enjoyed it. And while I got the feeling that 11's stories have undergone a similar slump to 4's (the first few Colin Baker episodes were meh)

1) Moffat's writing for DW seems to me like it caters more to an American audience. The tropes used, not a Brit, you say. Sure, but decades of writing hinged on silly, witty, subtle British humor is replaced by the rather overt and superficial Hollywood comedy. It's kind of disappointing. And it seems like Moffat is pandering to a wider pop audience.

2) Moffat's run has less camp, albeit humorous tale of a mad man in a box. DW, from the Classic to the RTD era, is about a humorous tale of a mad man in a box, albeit with a dark undertone. The difference is that drama and complexity are NOT what the Classic and RTD era was hinged on. It was hinged on FUN, but in the course of that fun we encounter fantastic problems.

3) In relation to campiness, Classic Who just wants to tell a story, whether that story looks or sounds cool or not. Moffat's run seems to be concerned with making everything cool--cool enemies, cool people, cool story arcs--that it seems like they're trying so hard. Sure, you can say that RTD tried to made everything GRAND--but we're talking about scale here.

The way I see it

Moffat took Classic Who and thought of ways how it could look cool. Think of someone taking a classic car and pimping the hell out of it

The recent Christmas special though--that one's a bit good. I wish I could have skipped the whole Pond arc with the abysmal pacing and the stupid exploding TARDIS and all of those insane plot holes,False,,t5_2tf29,False,,,t3_17lxev

###The Seemingly Exponential Growth of this Community


When I first discovered this subreddit 6 or 7 months ago, and it quickly became my favorite and most visited subreddit. I was obviously not the only one that fell in love with this community, and since my first visit, the subscriber base has more than tripled in size and is quickly approaching the quintuple digits. On one hand, this is a great thing. A discussion based community thrives when more opinions are thrown into the melting pot. Because of this influx of new redditors, /r/gallifrey has become a place with a wealth of different insights and perspectives, and has become a much more active community. On the other hand, however
   
I apologize in advance for this annoying list of grievances. 


###The Hive Mind and the Circle Jerk
   
Yes, these phenomena are very real. I see many of the same ideas rehashed over and over in the top comments and it can become a chore to search through them for new insights. One example of this that I recently saw was in the ""Least favorite major villain thread"". Not only was the top comment about Slitheen, but also at least half a dozen other highly voted comments were about them! I don't even see them as major antagonists! This is not the best example, but this is just one of many instances I have seen recently.   
  
We can counter the influence of the hive mind by using the down vote button sparingly and using the up vote button liberally. Don't just up vote posts that you agree with
  

###Factual Questions  
  
Opinion based questions, in my mind, because new people can bring different ideas to the table. Questions regarding factual information, however, should not be asked multiple times. Regeneration limits, for example, is a topic that has been asked about countless times on this subreddit
I don't mean to say that all inquiries about facts and trivia are useless

  
###Let's be Nice to Each Other

I'm sure many of you have seen Loki's recent post about the importance of canon and the heated argument it instigated. I always enjoy reading Loki's posts and having the occasional chat with her and I was very disappointed to see the way in which vulgar language was used against her. I rarely see that kind of discourse in this community
  
Arguments are valuable. They are the very basis of a discussion based community. Conflicting opinions
  

   

        
While instances of these things are still relative rare, and accepting. 
  
  
As a side note, and I have to start studying for finals... so I'll save my thoughts on canon for a future post.

1375835720.0,1jum5h,In Defense of Martha Jones,maccam21,118,28,44,"Martha tends to catch a lot of crap in these parts and it's always bothered me because I think she's a great companion.  A lot of complaints seem to center around her romantic interest in the Doctor and her inability to let go of those romantic feelings (something that the Doctor doesn't help by being flirty and misleading on a number of occasions).  So  I figured where better to speak out in Martha's defense and start a conversation then /r/gallifrey? Here we go:

I'm one of those fans that likes just about everything and every part of the show (started with New Who and it's the basis of my obsession but I've seen a fair amount of classic and liked a lot of it and I'm in love with 8's audios) and just about all the eras/companions etc.  That in mind I subscribe to many of the same complaints about Rose that others here have.  I mostly like her but she wasn't exactly great at being a companion.  Her romance with the Doctor was a little too prominent

Martha was a great replacement.  She's a med student

As her season goes on (and it has some of my favorite episodes *Gridlock*, *Utopia*) many claim she gets whinier and fault her for being in love with the Doctor.  Let's get real people. An attractive man falls from the sky being a charming kickass space wizard and literally sweeps her off her feet and gives her access to all of space and time.  In their very first meeting he kisses her (as part of his solution to the moon situation) and then comes back to take her on a trip.  She has every reason to develop feelings for him.  It's a realistic story beat and the more time she spends in close proximity with the Doctor the more those feelings develop.  Can you argue that fresh off the Rose romance this was the wrong kind of character arc to introduce and perhaps a Donna type companion would have been better?  Sure.  But that doesn't make Martha a bad character.  She's a really enjoyable one whose intelligence and competence are a welcome change from 9 and 10's time with Rose.  Martha is much more pro-active and action oriented and it's one of the reasons season 3 is where New Who really takes off (don't get me wrong, there was a lot to love in seasons 1 and 2). Her decision to leave the Tardis is based on her unrequited feelings and it's a nice character beat that shows that she's a strong woman who doesn't want to be defined by loving a man that doesn't love her in return.

Her season 4 episodes are great too.  She thrives after the Doctor becoming a vital member of UNIT and bringing a lot of the Doctor's philosophies with her.  She even delivers one of my favorite companion moments in *The Doctor's Daughter*.  (""I'm doctor Martha Jones

All in all she's a well rounded character who brought welcome change to an early era of New Who and I feel like she deserves more credit than she gets.  Agree? Disagree?  Wanna punch my nose?

It depends on whose canon you're going off of.

River caused the Doctor's secret identity.

tl;dr: another guess at what's next in the saga of the fallen hero.

**Clara and the Second Doctor:**

First, this is being stated and restated, and each time the Doctor accepts it, doesn't understand it, and keeps searching for his answer.

Now, but first I gotta give some explanation of what I think Clara is as a character (a theory of the writer's perspective) and why that character is relevant.

We know this 7b season is full of Classic Who references and shout-outs due to the 50th anniversary coming. But one Doctor in particular seems interesting here. The Second.

I haven't watched almost any Classic Who

I recently watched the Doctor's Revisited about the Second Doctor. We can see the influence on Matt Smith's (and Tennant's) Doctors

Well I noticed a couple things (and one part that I think brings this all together). First, and it seems possibly deliberate, especially when we look at the two companions they highlighted in the special...

The Second Doctor's two female companions that were talked about in the special were Victoria and Zoe. Who are these two characters? Well Victoria is a girl from Victorian times

Now I think the comparison to those past companions is not to say Clara has any in-show relation or connection to them. Just that this half-season is a love letter to the Second Doctor

There could be theories connecting it all with Jenna's statement of ""meeting the doctor more than 3 times"". But I don't have enough to connect her to anything else for certain, but it is possible to connect her to the past in many ways (the ""Second Doctor"" theory, could do it, but I am not currently using it for that reason).

Well now that we have that: ""Clara is a normal girl"" (for now) and ""7b is a love letter to the Second Doctor""
  
  
  
    
    
    
**The Doctor




After I learned that the Great Intelligence was from Classic Who shortly after The Snowmen

These Great Old Ones were once similar to the Time Lords of their universe, which adds to the intrigue). I really first thought that the GI would play into a larger part of the Doctor versus the gods this season, especially after the Rings of Akhaten (which I thoroughly enjoyed seeing him fight another, similar or related monster/god, but the rest of the episodes didn't seem to support this season focusing on the ""gods"" much more).

What is truly great about these characters, civilizations, an the entire universe at times. It leaves a great question of ""What could the Doctor become, in his own hubris, if given the same power as The Great Old ones?""

(I have further speculation of the future of Who with that, which I will elaborate on in another post to r/Gallifrey). 

So, but we can see the Doctor influenced one of his past encounters with him (unknowingly?) when he gave him the plans to the London Underground in The Snowmen.

So here we have the Doctor fighting a real life ""god"" (well a god in a sense of immensely powerful extra-dimensional being

We don't know a lot about the GI's complete motivations or plans, using powers to influence and manipulate sentient beings.

So to conclude this theory







**Clara Reincarnated:**





My earliest theory was that Clara must be tied to these ""old gods"" I read about (either as one unknowingly

I think Clara is in some way being used by the Great Intelligence. Either he is planting her in each encounter

This could be related to the GI's desire to have a body (trying to use Clara as some kind of vessel?) But I don't give that idea as much weight as Clara (the ordinary girl) herself doing something in the Finale to go back in the Doctor's timeline to help him (and help him *remember* something).

Now you might wonder how the GI is related to Clara's first appearance in Asylum, and Current Clara both met the Doctor with the appearance of the GI, so I think its possible to see some connection.

The way this villain is constructed allows him to be inserted into many theories, it could very well mean a connection to the Silence and past arcs as well. I don't know the exact stakes the GI would have in the Doctor's name itself (plenty of other theories on its importance and how that will play out), but I don't think he was re-introduced with Victorian Clara, and again with Current Clara, defeated but not extinguised, is no mistake or coincidence. I am sure we will see him again, and very likely in this finale if we are learning what the reincarnations of Clara really mean.

That is about it for my theory

Apologies for the unorganized mess this might be to read

Moffat &amp; Co. intended each of these episodes to be its own big blockbuster, ZAP They're gone!  Hardly a way for the longest-running companions to leave the show.

Another problem was the order and time of each episode.  It was unclear how long it had been for the Doctor (hell, and what kind of changes they'd been going through since we last saw them.  It was almost like Amy and Rory were different characters in each episode because they went through so many experiences on their own that we didn't see.  The Power of Three really illustrated this problem: somehow Amy had been through several jobs and we found out that they had been traveling with the Doctor for ten whole years.  It really made me feel like I wasn't witnessing all of this important stuff, and that I didn't know these characters as well as I should have.  

Part of the fun of past Doctor Who is that there was that rentless forward momentum that made us feel like we were traveling with the Doctor

I'll only be submitting 1 story per Doctor

1. William Hartnell - 1st Doctor: The Dalek Invasion of Earth
 The story is a great introduction to Hartnell's initial Doctor, is the performance. Hartnell's Doctor was silly to a degree, with the ability to keep composure but still be a fun old man. He had a playful personality and it comes out to a degree here and makes it a perfect introduction to him.

2. Patrick Troughton - Second Doctor: The Mind Robber
 A Master story, and shows why Troughton solidified the show's popularity throughout its early trials.

3. John Pertwee - Third Doctor: The Curse of Peladon
 James Bond of the Doctors! Pertwee was trapped on Earth in exile from Gallifrey

4. Tom Baker - Fourth Doctor: The Ark in Space
 Sorry to those who would put forth *Genesis of the Daleks* as the story to watch, his huge shock of burnette curls, and the odd smile he gets when he offers someone a Jelly Baby all contribute to his strange performance, and putting him on a ship meant to save humanity? Perfect. The story of the Wirrn possessions and transformations give this a darker, meaner, yet fairly lighthearted story that makes it a grand introduction to arguably the most popular Doctor (even if he isn't your favorite, the statement is objectively true).

5. Peter Davison - Fifth Doctor: The Caves of Androzani
 Unfortunately for Davison his final story was also his best. I love most of his run, however, is special. Its such a rough story, and shows the Doctor's regret as he whispers the name of a fallen companion on his deathbed. He shows his youth here, but now is where we begin to see him for the Old Man in a Young Body that he is becoming. He was young for the first time in years (centuries by his reckoning) but he had a rough time.

6. Colin Baker - Sixth Doctor: Trial of a Time Lord
 I recommend this one not because its perfect, don't deny it) but with a darkness to it. We get to see him silly, angry, triumphant, and an utter failure. Its a bit of a watch at 14 episodes but well worth it. Bonus! We get the Master and the Valeyard, and the latter's appearance has sparked so much debate and discussion that one might find watching the whole thing worth it merely for that.

7. Sylvester McCoy - Seventh Doctor: Remembrance of the Daleks
 Its McCoy, this story is also chosen to highlight the history of the series with references as well as for McCoy's manipulative ability as the titular character. Enjoy.

8. Paul McGann - Eighth Doctor: Doctor Who TV Film
 This is a ridiculously hard one to talk about because while I despise Eric Roberts's portrayal of The Master I love McGann's Doctor (yeah, even feeling like a man in his early 20's at times, and he adds something to the role even if the story is thin as hell.

9. Chris Eccleston - Ninth Doctor: The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances
 Moffat makes his entrance! After the dark portrayal of this Doctor got bogged down with fat

10. David Tennant - Tenth Doctor: The Girl in the Fireplace
 Many will cite *Blink* and while that is usually the first episode of the show that I have people watch my favorite will always be this entry. The Doctor shows affection, and there is a lot of discussion about what being with the Doctor does to people. 

11. Matt Smith - Eleventh Doctor: Amy's Choice
 Arguably the best of his episodes (yes yes, and its not a bad place to start with this Doctor.

Alright, alternatively, and aged Eight after his experiences in the Time War.
Personally, he's aged incredibly well and seems rather eager to come back- in fact, he's probably the most readily available past-Doctor besides Tennant.
Another thing worth noting: Tennant and Smith hinted in their behind-the-scenes video that,"" and that this mysterious character seemed rather ""bemused"" by the two Doctors, even though Ten and Eleven rather enjoyed each other's company. Some have speculated that this is the Not-Doctor, but that doesn't quite make sense because he seems more likely to be a villain than a Doctor that the other two can team up with and have very much interaction with. Other, much more crazy fans say it'll be Eccleston, but c'mon, he's not coming back.

You probably see where I'm going with this by now. Yes

""How?"" you say. Well
So that being said, John Hurt goes on some kind Doctor-hunt across time and space, trying to alter the Doctor's timeline.

This might explain how Ten and Eleven meet, but I don't think that's where they're going with this because hopping between universes just seems out of place in this story, how would the need for that be justified?

So now we've covered how Tennant comes back, and Eleven, all joined forces to stop the John Hurt Doctor, who, like I said earlier, is an aged version of Eight. This could be interesting, because Ten and Eleven would know who the not-Doctor is and why they're fighting him, not wanting to let him know how he ends up in the future.

This is also an opportunity to finally clear up the McGann-Eccleston regeneration, hooked up into molecular dispersal chamber or whathaveyou, Eight is lying on the ground, trying to reach his sonic but Hurt kicks it away, and, seeing the situation as being utterly hopeless, someone lets out that Anti-Doctor is actually future Eight. Eight is shocked, Eight regenerates
Hurt lets out a throaty ""NOOOOoooo..."" and disappears in a puff of plot resolution. The walls begin to crumble, but it's just worked in from old footage- Eccleston hasn't reprised his role.

The Silence, the fact they're called *the sentinels of history* gives the impression that they watch over time, they guard the fabric of the space-time continuum; by what it seems, the way they wish to protect time is to stop The Doctor from reaching Trenzalore - To protect time. Even Dorium states that The Doctor has had a dangerous past, but his *future is infinitely more terrifying*.

""*Silence must fall when the question is asked*""
The answer to the question is The Doctor's name, it's something hidden behind the name. Something so dark that it may possibly break time - what The Silence are protecting at all cost. Hell, even Churchill in the aborted timeline states that if there was a terrible secret that had to be hidden forever - The best course of mind would be to kill the man. The Silence may not exactly want to kill The Doctor just because, I believe that if anything, they wish to kill him for the mercy of the universe - By killing The Doctor he can't visit Trenzalore and reveal the secret that may drastically change everything the universe has came to love

Even the [music](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5D-QPDGhCtM) exudes heroism and grandeur.

Sometimes this can be fun.  I admit



The writers get too caught up in trying to create great tales of heroism, because it feels like so much effort is put into making them ridiculously epic, that important things, like satisfying plot resolutions, are consistently overlooked.  It feels like every series tries to 1-up the last in the 'oh-my-god-we-are-so-dead' department.  


I imagine the monologue taking place in Russel T Davies head as he thought out the plot arc for series 1 and 2 went something along the lines of: *""What's more deadly than 1 dalek?  An invasion with LOADS of daleks.  What's more deadly than loads of daleks? An invasion of LOADS of daleks AND cybermen.""*

I won't even bother to comment upon the naff music in the background, or the fact he's talking to a giant fiery pumpkin - just watch it.



So what do I like?  I know the episode has already achieved a God-like status here, atmospheric, with well integrated [emotional scenes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACN8G6FDO0E) that don't obstruct the flow of narrative.  Similarly, 'The Empty Child' and 'The Doctor Dances' are concept driven episodes, in which Moffat successfully strikes a balance between having the Doctor be a very charismatic and likeable protagonist without it seeming like the episode was created as a tribute to his awesomeness.

For me, and you get the impression that, because of her looks, she has never been taken seriously in her entire life and has been told that she can't possibly be smart. The crew are constantly belittling her and treating her as 'just a pretty face', which is a role she has accepted. She obviously believes them when they tell/treat her as if she is stupid and her opinions don't matter until she is saved by CAL and is changed by the transcription error I think the fact that Moffat chose to include a physical distortion in that transcription error speaks volumes of how much value society puts on looks/exterior value, especially for women. When she tells Donna,  ""I have the two qualities you require to see absolute truth: I am brilliant. And unloved."" the idea is that she is unloved because she has lost her value as a woman(person) in society because she is now ugly. This one sentence also speaks to the idea of conflict between societal norms and the idea of moral truth: the two shall never co-exist.

On the episodes that did show, however, there was hints that the Doctor was ""more than just another Time Lord"", even going so far as to have the Doctor slip up and say ""**we** had trouble with the prototype (with the Hand of Omega)"",  in *Remembrance of the Daleks*. The plan was to exentually reveal that The Doctor was with Rassilon and Omega

This in itself answers several questions from the classic series: The ""other Doctors"" from the mind war sequence in *Brain of Morbeus*, and, of course, the aforementioned hints in the Seventh Doctor's run.

With the Cartmel Masterplan in mind, but I could be wrong). As a result, The Other changes himself to become The Doctor and flees Gallifrey to escape the Time Lords (the whole ""you've been running your whole life"" bit in virtually every Stefan Moffat episodes, but most notably in *The Wedding of River Song*). What he did (which involves stopping Rassilon and Omega), he did in the name of The Other, not in the name of The Doctor.

Also, I've chosen to ignore the parts involving the non-canon realizations of the Masterplan, as well as the parts with Ace)

Any thoughts? I feel like this theory has the most to back it up

We want to welcome all of our new subscribers and give a big Thank You to our older members for making /r/Gallifrey as great as it is. 

And with this new surge in subscribers it seems like now is a good time to go over some of the rules and policies here

---

####Spoiler Policy/Link Flairs or the 'why isn't my post showing up?' section:

* **Spoiler Policy**

    The spoiler policy here in /r/Gallifrey is

    A spoiler for this subreddit is, shooting locations are spoilers. Stating who the protagonist of a future episode is in the title is a spoiler.  
   
    Examples. If there is a rumor that the T.A.R.D.I.S it is getting a makeover, non-spoiler title is what we are asking for. ""What do you think of the new T.A.R.D.I.S design"", bad title. ""What do you think of the new set changes? [spoilers]"", good title. If a location shot is leaked for a future episode, don't title the post ""The Daleks on the set of the season premier!"". 
    
    *If your post title contains spoilers, non-spoiler title.*

      As for comments, do not open those posts.

   If the topic of the post is about a new set design and is marked [Spoiler]

    The moderators understand that certain news items, it just allows people the ability to not be spoiled by titles.

    We really do want to have a light spoiler policy here


* **Link Flairs/Filtering**

    All posts are given link flairs by the mods to help identify whether or not they will contain some degree of spoilers. 

    These link flairs are used for our filtering options listed in the sidebar. (Please note because not all mobile users can see these tags we ask that you continue to mark your post with [Spoiler] in the title if it contains spoilers.)

    The filters in the sidebar give people the option to hide, we put the tag system into place but it is on you to use the filters. If you want to be as spoiler free as possible we recommend unsubbing from /r/Gallifrey and bookmarking one of these filters. The degree to how much you want to show or hide is up to you. 

    For way more detail about the specific link flairs and filters [here is the post](http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/1fhqnu/new_features_now_available_in_gallifrey_filtering/) explaining them.

* **""Why is my post not showing up?""**


   Lately we have been getting more people wondering why their posts are not appearing after they have been submitted. This normally happens for three reason. 

    1) Your title contained a spoiler and was removed by a moderator.

    2) It was caught in the reddit spam filter.

    3) And the most likely reason; it has not been tagged yet by a moderator:

    The filter/flair system is setup so the default viewing of /r/Gallifrey will not display posts until they have been tagged by a moderator. We have this in place due to people purposely trying to post spoilers in titles to troll the subreddit. (For those new here

    To verify that your post has been submitted and not removed by a mod or stuck in the spam fitler

###Respect

* **/r/Gallifrey is meant to be a place for friendly

    The rules for respect, against others member here are not allowed. If you cannot maintain civility, the moderators will issue a warning. If the behavior continues, a ban will result. This includes sending PM's.

* **Please use the downvote with careful and deliberate discretion.**

    Downvotes are not for disagreeing or for topics you are not interested in. A subreddit specially for discussion has little use for downvoting if the post or comment adds to the discussion. If a post is not relevant, or have seen the topic far too often, it does not mean it should be downvoted. Too often for this subreddit, posts are downvoted for being an unpopular opinion or because people feel it was a not well thought-out post.

    One reason downvoting is not a good thing here, a one-off joke or meme or just a link to a reaction gif, those are what are not relevant to this subreddit.

    We should be encouraging discussions and discouraging puns and jokes

###A few small announcements:

1368964354.0,1emkno,Theory on The Name of The Doctor[Spoilers],dibidi,94,20,86,"*Caveat: I've only watched all the episodes of the revived series

Okay

1. John Hurt is an incarnation of the Doctor
2. John Hurt committed an act so terrible that he does not deserve the title of ""Doctor"" anymore.
3. Clara never saw John Hurt
4. The name you choose is a promise you make.

**So first question

The most popular rumor (and possible leak) is that Hurt is an incarnation in between McGann and Eccleston. However, any and all future incarnations of the doctor (including Eccleston, Tennant, and Smith) cannot be called Doctor anymore. The name you choose is a promise, and promises don't reset themselves once you regenerate, you're still the same person.

Remember also, he cannot call himself the Doctor anymore.

Ergo, and because promises cannot be reset, cannot possibly be a prior incarnation of the Doctor. He's a future incarnation, possibly the Valeyard because of the callback this episode, or possibly also the Final Incarnation.

**Second question

Simple. The Doctor has met this future incarnation before.

We all know that's certainly possible. The Doctor has met his previous/future (depending on which doctor) incarnations before; and we all know

**Third question

When the Great Intelligence entered the Doctor's time stream, not his future ones. So when the Great Intelligence entered the time stream to enact this plan, the time stream was effectively cut short up to the present Doctor. 

Ergo when Clara jumps in to save the Doctor

**Fourth Question

My guess is that John Hurt was also involved in the Time War and met the 8th Doctor during those events. Remember

**Fifth Question

The popular theory is that John Hurt was the one that created the Moment which resulted in the Time Lock and ended the Time War. However, 10th, and I think even the 11th Doctor already mentioned that they did not regret their decision (and in 10's case, he made that decision again during ""The End of Time""). So that particular action therefore does not deserve the title of Doctor being revoked.

My guess is that John Hurt was instrumental in advising and/or creating the Ultimate Sanction that Rassilon was planning to use to win the Time War, that would stop the Time War but not destroy the universe.

This also explains why the Doctor gets so mad everytime he sees his own future, he knows that some day, somehow he **will** be that person...

1365364644.0,1bvbkt,[Spoilers TRoA] Some thoughts about suspension of disbelief in Doctor Who,russellsprouts,92,17,23,"Reading the discussions people have had about the Rings of Akhenetan

**About the Seven Worlds and Rings of Akhenetan:**

They are obviously a highly advanced society, since the Doctor and Clara were able to breath between the rocks in the ring, that there was air all around them. 
See Niven's The Integral Trees for an imagined world that consists of a ""Smoke Ring"" of gas orbiting a neutron star at such a distance that their is a breathable atmosphere and normal temperatures. This is a hard sci-fi story.

Obviously Doctor Who is not hard sci-fi, and the planets could act as keepers of the ring, as Saturn's moons do. It would be slightly unstable, but there are many ways it could work. Perhaps instability caused one or more of the planets to collide, creating the ring in the first place.

It is also possible that the seven worlds are moons of a gas giant in a further orbit. Heat from the gas giant would make it livable.

It reminds me of the Xindi in Star Trek Enterprise. In this

Perhaps in the past this happened to Ahkenaten's species. They evolved on one planet (perhaps only one was intelligent, their homeworld is destroyed, and they escape to the other worlds in the system. In fact, the destruction of their world would be a good reason for the intelligent species to experiment with genetic engineering.  They could create beings to live on other worlds, and having other intelligent species with different capabilities could be helpful on worlds that were dissimilar to their own. Perhaps all of the species were originally the same, but have been engineered and have diverged over many, many years.

Since then, but it could happen, even in a hard sci-fi universe, with some tweaks and a lot of backstory and explanation.

**About Doctor Who in General:**

The point is, Doctor Who isn't about the science or explanations. Star Trek is much more, because their stated purpose is to seek out new life on a scientific exploration mission.

The difference between Star Trek and Doctor Who is the focus, and frequently, experts from around the Federation have important roles in episodes. There are episodes with Warp field specialists and genetics specialists just about every season. It makes a point that the universe can be explained. There are interesting things out there, and we will be able to explain them someday. The show is an optimistic view of the future, where humans take their place in a wider interstellar community, founded on scientific and humanist (sapient-ist?) ideals.

The Doctor Who is about a Timelord. Their society was so advanced that compared to us they are post-science. [Clarke's Third Law](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClarkesThirdLaw) applies to them. The Timelords waged war such that lesser species did not know, but would rather just appreciate it, rather than trivialize the accomplishments and/or traditions of the other species. Why else would he be so excited about humans? He loves to watch the human's accomplishments. He visits the first human colony on Mars as a big fan. He loves to show his companions the extent that humans will reach. He loves humans, because they show him that even the ""lesser"" species, with primitive technology are worth saving and their accomplishments are worth celebrating. He needs them because his companions are the ones that keep him in check. The keep him from being the vengeful god he could be, a vengeful god like the sun in the system of TRoA.

So yes, but they shouldn't spend time doing that. With a few allowance for psychic stuff and visual effects, like pieces of the ring appearing so close together and magical artificial gravity, something that no TV series I have ever seen treats realistically, the world we are shown could be hard sci-fi. The hardest thing to explain would be the Tardis, something that people accept in every episode. The show just leaves that for you to figure out. The Doctor doesn't much care about the way other place's technology works, and it would be too difficult for him to explain to humans anyway. He just wants to show them the wonders of the universe.

I should preface this with Rose Tyler is my favorite companion. This much will be obvious in the following paragraphs. I posted this to r/doctorwho to find out why most people on that subreddit hate Rose. I thought you might appreciate the 'defense' part of that post. So here is why I love Rose. 
.

I can understand why she is not a favorite; she comes off as clingy
The Doctor was broken. He had just come from the time war and was absolutely grief-stricken. Rose fixed him. She made him better because of how stunningly caring and human she was. He needed her. She was the one person who could fix him. 
 

Rose doesn’t just stand around, she saved her father’s life because she couldn't let him die. But she gave him up in the end to make things right.


 Rose Tyler is brave. Fucking crazy brave. She’s encountered some of the scariest things in the universe, Cybermen, Sycorax, and a Werewolf just to name a few. Rose Tyler defeated Satan. It doesn’t get much braver than that.


 She fell in love with the most powerful man in the universe and he fell in love with her right back. Her love made him want to live and his love made her realize who she could be.


 She is the Bad Wolf. She came back for the Doctor. She took all the power in the universe inside of her and used it to take down the Dalek empire and save the world. She traveled through the void. She walked alone through lord knows how many different universes to save them all and find the Doctor. Who knows how many lives she saved and how many horrors she encountered by herself. 
Rose Tyler is a regular girl who became extraordinary. She was not rude. She was not annoying. She was brave and strong and caring and Human. She is the Only person in existence to show mercy for a Dalek. [Interesting character foil


She brought the Doctor out of the darkness that was the time war so he could be here today

I would say mine is that most of the things we saw in the Tenth Doctor's tenure - his love for Rose, they're not reflective of the man in his entirety. In other words, if it was any other Doctor standing in Bad Wolf Bay in ""Doomsday"", they might have outright told Rose that they couldn't love her in return; if it was any other Doctor in *The End of Time*, they would have faced their regeneration square in the eye and said ""Bring it on.""

So far

This seems unlikely as:

* That's already the storyline River's been given.
* Why would the Doctor either travel with someone he knows he'll have to take back to their death (note that he doesn't travel with River - she just keeps turning up)
* Oswin's full name is Oswin Oswald. The companion is named Clara. They are *different people*.

I think even the most die-hard Moffat critic would admit that he'd be a colossal moron to reuse something from the last two series.

This means she is also not:

* A ganger clone.
* A Teselecta pretending to be a Dalek (???)
* A Timelord (or just ""Timelord-esque"")

About the only original idea I've seen is her reappearing as a Dalek and using a perception filter to appear human. Bust as interesting/bizarre as that would be

---

I'll admit that I have no better suggestion (the best I've managed is ""quantum entanglement

There's a few things I think are important:

* The Doctor never saw Oswin in human form
* Moffat has said [that the Ponds leaving will be ""tragic""
* Oswin's ""remember"" line and look to the audience. Is this purely ""only you've seen me
* I think that the Dalek memory loss is the crux of why any ""changing time"" theory doesn't pan out. The Doctor wants this

I just wanted it to be it's own thread. I've always believed that in his room

At this point we only know that the Doctor knows when and where he is going to die, River."" knowing it would be her. 

When he says ""who else?"" he was confirming his suspicion that her stopping his death in Lets Kill Hitler was too easy

At this point he knew that she was in Stormcage for murder

As he goes on his farewell tour he is searching as to why he needs to die, but by the end of the episode he knows the fixed point is nearing. By the beginning of the Wedding of River Song, he is resilient and trying to fight back, but with the Death of the Brigadier, he knows it's his time and basically gives up fighting death. 

UNTIL! he delivers the letters to the Tessalecta and suddenly remembers the full capabilities of the machine. The Doctor's mind turns and his loophole is found. He ""dressed for the occasion"" and he survived.

I work in a Korean middle school and am currently re-watching a lot of Series 4 with my students (who have never heard of Dr Who but go funking mental for it like you wouldn't believe). Recently we watched Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead and it struck me how super depressing River's death and and the Dr's 'saving' her is

1) The library has been sealed for 100 years since the Vashta Nerada (sp?) hatched but Charlotte hasn't aged at all, or until the computer fails? That's pretty depressing in itself. The library's lightbulbs will burn out the sun, will the computer do the same? Bloody hell, that's a long time.

2) This whole plan was kept a secret from her (fair enough

3) Everything seems to suggest that the Dr is the absolute most important thing in River's life

4) She's totally aware before she sacrifices herself that the Library patrons are trapped inside a virtual world overseen by CAL and the Dr Moon, as mentioned earlier.
5) Charlotte Lux thought she might be lonely

6) If I remember rightly, and isn't that a bit creepy?

7) River Song just doesn't seem like the kind of woman who would want to spend forever looking after 3 children in a lovely white dress, cruel and completely against what her character would want. Whenever I see her in a later episode I can't help but be sad.

8) There are loads more reasons why I don't like this ending but I won't go on and on. 

What do other people think? I'd love to hear a positive spin on the ending so that I could feel better about it!

1358824568.0,1716op,Regenerating the Eighth Doctor - An Argument Against,Philomathematic,81,8,37,"I haven’t seen anything on this recently, finally. (Almost the exact same arguments can be marshaled for Chris Eccleston’s participation in the 50th anniversary) Like I said

My main argument against showing anything to do with the Time War is pretty conventional – it could never live up to our expectations, but in this case I think we keep the mystery going by telling only a little and showing nothing at all. It’s like the shark in *Jaws* or the alien in *Alien*, it’s all the more impressive for only getting little peeks at what it is, never the thing itself. But even more so. For anyone who follows *Sherlock* (and I suspect that may be a respectable number of people here), that was one of my complaints with the treatment of [Sherlock Spoiler](#s *The Hounds of Baskerville*, the poorly-done CGI dog at the end. It would’ve been much more effective to keep the dog entirely offscreen and not show us what the characters were hallucinating. So think of the Time War like the dog, except on a much larger scale.) Alternately

So that’s my case against the Time War. But even supposing we could be permitted just a peek into the final moments of the war, but for different reasons.

To begin with,” since it didn’t happen that way in at least three instances. Working backwards, we have Eight to Nine, but also Six to Seven (in which a regeneration scene was filmed, but it’s not Colin Baker turning into Sylvester McCoy), and Two to Three.

The lack of continuity between the Second and Third Doctors is probably the most relevant instance for this argument. Does anyone feel cheated that we didn’t get to see Troughton become Pertwee onscreen? Or, would it make a difference? Those aren’t just rhetorical questions – if there actually are people upset over the non-existence of this scene, I don’t know of them but would like to. But I think that the regeneration of Seven to Eight is also relevant here. In a nice nod to the classic series and incumbent Doctor, McCoy got invited back to do the first ten or fifteen minutes of the movie and then hand things off to McGann. It was a nice gesture, but I’d argue that it didn’t add enough to be worth it other than for sentimental reasons. If anything, I expect that it would’ve confused audiences unfamiliar with the show – the main character dies in the first ten or fifteen minutes, after all! It’s literally meeting the Doctor just before he dies and regenerates – “What just happened?” is the much more pressing question of “What happens now?” for people unfamiliar with how Time Lords work

So along similar lines, but still feel it’s not necessary for the same reason it’s not necessary to have seen Troughton become Pertwee. What would it add?

What it would add, because almost nobody wastes their final moments doing something frivolous – no, you do what’s important to you, and so showing off a regeneration scene would be that memorable last impression of that particular incarnation of the Doctor. Sort of how people love the “You were fantastic… and you know what? So was I” speech by the Ninth Doctor at the end of his run.

However, and why I think it’s aesthetically appropriate not to show the regeneration.

In “The Forgotten” (comic; haven’t read, he died alone. Although having the Doctor say this in a comic book isn’t as “this is definitely how it happened” as it would be for him to say it onscreen, it’s good enough for me. Now, this is a bit of a jump, but think about the episode *Blink* for a minute. Of the many things that made that particular episode brilliant, how the camera was used was one of the most brilliant. The Angels can’t move if someone is looking, and even if none of the characters were looking, because something about seeing the Angels move on-camera was just wrong. It’s that little meta-nod to the audience

So jumping back to how this relates to the Eighth Doctor’s regeneration into the Ninth

So! Those are my arguments. What do people think? Have I missed something or do you have an answer for any of the questions I posed? What could be a good reason for needing to see the regeneration sequence from Eight to Nine?",,t5_2tf29,1364088123.0,h,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/1716op/regenerating_the_eighth_doctor_an_argument_against/

    7.11 - Journey to the Center of the TARDIS

    7.13 - The Last Cyberman

Clara is summoned to an impossible conference call, leading him toward the one place in all of time and space that he should never go. It’s a deadly trap that threatens to unravel his past, present and future...

What can you tell us about the finale?

Moffatt: It’s full of surprises and questions that have never been answered in the history of Who, it’s actually going to happen. The episode is called The Name Of The Doctor and involves our hero in a conflict that is very, very personal to him. Usually he’s saving other people, but this time he might be the one who needs to be saved. We’ll also find out what makes his new companion so impossible and there’s a surprise that no one has got right so far, and one that will change the course of Who forever!

Having had three official introductions as a Dalek
Jenna: All I can say is that Clara hasn’t just met the Doctor three times before...

~~~~~~

So, ordinary people can become extraordinary when traveling with the Doctor. 

Clara has saved the day in nearly every episode she has been in. In the finale

Time in DW isn't linear, thus the essence which is Clara has met the Doctor any number of times. She could meet future Doctors and past Doctors, but for some reason, the Doctor can't remember.

Think about the repeated phrase - ""Run you clever boy, and it's out of context in TBOSJ. The message has a meaning, and I think she's trying to get him to run from something, to save himself, and it will only occur if he remembers something he has forgotten.

Moffat says the Doctor needs to be saved. I think Clara is the one saving him

McCoy’s house was a small thing at the top of a hill; its occupants were on vacation. All he had for company was a cat. He told us about how he went down and hitchhiked to the bar. A man with a thin yet extremely long beard picked him up and before McCoy could enter the bar, it turns out people had been freaking out because they couldn’t find him. Crew members and set people had been running all over. *Get the helicopter!*

Originally The Hobbit was planned on being split into two parts

**In General** McCoy talked about how he met my uncle- at a horror convention, how Big Finish audios now air on the radio (something Americans don’t really do anymore, dramas that is).
I told McCoy about how I got into the radio dramas because I was interested in Davros. He said to me, favorite villain.” In response to my flattery, “Oh, well that makes up for it!”

 What’s best- he played the spoons and a song for us and then graciously **signed a bunch of photos and took pictures with us.**

At this point I was the center of attention. Modesty aside

**But here’s my favorite part**. I stood up next to McCoy for a picture, ecstatic that this was actually happening. I was holding it together nicely enough. But right before the picture was taken, I heard Sylvester McCoy’s voice in my right ear. In a near whisper and low voice like that of the Doctor’s I heard him say: *""TARDIS.""*

And I lost it. The camera flashed and now I have a picture of my stupid face all scrunched up funny because I doubled over right after the picture, got permission to post the video, said thank you and left. Along with everyone else, including McCoy. It was 9pm.

Recently in *Journey to the Centre of the TARDIS* we saw The Doctor make a personal delivery of an artifact because the previous attempt to deliver the BFB didn't succeed


Both these seem examples of ""Ground Hog Day"" style time loops that are only broken when an unsatisfactory outcome serves as a lesson to The Doctor to change his method

It raises these questions in my mind:
(1) Was there a ""first iteration"" of Forest of the Dead where the Doctor didn't give River the screwdriver, then a different (successful) approach at the end.

(2) or does the Doctor always give River a hacked sonic screwdriver? I.e. the knowledge to save River's ""matrix"" is always applied and he never experienced the permanent loss associated with her sacrifice?



The reason I ask for your opinion is that there is something very sad about the idea that there is a time stream that The Doctor may remember where he doesn't save River. If this first iteration of the sequence ends without River being saved then The Doctor will have actually seen her sacrifice herself to save the day.

What do you think happened first time around? Did River turn up without a screwdriver? How would the first iteration of the story been affected?

Oh - and how is River's diary in the data core for her to read again?

Oh - and is this the first reference to the Doctor and companions always  *running*?

So the question for you all is this: **what is the most horrible death you have seen in *Doctor Who*?** 

For me

This would be the execution of the nameless old man in the Seventh Doctor's episode 'The Happiness Patrol'. For those who haven't made it to the classics yet, boiling solution of melted candy mixture, drowning the man (and most likely melting some insides too). This was a very shocking death because of three things: the lack of dignity, the pain involved, and the sadistic mind behind it all. 

Helen A. was a brillaint villainess and the delight she showed in the execution really showed the superficiality of her emotion. In trying to create a happy society, bright obtrusive colours and seriously *annoying* lift music, the only happiness was that shown out of fear and repression.

Sadly, it's a little over the top, but it's supposed to be. With the painful deaths and merciless repression combined with the childlike imagery of the Kandyman, you actually have a very dark story at core, full of political imagery and warped ideas.

The goal of this is to hopefully curtail and minimize the effects of bandwagon voting, comments tend to illicit a knee-jerk vote from people, subconsciously suggesting that the post is better or worse simply because of its score. We know that's not necessarily the case, but it is true that a top comment after the first hour is likely to remain the top comment for the duration of the post, whether higher quality submissions come in after it or not.

As opposed to 'contest mode' which randomized the sorting and obscured child comments

Ideally this will level the playing field for the first little while of the post few new comments being submitted

The scores may be hidden anywhere from 1 minute to 24 hours

Sorting follows how you have it selected (new/controversial/best/top)

1 - These are happening on self-posts that are opinions/discussions. If you don't agree with an opinion you shouldn't be downvoting it. It goes against [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette) and discourages open dialog. 

2 - As a smaller subreddit downvotes pull the topic off peoples front page quicker because of the low upvote count. Two posts were made in the last two days that didn't show up on our front page because of just one or two downvotes.  Both these posts got people talking

3 - Some might be thinking it's reddits algorithm adding downvotes but these have been happening more often and too quickly lately. And its not just one or two downvotes.

Later we see a lot of these same tropes with Rory. The difference being, or the show's. The initial episodes make fun of Rory, for his looks and his lack of confidence, and that is a bit cruel -- to have that character later become so central makes the early appearances even more cringe-inducing.

We do hear more about the Doctor's treatment of Martha. But to be fair, she insists on being upgraded from ""passenger"" to ""companion"" if she comes on more adventures, and is so ready for rejection that she sees it when it isn't even there. There are the well-known examples of Martha ""getting a job"" to support the Doctor in Blink (mentioned only in passing) and the Doctor subjecting her to bigotry and prejudice (including his own, ugh) in the Human Nature double-ep (neat fact about those episodes -- humanity is the bad guy. After I realized that they made way more sense. I could do a whole other post on this but brevity wit etc). Not to mention the finale. But really, those larger issues bother me less than the smaller ways he shows his lack of consideration for her, that he simply doesn't put much thought into her well-being beyond basic safety. 

I'm going to go ahead and include the Ood here. Include the Ood. Incluuuuude the Oooooood. Okay I'm done. The first time we see them, and Donna calls the Doctor out on that very issue, which I find very telling (yeah okay I love Donna).

OKAY so, and sometimes, a douche. My problem is that it never really gets addressed, or warned against, or comes back to bite him in the ass in some clever way, or any of the other things that usually happen to the hero when he's a jackass. And it's not even presented as something worthy of negative consequences, which I find a bit surreal (I think the term for it might be moral dissonance?) on a show I can usually relate to. So...

They got married because River wouldn't let him go back to the fixed point. You have to understand that River was programed to be obsessed with the Doctor

(The Wedding of River Song) RIVER: It was such a basic mistake, raise her into a perfect psychopath, introduce her to the Doctor. Who else was I going to fall in love with?

....... HOWEVER, the point in HIS time line he first meets River) she knows his actual name, meaning they are by that point in HER time line married in all sense of the Galifreyan/Timelord meaning for marriage- she knows his true name. So while he knows its inevitable since he and she are in a paradox, he is not ready for that level of commitment yet- after all, still early for their relationship in the timeline, and lets face it- the doctor doesn't do domestic.

RIVER: Am I the woman who marries you

DOCTOR: Oh! I don't want to marry you.

RIVER: I don't want to murder you.

....... SO by this point the universe if on the brink of falling apart

DOCTOR: River

RIVER: I can't let you die.

DOCTOR: But I have to die.

RIVER: Shut up! I can't let you die without knowing you are loved by so many

DOCTOR: River

RIVER: I'll suffer if I have to kill you.

DOCTOR: More than every living thing in the universe?!

RIVER: Yes.

......... RULE number 1 the doctor lies- so we have this 'wedding' which for in all intents and purposes follows some Galifreyan traditions -the wrapping of the hands with one cloth- assumable representing the joining of one time line and life, they are not Really married (at least not yet in the series since we do know for a fact they do finalize tying the knot since River in the library knows his name)

DOCTOR: Now, and you have to remember it very, very carefully and tell no-one what I said. [The DOCTOR whispers in RIVER’S ear] I just told you my name. Now there you go, River Song. Melody Pond. You're the woman who married me. And wife, I have a request. This world is dying, and it's my fault, and I can't bear it another day. Please

They kiss time moves on

So My question- will we get to see this turning point at all with him and River where he really does marry her (since we know as a fixed point he must since she knows his name in the library) and if so how/when do you think it'll happen?

TLDR: The doctor and river don't REALLY get married in 'The Wedding of River Song' it was a Doctor's ruse to get a woman holding the universe's safety hostage for the love of a man and not wanting to kill him. He never gave her his name


[[EDIT// Adding supporting evidence that River will know his name and that its tied to marriage]]

""When a good man goes to war"" 

RIVER: (lightly) Oh

DOCTOR: No

RIVER: (takes his hand) I am telling you. (holds his hand on the cot) Can't you read?

The DOCTOR looks at the Gallifreyan writing on the cot and then up at RIVER. He suddenly realizes who she is and smiles.

DOCTOR: Hello.

RIVER: Hello.

DOCTOR: (laughs nervously) But... but that means...

RIVER: I'm afraid it does.

DOCTOR: (looks at AMY and RORY) Ooh! But you and I, we, er... (kisses the air)

RIVER: Yes.

I developed this idea when ruminating on the show's many similarities to the show Avatar The Last Airbender. In this show there is a nearly season-long arc in which the main character Aang is separated from the giant sky-bison Appa who has been his dutiful steed and closest friend throughout the series.

This event radically changed the dynamic of the show and greatly tried the main character. I believe that a similar application to the Doctor and the TARDIS could bring out some equally interesting if not surpassingly entertaining material and would do wonders to really testing the Doctor's character.

You see, getting his fingers into some mystery or adventure, but he never truly gets involved with his surroundings and never really attaches him to somewhere.

So much is said of the Doctor being god-like and being lauded as such a powerfully amazing man free from the shackles of space and time but all of that power really is the TARDIS. Alone from that

Basically, actually, [once](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/The_War_Games) on screen and [once](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/The_Night_Walkers_%28comic_story%29) in what's now a really, really obscure comic), we never actually see Troughton complete his transformation into Pertwee, and owing to a couple of inconsistencies in some of the multi-Doctor specials, there's evidence that there must have been a gap between the end of *The War Games* and the Third Doctor stumbling out of the TARDIS in *Spearhead from Space*. There's a bunch of extended universe stuff that takes place in this period

It's all a bit arcane, Paul Cornell (one of the guys who first made a big deal of the inconsistencies) has been a scriptwriter for the revived series, and Terrence Dicks- the writer of a lot of the Classic episodes the Season 6b theory is based on- has officially [endorsed](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Season_6b#Established_as_narrative_fact) it and used it in some of his Second Doctor Novels. 


So at any rate

 HurtDoc could fit in there pretty easily.  He could have been a failed attempt by the Doctor to escape or subvert the CIA (or at least deal with them on his own terms), after all, and perhaps he took things farther than even his controllers were comfortable with, or went rogue and posed a very real danger to them and/or the universe at large. 

All that said, 6b is a pretty damn obscure bit of Whoviana, and without the extended universe stuff (which, IIRC, the BBC isn't supposed to reference too blatantly), the whole thing relies on the nit-picking of throwaway lines from decades ago. It'd require an awful lot of clever writing explain to all but the most attentive fans of Classic Who what the hell is going on and why they should care without bogging down the plot.

I briefly worked in a private psychiatric institution during the summer of 1962 and I can vividly recall this so called ""Doctor"". He was the last patient to be admitted into our facility. The man was obviously delusional, a number of strange “incidents” had stirred up the patients and we, the staff, openly feared a mass breakout attempt. Violent confrontations between the staff and their wards were increasing daily. This “Doctor” only succeeded in making a bad situation worse. We would often find him wandering the corridors or searching through the staff quarters at night, despite the fact that we sedated him and placed him in a securely locked cell after his evening meal each day. How he escaped from him cell and evaded our security guards each night, I will never know. After only one week of incarceration, he vanished. I have no idea how he escaped our hospital, and a mysterious fire that destroyed Dr. Drake’s private quarters and laboratory that same night. We never had time to recapture this “Doctor” - and I never found any answers to my questions - because, beware this “Doctor.”

The Doctor technically *has* changed his ethnicity several times. It's all been Caucasian but it has happened. Even the fact that Eccleston was using a northern accent instead of RP was a pretty forward step in who was playing the Doctor.

Rumors of actors like [Paterson Joseph](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paterson_Joseph) and [Chiwetel Ejiofor](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0252230/) taking the role of the Eleventh Doctor are reported with honest legitimacy and the issue of race is becoming less and less divisive in society.

Just a headstart: I'm about to get carried away.

**The Doctor Who story I always wanted to tell.**

I never wrote or read any sort of fan fiction. That does not mean I've never daydreamed of writing a Doctor Who story myself. Actually, and why they have never appeared since.

On my musings I always assume the Reapers were created during the Time War, I imagine it as the timey-wimey-est thing of all. The Daleks might have at some point become immense paradoxes for some reason or other, and what the Time Lords did was set the Reapers loose on them, while developing some sort of protection for themselves. Maybe what the Doctor did to end the war was simply find a way to allow the Reapers to erase everyone, Dalek and Time War alike, from the face of history. Anyway, this is not the point. I digress.

What *The Impossible Mug* would be about is what happened to the Reapers. Why did they never show up again? Well

This would most likely be the Tenth Doctor, to break the rules of the Time Lords and change his future, even though it had already become a fixed point in time.

In 19XX England, and picks up a mug that was left there by the old inhabitants. An empty, white, featureless coffee mug. He puts it inside the TARDIS, and then he travels back half an hour into the past. He lands in the exact same house, the exact same spot, and the mug is still there

Except the Doctor doesn't leave it there. He throws it to the ground and it breaks into hundreds of tiny white pieces, white, featureless, even though it had just broken to hundres of pieces half an hour ago. A perfect, if small, paradox. 

Reapers feed on ruptured fixed points in time. When Rose saves her father from dying when he *should* have died

But the Doctor knows where to find them. They live in the Time Vortex, he catches the impossible mug and waves it around in the air, shouting for the Reapers to come and grab a bite.

And come they do. With all Time Lords dead, not enough, not for a race that was created during a time where paradoxes were an everyday ocurrance. So they come, lured by the delicious, sweet and, most of all, *impossible* mug that the Doctor holds in his hand.

As the Reapers approach the TARDIS through the time vortex, passing hallways and doors and libraries and swimming pools and wardrobes and Zero Rooms, until he gets where he wanted to: a big, big, empty room. He puts the mug in the ground and gently kicks it forward. He steps aside, watching as all of the Reapers enter the empty room and quickly devour the mug.

But not quick enough. The Doctor closes the door on them, and old walls are impassable barriers for the Reapers. And then, the Doctor gets back to the control room, where he burns up every hallway that lead to the Hall of the Reapers, where they are now trapped forever.

The Doctor believes he was won. There are no Time Lords to enforce the old rules anymore; there are no Reapers to feed on the paradoxes anymore. He can do it, terribly wrong he was.

**And what has all of this made-up crap got to do with this week's ""Next Time""?**

Well, you're gonna tell me what they are!"", we see through the eyes of some creature who growls, and who sees things in a weird, distorted fashion. Much like the Reaper's in *Father's Day* did. And they live inside the TARDIS! Seeing this got my heart pumped, even more than it was already pumped after such a fabulous episode.

Expanding that theory

So that's my theory what do you think. I hope this hasn't been discussed here...

BTW: While I'm at it, a Statue of Liberty crashing down on the street is probably making a loud noise.

The infertility isn't sexist because it's Amy herself who thought she was worth less because she was infertile. The show wasn't sending out a message that all women were worth less

Now, and general breakup from lifestyle differences just isn't dramatic enough. Infertility is dramatic. (That's also why the bridal-style carry of Amy by the Doctor isn't sexist- it's just for drama).

1359446044.0,17hiqz,The moment a companion clicks.,Sumjin,72,13,39,"Doctor Who is a relationship between the characters and the viewer.

This statement has been and continues to be the best way I can describe what it's like watching Doctor Who to people who haven't watched the show. The attachment and emotions you feel towards the characters are unlike anything else on television which in turn only makes it that much more painful when companions and doctors are taken from us. While I think each Doctor has a number of defining moments in their time I would like to look at and talk about special moments we experience with each companion.

When looking back at the companions and the Doctors I see myself as the overprotective helicopter parent^[1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter_parent) meeting my child (the doctor)'s date (the companion) for the first time. I initially think that this person isn't nearly good enough for my doctor and then wonder why my doctor couldn't have stayed with their last significant other (the last companion) because I'd grown to like them so much

Metaphors aside, but they're perfect for the doctor at this stage in his life and I as a viewer finally see that and accept it.

Now on to the companions....
(I've only seen the post 2005 series so that's all I can really offer)

**Rose**

*The End of the World*

""The end of the Earth. It's gone. We were too busy saving ourselves. No one saw it go. All those years

Up until now we've had crazy space dude and silly earth girl on their wacky adventures


**Martha**

*Last of the Time Lords*

""I traveled across the world. From the ruins of New York, living as slaves! But if Martha Jones became a legend then that's wrong, because my name isn't important. There's someone else. The man who sent me out there, the man who told me to walk the Earth. And his name is The Doctor. He has saved your lives so many times and you never even knew he was there. He never stops. He never stays. He never asks to be thanked. But I've seen him, I know him... I love him... And I know what he can do.""

Oh Martha, it's about the doctor and it always has been.


**Donna**

*Planet of the Ood*

""You idiot! They’re born with their brain in their hands

This is the one that made me write this post, the doctor because he was so used to getting his way and was losing sight of himself and we the viewers because we'd grown so attached to Ten that we were overlooking his faults. (Just imagine how Waters of Mars would have gone if Donna were there to keep him in line)


**Amy**

*The Best Below*

""What if you were really old, and that kind, and the very last of your kind, you couldn't just stand there and watch children cry. ""

Well, what makes her so important in relation to Eleven? Why her? I thought her first reference to children crying set this moment up perfectly to establish Amy as the Doctor's moral compass to guide him through his own hubris. Eleven showed up loud and sure of himself, but  when he was faced with the difficult decision of taking a life he needed someone to make him think and see beyond the straightforward solutions. Amy won me over from the start, but I wasn't ready to accept her for my doctor until this moment when she shows what he would be without her.

When the Doctor asks Rory if he's found his room yet, after all that time I spent with you in the TARDIS, what was left to be scared of?"" Rory answers in the past tense, which the Doctor picks up on, but Rory denies it. I think that in reflecting on the danger which the Doctor has now put the three of them in, Rory believes that they will probably die in this hotel. I find this more believable, considering that this episode makes the point that in traveling with the Doctor, if he was telling the Doctor the truth about not finding his room, and I believe that this is exactly what Rory has been doing, or choosing the Doctor over him.

Okay so I know that the question of the Doctor's age is kind of a gray area

So

Just before Ten regenerated, this past week he has said he was 1200. Rather big jump, right? If we use the above stated numbers, we can see that the Doctor has spent over 30% of his TARDIS days as Eleven. Why that much time? It is not common for the Doctor to spend this much time as a particular regeneration or without gaining any new companions. 

I feel like this could be connected with the Ponds' leaving and the Doctor's growing darkness. I saw a very good theory on here that whatever happens to the Ponds has already happened for the Doctor and we're seeing the episodes out of order. Just something I noticed/bugged me.

On the other hand...

The Silence tried to kill the Doctor to prevent the fruition of a specific prophecy, **when no living creature can speak falsely or fail to answer**, a Question will be asked, a question that must never, ever be answered.""

+ But the Doctor fails to answer when G.I. asks him the question!

+ EVERY living creature failed to answer. With Clara's memory back there were 2 people who knew the Doctor's name. Yet it was River who answered

+ It was ""a fall"". not ""THE fall"". The Doctor fell a million times before!

What I am getting at is that the prophecy is not yet fulfilled, it refers to a completely different event. The Silence ARE trying to stop the Doctor, but not this event. It'll be something in the future.

Other proofs:

~17mins: the Doctor says the graves in Trenzalore are from his final battle.

~22mins: Doctor lives in darker and darker hues day upon day. And he will have other names before the end. The Storm

**EDIT 1/Further Proof:**

http://i.imgur.com/YwThqu2.jpg

I am betting there will be a war

+ Silence will fall when the question is asked... Silence MUST fall

Was there any Silence or even ""silence""? You could argue that the stars were going out would qualify, by the Silence.

Of course that could have easily been explained by a single line ""G.I. was behind it"", they created River Song to fight on their side in an ""endless, bitter war"" (according to Madam Korvian)

It's still a theory though. But it will be very Moffat-y for two similar events both of which coincide with a single prophecy.

**EDIT 2/Further Speculation:**

Now that we know the nature of The Name of The Doctor

The answer to Doctor Who? is a choice between the nature/Name of The Doctor

Perhaps by choosing the wrong nature of The Doctor... he had caused the horrors that Madam Korvian is afraid off. The endless war she referred to

Proof:

Wedding of River Song, but your future is infinitely more terrifying. The Silence believe it must be averted.""

&gt; **DOCTOR:** It's an unreasoning dread of robots. You see, facial expression, that sort of thing. 

&gt; **LEELA:** Body language. 

&gt; **DOCTOR:** Exactly. While these robots are humanoid, talking, dead men. 

&gt; **LEELA:** That's what Poul said. 

&gt; **DOCTOR:** Yes. It undermines a certain type of personality, sometimes even personality disintegration. 

This conversation comes from *The Robots of Death*. It speaks of [**Grimwade's Syndrome**](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Grimwade's_Syndrome) or robophobia

Now compare that to this exchange from *The Waters of Mars*:

&gt; **DOCTOR:**
I hate robots. Did I say?

&gt; **ROMAN:**
Yeah

&gt; **DOCTOR:**
It's not the robots

&gt; **ROMAN:**
Yeah. Friend of mine

&gt; **DOCTOR:**
Ah, that's different.

Here the Doctor says that he hates robots and attributes this hate to how humans will give them more amiable features. Even though he rationalizes this with claiming that these superficiality are ""reducing them"" he makes an irrational exception for when the robot looks like a dog (almost certainly due to his companionship to K-9).

The Doctor has plenty of cause to hate androids. He's grappled with some artificial human countless times

Interestingly enough the Tenth Doctor was called on to check his prejudices not too earlier in his tenure by Jack Harkness in the episode *Utopia* and there's a decent amount of parallel to be drawn here:

&gt; **DOCTOR:** You are. I can't help it. I'm a Time Lord. It's instinct. It's in my guts. You're a fixed point in time and space. You're a fact. That's never meant to happen. Even the Tardis reacted against you

&gt; **JACK:** So what you're saying is that you're prejudiced? 

&gt; **DOCTOR:** I never thought of it like that.

1356545111.0,15h5sd,My thoughts/speculation on Clara and her role as companion.,oag721,62,5,11,"This isn't so much theories as to Clara's time-scattered existence (though a bit of that)

First off, but the twist was great. Credit to another redditor for pointing this out: this is very similar to how Scaroth was misplaced in time in *City of Death*. There was Future Clara in ""Asylum"", Past Clara in ""The Snowmen"", and it looks like he's going to find Present Clara. Sure, there could be other stuff tying into the 50th anniversary with the Time Lords or the Great Intelligence, but I wouldn't mind if it was as simple as finding out what caused her to split. Also, since they seem to have a few things in common (though not completely shared memories)...what if Present Clara is a baker

So yes, after all, supposed to be an audience identification figure. A companion from the present could make connections to today's world, and would me much more competent with computers and such. Also, stories set in events from the 1900s would properly be historicals. (For example, see *The War Games*: Jamie doesn't know about the Civil War--which is comical--but Zoe, who is from the future, the companion could be more competent and equal if she was from the modern day

Another note: watching the trailer

Okay, I do happen to be one of those people who doesn't like to categorize relationships, because in reality they're much deeper.) Throughout the first half or so of ""The Snowmen"", she's drawn to him through curiosity, as she says herself. She meets this mysterious man the minute she meets a mysterious snowman, and he seems to know about it. And she's not going to let him get away with brushing her away, because then he would have had the upper hand (I get a sense of competitiveness in Clara). So she's determined to find out, hides around the TARDIS

Brief note about the ""pond"": I don't think it was meant to do with her seeping memories from ""Asylum"". I think it was just the most practical word. If he refused to help

The relationship takes a turn in the house, which is really him just trying to fit in to the time period and underestimating things. Next is the kiss, which she initiates, and then calls him out for blushing. To me, it's almost as if she is just reciprocating because she's getting to know him and he seems interested in her. I didn't see her at all seem to be going after him, but rather they were having some Victorian Christmas fun--and Smith and Coleman have *great* back-and-forth rapport. Overall, I think her main drive is that she doesn't want him to have the upper hand or withhold information from her (see the scene where she climbs up the ladder and follows him in the TARDIS). She wanted to be treated equally--which is not something that happened to women every day in Victorian London. In addition, and she also seems to sense that something was troubling him.

So now, it looks like we'll be spending time with next year. First of all, I think will be the first time we'll have the Doctor show interest in a someone coming with him *first*, again showing the flip. Right now, the Doctor is heading to find the next version of Clara. This is part out of curiosity, but I think he has a competitiveness to him as well. He's a little frustrated that she has alluded him twice now, and he also has taken a liking to her like any companion and wants her safe--especially since she seems destined for death. This part ties into the theme that has been running since the second half of series 6, Nicholas Courtney--whose character was mentioned dying on-screen--Caroline John

At the same time, like Teagan. Much of her introduction can be skipped because the Doctor (and us as the audience) has just seen it. In fact, I imagine her slightly confused and demanding of information when he drags her in the TARDIS. But above all, I think she will be a challenging partner-in-crime sort of character. Moffat has said that the Doctor has to work to impress her, so I imagine that they continue to one-up each other playfully while still remaining buddies. It's not too different from Romana in *The Ribos Operation*. These actions could be interpreted as flirty, and they might be, but that doesn't mean there will be a full-blown relationship. Meanwhile, because with Amy the Doctor was also the father figure. Now

What do you guys think of my interpretation? I tend to get fed up when things are narrowed down to ""romance"" or ""no romance"" because overall I think it does not matter in defining the character or the relationship, fun monsters, more of the new TARDIS, and the Doctor attempting to fly a plane (as seen in trailer).",,False,,False,t3_15h5sd

I liked it, so that's good. Though when they started riding the triceratops I couldn't help feeling it went a little too far on the silly. I'm a fan who prefers their episodes of the more serious persuasion. Nevertheless, it was entertaining.

A couple things that came to mind:

* I'm shocked the TARDIS wasn't the most valuable thing.

* Nefertiti's outfit. I didn't notice it until that above-shot by the camera of her boobs when Filch has his crutch against her neck but now that I notice it

* It's very clever how the Doctor resolves the situation. The bait and switch with the ships and the Rory/Brian gene chain.

* The opening with the Doctor running around and doing various things seemed a bit...thrown together. I mean

* I laugh at the prop Matt Smith put on Filch's ship. The green ball thing. Lol. That guy really deserved to die. I have no qualms about the Doctor murdering bad people. He does it alll the time.

* I grinned and facepalmed at the two very obvious innuendos.

* I can't believe none of them noticed that they were standing right over a t-rex. Or at least that none of them said ""Wow how did we miss that.""

* Biggest thing that gets my goat: I can't believe they used David Tennant's TARDIS in that photoshop job! How sloppy of them.

* I really liked that camera shot from the pterodactyls POV.

Then next week we have the upcoming ghost episode, Hide, which I anticipate having several parallels with ""The Unquiet Dead"".

She had one adventure with 10 and then everything else is with 11? I assumed she would be a major player for a few regenerations, at least. 

This is my ideal River: she never gave away her regenerations to him; he was saved another way. River becomes the Doctor's on again off again companion/wife for a *while*. Years, but I'm thinking a good version of the Master, or the Rani (I believe? Really sorry if I get this character incorrect). New interpretations of both of them having adventures throughout the series. 11 and River 1. 12 and River 1. 12 and River 2. 13 and River 2. It'd be *interesting*.

Edit: See, that can't happen.

What if the reason Clara is appearing throughout time isn't because the Great Intelligence has put her there (a common theory)

What if there is something the Doctor needs to remember? Clara is his companion, appearing throughout time. A warning for the Doctor, either created by the Doctor, or Clara herself.

I'm picturing that there will be some huge battle between the Great Intelligence and the Daleks. If Clara is somehow involved with the GI, the one he cared about most. Perhaps the Daleks will be after who soon. If the GI is also after her, which seems like an obvious next move after the last episode, there could be a huge conflict between the GI and the Daleks to obtain her. Both would like to use her as a weapon.

I think the Doctor forgets something. Perhaps, to everywhere he would need to be, with hints throughout. It's definitely a Sparrow-type deal, she sends herself throughout time so all the events occur that lead to him searching for her and her becoming a companion. It's all done so that he remembers. He need to remember to remember not just Clara, but whatever happened that she's trying to warn him about.

In the past, I feel like the show is going a little downhill. I'm sure this is not entirely Moffat's fault, as he has to cater to the needs and wants of all the viewers, but it's making me dislike him as a writer more and more. I feel that he has some brilliant ideas, such as the ark, and a dalek asylum, but in the delivery of those ideas, I really couldn't get into the episode since it was so fast paced, you never knew what was going to happen next, but I grew up watching old Classic Who episodes since I was born in

On to Matt Smith.
I honestly don't believe he is a bad actor, but when you take out all the wit and dark humour of him, you're stuck with a random, whimsical guy who sometimes kills people. It just doesn't fit in the Doctor's body(s). He also seems to make shallower connections to people he meets.

Most of it focuses around him being a *past* incarnation. The reason I've usually seen cited for this is because if Eleven knows who he is

If Ten is in the 50th anniversary then Eleven will remember experiencing the events of that episode as Ten. If Ten meets the John Hurt Doctor then Eleven will remember meeting the John Hurt Doctor when he was Ten. Just like in [Time Crash:](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szuP0oBZX4g)

TEN: Don't worry

FIVE: You remembered being me watching you doing that. You only knew what to do because I saw you do it.

It's been around 300 years since the Doctor was Ten. That's around the same amount of time that passed between Five and Ten.

1) Kind of a given, its super massive, and there's bound to be at least hundreds of people looking at it at any given moment, ever (most of them would be at a far distance, considering it's located on an island off the coast, but still, that counts as looking). Even if there were, a moment where absolutely nobody was looking at the statue, to be specific, in fact

This isn't even what bothers me the most; what really gets to me, like River and the Doctor all of a sudden concluding that a paradox would *spoil the well*. But the statue of liberty was just there, and it did nothing. I would have been much more content with the episode had it just not been there at all.


2) I recall the season 5 episode with the Angels (I forget the episode number or what it's called.. sorry) saying *the image of an angel then becomes an angel.* Then Amy started believing she was becoming stone, because she had looked at the image of an angel, and it came out towards her. Why, then, in TATM, were that first dude and rory not attacked by the image of the statue of liberty that was on the back wall of the elevator they both went up on?

1349040029.0,10q79n,[Love Week] Part One - The Works of Murray Gold,jimmysilverrims,62,9,23,"Due to popular demand for ""more love"" here at /r/gallifrey I propose starting a ""love week"" where the point of interest is discussing and examining those little things in Doctor Who that you love. 

**EDIT**: This is just a suggestion for an overall ""theme"". Others are warmly welcomed to join in if they'd like.

To start the ball rolling I'm going to discuss one of my favorite things in New Who: the works of Murray Gold.

I've always been one to say that score is 50% of any movie or show. Whether a scene is touching or suspenseful or triumphant is deeply determined by what message the score is conveying. The flavor and feel of a show isn't just in performances and cinematography. A great deal of it is formed by the almost subconscious presence of music to set the mood.

And when Doctor  Who rebooted itself it hit the *jackpot* when it came to score

I could sing his praises all day but for the sake of brevity I'd like to crystallize his tenure into three separate parts: his work during the Ninth Doctor

**Ninth Doctor**

The first thing we experience in all of New Who is [**the new opening title sequence.**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRE1aOogdPI) We're leapt straight into it and it is a *massive success* with an opening ""Wawawaawaaaaaaaaa"" that creates the ""leaping in"" excitement of the [**1980's lead in**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4On0uLqH_I) while feeling very modern. The addition of accompanying strings is *magnificent* and the piano at the finish was *brilliant!* Seriously

The next thing we experience is *also* shaped by Murray Gold and it's really these first few minutes that the scale of RTD's Doctor Who is shown. [**Westminister Bridge**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_rkVcat-WA), grand, and maybe a bit sad. Then we launch into this very quick and moving pop-synthy beat. It not only shows off the diversity of Gold as a composer, but it really sets the fantastic/mundane contrast that this season of Doctor Who would play so much off of.

I would be remiss if I didn't mention [**The Doctor's Theme**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrOI7By5fc). It's so... beautiful. It's wholly original and so different from everything Doctor Who has ever done before but it so perfectly embodied what the post-Time War Doctor was. This theme pretty much defined RTD's Doctors

**Tenth Doctor**

During the Tenth Doctor Murray Gold was given the entire BBC Orchestra and a lot of freedom. He managed to create two great action themes for the Doctor: [**All the Strange

He manages to explore a great range from the very tribal [**Tooth and Claw**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB2FCUnJPwI) to the Elfman-ish [**Donna's Theme**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OyVsrVGm_c) to the bizarre and spacey [**Cassandra's Waltz**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXyiVpnd6Po) to the old-school throwback meets dubstep of [**The Master's Theme**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcagHjJRl4I) (which worked in the four beat wonderfully and felt madly unhinged

At the same time he creates *another* brilliant title sequence [**for Torchwood**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eqnml1VO7s) and creates some of the most moving work in Doctor Who's history which is

**Eleventh Doctor**

Doctor Who changes hands and Gold has to set a wholly new feel for the show

But his greatest triumph is no doubt [**I Am the Doctor**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5D-QPDGhCtM) and the many variations therein. An amazingly versatile theme that embodies the Eleventh Doctor just as well as The Doctor's Theme embodied Nine and Ten. It's fun and bouncy and whimsical and just perfectly *Eleven*.

I cannot recommend listening to Murray Gold's OST works enough. His work is just *fantastic*.",,t5_2tf29,1349056060.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/10q79n/love_week_part_one_the_works_of_murray_gold/
1348692975.0,10iytd,The Moffat Paradox - Are the Companions the True Protagonists of Doctor Who?,jimmysilverrims,64,11,31,"Not long ago Moffat made the (fairly bold) [statement](http://www.metro.co.uk/tv/896754-steven-moffat-the-doctor-who-companion-is-the-main-character) that the protagonist of Doctor Who were not the Doctor but were

Now while in many of his interviews he'll cite standard formula and there being ""good, and romantic interest](http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/steven-moffat-would-a-middleaged-person-abscond-in-a-magic-caravan-8096356.html) along with [having to be attractive](http://www.geekosystem.com/steve-moffat-doctor-who-companions-attractive-girls/) this time he seems to be less following the established order out of necessity but honestly believing that Doctor Who is [""their story"".](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lC5O68JLPg)

But by the same hand Moffat's a *huge* fan at heart. He adores the Doctor and says himself that *Blink* can't possibly be the best episode of Doctor Who because [""It's hardly got the Doctor in it!"" [@ 1:52]](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bWyzeTFGPI&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=112s)

This leads us to a difficult paradox. If the story's protagonist is the companions than the Doctor would naturally become a mentor or partner to compliment or in other ways catalyze their story but being the *enormous* fan that he is Moffat wants the Doctor to be the hero that he knows and loves.

But having both is a precarious edge to tread. Having the Doctor be the ""hero"" but not be the protagonist causes a plethora of storytelling troubles. 

An excellent example of this causing issues is in Series Six where the show tries (and in many ways fails) to juggle the weight of a Doctor-centric death

Some of Moffat's most successful stories have the Doctor either edge aside and act as a catalyst for the events of a character (A Christmas Carol

After getting into the rhythm of things with series 5, the whole shebang. And I loved it.  Then, with the first half series seven, it seems like he's setting the show up for something even bigger.

If this trend continues, and bigger. More action, more mystery, more everything. Which will be great. For a while. Then, after a few series of one-upping the series before, it'll eventually become just a caricature of the show that we all love. It'll be a procedural action show, about a crime fighting alien. Entertaining

The fear of this potential fate of my favorite television series is also tied to my biggest hope for the anniversary special.  Throughout the remaining episodes of the seventh series, as it's doing. Then it pops. Everything explodes.

Forget the multi-Doctor hopes (though I am happy about Tennant's return), but more importantly, I hope it serves as the catalyst for a big change.

I, but set it on a path that breaths another fifty years into it.  If Moffat stays, I want to see a change.  If Smith stays, I want to see a change. If the show stays, I *need* to see a change.

I for one fell in love with this series from the off - I loved the characters, hunting down and stopping aliens with her sonic lipstick and her giant alien computer. I found the second series to be the show's weakest output, with Anjli Mohindra still getting to grips with her acting and some of the poorest episodes of the series' run. But one thing I found with all the other series is that they perfectly maintained one thing - consistency. Bar the second series, I didn't think there was a single episode I would have called bad. Infact, I'd go as far to say that it often put out episodes that were as good as the best of *Doctor Who* - examples being [*Whatever Happened to Sarah Jane?*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c9kVV9xOKg) and [*Death of the Doctor*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbXAq-Fi8JI) - one of my favourite stories which featured the Eleventh Doctor and classic companion Jo Grant.

Can you imagine? I had one idea! An idea that has never stopped. Rolling out across the centuries. I have slept, and every time I open my eyes, there they are. My Daleks. Outlasting eternity. And all from one man!

THE DOCTOR

Oh

First I'll start off (as usual) with a thanks to those that have been writing about what they love in Doctor Who. It's been really awesome for these often-underappreciated facets get their ten minutes in the limelight. Goodness knows they deserve it. Right

And while the Doctor may not have the wear-the-exact-same-thing-all-the-time wardrobe that many Doctors during JNT's era had

Seeing as there's *so much* to tell from that infamous scarf to umbrellas with punctuation for handles I can't imagine that I'll be able to cover the Doctor's *vast* array of styles. For now I'll focus on the wardrobes of New Who (and hopefully elaborating on the others in the comments).

**Ninth Doctor**

A really bold departure from Doctor's past. Not formal

Designed by then-costume coordinator [**Lucinda Wright**](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Lucinda_Wright) the Ninth Doctor's style includes (as Jack so flippantly put it) a U-Boat captain's jacket

I really can't say enough how bold it was to make a suit so incredibly different from everything else the Doctor's ever worn. It really sets Nine (and New Who as a whole) apart from the rest of the show.

**Tenth Doctor**

Doctor Who Confidential did [**a marvelous piece**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z32s1tO23SI) on the Tenth Doctor's wardrobe. How Tennant felt getting in it

Created by [**Louise Page**](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Louise_Page), Martha, Donna, the Master, Rassilon and virtually every single character in between. She does a *marvelous* [**series of interviews**](http://www.youtube.com/user/stevenricks?feature=watch) where she answers everything from why they chose Converse for Ten to how they picked his glasses.

Ten's look was described by many as ""geek chic"" and it's no secret that he's considered by many Who fans as ""the dreamy one"". His look right down to [**his stance**](http://i2.listal.com/image/1703166/500full.jpg) is incredibly iconic.

**Eleventh Doctor**

What can I say? Whether it meant to or not this thing brought back the bow tie. This Doctor's one of the few Doctor's to actually have remarks made and remark himself on his clothes.

In fact the clothing is so intertwined with the character they actually have a run-down of the Doctor's clothes in a a bit of a [**special for Children in Need**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaKPJpSMMjA). 

The style was created by the costume designer for season three of Torchwood (and the current costume designer for both Doctor Who and Sherlock) [**Ray Holman**](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Ray_Holman). Here's [**a sketch he made that eventually became the Eleventh Doctor**](http://clothesonfilm.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Doctor-Who_Matt-Smith_Ray-Holman-sketch.jpg). He describes [**his thoughts on the Eleventh Doctor**](http://clothesonfilm.com/doctor-who-interview-with-costume-designer-ray-holman/9611/) as ""[...] a mixture of professor and student; he is still learning yet is an authority on many

I'll do a suitable TL;DR soon.**

I've been mulling this around and don't have time to get it all out right now

I think Moffat is going to wrap up the entirety of the show (as it stands so far) as a story about love, memories, and loved ones in the last few years, it would bring a lot of things full-circle. Doctor Who had always been a family show...now it's a show about family.  Sounds like fluff, but there are some interesting ""hard"" details that could back this up - just a bit for now since there's a LOT of evidence.

1. **The Doctor's Love:** Progression of the Doctor from non-romantic character who loves in a familial/friendship sense (Susan through all other companions) to one who loves passionately.  The passion love begins with slight interest (Grace) then moves to passion (Rose, bliss, heartbreak, depression, etc.)  Now we have Clara...

2. **Remember Me:** It goes without saying there's been a memory/remembrance theme overload the last couple years.  Note the people who want to be remembered or who are looked back on/discussed at length: Rose, Clara, the Doctor.  Now the Doctor's previous adventures are being called in here and there...including Susan in the latest episode!  There is keen attention paid to the importance of remembering - particularly remembering those you love.  That's a pretty big theme in life.  Nobody wants to be forgotten and alone. Considering that the Doctor is the loneliest being in the universe and the show title explicitly ""forgets"" him or doesn't know him...having family/loved ones to surround you and remember you is especially poignant for him.

3. **A Rose by Any Other Name:** I think Rose/Clara/River are tied together somehow given the recent episodes and the fan theories around them.  Between the Bad Wolf time/space manipulation, there are interesting bits of evidence on this subreddit that suggest they are the same entity.  Also interesting is the wiki note that Susan's name supposedly means ""Rose"" in High Gallifreyan. (Though ""Susan"" itself means lotus and it's not directly in the show, so it's not necessarily evidence.)

4. **Grandfather Time:** I also think that Susan is involved here. The last episode's reference to his granddaughter firmed up any question of Susan's relationship to the Doctor in preparation for the 50th.  I think she is River/the Doctor's granddaughter.  How is this possible?  If in fact the 50th is a ""fan-service"" multi-Doctor story and has something to do with the Time War (stretching, this can give a fun explanation to why the 1st Doctor speaks like a sooth-sayer and a stereotypical wise old guy - he's seen how far he will go, he's seen his own future, and he knows via story what he will go through.  But he's never actually FELT it.  Paraphrasing the Doctor, he ""acted older and smarter than everyone else like you do when you're young.""  If he has an idea of the fate/family to come, he'll be even more sure of himself. 

4. **What's in a Name?** We have an interesting duality with the importance of naming starting to appear.  Your name is your identity, it is worth dying to save.  When asked why he is opting to hang versus admit a crime he did not commit, John Proctor from Arthur Milller's *The Crucible* says, ""Because it is my name! Because I cannot have another in my life! Because I lie and sign myself to lies! Because I am not worth the dust on the feet of them that hang! How may I live without my name? I have given you my soul; leave me my name!"" When your name is heard, how does the hearer feel?  What do they remember?  What does it inspire them to do?  Long after we are dead, our name tells many stories.  For the Doctor, it's even more important - he's a time traveler.  He sees his impact on history and feels it first-hand. But then,"" a preposterous-yet-unstoppable hero (or villain) tied to trillions of stories throughout time.  In the span of space and time, which might be very important to this theory.  Given names are

5. **Can't Stay in Neverland Forever**  Ever since Matt Smith' head poked out of the TARDIS to find his 7-year-old mother-in-law living alone, 6, and 7a have plenty of examples with the three Ponds (don't forget the Doctor's cradle!)  Season 7 brings us Clara, and she's a crescendo.  In all three incarnations, she's lost her mother and she loved her very much.  In TRoA, Clara's mother's death is critical to resolving the conflict.  Also in all three cases, her life doesn't allow ""childish"" wiggle room.  First she's in a survival situation against killer robots.  Then she lives two Victorian lives, we see her with her dreams on hold, willing to die so that others may live.  She is loyal through death and beyond resentment.  She has big dreams and wakes to follow them.  Despite her past tragedies and her current burdens,) but she's certainly maternal.  I think these themes and characters lend credence to a 50th that deals mainly with the Doctor's family.

The last episode I can pin down that makes truly solid social critique was *The Beast Below* and it's skewering of the follies of a democracy that would rather benefit from cruelty unaware than seek the truth. Since then episodes haven't really focused on making a social statement so much as telling a character-focused story or mythos-heavy episodes that push plot along.

Robert Holmes (1926-1986), and wrote stories for the series from 1969 (first story being *The Krotons*) to his tragic death in 1986 (his last story being *The Mysterious Planet*, although he contributed to *The Ultimate Foe* before he died). He is considered by most to be the best script editor for the series, as well as the best writer, penning stories that were commonly believed to be the best among Doctor Who's 50 year run. 

Since I have been on a huge Robert Holmes binge lately (Netflix hasn't been helping...with classics like *Spearhead From Space*, a few questions have popped up into my mind concerning the writer's work:

*The first (and obvious one): What is his best story?

*What is his weakest story?

*Do you think there's a noticeable evolution in his writing style in his nearly 20 years on the program?

*What aspects of Holmes' scripts made them work so well? (Provided you agree that they work)

*Robert Holmes didn't write a story between 1978's *The Power of Kroll* and 1984's *Caves of Androzani*. Do you think this affected his story telling style at all?

In fact, even the Cybermen in that one second seemed to move in a very creepy fashion.

There is so much I want to talk about in this scene between Amy and the Doctor, I hope to be pardoned for opening up an independent channel for discussion.

So basically, in *The Wedding of River Song*, and it's what Oswin tells the Doctor to do. But here we very definitely hear Eleven talking about *why* he runs. So like I said, it's a very definite and conscious movement in the opposite direction from Nine and Ten running from himself, from the Time War, from responsibility. And it's also been a minor theme of Eleven's recent relationship with the Ponds, that real life is what goes on when he's not there - again

So like I said earlier, do we believe it? The idea of running to something is very much in the character of the Eleventh Doctor's constant wonderment at the universe, I feel, but his delivery of the line - utterly excellent, I shouldn't have to add - is so uncharacteristic. He's so serious-earnest when he says it, rather than bubbly-earnest; the first time I heard the line, it almost sounded as though he's trying to convince himself that he's not running away.

Thank you

Let me explain. Home on a Saturday afternoon with nothing to do, fully expecting to be a simple affair where the Doctor and Companion X get into some trouble and make their way out at the last second. I have never been happier to be wrong in my life.

For those who have not seen the episodes, who develops a distinct personality, morality, and consciousness from that of the Doctor. The program then goes on to explore the nature of existence and sacrifice, and in doing so instills a sense of profound existentialism in the audience.

I've never felt more during a television show before in my life. I saw the life that John Smith had and realized that he was *a real person*, a lonely man? Why not stay John Smith, the man with a love? Why should his consciousness be replaced by the doctor, who could never feel what John Smith feels? His feelings, his hopes, his dreams, and his weaknesses are all real

I thought about the nature of being, about the future, and as cliche as it sounds, about the meaning of life. Now I have never been religious and have always held onto the idea that in the world in which we exist, each destiny is self-determined and that therefore we must strive to *achieve* the most that we can. After watching John Smith live out his life from a young man till old age, seeing his wedding and his children, his joys and his triumphs, after all that

Live John Smith, and John Smith for merely hours. The doctor saw vast stars and experiences many things, and Smith spent his life as a simple schoolteacher in England. But, John Smith knew what it was to live, while the doctor continues to travel through time. At the end of the day, whose life was better spent?",,,,

In my opinion it's the most plausible Clara theory yet. The gist of it is:

- The Doctor takes off the nanogene protective wristband and thus becomes infected with the nanogenes
- Oswin saying ""remember me"" at the end of Asylum of the Daleks was her inserting herself into the nanogenes
- If the Doctor stays still for long enough (like he did in Victorian London) the nanogenes will create a new Clara.

1357998800.0,16fpsi,Who considers Susan to be The Doctor's biological grand daughter?,Shackled_Form,73,21,44,"I have read a few articles in the past stating that people believe Susan isn't the Doctor's grand daughter for whatever reasons.

Since I consider the TV show as the only true source of canon (if you want to debate that point there's another thread you can visit) and I don't recall an episode stating that she isn't his biological descendant then I think she definitely must be and I'm curious to know why people don't think she is

As far as I'm concerned the Doctors early years consisted of him going to school, popping out a couple of children with a wife (or Gallifreyan equivalent) and then becoming a grandparent before stealing the TARDIS and stepping onto our TV screens for the first time. I have no concerns with that process. I know in the early days the producers didn't want the Doctor to be considered 'sexually active' which is where I think the Susan theories started.

But for me it makes me respect the Doctor more to think he had that life before some mysterious fate befell his child/children and he left everything behind to travel. I actually think it would make a good 50th anniversary story.

You can reply if you want


**Starting the Show and its Strengths**

Nobody told me anything about this show, and they were difficult to get into without any prior knowledge of anything. (I bet I'd enjoy them now that I know the characters and what the show is all about) The show starts out really cheesy (which is fine) and doesn't have the best flow... But you start to get to know the characters through relationships that start to form. This is, in my opinion, Doctor Who's strong point. Relationships. The Doctor, the companions, their families and friends... It's all good. 

**Musing on the Episodic Nature of the Show**

So after finally getting into the show a little bit more I had a couple problems. It bothered me that individual episodes didn't seem to necessarily... matter? There are a few blips here and there that carry over

**Finishing Series One**

It wasn't until we started reaching the end of season one that I really was in love with the characters. Rose was EXCELLENT. The Doctor was great

The whole ""bad wolf"" thing gave the series some much needed continuity as well. The way it ended was... well... excellent. It was emotional, Rose was AWESOME. Given all of the power she had, she showed her true self. She was truly good. BUT we were losing the 9th Doctor and he was being replaced with somebody new. Somebody I had doubts about because I liked number 9. Doubts that REALLY didn't last very long AT ALL.

**Series Two**

Season 2 was more of the same hit or miss for me... But again, as the show went on and we approached the end of the season... it just got better and better.

**Losing a Companion**

As I said before, and this wasn't an exception... But it made me.. grumpy. I was grumpy and a bit emotional. Rose was gone, but Rose in my mind COULDN'T be gone and have the show continue. When they said their goodbyes I was even more grumpy and emotional. The Doctor didn't get to tell Rose that he loved her. Upsetting. 

**Series Three**

Season 3... Season 3, he just sort of immediately got a new companion (a Rose replacement?!) and that seemed to be that. I appreciated the fact that he seemed to be hurting at least, although he was kind of unintentionally a jerk to Martha… I spent the first 6 episodes grumpy that Rose ""wasn't back yet"" and that the Doctor didn't even seem to be trying. 

**More on Losing a Companion**

Then I realized... She's not coming back. This show isn't about Rose and the Doctor. It's about the Doctor. It took me that realization to even give our new companion a chance. Martha Jones was fine. She was strong in a different way. Helpful

This is where things got tougher to keep watching for me. Don't get me wrong, and things REALLY escalated in a good way. Still no Rose. Hmm… But a great finale. 

**More Frustration With the Episodic Nature of the Show**

At this point, and most episodes STILL don't matter. When I say that what I mean is that there is no cohesive PLOT to go through from episode to episode. 

This bothers me. It's like watching a kids cartoon where you could simply pop in and out of watching without missing much. Not only that

**Donna as Companion**

Season 4 gets us a new companion yet again. Here we have Donna Donna is NOTHING like the previous companions. That is not a bad thing. Their relationship is unique. They don't obviously love each other like Rose and the Doctor did

**Series Four Plot**

This season we get hints sort of like the whole ""bad wolf"" thing that something special is going on. It's minor, so leave me alone. haha. 

**Thoughts on the Finale**

Moving forward a bit we get into the AMAZING season finale again. FANTASTIC. Not only does EVERYTHING finally come together, and it was good. The series could have easily ended right here and now, and it would have been a great ending. 

**Looking back at Series 1-4**

This show just got better and better and better during seasons 1-4. For me, to actually being pretty good. I still wished that the episodes had more continuity and meaning, but the finales were so good and the relationships were done so well that things were just dandy. The emotional range of the Doctor himself was REALLY impressive. Things were good. 

Here is where I start to have some serious problems. 

**Enter Moffat**

I didn't even like in Season 3 (or 4) when we had to just move on with the new companions

It is as if they stealth re-booted the series. NOTHING that happened previously has any significance at all. None of the previous companions. None of the lessons learned as the previous Doctor… Nothing. I've never seen anything quite like it. 

How frustrating is this? I can't possibly be the only one who thought this. It's not the new Doctor's fault either, it's always fun when he says something is ""cool"" like bow-ties and what not. 

**Moffat's Companions**

So the problem isn't the Doctor. So is it the new companions? Amy Pond is unique, the lone centurion for example was really great. He really, REALLY loves Amy Pond. 

And that's great… But wait. I find myself just not caring at all. I just do not care about these characters, that one might not be true. But I'm just so frustrated. So many things are done wrong in the midst of so many things being done right. 

**Overarching Plots in Moffat's Era**

My previous complaints about episodes not mattering is completely gone in seasons 5 and 6

The quality of the show had risen

**River's Tale and Connecting the Doctors**

River's storyline was REALLY cool. HOWEVER, the story lines of the previous companions and characters were pretty well completed. It makes sense to not just thrust them into new seasons where that isn't necessary… HOWEVER, the DOCTOR is still here, and because the Doctor is still here, there should be memories… Reflections… SOMETHING that pulls the series together.  

I'm sure that in between this new Doctor Who and the series that existed long long long ago the same thing occurs

Am I the only one who feels this way? Is the ""fandom"" split? I just can't stand it

I don't know why I've typed all this up


**TL;DR**:

The series grew a lot on me all the way from season 1-4 in a very good way. I love the relationships that develop between characters

Season 5 feels like a stealthy reboot where nothing that happened before matters. It fixes a lot of the problems that I had with no overarching story

1. Every teenage boy got to live vicariously through him.

How many teenage boys dreamed of the day they'd get to travel with the Doctor? Most of the male companions are too old for the 10-14 year old crowd to identify with, but still acted like a child, leading him to be rebellious. However, he struggled to impress the ""cool"" older kids, so he ended up feeling like a bit of a social outcast. These are all things boys go through at his age, and while we can hate him from the outside, you know you probably acted a bit like him when you were young (and undoubtedly cringe at the thought).

2. The Doctor got to play the father figure

Adric is struggling for attention, to strive to be like. Many of the previous companions treated the Doctor as a father figure, but Adric and the Doctor shared a more natural bond - Adric wanted to be the Doctor, and the Doctor saw himself in Adric. The Doctor even bragged about him like a son, always mentioning how great he was at mathematics. While I love the Jamie/Two combo, I think Adric and Four/Five shared a more interesting father/son relationship. The relationship was often tried when Adric met other potential father figures like the Doctor, but we see that in the end, and the Doctor to him. 

3. The Doctor needed to lose a companion.

The death of Adric is definitely a traumatizing moment in the life of the Doctor. The Doctor, companions always left in one piece. Adric's death in important because it made the Doctor realize that while he is essentially immortal, his friends aren't. This experience plays a role in his relationship with Amy/Rory/Clara for sure.

4. He could do Block Transfer Computation

That was bad-ass.

To a human, this seems like a reasonable thing to say--something lesser species shouldn't even mess around with to test.

That Mels ought to take him at his word in any temporal matter (which is further interesting, because River never does).

I think that it's been pretty clear that New Who has made many leaps and bounds past the confines of Classic Who most notably being it's incredibly progressive handling of different genders, race, and belief. RTD's work in particular managed to push a message of ""universal acceptance"" without bashing you over the head with it.

I think that [**this interview with Christopher Eccleston conducted before the series aired**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgpT0wjC-iY&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=144s) is particularly insightful on the message of New Who saying:

&gt; The Doctor's message seems to be ""you have a short life

That theme really resonates with the second episode of the revitalized show

**Women**

Classic Who had a long battle with the underwritten female role. Female companions who served as eye-candy in tight spandex or bikinis who would get kidnapped almost as much as they'd scream. While some of their companions shined as jewels of complexity and self-reliance (Ace

In New Who we really get a full-bodied character through Rose. She has a job, not clever, not important, not beautiful or buxom. These characters all get rounded, get explored, and most importantly act as independent partners for the Doctor and not just liabilities.

**LGBT**

Probably the most bold step the show took was it's handling of sexual orientation. Having a pansexual main character (in a children's show) is arguably the biggest step forward the show took. Jack's kiss with the Doctor, it was landmark for science fiction as a whole.

Doctor Who is one of the few shows that will frequently include homosexual and bisexual characters and make very little deal of it. The concepts of homosexual marriage is treated as a standard right and their sexual preference doesn't define who they are as a character. The fact that New Who has *consistently* continued this theme is *very* impressive.

**Religion**

Ha! Bet you think I was going to talk about Mickey and the Doctor's Northern accent and all the different cultures that have been steadily better represented throughout the series! But I *didn't!* (Mostly so that someone else can yak about it elsewhere).

Instead I'd like to focus on how Doctor Who has (fairly gradually) gotten more and more talkative on the subject of religion. ""*The Satan Pit*"" actually discusses the Doctor's views on religion (albeit in a rather skittish and indirect way) and ""*The God Complex*"" takes the first major step by showing the clever and independent Rita who is the first Muslim semi-companion.

Overall I'm just bowled over by how casual and effortless Doctor Who is about portraying diversity and I'm glad that it seems this trend will only continue into the show's future.",,t5_2tf29,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/10s8uh/love_week_part_two_lgbt_portrayal_enthnic/
1348806672.0,10lrnv,Want to know the chronological order of Series Seven so far? Here it is.,jimmysilverrims,54,10,44,"The first and most obvious thing we can ascertain is that ***Dinosaurs on a Spaceship*** **must occur before** ***The Power of Three*** as Brian Williams first meets the Doctor in *Dinosaurs on a Spaceship* and recognizes him in *The Power of Three*.

The second most obvious order is that ***Asylum of the Daleks*** **occurs before** ***Dinosaurs on a Spaceship*** (and thus before *The Power of Three*). We know this because when the Doctor talks to Amy about the modeling job she had she responds by telling him that she quit it. Seeing as we see her having this job in *Asylum of the Daleks* (and other things like how Rory and Amy don't seem to be on the verge of divorce in later episodes) we can safely affirm that ***Asylum of the Daleks*** **happens before both** ***Dinosaurs on a Spaceship*** **and** ***The Power of Three***

The third and likely least noticeable clue is the timing of *A Town Called Mercy*. Now some rumor has been going about claiming that Amy and Rory's ""entirely different clothes"" they return to their friend's reception in in *The Power of Three* are the same as worn in *A Town Called Mercy*. However after double-checking for myself it's clear that [**Amy and Rory are not wearing the same clothes as in** ***Mercy***.](http://i.imgur.com/7O35c.png) However *Power of Three* does have a yellowish cowboy hat with a bullethole in it that is, which the Stetson Craig gave him does not possess) meaning that ***A Town Called Mercy*** **happens before the scene where you see the hat in** ***The Power of Three*** (this still includes the possibility that it happened during).

And though we can say for absolutely certain that ***A Town Called Mercy*** **happens before the last half of** ***The Power of Three*** we **cannot say for certain that it happened after** ***Asylum of the Daleks*** **or** ***Dinosaurs on a Spaceship***. Meaning that it is the only really uncertain variable on this list

So our pieced together timeline is as follows:

1. Possibly *A Town Called Mercy*

2. ***Asylum of the Daleks***

2. Possibly *A Town Called Mercy*

2. ***Dinosaurs on a Spaceship***

3. Possibly *A Town Called Mercy* 

4. **The first ~~half~~ few minutes of** ***The Power of Three*** (turns out the hat makes an earlier appearance [about one minute into the episode](http://i.imgur.com/yelyY.png)).

5. Possibly *A Town Called Mercy*

5. **The rest of** ***The Power of Three***

I'd also like to say that other attempts to work around the age issue would result in similar issues.

But what did we have to give up for more Amy thinking she is the only person who has ever been important to the Doctor? A full season about Clara. Instead we get a handful of episodes to explain a relatively complicated companion, not find her, but go on an adventure with whoever happens to be around in the mean time. I still absolutely LOVE The Lodger, why not have another episode or two along that vein? I have always found myself enjoying the infrequent companions a little more than the regulars, not to hate on the regular companions (sorry Rory and Rose!). For example, I enjoy Amelia more than Amy, loved Craig and Stormageddon, why not another Alien for an episode? We also could have had more episodes dedicated to Clara in different time lines as different people

Lastly, is a little more River Song. I mean we have never seen River and the Doctor together just to two of them. Why not an episode or two covering a night out on the town for the two of them, one that ends with him dropping her back off at the prison? I feel that Moffat ended River's time line with Amy and Rory's for no real reason. Nothing says that she had to end right then. I was so happy to see her back during the finale, and that it was post Silence at the Library River was perfect. I just would have loved to see her a few more times, instead of the rather lack luster ending she had in NY with Rory and Amy. 

This is just my dream for a season. I didn't think it was necessary to have a few more average episodes with Amy, was just a waste. I would also hope that Clara ends here and now, or at least after the 50th. I feel like so many of her questions were answered that this would have been the perfect place to end her. She could have had her 1 season like Martha Jones and then we could have had a complete fresh start after the 50th.

Around 21:16, and a very Moffat-esque idea (And yes, I know that he didn't write this one; I can't account for *why* it sounds Moffat-y to me, it just does).

I like the idea, of course (see Ten's view on regeneration being like dying and having a different man get up and walk away; also true, to an extent, but a much more bleak way of looking at it than I like). But I'm interested right now in retrofitting the Doctor's previous post-regeneration moments to see if we see them differently, in light of this new statement.

That might not make sense, Rose was the first face that Ten saw, immediately following regeneration. He'd grown attached to her as Nine, but her's was the first face that face saw - she was the one who got imprinted. One of the reasons I like this theory so much is because it helps explain, to me at least, why Ten was so attached to Rose, and why he loved her so much. He liked her well enough as Nine, but Ten is when their relationship changed definitively in a romantic-attraction direction.

So let's go backwards again, the Tenth Doctor states that Eight died alone. Which is incredibly sad to think about, but that's a different heart(s)-wrenching subject to deal with. But what dose that mean for Nine, then? We don't know enough of what he did prior to meeting Rose (the photos Clive owns aren't necessarily from pre-Rose adventures, because time travel), and looking in the mirror at Rose's flat is apparently the first time Nine has stopped to examine himself. So was Nine able to imprint himself on anyone, and what does that mean?

This is sort of my next point - what *does* imprinting do or mean? My personal theory, a bit like the Tenza, whatever is needed. Amelia needed someone who was brave and approachable to children and just a little bit smoke-and-mirrors distraction-y, Rose needed someone fun and reckless, someone who did exactly what her perception of the Doctor did (Someone who ""doesn't give up, doesn't let things happen,"" someone who makes a stand, and Ten turned out to be a lot of those things. So what does it mean that Nine may not have had anyone to imprint on? That he only had his previous death to go on

Let's complicate things just once more, that the first face that face saw was... his own?

1346973007.0,zh4j8,The Real Reason So Few Listen to Big Finish,jimmysilverrims,52,10,36,"**TL;DR**: It's too bloody expensive. Look at this data.

The Eighth Doctor

But there's an issue with these audio plays

Ever since I caught word of this audio series I was eager to devour them as I had done with New Who via Netflix. But my excitement was quickly dashed once I looked at the going rates.

Here are the figures:

    Eighth Doctor Adventures - Series 1 (Download):  $40.00
    Eighth Doctor Adventures - Series 2 (Download):  $55.00
    Eighth Doctor Adventures - Series 3 (Download):  $55.00
    Eighth Doctor Adventures - Series 4 (Download):  $80.00
                                             Total: $230.00

Now perhaps comparing it to Netflix's comparatively paltry $7.99 a month (which gives you two years and four months before becoming more expensive than Big Finish) as that is *streaming* and not *downloading*. This is a *huge* difference as with a download you can enjoy watching and rewatching the episodes at your leisure as many times as you'd like for as long as you'd like.

For that let's look at the cost of New Who on iTunes...

    New Who - Series 6 (Download):   $37.99
    New Who - Series 5 (Download):   $22.99
    New Who - Specials (Download):   $23.92
    New Who - Series 4 (Download):   $24.99
    New Who - Series 3 (Download):   $24.99
    New Who - Series 2 (Download):   $24.99
    New Who - Series 1 (Download):   $24.99
                            Total:  $184.86

That's the *entirety* of New Who *with* specials, and featurettes. It's also important to note that while New Who has at least thirteen episodes a season **the Eight Doctor's seasons only contain *eight* episodes (save the fourth season, which has ten).**

But let's assume that you want more than a download. You want a nice physical copy of everything. For that let's compare Big Finish's CD's to New Who's DVDs *and* BluRays.

    New Who - Series 1    (DVD):  $57.95
    New Who - Series 2    (DVD):  $51.76
    New Who - Series 3    (DVD):  $51.32
    New Who - Series 4    (DVD):  $53.93
    New Who - Specials (BluRay):  $40.95
    New Who - Series 5 (BluRay):  $59.95
    New Who - ACC      (BluRay):  $14.94 
    New Who - Series 6 (BluRay):  $63.85
    New Who - TDtWatW  (BluRay):  $16.93
                          Total: $411.58

And now Big Finish...

    Eighth Doctor Adventures - Series 1 (CD):   $95.23
    Eighth Doctor Adventures - Series 2 (CD):   $95.23
    Eighth Doctor Adventures - Series 3 (CD):   $95.23
    Eighth Doctor Adventures - Series 4 (CD):  $142.85
                                       Total:  $428.54

Now here I should note that there are cheaper alternatives to purchasing the New Who DVDs and CDs from other readily available outlets. On Amazon alone I found used and bulk outlets selling the same products for cheaper. Let us also note that I included *all* of the BluRay editions when applicable despite the fact that I could just as easily purchase the DVDs and have sound quality equal or slightly greater to that of the Big Finish productions. Let's also note that the DVDs and BluRays include featurettes, bloopers, and all sorts of extras that you would not have with Big Finish. Note once again that I am purchasing these items as cheaply as regularly available from Big Finish through their subscription program.

Now I think that the figures speak for themselves

Than having said I'm sure one could find both New Who *and* the Eighth Doctor Adventures in their entirety available for download from other... less reputable ports of call.",,t5_2tf29,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/zh4j8/the_real_reason_so_few_listen_to_big_finish/

Writing.

Nine and Ten felt like full-bodied people with a sense of humor and a philosophy and their own likes and dislikes. They've seen Ghostbusters and Back to the Future and The Muppet Movie and they're willing to just plain enjoy being in the company of others. They felt like real people.

Eleven is more of a character. Rarely does he make a *joke* that you laugh at. With Eleven you don't laugh with him so much as laugh at him and his bizarre quirks and offhanded odd remarks.

1376445211.0,1kbka6,A few theories on the Orginization of the Dalek Paradigm Empire.,Bridgeru,46,1,11,"So

Naturally a lot of this is conjecture

1. **The Time War structure**

So, etc etc), but we do get two *very* good glimpses at the structures of the Dalek armies in the show, the ""rebuilt"" Dalek Empires in Parting of the Ways and Journey's End. Both were built by beings who had just come out of the Time War (Davros from a year after the start, the Dalek Emperor presumably from the end and the burning of Gallifrey/Dalek Fleet), so I think we can kinda take some assumptions from both fleets. 

First we can see that neither really use a planet as a base (yes, build me a temple and kill some humans while you do it 'kay? Great"" IMO) but rather specially designed mobile spacecraft (the Emperor's Saucer and the Crucible). From that I think we can see a big part of the Dalek's strategy in the Time War: Instead of being based on a planet (which could be intefered with in the past by the Time Lords by crashing a meteor into it or using supernovae) the Daleks seem to have been based from a large, mobile fleet, probably moving in and out of the Time Vortex often enough to be protected from Time-Retcons by the Time Lords. Another aspect of the Time War was the uniformity, nearly all Daleks were alike because nearly all Daleks had to be soldiers, instead of whatever they would have been otherwise (all Daleks kill yes, but what's the point in cloning many builder Daleks when you could clone Trooper Daleks) the only difference being the extreme higher-ranking Daleks (the Emperor and his Guard for example) same with their spacecraft. They built everything to maximize assault capability since war was their main purpose. And, Time War Daleks ran on background Time radiation

2. **Rebuilding an Empire**

So, but we know they use Time Corridor tech to leave, a decidedly low-tech way to Time Travel as the Doctor says in Remembrance). Obviously, they succeed, but we have to admit they'd have a tough job ahead of them. A few points I want to make here: Resources would have been hard to come by for them.

1. The act of physically building an Empire would be shockeningly hard. Without raw resources with which to build casings and saucers and buildings to house Dalek Scientists, I personally believe, the Paradigm Daleks ""set up shop"" on a planet to rebuild, it may have been Skaro (though that would have had to have been later abandoned, and may have been little more than wreckage afer the Time War), it may have been a planet with rich resources, personally I'd give it a name like Edanar but that's my own bad naming scheme, Edanar

2. The Progenitor especially would have had limited uses to create Paradigm Daleks before it's genetic material would have ran out. Even then, such as humans. These Daleks wouldn't have been seen as ""pure"" as the Paradigm Daleks so they were given the old casings (at least physically, I don't think they'd be on the level of Time War Daleks in power personally), with the Paradigm serving as the ""elite"" caste and the RTD casings serving as the lower plebian caste. Not to say they wouldn't be valued, in my mind if a Dalek could prove it's individual worth it would end up higher in the system along with any clones it may produce since it's stock may be taken as more ""worthy"".

3. After using up enough of the Home Planet's resources, at this stage IMO their Empire as a whole would probably be a linear time entity and not a time-travelling empire, though individuals would certainly have had limited travel. Also, I see the Paradigm Daleks being more on par with the TV21 Empire, conquering and waging invasions of entire systems, exterminating or enslaving the local races and using the materials to fund it's conquest of more systems, all the while having a clear goal to reach once more: The ability to have entire fleets conquer the whole of Time. That is where the Dalek Paradigm Empire should be at this stage of the story, conquering systems and returning to being a more linear-time Empire while having individual Daleks and Dalek Squads for Time-orientated operations where the Doctor is involved.

4. The Doctor - In a word, with the events of Asylum, the Daleks will start to branch a little bit at a time into time-raiding and maybe even sending a fleet or two through the Vortex.

3 - **The Triumvirate of the Empire**

Now that we have the goals and methods of the Empire out of the way, a leader and/or council, and a set of responisibilities. I'll state the sector of the Empire each third is responsible for, and who calls the shots in each. All three of the Sectors need the others to succeed yet all three have infighting with the other two, the leaders of which are in practically open competition so that the overall Dalek Paradigm Empire has no single ruler or group of rulers working in tandem, but works forward due to the most efficient or succesful strategy or strategist finding it's way to the surface.

First Sector - **Internal - Imperial Control - Led by The Parliament of the Daleks**

This is the core of the Empire, resource collection, creation of infrastructure, defense from attackers for colony worlds, and any other issue that may arise. Of course, the Parliament alone doesn't make up this sector but it is the ultimate power in the First Sector. The Parliment itself is made of individual Daleks, called ""Consuls"" whose worth has been proven in it's field, or a Scientist successfully creating a new type of defense system for an entire planet. These Daleks may come from any of the Three Sectors, though a Dalek Consul who speaks aloud about a topic to the rest of the Parliament is the equivilent of our MPs shouting at each other over rabble in the Houses of Parliament. The Parliament is also unique in that the members are turned over most, it is not the rule.

Second Sector - **External - Invasion Force - Led by the Dalek Emperor**

This Sector probably seems a lot more exciting than Daleks deciding the tax on bins, and armies are commanded by an elite group of strategists and generals who are lead by the Dalek Emperor, a ruthless and strategic Dalek who is permenantly sealed inside a battle computer casing in the spearhead ship of the Empire's fleet. I see this Emperor less as the Parting of the Ways Emperor and more like the Emperor from Evil of the Daleks, physically it looks as if he is a spider in the center of a web, waiting and planning each strike with a cunning viciousness. The Emperor is always there at the Vanguard of any and all invasions, stragegizing and ordering forces around initially and then waiting in silence as the invasion goes off successfully. A noteworthy thing about the Emperor is that instead of multiple Emperors or a successive line of Emperors, the Emperor is constant, the Emperor was originally the first Supreme from Victory of the Daleks) The Dalek army in itself is naturally strong either invading systems by force

Third Sector - **Scientific - Imperial Technological Development -- Led by Head Scientist** *

The Third Sector is less focused on the Empire as a whole machine and more of the cogs that make the machine. The Third Sector is the overarching term for the Dalek groups scattered across the Empire, and on specialised research outposts, who research and discover all the Empire's technology. From manufacture of Dalek Casings to researching weaponry to even attempts at Time Travel, the Third Sector develops, manufactures and researches everything the Empire needs, which is then put into practice by the First or Second Sectors depending on what the technology is.

As you'll see, it could be one of three ideas for the Third Sector. The First, and perhaps most obvious, is Davros. He's always seen as a scientist, and he's often seen in direct competition with the Emperor or Supreme he's up against. But, I don't think we'll see Davros anytime soon, or at least not as a regular enough to give this position to him. The lead scientist could be a single Dalek, similar to the Cult of Skaro

_____________________________________________________________

Presumably if you're reading the Doctor Who subreddit then you like the show. That said

For me:

**1)** Quit using [deus ex machina](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus_ex_machina) ALL THE TIME. It seems that over half the episodes since the reboot have ditched creating satisfying plot resolutions in favour of making-shit-up-as-we-go-along. A good ending should make me go: ""Ahhh


**2)** Try and tone down the cringe a little. I have nothing against emotional scenes, but Russel's scripts often seem to descend into what I would expect from a doctor who fan fiction, with [this scene](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdeF8eg8bIU) summarising perfectly almost everything I didn't like about his writing style.  Having built up tension for three whole episodes, he resolves it by having the public chanting 'doctor' repeatedly, only to have the doctor begin flying, sprouting some science jargon at the master, who has at this point become some whimpering disney-like villain, and hard to watch.


**3)** This goes to Moffat: usually a good idea executed with simplicity is better than tons of good ideas shoehorned into one episode.  One of your greatest strengths as a Doctor Who writer is your ability to come up with tons of imaginative ideas and obscure ideas, as the Doctor's death scene and Amy's discoveries made the plot feel bitty and less satisfying.


**4)** This also goes to Moffat: Stop writing all your female protagonists the same. It's not that I don't like women who are feisty, it seems with every passing episode the script seems to incorporate an increasing amount of one liners into the dialogue, and recently its as if entire conversations can just be a string of witty one liners. Whilst this is often highly entertaining, it does somewhat destroy any realism and can make situations less believable.


**5)** And just to reiterate what every fan has already screamed a thousand times already

This seems like a big difference between Davies era and Moffat era stories. Moffat seems to rarely kill groups of civilians. In fact

If this is the case, I find it a bit disconcerting character-wise that the Doctor didn't seem to care much when it happened. The deaths were barely mentioned or noticed and quickly forgotten.

One thing people noticed about Doctor Malpractice (or whatever you want to call him) was his outfit.  It seems to be an amalgam of McGann and Eccleston's garbs, and actually is the one who ends it.  But what if it is more than that?

A while back I read a fan webcomic called ""The Ten Doctors"", and at one point, there's a whole ""Journey to the Center of the Mind"" in which all the minds of all the incarnations of the Doctor merge together into one telepathic representation of the Doctor.

We've also heard it said that the Valeyard is the aggregation of all the negativity of the Doctor incarnated in a single body.  You probably see where I'm going with this.

Well, well, not a good place to be.  Millions were dying, being erased from history, being written back in, only to be killed again.  However, it was also a war ACROSS time, being clever while trying to fight the war, but we'll burn that bridge when we come to it).  But having multiple Doctors on hand is not enough to solve the problem of the war, ""Hey

Only they don't.  The creation, his endless potential lifetimes, does not end up creating a kindly, benevolent wizard who can just solve the war with a wave of his hand and have everybody live.  Because war isn't that easily solved.  This amalgamation turns out to be ruthlessly pragmatic, authoritarian, cold.  He attempts to solve the war turn out to be far worse than the war itself.  And its not just his actions that terrify the later unmerged Doctor.  The fact that his sum total ends up as a complete monster terrify him, shakes him to his core.  After all

And that's who Hurt is.  He is ALL of the Doctors that ever were, and never existed, all rolled into one ruthlessly pragmatic package.

1362439965.0,19o4ck,"My theory regarding The Question, Silence Will Fall, and the 'Doctor Who?' arc.",Conzilla88,53,32, so let's see how it goes.

Right

My theory is that The Doctor and Clara will end up on the Fields of Trenzalore at some point very soon, I do not know. But, think about it; since ""The Wedding of River Song"" The Doctor has been erasing himself from every data bank in the universe. Even 'Future Oswin' deleted the Daleks' memory of him, he is becoming more and more unknown throughout the universe. This HAS to be leading to something, and as always with Moffat, it probably is.

I think that when The Doctor reaches the Fields of Trenzalore, also questioning ""Doctor Who?"". This includes River Song, who at this point does not know The Doctor's name. Yet.

Now, the one thing that could not be taken away from him, and has so much meaning, his entire identity, and sacrificed it by using it (somehow) to lock the Time War. Now, how do you unlock a lock? You use the same key. That's right, his name will unlock the Time War.

BUT, he KNOWS that for her to know his name, HE would have to have said it, meaning that at some point in his future the Time War will be completely unlocked.

SO, unlocking the Time War, as no one else will know his name and be able to answer it for him. The tragedy then comes from the fact that it was The Doctor's own doing that has lead him to this. He has been erasing himself from data banks everywhere, causing knowledge of him to become lost.

Now, and it MUST fall to protect the universe from whatever horror's the Doctor's greatest secret hides. The hypothetical phrase could be 'Silence must fall or the universe will perish' or something like that. This is why THE Silence (religious order) and Silents (alien race) want to kill him, to STOP the unlocking of the Time War.

TL;DR The Doctor will unlock the Time War by answering the Question

A friend of mine on FB posted the following:

&gt; A while back
&gt; His response was ""Not AN episode
&gt; I will be very surprised if dude isn't the new Master.

My initial reply was along the lines of ""Yeah, and a regret that Derek Jacobi didn't get more screen time as The Master.

The following is my reply, took me a while to type and proof, and there's no funny pictures about how my SO got me something remotely DW related, so there's that out of the way.

I agree wholeheartedly on seeing Derek Jacobi being the Master for longer. He was a fresh spin on this older styling of The Master, sympathy, kindness, or love in his body for anything other than sheer chaos. For the parts he was playing The Master, I expected a pontification scene like no fucking other, because it was the kind of Master Jacobi was playing and goddamnit it would have been glorious. Not so much with Simm.

The thing with Simm is that he obviously took the same spastic, they were even prone to the same type of insane outbursts, but whereas The Doctors was ultimately rooted in benevolence and the want to help, The Master is the exact opposite, evil, dark, fucking horrible

That's why I think John Simm's portrayal of The Master was so beautiful: he was the consummate yang to David Tennant's yin

Which brings me to The End of Time.

Both of these episodes weren't just about The Doctor regenerating into Eleven and us mourning Ten. The more background of it? They explained just WHY The Master is such a bastard. And it's not because of something trifle, it's because of Rassilon and being too goddamned proud and fucked up to not warp a child in to his own puppet. What we saw happen with the White-Point Star diamond was momentary, a fleeting gesture by a corrupt Lord President to further his mission. The deeper implication of that almost casual tossing of the diamond meant centuries of pain, problems, and heartache for everyone involved. Fucking predestination paradox'.

We saw why The Master was so fucked up, the implication was there, that some Time Lords looked at The Untempered Schism and went mad, but what I took from it was that The Master went mad because of the drumbeat, not the actual viewing of the Schism. And I just felt sorry for him, he got fucked royally and there wasn't a thing that could be done....

Until he shoved Ten out of the way and fought down his demons, the focus, the main character, putting The Doctor in the backseat without him having resolved anything other than shooting the generator, and we TOTALLY forgot that Wilf was in that glass box for just a second, and we thought we were gonna have Ten for a little while longer. When the Time Lock closed back around all of them, that was it for The Master.

We had his reasoning for everything he'd ever done, even if you want to say it was solely based on that moment and wasn't a complete turn of character for him. I'd like to think that if he had stayed he might've started on the path of redemption somehow before burning out entirely, but that's getting in to Fanfic territory pretty fast.

I love the character of The Master, but it'd sully the actions of The End of Time. You could turn him in to a sort of anti-hero, but that'd be cheap too. Knowing Grand High Moff, he'll pull something brilliant out of his ass, because I truly hope he does, my expectations are really, really high for it all.
