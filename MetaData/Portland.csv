Conversely, if a small dog who is not on a leash rushes a larger dog on a leash and gets attacked, that is on the owner of the unleashed dog. It's in our nature to see our dogs as different or better mannered than other dogs, but nobody should be put in the stressful situation of hearing ""Don't worry, he's friendly!"" as another dog bears down on you. Please forgive me if I don't take your word for it.

The beer is average at best.  They may have been a microbrew leader many years ago, but then the company doesn't ever reward those efforts.  They could select some of these better beers to brew all over, at least for a limited time.  What is the incentive for their brewers to produce anything but the same old-same-old?   

The wines are absolute crap.  Yes

And their food lacks any of the originality that their individual locations seem to scream for.  

I would so love to take out of town guests to some of their more interesting locations

What do you guys think?  Is it just me



**EDIT:**  I did send an email with a link to the thread.  I got a reply back from Lars Raleigh, but that is expected in this format, imo).  I got the sense that they were surprised at the general tone of the conversation, since their continued success hasn't given them any indication that they are failing in any way.  He also said that their brewers are actually doing some very creative things right now.  I admit, it's been a while since I've been to one (outside of Science Pub, but I generally don't drink or eat at those), so maybe I should give them a second chance.  

Perhaps we all should.  If anyone finds anything new, please tell /r/Portland.  Probably in a new thread, as this one is getting long and those comments might get buried.  And let them know either way.  They have a customer feedback link on their website.

Biking on busy streets that don't have bike lanes when there are perfectly safe, and you should stick to roads with fewer of them to make everyone happy.

After my first 5-hour shift, that's fine... I'm just learning the POS and tagging along with drivers, I don't deserve tips yet, I didn't do anything to earn them. I find myself scrubbing dishes for minimum wage, cursing this economy and my inability to find a job in my field (which I have worked in for the last six years for a good salary, until I was laid off in March).

Fast forward to a week and a half later. I have now been delivering pizzas on my own and ringing up customers in the meantime. I have been using my own car to do this as well

Fast forward to the end of the two weeks period. That night, and ""suck it up"". So here I am, broke, driving my own car, spending my own (non-existent) money on gas, doing the same job as everyone else who is getting paid... but none for me.

I ask my supervisor how long this is going to go on for, yet all of the money was going to my supervisors and I was being sent home empty handed.

The next day, with someone else pocketing every single one of my hard-earned tips, and then I was dumped.

To top it all off

What a gross business practice

That's my rant. Had to get that off my chest. 

EDIT: Wow, though -- **I hope it goes without saying, but please, nobody call them or harass them or try to fight this for me!** I really hope anyone who suggested that is just joking. I'm sure they are, right? Either way, it feels great to know that you guys hate when one of us gets screwed just as much as I do. Cheers!

EDIT #2: I WAS given a mileage log, and with not receiving tips, I was pretty broke and could barely keep gas in my car in order to make deliveries. In the end, I was let go before I could ever turn in the mileage log anyway.

Edit #3: No response on friday. Will try again Monday and keep updated...

Edit #4, who I had only interacted with upon being hired and being fired... he was never ever in the store for any of the shifts I worked. 

I'm being told it was because I questioned taking the last two deliveries, once again, I would not be receiving tips that night, I did question whether I should be taking deliveries on my own if I was still ""training"". I hardly think this was a fireable offense because I certainly did not become confrontational or refuse to take deliveries, but the incident report he read to me makes it seem like I outright refused to take some deliveries, besides one sentence near the end that says ""He took the final deliveries"". It seems that the manager just wanted me gone once I started questioning why I wasn't receiving tips, and there's very little I can do about that.

I will be given tips for the shifts I worked,,False,self,t5_2qi2i,1340060554.0,,True

* If you are in their [service area](http://www.portlandalliance.com/downtown_services/district-map.html), but have no authority to arrest.  They are there to move people along, write reports and call the cops if it gets too bad.
* If the person is in a park downtown
* If the drunk is hanging outside a particular bar
* Use a combination of the pink noise at http://simplynoise.com/ and a fan. I found that combination block out all but the most egregious drunktards.


**Trouble On The Streets**

* I lived and worked downtown plus walked everywhere I went for the time I lived there.  I only had one full-blown altercation in all that time and could have avoided that if I'd chosen too.  Don't expect any trouble but be aware of your surroundings.  You are more likely to encounter annoyances rather than an actual problem on the streets of downtown.
* Also call clean and safe if there is a part of downtown that needs to be cleaned
* IF you run into trouble downtown
* Use the numbers above for non-911 problems.  I only had to call 911 once.


**Annoyances**

* Panhandlers.  There are days I would get hit up for change 20 times or more.  If the person is aggressive, then I started saying ""sorry"" when they asked, then I put in earbuds and pretended not to hear them even if I had no music on, the I dropped the pretense and just ignored them unless they were offensive... I'm sure on bad days I told a couple to get fucked but there was really no need for that.  PLEASE do NOT give panhandlers money.  I'm could write a novel about this, homelessness in Portland, services and ways of really helping these people.  The change is perpetuating all sorts of problems.  I will address this in the comments if needed.
* Chuggers AKA ""Charity Muggers"".  These are the people that stand on the corner and ask you if you want to help the whales or orphaned children.  I've dealt with them in the same way I've dealt with panhandlers.  Once the rainy season ends


**The Up-Side**

* Too much to list here really
* You are living in a really fucking cool city
* Just going for a short walk can be quite an experience.  You never know what you will see
* There is a lot to see and do on foot.  Get out and enjoy the parks, bars and more.  
* Remember all the great stuff and try to focus on that when some wino decides to pick a fight with a newspaper vending machine at 3 in the morning.

UPDATE (12/22/12 - 16:51 PST): THE TURKEY HAS ARRIVED! Thanks again to Singer07!

Gaming should start around noon. If you want to come by earlier (and be tortured with stupid videos I have)

If you do come over (and can afford it)

So no need to be alone during christmas. Come celebrate with fellow redditors. :)

EDIT: Side note. No booze. If you want to drink before you come over

EDIT PART DUEX: Please also note we do have a cat. So anyone who is allergic, we would like to avoid that.

EDIT THE LAST: Just an FYI. We have a couch (seats 3) and 4 sittable chairs. This means that we have exactly enough seats for everyone. If you have some foldable chairs

EDIT RETURN OF THE EDIT: Ok. I'm locking it in at 5 people coming. We have seating for 7, perhaps next year (Yes, I hope to do this every year or even perhaps during the year).

A Community Call to Action

Across the country, sons and daughters, husbands and wives working hard to support our families.   We have been speaking out for good jobs with decent pay, regular hours, affordable healthcare and respect, but instead of working with us to make changes, Walmart has attempted to silence and retaliate against us for speaking out.  Our jobs have been threatened, our schedules changed.  Some of us have even been fired.   We will not be silenced.  Throughout the holiday season, and we hope that you will stand with us.  

Your Support Is Critical

It is not an easy decision, and we hope you will join us in creative, non-violent action in solidarity with our strike.  We ask that supporters take action that spreads the word about our strikes and demonstrates to Walmart a wave of support for workers who are speaking out. 

We will not be silenced until we see real change at Walmart. 
-- OUR Walmart

When: Thursday

Where: Walmart on 82nd between Powell and Holgate


If you are able - come out and support!

I've also created /r/restorethefourthpdx  which I thought may help us predditors out.

[Here is the pdf of SB1534](http://www.leg.state.or.us/12reg/measpdf/sb1500.dir/sb1534.intro.pdf)

[Here is where you can track SB1534 as it *continues* to move through the Oregon Legislature](http://gov.oregonlive.com/bill/2012/SB1534/)

The most disturbing parts
SECTION 1.  { + (1) As used in this section
communication' has the meaning given that term in ORS 133.721.
  (2) A person commits the crime of aggravated solicitation if
with the intent of causing two or more other persons to engage in
specific conduct constituting a crime
electronic communication to command or solicit other persons to
engage in that conduct at a specific time and at a specific
location.
  (3) In a prosecution under this section
prove that the electronic communication was received by specific
persons or that the defendant intended for specific persons to
engage in the criminal activity.**

Possible real world scenario:
You Tweet or Facebook ""I think two or more people should go to Chapman Square and donate money to [insert group claimed to be enemy of the US here]""  Even if you have no friends or followers and no one ever reads your post


Other plausible examples:  
Post: ""I've had it with giant corporations destroying our great country.  We should all occupy Chapman Square tonight at 8pm.  To hell with the fences"".  No one reads this
Post: ""Two or more people should go to Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall tonight at 8pm and record the Portland Symphony in an unauthorized manner.""  Crime. (That's really in there: Section 8

Are you getting that cold

**It is my hope that a good discussion about SB1534 can happen below**  Am I overreacting?  Are my examples not valid?  Am I underreacting- got example of possible interpretations yourself?

**What can be done to stop this?**  [Here's the Bill Tracking link again.](http://gov.oregonlive.com/bill/2012/SB1524/)  Anyone know if there will be more public hearings?  This thing to do is **SHOW UP AND SPEAK AGAINST IT**  Also

And (I'll save you the bold): contact the media.  

Hey Occupy- the bulk of your organization tools are about to be outlawed.  I urge you- just one of you at no specific time or location- to act now.

EDIT: corrected Bill Tracking link (Thanks Dry_Hopped)

Quick story time:

I met James completely out of the blue a few years ago. I had only recently registered an account on reddit

Our hanging session consisted of him taking me out to dinner, giving me an 8th of some amazing green, and commiserating with me about life, relationships, and everything.

Why? ""I just saw your comment and thought you could use a friend.""

That was James in a nutshell.

He truly was one of the most influential persons I have ever met. He just filled me with so much hope for everyone. Looking at some of the recent posts on r/portland and remembering posts detailing how hard it is to ""make friends in this city""

I was just wondering if anyone else may have a story to tell about him as I know he wasn't the only friend he made off of /r/portland that changed my life in a positive way. 

Have stories to tell? Please post them here in this thread. I know he regularly helped out many redditors with whatever.  If you'd like to get details about his memorial. please PM me and I can send you details as things get figured out. 

To everyone

Thanks /r/Portland .

Predditors, you dress appropriately for the occasion. At a funeral, you dress out of respect for another person. Stop thinking about your goddamn fucking selves for just one moment and think about people on a whole. This is about the 99%, not your individualism.

&gt;Washington voters have passed Initiative 502 and beginning on Thursday December 6, like cookies, or 72 ounces of infused liquid, like oil) for personal use. The initiative establishes a one-year period for the State of Washington to develop rules and a licensing system for the production and sale of marijuana.

&gt;While legal in the State of Washington beginning on December 6

&gt;It's important though to understand that under Oregon law

&gt;Possession of Less than One Ounce of Marijuana has been a low law enforcement priority for 35 years in Portland and this will not change due to the new Washington law.

&gt;What is NOT a low law enforcement priority is Driving Under the Influence of Intoxicants (DUII). DUII enforcement remains a high priority for the Portland Police Bureau.

&gt;Much like existing fireworks laws, if it goes high in the air or gets you high, you should probably use it in the Evergreen State.

&gt;Some important questions and answers about the Oregon impact of the new Washington Law:

&gt;- I have an Oregon Medical Marijuana Program card. Can I bring marijuana into Oregon from Washington?

&gt;Yes. The Oregon Medical Marijuana Program allows for card holders to possess certain amounts of marijuana. It does not dictate where card-holders can get it and there are no changes to the Oregon Medical Marijuana Program because of Washington I-502.

&gt;- I live in Washington but drove to Portland to visit friends. Can I carry my marijuana with me?

&gt;No. Possession of Less than One Ounce of Marijuana in Oregon is a violation and you may be subject to a citation

&gt;- Does this mean I can smoke pot in parks or at cafes if I go to Washington?

&gt;No. While Portland Police do not prioritize enforcing the citations of less than an ounce of marijuana, which may eventually lead to the existence of cafes or businesses where smoking pot is allowed. Until then, if you must consume pot, then do so in the privacy of a residence.

&gt;- Can I get a violation for being stoned?

&gt;Unless you are operating a vehicle (bicycles included)

&gt;- What happens if I get pulled over and an officer thinks I've been smoking pot?

&gt;If an officer believes you're driving under the influence of a controlled substance, they can get a search warrant for a blood draw from a judge.

&gt;In a serious injury crash

&gt;It's important to know that Driving Under the Influence IS a criminal offense in Oregon and those driving under the influence of marijuana or other drugs can be arrested and jailed for DUII-Drugs.

&gt;While DUII-Alcohol is generally when a driver's Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) is .08 or more

&gt;The threshold for DUII-Drugs is ""impaired to a perceptible degree.""

&gt;- I really want to go to Washington and get high. What's the safest way to do it?

&gt;Get a designated driver

&gt;- Can I ride my bike to Washington to smoke some weed?

&gt;Yes

&gt;- Will the Feds arrest me in Washington if I buy some weed?

&gt;Marijuana is still a ""Schedule I Drug"" under federal law and marijuana possession and sale remains illegal under federal law. The Portland Police Bureau cannot predict or control the enforcement activities of federal authorities.",self,t5_2qi2i,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/14cr3t/ppb_answers_the_most_important_question_of_the/

I have seen a recent upsurge in mass-downvoting, ESPECIALLY the report button.  It's not a super-downvote, all it does is send a message to the mods to look at the person's comment or post.  95 times out of 100, that comment or post falls within the rules of reddit and r/portland.  So it gets reapproved and nothing changes.  What really bothers me is that a couple users are being targeted specifically, having every comment in a given thread reported.  Not only does this make more work for the mods (well, not work, it takes about 5 seconds to click ""Approve"" four times) but it does nothing towards the person you report.  I'm not going to remove someone's comments just because you don't agree with their opinion.  ONLY USE THE REPORT FEATURE WHEN A PERSON'S COMMENT OR POST IS IN DIRECT VIOLATION OF THE R/PORTLAND RULES OR REDDIQUETTE.

So I want all of you to [read the r/portland rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/qktk3/faq_thread_the_rules/) and [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) again, voting, and reporting ways.

Also, the limit to which we'll extend the rules will be shortened.  This goes especially for negative comments in threads posted by people asking for advice about moving here/jobs/schooling.  If you want to direct those people to the wiki or sidebar, that's fine.  But insults will result in having your comment deleted, and repeat violations will get you banned.  Negative and abusive comments make the entire city and this subreddit look bad.  We already have a reputation on reddit for being populated by xenophobic jerks, let's not prove them right or perpetuate anything.

I know this isn't the majority of you, is that you?)who are making Portland look bad for whatever reasons they have.  So please, try to be a little more courteous and polite.

I don't want to put him down, looking for a loving home in the Portland, OR area (or within a few hundred miles)  [x-post from r/self]",BinguniR34,44

He is a ten year old German Shepherd named Dep. My family got him as a puppy during Spring Break of 2002. We inherited the dog when my parents divorced and each moved on. My sister

We kept the dog and he became a part of our life. I finally got my first piloting job in Oregon last year. We moved with my wife from Oklahoma and brought Dep with us. Hardship ensued

As a pilot, the others would just keep him in a cage for the rest of his life if he does not get adopted. We started considering euthanasia, I don't want to do it, but I think it would be more humane than for him to live the rest of his life in a cage away from his family.

My heart is breaking, smart, loving, loyal dog. He is also very protective and does not like other dogs, at all. He has lived most of his life with cats, so he is capable of getting used to them. He also does shed, right now he is shedding his winter coat and has chunks of hair falling!

We live in the Portland, I hope this pulls at your heart strings and help me out.


TL;DR. New job means we cannot care for our ten year old German Shepherd and we need to find a home for him so we don't have to put him down.",self,t5_2qi2i,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/rrc83/reddit_my_heart_is_breaking_i_have_to_make_the/

If you're looking for cats to adopt or know someone who is...",,154,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/11qbkj/hey_rportland_a_nokill_animal_shelter_i_used_to/

I know there has to be someone out there.  I worked at [Animal Aid](http://www.animalaidpdx.org/) for about half a year and just left.  I worked as a caregiver

I'm sure you're wondering what the problem is, really).

I'll go over the details here:

Names: [Hoagie](http://www.animalaidpdx.org/pets/displayPet.php?candidateId=585) and [Olivia](http://www.animalaidpdx.org/pets/displayPet.php?candidateId=584) (Note: I'm pretty sure Olivia is at least part Bengal

The first one, he is separated when all the cats eat or he'll find food left out.  

The second one, she's extremely sweet.  She is, however, also extremely smart and mischievous. They had to get a special lock for the latched door she was originally in because, after days of trying, she figured out how to unlatch it. 

The only real problem with these two is that they cannot be separated (separating bonded cats can be devastating) and Olivia hates other cats. She's kind of like badass with a heart of gold for her huge dufus buddy Hoagie.  Because of this

They don't actually know I'm making this post as I left them a month ago.  I do know these two still aren't adopted out and having interacted with them multiple times a week

Anyways, Olivia is fun to play with, and Hoagie is just a giant ball of love.

1338421308.0,ucxy8,Reddit Brunch this Sunday! 6/3,Dylzilla,148,28,172,"Hiya Portland

I've posted on here a few times in the past

But one qualm that i've heard a lot about

SO! I want to even the footing by inviting anyone who reads this to come grab brunch with me on Sunday! It will just be myself and any Redditors who read this and want to join, and get to know each other.

Send me a PM, messenger penguin, etc. 

**TL;DR: Come grab brunch with me and other redditors this Sunday (6/3)

*Edit 1: Also, have traveled all over the place, have a rabid obsession with anything Zelda related, I love planning events, I enjoy fitness and exercise regularly, have gone to PAX every year, played WoW an embarassing amount of time, and roasting whole turkeys.*

*Edit 2: (Answering another PM) All ages are welcome to the place I had in mind

*Edit 3: I'll have something to designate our table

*Edit 3.5: I will have a sombrero to designate our table at Montage!*

*Edit 4: In case it hasn't be clarified to the masses

*Edit 5: Also, 6oz. baby Jesus, please bring cash! Card will work, but cash will make the payment process SO much easier. And I think they only do X amount of cards per table. Just something to keep in mind.*

White van, 2 very normal looking white guys with white t-shirts.

It's the craziest shit that's ever happened to me while on my bike or since I've lived in Portland. I spent the entire class afterwards imagining ways I could've Jackie Chan'd them with my u-lock or my bike polo mallets. I'm glad I didn't though. They probably had other tools in the van.

**edit/update:**

I spoke with John from bikeportland and there'll be something posted there about it. I don't plan on taking any other action concerning this, I didn't think that I was in this case.

[RideOn Portland](http://rideonportland.org/) is a designated driver service. So say you drive to a friends Christmas party, then drive you and your car home! No waiting for a late night bus in the rain, no paying for a cab back home then back to your friends house in the morning, no worrying about getting a ticket if you parked downtown. Its a drive home in your own car for $15 (plus tip for your lifesavers).

And since I'm the volunteer coordinator I can't go without asking for more volunteers. We need at least 5 volunteers each night to operate under the demand for our service. As I said above

So! If you're drinking and need a ride from us

If you want to volunteer with us

Off they go, which I ignored. 

This morning I woke up to a voice mail from the driver: ""I got her home, shut the door, locked it, and wouldn't answer to pay me. I have her keys, I left them in the Radiocab Supervisors office at the central garage. If you know how to get a hold of her tell her where they are.""

However

I write this as my wife was run into (again) today while walking home on 39th. The biker, and there is no way to move without going into traffic. To move we would have had to dive into the bushes, or stepped into the street - in traffic moving 35mph.

 Anyhow, people shouting in public at each-other. We shouldn't have had to have a face-off there on 39th about right-of-ways. There shouldn't be a girl with a bleeding leg as a result.

I'm a biker... and a walker... and as both I have to say that pedestrians getting forced off sidewalks on the busier streets by bikers is becoming an epidemic.  It seems every time we walk down 39th

Please.... fellow riders, this means that sidewalks are not acceptable zones if Pedestrians are present, and the Pedestrian always has the right-of-way.

How's it going? I'm sorry for the slow reply. I'm still thinking about how we can help each other. Perhaps we can come up with some revenue sharing agreement if we help promote PDX Pipeline on /r/portland. I'd like to think about something we can do in 2012. I believe that /r/portland is one of the most popular Portland forums on the Internet. On average we receive 10

Hello

It's an interesting idea for sure. Let us know when you'd like to discuss this and we can meet up for coffee or a beer and discuss it.

**December 5**

I have a few ideas off the top of my head. The first would be a sponsored permalink on the sidebar. The second is that we could have a section on our popular sidebar for when you have a special event or promo that deserves extra attention. Another idea is that for certain events.. perhaps we could generate interest in PDXpipeline by offering giveaways for some of the tickets that you always offer on your site and have an insertion order for how long these promos or giveaways would run on the sidebar. I'm sure we can come up with some other ideas. I created r/portland several years ago and it's just grown so large. It's a good way to reach local people of a certain genre that are impossible to reach by more traditional advertising means.

I think the PDXpipeline is one of the best event sites on the web for Portland. There have been a few which have launched over the last year like BePortland.com
