1343675130.0,xelhu,[SUGGESTION] Why we should be able to spawn on our friends.,ChilledDragon,357,66,101,"Ok, right? **WRONG**

I play video games to have fun. While MineZ is sadistically fun, but I have some pros about why it would increase the fun factor of MineZ. 

1. It would allow groups of people to get into the fun of MineZ (Giants

2. With the right balancing

3. Spawning on friends would rid the long time of walking from Grimdale to Romero to get to your friend. This

Now

1. Players can only use the ability within the first 3 minutes of spawning.

2. You can only spawn on friends if they are within a certain distance near the coast (~200m)

3. Instead of simply using /minez spawn HighlifeTTU and spawning on Highlife, accept with /yes or decline with /no"" 

4. Now you may be thinking, Highlife can put in the command /requestsoff to disable requests, and then when Lazer wants to spawn on him, he uses /requestson to allow Lazer to send him the request.

5. You wouldn't spawn right onto the recipient

While this could get instantly shoved away

Either way

1344285599.0,xs9cf,"""I wasn't cheating!""  Why we are confident that you were.",HighlifeTTU,227,33,155,"The administration for MineZ comes from a background of administrating on a very popular hardcore factions server.  People are constantly trying to find new hacked clients or exploits to give them an unfair advantage.  We are used to this

One of the things I tell every admin on the team is that no ban should be handed out unless you have 100% confidence.  This is why we won't ban on anything but clear evidence (video proof / clear screen shots), and I don't want myself or my team handing out wrongful bans.

But that all being said, but let me be clear that since so many bans are getting placed on this we have THOROUGHLY tested the detection.  Even under our best efforts, and by creating artificial lag on our connections, we cannot even get close to hitting the auto critical flag limit.  It is, quite frankly, impossible to flag unless you are using a hacked client.  I have never seen it flag, and visually looked at someone and said ""nope, I've watched the user and verified visually that they are using a hacked client.  To further ensure we are making good bans, they are very good at developing anticheat measures.  We roll out anticheat measures regularly

Now for those of you who are banned from this, consider that the vast majority of players in MineZ play with a legit client.  They are the ones who lose their hard work because a select few decide they can't play fair.  In my eyes this is unacceptable, and the reason we are very strict in our policies and very rarely give a second chance to those users identified to have a hacked client.

In short, and we know exactly what lag looks like versus hacked client usage.  On a final note, I'd like to point out that every month or two a huge list of thousands of compromised Minecraft accounts is published to the web.  How do you think those people get their passwords found out?  Not only do you risk getting banned in MineZ, you risk having your Minecraft account compromised.

I'm sure the administration will need to continue to echo this point as more people are caught and banned,False,self,t5_2ubcv,1344285982.0,,developerred format,t3_xs9cf

Please report it to minezsmp@gmail.com. It is much more convincing to receive multiple unrelated reports on a player than to have an entire witchhunt thread with 135+ comments. Thank you for your diligence

To you who choose to cheat:

There is no second chance, you choose getting caught, you choose getting banned, and you make that choice yourself.

Cheating here is nothing but a big middle finger to myself and the entire development team

1. You are bypassing the rules of the game that we have worked so hard to put in place.

2. You are ruining the experience for other players

3. You are wasting our time. We happen to feel that a player deserves the best investigation before a ban is put in place

If you believe in this mod in any way, that's a whole new kind of low.

Keep those things in mind.

I'm back from my vacation and even though I enjoyed some R&amp;R the rest of the team was hard at work on our latest feature.  We've been working for a while to find a way to award things to non-premium members while still giving benefits to premium players for supporting the server.  We also wanted to make a fun ""meta game"" in the network

**What is it?**

Essentially, or slaying the Ghost in Ghostcraft.  This also has the added benefit of allowing us to take your precious XP to discourage behavior, such as team killing in Wasted.  

**What can I do with the points?**

Spend them!  You can spend the points to unlock kits in Ghostcraft, then pick the bonuses that you want as opposed to what we think you deserve.  We may eventually have lobby items and vanity things, just for those of you who are good at the mode.  Want a Ghostcraft head to wear around Lobby?  Yeah, that'll be possible.

**How does it work?**

It is all web driven.  Our new website is nearly complete

**How does this affect premium and non-premium?**

For non-premium members this is huge.  You can now unlock everything on the network (besides private servers/reserve slots) by playing your favorite games.  For premium folks, yes, but it will be possible.  We feel this rewards players who can't afford the network but still choose to play our games and (hopefully) tell their friends how much they love us.  For those players who currently have unlocks in MineZ or Ghostcraft, those unlocks will remain unchanged.  For those that don't, you will just need to earn the XP to unlock them once the system rolls live.

Let me stress one thing very quickly.  WE WILL NOT BE TAKING ANY BENEFITS AWAY FROM PREMIUM MEMBERS.  If you have kits unlocked in LMS or Ghostcraft

**Wait

Yep.  So for instance, then use it to give yourself some temporary/permanent benefits in MineZ.  

Another perk.  Lets say you are an iron clad warrior in MineZ who has survived for weeks.  When death comes (and you know it will come eventually) you can use the experience you racked up to pick the perks YOU want.  With our current achievement system, achievements will award experience instead and allow you to save up that experience for the day you finally meet your maker.  Feeling lucky? Blow all your experience and really deck yourself out on spawn.  However, if you die you'll know you've got a lot of XP collecting to do to replenish your precious supply.  This also allows us to modify behavior.  You'll earn XP quicker by working together / killing zombies.  Want to grind to that permanent extra water bottle on spawn? Find some buddies in Romero and start dishing out hate to those nasty zombies.

**When does this happen

Why, we will go through our remaining games modes and convert it over to the XP system.  So, soon!  If you guys wondered why there have been a lack of Wasted updates lately, its because we've been plugging away at the new website! 

**Feedback**

I am personally very excited for this system.  It opens up a ton of possibilities.  It allows us to reward our long standing non-premium community members while still giving our premium folks an accelerated experience.  On top of that, we are all ears.

EDIT: I originally wanted to post this on April Fools as to completely confuse you guys

When a player dies they spawn a zombie (unless they are near a spawn point)

Right now the equation goes:

Player + Death = Zombie + Player's inventory scattered on the ground.


---

What if I made it

Player + Death = Zombie w/ player's inventory to drop when killed

If a zombie has an inventory for a certain amount of time without dying I remove it. This has a few awesome effects:

1. The awesomeness of actually feeling like the player turned into a zombie

2. Cleaning up item drops without artificially scanning and destroying them

3. Giving players a reason to kill zombies because you don't know which ones carry that awesome loot!

4. Removing a motivation to spawn kill because zombies do not spawn  near a spawnpoint

so ive been banned for using a hacked client (i'm admitting to it) i was trying out Nodus on the zombies (didn't even work well by the way), get critical hits or anything, so i didnt bother turning the hacked client off and going back to narmal minecraft... so yeah please unbann me my ign is CaptKnuckles (also this has noting to do with the ban request, but does the site not show my record, i killed 83 zombies (no cheats) and i wanted to brag, but yeah do you need to donate to get records?)

also just as a question, also i did have fun :P

- [–] to CaptKnuckles from CaptKnuckles via  /r/MineZ/  sent 2 hours ago

all im saying is there should be a sign saying ""no hacked clients"" or something because the hacked client didnt even work (thats why i didnt bother removing it), and brightness (that can also be changed in the normal options menu)), so why bann for it?

- [–] to CaptKnuckles sent 2 hours ago

Because you are a cheater.

- [–] to NikiTesla from CaptKnuckles via  /r/MineZ/  sent 2 hours ago

Oh yeah, and you die with chain armor or better, you spawn with it, and you can drop it but no one can pick it up in the spawn room, but i somehow still had it one time when i typed ""/minez spawn"" (they see it too btw)

- [–] from CaptKnuckles via  /r/MineZ/  sent 1 hour ago

you dont get what im saying basically 1. its not really cheating if theres no perks to it 2. you should have some warnings or something
also im not really whining or anything, theres no links or anything on the site, and theres not even something on the site that says your going to get permabanned for ""cheating"" + you defiantly shouldnt get permabanned for ""cheating"" because doesnt the server automatically ban you for using a hacked client? instead you should have it so it bans you for a month or something thats so easy to mess up with and fix. (there should at least be a way to get yourself unbanned, also Reddit sucks, you should use minecraft forums or planet minecraft as the contact page, this site is way too confusing)

- [–] to CaptKnuckles from NikiTesla [M]via  /r/MineZ/  sent 1 hour ago

There is a tip that shows every 5 minutes that specifically says that if you use a hacked client you will be banned from every minez server.

- [–] from CaptKnuckles via  /r/MineZ/  sent 1 hour ago

also as an observation you seem very conceited, they dont know they are breaking the rules if you dont tell them the rules first.), yup i just dissed you because you are very pompous (all of you are, you are acting like youve got better things to do, your on this blank site skimming threads typing as little as possible, and looking down on everyone.) Also no need to respond, im not going back on this site
-the ""cheater""
 P.S. all honesty: im not aggravated, you guys have just been extremely unhelpful admins/mods/whatever you are (your like the people behind the counters at inner city hospitals).

- [–] to NikiTesla from CaptKnuckles via  /r/MineZ/  sent 1 hour ago

The tips ive seen are- the giant one and kill whoever, get away from the safe zone, and there are better goods up north, i have never once seen a tip saying anything about hacked clients, if i had do you think i would have been using a hacked client? and even if there is, no one reads the tips, they are running from zombies and people (the only way they do read tips is if they go afk in the spawn, it should definatly be on a sign in the spawn, or contact policy). I dont mind being permabanned

- [–] to CaptKnuckles from CaptKnuckles via  /r/MineZ/  sent 1 hour ago

also im actually signing off now, goodbye gayboys, and as a lil' hint people would be way less ragey towards you if you didnt have answers like you do now, you should say something like ""its the rules do"", or ""ill see what i can do"" and do nothing, not just put obvious close minded statements like No. or Because you are a cheater. or Nope. Hope you had fun, you're not coming back.

You showed up to our server with a hacked client.

You expect some soft, hopefully you can learn not to cheat in the future.

---

This is our hardnosed stance on hacking on MineZ in action. We only ban when we are absolutely sure the player is cheating. This is usually the result.

I will say it again: We do not tolerate hacked clients on MineZ. Anytime that I have felt inclined to give a second chance to a hacked client user it has come back to bite me later. Do not hack on MineZ or you will be permanently banned.",self,t5_2ubcv,1345707482.0,,developer format,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/MineZ/comments/yop1y/a_typical_ban_appeal/

Most of the [BUG] posts have already been answered by devs, because they can't find the OP.

Most of the [QUESTION] threads (diamond armor, release date, etc.) have the same problems as the  bug reports: been answered, answer buried.

I've seen so many [SUGGESTION] posts that are extremely similar to each other

My suggestion here is simple in theory:

1. Make a dedicated [SUGGESTION] thread, the builders will probably get more feedback.

2. Make a dedicated [BUG] thread for the same. If devs only have to check the new comments on one thread, they might be able to provide more information and help the devs out that way.

3. I know MineZ has an 'unoffical wiki', they can do a quick scroll through the FAQs before posting theirs, and wouldn't have to worry about not finding it by searching due to peoples' vague wording.

That said - I know you guys are going to have a lot of questions and are going to be so excited you can't contain yourselves so let me go ahead and answer these questions for you.

Here is what has been determined so far - granted nothing is final and the MMORPG is still a ways off but I'm going to get buried in questions if I don't answer them now.

1. The Name: Unavowed

2. The Map Size: 22

3. # of Playable Races: 11 - each one getting a 2000 x 2000 
homeland.

4. # of players at the same time: 10

5. Will you have a system for guilds/clans? Yes.

6. Dungeons

7. How will weapons work? So any character will be able to pick up and use most of the weapons in the game. So we aren't taking hammers away from spell casters or anything like that. Infact depending on the weapon you hold in your hand decides how it acts. So using the above example - with a staff you might shoot fireballs from the end of your staff .. and then switch to a hammer and then your fireball skill changes and now suddenly instead of shooting fireballs out of the end you can now slam the hammer into the ground creating huge earthquakes that stun enemies or as it slams into the ground ripples fire outwards. Play how you want to - not how other RPG's have forced you to play.

8. Will I be able to have player storage or anything like that? Yes - this is probably the coolest part of the game. So you will be able to purchase land, etc to go inside. So for example - let's say you the player decide you want to start your own bank. You'll actually be able to get a bank outer shell design of a house. Then set up a counter, vault, etc inside and then physically open your door and climb behind the counter and lock it and let people pay you to keep their items for storage. I'm looking at you Platypus! What's that - you want to be a merchant and start your own store? Sure - snap up some land, buy yourself a stand and go travel to the cheaper areas of the map - buy potions for low .. take them to the big city to your shop and sell them to other players for profit. There is nothing stopping you. The sky is the limit on how you run your business or what you do with your land. Are you a 500+ member clan and want a giant clan hall with a unique floor or statue using your symbol - it will all be possible with the Unavowed land system. 

Go anywhere

I know you're going to want to see some pictures - so featured here are some screenshots of an old Aslan ruins. The Aslan are a lion based magic race who focus in healing

I know you public players are eyeing those free spaces on the private servers hungrily, but tearing down a private server to make it public does two things:

1. Reduces the number of private servers for those who spent money to get access (some players like playing on a 4 players server...) 

2. Increases the load on the server and the backing database

I mean really? All these things I am showing you just shows how shit the community is. And no I am not doing this for attention, but MineZ has become ClanZ. 

And yes, but I was not even good enough for that. And for anyone wondering, I am dealing with depression IRL. But anyways, I met a few good people along the way, like Beast2x, Foxace36, Zpapz, all the staff
Yes I may return for next map, like all of the Clique besides one or two of them. It sucks that I am leaving on a bad note, but oh well. I hope you guys can find more fun in MineZ than I did in the past few months. It is a great server, but when you have played since June, it gets a bit boring. I will still play other Shotbow games, like HCF and Smash. I will still browse this subreddit, and I most likely won't read the comments on this post. Honestly, and how could I forget? I ""bought my friends"" according to half the Clique. I guess none of you will miss me then. Goodbye guys.

I have no idea what can and can't be done with server side only modding

I was thinking about a way to level out the playing field with respect to Bandits and thought

So
/minez bounty playername

This would put your currently equipped item or stack up as a bounty on 'playername's head?. When you run the command

- If you've been killed, or you'll have to bide your time to have your revenge.

- When a bounty is placed on someone

- Each player could only have one bounty out on someone else at a time

- If you are killed/die

- Running '/minez bountylist' would show you currently logged in players who have a bounty on their head and what the bounty is (including a percentage value for damage - you'd be pissed if a diamond sword offered up as bounty only had 2 hits left in it)

Think it could actually add a whole new way of playing the game - set yourself up as a bounty hunter and see what loot you can get that way...

Say there is a rare item in the same category as iron shovels where you may receive a wooden shovel. Left clicking on a person would cause them to take no damage, and cause one random item to drop from the person you are pickpocketing (I would prefer from the hotbar, but if that is overpowered, from the entire inventory). You could only pickpocket one person one time every 30-60 seconds, to prevent someone from draining an entire inventory. 

This would create a more thriving crime environment in the world. As of right now, and Bandit. The thief would be able to fit right in between Survivor and Bandit as not being so severe as a murderer, but not a good act either. It would also create the possibility for silent crime, just like real pickpockets. Someone may not notice that suddenly they are missing an item, or may not notice they took ""damage"".

They cant defend themselves

This is how it would work.

**On Spawn**: On spawn, and actually get to explore. your survivor active is taken away for 7 seconds after eating and drinking, and can be countered by a hero (a new class i suggest below)

**Bandit** You become a bandit after gaining 6 kill stacks. killing a hero, you become a bandit. The only way to remove yourself from bandit status is to kill six bandits, removing the six kill stacks. Remember, once you become a bandit, you gain the six stacks until you kill 6 bandits. If you kill one and only have 5 stacks, you are still a bandit. You need to remove all stacks.

**Bandit Buffs**: As a bandit

* Thievery: Upon killing a hero

This would bring a new way to play to MineZ. Banditss and heros are opposites. Bandits go at it alone with more suppliess

* Fleeing Death: Upon reaching below 3 hearts

This could be edited to fit more of a last resort kinda active. The scaling may be a bit low

**Bandit Debuffs**: These are debuffs that you receive for becoming a bandit. This should make it so people actually think before choosing who to be. 

* Loneliness: When out of range from another bandit for 30 seconds

This would force bandits to be near each other at times. Meaning bandits could end up controlling, all the heroes and healers are at romero.

* Conscience: Your attacks against lone survivors do half a heart less damage after your first attack. Only applies to a single survivor and is lifted when the survivor is out of range

This makes it that much easier for new players to get started. 

**Heroes**: Heroes are the good guys. Heroes provide protection to survivors and healers. If you see a hero, or have distributed 10 items of food to survivors and healers. You lose hero status and gain bandit status if you kill two healers and a hero. As a hero, you gain 3 buffs and one debuff. 

**Hero Buffs** You, you gain three buffs to help you on your journey. However, because of the bandits and the state that MineZ has been left in, your choices to come at a cost. 

* Bravery: Gain increased movement speed when near a bandit above 3 hearts. 

This adds a cat and mouse aspect to the heroes and bandits aspect. The bandits gain more movement speed the lower they are

* Pack: When near another hero and healer

This adds survivability and encourages teaming up

* Increased Healing: Healing potions heal for an extra heart. 

This adds the sustain of traveling far and discovering new places. 

**Hero  Debuffs** You may be a good man or woman, the hardships don't stop there.

* Weakened Immune System: The risk of becoming infected or severely wounded is increased by 8%. 

This encourages that pack mentality to stay with a healer and another hero.

**Healer**: You are a healer. You have devoted your journey to not surviving, you must have distributed 4 instant health potions, or used 4 splash potions of healing to heal others. You loose the title of healer if you kill one hero or two survivors. 

**Healer Buffs**: As a healer, you receive two buffs that greatly help you throughout your journey.

* Health Regeneration: As a healer

This gives healers a great advantage over bandits and heroes. Most people aren't becoming healers because bandits take their potions and kill them. Its time we gave healers something to look forward to. 

* Resistance: Healers take a half heart reduced damage from all bandits and zombies

This makes healers more defensive and gain

First, try again in five minutes!"".  So rather than have a death ban, right now it kicks you on death.

So when you die, you might have to wait a bit to get in.  At least people are entertained by the ""join the public server lotto"" game.  I mean, trying to get in is more fun than sitting on your hands right?  And maybe you get lucky and get in right away.  There will be more public servers at release but for now I'm going to let this sit on the public server a couple days and get feedback.

=====Mindless PvP=====

There is going to be PvP in the game

1. Attacking someone in melee causes sound.  We already have a sound mechanic in game (it is how movement attracts zombies when there isn't a line of sight).  So we just make it so if players engage in combat zombies hear the struggle and come to give free hugs.  This means that if you are someone in Iron and see someone in leather, then you get swarmed by zombies.  But what on earth are you doing near the coast in iron armor?  Probably noob killing, so you likely deserve it.

2. Work on some more cooperative elements.  I'd like to see a standard health pot give the current three hearts, that may eventually lead to a new friend.  This would also give players a roaming medic play style.  I like that.  Means I can give a ""MEDIC!!"" achievement that gives an extra bandage to you on spawn for using your bandages to heal others.

3. I will put in custom code to spawn a giant when Ojo or Y_ankees kill a player

1372869345.0,1hkq6p,[Suggestion] Lockpicking,Seniorjerry,66,6,16,"I just thought that implementing lock picking would add a whole entire new aspect to minez. This would make it so players would have to use a lock pick to open some doors that a button could not. How would it work?

Players would scavenge tool chest for lock picks

Lock picks would be Bone renamed lock pick (it doesn't have to be a bone you get the point)

Once players have found a lock pick the would be able to use it on certain doors that are set to be locked doors.

They would have a 50% chance of opening it and a 50% chance of the lock pick breaking. (Again the percentages could be different you get the point)

This would make it so that certain doors that the admins don't want players using a button on they could make it more difficult for the players to get in.

Notes: The lock pick would only work on certain doors the admins set. The player would right click the door with the lock pick and in chat it would display to that player [This door has no lock/Unlocking door/This lock is to complicated.] After they right click if it displayed Unlocking door a couple seconds later it would either say [Opened lock] and the door would swing open for a minute or two or it would say [lock pick broke] and delete the lock pick from the players inventory. If a player scrolled to a new item or dropped the lock pick in between it saying Unlocking door and door unlocked/lock pick broke it would stop the process. 

Please leave a comment telling me your thoughts and suggestions thanks!

I remember I won the lottery when I killed a zombie below the spire and it dropped a fresh set of iron from the rewards above. I was laughing my ass off because I knew that he must of fell off climbing down the spire. If it was the player zombie mechanics used today the zombie would of just despawn because no one is around the area. No one would have a chance to know of that brave adventurer's story.

If you increase the time player zombies live it will add to the wow factor of Minez. I can not think of a way for this to be abused since you can only make it to the starting towns with the limited time your player zombie will live. It will be like finding a diamond sword in a haystack

Make some more buildings have wood doors instead of cobwebs. Still allow zombies to break open these doors

There has been a lot of crying about clans lately

1. Towns will now spawn zombies more aggressively.
2. Zombie reach has been tweaked VERY slightly.  I mean VERY slightly.  This shouldn't change a ton
3. I've upped the maximum horde size from 5 to 15.  Now
4. Natural zombie spawning turned back on at night.  Previously, which makes little sense.  So, now zombies spawn at night again.  I did, however, tweak the server to spawn these less often.  In a normal MC server you see monster spawns calculated every 1 tick.  So 20 times a second mobs are calculated to spawn.  I moved this to once every couple of minutes.  This means zombies won't constantly be spawning around you, but will show up more often in the forest.  

With this change the zombie to player ratio has gone from 2:1 to 4:1/5:1.

We finally have the map in good shape and the build team will begin a build blitz soon.  The great thing is this can be a ""living map"" in the fact we can release an alpha of it and continue to build while players are testing it.  I am hoping to have something to you guys for initial testing very soon.

But that being said

1. Change of Thirst Mechanic.  Rather than have thirst kill you out right

2. Change of Disease Mechanic.  Along the same lines as thirst

3. Horses.  Yes, and making them have server specific persistence so people can call a server home.

4. Zombie numbers / damage.  You've got guns.  Come on now.  You think I'm going to give you a shotgun and not increase the zombie count greatly?  However

5. Balanced armor types.  I really like the idea of shaking up armor.  One of these would be pros/cons to each armor type with the ability to outfit them.  Since guns do a ton of damage and head shots count, and chain be an in between.  Something along those lines so armor choices come down to preference.  Guns would still be a big deal.  This is the most ""iffy"" thing here, but the suggestion below is a for sure thing I want.

6. Modifiable weapons / armor.  We would start with armor, and craft ceramic plates / others things using a crafting table.  The idea is that you can find your awesome iron armor (Kevlar), but then you'll want to craft some ceramic plates to beef it up.  This would give you additional armor.  Or possibly giving you the ability to apply a backpack to the armor piece and have extra carry space.  Or maybe some attachment that gives you extra health versus armor.  The sky is the limit, but it would bring back some vanilla resource gathering/crafting mechanics to the game.  Jet pack attachment anyone?  Oxygen tank for more underwater fun?  Modify your grapple hook to be a firing hook that brings you to places / brings people to you ala Annihilation?  Yup, good stuff here.

7.  Make giants faster.  Yep.  You got guns now

8. World destruction.  I mean why not.  We would use the SMASH regen

1343405708.0,x941s,From Leather to Iron: A MineZ Journey. ,lostpasswordagain,74,16,71,"**(Grimdale)** My journey begins. I spawned near the town of Grimdale, we quickly located the entrance and headed into the basement, seemed like an eternity. I was bleeding and badly wounded


**(Yawpton)** Full leather armor, 30 arrows, health potions and 16 cookies. We were ready. Under the cover of darkness we slipped out the east hole in the Grimdale wall and followed the river north to Yawpton. The town was overrun by looters and bandits. Lawless, is the only way to describe this small town just south of the Z-Line. With our swords at the ready we entered the west gate and quickly ducked into the building to the south to avoid detection. My mate Snook entered the building sword drawn, in case we were to fall under attack. Theres a zombie just inside the door, the loud groan alerts Snook to the present danger, he swings around and deals a deathly blow with his stone sword. The Zombie explodes in a shower of loot. We spend another 30mins in Yawpton scavenging for loot and defending off bandit attacks


**(The Z-Line)** At this point we have a accumulated the necessary gear to make bandits think twice about attacking us. Wearing Full Chain Mail


**(The Murder of Yawpton)** Low on food Snook


**(The Town Rallies)** The lawlessness of Yawpton had gone on for to long. It was time to put and end to this and avenge the death of bliss. Our heads cleared and we knew what needed to be done. Snook sent a message calling out DeathMouse. Snook: ""DeathMouse you have made a grave error by killing Bliss""  I followed this up with a message offering a reward of armor and weapons for the death of DeathMouse. The town erupted into a furry messages were popping up accepting the challenge. In less than a minute Konos had killed DeathMouse and come to the Fountian to claim his reward. We were 3 again. The town was in a bit of shock within a matter of 10 minutes we had made an example of would happen if you murdered while we were there. Comments started popping up ""This is what we need! Law and Order!"" ""Who's in charge?"" ""Where can I sign up to guard the town"". Without hesitation we decided to take command of the people. They were looking for a leader and we were going to accept the challenge of governing a once lawless town. We sent a message out saying that there are 2 rules no unjust killing and to guard and defend your fellow man from the zombie and bandit scum that wanted our land. 


**(The Army Rises)**  A few hours had passed since our band of three had assumed leadership of Yawpton. It was going better than expected newcomers were flooding into the town at an unprecedented rate. Rumor had spread that Yawpton was safe and that our men would protect you. The three of us made up an informal ruling council. We appointed two sheriffs with two deputies each to enforce the no killing rule. We placed sentries at each gate and assigned small 3 man patrols to scour the woods for possible bandits and to keep the zombies north of the Z-line. In total the count was 30 citizens. 10 in full chain with iron swords who were the unofficial army. We were amazingly well coordinated and organized. Snook commanded his own personal 3 man squad who were armed to the teeth and amazing PVPer's. Koss also had his own 4 man squad with 2 archers a healer and a full armored swords man. Snook headed north with his team to acquire more supplies and Koss headed south to recruit more men for our ranks.


**(The Challenger)** As more people migrated into the town there was confusion about how the law worked. I will admit we were all on a bit of a power trip. Arming people to the teeth providing them with food and having them give you their allegiance will go to one's head rather quickly. A small group of lightly armed individuals showed up about 3 hours into our small fiefdoms existence. The guards greeted them with the usual pleasantry 2 cookies and an apple for each travler and a verbal recognition to the law no murder. This did not sit well with this band of travelers. I noticed the hostile tone of the comments from their ""leader"" I summoned my two sheriffs and made our way to the gate. He demanded to know why I thought I was in charge and that he would kill whoever he saw. He demanded a fight. So we gave him a fight that the town would remember. We squared up in the town center Stone vs Iron. I drew my sword and moved to attack. A miss and he lands a blow. I strike


**(The Migration)** I wish I could tell you this adventure had a happy ending. However as with most kingdoms it falls. Yawpton was to small to support our vast population. Food and moral had fallen and our population had grown. We issued an edict that we would move to take Romero via Bell Farm. The journey was long and tough we lost many good men along the way to Zombies and the occasional lucky arrow from a bandit. The presence of 30 men marching down a road in full chain mail and iron swords with their leaders in full iron is daunting to say the least. Road cleared and the small forts along the way quickly abandon as we were seen approaching from the distance. Arriving in Portsmouth we were ambushed by a large group of bandits although not well organised they dealt a sizable blow to our group. Scattered and injured we regroup on the road to make for Romero. Half way there our 20 remaning men fought wave after wave of zombie hoards. Of our original 30 only 15 made it to Romeo. I was not one of them. I fell to a friendly blow from one of my men


**TL;DR: A journey of 2 good men who raised an army and brought law and order to Yawpton on Server 2. They then journeyed across the server with a team of 30 to take and live in Romero.**

So 1 year ago I hadn't spoke to Highlife in a good year or so. The last time I saw him I was building a scavenger event for his server marked with these stone markers for people to find on his alpha server. This was back when there were no mobs in Minecraft multiplayer - you just mined and built stuff all day lol. [FUN FACT: You can see one of these stone markers made from obsidian right as you enter the Frostbain Catacombs. Now you know.] Long story short we split ways for a bit and I got an invite to come check out this new thing. I offered to help out building so I set my eyes on a little town called Portsmouth and built that little shop in front of the mansion - yep Kensai's first building.

Here we are 1 year later and my how things have changed. You guys have given us such tremendous support (and grief &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232; ) over the last year and I wanted to say thank you from the bottom of my heart. Whether you just started playing yesterday or from day 1 we appreciate you joining us and above all I hope you have had many fun adventures in your time here.

We have now expanded into a network of games and will continue to strive to make this the continued #1 multiplayer gaming network in Minecraft. We have such an amazing team here at Shotbow and every member is an essential turning cog in the machine. I think we've done an outstanding job of sticking to our original plan of producing games that we want to play

That said - what is the future of Shotbow? Well I can't tell you much I'm afraid I can only assure you that we have 2 major games in development on an epic scale. We are always feeling out for new partnerships and we will work to continue to treat you guys better than any other gaming network. I've never seen another network where you guys have such a direct line right to the creators and that's something I pride ourself in. I don't feel like at any point you guys felt like you couldn't get your message seen by us. Additionally I believe we did a really good job of transparency by letting you guys know exactly what changed in every game

That all said I promised you guys some new stuff for MineZ and I will unfortunately be out of town premiering one of my movies at a theater so I will not be around this weekend to celebrate with you - I'm terribly sorry. I am leaving the build team up to uncovering all the announced areas (minus the mechanical towns - I'll have to do that when I get back sorry) this weekend in celebration of the 1 year anniversary. I'm sure they'll have some fun stuff for you guys to do and above all I hope you continue to enjoy our existing games as we work hard to develop these 2 new epic sized gamemodes.

Thank you for all your support to everyone who told a friend about us, was an early kickstarter, bought premium or even bought us a couple drinks or if you ever played our games and had some good clean fun. Without you - we would be nothing.

People talk about zombies needing buffing to counter their influence

At it's core, hordes of zombies, and hostile players- but there's another side to the post-apocalypse that isn't usually considered in stories of that ilk.

In the classic post-apocalyptic story, for supplies, for company. They fight alongside one another for the sake of their next meal or for something more elegant like a flag or a name. They team. Groups form. The more brutish groups prey on travelers and individuals to bolster the resources of their group, but all engage in turf wars with other groups who fight for the limited resources that exist in the shattered land. There are leaders, and betrayals, and murderers, and heroes- but there is no such thing as no teams. That is not in the nature of humanity.

To be short

EDIT: I personally am involved with no clans and have only witnessed a few battles by individual members. However, to the effect that we would be considered a Clan whether we like it or not. I like to avoid drama where I can, and ticking off the rogue elements of faction-based warfare is not something I'd like to do, but I have no doubt that one of my group's Quests for the North will inevitably end with a face-off against a much better prepared force. Those players will expect us to have a name. So I will fight under the flag of Bastion, my friends alongside me- for this is our survival, our family, and our blade and bow to stem the tide of Death in the land of MineZ.

Players have expressed concern with us running a 1.3 dev build. Here is my justification:

- We can roll back VERY easily

   - No build perms means no risk of losing player progress on builds if we roll back

   - We will not be introducing new items until a release candidate build

   - All progress is saved to the database and restored from there so players will not roll back if we roll back, nothing else about your state will have changed.

1360956086.0,18lg3a,2/15/2012 State of the ShotBow - Settlements and the new map...,HighlifeTTU,68,16,206,"Hello MineZers

I want to take a minute to give you an update on settlements and on the new map.  

**Settlements Update**

I know a lot of you have been anxiously waiting for settlements.  The plugin itself is about 80% complete

As of right now, and then log in to another server.  We have protection to prevent people from spawning inside of another settlement (it teleports you outside to a random spot), but it still doesn't feel right to me.  There is no scouting, no traveling.  It feels cheap and is weighed heavily towards the attackers.  But, with the new map I believe we've found the solution.  Read on...

**The New Map**

We are planning on releasing a brand new MineZ map this summer.  However

1. A single world.  Rather than have 12 instances of the same map, the goal is to support 2000 players per MineZ instance at any given time.  There are a lot of technical hurdles with this, but with the knowledge we've gained from the lobby system we feel there isn't much of a leap for us to accomplish this.
2. No more dupe exploits.  With no server hopping, since it exists to prevent such exploits.
3. Expanded world options.  Since we have a single instance of the world, and more.  The issue now is that anything we place in the map duplicates across all the instances, so once someone figures out an event they can log into the other servers to farm it.  Now we can have single events with single rewards and really give the community something to work towards.  Loot will also be easier for us, since you can't get to a location and server hop to keep collecting chests.
4. Isolated regions.  We removed wolves because the AI was too complex and caused lag on the servers.  However, as lazer has been getting very good at custom AI.

We are excited to evolve MineZ into a new direction.  There are a lot of thoughts about expanding the achievements system to a weapon proficiency system (killing zombies with a certain weapon increases that weapon's effectiveness)

**Bringing Settlements to Life**

With the new world, ambushes, and more.  Gathering resources is more exciting, as you now have multiple settlements wandering the map to secure the necessary resources to build and maintain their settlement buildings.

So what I'm getting at here is this.  Settlements is going to release with the new map.  It doesn't make sense for us to code settlements for the current setup if it is going to change soon.  It also means settlements will be a better feature on release since the concept really makes more sense on a full map.

**Public versus Private**

The existing classic MineZ map will remain public.  It will maintain the same thrilling experience it does today and will also see new features so long as those new features make sense for the old and new instances.  

*The new map will be premium only*.  Why?  Because the infrastructure to support this is going to cost a lot of money and the experience will be far better.  MineZ sees 140, you wait.  However, with a single world supported by multiple servers, you run into a lot of balancing issues.  You want to have plenty of overhead in each server region to ensure players can move from region to region easily.  If you pour in thousands of players, it isn't feasible.  As I stated before, public servers will stay around using the classic map, which I feel is an amazing experience as it stands today.  However, as I don't want folks to get excited and be let down later on.  

The current premium system will be unchanged.  Those of you who are platinum today will maintain unlimited access so long as we are running servers.  We firmly believe in fairness to our players, but after it is complete your premium works for the new map.

**Final Thoughts**

I know this is a lot to chew on

1344957566.0,y7eyy,My 10 MineZ rules.,Green8,73,17,64,"Please keep in mind that these are probably not the best rules for survival

1. Know the game. This includes knowing the map, knowing where loot is found... The wiki is very important for stuff like this and it is surprising how much better people do when they know what is going on and how to do simple stuff.

2. When in doubt, so lots of people are in the south. More people, less food. Less food, more hunger, so that means more killing. I've found people are much nicer when they have a full hunger bar, which are most people in the north.

3. Don't kill unless your life depends on it. Combat in this game is a lose-lose situation. If you get hit you lose health. It requires swinging, but especially sprinting) attract zombies. But if you are being charged at by a person with a red name combat is necessary.

4. Be prepared. You would be surprised how much better you do at traveling when you have a bow, bandages, maybe even potions compared to your starter gear. Spawn, go to the nearest location, loot, move on.

5. Be smart with your resources. This may seem simple, easy things like that.

6. Trust no one.  Even that green named person that just healed you. Even the nice traveler that gave you a stone sword. Keep an eye on people. Expect everything.

7. Location. Try to stay away from southern towns for long periods of time. If a place is empty

8. Movement. When you are alone in a great spot and you see names coming toward you hold shift like your life depends on it. For those of you that don't know sneaking behind a wall makes your name invisible to people on the other side of that wall. Also sneak when near zombies and when jumping. And avoid mountains when traveling.

9. Teaming. Small teams of people you trust (even better if you know them) work very well. Communication over skype, letting people know your plans and that you are nearby.

10. Help others. Have eight cookies and full hunger? Sure, and you may even get something from them in return. (This tip is often why this isn't the best survival guide, but I like helping others when I have what I need.)",,False,self,t5_2ubcv,,http://www.reddit.com/r/MineZ/comments/y7eyy/my_10_minez_rules/

The first thing you need to do is whack your friend with a bandage. You left click (hit them) with the bandage to start the process. If you right click

After you hit them with the bandage, you'll heal their nausea. To put the ointments on, you have to hit them with whichever ointment you choose.

1343494897.0,xaxnp,Few Balance Tweaks Today,HighlifeTTU,60,9,73,"On next roll out I made a few tweaks. 

=====Inventory Tweaks=====

I felt that we've added enough items where inventory is getting a little crunched.  To give a slight alleviation to this

* Wheat is now stackable to 3
* Cocoa beans are now stackable to 3
* Reduced bread stack from 5 to 3.

This should give a LITTLE extra inventory space

=====Zombie Reach=====

Adjusted the zombie reach a bit higher.  I noticed last night that when crouched the zombies were unable to hit you if they came at you the wrong direction.  This should fix that little issue.  This will make zombies a bit more difficult though.  I will work on an alternative to this tonight

=====Loot Adjustments=====

* Added gunpowder as a rare chance in epic chests.  This means you can now use it with a brewing station to turn those offensive potions or healing potions into splash potions.  If this ends up being too overpowered
* Reduced the chance of iron armor slightly in the epic chest.

=====Giant Kaboom======

* Increased the damage from the Giant stomp slightly (well, and also noticed that the current strategies have the Giant stomp a less common occurrence.  I've adjusted this to offset that fact.  Remember that the damage is reduced the further you are from the stomp, so it should not be much of a change if you are far away, but is more dramatic if you are right next to the Giant.

I understand the need for challenge and to prevent easy outs for players in a game meant to be brutal

As far as I can recall, it gives the player a sense that they have lost control of the game which is never a good idea. Even in a zombie apocalypse scenario, the player should feel that they are in control of what happens.

Instead I propose that, high land is no longer a permanent solution. If one or two zombies are in chase you can hold your position and knock them back, however a horde of 10 or so zombies would be difficult to manage, and would force you to continue the escape.

1343706586.0,xfiww,This game is not difficult - some tips from a non-asshole bandit,captaincannibal,57,11,45,"EDIT - I may start streaming later tonight on a nightly basis. If anybody is interested in watching my group be MLG MineZ



Hey all. I've been playing MineZ for a week now and I'm to the point where gearing up, because I don't go around slaughtering freshly spawned players for no reason. Most of my kills occur up north when I'm getting low on supplies or I feel threatened, in which case I kill on sight whenever I can. Anyways, who cares about all that. Let's dive into some tips!

- Understand each major area. You want to go through and make sure you know what sort of things spawn there (military supplies or food), running to the nearest town only to find its full of military supplies is going to get you killed. Not to mention that certain areas are bandit havens, where we tend to camp and wait around to catch some players unaware.

- Know where the hell the rivers are. Seriously. You don't want to get up north only to realize you forgot to refill your water bottles and you have no clue where the nearest source of water is.

- Have a plan. Don't just spawn in and say ""I guess I'll try here and then here"". Thats a sure fire way to die. A better choice would be ""Well I spawned 500m from here

- Do not trust A N Y B O D Y. If somebody blocks

- Tell people to screw off. This goes along with not trusting anybody. If somebody is trying to convince you to come into a house through a door filled with cobwebs so they can throw you some food

- Be aware. I can't tell you how many times my buddies and I have been up north in Frostbain or Whitehaven and we saw some kid prancing along through the trees

- If you find a group of people and they definitely saw you, but when somebody says something like that to us I always say ""No no, let him go. I don't wanna bother him"". 

- Don't bother freshly spawned players. Seriously. They have nothing of value to you. They've probably had to respawn for the hundredth time today. Be nice and offer them some supplies maybe. There are plenty of items to go around. And if your group is low on bandages or water bottles

- Don't waste arrows even if you have arrows to waste. The scariest moment for our group is always when we do an arrow count and realize we've only got ~two stacks each. That simply is not enough. You're going to be using those things up fast

- Know which areas are dangerous. The southern towns are going to get you killed. Ignore them if you can. Areas that are highly populated are not safe at all. You will die unless you get in and get out in a timely fashion.

- Don't sit around trying to farm chests. We've made this mistake quite a few times. You need to be quick. If you need to stop at Forest for some mushrooms or Frostbain for some food, and them move along. Don't attempt to camp out there for an hour.

- BRING FRIENDS! This is the most important tip ever. Seriously! Don't be socially awkward. If you know some people who play MineZ or who play Minecraft at all, etc etc. Don't all meet up off spawn. A group of kids in leather gear won't scare people away.

- Once you're all geared

- Don't fuck with kids who have better gear than you do. This goes along with the rule up above

- Don't run around saying ""team??? team???? team??? friendly??? team???? food??? healing?? team??? team??"". When we get spammed with ""TEAM????"" we usually just kill the kid. Its annoying. We're in full iron gear

- If you're in the south and see a group of people in nice gear, though. We once saw a group of four in mixed chainmail/iron who rolled into Romero and started killing kids left and right. A few grenades took care of them.

- If you're trying to be a bandit, you're going to die. By the way, you don't need ALL the loot from kills. Take what you need and leave the rest there. We made some kid's day in Romero when we killed somebody attacking him, grabbed what we needed, and told him he could take the rest. We even stood guard while he picked up the loot. tl;dr - Don't be a dick.

- Finally, get used to it. You keep dying every five minutes? You're playing the game wrong, try again. 

If anybody has any extra tips, and respawning to finally get a good route down.

1341776067.0,w8dea,MineZ Updates - 7/8/2012,HighlifeTTU,59,7,45,"Just a quick heads up on what we've been working on.

**Backend Enhancements**

* MineZ servers now check for and roll out major updates automatically.  This means if we do an update on the main server
* Synchronized the system clocks.  This should fix some of the weird issues with any game play elements that are saved that deal with a time stamp and improve stability since the plugins won't hit as many confusing things.

**PvE Test Server is Up!**

* I just changed smp3.minez.net to be a PvE (Player versus Environment) server.  In other words, spawn a little faster, and the chance of getting disease is higher.  I wanted to at least get a slightly tweaked version to you guys prior to release so you can test it out.  Right now it shares the data with the other servers, but on release it would be its own database instance, meaning your items would only cross to other PvE servers, if we decided to roll out more of them.  I can't promise I'll be able to spend a lot of time on the PvE server prior to release, but please give your feedback on it.  I did want to show you guys I wasn't full of hot air when I said I would get one up for you guys.

**Ender Eyes?!?**

* Endereye Communication.  If you find an ender eye, he won't hear it.  Let me repeat that.  YOU MUST BOTH BE HOLDING THE ENDER EYE TO COMMUNICATE.  We aren't sure if we will give everyone one of these as a starting item, or if we are going to make it a loot item.  We'll see.  We'll be tweaking this as we get feedback.

**Euro Server Update**

* Euro server isn't going to be up today.  I am still working on finding a good host.  I need a host that has the type of hardware and reputation that my US host has.  I don't want to rush this

**Sleep Achievement Unlocked**

* I got my first full night of sleep in a while.  Damn it feels good.

Pro-tips:

1) When you eat food, conserve food.

2) Don't engage in PvP except for self defense until you've grinded to iron at the spire. It just isn't worth it. Risk &gt; Reward - If you don't have full iron

3) Don't trust people. Douchebags will kill you just for teh lulz. If someone is screaming in chat to heal people and is in iron/chain

4) If you're gonna group up

5) Don't feed the noobs. This may seem cruel

6) Grimdale is bad for noobs. Your shit will get rocked.

7) Manage your inventory space. You have 36 slots

8) Hotbar. Heres how mine looks: (in order)

Sword | Bow | Instant health II splash | Bandage | milk | Food (usually cookies) | health II pot | enderpearl | enderpearl |

9) ALWAYS have milk/bandages. You can have full iron and get bit once and die from bleeding if you have no bandage.

10) If you become a bandit

11) It is better to fight off 1 or 2 or maybe 3 zombies if you are chasing them then to run and attract an entire hoard.

12) COOKIES ARE KING! They stack in 8 !

1340299918.0,ve2ln,Want to speed up the world build? Got a good idea for a building?  You can help! (Details Inside),HighlifeTTU,51,6,172,"We are hand building the world since a lot of care has to be taken in distance between locations, so at this point we are building new themed buildings for most of the new towns.

But are you a good builder?  Want to see your hard work in the server?  Make a creation and submit it to us.  If we like what we see

**How to do this**

Step 1:  Determine what you want to create.  Buildings in the server follow certain loot conventions.  They are as follow:

1. Standard house: Filled with common loot

2. Tool Drops: Think barns

3. Basic Military Drops: These are military buildings inside of a city.  Think a small watch tower, since they would be a traditional place for town watch to be stationed.  Noting huge or fancy.  The alternative to this is a blacksmith or archery location, since those would naturally have basic weapons as well.

4. Shops:  Shops hold the better food items and one is located in each town.  Right now we could use a couple desert themed shops and some winter themed shops.

Step 2: Start building.  Keep the buildings of a reasonable size.  Most of the town buildings sit on a 5-20 block piece of land.  

Step 3: Use worldedit to copy the schematic.  Use MCEDIT as the save type.  Position yourself in front of the building as close and centered as you can to the area you are copying.  We use a naming convention.  That is:

* NAME OF BUILDING_DIRECTION

For example

Step 4: Submit to /r/minez and recieve mad karma!  Please submit a screenshot of the building's exterior and interior

Look forward to seeing what the community comes up with!

For MineZ, so that players can try multiple times in a day, but can't just zerg rush.  

It is important not to allow instant respawn, but I don't want players dieing near the coast and then immediately rushing back towards their attacker.  It is a disservice to the player who is being careful, and rewards sloppy play.

That being said, the challenge is the learning curve.  While I desperately want to have a death ban to encourage players to be more mindful of their actions, I don't necessarily want players to feel that the game is too unforgiving.  I'm all about a learning curve, it makes games more fun.  

The current system is as follows:

* Players who die are banned temporarily for 1-hour.  This is a global ban across all of the MineZ servers.
* New players (first time we create player data) are given five ""instant respawn"" lives.  This means for your first go of the plugin

Issues:

Food is not exactly scarce, all three locations are heavily infested with zombies and hard to reach without a group. Considering that food should be the least of your issues it could be a good idea to spread smaller locations around the map that do not provide a lot of food, but keep you from starving.

Health potions are only avaiable in the two churches in the south at the start. For any raid to the north you need a lot of them, very dangerous; newly spawned players will attack you and probably wear you down sooner or later. I'd suggest adding a church in the western village in the snow biome.

Zombies are almost impossible to fight without heavy losses if you have an european ping. Fuck being european for that matter. Making them easier would, but am a bit frustrated that I have to lose 4 hearts to each zombie because I can't keep him from attacking me.

Cacti and Cakes are useless due to their inability of being placed.

Zombies should roam more to give way peacefully to a patiently waiting wanderer

Arrows are unevenly distributed; In the beginning

Random fires look shitty and ruin the immersion. Lazer said they were intentional

Zombies glitch under stairs and sometimes on snow

The spire is the most useless piece of ... stone ever invented. Also, similar location.

I've played vanilla minecraft for a while

So when I learned about MineZ from a friend of mine, and I like survival games. So I wasn't too sure how this was going to be since it just seemed like a minecraft with people and more rules.

So I decided to do this right and downloaded the texture pack that turns the eye of ender into a walkie talkie and such. Logged in and went into the lobby. Decided on a server and away I went.

I read the rules figured out what I needed to do and what I couldn't do and decided to jump right in.

At first the confusion was there as I was bobbing in the water. I found land and decided to do a little exploration. I quickly found the road and decided to head east. Not but 1 minute later I come across a place called Geuten. I had turned off the music long ago to add more atmosphere to this game. I see a zombie off in the distance and I debate on whether sneaking or out right killing the zombie would be better. I decide to sneak around to a building and explore that. So far nothing too different from vanilla minecraft save for a texture pack. The building has no chest so I head to this building with a spire and fire at the roof. I enter the door and am greeted by a zombie. I kill him and realize my heart is beating a little. I got startled a bit. So I climb up the top and find a chest with a stone sword inside. I think

Just below me I can hear the sounds of fighting and I see a person fighting off 3 zombies. *Do I go down and help? Should I stay out of this? Should I leave the town?* He retreats into a small house as what I thought were two zombies with armor were actually zombie players attacking him. He dies shortly and I see 5 zombies down below with two of them being player zombies and 3 regular zombies. *What was I suppose to do? If I went down there I probably would die too. Oh my god

I eventually make it down the tower as the zombies were distracted by something in the woods. I make my way over to the church and pick up some potions. I continue to raid the town for resources and find myself with water, lime dye and red dye, plenty of food, fully repaired armor, fully repaired wood sword, and a friend. I shared my potions with him and gave him some bandages. I thought, ""*Well I play a cleric or healer in most games, I head south.

A zombie comes running up and I begin to start defending myself

**I die**.

I'm not sure how it happened, I had to start over. Everything gone, and I didn't mind too much. The game was interesting. Yes, I wasn't happy that I lost all that loot, but it happens.

This time I find myself in a autumn like place

""Hi.""

""Hello

""Friendly?"" He begins to run past me.

""Yeah, completely disarmed. Ok, surely this person is good and kind. I follow him into the city and he begins looting on one side of the city and I go into a place with a pole dancing area on the top floor. I find so much medical gear, but not much in the way of food. Plenty of fresh water and plenty of bandages. Eventually another person ends up in Grimdale, but he's hurt. So I go up to him and start healing him. Then people start asking outside of the church asking if someone is healing. I tell them I'm a doctor and I can heal them if they go to the second floor of the hotel. People start lining up and I just start healing them. More people start showing up in Grimdale, and I keep sharing armor and weapons. They share food. There are now seven of us in Grimdale, and we decide to protect Grimdale. I become the resident doctor

""INTRUDER!""

I watch from the church as men start running to one side of Grimdale

""Friendly?"" There's no reply as the person is shortly murdered. I didn't think much of it. Maybe he attacked our guard. What should I care. I need to keep our milk and bandages maintained. My inventory is full of milk, potions, and three shears. More *intruders* keep showing up at Grimdale, and I decide to wander around to help the guards.

Three of the guards *found* a button on one of the *intruders* and decided to explore the sewers. They asked if I wanted to come

**I got hit**.

I turn to see a character hitting me. Some player attacking me

**I died**.

I respawn and tell my team that I am returning to Grimsdale

""Friendly

""Yeah

""I'm heading to Grimsdale. There's some good guys there waiting. They'll set you up with some good gear and food if you like

""Cool

**I got hit**.

**I die**.

I respawn near Grimsdale this time. I make my way to the town and ask if my friends are there. It's silent. No one is there. I'm alone. They had all left and all that remained were the zombies. I loot what I can carry for a long walk and am killed by the person I just got through healing on my way out of Grimsdale.

Now I don't team up with anyone that I don't know

Prologue 2: The next day, I finally reached Grimdale and met up with my friend Nuclear in the Grimdale Cemetery. We decided to call Brody to join us, but he already logged off. I had all the equipment I needed for healing someone and so did my friend Nuclear. We saw someone across the iron fence of the cemetery who got hit by zombies. Nuclear tried to heal stranger across the fence, but was hit by him. I hit the stranger behind the fence. He apologized and said it was an accident. We believed him, finished healing him, and the stranger behind the fence came into the town and found us. He joined our group. We called him ""Ry"" for short. We headed into the church and we decided to heal people for free, just like I did yesterday. We even taught Ry how to heal people. People started piling in and we formed a group. It was a bad idea to let so many people in the church. Sometimes, but everyone in the group would kill them in a matter of seconds. Since bandits/hostile people would come in occasionally to kill someone, killing random survivors. I decided to tell Ry to stop hurting people and let strangers in to the church to be healed. After that, even though we already killed a few people. The group disbanded when the server was rebooted and closed for the whole night. The next day

Today's Story: My friend and I were pissed from how we were killed yesterday and all the loot we lost. I decided to give myself another chance and headed to Grimdale. I headed to the second floor of the inn and saw someone next to a pile of random stuff. I thought he was a bandit because of the loot on the ground and killed him. I collect his stuff, my inventory was full, and there was a lot of people outside who would kill me if they saw what I was doing. Survivors were coming into the Inn and I decided to heal them instead of killing them. After healing some people, I went to the church and offered free healing. After a while, I healed some people and formed a group. I helped out other players and gave them some shears. I taught someone how to heal other players. Everyone started to heal each other instead of killing each other. Everyone was peaceful and formed some sort of ""truce"". No one in town was a bandit. One player even started to tell everyone if there was a bandit in town, and when there was a bandit in town, we murdered him. I told Ry that I was helping people out in Grimdale, I was killed. I decided to go to Grimdale as soon as possible and looked around

I logged into the pubs to see if this alleviated the burden they were experiencing last night

It didn't make sense, why the randomness? Why is it ok immediately after reboot? Why can't I just go back to sleep before work? I began to investigate further, if it wasn't my plugin changes then what else has changed?

Then it hit me: The database! We have the database on a box sporting a RAID 10 array and some sexy bandwidth,000 deaths since July 9th. 500,000 deaths being written from the 10 servers while the website is trying to read and present them to the users, that's got to be locking the database for small periods of time whenever a read occurs... leading to lag spikes when we try to write in a synchronous thread... leading to random lag spikes when there are deaths ranging from .05 seconds to 10 seconds. I have removed all death records older than 24 hours, leaving us with a healthy 100,000. We will look further into this, but there should be a noticeable increase in performance.

**tl;dr** 500, 5 hours of sleep, 1 me. Wiped all records older than 24 hours from the deaths table as I am pretty sure the website stats + the servers were fighting each other for control... will work on it more tonight.

**A point of clarification:** I will not spend my time restoring/TPing players out of spawn who got put there due to the db issues. This is beta and I need to spend this time making sure this kind of stuff doesn't happen after release. If that makes you mad enough to not want to play I am sorry.

Welcome brothers.  I am Lord Commander Navarr.  It has come to my attention that the realm has incurred the wrath of the undead scourge.  As such, is to protect the realm and to provide assistance to those in need.



We will hold two corps

* The Rangers

&gt; These brothers of the night's watch shall be armed.  It is their job to protect the realm from the invading scourge

* The Maesters

&gt; These brothers of the night's watch will be provided with medical supplies.  It is their job to heal and provide advise and wisdom.  They will be trained in the arts of healing

So join me

**Additional Notes:**

* A note to those who do not know the references - the night's watch takes no position regarding the politics of the realm.
* Deserting the watch will be met with a sentence of death (KoS).  If you have good reason to leave, the council will probably allow your leave without incurring a desertion status.

Playing with friends can sometimes be a pain. Getting in the same server and same team can be annoying. My idea is a shotbow friends list. Upon joining the game you are sent a message like (This could also be seen with /friends on any server):

**Welcome to Shotbow!**

Friends Online:

lazertester | EUSBGames_02 | Xp: xxxxxxx

HighlifeTTU | EUSMASH_06 | Xp: xxxxxxx

This simple piece of information would help a lot. You know if they are playing a game

This would be very helpful but I think it would be great if they could take it further.

Ok so you now know what server they are on but maybe you are in a server already and don't want to go to the hub. If you use the command /friends join [FRIENDNAME] it would teleport you to correct server and if it was Wasted or Annihilation join their team or GhostCraft and Smash teleport you to their arena. This would also send a message to the friend saying:

[PLAYERNAME] has joined you! 

The way you would add friends would be a simple:

**/friends add [PLAYERNAME]**

EDIT: Other player has to type **/friends accept** to confirm the friend request.

and remove friends with:

**/friends remove [PLAYERNAME]**

Thanks for considering my idea. Feedback is welcome!

EDIT: After reading comments I believe it would be a good idea to limit the amount of friends non premium users can have to about 5 and premiums to 30. Also I think it would be good to offer extra slots for around 5,False,self,t5_2ubcv,1374077744.0,, gold,t3_1ihp2q

1341522433.0,w3frr,7/5/2012 - Update on MineZ Status / Map Update,HighlifeTTU,53,11,63,"**Map Update**

I know I said the last map update was the final update

* More western land.  This should give some cushion between the world border and Grimdale.  This also means I can add a few more spawn points

* The dangerous north.  Someone last night said volcano.  I thought about volcanos.  Now there is a volcano.  The increase to the north added a new style of land, and much more.  The terrain is INCREDIBLY hard to transverse.  It is jagged, and you will need a lot of food due to the jumping.  This area will likely hold some of the more ""end game"" locations... and I wouldn't be surprised if we see a more dangerous type of zombie there soon.

The volcano area was built with world painter

This is without a doubt the final map update before release.  We are pretty confident we will hit the mid-July release date, and adding in little features here and there.  This should handle 150 players.  The server performance is showing we can probably get this up to 200 or more, but if we keep adding to the map we have to push back release.  So for now we are sticking to 150 players and this map size.

**What is coming?**

Lazer and I have been hard at work on bug squashing.  Him more than me.  We think we've nailed most of the major bugs now

1. Fully fleshed out achievement system.  Also,000 zombies total and 200 in a single life, we might give you a stone sword when you spawn versus a wooden sword.  There will be a number of these that give little perks to you as you start your next life, and give you something to work towards as you are playing.  

2. Integration of a number of elements on the website.  This includes a character page that details all of your stats

3. Backend work.  We are currently moving all the whitelist handling and what not to the database

4. Open up two more test servers (total of four).  We would like to have four running smoothly and begin to see database performance before we start preparing for the public release.  Coinciding with this we will start having scheduled stress tests for players to hop on and join for a limited time without buying pre-release access.

5. European test server.  Yeah

6. PvE server.  There will likely only be one of these, meaning you WILL need teamwork to succeed.  This server will likely not be public on release, but will be available to those of you who have purchased early access.  If this variation becomes popular, we may expand it and have a public offering.

7. ???? Yeah, mining resources, and being able to work as a team to try to have a little safe haven in the world.  Of course, anything that we put in that allows you to be ""safe"" will take team work, lots of coordination, and require work to maintain.  ;)

**Final Thoughts**

**Tl;dr** Have separate inventories for PvE and PvP servers.

*Edit:* Just to clarify. I'm aware that PvE has a tougher AI in general as compared to PvP, but after some easily obtainable great loot from low populated PvE servers, it becomes incredibly easy. You can easily expect to roll into a town and pilfer a few health potions from the church and raid the cookies in the cookie jar because nobody else is there to do it. So part of the ease in PvE is the population. I'm also aware that they're going to release wolf packs soon which I think will be great addition. Having tougher wolf packs + tougher zombies will make PvE hopefully less desirable for a server to collect loot from and then roll into more populated PvP servers and ""pwn noobs"".",,False,self,t5_2ubcv,,http://www.reddit.com/r/MineZ/comments/ydovx/suggestion_separate_inventories_for_pve_and_pvp/

turned into this:

http://i.imgur.com/Dowzrky.png

this is a solution to the imaginary complaining about minez not having guns

how does it work you ask?

here are the main concepts of this gamemode

**waves**

zombie survival is separated in 6 waves (this can be shortened if highlife doesnt want long games.) the game starts with wave 0, players can purchase items from store crates. the players win the game if they survive throughout all 6 waves, and the highest contributors get more xp. the zombies win if they kill all the players, and the zombies with the most kills get more xp.

**zombies**

there are multiple zombie types in this gamemode, and they start out as normal zombies. when a zombie kills a player, a zombie controlled by the killed player spawns where he died. here are the multiple zombie types:

* normal zombie: same damage as minez zombie. has constant mining fatigue and speed  but cannot sprint. unlocked at wave 1

* wraith: has enough damage to take an unarmored player to 3 hearts with one hit

* fast zombie: half the damage and health of a normal zombie. has constant speed 2 and can sprint. cannot instant-break cade blocks. unlocked at wave 3

* poison slinger: has half the health of a normal zombie but fists do no damage to cades or players. instead of traditional hitting

* knight: does the same damage as a minez zombie. has decreased mining fatigue

**[cading](http://i.imgur.com/MiWfPqf.png)**

in order to survive the zombie apocalypse, or else the zombies are just going to hit it for 30 seconds then it'll break. after a zombie has damaged a block used for cading, it no longer instant breaks nor drops a block for non-zombies.

**[loadout](http://i.imgur.com/kdTlmUl.png)**

all players start with $100 and have access to the loadout store until the zombies spawn. in the loadout store players can purchase guns and melee weapons and other miscellaneous items to suit their playstyle. debuffs may be activated in exchange for money and buffs may be purchased with money. both debuffs and buffs are constantly applied if bought. players will have to confirm their purchase before leaving the loadout store or reset their inventory if they feel that theyve made a mistake with their loadout choice. the only guns available in the loadout store are the basic sort of guns(generic sniper, etc) and better guns can be purchased later. if players run out of ammo in the middle of defending their base they can...

**[the store crate](http://i.imgur.com/R72XLq0.png) &amp; [the ammo crate](http://i.imgur.com/T1lzI1F.png)**

the store crate allows players to purchase better weapons, 20% of the money spent is given to the owner of the store crate. store crates cannot be bolted and always breaks after 5 hits from a zombie. the store crate can be moved in the same manner as a cade block but shares the property with them in that the store crate can no longer be moved after being damaged by a zombie.

ammo crates give you free ammo for all your weapons once every wave

**[telewatch](http://i.imgur.com/iC0P52b.png) and [telepads](http://i.imgur.com/Bt3sTAB.png)**

the gmod zombie survival gamemode has a feature that allows you to phase through reinforced props, after 10 seconds of standing still, teleports you to a teleporter pad if it's 10 blocks away.
the telewatch can only be used once every wave.

**reinforcement**

in order to strengthen and repair cade blocks, but it has 2x the health of the prop. zombies ""instant-break"" bolted cade blocks but it does not actually break. if a prop has 200 health, they have to ""instant-break"" it 200 times for it to break.

here's a diagram to explain

http://i.imgur.com/5LAqMfW.png

**bosses**

at the beginning of every wave(excluding wave 0 and wave 1) a random zombie is picked to become a boss

list of bosses:

* **envy**: a witch that poisons and weakens people whenever she punches them. when killed

* **gluttony**: a slow zombie pigman that has the ability to vomit poison at players

* **sloth**: a copy of gluttony that vomits blood at players causing them to become slow and have mining fatigue. fist attacks have the same effect. killing players turns them into instant-gib copies of sloth.

* **greed**: a villager that, you die. if you have no money and you are hit by greed, it decreases the money of a nearby player. if no survivors have money, greed instantly explodes.

* **pride**: a zombie with highlife's head, lightning strikes where the person dies and damages nearby players. 

* **lust**: a creeper that constantly emits hearts and does extra damage to barricades. if it hits another zombie

* **wrath**: a rare boss that is a wither skeleton. its attacks apply the wither effect and sets players on fire. also has the ability to emit a ghast scream that blinds players for 5 seconds. 

**TL;DR**: the gmod zombie survival gamemode ported to minecraft. pretty much the same except for a few changes here and there.

**NOTE:** sorry for the convoluted post. i may edit this later. ask questions if you're confused.

**ADDENDUM**:

**possible premium upgrades &amp; xp shop bonuses**

of course

**premium upgrades**

* reserved slot

* immunity to getting randomly picked as a zombie. can be turned off.

* increased starting money???

* special cosmetic effects such as exploding in purple fireworks when you die

* access to premium maps

* achievements

* ability to save starter loadouts? (dont know if this would be too taxing on the server)

**possible purchaseable xp upgrades**

* limited time immunity from getting randomly picked as a zombie. can be turned off.

* access to individual premium maps

I used to never make it passed Portsmouth or Romero (when I got lucky) and I still sometimes don't.  But here's the thing: all I needed to do was wise up!  Get smart.  Here's my suggestions for you of weary heart:

1. GET REI'S MINIMAP. Then get all of the coordinates for landmarks.  Not only is this one of the few mods that are actually legal for MineZ
2. Once you get a feel for where things are with the coordinates on the minimap, etc. It's really just what works for you.
3. Get teammates you can trust.  Though sometimes teammates can be chumps
4. Quit hanging around the southern cities! These cities include Portsmouth, etc.  Noob bandits will randomly kill you there, and you really only need some food and/or healing potions before you move on.
5. Avoid zombies more often. Because normal zombies in minecraft are easy targets, and dodge em. It's the safest route.
6. Lastly

Just remember

- Added option for lootchests to still spawn if a player is around. We will be setting a lot of low level chests to use this to make them ""campable"" for food etc.

- Added Achievements system! I added an achievement system that is so simple, and custom reasons.

- Vastly improved Zombie ai efficiency! It wasn't bad before

- Awesomeized zombie roaming. You have probably noticed that zombies actually roam now. I figured out a few missing pieces and I am happy with the results

- Bleeding/bandages. It sounds like I still have a few things to work out here

- Login cooldown. Added a cooldown between logging out and logging into another server to prevent server hopping to avoid antilogger death.

- Antilogger synchronization. I made it so if you die on one server then log in on the other the antilogger will kill you and make you respawn.

- Database driven whitelist. This will fix those ""I can get on smp

- Admins can ride flying wolves. I am neither confirming nor denying this is the case...

- Additional stats capturing and persistent stats that do not wipe on death.

- (GraphicH and Rafiki) Harvestable mushrooms, and disappearing levers/buttons! Rafiki and graphic made a plugin that makes this all possible!

- Other stuff: I am sure I am forgetting a few things... oh well.

Some upcoming changes:

- Chat garblization based on range: going to up the max range

- Database driven Badge/title/color: Right now we are using permissionsEx to set the player's prefix and suffix for the badges and name coloring. I will move this over for the same reason as the whitelist

- Stop hard crashes: We are being plagued with random crashes that look to be a concurrency issue. I have learned that bukkit is not exactly thread safe, needs fixed.

Here's what I mean...

People are bandits *mainly* for one of three reasons:

* They think that the best way to survive and ultimately thrive is to kill before being killed, they can kill ONE person and get health pots, armor, weapons, and other supplies all at once.

* They love PvP

* Because they want to be a dick and think it's fun to piss off other people or be a troll.

But I have an alternative that can give you the three things listed above and more! THESE are some of the many reasons that bandit hunting is

* You still get the PvP thrill

* Think about it: you're already on bandits' KoS list. You don't have to piss them off to do that. They'll kill you anyway. You don't have to make any unnecessary enemies when you kill. If anything

* You can still get good gear and supplies from your kills. In order to be a successful bandit

* Yeah

* BONUS: You can feel better knowing you didn't accidentally ruin a new player's experience and drive them from playing MineZ ever again. You know you kept innocent players from dying by bandits. Therefore you have a clear conscience.


So I hope you see my case. I'm sad that there's hardly any bandit hunters in the MineZ world. The ones I see/meet are few and far between. It'd be nice to get together a team if anyone is interested...

I think I've found a spell to contain them but if they were ever released from their undead form it would be disasterous! What say you Nights Watch - are you up for the fight of your lives?

EDIT (Out of character): This would be an event for all players (or as many as I can hold on 1 server which I believe the max was around 250 people on 1 private server for 1hr). There is no special treatment for Night's Watch - as a player you would be free to kill Night's Watch or the elemental lords. However if Night's Watch is successful in holding off the horde of undead plus the players who choose to be bandits and attack them everyone in the game on all servers will be rewarded. Likewise if Night's Watch fails it will actually affect the game making it harder in certain areas for EVERYONE. So which will you choose - help the Night's Watch slay the undead or will you choose to be a bandit and assassinate the lords even if it will knowingly make the game harder on yourself. This is MineZ - I won't make the choice for you. I just want to give you guys the opportunity to make a difference and actually see it on the map!

* With the panel of Moderators controlling the whitelist

* Players should have the ability to choose the town they will spawn in first.  While the primary concern about that would be everyone spawning in a good town

* Because Death is very important when roleplaying, the difference in RP would of course be that a person's life is their only one.  In an RP world, I would expect to be able to take on a Zombie one at a time and come out a little bruised but alive.  In MineZ this would probably mean death (at least based on what I experienced last night on beta.*)

Combining these ideas together would make a very interesting roleplaying experience.  It would be fascinating to see how people come together to create stand-in governments and police forces

About 18 months ago

I contacted him asking for a project to create for the server

One night in April or May

I don't remember all of the development process, and my wife almost slapped me silly due to the amount of time I was spending playing stupid video games :) I don't blame her, really, but she took really good care of me as she saw me get swept up in a newfound passion.

Once we had something solid enough for an alpha, with many mornings where I would wake up and be surprised at what I had developed the night before.

Our launch was rocky, inventory losses, nocheat issues, and lots and lots of unoptimized code it was truly an alpha. Slowly but surely, you all helped us shape MineZ into what it is today. The pace of change has slowed from those initial months, mainly because the audience has grown and every change I make impacts 50-75 thousand players daily. This means I have to be more stringent on what I change and how I change it in order to lessen the negative impact on our players. When I am not as stringent as I should be, I usually hear about it in minutes via forums or reddit posts, or staff relaying a combination of the above to me. We still listen and implement community feedback

---

I won't recount all of the history between MineZ's launch and now right now (maybe for the Shotbow 1 year)

Thank you
I am especially grateful to those who made videos on this newfangled MineZ thing before we knew that youtube video game videos were a thing. I know many of you discovered MineZ through these videos of the adventures of the huge personalities that we have seen sign in to our servers over these 12 months.

As always

1370482093.0,1frfcb,[Public Event] Final Stand,Tetraporc,45,10,130,"A while ago, known as [The Fellowship of the Carrot](http://www.reddit.com/r/MineZ/comments/186b5t/the_fellowship_of_the_carrot/). Sadly

There will be two teams, would look even cooler in a siege and frankly, it could use the publicity. If you have a better suggestion, tell me where and why, and I'll consider it.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**RULES**: 

-You can bring any gear you can get your hands on

-You can't change teams in the middle of the event

-Once you're dead

-Don't team kill

-If you don't have a green or red dyed chest plate

-Keep a good attitude

-No cheating ( hacking

-Attackers

-Once the battle is over, those people are your battle-brothers!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Time for some Role playing!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When we destroyed the Golden Carrot, that evil had been defeated for good. The Carrot gone, Adminron the Great was rendered powerless. Little did we know, he was just a servant of an even more powerful and evil force, he was but one of the fingers of the hand of darkness... 

His master has finally stepped out of the shadows and revealed himself to us. His name is Highoth^TTU


Already his armies march across the land, it is our duty. Which is why I, General Porcius, send out this call to arms to all able bodies, journey to Stillwater Motte, our last standing fortress. If you cannot fight, atleast try and provide our forces with whatever supplies you have. The armies of Highoth^TTU will crash against our stone walls and steel weapons like waves. It is where we will stand, where they will DIE!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If all goes as planned, the green team will start preparing the defenses and at 8:15 PM EST, the red team will launch their assault from Yongton Abbey.

To facilitate communication, I advise you to do the same and pick another room. 

**TIPS**: Green team, and a few buttons.

Red team, as well as some buttons of your own.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Message to any clans or bandits that are thinking of going in there and killing everybody: trying to ruin other people's fun is not fun, it makes you a douche. If you are looking to kill stuff, why not participate? There should be plenty of killing and think of all the plunder you'll get...

The idea is we would re-purpose some of the MineZ servers to have guns.  Before you speak up, and maybe bring back some folks who left because they have experienced all there is to see.  So we would split the community between MineZ vanilla and MineZ guns, but I think it may be for the best.

This is honestly just an idea though.  If there is a huge amount of support behind it

Because I like bullet points

PROS:

* Guns
* Combat hacking is eliminated.  No more reach
* We can increase zombies and their reach again
* Guns

CONS:

* Splits the community.
* No swords
* You will die much quicker and much more suddenly from other players.

Thanks again to Majicou for providing honest player input in these staff decisions. I know you've played this game more than anyone and I appreciate your honest input - especially when you suggest a nerf to the towns you love. 

I'm excited to see people traveling to these long forgotten areas that were long overdue for a balance.  All in all I think people will be happy with these changes. Still a few more areas to improve and might tweak a few of these areas in the future. In particular I'd like to give Loarful Mines some love on the next update. Thanks and happy zombie hunting!

There is definately a learning curve.  I find the game challenging but doable even without any of the changes everyone seems to be suggesting.  While it takes a few minutes to find each other we have worked out a system. If there was a way to spawn as a team then bandits could do the same giving them strength in numbers taking away any advantage your team would have.  It seems to be relatively easy to get together

Now here is the hint for team with the bad review, jump or other loud or quick movements to draw attention.  Try to get in a position where zeds can only come at you from one or two directions.  I like corners and the top of stairs or a tree at my back.  Even doorways make it so they have to funnel in. 

Now everyone is going to yell at me but I think it is a BAD idea to have food on spawn.  In my opinion that is just another reason to be killed

I suggest altering one public server (or adding another server) to be a ""lulz"" server. Its up to you whether private or public, this is what this server should have:

1. Infinite durability on all armour/weapons

2. Potion bug reinstated

3. Chance of diamond armour at the fire shrine (for lulz)

4. Spawn with full leather and stone sword and a stack of cookies

5. No achievements active

6. Giant spawner just outside romero and grimdale and yawpton (oh my)

There are several reasons that I believe this would be a great addition to your set up. For one players who die 6-7 times in a row that would normally ragequit can go have fun for a bit and then return to normal play. Just as much, able to cool rages and break the sometimes monotony* for those of us with (trololol) full diamond sets who have killed everything there is to kill in-game.

 * [**This map**](http://i.imgur.com/F64gB.jpg)
 
 * **Private server**: PvE
 
 * **A team of friends.**

When you spawn in
-1000 and 1000 on the X axis. If they are not, just grab one round of chests and head west along the coast.

Once arriving in Portsmouth, breadx3, mushroom stews if you aren't too lazy.) 6-7 Instant health II's, 4-5 Water bottles, milk, 2 bandages, and some leather armor if its readily available by the time you have all your other supplies. I'm going to assume you know how to combine your damaged swords and leather armor. By the time your done in Portsmouth

Now its time to head towards the Spire. It is not that far from Portsmouth, then just follow it east. You will see a small island with a tall tower. Walk inside the Tower and proceed to jump up the gaps in the stairs until you get to the top. When you get to the top, walk over to the southern edge and sprint jump into the little gap. Camp the chests until you get an inventory similar to [This](http://i.imgur.com/EEwEr.png) Spend $10 so you can have access to the PvE server, it supports the dev's and is 
**Well worth the money.** $10 is a steal for what they offer. This way people wont hop to your server and spam grenades at you. [Its a long way down!](http://i.imgur.com/XmIqX.png) You can either jump off the side

At this point you have some options of where else to go. These are completely optional and wont help you that much.
 
 * **Ridgevale:** To make splash potions
 
 * **Camp Kharj:** Extra swords/supplies
 
 * **Stonehenge:** Same loot as Spire
 
 * **Pirate ship:** A bit of food

Now you will want to go to **Al Hasa**. (X: 1600 Z: 3000) Open the map linked at the top to see where your going. This is quite a far walk, I **highly** suggest using a PvE world for this. People in Al Hasa will kill on sight because they are assholes. (Or you could kill them first ;) ) Stock up on apples and Health potion II's, then its time to claim your diamond sword.

Giants will probably kill you the first time you fight them. Why? Because of their stomp. It was recently buffed, so don't waste them. Every time you hit the giant, he will orally give birth to 3 zombies, so watch out for that. When he jumps, move diagonally of him and run as fast as you can. They currently have 50 (Correct me if i'm wrong) hearts of damage, and double that on PvE.

Eventually he will die (hopefully not despawn D:) and a diamond sword

**Draithian's Desert Outpost**: When you thought there couldn't be anymore added to the desert Draithian builds a fantastic looking outpost with the tools from his sandbox!

&gt; MineZ is inspired by DayZ.  If you haven't played DayZ
focused on survival.  Players start with a basic set of equipment and
must manage their hunger
of zombies and players.  Towns hold basic supplies
be refilled with any water source
military installations near the northern part of the map that will
spawn much better gear.  You will die.  Everyone dies.

&gt; The world is indestructible,
and chests that you find.  These items are destroyed when you break
them
arrows
up one space.  Arrows are limited to 15 (a nod to the double stacked
clip of a 9mm).  You'll have to make hard choices on what you want to
carry on you.    Health regen is disabled.  Eating food (besides
zombie meat) restores a half heart.  There are health potions that
spawn in hospital type locations.

&gt; The current test map is 1200x1200.  It is hand painted and built.  For
tonight
it while you test the initial mechanics.  The final map will be very
large
on the way to refill hunger and thirst.  There is no PvP protection
but we do try our best to make sure you spawn away from another
player.  This is as hardcore as it gets.  Rafiki is complaining about
the difficulty right now in mumble
make it easier if you guys ultimately can't find a good way to
survive.

MineZ is still that same game we envisioned so long ago.  While there have been a ton of additions beyond the initial scope of the alpha

Now for some random facts about the start of MineZ before I ramble some more:

* Alpha started June 17th
* The first press released was [an imgur album](http://imgur.com/a/a0mV1) on June 21st,617,234 views.
* The beta of MineZ began on June 26th
* When the beta first launched
* MineZ has been written about on G4TV, and more.  
* MineZ has had approximately 2.0 million unique players play it.  To put this into perspective
* MineZ has been played by a ton of youtube personalities.  We've had the pleasure of meeting many of these guys over the last year and I even sang a karaoke duet with Guude (that was embarrassing).
* Lazertester wrote the initial iteration of the current zombie AI in a single evening.  This was his third major java project.  Interesting side note
* MineZ had its own [MineCon panel](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg-Q5Oyiyoo) last year.  It was an honor to be invited and speak

So much has happened since a year ago.  We've expanded MineZ beyond its initial feature set, and we still aren't done.  All of this success is a credit to you, the players, who came to play MineZ.  Without your support, we wouldn't be where we are today.  While I have very little time to play actual games anymore, I find just as much joy in creating games and watching you, the players, and I am excited for the future of MineZ and the Shotbow Network.

Over the next couple of weeks the staff will be releasing some great new things to MineZ as a celebration of this one year anniversary, won't be able to make it as I will be out of town at a wedding from tonight through next Wednesday.  However, when I return I plan to join the celebration, throw a few wave events, and maybe a few Q&amp;As by stream.  

Thank you to everyone who has played MineZ

In my time playing this wonderful mod, I've taken it upon myself to try to tackle them on my own. 

I've made countless attempts with more failures than not, and I hope I'll be able to give you folks some ammunition in the form of knowledge, in how to take one of these suckers down.

**Warning**: This guide is *long*, and comprehensive tactics. Read at your own risk

My preferred combat location is Al Hasa

Step One: Be well equipped. What this means for you may differ from what it means to me

* 3-4 Water bottles, however, getting to Al Hasa requires this much water/food, so it's really not for the sake of the giant battle.
* A full-durability iron sword, dishing out that extra damage, and knocking the giant back, so you can get more hits in before it tries to stomp you. You can also clear out the resulting zombies that the giant spawns with relative ease. I usually get one with 1/3 durability at Hell Tree before going to Al Hasa
* No Enderpearls/nades. I found out in my early attempts that these do *not* damage giants, ditch the nades for...)
* **Health Potions**: These, I make sure potions take their place. In the heat of battle, however, you don't want to be slowing down to take sips, so before going out to fight that giant, I take a few looting cycles around the Al Hasa, preferring to pick up **Splash Health II Potions**. These work wonders because they're not only a good way to heal yourself as you're backpedaling away from the giant, do those suckers take a toll on zed flesh. Any potions *not* throwable are **Instant Health II**. Total potion count is around 10-12 for me. (Note: Golden apples take precious time to eat
* Bandages. 3 is a good amount
* An **Enchanted Bow**. While arrows are useless against the giant itself, saving your health, and your arrows. As for arrow count, I like to have 5-6 stacks of 15.
* This may go without saying, Hell Tree is great for this.

I believe that covers the loadout. Now comes the second

This is where I am before I start the battle. I am at the entrance of Al Hasa with the equipment listed above. The giant is a ways beyond the wall. I head out towards him with the enchanted sword drawn. 
What I typically do is get the giant's attention. Get close to it. Once it sees you, start swinging at the feet. As the giant takes damage, zombies will spawn around it's stomach, and fall to it's feet, and start chasing you. 

Eventually, an enormous explosion happens around the feet, dealing many hearts of damage, depending on how close you are to the blast. Additionally, players are thrust backward up to 50 blocks. **Note**: before the giant lands, you want to back away as far as possible. *Just before* the giants' feet touch the ground, **block** with your sword. This will halve the amount of damage you take

Immediately after the blast, so use one. Next, take aim with your bow, and eliminate whatever zombies are coming your way with well placed headshots.

After they're taken care of, and it's the fact that the giant is injured. Look at your hunger/thirst meter and make adjustments as necessary.

So you're going to do it again. Make sure you have plenty (about 4 or so) potions on your hotbar. Approach, if you take some zombie damage while backpedaling, throw down a potion at your feet; this will injure the chasing zombies/giant, and heal you at the same time. Win/win. 

You'll be blasted again. The giant will get lower on health. You'll heal yourself appropriately. As this battle is happening, get some from the tower after the giant has sent you flying backward and out of it's aggressive range. Rinse/repeat.

After a good 5 minutes of doing this (this happens much faster than I'm describing it) the giant will be low on health. When you land your final blow

Once that's over, (sometimes) golden apples, and (also *sometimes*, as there are cases when the main goodies don't spawn at all) the Diamond Sword and/or Infinity Bow! Screencap that shit, yo. You worked hard for it.

That's all there really is to it. Though

* When backpedaling, with nowhere to run. Being stomped at point blank is certain death.

* Similarly

1343441644.0,xa3k2,Hunger and you: A MineZ anti-starvation tutorial,Shiirn,44,7,36,"Food is the number one resource in MineZ. I'm going to cut to the chase and give a very basic run-down of why this is and how you can maximize the potential of your food.

I'm not very good at being verbose

There are 4 different numerical values regarding food in Minecraft.

* Level: This is your haunches. This ranges from 0 to 20

* Timer: This is what heals and damages you. Every 8 seconds

Since Healing is not in MineZ, as you should not keep a completely full or empty hunger bar at any time to play optimally. The next two values are the ones that are VERY IMPORTANT:

* Saturation: This is the hidden variable everyone has trouble with, it adds Saturation on top of the regular Level it gives. Saturation is drained first, which is why you may notice that you tend to drain your bar a lot slower after eating something than after a long time of not eating. This is the most important stat of all. Note that it cannot ever exceed Level, so eating multiple food items at once is very inefficient.

* Exhaustion: This is what causes your food to go down. Every action you take adds some to this variable. When Exhaustion reaches 4.0, and then from Level if saturation is 0.


The math is fairly simple

What is the most efficient way of covering ground?

Walking. Sprinting uses food 10x faster than walking over the same distance.

Minimizing jumping. Jumping once is the same as covering 20 blocks while walking. Always use half-slabs positioned on the pathways!

Minimize combat. Attacking and taking damage take big chunks away from your hunger. But if you're going to fight

Always eat **after** you lose a haunch. The most efficient way to maximize saturation is to wait for the visible food bar to go down

Let's look at food quality next.

* Cookies: 1 Level
But because you can craft 8 of them


* Melon: 2 Level, as they literally give twice the food.


* Apple: 4 Level, of course.)


* Mushroom Stew: 8 Level


And down down down down at the bottom: 
Zombie Flesh: 4 level, just barely beating out a melon over all. There's only a 20% chance of eating flesh without getting poisoned.

Now here's the major part of the article:

What is food poisoning?

After eating a piece of zombie flesh, will deal 15 points of exhaustion. This is roughly equal to four times the 4.0 tick timer. This means that if you are poisoned, you *will* lose 3.75 hunger, no matter what you do during the duration. **No matter what you do during the duration**. Standing still just makes you feel a bit better because the food bar decreases less actively. No matter what, if you get poisoned by eating a piece of zombie flesh, you essentially ate less than a *single* cookie. This makes zombie flesh by far the least efficient source of food in this mod. It is a completely last-ditch food, that you will hopefully never need if you follow these anti-starvation tips.

Firstly, and maybe open up some good possibilities for a few secluded hunting lodges dotted about.

As has also been suggested before
This would make hunting them a challenge

Now, so that is not an issue. The main concern is fuel – the two most 'common' fuels would probably be sticks and, post 1.3, wooden swords (although this could encourage spawn-killing, so would have to be carefully considered). Coal would be much rarer, being found primarily in the mines when they are sorted out.
If sticks or coal interferes with possible plans for crafting in the future, furnaces are primarily server side, so there could be modification of what can burn and burn rates (e.g. prevent paper from burning).

If both sticks and coal are available for fuel, giving players a way to leave markings and trails for others. Or, if crafting is not easily controllable server side, they could just be non-placeable.

**What a Legendary Weapon is**

Legendary Weapons are supposed to be overpowered

- Taking on a large amount of people

- An impolite way to tell people to fuck off

- (The way it was used for) Launching people to oblivion for banditing purposes.

Allow me to elaborate on the way it was used. 

Yes, taken arrow shots from their pursuer, had been bleeding, had gotten the infection, or taken damage from his/her's own stupidity. Most of the time the person being perused could recover from the damage taken from the long fall that Simoon's Song propelled them into. The point I'm trying to get across  is that when Simoon's Song had been used during banditing the person falling to it's former effect had to either experienced more fall than usual or had taken previous damage. 

For more elaboration look at [this] (http://www.reddit.com/r/MineZ/comments/1g3o7y/more_op_legendary_weapons/) post.

**The Nerf**

We all knew it was inevitable. We all wanted it as well. But what really pisses me off is how it was done. Nerfs

Area Being Nerfed |Reason |Nerf |
:--|:--|:--|
Hell Tree |Too easy to farm iron armor |Spawner |
Death Mansion |Too easy to farm iron armor |Spawner |
Floating Island |Too easy to farm iron armor |Allowed spawned mobs access to the player |

Seriously? Have I been the only one the whole time that has seen this pattern of noncreative nerfs? And now Simoon's Song is another thing to add to the list. Now

**The Proposal**

I believe that we should have a much better way to go about nerfing things other than turning it's name into shame. I know this may not be the best idea

The Rubber Chestplate. We all know how useless it is. Swords slice through it like butter even though it gives you maximum protection against arrows. I believe that the Rubber Chestplate should take ALL Knockback down to nothing, Knockback I swords, and most importantly, Simoon's Song. This will both give you a reason to wear the Rubber Chestplate for more than one purpose. This is how I believe nerfs should go about. We have a legendary weapon that is considered OP? Fight fire with fire. Make a new or adding a new effect to legendary weapons to so they can fight among themselves. I believe this would've been a more efficient act of nerfing compared to laying shame to the name of the LEGENDARY sword Simoon's Song. 

**TL;DR:** Simoon's song deserves to be OP. ",self,t5_2ubcv,1373818959.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/MineZ/comments/1ghdt6/my_thoughts_on_the_simoons_song_nerf/

1346210411.0,z01co,Psychology of the MineZ player,ShinySnack,39,2,56,"First and foremost - I am not an experienced MineZ player. I've just recently gotten into the mod. However

Let's start at the beginning. When I started MineZ, and I will not attack unless attacked. 

From a DayZ player, works much better then expected. In DayZ, it is much easier to take someone out that has better gear then you - a few shots to the head and they're out. However, in MineZ, it is much harder to kill someone in general, and high-level gear is important. In addition to this, far-ranged combat can't kill easily and communications are simple and far-ranged. Coming from DayZ

I was generally suprised by the amount of friendlies - or people who don't attack at least - in the large population of the southern coast. At least 75% of the people I meet don't mind me - and I don't mind them. This is a large

Then there are the really friendlies. These are the people who are few and far between - they'll help you out, share loot, and generally do a lot of nice things to help other people out. Usually, I find these people attempting to get healer in large towns such as Romero. Occasionally, I find them wandering towards high-food areas such as whitehaven or ridgevale. Generally, they aren't too equppied - which suggests that they die much more then other people. Not suprising. I'd say this makes up 5% or so of the southern population.

Then you have bandits. (Fresh spawn bandits don't count for this) Not the ones that flash the friendly sign first - I'll get to that later. I'm talking about simple bandits that don't decieve other people. Now, from what I've seen, a very, VERY small percentage of the population on the southern coast. To be honest, in all my play time, (which, I guess

And finally, I'd say, 10% of the population. They flash the friendly sign, then procede to bash your face in. To be quite honest, I've found these types of people almost annoying - although my opinion might be slightly biased. I mean, it is technically a good tactic. However, I just don't see how these people sleep at night. What suprises me the most, is how many of these people there are on the southern coast. They are very

Here are some signs that I find expose some of these decieving bandits -
1. Flashing the piece sign
2. Flashing a piece sign
3. Asking to join you amd following you around. Usually done by newspawns. They do this, they stab you in the face.
4. Sprinting towards you. Yeah

In the times I've been up north, in a group, and not friendly. For example - I once visited Crowmure, and, thinking it was empty, decided to loot one of the houses. Someone started coming up the stairs. I flashed the friendly sign, said friendly, then went back down stairs.

1342502089.0,woqzx,The 50 rules of MineZ,Katamayan57,52,17,127,"Edit: Thank you all so much for the upvotes.

I'm currently constructing a set of 50 rules in MineZ. Now

* They can't be anything simple. No ""make sure you have food!""

* They can't be anything too complex/long. No ""If you're going to Al Hasa, then Whitehaven, then Frostbane, and always kill zombies with your bow.""

* They need to make sense. This means both in grammar and just in general. No ""Wen go tree under sprint refuse are propar!1""

Let's begin.

1. You're never safe in Yawpton.
2. You're NEVER safe in Yawpton. 
3. Never *fully* trust a stranger from the southern cities.
4. If you got hit by somebody
5. If you hit somebody else
6. If there's a water source in sight
7. If you have two half broken items
8. Always fight zombies on uneven terrain.
9. Be conservative with your weapons. Save the best ones for bandits.
10. Walk backwards when fighting multiple zombies.
11. Walk in circles when fighting a single zombie.
12. Don't stop swinging until both the player and the zombie are dead.
13. Inventory management is vital.
14. Headshots are important when sniping zed.
15. Only sprint if you have a deathwish.
16. Always have backup items.
17. Use the [map.](http://i.imgur.com/zatMc.jpg-) 
18. Don't pick fights with zombies that can't see you.
19. Always travel with a buddy
20. Be wary when trading.
21. Don't put bandages or enderpearls next to your bow in your hotbar.
22. If a stranger in a city steps within six blocks of you while staring at you
23. If a stranger in the wilderness steps within ten blocks of you while staring at you
24. Eat food strategically. Do not waste a loaf of bread if you're missing 1/2 on your hunger bar.
25. Zombie flesh is only useful in large quantities.
26. If you find a new item unseen to MineZ before
27. Groups of people in iron armor down in the south are almost always out to kill you.
28. Never tell strangers your coordinates.
29. Always have two healing items if traveling alone
30. If you have more than five arrows
31. Pay attention to chat.
32. Don't try to take out a lone zombie in the wilderness. There are usually 4-5 more waiting to rush you.
33. Romero is full of zombies.
34. If Romero is not full of zombies
35. When in the wilderness
36. When in doubt
37. Come prepared with a button/lever when going to Evergreen Manor. Nobody is going to let you in.
38. Don't attack other people in spawn. You will usually die.
39. The peace sign does not guarantee a thing.
40. Sound can save lives.
41. If you're in a city
42. Don't hack. You will become pregnant. And then you will die.",self,t5_2ubcv,1342582217.0,,zombie format,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/MineZ/comments/woqzx/the_50_rules_of_minez/

Im indeed sorry for using ANY hack on your servers

I want you to understand this:

I care about this project. I devote more time than I should to making sure it runs smoothly. Every encounter like this that I have with a lying little piece of @%^&amp; who I just banned makes me harder and harder towards players. Your little #@$!ing stunt that means jack diddly @%^&amp; to you is what I have to experience every #@$!ing day when I hit the ban command.

We get the rules down pat, balanced, and happy now. We are going to go work on the next big update to it while you guys enjoy it, with patches here and there as needed. Your stats and achievements from now on will be permanent and loot chests have been balanced, have fun!""(That's pretty much how transition from beta will go considering we have 12 servers up right now...maybe the EU servers as well)

Two days after the rollout we hear back ""OMG MineZ is FULL OF EXPLOITERS"" and ""Wow

I do not want that.

Instead I ask that any exploits found be reported to me

Now

- Fixed being able to hop servers to avoid death. (If you have found a way to do this still

- Fixed craftable items being able to stack higher than we intended.

- Created giants with unique behavior.

- Had a sammich.

Once again I implore you: If you find an exploit please let me know. I would rather you report it than the raging player you just used it on

**Any exploiting after release WILL get you banned

**Hacked clients do not fall under exploits

1340814360.0,vow5p,6/27/2012 - Planned Beta Changes Tonight,HighlifeTTU,38,3,28,"Last night we got a lot done.  Some highlights:

* Starting items reduced to a half broken wooden sword and half broken leather chest.  With the reduction to zombie damage
* Zombie damage reduced from 6 to 4.  This allows a few more hits before dieing.  Still plenty of death to go around.
* Moved the MineZ server to a different dedicated box.  Latency and network issues should be greatly improved until we figure out what is happening with the other dedicated.  The main box runs a 1280v2
* Added a main road between the two main coastal cities.  This has helped new players guide themselves to a starting location.  We plan to connect all the major cities with roads soon.
* Added disease.  You have a 1% chance to get infected upon being hit by a zombie.  It is in its very rough form
* Added some new cities/landmarks across the map.  I didn't get around to increasing the map size due to some host issues

**Changes Tonight / Tomorrow**

* Further performance optimization.  
* I will begin making a map available online that is static
* Zombies in armor... WHAT?! We believe we can add armor to the zombies.  For terms of bukkit, making them harder to kill.  This will help us scale the difficulty between the coast and the northern settlements.  We are still working out the coding issues with it but it seems possible.
* More roads.  We will also begin populating the roads with abandoned houses and farms
* Improve disease to not carry over on spawn.  Make it so it only drops you down to 7 full hearts versus killing you out right.
* Nocheat tweaks for the snow.  Nocheat is such a love/hate relationship for me.",self,t5_2ubcv,1340817672.0,,developerred format,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/MineZ/comments/vow5p/6272012_planned_beta_changes_tonight/

1372441756.0,1h9esz,[Announcement] ZPapz's Scavenger Hunt! (Up-Vote for visibility!),ZPapz96,65,29,56,"After weeks of preparation I will be finally hosting my very own scavenger hunt! Before we start i'd like to thank Mr_Darn and Majicou for helping me set up this hunt. Now onto the good stuff


Now these are the Rules for the hunt:

-No cheating
-No Pming me for help.
-No cheating


1) This hunt will not be as normal as the previous ones. I have implemented Binary Code. Each clue will come with a group of numbers. (0111010001011000010101) After you have found each clue in order you will have to put all the codes together (IN ORDER) to form a phrase.

Use Google: http://www.roubaixinteractive.com/PlayGround/Binary_Conversion/Binary_to_Text.asp

2) The clues will not be numbered. This is because i do not want people to randomly find clues and then they can just check that one of their list. In order to successfully complete this you will have to find each clue in order.

3) There will be a format in which you will have to submit the evidence to me:

- Each sign will be blank

- Once you believe you have completed the hunt message **Aoifetheshadows AND ZPapz96** on the Shotbow website with your proof.

- A screenshot of you finding each clue is required: http://gyazo.com/6cf89d55419c30457f5b4b391da7c347

-&gt; The screenshots will have to be exactly like this with these few things needed.

1) The person submitting the evidence will have to be in EVERY screenshot. I say this because i do not want clans to scatter 80 people across the map.

2) The screenshot must be in f5 with the link in the chat. : http://gyazo.com/5f0539d81f5b9b27c4bf00121d336e5a

3) You must type out my name in chat for every clue so i can verify that it is actually you taking the screenshot. : http://gyazo.com/e79bc1c8fee4f9f72e85967a2c6257a6


- Make sure you remember the order in which you found each clue. The Binary Code will only make sense if put together in the right order.

- Even if you submit every picture but you are missing the secret message you will not be declared the victor.

- A screenshot without these prerequisites will not be counted 


I know that this is a lot of info for you to take in but I am giving away 100$ from my own money for this. (and a legendary) I want it to be as hard as possible

The update of the signs will roll out at 3pm EST
