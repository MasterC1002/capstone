1335818508.0,t0bj5,The GD Studio is recruiting,Tranceh,100,11,36,"Ok guys so if you have watched our latest meeting show you know that we are looking for a bunch of people to help out with various (mostly online) tasks. I will try and list exactly what we are looking for together with a short description.

* **Social media promoters**

Looking for 1-2 people that will be trusted with our social media channel info (twitter and facebook mostly) who can update people about our upcoming shows, facebook promos from the sponsors, etc.

* **Webmaster**

Someone who can handle maintenance of our upcoming site and apply small changes to it when needed. We don't know what language the site will be coded in yet so I will get back to this point sometime in the future.

* **Community sites content promoters**

One person from each of the communities we cover games for (Dota2, Quakelive) who can promote, in advance our up and coming tournaments, bigger shows etc. Teamliquid, esreality, gosugamers/joindota, some BLC site which i dont know of, etc.

* **Experienced Adobe Flash coder**

Well we already have one but he is terribly busy and hard to reach at times so having someone else who can sort stuff now and then would be great. This is about our flash based overlays which are pretty neat but complex

* **Graphics artist**

Mostly for our show posters, Photoshop are the must know for this one.

* **Chat and forum moderators**

We like to keep moderation pretty loose on our chat, go light on everything else. In-depth guide to this once the group is set up.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Preferably looking for people in the EU timezones
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


* **So why would I want to do this for you guys?**

a) you love us

b) you love victory cat and her kittens

c) we will be giving all our crew members some GD swag and products once the line is up and running

d) chance to play some games with the studio members now and then

e) if you are Stockholm based there can be an extra treat for you.

f) your e-peen might gain a few extra inches



I hope I have everything covered


Thank you.

P.S.: DayZ is a zombie mode for an FPS game Arma II: Arrowhead. You can check out some videos on youtube about it: it's really simple to understand and very hard to play.

Feel free to post any feedback, look up some old VODs, and see descriptions of shows if you're new, as well as the news section for what people from the studio are up to and such.

One other feature that I want to do is the Weekly News roundups, so any news people want to see covered and aggregated gets put together and published on our news page to work as a one stop place to check up on ALL news from the week, big or small. It will also alleviate some of the problems with The GD Show being too long when we spend time just listing off minor topics that don't have much discussion around them, people can just read up on the weekly news on the website to read about smaller events and results, etc.

So

Also funny story, unfortunately Mikael's internet went out so he couldn't transfer anything, and thegdstudio.com just went to a page that said 'hej' and was found and lead to this submission http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1bm0i7/gdstudio_website_now_live/ getting to the top of r/DotA2, lol.

1350344799.0,11jgcs,I think the GD Show did a good job replacing SoTG.,uw_NB,58,7,9,"We used SoTG as a news podcast as people are still learning and playing SC2. Now as majority of the player based has stop playing the game and turn into viewers, contract, etc...

Now as i hear SoTG returning, Tod are pretty much robots with 0 emotion, Major barely speak english and he isnt matured enough to put up good constructive arguments in this sort of panel. Moreover, even though SoTG2.0 will have primary focus on HoTS, the success of the expansion is still relatively unknown atm. The game is still the same and the game type as well as Battlenet 0.2 are still there, making sc2 an antisocial cave which is extremely unattractive to player but at the same time incredibly entertaining for backsit-gaming aka viewers. As of right now the game design procedure is not going as well and having the public exposure via public hearing(davie forum post) simply will spoil the contents therefore reduce the hype as the expansion released. Having such unstable platform to run a show on is an extremely risky idea and i would not be surprised if the show will go on discontinue after 2-3 episodes.


I am a starcraft fan since BW and have been follow esport forever and i would be really sad if my prediction come true. I want to hear the GDStudio crews opinions on this matter

About a month ago I made a competition regarding user-created subscriber emoticons for our Twitch chat. Today we have finally made the selection and implemented those we liked the most. So without further ado I give you the new list of sub-related emotes and their trigger codes (1 missing due to it needing a quick fix from the author):  
http://www.trance.gg/dota/emotes.png or http://twitchemotes.com/

You will also notice a new subscriber badge since we have added Victory cat as an emote.

Out of the picked emotes only one person managed to have 9 picked (hooumeri)

* Hooumeri (9 emotes) - GD Studio hoodie
* Brikton (3 emotes) - ~~GD Studio mousepad~~ (declined mousepad)
* Fusselol (2 emote) - 1 month subscription + GD Studio mousepad
* Guatalian (1 emote) - 1 month subscription
* aiden1337 (1 emote) - 1 month subscription
* jollefjoll (1 emote) - 1 month subscription
* Sneaky_kebab (1 emote) - 1 month subscription

1339537911.0,uyods,The Curious Case Of The Missing Semmler,Metabie,47,2,5,"A random series of events formed together to create a web of mysteries that baffled many and caused for a great episode of the GD Show.

The day started as Weppas woke up late (2pm instead of 1pm) to pick up Apollo from the airport, who was picking up Semmler from the airport (because Semmler took a later flight) tweeted at Trance to give him a call. Semmler was nowhere to be found! And so the search for Semmler started.

The first lead that The GD Studio followed was obviously the airport, but why didn't he meet up with Apollo yet.

Semmler's girlfriend informed them that Semmler had asked for Weppas his phone number at which point Weppas realised he got called at the beginning of the show without picking it up. They dialed the number that called thinking it would be a pay phone at the airport

The GD Studio was out of ideas so they decided to call the airport to do an announcement for a lost person. They obviously had to include that Semmler is a special needs child so it was very important. Time passed and hope was getting lost when Weppas finally decided to check his messages. There were 2 messages , they found out that it was a message from Semmler who had no phone,no money,no working card and was stuck at the airport.

At this point The GD Studio had the great idea to take a 3/4G stick and use it to livestream the entire trip towards the airport and the picking up of Semmler. Right as Trance went to pick up the USB-stick

Turns out his flight had been delayed, his card was blocked and had no money. He was calling Weppas the entire time but he didn't pick up (obviously trying to murder Semmler) because it was from a hidden number. The ladies at the help desk gave Semmler some money for a bus ticket where from he later took a taxi home.

While all of this was going on the power disconnected once and the streaming desktop blue-screened twice

Crazy Story. Crazy Adventure. Hilarious from start to end.

We're planning to add more subscriber emotes to our Twitch chat after the newly implemented dota 2 ones (http://trance.gg/dota/emotes.jpg) and I thought why not have a little competition for it since I'm sure there must be quite a few of you out there with designing skills. Here's how it goes:

**Guidelines**  

* Emotes can only have a maximum size of 60x30 pixels (width x height)
* Don't shy away from creating emotes based on any of our GD-studio related memes (call the dwarf, y u heff to be mad etc)
* Please make an archive and upload your creations somewhere on the web for easy access

**Contest Rules**  

* If we pick 3 or more of your designed emotes you win a GD studio mousepad
* If we pick 9 or more of your designed emotes you win a GD studio hoodie
* If we only pick 1 of your designed emotes you win our appreciation
* We will let this run for about 3 weeks (until 11th of April)

1344100023.0,xod38,ASUS ROG Assembly Summer 2012 - Feedback Thread,Karuramon,41,2,60,"Now that the tournament is over

I think we can all agree that it was in its whole a very good tournament for the viewers in terms of both Games and entertainment. The production value was very good as well. I think we didn't expect anything less from the guys. 

That said the main function of this feedback should be (imo) to go in depth about some things. 

------ 

I'll start with my opinions on a couple of things and you can

-------  

To start off I'd like to say that this style of production reminded me a bit of the HomestoryCup
This mix is great! While we got to see a lot of funny segments, sound and video quality was top notch and despite some confusion on match standings, the visuals that displayed information was good as well.

-------  

**Positive things that should return in future productions:**

**-**Weppas played a great mix of music. Not a repetitive loop of Dubstep and pop-music

**-**Everyone who worked as caster and host. I was skeptical of Soe, bring all of them back!

**-**ALL of the casual behavior! Memes created by the community

**-**Switching the ingame music with other music(two steps from hell stuff) There isn't a lot to say about this. Awesome idea

------ 

**Negative things that I think should be dropped or changed:**

**-**Something I really enjoyed in the GSL are map introductions. Of course just boldly copying another tournament isn't very exciting

**-**Get big ass checks and not those half size things. THAT is very important!



I honestly can't think about anything else that I felt was bad without resorting to nitpicking. Maybe I am too biased

**TL;DR:** ASUS ROG was awesome

Shame on me, i've never played q3 or anything before (shame on me again), but i really liked the game and i am really willing to improve at it. Unfortunately, your l2ps come out far away from often enough.

I know it's hard to learn someone to play a shooter game - it's very much about reflexes and general game sense which is hard to explain. However there is still a lot you can teach.

By the time i am writing this post i have learned a lot by my self: general strategy principles, i find really hard figuring out the best openers for different spawns. Or, i often find myself doing bad decision on controlling yellows to fully choke my opponent, while letting him steal main items.

For guys like me practicing in ql is really difficult, but it gets kind of ridiculously stupid when everyone just spams rockets with no clue.

What i am trying to say by this post, who play the game for around 10 years, to understand the difficulties which players like me face when they are playing. So consulting with a noob can make it easier to choose content for l2p. Also i think that something like teamliquid practice parnters thread would be awesome.

You can contact me via skype:vic_proon

&gt;Paradox Interactive -- a publisher who is getting too old for this -- and Arrowhead Game Studios -- a developer pushed to the edge -- are bringing 80s action movie-inspired game The Showdown Effect to Twitch!

&gt;**WHERE: http://twitch.tv/paradoxinteractive**

&gt;**WHEN: Thursday

&gt;**INFO: http://theshowdowneffect.com/**

&gt;The 2.5D sidescrolling multiplayer combat title
 

&gt;But hey -- this is a video game -- we should just show you what it's about
 

&gt;Ten years ago, still wanted by the government, they survive as soldiers of fortunes. They are... The GD Studio!
 

&gt;The GD Studio will take on Paradox Interactive and Arrowhead Game Studios in a winner-take-all team-based competition, and Arrowhead Game Studios' own ninja squad. Producer Shams Jorjani and Arrowhead CEO Johan Pilestedt will be moderating the action, barefoot and with glass strewn all over the floor, from atop Paradox Tower. 
 

&gt;Four teams. One survivor. All chaos. Way too many clichés. 
 

&gt;Tune into the Paradox Interactive channel on Twitch this Thursday and watch these teams Face Off and Die Hard as they try to draw First Blood with their Lethal Weapon of choice.

**Quote, because of how League of Legends has grown so strong in China. You want more teams from that region. So the four Chinese teams, although they might not win, it gives them a bigger story if one of them gets far""*

There are some other comments

I'd just like to point out that the Dota1 competitive scene 'is' China and the Philippines.  
Take a look at this [list](http://www.gosugamers.net/dota/rankings). Take a look at [DK's achievements](http://www.dota2wiki.com/wiki/DK)

Dota (1 and 2) has been shown on cable TV in China. ECAL hosted a tournament (dota2) which allegedly reached [1.4 million](http://fucknite.mydrm.net/index.php/news/item/48-ecal-%E2%80%93-14-million-viewers-for-inaugural-dota2-showmatch) combined views across tv/online. Although this number is hard to prove, as a casual game and an eSport. (not to mention the [1.5 million international viewers](http://www.facebook.com/joinDOTA/posts/247700551931398), of which only 300k were the english stream)

To add some more numbers [icefrog saying](http://www.dota-utilities.com/2010/05/icefrog-q-session-4.html) China is 40-50% of the dota playerbase

And to many, they're not going to say a European or American team. Anyone who's followed Dota1 knows how many leagues ahead the Chinese scene is, they're more dominant than the Koreans in SC2.

1365747062.0,1c6wun,Just a humble GD studio show idea.,AtreSamus,30,2,14,"**Semmler vs The house**


**What is it?**
It’s Semmler taking on someone else in the house in a number of pre decided games. 
However neither Semmler nor the house member will be playing. 


**Who is it?**
Semmler would be the standing recurring combatant since he has a knack for getting his pants in a twist and everyone else seems willing to troll him. Semmler also have a good but not too good knowledge about a wide array of game styles.

 He would be facing off against a house member that everyone in the house except Semmler himself agrees would do well against him. 

 But neither Semmler nor the other house member would be playing. They would have to recruit someone to play for them. 

Now this is where we can go down two different yet interesting roads; 


**A
Let them recruit anyone they could get hold of for example pro-gamers. This would give the audience a higher level of game to watch


**B
Let them recruit someone that does not play computer games well or preferably not at all. Set up half a day to coaching and teaching the new players while streaming and listening in. Do fun quirky interviews etc. Then in the afternoon/evening you let them play eachother in a nice boX that fits most. This would

 This would serve not only a great entertainment value but also a slightly educational one for viewers who doesnt know how to play that specific game. 

 This also allows Semmler and the challanging house member to be more active by the coaching and lets be honest if they invest personally into the players by coaching and supporting them for a day


A nice and neat bo 5 games/player set ups


**When is it?**
For the B option
 This ofc needs some work


**One step further (optional ofc)!**
I would personally also like to see this being taken just one step further and make this a charity event. Let the guest players each choose a charity organisation to donate the days proceedings to if they win the evenings match. 

  It would be awesome if the ad revenue and the 5€ any new subscribers from that specific day would go towards the charity pot. I have no idea what kind of money that would bring but I imagine it wouldnt be much, or whatever would be a nice ammount, of the revenue money. 

  Maybe this would be to much work before we know if this format of Semmler vs The house would even work and attract viewers but in the best of worlds..!

Maybe it's because I compare it directly to yestedays episode of L2P SC2 with Apollo. But when comparing those two directly I think one can see things that the Dota show could improve on:

**1)** In the SC2 show Apollo was controling the camera, but what we actually needed was CWM explaining and pointing. I also believe this leads into the second point.

**2)** In the SC2 show Apollo did the big chunk of the talking (the guy who teaches basically), it creates this awkward tension between CWM and James, where CWM has to wait for cues from James what to talk about.

**3)** It didn't really seem that the show had a concrete plan

**4)** Kinda similar to point 3. I thought the 'titel' and goal of the lesson weren't quite in sync. I mean the titel was ""Jungling"" right? But all we heard was a mix of general and specific tips on how to play Chen. So what I think you should do is: either change the titel and go super indepth with Chen, Aura Stacking with other heroes etc. OR show some other junglers aswell. For example I'd like to hear how a pro approaches a Lycan, he really isn't that easy to play Jungle with, esp what to buy first, which spawn to creep, to not mess up the start of the game etc.

#### DotA 2 General News

* Information has slowly been pulled out and leaked that Korea DotA 2 is on the uprising. [My Reddit Summary of Situation](http://www.reddit.com/r/thegdstudio/comments/19v026/dota_2_to_korea_news_secerts_and_a_hidden_message/)

* GOMtv - New Teaser Trailer that features DotA 2 in the background. It shows only sc2

* Mr. Chae spoke in interviews with Slasher at IPL5 that they are getting a new studio soon. One of the main reasons is so they can do team games. We all thought it would be like a FPS game or LoL or DotA 2

* But GOMtv already stated they are doing a WoT league (It appears that this league will be invested by the developer because last month the developer said they were putting $2 million in to eSports this year.

* New DotA 2 patch is released - Korean Server [Cyborgmatt's Tweet finding out Korean Servers](https://twitter.com/Cyborgmatt/status/309440225518690306)

* Official Korean DotA 2 Voice/Dubbing Twitter launched [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Dota2KR_Voice)

* One of the first tweets from the account was ""*One of the first tweets is ""DotA 2 Recording this week Tues 05.03 a day has progressed to authentic post from next week'm bringing""

* It appears that DotA2 is going to get totally revamp for the official Korean version. 
________________

* GOM Chung's commets

* First

* Kennigit from TL called in during Live on 3 to talk about all the news that came out for DotA2 recently. He thinks that it is a possibility that GOMTV will host a league.

* During this GOM Chung is in the chat talking and seems really happy. GOM Chung is one of the heads for the international side for GOMTV. He is always talking in chat during GSL

* The chat goes crazy and tells him to call in to the show. Of course he says something like he can't because he is at the GOM office and has no mic.

* Then I asked him in chat ""Is any of this true about DotA 2?"" and then he said ""No Comment""
 
* This is Game (Korean eSports ESPN style company) releases a article [Link Here](http://www.thisisgame.com/board/view.php?id=1469751&amp;category=102)

* My Korean is not the best

* Article also states how DotA 2 is on Nexon's official calendar for release in the second half of 2013 in Korea.

* EDIT: Looks like somebody on Team Liquid translated a lot of it http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=401866#1

* EDIT2: Seems like the GOMTV staff is all about dota 2 recently. Two of their head employee have been playing a lot  [azsharalife](https://twitter.com/azsharalife) [amator](https://twitter.com/amator)

Fiskoo who is a manager for NiP and does work for Valve accidentally leaked out that Valve is going to push CS:GO to a F2P Model and they are going to have some type of event similar to dota 2.

The ASUS ROG Tournament starts today at 14:00 (EEST) and as a bit of fun some of us within the community have decided to run a small raffle whilst the tournament takes place


**How the Raffle Works**


Since this is only a relatively small raffle and was created from people within the community we thought it would be best to limit the amount of participants to the same amount of players that are actually at the event, you have also won first place in the raffle.

Although its only the first 32 Sign ups
One entry per person as well

The aim of this was to have a bit of fun within the gdstudio community and give someone bragging rights for having selected the right player but I also managed to speak to Trance and he was willing to throw in some extra prizes from QPAD (Sponsor of The GD Studio). *See below*

* First Place - *QPAD MK-85 Mechanical Gaming Keyboard and a Signed QPAD GD Studio Mouse pad*

**TL;DR: I want to gather newbies and TGS*-Fans in Quake

Hello everybody! After having watched the first episode of the *Learn to play Quake Live* series I was totally fascinated with the immense depth and awesomeness of this game and immediately created a new account (I already tried Quake back in October

Originally I just wanted to know if anyone else is currently starting to learn Quake and looking for practice partners, who got their interest drawn to these games because of *The GD Studio* and are now also looking for fellow players. Maybe - assuming of course that there are enough people interested  - this (or another) post could become one of those typical ""Looking for practice partners"" threads as seen on [teamliquid.net](http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=328110) for example.

I love the Studio and really believe in its future, where newbies compete against newbies to show how much (or how little) they have learned from the show!? I think this could be a nice addition.

What are your thoughts on that?

**TGS = The GD Studio obviously.*

The idea is each week to run a competition based on a game or mod just for fun!  This could be SC2

Possibly we could alternate each week 1 serious game one silly.
eg. week 1 SC2 1v1
week 2 monobattles
week 3 DOTA2
week 4 DOTA2 ARAM (all random all mid)

We would probably focus on games the GD Studio covers to begin with but could also move into other things like Tribes

1363221668.0,1a9531,"Full of Steam, feedback and suggestions",Exedar,27,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/thegdstudio/comments/1a9531/full_of_steam_feedback_and_suggestions/

I think many of you will agree with me when I say that Full of Steam was pretty sub-par this week and didn't yet live up to its full potential either. So here is some (hopefully constructive) criticism and also some suggestions on how you maybe could imrpove the show.

First of all the positive. I really like the idea of Full of Steam that you just sit down
The show for The Showdown Effect for example was pretty good since you were really into that game and enjoyed playing it and it also was a good game to watch since there was action all the time but it was not repetitive.

Now to the negative part. I think todays (13th March) is a really good example for how the show should not be at all. You didn't really know wich games to play on the show so it seemed you just randomly picked a game (Warframe) you had seen a video or two on youtube and got a betakey for. It was very obvious that neither James nor Skrff had a good idea what the game was all about (except for killing stuff)
It also was crystal clear that you didn't particularly (as in not at all) cared for the game and you didn't seem to want to come back to it any time soon. So that makes me wonder why you would show such a game in the first place except for the reason that you just randomly selected it. Because if you wanted to review it or present your first impressions on it you really have to do it differently (I know you don't like Totalbiscuit but he does that very well in his WTF is...
After that you showed some singleplayer and multiplayer for the new Tomb Raider game. Thats ok-ish I guess but not great in my opinion since if you want to find informations or just watch some gameplay for those AAA titles you kind of only have to go to youtube, especialy games as hyped as Tomb Raider.

So my suggestions to improve the show would be:

- Presenting multiplayer PvP games instead of coop games would drastically enhance the show since it does help to make it more interesting (more fast paced action and/or a competitive aspect to the games) and it also fits better with the studios overall theme of esports and competitive multiplayer games

- Only present singleplayer or coop-games you are really into and wich you like to play. Since this show is (as I understood it) just about you guys playing some games and not reviewing or rating them you should play games you enjoy. If you enjoy the games and the viewers really feel that you want to play them rather then just playing the games for the viewers and the shows sake it is not only much more enjoyable for you but it also makes it in my opinion much more enjoyable and intersting for the viewers (since you will automatcially know more about the games and have more to say about them)

- Knowing about the games you play before the show and not reading up on story, pay2play, fairness and pay2win etc.) and other stuff on the fly. I can imagine that there might not allways be all that much time to prepare for a casual show like this but just getting at least some informations about those things 15 minutes before the show starts and giving the viewers a rough overwiev before you get into the game would in my opinion improve the quality as well

Since it seems you are sometimes out of ideas for games you could show on Full of Steam I will just suggest one or two games now you could have a look at wich would in my opinion fit really well on the show:

1. Blacklight Retribution;
Free 2 play first person shooter (multiplayer only), receivers, magazines, scopes, etc.), some nice unique features like Hyper Reality Vision and Hardsuits (Mechs), customizable armor loadout

2. Star Conflict;
Free 2 play space shooter (multiplayer only, similiar businessmodel to World of Tanks (I know you hate that game but its just the businessmodel, the gameplay is totally different), unlockable ships and equipment are either very similar or identical to the stuff you can buy with real money (you just get earlier access), 3 different ship-classes (interceptor, fighter, frigate), several different maps and gamemodes

Well, keep up the good work!

TL;DR: none

As you might've noticed, I'm going to allow in **subs for The GD Studio**.

If you wish to join here is the following that you should do:

* Post a message in this thread saying something like ""Add me in"" this is so I can check your flair
* And then send me a private message on reddit giving me your google account email. This is not so I can spam you pictures of cute kittens

Rules:

* I will limit only allow a maximum of 50 people into the predictions
* If you mess up the document in anyway
* At this moment there is no mention of prizes so currently the fight is for honor and whoever can beat out Apollo :D
* There will be announcements in a separate thread mentioning times of when predictions have to be given in

The way points will be given out will be discussed in the spreadsheet itself and the spreadsheet will be open to the public to watch.

I was talking to Trance the other day and we want to have a soundboard for  the shows we run here in general. Apparently Trance gets bored when we're running the shows and he wants to press buttons and make noises! 

Now, also, it'd be really cool to have soundbites from things that happened in the studio or shit we said in the past.

So the question is: what sounds do you think would be cool to have? Hopefully nothing too cheesy or excessively cartoony, it's you who'll have to bear with this, so it's cool to have your feedback.

**Quantic Gaming**

This is a team which always seems to do well, they currently only have 4 confirmed players on their roster as Lasthitmagic and Solara were removed from the team after Dreamhack Summer, they then picked up Brax to fill one of their places. However on the positive side they will be able to play with Mikey, who was unable to attend Dreamhack due to travel issues.

So as it stands, Brax, Mikey and PAINTITGOLD as well as a stand-in, although this may not be strictly accurate.

**Statistics**: Won 7/10 of their previous games

**POTM Bottom**

This is a team which I know very little about, taking home 500 euros for their team. 

The POTM Bottom roster includes six people (according to GosuGamers) however I would assume that one of them may be a stand-in/replacement although I may be wrong, Fogged, Aui_2000, TidesofTime and finally WaytoSexy.

**Statistics**: Won 6/10 of their previous matches. including a loss to Quantic and their overall win-rate is also 68% (17-8) and ranked 16^th on GosuGamers

**Copenhagen Wolves**

This is also a team I don't know very much about, over 80 competitive games in total as they were at one-point a team owned by Quantic and have recently broken away from that organisation.

Their roster seems to be more or less stable, Balsam, S4, Henrydickenson and finally neNo.

**Statistics**: Won 5/10 of their previous ten matches as well as having an overall win-rate of 72% (58-23) as well as being ranked 17^th on GosuGamers.

**Absolute Legends**

This team seems to be one of the better known teams, with one member from Singapore and one from Canada, so lag may be a contributing factor for their results here, however one of the reasons that they have become so well known is how they would frequently overcome these issues to place well in online tournaments.

AL also have a six player roster and they are: Snoopy, xMusica, Godot and finally r1sk.

**Statistics**: won 5/10 of the previous games and they have an overall win-rate of 66% (92-48) and ranked 23^rd on GosuGamers.

1362875379.0,19zxun,Quake at DreamHack?,-Venser-,23,3,15,"Any news about Quake at DreamHack?

Quake Live has been growing in the past 6 months. The GD Studio gave it the first needed kick and FACEIT took over. The number of participants in tournaments has increased (last FACEIT almost hit the registration limit) and Sunday cups gather over 4K viewers regularly now and I don't think it's bad figure for a $125 weekly online tournament. There is still interest in Quake. FACEIT increased the production value and prize money grew across all tourneys. Finally we see some leagues forming instead of just regular tournaments and the pros are returning to the scene (Cooller, Baksteen, Sev3n...). Quake is not dead. In fact it's in better shape than it has been in a long time. What I want to say is that Quake scene holds up on it's own but it's very disconnected from the general esport community and DreamHack is the last bridge between them. We must not let it fall. So James please do some magic and bring Quake to DreamHack ;)

1/I feel like a lot of news were under appreciated. Most of the asian dota news are quite ignored simply because none of you have a long enough history with DotA that could appreciate such movement. Some news like the fnatic.NA team requires insight from the NA scene so most of your conclusion are mainly lack of bases. In comparison

2/Tournament result: I think this is something you simply cant just 'talk about'. There are a lot of contents that you could put on WHILE talking about a final or a play off of a tournament. The highlight function inside dota2 would be put in great use right here. Using those to down/up talk players

3/Betting: how about some betting? not money, create stories.... And its also promoting the ingame micro transaction. Not even counting that by looking into the betting ods, its a free survey of the audience on pre-game expectation and fan-favorite.

4/Addressing the reason why you dont have much to talk about. Isnt it mainly because the scene is new and lack of content site? DotAbuff new match making poll(may be interview the guy who made the site)

5/Dont forget to ASK for content suggestions. Personally i have a lot of ideas

**Tuesday** - 

GOMTV releases a teaser for their new Gangnam Studio [Link Here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e14eG6g3JhE)

*The video featured some highlights from DotA 2 in the background of some scenes.

*You may ask, World of Tanks (Which GOMTV already announced they are hosting a league in a couple months), and then DotA2.

*I also recall a interview Mr. Chae did with Slasher at IPL5. Where he stated that he wanted to add more leagues for different games to GOMTV. Slasher kept pushing on asking what games

*One of the reasons stated for moving to the new studio was because it was a lot bigger. Also it makes it possible to host ""team"" games.

*Everybody thought one of the team games only could be like LoL



New DotA 2 patch is released - Korean Server [Link Here](https://twitter.com/Cyborgmatt/status/309440225518690306)

*Cyborgmatt does his usual break down of the patch and finds that a Korean server is planning to be launched

**Wednesday** -

Official Korean DotA 2 Voice/Dubbing Twitter launched [Link Here](https://twitter.com/Dota2KR_Voice)

*One of the first tweets is ""DotA 2 Recording this week Tues 05.03 a day has progressed to authentic post from next week'm bringing""



GOM Chung's commets

*First

*Kennigit from TL called in during Live on 3 to talk about all the news that came out for DotA2 recently. He thinks that it is a possibility that GOMTV will host a league.

*During this GOM Chung is in the chat talking and seems really happy. GOM Chung is one of the heads for the international side for GOMTV. He is always talking in chat during GSL

*The chat goes crazy and tells him to call in to the show. Of course he says something like he can't because he is at the GOM office and has no mic.

*Then I asked him in chat ""Is any of this true about DotA 2?"" and then he said ""No Comment""

**Thursday**

This is Game (Korean eSports ESPN style company) releases a article [Link Here](http://www.thisisgame.com/board/view.php?id=1469751&amp;category=102)

*My Korean is not the best

*Article also states how DotA 2 is on Nexon's official calendar for release in the second half of 2013 in Korea.

*EDIT: Looks like somebody on Team Liquid translate alot of it http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=401866#1

What does all this mean?
Well who knows. Let just wait and see.
OR we can get select to be a secret agent and find out information since he speaks that secret Korean language. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

I've recently been thinking that it'd be pretty interesting to somehow track how many times the respective teams stacks the neutral creep camps in the jungle / ancients. 


And then going over the stats post-game as; 

-How many *extra* creep cams were spawned during the game? 

-Which team *stacked the most*?

-Which team were more efficient in utilizing the *extra gold*

-Perhaps have a leaderboard and check which team is doing the **most** and the *least* neutral creeps stacking. A few months ago now I remember noTidehunter was notorious for stacking ancients a lot

**Learn2Play**

I did not watch the BLC content, mostly because I know more about that game. 

I think a good help will be to announce a few days before the L2P

Lastly, but it should not be required.

**The GD Show**

I really liked the first show. But it became pretty clear that not everyone knows as much from every game as the others. Incontrol had to carry the SC2 part while Semler and 2GD had to carry the BLC parts. It would be a more interesting show if you had a conversation about the recent news instead of presenting the news like on television.

NewmaN was not looking really comfortable

I don't know if quests are going to be calling in like on LO3? It might be nice to get some different perspectives from people not present at the studio.

**New show on Monday | Will and Skrff**

I like the idea of an even more casual show. This could be good fun. It would be even more fun if the games are not actually being reviewed (No marks etc.) Just casually play the games and have fun. Maybe even have 1 guest from other shows hop in. 1 Show with dApollo and another one with Semmler for example.

An idea I got from this was the following. A casual game night (After this show) where the hosts play games with  the viewers. This way it doesn't have to interfere with the L2P's and you don't really have to play BLC, especially if some alcohol is involved.

**Thank You** a lot for doing this. I like every show and it seems to improve everytime. I love that you guys are listening to the community and actually using there input.

----

Hopefull other viewers also have some feedback or good ideas. After this Meeting I guess this is a good place to collect it.

1. (Storylines) I think the way the results are presented needs to be changed. Before when it was live you could just show the results develop as the voting occured, asking which team will win and then showing the results following the map bringing up a point of discussion with the analysts. Having these story lines will obviously help make each match, and personalize the games which is huge for the viewers.
2. (Flow) At times when the voting ended it seemed quite awkward when it was announced that the voting ended, not the play by play or one of the analysts. It is their job to chip in, in between points of action, with bursts of information so it seems better if the color caster just drops in with ""the voting has ended now, and we'll take a look at the results later in the game"", or something similar to that.

1364254213.0,1b08q5,My feedback on the broadcast of the Dreamhack Invitational,sheldon__,8,0,14,"Hi there!

You guys really stepped up the game in e-sports broadcasting with the pre-game statistics, and some things are really preventing me as a viewer from having a really good experience, as opposed to a just-above-average experience. Here are my points, most of them based on things I observed from your stream:

1. Camera control vs. Commentator talk

You guys are working with Skrffz as an external camera man right? This is a nice idea, more interesting stuff is going on. Listening to the commantators and trying to catch their subject on camera, but still switch the target as soon as the next sentence finishes. I also highly suggest Skrffz to wear headphones or earplugs while the game is going on (if he doesn't already do so), in the game between nth &amp; Dignitas he missed a pretty obvious kill just outside of his screen he could have easily caught if he had sound (you could hear Gyro Ult &amp; Skewer).

On the other hand, and although I don't know what you guys are having on them, I suggest one showing Skrffz camera, and one being a second camera for the second commantator, to get some additional information to contribute. Give James or Draskyl or whoever is the main commentator for the specific game Skrffz camera to commentate what is going on, and the second camera to control for the co-caster to get more detailed insight in the game!

This is my biggest point I feel I HAVE to make

2. Voice

Try to use more ""determined"" language, ""actually""! (This concerns for anyone but Waga and Bruno). I know this probably sounds really cocky from ""just a spectator"" to demand you to change your style of language, but there is evidence that constant repitition of certain phrases by a person lower the viewer's interest in the subject the person is talking about. 

Second point about that: Try to bring in more enthusiasm! James and Weppas, raise your voice and generate an atmosphere where the viewer is tied to the action!

This is it, Valve would be forced to make TI3 even more awesome, how great would that be?

I hope you guys appreciate the feedback and import some of this into your broadcasts!

Carlucci wondered where would a man come from at this hour, since the nearest bar is no less than 30 kilometers from this humble village and no-one can traverse the pampa without any clothes on a wintery night like this. Nevertheless, the old man felt a strong urge that he could not explain to let the stranger in his house.

The latest footages we have of blizzard dota date back to the last blizzcon 2 years(?) ago where their heros were riding mounts and towers could run out of ammo? The game were discussed over on Teamliquid dota thread as 'horrid' 'unfinished' and 'developers have no clue what they are doing'. After that it was reported that blizz all star had been completely rebooted around August 2011.

With the current schedule for 2013, Blizzard All Stars will be free-to-play(after paying for HotS ofc). However, with the late development of the Diablo3 promised PvP system, one could really question what exactly Blizzard is doing with their time.

3/Prepare contents for pauses in game. May be a disclose interview with players before the games(ask them about strategy etc... what they want to tell fan mid game?) happen, not like BTS where they just play funny videos/VODs over and over again for the last 1 year. This could be key into leveling up production value.

4/ For dreamhack inv. you guys had a team/players hightlight section that was done by skrff. Even though it was good, live feed from the players/pubstomps attendees.

I think we are completely indebted to the players for our entertainment. I simply do not think the skill cap and watch-ability of a game determines its success as an esport. I think you need the commitment and multi-year experience that DOTA 1 has brought us to make something like DOTA 2 possible. Even with the thousand of hours and daily full time practice of these players you still have viewers and fans flaming the likes of Black for his original mouseports performance

So I could only imagine how terrible and un-watchable DOTA 2 would be with a second tier of players taking the main-stage at events

For me when, in that order. I am of the perspective that without these mulit-year dota pros the casting alone can't provide me enough entertainment to spend the money and take the time to watch DOTA over real sports, or whatever I'm neglecting during the playoffs of a big tournament. Yet despite this reliance on these players and their skill and commitment you constantly see on JD and Reddit a sentiment regarding the lack of professionalism by these individuals, despite the fact they make SO SO SO little money for doing something we get SO SO SO many hours of enjoyment out of. 

I just can't stand by and watch tournaments like JD decide to create team rankings to impose monetary penalties on these guys who are in school or rely on jobs and family to give us the many hours of amazing dota we consume. Many months ago I even wrote a long post on JD suggesting that teams draft an agreement, communication, and behavior because tournaments obviously weren't treating them as the main attraction, as the source of power for viewers eyes and dollars.  http://forum.gamesports.net/dota/showthread.php?8418-Dota-2-Pros-should-form-a-union

In the current immature state of DOTA there are so few dollars to be made and only so much time on the weekends that I feel like tournaments should be more than willing to wait 30+m for a team to get OUT OF ANOTHER MATCH to join their game. Shit

In short,000+ a year, enough to make it their lives for the foreseeable future. DOTA and esports is basically a hobby at this point, (for 99% of participants), a moment to fly close to the sun, not of one's life's work.  

If tournaments aren't respectful of these people, dota and esports won't grow. In my mindset, cancelling games is the EXACT opposite of what tournaments should be doing to promoting the community, growth and the support/viewership of the players and teams we want to see.

Combining these 2 will create some interesting game play and somewhat balance since each team will want to pick the most useless heroes for the other team and ban what they cant use.

You know how hard it is to schedule games. You know that weekends are really busy. And in this case

It is one thing to punish a team who doesn't show up, this is just punishing a team for the conditions and state of competitive games right now. 

It really shows a lack of maturity

Really most of all it punishes the viewers. I personally just stayed home to watch dota.  I pay $5 a month and bought an in-game ticket but for some reason you guys think it is better to stand on illogical principle that can't differentiate between whether a team is missing or simply delayed in  another match of another tournament

You did nothing but hurt the community

You guys were too pussy to deal with players sniping your stream and you are too pussy to to realize and deal with the mistake in your ruler regarding why a team isn't on time

I like your show. Draskyll you are my favorite caster. But man you guys are making me wonder why I give you money. 

*edit it is 6pm est. I am done posting. I am glad we had the opportunity to argue

**edit 2 - I thought about it over dinner and decided to cancel my sub. I just can't get over how shitty of a place the DOTA 2 community scene would be if everyone just cancelled games like this. A B03 can last anywhere from 50m to 3.5 hours and tournament organizers should understand that players MUST play in as many as possible to make any money whatsoever.  Instead of punishing viewers and teams you guys should be busy promoting whatever else the other team is playing in and respect and understand the state of the scene.  T

You can't always plan ahead perfectly but you can certainly wait 30m. Today Fnatic thought they were going to be 10m late and they were wrong, a BO1 was scheduled 2 HOURS BEFORE THIS MATCH.**  IF GD studio thinks this is a good reason to cancel I don't want to give you my money.
