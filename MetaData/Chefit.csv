Dear restaurant owners and operators, but let me tell you that a good ad is even more scarce. Here are a few pointers:

1. Include the name of your restaurant and its location. Most people want to know where they are applying to before they send out their resume

2. If you do not feel comfortable including your restaurant's name

3. Be descriptive. Don't post an ad that simply says ""busy restaurant in Prov seeks cook."" Tell me about your place

4. ""Seeking an individual with experience working grill, and garde manger. Must be able to work independently. Starting pay is $10/hr."" If you want quality help, then you're going to have to pay for it. 

5. While we're on the subject of money, or nonexistent. 

6. I can't pay my rent with valuable job experience, but I also love having a roof over my head and gas in my car. You are on glue if you think that any cook out there is passionate enough about cooking to disagree with me on those points. 

7. DO NOT POST AN AD WITH ALL CAPS AND NO PUNCTUATION IT WILL MAKE ME WONDER ABOUT THE MENTAL STATUS OF THE PERSON I COULD POTENTIALLY BE WORKING FOR AND I READ IT AS IF YOURE SHOUTING AT ME.

8. Seriously

9. Know the difference between a sous chef and a prep cook

1372556569.0,1hcbo8,"Finally in a ""real"" kitchen and the job makes me feel guilty",wanttobeacook,21,3,26,"So I am going to make this post rather short

First, I thrive on the stress of it all. Sadly, because I had no experience any time I tried to apply at a real restaurant I would always be turned down. So, because of this, I found solace working in fast food and actually enjoyed my time making fast food. Still, I wanted to work in a real kitchen and when I found my self needing a job because of a move, I applied at every place I could think of... including one of the most renown local restaurants in my new area.

Well I didn't get the job, so when I few months later I got a call from the renown restaurant I jumped at the chance of another interview.

I actually got the job this time, or if nothing else, a big stepping stone to my dream job. Any one you ask about this place goes on and on about how all the recipes are created by the owner and his wife, how the food is local and fresh etc. You know the spiel.

Turns out, hell the bread for their sandwiches is the cheapest bread available at the local super market and the meat they use on their sandwiches is oscar-meyer brand crap.

On top of that I am the only one there that follows proper hand washing procedures. I am currently being trained in how the store runs, has mentioned cleanliness or cross contamination. Last night I watched some one make a chicken fried steak using the breading for the chicken (which I should add is a premade seasoning mixture) with out batting an eyelash. It seems like my old job in fast food was much cleaner and safer than this bloody place.

Now, here I feel like the people are spending all this money just for the good view (the place is in a prime location).

On top of that I am worried that this place will ruin my chances in future jobs. Some day, a place that is what this place is supposed to be. Assuming I leave here with a good reference and some ""experience"" under my belt that shouldn't be too much of a problem. Yet, how do I explain when I get hired at a new place that I actually have no real experience? That the last place I worked was glorified fast food?

I know this could be stupid to post, at the very least I know a McDonalds is clean and doesn't lie about what it is... the only thing stopping me is that I really need the money. ",,False,self,t5_2s1da,False,,

The kitchen I've worked in for the past four years does not have mats so there's no cushioning. I basically cycle through a bunch of cheap cast off shoes I get at thrift stores supplemented with CVS-bought sole inserts to lift my heels a bit and support my arches.

My back doesn't hurt at work but once I get home and sit down and relax it is very painful for the first 30 minutes or so. For the first time in a long time I'm looking to invest in a very good pair of shoes that will make my back feel good again

Thoughts? Suggestions? Right now I'm looking at croc-style shoes but I have no idea how comfortable they are and whether they'd work with soles. On the plus some of the guys at work have them and they like to gather tribally at the dish washer and run their shoes through once in a while. It's kind of endearing in a David Attenborough-ought-to-narrate-this kind of way because they're all standing around on white linen napkins staring at each other trying to pretend this is what normal people do.

UPDATE: I went with the [Shoes For Crews Santa Cruz](https://www.shoesforcrews.com/sfc3/index.cfm?changeWebsite=US_en&amp;route=c_store.viewDetailsOfProduct&amp;partnumber=6044&amp;size=) model. I have pretty wide feet and usually wear extra wide skates when I play hockey

The difference in my legs, and I'm still not sure if I do or not but having that support means that at the end of the day my feet feel like they're only been working for a few hours.

The difference has carried over into my sleeping patterns and my off hours. There's a lot less back pain

My problem is that I simply can’t get work as a line cook, or even prep, as one look at my resume screams dishwasher, and there are always more experienced applicants getting ahead of me, even when I ace the interview. I want to work at an establishment long-term, I’m not moving anymore or switching schools or quitting because I’m a student. I live in Guelph, Ontario, get a dishwashing position where my employer would be willing to train me later on.

What would I put on my resume? What would my cover letter look like? Is my one reference from a previous sous chef enough? When applying in person

7. Would new equipment be bought more often to replace old equipment that isn't working as well any more or to update technology?

**A bit of background:**

I work for a company that creates unique, art, urban exploring, everything!

Some of our most popular experiences are the culinary ones. We bring on talented chefs

The chefs we have worked with in the past love it because it takes them out of the restaurant and lets them engage with guests in a new way and help develop their personal brand (not to mention earn good money).

FYI

**My question to you:**

What would be the best way to go about finding new and talented chefs that would be interested in something like this?  It's a freelance / part-time gig. A lot of the chefs we have already are working in other restaurants.

I know chefs are notoriously busy and are approached every day from Groupon-like sites.  

Are there other ways to present this offer to them?  Any culinary-specific job boards that we could post on?

You are always in the way..doesnt matter where you stand.  you are in the way.

The dish guy is your best friend.  Learn his favoriate drink and food.  Make them.  Offer to pay for his kids college..  You will learn his language that night.

When you hear ""Hot behind""  Do not turn

Here are the 30 standard recipies.  Memorize them...now.  You will never make them

Between 5:30 and 7pm on Friday,  he will know exactly what is on it and have it 1/2 complete before its finished printing.  And the ticket printer..its under that counter..over there, out of sight, but he will still know whats on it.

Chef language will make sailors blush.

Find the mop and broom.  That is your job.  Love it.

I’m a young chef who just got fired as the Executive Chef from a local restaurant. While I was looking for a job I was approached by an investor with no professional experience and belief that starting a food cart operation with me would be successful. In return for my experience and knowledge he is fronting the upstart cost solely.
The concept:
With limited space and cooking surfaces I thought homemade gourmet sausages were a good choice. Some examples would be a tempeh sausage with a miso slaw. Wild mushroom (morel, roasted red peppers, goat cheese and finished with a honey/truffle aioli.  Jalapeno, bacon and smoked cheddar topped with full bodied red wine pickled onions. Everything would follow a similar formula: 1 healthy, 1 upscale-ish and 1 “Americana”. We would also offer black board sandwich specials and an assortment of unique fries. Sweet potato with maple ketchup, purple fingerlings with Andouille ketchup, yucca with banana ketchup ect. We would offer fresh juice, house made komboocha and h2o as beverages. The fresh juices from frozen
The request for advice:
To those of you who have worked in a street vendor situation what is the best way to get the ball rolling and what problems have you faced in the startup of the process? I live in R.I. so permits and licensing aren’t as big of a hassle as other areas in the states. How did you market your product? Do you have many repeat customers… and if so how did you choose your locations? What are the most important things to look for in my cart? Does my concept sound appealing to you as a possible patron? Can I preform my prep on site or will I need to rent space? How long did it take you to earn a profit? How many people do you serve a day on average?

I had taken a sabbatical from my current restaurant to accept an offer to run a bar.  I was gone for about a year when I saw an ad on craigslist from my old restaurant looking for a KM.  

My old chef was gone but two of my old co-workers had been promoted to kitchen manager.  The owner was opening a third restaurant but needed more kitchen help.  He instantly hired me back as a co-KM at the restaurant I -reviously worked at.   

It was a very smooth transition because I already knew everything about the restaurant.  Things were going great for a couple of weeks until my co-manager figured out that anything he didn't do I would have to do  make up for because I actually cared about the job I was doing.  It slowly degenerated until the owner stepped in and dismissed him for not pulling his share of the load.

Now finally this is where my question for some of you more experienced chefs comes in.  When he dismissed the other co-manager a cook was promoted again to be co-manager.  Even though he makes the same amount of money as me I do all the product ordering (food and beverages), menu item pricing.  

Also the same thing is happening as before, or something else I haven't thought up yet?

Update:  Thanks for the responses.  I went to owner with issues and he had a meeting and cleared up the problem.  I am now sole kitchen manager

Don't get me wrong, and help out everyone else whenever I can. I'm not lazy, I bust my ass day in and day out, and don't have too much of a problem with any aspect of work as of the moment. I have a lot of passion for what I do, and always want to learn and always am excited to see new things.

I've no trouble with long hours and low pay right now, but as I hear, hours only get longer and the pay doesn't get very much better later on(though money is honestly a non-issue).

I guess I'm asking this because I don't know if people actually know what they're asking for when they say ""well-done"" and you (the chef) assume they (the customer) don't know and you're sending out something better so you don't get roasted (pardon the pun) for being a poor chef.

Every cook dreams to work for the best chefs in the largest city’s doing food people fly across the world to enjoy. Being regarded a top restaurant though comes with a price. Standards and discipline can’t just come from a chef that has years of experience
It was one of the best experiences I have ever had in my life because not only did I become a harder working individual from it


The bar was set almost too high in most cases, a “make it happen” mentality when all resources are expended yet projects still get done. The process in which all your efforts are needed throughout the course of a day to get done, what needs to be done no matter how heavy the load. 


You might think you know what I’m talking about


Day in and day out, no ones effort where ever really recognized. It’s twisted but no one was happy to work there. A sense of pride came along with saying, “I work at ______________________”, but the sacrifices that came along with it never really made up for that sense of pride. 


So you begin to ask yourself how much more can I sacrifice, look the chef in the eyes, shake his hand and walked out the back door. These individuals where never heard from again, and never spoke of because they were weak, but you envied them because you were supposed to walk out at that moment instead of them. Now you have to work double time, picking up whatever they where responsible for. You work twice as hard as you normally would and somehow you survive another day, but just like everyone else on the line your days are numbered. Just like every one else


It’s a physical and mental challenge you have to commit to, and accidents never happen. It broke my heart to leave ________ and for months afterwards I regretted the decision, because I knew would never experience something as great as that again. It was a life changing experience that has me still looking back and wondering how I ever managed to survive it.

So I recently got laid off from a small italian restaurant I was working at. I have two years of cooking experience and have done various stations; garde, grill and a bit of desserts. It only took me a day or two to get in contact with an old sous chef of mine who needs cooks at his restaurant. I went today for a stage and it was alright. 

The people were cool, two stations that I didn't really have in mind for my experience. But in general, he needs strong people. I tell him that I can be that person, but I need to think about it. I've worked in a similar environment to this one and I'm not sure if I will learn anything from it again. I constantly am trying to get to a restaurant that is 'better' in some scale to where I worked at.

Here are the pros:

- Restaurant is causal, which means $$$)

- I get to 'restart' my career in some way, I could avoid. All the knowledge I've gained could be really useful. 

- I get a decent benefits package and a raise after three months (I've worked for the restaurant's company before

- I could really stand out and catch the chef's eye. This could lead to maybe a tournant position or something

- the menu has a lot of variety

cons:

- most of the people I would work with are unprofessional and emotional (I saw people bickering about each other on more than one count. I know this happens in kitchens a lot

- Food quality could have been better. I have high standards

- People didn't keep their cutting boards clean. They were covered with wet, or keep them folded in sanitized water for cleaning. 

That's all I gotta say. What do you think reddit? I'm an asshole

EDIT: I wanted to thank all you guys for commenting. Still thinking. I have a stage tomorrow at a well-known fine dining restaurant (position is commis chef). We'll see how it goes and then i'll decide what 'role' I want to play.

My whole life I've been around food, and have been cooking alongside my family in the kitchen as long as I can remember. As I grew up, fine dining became a routine thing for my family, as we all got more and more interested in cuisine.

I am currently 23 years old and I have a Bachelors Degree in Journalism and Public Relations. I love to cook and I believe I am good at it. I have a job at a newspaper where I work in the creative department where I do layout and design for newspapers and magazines. I also write a weekly food column for the paper. (I have held this job for ~18 months.


I feel like it is time for me to make a move to get closer to my dream job. I applied and interviewed for (and think I was pretty close to getting) an internship position at Cooking Light Magazine


Another position that I think I would enjoy and be good at has the following requirements:

* BA/BS (or equivalent) in Journalism

* 2+ years of experience in an editorial

* Culinary degree and/or research background highly desirable


I am also lucky enough to have gotten my BA without having any students loans. Also

For the 4th year in a row
Here’s the line up for the 2013 Local Foods Week tours:

Skillet exemplifies seasonal driven and ingredient centered menu. If you haven’t tried their farm to fork comfort classics you have been missing out. Their breakfasts are famous
The Coop is a popular-locavore food truck that’s found a home as a pop-up inside the historic Hey Hey bar. Talented chef Angie Theado runs the Coop and as the name suggests they explore creative preparations of poultry and game. You’ll probably even get to try some local duck eggs!
The Hills Market‘s much anticipated downtown store opened early this year. It’s a great destination to find locally produced foods of all types
Brothers Drake Meadery are passionate about local sourcing and also local selling. They don’t distribute their product outside Columbus. You will be visiting their production space and tasting room and sampling some of the meads made with local ingredients such as pawpaw and spicebush berries. If the word mead makes you think of renaissance fairs
Knead  opened in July 2010 and made it clear from the outset that they were serious about local sourcing. The name ‘Knead’ was chosen to suggest that they try to make everything from scratch from breads to pastas to sausage. They shop at the North Market

I'm the Sous chef at a very busy steakhouse where our Executive is several years my junior

We've been working pretty well together for the last year

The mother of his child(not his current girlfriend) can't stay out of jail because of prescription pill abuse and probation violations, on a semi-regular basis. Since being taken off salary(due to his side work for a now failing restaurant that never paid him for his ""consultation"") he routinely forgets to clock in or sign the back-up log, so at the end of the pay-period he can just jot down his hours without any verification or accountability; which, low and behold, almost always add up to his approximate ""hours"" from his previous, salary.

The kid's had a rough life, and his dad succumbed to cancer after a short, brutal battle. He has overcome great odds stacked against him, and has risen above his station in life through dedication, hard work, and luck, something I respect immensely.

But the fact remains

Every sous chef aspires to someday be an Executive. It's in the job description. But don't get me wrong, or this wonderful establishment fail.

My grandma always recommended a paring knife that was sharp but not razor sharp for the obvious reason that if you slip you could well chop your thumb off. This can't be how chefs do it can it? Its one thing to make an apple pie now and then but when you do this for a living it would seem that that kind of technique would be hazardous and ill-advised?
