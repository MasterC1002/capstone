So about 5 years ago my father was with his girlfriend and my two sisters making a trip across the country. It was a business/pleasure trip

Well anyways, my father apparently had issues finding the runway on his approach (yes, he was instrument rated.) Well, one thing led to another, and the plane hit some power lines causing it to crash into a house. Luckily, nobody was in the house, but everyone in the plane died.

Fast forward 2 years. The accident had a major toll on me, and came to the conclusion that I had to do something. One day, when I was 19 years old, I walked into an Air Force recruiting office and started the process of signing up for the military. I was lucky enough to get my second choice of job, air traffic controller.

Today, and I was lucky enough to get stationed back at home. Ironically enough, one of the civilian air ports that I control as a radar controller was the airport that my dad flew in and out of every day.

Me and my student-pilot/girlfriend, quiet, low key way to bring in the new year, right? Well we're doing a wide two mile circle at 1,200' around downtown where they have a huge fireworks display on the river. I'm flying slow with 10 degrees of flaps out at about 65mph and waiting for midnight when I heard a loud POP and the feeling of being hit by shattered material. I flinch as I throw my head down between the seats and look up at Alpha, who is OK but wide-eyed. I've had a Rosen visor break on me once so that's what immediately came to mind. I scanned the windshield from right to left, checked the visors, I got that sick feeling of warm blood running down my neck

I patted the back of my head to make sure I wasn't seriously cut from the shattered pieces of the window, brought up the flaps, and changed my heading to our airport that was just over 4 miles away before giving her the flight controls. I took off my headset and jacket, bundled it up and used it to apply pressure to the back of my head. I took the controls back, called CTAF, and landed without an issue. Fireworks going off all over the place while on short final pissed me off and gave me a decent time reference.

Most boss part of it all was when I shut off the engine. I got out, I was honestly at 1,200'.

We buttoned everything up and cleaned my head enough to see how bad it was. About an inch long gash. We go to get my dome stapled up (5 staples) and she has the bright idea to ask the doctor if it was broken window fragments or possibly the bullet that got me. He tells us that my neck was lightly marred from the plastic fragments but that the gash on my head was not a slice with a flap

Yesterday they found the bullet in the plane while taking the headliner out and the airplane owner took it to the police. They didn't say at the moment what they thought about it

I'm not surprised that it happened, there's nobody to be mad at, yet. I've waited until today to tell the news about it because I figure the longer the time passes between now and NYE, the more likely it is the the people around the shooter, assuming it was a backyard party, have talked enough that at least one unsupporting person has heard it and would be willing to turn them in.

Got this on my retired UAL pilot forum from a fellow I knew both in the Navy and at UAL. We were in the same cadet officer class back in 1965. He went on to fly A-7's and F-8's and later to Eastern Airlines and to UAL after Eastern's bankruptcy. While at UAL he worked in the training center as an instructor most of the time. I happened to check him out in the B737 for the ""flying the line"" portion of training. He is a good pilot and has an excellent background



After I retired from UAL as a Standards Captain on the –400, right seat, left seat taking a decade or two. One big difference is that ex-Military pilots are given super-seniority and progress to the left seat much faster. Compared to the US, they also upgrade fairly rapidly because of the phenomenal growth by all Asian air carriers. By the way, after about six months at Asiana, I was moved over to KAL and found them to be identical. The only difference was the color of the uniforms and airplanes. I worked in Korea for 5 long years and although I found most of the people to be very pleasant, it’s a minefield of a work environment ... for them and for us expats.



One of the first things I learned was that the pilots kept a web-site and reported on every training session. I don’t think this was officially sanctioned by the company, what to expect on checks, and what to look out for. For example; I used to open an aft cargo door at 100 knots to get them to initiate an RTO and I would brief them on it during the briefing. This was on the B-737 NG and many of the captains were coming off the 777 or B744 and they were used to the Master Caution System being inhibited at 80 kts. Well, for the first few days after I started that, EVERYONE rejected the takeoff. Then, all of a sudden they all “got it” and continued the takeoff (in accordance with their manuals). The word had gotten out. I figured it was an overall PLUS for the training program.



We expat instructors were forced upon them after the amount of fatal accidents (most of the them totally avoidable) over a decade began to be noticed by the outside world. They were basically given an ultimatum by the FAA, Canada, Australia, or New Zealand with a few stuffed in from Europe and Asia. Boeing also operated training centers in Singapore and China so they did hire some instructors from there.



This solution has only been partially successful but still faces ingrained resistance from the Koreans. I lost track of the number of highly qualified instructors I worked with who were fired because they tried to enforce “normal” standards of performance. By normal standards, after 5 years, they finally nailed me. I still had to sign my name to their training and sometimes if I just couldn’t pass someone on a check, I had no choice but to fail them. I usually busted about 3-5 crews a year and the resistance against me built. I finally failed an extremely incompetent crew and it turned out he was the a high-ranking captain who was the Chief Line Check pilot on the fleet I was teaching on. I found out on my next monthly trip home that KAL was not going to renew my Visa. The crew I failed was given another check and continued a fly while talking about how unfair Captain Brown was.



Any of you Boeing glass-cockpit guys will know what I mean when I describe these events. I gave them a VOR approach with an 15 mile arc from the IAF. By the way, I gave him vectors to final with a 30 degree intercept. Of course, he failed to “Extend the FAF” and he couldn’t understand why it would not intercept the LNAV magenta line when he punched LNAV and VNAV. He made three approaches and missed approaches before he figured out that his active waypoint was “Hold at XYZ.” Every time he punched LNAV, it would try to go back to the IAF ... just like it was supposed to do. Since it was a check, I was not allowed (by their own rules) to offer him any help. That was just one of about half dozen major errors I documented in his UNSAT paperwork. He also failed to put in ANY aileron on takeoff with a 30-knot direct crosswind (again, the weather was dictated by KAL).



This Asiana SFO accident makes me sick and while I am surprised there are not more, they will eventually be fired too. One of the best trainees I ever had was a Korean/American (he grew up and went to school in the USA) who flew C-141’s in the USAF. When he got out, he moved back to Korea and got hired by KAL. I met him when I gave him some training and a check on the B-737 and of course, he breezed through the training. I give him annual PCs for a few years and he was always a good pilot. Then, he got involved with trying to start a pilots union and when they tired to enforce some sort of duty rigs on international flights, he was fired after being arrested and JAILED!



The Koreans are very very bright and smart so I was puzzled by their inability to fly an airplane well. They would show up on Day 1 of training (an hour before the scheduled briefing time, putting that information to actual use was many times impossible. Crosswind landings are also an unsolvable puzzle for most of them. I never did figure it out completely, but I think I did uncover a few clues. Here is my best guess. First off, their educational system emphasizes ROTE memorization from the first day of school as little kids. As you know, that is the lowest form of learning and they act like robots. They are also taught to NEVER challenge authority and in spite of the flight training heavily emphasizing CRM/CLR, it still exists either on the surface or very subtly. You just can’t change 3000 years of culture.



The other thing that I think plays an important role is the fact that there is virtually NO civil aircraft flying in Korea. It’s actually illegal to own a Cessna-152 and just go learn to fly. Ultra-lights and Powered Hang Gliders are Ok. I guess they don’t trust the people to not start WW III by flying 35 miles north of Inchon into North Korea. But, F-5, F-15, and F-16 pilots who were actually terrible pilots if they had to hand fly the airplane. What a shock!


Finally



Actually, he calls for the autopilot to be engaged at 250’ after takeoff. How much actual flight time is that? Hardly one minute. Then he might fly for hours on the autopilot and finally disengage it (MAYBE?) below 800’ after the gear was down, flaps extended and on airspeed (autothrottle). Then he might bring it in to land. Again, how much real “flight time” or real experience did he get. Minutes! Of course, on the 777 or 747, it’s the same only they get more inflated logbooks.



So, it raises the hair on the back of my neck",,False,self,t5_2qhu8,False,,
