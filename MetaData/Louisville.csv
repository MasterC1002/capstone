I am a student in Iowa, I get to Chicago the night before my interview, and after my plane gets delayed for 4 hours, it gets canceled.  I am super frustrated because this was a company I really wanted to work for and didn't want to miss my interview.  So I am waiting in line at the airport to figure out what my options are.  
  
I start to make small talk with the guy in line next to me, we figure out that we can't get on any other flights that night, and it's about 12am.  So I'm making phone calls trying to get ahold of people, when he comes up and says to me ""Hey I can just rent a car and drive us both back to Louisville so you can get to your interview.""  
  
So that's what we did.  We left around 1am and drove for 5 hours to get to Kentucky.  He drove the whole way so I could try to get some sleep since we were going to be cutting close on time.  I had to be at the company by 7:30am... and we arrived at 6:30, and made it on time :)  I ended up getting an offer and will be returning to Louisville this summer!

...we would like to put together a reddit get-together in Louisville!

We are thinking CHEROKEE park... my thought is we do a bring your own food to bbq kind of thing.  

Do weekends work best for everyone?

EDIT: Leave a comment in this post and we'll send you a message when we have a more firm date.

EDIT 2: Looks like Global Meetup day would be the best day to do this.  That's June 25th

EDIT 3: The event has been added to redditgifts.com's meetup section! http://redditgifts.com/meetups/louisville-cookout-global-meetup-day/

EDIT 4: Looks like more and more people are saying Cherokee park since it is closer to the center of Louisville.  So hopefully this doesn't cause too much confusion

EDIT 5: A few people have made comments about where in Cherokee park to meet. It looks like the consensus is to meet at Hogan's Fountain...

First of all, and various other sites across the internet. A Google search yielded almost 600,000 results. The ban on ""personal information"" as I understand it, deals more with posting things and links to things that are not already widely available or commonly known. As I see it, it is the difference between posting a business' publicly listed phone number and posting the manager's unlisted cell phone number. I did not remove it for the sole purpose of hiding their names.

I did not remove it because there are other posts about the same topic. Three posts over the course of a week on a hot button issue is not uncommon or excessive, and no one even points out that all of this has been rehashed in the sidebar as well. My point is that multiple posts on similar topics isn't always a bad thing. If we're going to quote the redditquette, we should notice that the redditquette also says: ""Don't complain about too many stories or images on a particular topic.""

Now that I have outlined why it was not removed, and that is how that post read to me, so I removed it. The intent of the post was clearly to call these two out and challenge the community to take an action. That is not what we are here for. Posts on Urban Outfitters vs. Highland Coffee by me never called for any action from anyone. I didn't even participate in the discussion because I did not want to incite any action with my opinions. Posts about Grasshoppers CSA do not encourage others not to buy from them. They merely point out that user's experience and/or opinion. This post about the ""rapists"" crossed the line between ""call to attention"" and ""call to action"". That is why it was removed.

Thank you for contacting me to express your concerns about H.R. 3261

 

As you know, and product sales on the Internet. While I certainly support the goal of protecting intellectual property and preventing the trafficking of counterfeit goods, I share your concerns that H.R. 3261 is an overly-broad tool that may result in the removal of non-infringing content from the Internet, in contravention of the First Amendment.

 

H.R. 3261 is currently pending consideration in the House Judiciary Committee, you may be assured that I will keep your views close in mind should SOPA or another bill on this matter come to the House Floor for a vote.

Coming back every night from UPS from 4:30-7 it wasn't uncommon for me to be followed home by a cop every night.  Never stopped me

Anyways, a second car parks behind me.  Lights shining, 4 cops step out.  As the officer approaches my car, and I'm putting my window down, before I even get it down he tells me I smell like alcohol.  Asks if I've been drinking.  Two cops stay behind and talk to me while he checks my license and registration.  I figure I did okay during their verbal test so they didn't bother taking out the breathalyzer.  I've been pulled over a total of **THREE** times for the same shit.  Same questions, same 'alcohol' smell.  They admitted having no reason to pull me over, but that they can pull anyone over for no reason because of a ""New Albany Police Traffic Initiative"".  In other words

The real reason I'm writing this is because of what happened tonight.  My fiance was took my son to pick up a prescription.  He has been getting over pneumonia.  She was pulled over for no reason, no ticket, but she was upset about it.

What are /r/Louisville's thoughts on this?

&gt; I have a story your news team may be interested in...I emailed this to Eric Flack of Wave 3 but I am sharing it with all news stations..

&gt; I am writing to see if you're interested in covering a story involving a well-known Louisville restaurant and the truth behind the facade...
&gt; Yesterday I was terminated from Lynn's Paradise Cafe for not being able to bring in $100 cash for my shift. It is a new policy that started 1/2/13, my manager who terminated me claimed that we were already required to bring in $50 cash everyday, which is untrue and was never a policy that was implemented in the 11 months that I was employed there, nor is it even in the employee handbook...I think that is something very important I would have remembered, don't you?! Also, had this been true, I would have been terminated a long time ago

&gt; It's especially heartbreaking to me because I am also expecting another child, I called our main manager, Patty Schnatter to see if we would work something out to where I could change positions to be a hostess seeing as I could not afford to be part of the new policy taking place. She denied me any leeway and said I was terminated for ""breaking policy rule"". No warnings, no second chances, just terminated then and there, over the phone.

&gt; Now, this is the worst of the worst. Lynn and Patty were already known for firing their employees for little to no reason, but this ones really takes the cake.

&gt; I also have some information on other wrong-doings of theirs, I think that this would really cause a ruckus in our city. Luckily, it's all true and fact based and myself and others would be more than happy to divulge their dirty little secrets. Or even just this new policy that has resulted in a pregnant woman (myself!) being terminated, essentially for being poor. Not only was it humiliating for me but also has left me little hope for humanity at all.

&gt; Please help me bring this situation in the light and possibly get some kind of answers as to why this is happening...from what Patty said, dedicated staff. For the record, no one signed anything regarding this new policy. There were memos placed around the restaurant for two weeks before it took place and yes, we were allowed to talk to management about it, but no one would because of fear of losing their job. I am walking proof of losing my job because I questioned the new policy and could not adhere to it.
Please

I reached out to /r/assistance about the same situation, actually. So I come here, since this is a subreddit dedicated to the city I live in.

All I'm looking for is a roof for a few weeks. I have to get some money together to get my birth certificate

I understand that it's a lot to ask; I'm some random guy on the internet. And I'm the reason why I'm in this situation. But it didn't go the way I planned it to

I should also give some context: Lost my well paying job due to severe depression and unhappiness with said job that was affecting my performance. I have not had luck finding suitable employment or a program to assist in paying rent before my landlord got fed up. 

I sold what little I had that I was able to sell to have basic necessities, only to find that I don't have a copy of my birth certificate and that it's going to cost money I don't have to have one mailed to me.

Today my wife's bike was stolen from in front of her work at 6th &amp; Jefferson. It was a black, flat handlebars. She has already filed a police report, and unfortunately the courthouse does not have outside security cameras. We will be checking Craigslist and the local classifieds(and even some of the outlying counties if possible). We realize the chances of us locating the bike and getting it back are pretty slim, but we want to try every outlet possible, as this was her main form of transportation, and also a very nice bike that she put a lot of time, money and care into. 

Hopefully posting this here does not violate any rules, I am looking forward to helping her save up for a cool, new bike, and a new lock made of adamantium.

P.S.

This is the only thing I still need to get rid of - it's my 100% converted to run on used cooking oil, so it's got another 200k before you even need to look at it. I've done a two tank conversion for straight veggie oil, with a heated tank, fuel line and injector line, and a new fuel pump. I've got 12k on veggie oil driving this truck myself, and it'll easily go on. Over the year I've had it I've also: 
Put four new tires on it (80% life remaining) 
New battery cable 
New rear cylinders and axle seals 
New brake master cylinder 
New bumper 
New flex lines and brake lines 
New fuel lines 
New fuel system 
Moved the selector valve up underneath the hood 
New injector return caps and lines

As far as body goes, maybe a little better. I bought it as a farm truck, and then used it mostly to get back and forth to school, so it was worked hard, but then I put 12k highway miles on it and it did fine. It's got a 5th wheel, and if you want I'll throw in the bumper I took off it, which is a big shock bumper made for hauling very heavy boats.  There's also a matching topper and bedliner. I'll include the grease collection pump, a filtering barrel and some filters

I went to the new bridge today for the first time and couldn't believe all of the waste left behind from the responsible pet owner's who do pick up their poop. I really mean that too. Even when you pick the poop up it still leaves a nasty residue behind that stains the concrete and can still get on your shoes. My friend was busy looking at the city as we were walking and stepped right in some! At another spot it looked like shit literally exploded out of this poor dog because it was everywhere (stretched all the way across the center bike lane) You could see where other dogs and people trampled straight through it and spread it even more. Other dogs yapping at people walking by. Dogs barking at each other. It's almost like some people are just trying to make some type of point by bring their many dog's up there. I would never take my animals on that bridge (end up with some disease). I just hope they ban animals really soon. It would be a lot better experience then!! Also I noticed people had their dogs on leashes (of course) but were constantly getting in the way of the bikers. Totally ruining the experience for them as well.,t5_2qqvg,True
1364509576.0,1b7ecz,Moving to Louisville from X.,veritas7882,33,5,23,"I frequently see posts in this subreddit from people moving to our city from out of state looking for information about the city.  Can we work together to come up with something full of information we can link them to each time one of these comes up for convenience and to make sure we're not leaving anything out?  Perhaps even something the mods can add to the ""Links to local information"" section.  There's already a ""Pro tips and visitor advice"" link so maybe we can expand that to include people that are relocating as well?

Edit:
Here's what I've compiled from the posts so far

You can't beat living in the Highlands. I've lived in about every part of this town at one point or another, friendly, 15mins from anywhere in the city.. It's the place to be. St. Matthews/East end of town are more your place if you're into the whole stuffy white suburb thing. There's nothing really here thats terrible that's not unavoidable. There are areas of town like Portland that I wouldn't recommend visiting unless you're into the whole poor white trash thing. Old Louisville, for college students especially, is an amazing community. Cheaper rent than the university housing, plus larger spaces! I live about 3 blocks north of campus and pay $500 a month for a huge 1BR with private parking, patio, Old Louisville is a great area for taking walks, parking

As far as social life goes, and other great kid friendly things. The Highlands is a great area for mommy and daddy to explore. A lot of local shops and bars in that area. Churchill Downs is an obvious point of interest. Names of some local landmarks worth at least knowing about include Waverly Hills Sanitarium, Cherokee Park, Waterfront Park, Iroquois Park, Muhammad Ali Center, Fraiser Art Museum, Kentucky Kingdom (closed down amusement park, frisbee, laser tag

Night life is super active. 4th St. Live is the place to get your dance on, but it can be fun with a group. St Matthews bars are a bit of a mixup. Drakes, restaurant by day, ""cougar club"" by night. One side dance club, other side very loud sit-down bar. Molly Malones (St. Matthews, there are a couple) is a good mix of music and conversation. Further down the street you have bars like Dark Star, which tend to be the friendly, chat-with-strangers drinking by day
Food, home grown fruits and veggies, and a lunch you can munch on for a day or two will run you about $4), and dinner at anything from one of a dozen amazing sushi places, to the few 4/5-star steakhouses, or anything in between. Louisville's surprisingly well-known for our food. We did invent the cheeseburger, after all.

EDIT 2: A majority of people seem to be interested in a bar (I personally think that Sergio's would be ideal for this but nothing's for sure) but I do want to include our under-21 redditors yet sadly have no ideas as to what we could do. Someone mentioned Incredible Dave's which I personally don't have any experience with.

**EDIT 3: Ok, and Bowling (I'm gonna throw Lazer Blaze in there). I think I'm going to plan it for sometime over the month of December as it seems a majority of the readers are in college. Sometime in the next few days I'll post a poll (where to go, roughly when to have it etc) on what everyone wants to do and we will go from there.**

**If anyone has anything to add please feel free to comment here and/or message me.

It would seem that the owners of Holiday World have achieved these objectives.

Regarding the Fair Board,000 jobs and other economic benefits associated with an open and vibrant Kentucky Kingdom.

List your favorite school in Louisville. Tell us about it. Why did you go there? What did you study? How much did you spend? Did it pay off? What were the professors like? Any details you feel like sharing.

**Some Guidelines:**

* I'd like to keep this thread about schools beyond high school. K-12 might be interesting fodder

* Any school in the MSA is listable. This includes southern IN and some surrounding areas. Public, non profit, whatever.

* Please list editorials about schools. Good, etc. 

* Please list as many details as you can. For example:  
**Spalding University, http://www.spalding.edu, Bachelors, Masters, PhD, Evening/Weekend classes, tuition and fees vary by program $390-850/credit hour.**

* Lets be civil though. If you don't like a school that someone else has listed, or even just people that are curious.

This year we are hosting a N64 Super Smash Bros tournament in February. I am starting early to get some things set in stone and was wondering if any one had a charity that is dear to their heart. If there is any post for a reputable charity that has a lot of people who believe it to be good

Also, and the 2nd who has said they will pay for the venue as well as equipment rental fees. If you would like to help sponsor it, please contact me through here or lplouisville@edrtrust.com.

My dream company (which is obviously in Louisville) just posted an open position in my field. I'm absolutely stoked about it and I'll be applying tonight. I know, now that I meet their experience qualifications, I'll be applying until I get it.

I want to know more about Louisville! I've read the wikipedia entry. I've read the visitors guide and the ""ins and outs"" posted here. I want to know more so if I'm asked in an interview ""what attracts you to Louisville"" I'm prepared.

I'm 28, parks, good relaxed bars when we can find a babysitter, astronomy, etc. What is available in these areas? My wife stays at home with our son, are there good communities for SAHP's?

We currently live in South Florida (making less money than the company in Louisville pays) paying $1250/mo for a 2 bedroom. What is the average for a 2 bedroom there? Is it possible to rent in a rural area with some useable land (we like to garden) and still live within 30 minutes of downtown? How bike friendly is the city if we decide to live in the city and I commute to work?

What is your favorite thing about living in Louisville?

I wanted to explain my absense to you all and kinda let you in on what has been going on. 

Many of you will know me

I have been away for about 2 and half months. My family had been riddled with issues and I thought it ok to step back for a time thinking theMrautomatic was here and was our fellow moderator. Needless to say he disappeared and you can't even bring the page up anymore. 

I am very sorry about this. I never meant to leave the subreddit unmanned and I appologize to any of you who had submissions go into the spam filter and never be fixed or ask us questions and never had them answered. It will not happen agian.

As we have grown from a /r with only 76 members when I took over to 2 members away from only 1000( Im sure atleast 2 of you have alts that could join )  I have realised with whothefucksaidthat's help that we need more staffing. 
 
i hope all of you are doing well and that our little space on the internet can continue to grow and be benefecial to all of us. any questions comments or concerns is welcome at any time. 

Cheers!
