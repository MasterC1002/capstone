1369739558.0,1f6yl8,PSA: You are probably not using your sentinel correctly.,Arsonide,421,50,70,"This is a PSA/Guide regarding sentinel AI. It applies mostly to Dethcube for reasons I will explain

I noticed that my Dethcube was shooting at things until they died, which is a great skill. The only time it vaporized anything was in the millisecond time span between shooting things - even if things were meleeing my face. I thought it was stupid, and that it should vaporize the minute anything gets within five feet of me, and shoot when it has nothing better to do. That's when I learned something.

The sentinels have a priority list of which skills they use at what times. This is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT and not very apparent in the UI. Essentially, it gets HIGHEST PRIORITY, meaning things like saving your life with Guardian are only done when it's not shooting something. Shooting is more important. On Dethcube this is particularly bad, because it's gun never stops firing while something is in range, while the others stop occasionally.

I made an image to illustrate this point more clearly: http://content.screencast.com/users/Arsonide/folders/Jing/media/2736dcd4-d1a7-48ca-b09c-6d97e3f65df7/2013-05-28_0558.png

You will notice in my image, because it is the sentinel's active skill. Then Regen, though I imagine this could also be last, since the sentinel isn't firing when it is dead. Lastly, I put the attack AI card. My sentinel now vaporizes the second anything gets near me, and only attacks while vaporize is on cooldown. I also expect I'll be getting more shield refills from now on.

TLDR: Sentinels have a priority queue. Do not put your attack AI card in the top left corner,False,self,t5_2urg0,1369742087.0,,,t3_1f6yl8

First, Fusion Moas, Grineer Troopers, and Grineer Heavy Gunners are the familiar faces in the tower. [A standard Corpus Crewman](http://i.imgur.com/ZzOEAMj.jpg)

The levels of enemies vary from tier to tier.

TIER I has enemies ranging in level from ~15-~25 with enemies typically around 20

TIER II has enemies ranging in level from ~25-~45 with enemies typically around 35

TIER III has enemies ranging in level from ~50-~85 (Some as high as 100 have been spotted though) with enemies typically around 75

You'll also see reskins of the shield ospreys in the towers, more accurate weapons. [A stop fucking moving you little shithead in action](http://i.imgur.com/7Ul7cdw.jpg)

Besides the shoot bangs you see, and Laser Panels. Turrets function like their Corpus counterparts, except that they might pop out of bushes or out of the ground when you step on a pressure plate. Death Orbs are big round balls (duh) that will open any number of their side panels and shoot lasers at you. In addition, they can also work like shockwave moas and periodically do a groundpound. By shooting the top panel on an orb, you can stop it from moving. If you're extra pissed, you can shoot off any side panel shooting a beam to reveal a glowing vortex inside. Shoot the vortex to create a devastating explosion. Walking near an orb as a Prime Frame will replenish a large amount of energy for the entire team. [A dormant Laser Orb](http://i.imgur.com/lV7gJNZ.jpg). Laser panels are identical to the panels on laser orbs, except they move on little tracks. They can be shot off in the same way as the orbs can.

More importantly than the enemies are the treasures. Mods can and will drop from regular containers and lockers. Some containers may explode

Treasures aren't always there in the open though. The Orokin are going to make you work for your money by hiding them in various rooms. I could go into detail about all the secret passages and shortcuts hidden throughout the levels

Pressure plates are scattered all over the tower. Some are in plain sight, the plates will open a nearby wall or floor panel with some lockers or containers inside, so keep your eye out when you step on them.

There are five major puzzle rooms I've found so far in my ~30 runs.

**THE FILIGREE ROOM**

 /u/Noneerror provided screenshots and a description.

&gt;There's also a big open area wall run room. You have to jump up on the filigree

This room is marked by the large gazebo in the center of the room. Getting on top of the gazebo will allow you to spot the landing with the goodies. [Here is another screenshot by /u/Noneerror](http://postimg.org/image/otw61fvpd/)

I have gotten up there by jumping and wall running off the pillars on the middle level balcony to grab onto the gazebo roof side. This can be done by all frames, wall run where it was shown.

**THE WATERFALL ROOM**

This is a very small puzzle room (in terms of complexity)

This room is very large and ornate with multiple waterfalls and pathways surrounding a raised dais in the center. [A picture of the room](http://i.imgur.com/aqGHANb.jpg).Around the central tree are four pressure plates. Pressing one of them may lead to a door opening above an upward flowing waterfall [shown here](http://i.imgur.com/blzaL2H.jpg). Jump into the waterfall while running forward to gain a bit of height. This height will allow you to wall run up the opposing wall. At the top is a small room with a few lockers and containers, so this may be the end of the run. (After more runs I've noticed that the room that opens first may be switched. Pressing the plate inside will open the other.) /u/MrJelle notes that the upper four panels may not work. If this is the case, a lower room will usually start out opened.

**THE CLIMB**

(I added this room after getting three mod drops from it.  It has no timer or puzzle which is why I omitted it originally)

[Here is a picture of The Climb](http://i.imgur.com/JwmANeA.jpg)

Screenshot belongs to /u/Steyrboy and I took it from his post. 

This room is a large open tower with a floor covered in water, albeit tricky. Much simpler is to simply walk across the water floor (it's shallow) and make your way to an alcove on the opposite end. A raising wall is here, so activate it, jump on it, then wall run with the added height up the opposing wall. From here you can easily make your way across the platforms to either side of the room which can have anywhere from 0-8 crates.

**THE RUN**

(Occasionally this room will be there

This room is pretty straightforward. A pressure plate opens a small gate for you

Along the side of the run are two balconies that can also be used to bypass the lasers and cryo floors (Credit to /u/shiny_dunsparce for this tip)

**THE PUZZLE ROOM**


This room has no timer
). If the color is blue [as shown here](http://i.imgur.com/ivPnfwh.jpg)

 [A picture of the puzzle room. Note the tree.](http://i.imgur.com/IffzL2l.jpg)

**THE PARKOUR ROOM**

(This room rarely spawns in extermination missions. I've also heard of multiple rooms spawning per run

[This is the entrance plate. Be sure to have the whole team with you or else pressing the following plate will lock them out.](http://i.imgur.com/j9yiVtG.jpg)

By far the most difficult and notorious room so far. Upon entering the starting room, avoid the few lasers beyond that, jump the cryo floors, and then you have a very large treasure room ripe for looting. [The treasure room is just above!](http://i.imgur.com/63wvLac.jpg)

Some shortcuts are available in this room: 

-The waterfall in the center of one of the rooms is flowing upwards. Slide jump into it to gain some distance. ""raddude"" discovered that a secret ledge is above the water. Use this to get some more goodies [The ""water-rise""](http://i.imgur.com/IFNWeL2.jpg)

-Side paths with laser traps are available and must be taken on the return trip

-The final laser room can be circumvented by taking the upper path on the side. This is a FAR slower process and is usually too slow to succeed. 

-The laser panels on the floor can be destroyed like normal

That's every thing I've discovered in the tower worth noting (besides various shortcuts, major points, or pictures please comment so I can add them here (with credit of course).

Don't rush the runs

A month or two back, and I do frequently experience crashes that could be linked to hardware failures. It also seemed dumb, for the lack of a better word, that their system would be triggered by these things. On the other hand, it must be effective at catching real cheaters if they are still using it, so I didn't mind being banned, especially given the short response time.

Today, I was banned **again**. I was pretty frustrated, but I knew it was just another false positive and hoped DE_Glen would be on to save my day. Indeed he was on, but this time he was not here to save me. Instead, he simply said that this time it was not a false positive, that I violated their EULA and I would not be allowed any more appeals, i.e. the ban was final and he would not even say what for. I replied back and asked if he could elaborate and recheck their systems. He replied back quickly, and quoted one sentence from their Terms of Use:

&gt;Please note that regardless of any notice

(This type of statement shows up in most Terms of Uses

The conversation pretty much ended there. Now of course I haven't done anything wrong

Now I don't expect anyone to up and quit Warframe (there's no reason to), it does.

-Tapping space during a cinematic (beginning of missions and bosses) will prompt you with a skip cinematic interface 

-The number displayed everytime a kill occurs is experience

-When fusing mods

-A great planet to farm experience solo (or even in group) is Venus - Fossa. Not only do the moas give you good experience (Around 260 per kill) but you then kill Jackal for additional experience. Here's a link to my short guide : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbxX7Q4uKfk

-Red orbs give you +25 health back

-Press ""Q"" to open your inventory and have access to the items you put in there

-You can switch position with your Decoy using your teleportation ability (jefrejtor)

-Charge damage IS NOT increased by the Melee Damage mod

-Half of the squad must reach the end for the countdown to tick

-Blueprints look like white affinity orbs with a pink color instead.

-Doing a slide attack (Sprint+Crouch+Attack) will allow you to go through lasers

-Press ""Z"" to see your party members 

-Some abilities will also allow you to go through lasers

-Your warframe

-Your profile level allows you to unlock weapons that can then be bought

-Crit chance mods will not grant you as much crit chance as it is written

 -Armor penetration will allow you to deal damage to enemies in areas they cannot normally be damaged and/or deal extra damage. For exemple corpus crewman will take severe damage when shot to the head with armor penetration mods

-Ancient infecteds have weakspots in their arms and legs ! (confuseray)

-Holding shift and clicking multiple mods will select them all 

-Grineer Seekers will drop down rolling grenades that will stick to you

-Lasers and turrets are activated by cameras on Corpus maps. If any player is seen on any camera all the lasers on the map will activate. (azkabaal)

-Tapping shift to roll as an ancient is about to hit you will prevent you getting knocked down. You can also block them.

-Pressing ""H"" will switch your camera position

1369656887.0,1f4tqh,Dethcube and why he should not be nerfed.,lamentz25,156,29,48,"Ok

Now, what I hope that DE realizes, is that a PvE driven game does not need nerfs if it is feasible to buff everything else to that level.

Let's think about it for a second. In LoL for example, it receives a nerf. In such a way, imbalance is not necessarily a bad thing. Just like the Dread bow can score incredibly high crits against infested, but it is pretty weak when used against either of the other two factions (no armor ignore). The weapon might be considered overpowered against the infested, but its uselessness against the other factions makes that ok, because it still promotes using different weapons for different purposes.

Now take Ironskin (I'm not going to say whether it is in a good place right now or not because that's not what this post is about). Originally, because there is nothing that can overcome its power.

Ok, not even Dethcube. Just because he is better than the other two right now doesn't mean that he should be targeted for a nerf like an overpowered ability should.

Right now, and he is absolutely adorable (ok, that might not be a balance issue, but still, look at that twitchy little guy).

Wyrm on the other hand is not very useful. His damage is laughable unless he has the absolute best mods available to him

Shade is good, and before Dethcube, he was top of the pack in terms of popularity.

Now, the other two should be buffed to match Dethcube. I'm not talking flat damage, I think that Dethcube has that covered. Here are my proposed methods of making Wyrm and Shade more appealing without making Dethcube obsolete.

Wyrm:

 * Fix his stun ability already... seriously... this is just silly.
 * Give him another ability that acts like Rhino's current Ironskin. Make him taunt all enemies to attack him
 * The new Wyrm is a support tank. He can stun enemies for you to make short work of, but for his utility.

Shade:

 * Make his stealth last until after the first melee hit
 * Have him use an ability similar to Banshee's sonar
 * The new Shade is a pure support. He can make you invisible

Dethcube:

 * Right now
 * Give Dethcube a damage/attack speed steroid. This would be a random burst of damage. Nothing huge

Those are my thoughts and ideas on the situation

Edit: I accidentally a word.

I'd love to see more events in the game that are truly dangerous to the players.  Things that you might actually have to run from rather than blazing a trail through.

The Stalker is already one of these - it's genuinely dangerous and can kill you when it's after you.  A full team of four won't have much trouble with it

Here's a couple more ideas:

1.  Hyena packs.  The fluff dialogue when approaching Hyena indicates that these are 'causing trouble for Tenno in the field' and they 'hunt in packs'.  Now they do.  Anywhere from 4 to 10 of these can spawn in any Corpus mission and come after you.  Rare

2.  Ship self destruct.  The captain realizes the ship is lost and sets it to self destruct.  Exit before the timer ends or it's curtains for you.  Happens after completing the objective.

3.  Ship vented.  You know when you break the space glass and you start losing oxygen?  The ship captain wants to kill you and does this

4.  Phoroid attack.  Once in awhile an Infested just plain grows up mean.  Appears in infested missions anytime.

5.  Laser lockdown.  The Corpus realize you're on their ship and set the laser doors and turrets to be permanently on.  They no longer knock you back

6.  Enemy Horde.  An unusual amount of troops / infested are on this ship.  Constant waves of enemies start relentlessly attacking you

7.  The Ancient Golem.  An infested disruptor that *cannot be killed* starts coming after you.  He can be 'dropped' by killing him

8.  Stalker packs.  When one didn't do the job

9.  Hard Lock - happens when you get locked down in a room and someone destroys the hacking console (make consoles destructible).  Lotus will start working on a hack of her own, bombards, infernos for a Grineer attack, for instance).

10.  EMP blast.  The ship lets out a pulse that disables all shields and removes all warframe energy,False,self,t5_2urg0,False,,excalibur-prime,t3_1hg3r0

- Capture missions (any)

- Defense missions (any) - depends on wave level

The way defense missions work is that rewards are based on mobs' level in 5/10/15/... waves.
Depending on level it assigns it a tier. I don't know what the thresholds are at the moment.  

Below is a list of all the rewards you can get depending on mission type. Note that capture

The reason so many people are purchasing Vauban and you're seeing him practically everywhere is because he's friggin fun to use (and send friends into orbit with). 

With many being 'one trick ponies', Saryn's malt, Frost's snowglobe and Ash's smoke screen (debatable). While the others just feel lackluster, straight utility, or less capable late game.

What would you guys feel about changing up some of the frames abilities to make them unique and interesting?

A suggestion of mine would be to have unique passives across all the frames

- Rhino cannot be knocked down

- Saryn, and are not effecting by their status effects (Volt can't be stunned by electricity, Saryn can't be poisoned, Ember can't be set on fire)

- Loki has a permanent shade effect: proximity cloak (not too sure about this one

- Enemies are less likely (10-15%) to target Nyx 

- Ash has a higher base crit chance on all weapons, i believe this can be countered by lowering his hp/sheilds/armor
to make him respectively an assassin)

- Excalibur has higher base melee damage that scales with level

- Trinity's health regenerates at a slightly higher rate than the health regen artifact (name of it escapes me right now) 

- Frost doesn't lose shields on ice levels

- Mag's bullets slightly curve toward targets (would be devastating with something like the gorgon or grakata)

- I'm not too sure about banshee but i've mostly seen her with snipers so perhaps the further away from a target she is the more damage she does (think like 3% per 60 meters

_______

**-Introduction and Explanation-**


In the past, so that they truly develop their own personality. **I believe that this is a great philosophy and I adamantly agree with this design decision.** If DE chooses to continue to follow this way of thinking, I'm sure in the near future that each player will eventually come to love each individual WF. Many currently successful games follow this design; TF2 and League of Legends come to mind. Players come to love a specific character or champion, and soon inside jokes and the like begin to grow, which are important in creating a closer community. In LoL, Riot has perfected the art of making new champions feel special; they flesh out the background, and make each champion look unique and have their own personalities. This is much harder to replicate in Warframe, are unique passives. While some champions share very similar passives, in many champions

For example, and are known to be weak in the beginning, but if you carry them, they will carry you later. Although the two champions take the same roles, in lane they play quite differently. Graves' passive, True Grit, rewards him for being in battle by giving him more Armor and Magic resist, Headshot, and in turn create truly unique champions. 


**I highly recommend that DE take a look into creating unique passives for each Warframe.**

___

**-Ideas For Unique Passives-**


Although the skillsets of each individual warframe already do a great deal of work to make the gameplay and strategy of each WF to feel different, I don't really care about which WF I'm using, all I really need to care about is my aim. DE needs to fix this.** By implementing unique passives, you can completely change how each WF plays.

Here are a few examples of passives I came up with; please bear in mind that I am aware some of these are basic
___
**Ember**

Unique Passive: Rising Flame/Overheat/Pyromaniac. When the Ember uses an ability, the Ember gains 50% less energy from all sources.

Current Playstyle: Right now

What does this change: Now the Ember is rewarded for using its skills, in order to balance the mechanism. The energy gain reduction will prevent Embers from abusing its passive.

___
**Ash**

Unique Passive: Bloodthirst. When the Ash is stealthed, it is rewarded with a stack that reduces the energy cost of his next ability by 2 energy. When the Ash uses an ability, or waits 30 seconds, he loses all stacks.

Current Playstyle: Ash can be played as a stealth WF, where, its much much tankier than Loki, but has reduced stealth potential and less utility, and its just not as tanky as Rhino and doesn't contribute to the team as much.

What does this change: Now Ash's are rewarded for going stealth

___
**Saryn**

Unique Passive: Corrosive Acid. Enemies damaged by Saryn's abilties

Current Playstyle: I think that the Saryn is actually in a very good place right now and has one of the best and balanced skill sets. She excels at both single target DPS as well as AoE damage. All she really needs is to be able to help the team as a whole.

What does this change: Now the Saryn is a much more valuable member of a team, she feels much more like an Acid Queen.

___

**Mag - suggested by tharinock**

Unique Passive: Magnetic Charge. Whenever Mag uses an ability

Current Playstyle: Mag is a support caster type character. Her biggest issue is that each of her abilities either is only occasionally useful or tends to fall off later in the game.

How does this change Mag: Mag will now be invaluable for keeping things alive. The shield recharge is hard to hit on an ally, it will make crush useful when defending the cryopod against a swarm of ancients, since you can cc the ancients and recharge some shields in one go.

___

**Loki**

Unique Passive: Deception. For every enemy killed while stealthed, an invincible clone is placed nearby for 15 seconds. "" -Sc4r4byte

Current Playstyle: Loki is a high skill level warframe

What does this change: I think that Loki players should be rewarded for the high skill and risk gameplay. This passive will reward Loki's for playing stealth and allowing them to go on rampages. A good Loki will be able to clear entire rooms if he's good enough.

Banshee Helmet Blueprint: 3.16%  
Banshee Chassis Blueprint: 0.15%  
Banshee Systems Blueprint: 3.16%  
Orokin Tier 3 Extermination Key: 0.15%  

The order of these items is important in a way. When you enter a defense mission (let's assume high level so you start at Tier 3)
After completing 5th wave
1. Create an interval between 0 and 1 consisting of all the possible rewards (notice the sum of % is 1)  
    * In this case, etc.  
2. Now find out where your initial seed fits in

On the next checkpoint (this case 10th wave) depending on the seed you'll get a new random number. This new random number will be added to the initial seed. That is if your initial seed was 0.5

With this knowledge and the loot table

Example:  
* You start a defense mission.  
* At wave 5 you get Heated Charge. Now you know your initial seed was between 0.1897 and 0.3794.  
* At wave 10 you get Heated Charge again. Now you know your increment was approximately (between 0 and 0.1896 or between 0.8104 and 1).  
* Since orokin tier 3 key is the last in the table
* If your increment is big the chance to hit 0.985 - 1.0 interval is really small.  

Example sequence:
&gt; 0.93  
0.14  
0.35  
0.55  
0.76  
0.96  
0.17  
0.38  
0.58  
0.79  
(rounded)

I hope this explained why you might be getting the same reward multiple times and why low % rewards are so rare. This should also explain why defense rewards don't scale with levels.

I was done 80% reloading, but I was running down stairs and the game decided it is a fall and I should roll and now I have start my 2 second reload from the start.

1. I want the mission type (Assassination/Raid/Sabotage) always on one corner of my screen. It is easy to forget what was my objective.

1. Minor point: When I break a container dont make the drops jump 5 miles away. They often drop into the abyss

1. This is a separate discussion, it is not fun, it is annoying to the point of giving me a headache. Screen shake due to an enemy to throw your aim off is kinda fine though annoying. Screen shake due to an ally spamming fragor (sometimes from 3 rooms away) is *infuriating*. If I wanted a bunch of people to stop playing Warframe, I will join their game and spam hammer melee. Why should I be penalized for a teammates actions anyways ?

1365623392.0,1c31ik,For those who want a TL:DR of the stream,EzronKun,103,16,105,"Here is a list of thing that have been shown/proven true/ confirmed

**Weapons!**
New Melee weapons - Ether swords, possible Ether duel dagger

New gun: Duel Viper

Throw-able weapons

Confirmed for future: Laser weapons!

**For warframes!**

New frames in the works

Ability changes for ASH number 1 with the implementation of throw-able weapons

Confirmed


**MODS!**

Rarity above Rare has been confirmed

Confirmed knock back mods

**STAGES!**

New tile sets (around 6-11 I believe?) for Corpus asteroid base missions.

New tile sets for Corpus outside world missions.

Confirmed that new music is in the works or shall soon be under way.

**GENDERS!**

They hinted at this

**PvP!**

Confirmed that they still are not working on PvP at this time.

**New bosses

New bosses in the works

They hinted at possible new hidden fun stuff like the Stalker

Confirmed new factions
****
**LORE?!**

Animator Designer Geoff is in the works of a new trailer for the game

**CLANS!**

Confirmed pooling of resources for clans. 

Confirmed Gifting (seems to be only Platinum gifting atm)

Confirmed Clan leaderboards and list of existing clans

Confirmed that clans shall be able to create their own dojo's that will take resources, and tile sets straight from the missions we go on. You shall be able to invite friends outside of the clan, into the dojo if you wish

Possible Clan quests/missions

Confirmed Clan vs Clan! (Not PvP). It seems that it will have a RISK type gameplay


**PETS!**

New pets have been confirmed

New pet skills

New pet customization! (make em look pretty or something)



EDIT: Stuff I forgot to mention

**RESETS!
**
We will not be getting resets this upcoming update 8. But they did explain what the reset will entail. Pretty much you litterally lose everything. All frames will be taken away minus w.e starter you choose. All weapons minus the Vandels (Lato vandel and Braton Vandel) will be taken, one time thing, so if you decide to do it, but afterwards, you want to go back to how you were, you are screwed, due to the data either being completely gone

Also

Finally, most likely containing the Ether weapons, and Duel vipers, with some probable fixes.

Oh, changes to Global chat to make font better, and looking at player names on the chat bar side easier/better.


OH! almost forgot again

Confirmed new game mode, in order to stop assholes who simply run through, leaving lower leveled players/ people going slow behind, they have made it so that you cannot start the mission complete count down until at least half the team is at the extraction point. They also plan on some changes for when people DC after they have beaten a boss in order to stop the host migrations and stop people from losing their items.


EDIT 2: Crap

They talked about being able to prestige (like in call of duty) with weapons, enabling for even more/better mods!



EDIT 3: DAMNIT! I keep forgetting important things &gt;_&gt;

Just remembered

**STEALTH SYSTEM!** 

They had talk about soon making the stealth system much better when many other things are finally done. One such change that we can expect (not with update 8 though) is that one day, if you stay hidden long enough and such.

Also, and that it can be pretty buggy, so having to be forced to progress on those types of levels will bring endless frustration

Personally I'd like to see it reworked or removed all together.
Best of all was if it were optional

Perhaps a vote that the players can decide if to continue or to head for the exit.

It's a small change that, the last thing I want to hear is ""This just got interesting.. "". By making it an optional feature the players them self could opt to head straight for the exit or take the longer path for added reward. 

Also from a RP perspective it would make more sense for the Lotus to prioritise the main objective, make the old one a optional secondary.

While I'm not crazy about it either, and strength of mods could change throughout the beta.

So that isn't my complaint about the new system. Here *is* my complaint:

**The new aura system with polarities in place

For example, I *have to* have Energy Siphon equipped. So that means I'll need to forma my Frost so that he has the Energy Siphon polarity for his aura slot. But now, from a functional standpoint, that means that I can *only* run with auras that have the same polarity as Energy Siphon. I don't know the breakdown on the aura polarities, but this cuts down my viable options by 2/3 to 3/4. 

So after I've forma'd my aura slot

Hopefully they get this straitened away. One of the great things about this game is having so many options available. Though the artifact system definitely needed work

1366666017.0,1cw20h,[STEALTH BRAINSTORM] It needs work. A lot of work.,Subhazard,95,16,57,"Currently

It's lacking in a lot of areas, and rewarding. I mean come on, we're space ninjas. We should be stealthy.


MOTIVATION:

If we're talking pure numbers, and you take longer with the mission. The solution would be to award the player more affinity for killing unaware targets, and even more affinity for stealth take-downs. Enough to compensate and even surpass a player who is going all out.  A stealth kill should award you 300% affinity, and a stealth-takedown should get you 400% affinity.

ALARMS:

The alarm system needs work.  All it takes is for a grineer or corpus to brush an alarm button with his arm hairs to send the entire ship on alert. Sure that's 'realistic' but we're playing a game here. It should take a full 5 seconds for an enemy to trigger an alarm

You should also be able to disable alarms or shoot alarms TO disable them

ALERT:

If an enemy sees me, and I lined up a shot on a buzzsaw grineer. He went 'huh?' a half second before the arrow hit him in the face. A few seconds later, an entire platoon came rushing in ready to fight from a room waaaaay down the hall.

This is how I think it should go:   ""On Sight"" Alert:  Radius of 5 meters.  Gunfire Alert: Within audible radius.

Hell

TAKEDOWNS:

Takedowns that dont kill an enemy should knock them down without giving out an alert, should be able to line up to attack a vital organ no problem. That's the entire point of stealth, to attack on your own terms.

REACTION TIMES:

Need to be lowered

We're playing space ninjas

LEVEL DESIGN:

Levels need to be designed with stealth in mind, open levels are almost an obvious design choice.  People really seem to like the defense levels and the new ice levels.  We could use more levels that have hallways that still connect to the same room, rather then just one long hallway with a few random branches leading to storage lockers.  It would also help if the waypoint was simply a direction, and the hallways weren't dead ends. We'd have an idea as to where to go, and multiple choices on how to get there.  The 'hold my hand' waypoint system really limits how much fun you can have with this game.

SENTINELS:

The shade's Ghost feature is great, and you can't directly control where they hover. When you crouch, they need to hover lower to the ground. Much lower.

The prime example of this is, if that information was accessible and clearly displayed to the player. The problem is, you have to consult the wiki or google docs weapon sheet to find these numbers. 

The same problem comes into play with mods like Continuity

What this creates is an environment in which players actively think they are coming up with cool builds to fit the style they want to play with. Maybe someone wants to have a Tesla army that last forever and turn the game into a tower defense game, in fact, decaying after the base duration. 

Solution: When in the Arsenal swapping out mods, continuity, etc.) will highlight all abilities affected by this card in a **RED** outline.

1372610222.0,1hdcuw,[Suggestion] Warframe Ability Specialization,Alzos,82,7,16,"Suggestion: Have the choice to specialize a Warframe's abilities, have maybe 2 or 3 options to choose from to make a modification to a Warframe's ability that might suit your gameplay

Examples:

**Slash Dash:**
 
*Specialization #1*: Choose change damage to an elemental type; i.e. AP, Electrical.

*Specialization #2*: Throws out an energy blade in a direction at the end of the Slash Dash (probably going the same direction you were

*Specialization #3*: You gain bonus melee damage for several seconds after you preform Slash Dash



**Sound Quake:**

*Specialization #1*: Gains Innate Armor Ignore or Armor Piercing (not sure which would be more preferred)

*Specialization #2*: Extend the radius of the stun effect

*Specialization #3*: Pick a dubstep track to play for the duration of the Sound Quake! (Ok, and this would still be awesome haha)



**Decoy:**

*Specialization #1*: Decoy explodes after duration expires

*Specialization #2*: Decoy gains the secondary the real Loki frame has

*Specializatoin #3*: Decoy will also make a fake of another random teammate. (Not sure about this one. Just throwing a 3rd one in there.)


So there are a couple examples. I don't want to make this post too large with examples. There's a lot that could be altered with this idea; maybe specialization only for ults

I just wanted to gauge the populous of the Warframe Subreddit on the idea. I think it might be nice because it would justify having multiples of the same frame ability as you could have 2 or 3 maxed mods for each ability, etc.

Let me know what you guys think

Well, while the game checks your team size.

Then your objective is simple. The objective isn't here, then beeline it (timer) to the extraction room. Rather than a destructible object, there's area or two that, if enemies are in it, a progress bar fills. It empties slowly if there are none. If it fills, fission mailed.

But...

**If you have a team of four**

The mission is different. The objective *is* here, you now have two different objective markers. And you need to split up and do them at the same time. Everybody on defense, the objective escapes. Everybody on objective, the ride gets shot down. The faster the objective team progresses, the harder a fight the defenders have on their hands, as the waves spawn faster.

I'm talking about the fast moving

Slide dash only works if they're like right in front of you on a flat surface. Many times you'll slide dash at them up a stairway or a hill and they'll completely ignore damage.

They will sometimes completely ignore radial javelins. Sometimes being about half the time.  Or it could be all the time

I only have Excal so I've only used those abilities against them.


Here are some changes that I think would make them less frustrating

* Make their health very small so that they're much easier to deal with.

* Make them controlled by Seekers. If you kill the Seeker

* Slow them way down. They should only speed up when they're lined up for an attack. Or have them spin out when they miss an attack

* Don't make them part of the initial patrolling enemies. This ruins any possibility of stealth gameplay right off the bat. (This should happen regardless of other balance changes)

&gt; Maybe if they ""burn out"" on their own? Say, they self destruct?

&gt;How about we get rid of the Latchers and the Rollerballs and combine them into one thing.  A large ball that jumps at you, and the knockback can get you into trouble and push you out of cover. ^/u/Subhazard

&gt; if you were able to slow them down with a freeze mod, I think that would make people a lot more happier than just getting rid of them in general. ^/u/K3ro6430

We invade these ships all the time and I think there's even more potential DE can get out of them.

I think it would be cool to see missions set on the hulls of the ships themselves, surrounded black-hawk down style on the hull.

This, here's a few ideas I had:

* New environmental hazard: asteroid belt/meteor shower

* Presuming artificial gravity or even magnetized Warframe feet there's some pretty cool level design potential

* There is so much potential for awesome visuals, passing meteors and comets, maybe even a Grineer armada engaging the corpus fleet. Those huge cannons from the galleon tile set firing away around you as you battle through external defense turrets and any of the mobs that could presumably survive in space.

* New enemy potential is also a big area, bigger bosses like huge ship-defence drones or even mech-like Grineer units meant to repel any boarding attempts.

* Mission types could be spiced up and even added to, taking out weapons from the outside, even blowing a huge hull breach in the ships hull where the barracks is located and watching all the unprepared Grineer or Corpus get sucked out into the void of space.

The potential for a tile set like this is huge and I feel it fits with the Tenno's role of subterfuge and stealth, please do post any ideas you have for the tile set I'd love to hear them, sure I'll think of a few more myself while sitting here.",,False,self,t5_2urg0,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1juh38/new_tile_set_idea_hull_exterior/

1371998147.0,1gwrac,Armor and Elemental Damage,Pwnatron,77,14,37,"I'm seeing a lot of misinformation everywhere so I'd like to clarify how armor and elemental damage work together and how your x type of damage interacts with different mobs.  

First of all

* damage = damage * 100/(100+armor)

Every type of damage that isn't on ignore list goes through this formula. That includes elemental damage like fire

Here's a list of ALL damage types that Warframe has:

* Bullet
* Explosion
* Stun
* Impact
* Knockdown
* Throw
* Blade
* Serrated Blade
* Finisher
* Poison
* Fire
* Water
* Freeze
* Electricity
* Callback
* Invalid
* Cinematic
* Magnetic
* Any
* Suicide
* Supernatural
* Forcefield
* Physics Impact
* Grab Pull
* Armor Piercing
* Shield Drain
* Laser
* Sonic

The basic damage is called Bullet. This is what most guns have.  
Explosion is stuff like Ogris explosion
Four of these are on almost every mob's armor-ignore list: Armor Piercing
The others are self-explanatory (somewhat).  

Every mob has its own list of protected body parts. If you hit a protected body part

* 0 bullet for head part (corpus crewmen)
* 0.5 electricity for any part (ancients)
* 2 fire for any part (most if not all infested)
* 1.5 bullet for head part (ancients)
* 3.0 serrated blade for any part (most light infested)

At this point
Then each mob has its own weak spots (e.g. head) which multiplies the damage again (e.g. 2 for head).

Examples for disrupting ancients (300 base armor):

* 100 fire damage hitting a level 5 disrupting ancient's torso would be reduced to 25 (100 * 100 / (100 + 300)) then multiplied by 2 due to the multiplier for a total of 50.
* 100 fire damage hitting a level 5 disrupting ancient's head would be reduced to 25 (same as above) then multiplied by 2 due to the multiplier and then again multiplied by 2 due to hitting the head for a total of 100.
* 100 bullet damage hitting a level 5 disrupting ancient's head would be reduced to 25 (same as above) then multiplied by 1.5 due to the multiplier and then again multiplied by 2 due to hitting the head for a total of 75 damage.
* 100 poison damage hitting a level 5 disruption ancient's torso would not be reduced because it's on ignore list then multiplied by 1.0 due to the multiplier for a total of 100 damage.

Here's in game testing that proves this (its scaling is wrong tho): [Ancient Disruptor Wiki](http://warframe.wikia.com/wiki/Ancient_Disruptor)

Example calculation for level 31 Grineer Lancer getting hit by Dread with level 8 Serration and level 5 Hellfire (352.5 normal):  

Lancer damage multipliers: 

* Fire: 1.25
* Electricity: 1.25
* Armor Piercing: 1.5
* Bullet (only head): 1.5

Big numbers incoming for accuracy:

* Calculate armor: 30^1.4 * 0.01 * 200 + 200 = 433.88359045497134889406398538164
* Calculate damage reduction: 100/(100+armor) = 0.1873067496133020223968174056274
* Round damage:  
normal -&gt; 352  
fire -&gt; 352 * 0.9 rounded to the nearest integer = 317
* Apply armor and multipliers:  
352 * 0.1873067496133020223968174056274 = 65.931... * 1.0 = 65  
317 * 0.1873067496133020223968174056274 = 59.376... * 1.25 = 74.22... = 74

Escape: Taking control away from the player is bullshit. It's lazy design. You know it. Everyone knows that. If you don't think so

Give the player the ability to shoot with his primary while on his back OR give the player the ability to quickly tap a button to wrestle free from the lasso  OR give the player a timed prompt to break free, and less mash.

To that end, I've went on a nostalgia spree. I've purchased a brand new MK1-BRATON (15kcr) and LATO (10kcr). I was going to pair these with a SKANA (15kcr + 15kcr), but seeing as even that has to be crafted now, I decided to instead go for a CRONUS (drop + 15kcr). I have also unequipped my Sentinel. All gear started at level zero, using only mods that dropped and would fit (read: none - warframe powers only).

**THE TEST:** Consisted of completing the following missions, Caloris, Elion, Lares, Tolstoj. Missions were completed solo, making sure to explore to slightly more than a reasonable degree, ""stumbling"" upon several semi-secret rooms.

**THE RESULTS:** Completed with one death (courtesy of Vor's teleport sneak attack). End levels: Ash 7.05, CRONUS 3.95 (sliver away from 4). Gained seven mods, including one Rare (Sundering Strike, dropped from Vor) and Redirection (dropped off an Infested). Gained Cronus blueprint. Gained 8,862 credits.

**CONCLUSIONS:**

**A:** Not able to purchase *anything*, not able to sidegrade to SICARUS (20kcr), not able to sidegrade to STRUN (75kcr). Don't even get me strated on craft requirements for some weapons. I've already faced and defeated a boss (unlikely, for a player just starting out) and I can't even switch up from the starting guns. This is *greatly* demoralizing.

**B:** Grineer Planetoid tileset is introduced alongside either a boss

**C:** CRONUS, specifically because you fight Grineer, which leads players to believe non-charged melee is utterly useless. Please consider A: Doubling slashing damage vs. light-armored humanoids (some Grineer, Corpus crewmen) the same way it's tripled vs. unarmored Infected and B: Introducing new low-level (&lt;5) Grineer mobs (placeholder name: Grineer Conscript), who are equivalent to Lancers but wear Light armor. Decrease amount in favor of Lancers as level increases.

**D:** The player is not sufficiently introduced to the Polarity system. Suggestion: Give the MK1-BRATON a single V polarity slot. Force the first mod you receive for completing a Raid mission (IE,False,self,t5_2urg0,1370477926.0,,rhino,t3_1fr8al

I hope that you are all doing well and having much fun sniping baddies with your shiny new toys. I'd like to extend a special congratulations to those that managed to nab a spot in the Top 100

With the felicitations finished, we can avoid some of the frustrations of this events in the next one and expand on what people actually enjoyed.

&gt; Let's start with the **PROS**.

___

* The Snipetron Vandal is a very good weapon; it is the best sniper out right now. Additionally
* They added Snipetron blueprints in for everyone (who got the twenty kills). 
* Getting twenty Informer kills was not hard.
* Offering a Dojo Statue really encouraged inter-clan competition. Additionally

&gt; And now

___


* The nature of the Informers, Warframe is primarily a co-op PvE game! I don't think than anyone really *liked* hunting what were essentially glorified balloons. They did nothing but alert you to their own presence.
* Poor communication between DE and players on various levels. For example
* Killing the informers just wasn't very fun.
* The personal kill goal was very low (twenty measly kills)
* DE should have notified players that they were taking the Snipetron off the market in the first place - while it was cool that DE gave us a last chance to have at it
* What was the point of giving out the Snipetron AND the Snipetron Vandal? I know that this isn't a strict con
* There has been talk of people using exploits to get into the Top 100, I know that many will also argue with me on this point).

&gt; **SUGGESTIONS.**

___

* Incentivize killing the special mobs by increasing their chance to drop mods
* Make the special mobs fun to play with/kill. When the Fusion Moas came out, they were inarguably more fun than the Informers.
* Create different personal reward tiers (25 drones, etc.).
* Communicate better with us

1375751917.0,1js4bf,My 15 problems with Warframe,hojomcc,88,31,64,"My 15 Problems with Warframe


1.  Molecular Prime:  Need to remove the 60 second debuff.  Nova is fantastic at taking out groups of trash-mobs and should remain that way.  The 60 seconds of double damage to highlevel mobs and bosses is icing on an already splendid cake.

2.  Fix the blue generator room:  The one in the Grineer Galeon that has every single new player running in circles for 10 minutes.  The stairs aren't very apparent to new players and they shouldn't have to be.  This room doesn't make sense.

3.  Orthos Prime:  Requires more resources then an Orthos but has the exact same stats.  It's the only prime weapon that functions this way.  

4.  Research Requirements:  Please add another object to the clan building process.  A system where we need to use 2 Fieldron, 6000 ferrite or something like that.  Make the requirements for the Other buildable object something other than control circuits and plastids.  The focus on plastids and control circuits is waaaaay to high.  Adding another object and lowering the fieldron costs would make that better.

5.  Add Credit Sink:  I know the average Warframe player doesn't have this problem

6. Don't Patch on Friday:  I loved hearing that update 9 was hours away a couple weeks ago.  If technical problems arise that delay it till the ass of night, patch Thursday or Monday.  Give yourself enough time to make the game stable after large updates.

7.  Enemy Armor Scaling:  This has been explained to death so I'm not going to go into detail on this point.  

8.  Prime Frames:  Also a point that has been talked to death.  Please make a level 30 version of the frame a requirement in the prime blueprint.  Frost Prime removes the need to own a Frost.  

9.  Increased Upper Limits on Mods:  I love how Serration and Hornet Strike work.  There needs to be something to do after you have unlocked all of the weapons and mods.  For me

10. More Transparency in Statistics:  At this point

11.  Remove Mod Button:  This feature is more important than a consignment store. It's more important than new maps.  It's more important than more weapons.  Having bundles of weapons makes this problem worse.

12. Event Contingencies:  Stop trusting your math.  There should always be a fall back scenario in events with limited resources.  The Formorian ships dying 13 hours before the scheduled end of the event was devastating to some players.  It arbitrarily punished people who were reasonably unaware of the exact event conditions.  This could have easily been addressed by having an additional Formorian ship appear in the event the players destroyed the initial ships.  If you want to keep the player base happy

13.  Paris Prime Sound: Small point but it seems to be universally agreed upon.  The Paris Prime sounds awful.

14.  Fix Mod List.   There is no reason to show us duplicate mods in the configuration screen.  We can't place duplicate mods on our weapons and frames.  Please stop having me go through 3 pages of Ammo Drum for no reason.  If we have more than 1 of a mod

15.  High Mastery Weapons:  With the addition of a few weapons we will be able to access Mastery 12.  I loved seeing the requirements on the Lanka and Acrid when update 8 rolled out.  Please give us a weapon or weapon skin for every possible mastery level.  Even if it's a small flame decal on the stock Lato.  High mastery level players have put huge amounts of time into the game

16. Add Charge Bar:  The Ogris and Lanka need a more visible charge bar

Now, because of the inherent fact that her powers punish the aggression of enemies, I would imagine that she has a high starting shield value, even if her health and armor are more lacking. Maybe...

Shields: 150
Armor: 50
Health: 100

Her powers would be the following.

Slot 1: **Disable**

*Mandala punishes a single enemy for their aggression, injuring them, and stunning them temporarily.*

Energy Cost: 25

Damage: 30/40/50

This power, that enemy's weapon starts to glow. When they're alerted, and attempt to fire, however, the weapon explodes in their hands, dealing damage, and Disarming them. If used on a disarmed enemy (whether because of her or Loki), taking half the normal damage.


Slot 2: **Guardian Seal**

*Creates a floating defensive seal that catches enemy fire in front of Mandala

Energy Cost: 10 per second

Damage: 25 damage

What this is is basically a small barrier that Mandala stops in one place, or it automatically releases, propelling the combined firepower forward. Less effective against slow firing enemies, DEVASTATING against enemies with a high rate of fire. It's similar to Nyx's Ultimate, but one a smaller, more focused scale. The width of the resulting wall of bullets would be similar to Frost's Ice Wave, for example. It's a line

Slot 3: **Open Palm**

*Mandala dashes forward, and sending them and those around them floating harmlessly into the air where they can be picked off at leisure.*

Energy Cost: 75

Damage: None

Not much to say here. Mandala dashes forward, sending them and their buddies floating into the air. The range isn't very impressive, maybe 10/15/20 meters in game. It doesn't actually HURT the enemy, just disables them for a few seconds.

Slot 4: **Nirvana**

*Mandala reaches out

Energy Cost: 100

Damage: Not listed. Similar to Miasma.

Duration: 6/8/10 seconds

This is Mandala's Ultimate. The screen changes perspective to view Mandala and her surroundings from above, it being a lotus is intentional) forms in the color of her energy, covering a large area. Any enemy that attacks in this area has her teleport next to them, and strike them with an open palm, vaporizing them instantly. On Bosses, it just does a LOT of damage. Not sure how much.

*(As a minor side note

My idea would be to do something along the lines of what Killing Floor does. Instead of just having it travel a certain distance, meaning your bullets/pellets will travel through indefinitely; however, only 20% of the total damage will follow, and so forth for the next enemy. Rifles could have a max of 80% or so while shotguns could get 100% (let's be honest, you're not gonna snipe anyone with a shotgun anymore). That would definitely make the 15 it costs worth it.

1. People have already touched on this but there doesn't need to be an energy cost for connecting hallways. This saves clans from having to put a reactor right off their initial hall. I know this can be demolished and moved later

2. When constructing pieces in the build menu

3. The hallways you can build, where there could be a duelists leaderboard within the clan or something to give a little sense of competition among clan members who PvP a lot. Other ideas: ""Builder's Hall"" (shows top donors to Dojo construction) and ""Raider's Hall"" (think global leaderboard as exists except clan specific).

4. Allow architects to plan ahead. If someone wants to make a research wing

5. Allow people to jump into missions with clan members from the Dojo. The Dojo right now feels like a place to go hang out and waste time, which is rather clunky and unnecessary. This change would make the Dojo feel more like a mission control, or base for your clan, rather than a fancy vacation house. ",,False,self,False,t3_1f3oad

 * **Cons**

* **Somewhat random flight path/physics.** It doesn't always fly in a line towards the crosshair, typically towards the ceiling. 

* **Not great for team play.** The Glaive follows the rule that projectiles are blocked by teammates' bodies. This means that it will ricochet off your teammates and *also off dead bodies that are still standing.* (E.G. people killed with frost damage.) These factors

* **Dependent on FPS/Ping.** The Glaive, it is severely affected by FPS. (I tend to get around 10-15 FPS in groups, and about 20-30 solo. I'm on a laptop, what can I say?) In a group and off-host, I could barely throw it in a straight line, much less hit anything with it. Solo, however


 * **Pros** 

* **High Throw Damage.** The base charge damage is 150, but I saw the number pop up.) EDIT: The throw does 3x damage to light infested, but normal damage to Ancients. 

* **TWO POLARITY SLOTS.** That's right folks, since Killing Blow (charge damage) is V-polarity, and Reflex Coil (charge speed) is Bar-polarity.

* **Looks and sounds badass.** This is the ultimate style-points weapon, the charge sound and in-flight sound are awesome. 

 * **Tips and Tricks** I will try to update this section a few times as I find new features.
* If you miss at first, maneuver so that the intended target is *between* you and the Glaive, which means it will hit them on the return path.

**Conclusion**

The Glaive is a very fun

* Final Note - There's a lot of bitching going on about ""Rah rah rah DE didn't give us a glaive alert instantly rah rah rah pay to win rah rah etc. etc."" and honestly, but don't quote me!), they ensure that people who buy the Glaive with Platinum have a day or so to enjoy it, get used to it, etc. before *everyone* has one, therefore making buying a Glaive a little more special, and more advantageous. Those of you who can't afford the Glaive, you will have one soon enough! Please don't rage at DE for trying to make money

Destroying the spore will trigger a viral infection to nearby enemies.

Change:

1372790528.0,1hihwz,Sentinel Weapon Mods PSA - What mods not to use on your sentinel weapons,MooCowMilkshakes,54,5,17,"First of all

Taken from the wiki:
&gt;The bonus to critical chance is multiplicative with the base critical chance of the weapon. **The formula is (basecrit%)+(mod%*basecrit%).**

This means that **Point Strike** (Dethcube and Wyrm rifles) and **Pistol Gambit** (Shade's pistol) are entirely useless

This *also* means that **Vital Sense** and **Target Cracker** mods are completely useless on Sentinel weapons.

Finally
&gt;These mods have been tested as NOT working (or unaffecting) on Wyrm's rifle:

* Ammo Drum (does not run out of ammo)
* Fast Hands (does not reload faster)
* Magazine Warp (approx. 7 bullets per magazine

It is unconfirmed whether the same is applicable to the other sentinels

**TL;DR - Don't use Vital Sense, or Pistol Gambit on your sentinel's weapons. Ammo Drum, Fast Hands, and Magazine Warp may also be a bad idea.**

1365849987.0,1c9hyj,Tutorial: Get real-time desktop alert notifications directly from the developers.,Arsonide,68,18,36,"So I'm going to quickly summarize how you can get desktop notifications (with popups and/or sounds) for your Warframe Alerts

So with so many options to keep track of alerts, and I appreciate the effort, and the Alert Notification forum was great as well. They both have a serious drawback though - they require users to submit the alerts, and they require users to finish the mission before you can find out what the reward is. This often results in an awkward ten minutes of limbo for alerts, which is no longer necessary thanks to the Official Warframe Alert Twitter feed. This feed updates within a minute of most alerts appearing in game, and it has the reward listed right there.

Let's start with the program you will need. It is called Feed Notifier. This program is the least intrusive one I could find. It sits quietly in the tray using barely any resources, and most importantly, it doesn't require any accounts, doesn't have any ads, is free, and generally is hassle free. The download for Windows is right at the top of their homepage, at http://www.feednotifier.com/

Once you have that installed, and go to preferences. Delete the default feed, and add a new one. Hit the add button, and in the ""Feed URL"" box, you'll want to put this URL: https://api.twitter.com/1/statuses/user_timeline.rss?screen_name=WarframeAlerts

Hit Next. Change the feed title to Warframe Alerts, but you'll probably want something greater than two minutes. I keep mine at two. Hit Finish.

You aren't quite done yet. At this point, with an associated sound to grab your attention. Clicking the tray icon will display the most recent alert. The problem, is that the alert feed also posts non-mystery (credit only) alerts. We can fix this, because they label mystery rewards with consistent identifiers: (Artifact) and (Blueprint) respectively. We will create a ""filter"" to block everything but these notifications. Alternatively, if credit rewards are your thing, you can scroll down to the end.

So hit the Filters button now

Uncheck the two options on the top right ""match whole words"" and whatever the other one is, and make sure that filter is set to ""On"", signified by a check mark.

Lastly, you might want to remove the x86). I made one here: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1032313/notification.wav

(The voice sample is from the War Friends Youtube video

You're done, and how long it has left, within two minutes of the alert popping up, and you don't even have to mess with Twitter.",,False,self,1365951867.0,t3_1c9hyj

* DISCLAIMER: **NO I'M NOT LOOKING FOR PVP. YES I UNDERSTAND HOW LONG IT SHOULD TAKE TO LEVEL EVERY WF/WEAPON/MOD.**

While I do generally tend to be a bit 'hardcore' with games I choose to play I generally argue against any tiered reward system for 'hardcore' content... but I relentlessly campaign for there to be at least some rudimentary end-game content that serves as a means of competition that can be perpetuated - even if artificially imposed.

* *'Why do hardcore players need a perpetuating system? Why can't they just enjoy the game for what it is without a carrot to chase?'*

 **First off**, and perfect that Mod-setup... and with everything in life, people inherently demand purpose &amp; value from their investments. The ""why can't you just enjoy using those items when you get them?"" rebuttal typically given at this point holds no water considering that if the game just gave you all such items from the start it would contain pathetically limited content.

Additionally, then lose any of the support that would go toward developing further content... but in this era of information sharing &amp; the importance of reputation, that's assured to happen if the hardcore base of players turn on any game.

...

**Secondly** - something I've noticed to be constant from one game to the next regardless of genre - is that regardless of their typically spiteful opinion of hardcore players ... the achievements and progress of the most hardcore players *always* serves as a net motivation factor for new incoming players. New players aren't stupid, **new players are just as concerned about content 'dead-ends' as those nearing it.** What motivates new players to continue playing progression-based games is the reality that their character will become better today than it was yesterday, and ultimately measure their character against competition. As it stands, the PvE content is not competition.
_____

I don't claim to have the solution to the concern - merely emphasizing its existence - but really

- Team Time-Trials &amp; Standings

While ""rushing"" is a bit controversial

- Defense Mission 'Leader Boards'

Quite simple concept of tracking the longest that teams have lasted in any given Defense mission. Easily measured in #Waves/#Enemies killed. Plenty of statistics could be incorporated such as the 'longest time defended before console takes damage'

- Clan-Based ""Star Crawls""

This was my favorite idea I've had for a while which I've left to last to not bother anyone no longer reading ... but I really like the idea of being given a random pathway in a planetary system, *and being given randomized restrictions along the way*. Restrictions such as only being allowed to use melee, randomized weapons, severely gimping 1 players' stats who must be escorted safely, or removing the map &amp; destination markers to force players to find the way out. The permutations would be practically infinite - great news to hardcore players - but the core function being to foster competitive cooperative teamwork that extends beyond singular missions &amp; extends to a chained sequence of missions. How such accomplishments would be measured and compared between clans/players would be debatable but the open-ended nature of the design leaves plenty of options.

.

______

**TLDR VERSION;** There remains an unrewarding hard cap on progression. The game in its current state leaves and players reaching that cap unsatisfied with the lack of content and purpose. Naturally it is the most hardcore players reaching this cap first. Hardcore players in any progression-based MMO - while not of any higher importance than casual players - inherently establish progression goals which motivate the new and lower level players by their competition. Displeased harcores typically translates into spiraling negative feedback that can starve the game from development resources it needs to improve content. MOST IMPORTANTLY - it would only take simple

- Farming the Corrupters can be done from any Infested map

- Each player can only equip one type (Alpha

- Once you have a group of at least 3 (it's worth it, but you can ride in if you're out.

- Once the mission starts you'll run along until you get to a big open room with 3 terminals in the middle.  Each of these terminals will have a prompt to insert an Alpha

- Once the countdown finishes

- At extraction, and it will be the same for all party members, depending on how many Corrupters you plugged in.   You get 3 points for just a Standard, 5 for a Standard + either an Alpha OR a Beta, 7 for an Alpha + Beta but no Standard, and 10 for all 3.  If you're running solo for some inexplicable reason (seriously, soloing this would take the max reward from 25 runs to 84, pug it up in general chat) just bring Standard Corrupters.

- To emphasize: you get the points regardless of your contribution to the mission.  If you did cartwheels the entire time while your team plugged in 3 Corrupters

- Each run seems to reduce the % of the ship by about 2, otherwise your hard work is just getting regenerated.  Focus DPS!

1. ""Quantum"" - Antimatter seeking grenades that explode/implode on impact and deal damage to enemy and nearby enemies (more deployed as ranked up).
 
2. ""Matter Conversion"" Deals damage to a single target. If the target is killed
 
3.  ""Gamma Ray"" By nuking one enemy with antimatter
 
4. ""Cherenkov"" The AM Warframe supercharges the matter inside target enemy causing them to explode in a bright blue (Cherenkov radiation color) explosion poisoning all enemies nearby (if dealing fatal damage) Causing them to radiate a bright blue (same as before) light that poisons all enemies nearby
 
5. ""Null Star"" Creates a mote of antimatter that  orbits around the Warframe which will seek out and collide with the nearest foe within a certain range. Motes last for a minute or until used. Maximum motes and number of mote spawned when activated increase with rank. Max Motes 2/4/8/12 Spawned per cast 1/1/2/3. Motes orbit for one second minimum before seeking a target.
 
6. ""Volatile"" Turns one enemy into a walking matter bomb
 
CURRENT LEADER:  5.  ""Null Star""
 
2nd Power
 
1. ""Relativity Shift"" The Antimatter Warframe Shifts the molecules at target location in a phase of pure energy causing a blinding flash and a deafening bang that will stun enemies nearby. (Can not be used when in a hull breach situation since there will be no molecules to shift)
 
2. ""Flash"" Creates a few positive/negative particles in each hand and then claps creating a small explosion that blinds nearby enemies.Deals damage to enemies within 2 meters.*
 
3. ""Gravity Well"" Creates a medium-sized black dome over the targeted enemy and any enemies trapped within are crushed with intense gravitational pressure.
 
4. ""Antimatter Drop"" Shoot a contained bubble of antimatter. Slow projectile (but doesn't fall)
 
CURRENT LEADER:  4.  ""Antimatter Drop""
 
3rd Power
 
1. ""Vector"" Rains down with particles/gamma rays, no explosions but a nice after effect on the floor).
 
2. ""Wormhole"" The AM Warframe shifts the matter in the surrounding area creating a wormhole entrance at his current location and a wormhole exit at target location. The AM Warframe and allied Tenno can travel through this wormhole while enemies will be unable to see it. (Upgrading this skill allows for more uses)
 
3. ""Negative"" Coats your melee weapon with antimatter particles making it so that every time your attacks make contact there is an explosion
 
4. ""Doppelganger"" Creates a dark-matter copy of any enemy the power is used on. This dark double retains all the abilities of the original however will fight for the player. The double will degrade due to reaction with matter in air and will explode on death.
 
CURRENT LEADER:  2.  ""Wormhole""
 
4th Power
 
1. ""Molecular Prime"" - Primes all enemies in a radius with antimatter. Upon death the antimatter and matter collide causing high damage in a certain radius. The explosions can kill other primed enemies and set off more explosions. Can kill new enemies in explosion radius. Good for chain reaction explosions. 
 
2. ""World Collider"" - Spawns a clone of self at target location. It then starts to sprint towards the caster
 
3. ""Annihilation"" - Casts two orbs in both hands: White and Black (Matter and Anti-Matter). The Warframe would then make a circular motion similar to Yin and Yang and press the orbs together
Enemies caught in the radius are dealt devastating damage while enemies within viewing distance are blinded.
 
4. ""Explosion"" - Converts all ground in front of you into antimatter. All matter touching this will trigger an explosion. Last upto 7 sec. 40 meter cone.

1374038338.0,1igunj,A radical warframe suggestion: Warzones.,esosa233,64,16,37,"SETTING:
Basically a warzone is a super level that takes up a large portions of a planet's terrain and has persistent events happening on it. A warzone can take up to ten or fifteen 4 person squads at a time, on Neptune you'll be fighting on top of ships floating above the watery surface, and on mars you'll be fighting along the red sand deserts and its inner network of tunnels. Each warzone has its own unique infested fauna and is chock full of resources if you're willing to explore the warzone. Also unlike levels the warzone continually exists, is always unlocked from level one, and is changing with new events by the minute, with factions gaining and losing footholds to each other, fighting each other, even if not a single player is playing in them.

OBJECTIVE:
In these beautifully rendered expanse levels there are several posts, basically the strength of the winning faction will be amplified greatly. But holding the largest share of posts in the warzone is not your only objective, as every squad has a different objective on entry, whether its to sabotage grineer mining machines (which you will see in action in the warzone) or steal a powerful weapon from a corpus camp, you'll have an ever changing objective in the great faction war to provide Tenno victory which you will be rewarded for upon completion. Levels in the warzone vary greatly giving new players an actual chance and high level players endgame content, a grineer commander may be level 57 but a non elite grineer lancer would be level 17 and so forth. Don't worry even if you can't survive a warzone you can help by completing as many missions as you can as it weakens forces in the Warzones. 

Note

EVENTS:
The most alluring part of these Warzones is the pure randomness of things on the battle field, or a stealthed Hek platoon may ambush your team,or may find a bunker full of nano spores and so forth. All while dodging grineer tanks, fire from over head corpus ships, poisonous long range volleys from the infested. Your objective will change and it will come up to you to attack your enemy vitally, or save the Tenno forces. Not including the special one time only events that can occur in a warzone, like a warzone only boss appearing at nightmare difficulty (we're talking huge and able to kill in one hit) and suddenly all the squads have to converge to defeat it

WEEK 2 (forgot to name properly):
http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1cw20h/stealth_brainstorm_it_needs_work_a_lot_of_work/

WEEK 1:
http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1cibfu/subs_weekly_bugs_thoughts_and_suggestions_week_1/



This is the third week of constant warframe.  I played during christmas for about a month after the holiday, just by how it plays right now.



**BUGS** (Boring part first)

----

The map will still 'lose' the waypoint sometimes

During the 'fly-in' cinematic

Headshot counter on end-game scoreboard still very unreliable. Almost arbitrary.

Large melee weapons, but very comical.

Phorid and Ancients will occasionally knock a player through geometry, killing them, and forcing them back to start.

Some of ember's abilities to attribute damage and kills to the player on the end game scoreboard

Occasionally

Bronco will occasionally get in a reload loop where it will constantly try to reload. This usually happens when the player is sprinting

Fast weapons, where the player will continue to do half charge attacks when the melee button is held. To stop this, player must stop attacking.

The Shade's 'ghost' ability will not give the player melee crits

During hectic defense on Xini with max number of players

**THOUGHTS AND SUGGESTIONS**

----

DE. I double dog dare you to make an enemy or boss who doesn't rely on stagger.  You guys put stagger and knockdown in everything, Sniper Moa, Rollerballs, Ancients, Crawlers, Chasers, Runners, Jackal, Napalm Bombards

I mean

Knockdown would also be fine if it didn't take my **highly agile

Here's what I suggest instead:

**Freeze**:  Hit the player with cold damage

**Electrical Damage**: If a player is hit with electrical damage

**Blind**: If a player is hit with 'blind'. You can do either one of two things. Cover the screen in gooey globs that slowly slide down the screen

**Jam**: Jam the player's weapon for a short duration

**Weakness/Lethargy**:  Should decrease jump height, and also slow down reload speed.  Rhino should be immune to this.

**Heat Aura**:  Around a fire-type enemy

**Deafen**: An enemy can give out a loud shreak, go deaf, and their UI should break for a short period of time.  Banshee should be immune to this.

**Pull/Push**: Players can be slowly sucked in towards an enemy

**Poison**: You already have it.  Saryn should be immune though.

**Confusion**:  A enemy could split into many different copies

**Possessed**: A player's controls could be reversed

Those are all the things that I can think of that you can use besides motherfuckin' stagger


::Moving on!::

**Stalker** needs to drop something when you kill him... or someting. I don't know

 ::Gametypes and Maps::

This is my favorite part

Right now we need more gametypes

**Demolition**: The Grineer/Corpus have a communications array on a planet that needs to be destroyed (basically, or go full out, but if you set off the alarm, giant turrets on the walls at compound you're trying to get to will start shooting giant balls of energy (Tribes Ascend style) at you.  Whoever gets to the top first can hack or destroy the turrets. Hacked turrets can shoot at enemies and everyone will get the affinity for it.  Inside, the player will have to place a bomb in the center of the compound which will cause the reactor inside to go critical.  The players will have a short countdown to escape as parts of the compound explode. To escape, they must *slide down the motherfuckin' mountain as shit blows up around them*.  Imagine it. You're sliding down with crap blowing up behind you, doing ninja flips over obstacles, until you roll into the exit and fly away just in time.

**New Maptype: City Block**
This would work great for Spy missions, but there would be countless of ways to approach each area. Grineer could really shiny as they work great in interior and exterior settings.  Ballista could set up on roofs, heavy gunners could sit at checkpoints,  and assault teams could ambush and close off players who move through the interior of buildings.  For the corpus, cameras could turn on powerful turrets which would target the player, but if the player finds the 'comm station' they could shut them all down, which could be a priority for a stealth player as it would no doubt be heavily guarded.  For infection, an ancient in a small room would be nothing to trifle with.

**Map-Type: Desert Outpost**: Players could start on the outside of an outpost in a sand-dune desert, and players would have to find a way to sneak in, or just smash open the gate and wreck face. The players would have to hack key points in the compound in order to open up a door which would lead down into the planet's crust, where the boss fight or objective would take place.  On the way back, they'd have to fight up through this tunnel which would no doubt be full of enemies waiting to make them suffer... unless of course they stealthed their way through.


**BOSSES**

I don't want to get into the current bosses

**Sniper Sisters**.  The grineer could have four legendary sniper sisters which would be cool in a large open map.  The player would have to track each down and keep mobile as each sniper would try to cover the other. Stealthy players would shine

**Chandlefear** A giant (like

**Apotheosis** A giant mech operated by several Corpus.  Would be quite mobile and constantly try to strafe the player.  The player could only destroy it by 'stunning it' (done by attacking an energy cell on its back) and doing damage to the armored corpus inside. If a Corpus is killed, and the pilot should control the movement.





::**HEAVY WEAPONS**::

We need em. But not that badly. Just some ideas that would fit the warframe universe.  All heavy weapons should slow down the player (except for the Rhino)

**Charge-Shot Plasma Cannon**  Basically, like a minigun.

**Cone of Damage Cannon.** Not sure if it would be plasma, but not fire, as you would still be able to put elemental damage mods onto it.  Pretty simple concept really. Also under-arm, like a minigun.

**Piercing railgun**. A weapon which would fire a line of damage that would pierce through many enemies

**Grenade Launcher** Pretty self explanatory.

***Experiment Part 1 Data screenshots [available here.](http://imgur.com/a/Nt7HT)***


________
**Hypothesis :**

If a team stays together at each defense point

**Test :** 

Five rounds will be played together as a team. Five rounds will be played as each player sees fit. 
______
**Help Needed :**

I need three other players to be with me for five rounds. They must stay in the same room as the objective as best they can during the five rounds. You will serve as both teammates and witnesses to the experiment to prevent my own bias.

Then we will evaluate if the same three players will remain as part of the second part of the experiment. If a new team must be formed for the second leg of the experiment

Finally

**Tenno Requirements** :


A level 30 Tenno would be best

I will be playing as a level 30 Frost.
_________
**Backstory :**

While farming XP, I have been of the understanding that more enemies will come to you if the team stays by the objective. **I believed the result was *more* XP, *more* potential for mods, and *more* potential for material drops.** I had an argument with another player while farming Kappa, and decided to try and figure this out once and for all. Thank you in advance for help, volunteering.

If you really want to encounter him is here a little guide.  
Take your fastest Warframe (Ash with max sprint for exemple) add a shade sentinel is a plus too.  
Go on Jupiter - Themisto and rush trough the mission
Then go on Mercury - M prime wich is a low level raid mission (looking for orokin artifact) and rush trough the mission without even taking down the ennemies (this should take you around 2-4 min). Repeat M prime until the Stalker shows up (and he will) then go again for J3 (rince and repeat).   
Don't forget to go invite only, other pub player will slow you down.

-Vauban's Bounce can also be used as a way to boost players forward. If you see a door, though; if you're backtracking or you hit the wrong side, it'll slow you down considerably. Additionally, you can cast Bounce while wallrunning. Place a Bounce on a wall, wallrun into it (without directly jumping onto it) and jump off as you pass over it, and you'll launch yourself away from the wall very quickly, but without any vertical movement.

-Vauban's Vortex is bugged, you can take advantage of this bug to jump massively high. As you run towards a vortex, jump, and you'll float upwards with no regards for the laws of physics. Combine this with a high wall and a well placed Bounce for massive jumps.

-Playing as Nova, since your camera automatically repositions to where you teleported from.

-Nova's Antimatter Drop can be shot to amplify its damage

-Nova's Molecular Prime also slows afflicted enemies and causes them to take double damage.

-Combine Excalibur's Super Jump and the Heavy Impact mod. Your Super Jump now has much more use!

-Ash's Smokescreen and Loki's Invisibility both increase your melee damage by a large percent.

-Ash's Teleport can be used to jump to teammates

-Use Banshee's Sonar with an extremely quick weapon for massive damage. Flux Rifle and Spectra are exceptional at this in particular.

-Shooting through Volt's Electric Shield with weapons that don't have built-in armor ignoring properties adds an extra 50% electric damage. You can shoot through and take cover behind either side of the shield

ABILITIES
 (ALL COULD BE USED IN AIR



---------------

**SLOT 1** : Blast

Jet extends his hand forward and emits a high energy burst of concussive propellent that can cut through flesh and armor alike.

It would perform somewhat like a short range railgun

**Cost: 10 Energy**

Range: 3 / 3 / 5 / 8 meters.

Damage: 50 / 75 / 150 / 200

**Cast Time: 0.2s**

------

**SLOT 2 :**  Dash Jet

Small engines in Jet's suit emit a powerful propellant

Would operate similarly to slash dash

It would do absolutely zero damage though.

Cost: 5 Energy

Range: 4 / 4 / 6 / 8

Damage: N/A

**Cast Time: Instant

----

**SLOT 3 :**  Afterburner

Engines on Jet's back would propel him forward in a straight line. As long as the ability is active

Cost: 15 per second / 10ps / 5 ps

Range: As long as the button is held and as long as the frame still has energy.

Damage: N/A

Cast time: 1s

----

**SLOT 4 :** Fuel Dump

Using an excessive amount of energy, rather than a typical spherical AOE.  Would have longer range than a normal, spherical AOE,  but would be directional. Less of an 'ohshit button' and more of a planned hit-and-run as it wouldn't work very well if you were surrounded.

Cost: 100

Range: 10 / 12 / 15 / 20

Damage: 1000 / 1000 / 1200 / 1500

Cast time: 1s


Base Stats: Same as Excals.

One: Fixed my sound issue
Two: Apparently with U8

Hello Warframers. So, after like two weeks of fucking with it, got it working quite well. And by ""quite well"", I can login, join my friends clan, shoot things in the face, and have fun.

So the rundown. I have to play in fullscreen mode or else I lag to all hell

Step one

Step two

Step 3

Step 4, 64-bit mode is working. I get slightly higher FPS (maybe 5-10fps more). You can try it, but I advise against it unless you can fix any issue that arises.

Step 5, the launcher will be complaining about not being able to find *~/.wine/drive_c/users/&lt;user_name&gt;/Local Settings/Application Data/Warframe/Downloaded/Public/Tools/Launcher.exe*. Cd into that directory and run **mv Launcher.exe.tmp Launcher.exe**. Click **Retry** in the launcher, and you should (with fingers crossed) be greeted with a login prompt. Type in your login information and press the **Login** button.

Now, Congrats! Enjoy Warframe in Linux my fellow Penguino! For the latter, be need to get dirty.

Step 6  aka **DEFCON 5**, 'lib32-libxml2', 'lib32-mpg123', 'lib32-giflib', 'lib32-libpng', and 'lib32-gnutls' packages (these are the names Arch Linux gives these packages, you may need to Google for the correct names for your distro) one by one and keep trying to login. You could get lucky and just be missing a dependency that's not letting you log in.

Step 7 aka **DEFCON 3**, it's in the AUR (https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/wine-mono/). This will take some time, but it solved the above *""Could not find Server""* issue for me.

Step 8 aka **DEFCON 1**

***TIPS*** *(I'll update this with more tips from other people once they come in)*

If the preprocess crashes

If ALSA doesn't work (and you don't get the *""Could not find XAudio2 Engine""* error)

If Sound doesn't work (or you get the *""Could not find XAudio2 Engine""*)

Turn off all the fancy stuff in the game options. The game will run better

It's been a while since the discussion on picking your frame's gender (female Ash, both for us and DE as far as I can tell. If I remember correctly, the major sticking point was that the devs were still on the fence about whether they wanted frames to just be suits, or to instead be distinct characters with their own personalities. I think we're sort of leaning towards the latter right now, but from a lore standpoint, this becomes kind of problematic when you have a group with duplicates of the same frame. Are they all that same character? Are they clones?

I've been kicking around an idea that would split the difference between the two extremes (frames as suits/frames as characters). What if wearing a particular frame causes you to take on the personality of the ancient Tenno warrior who inspired the frame's creation?

To flesh this out a bit:

Say there was a real Vauban, and perhaps one day a Warframe will be dedicated to you. Immortalizing your legend as a warrior is a very literal truth in Tenno society.

Of course, have lost their memory due to cryosleep), what time do they have to be themselves? Who's to say that they aren't slowly losing their own personalities, in favor of the frame's? If you subscribe to the idea that the Lotus may not have our best interests at heart, who's to say that this wasn't her plan all along - to mold us into a race of soulless, fanatically loyal copies of history's greatest warriors?

And if we're gonna do the whole tinfoil hat thing

Just something to think about.

###Story

So I joined a defense mission for one of the new artifacts. Unlucky(?) for me it was **20 waves** of corpus. I thought to myself let's make the best out of it.

* Host did not lag

* We had a decent team: Ember, Rhino

* And everyone seems to talk english

When we got to **wave 16** the Volt asks if it's ok he go AFK for **2-3min**. As everyone in the team was in a generly happy mode and it still wasen't the ""hard"" waves we said ok.

---
###Problem 

We are now on **Wave 5** and the guy is **STILL** afk. and it's now we started to reflect on it

As I said I am not mad at the guy mostely irretated but *no hate towards him* as I don't know what might have happend to him IRL, He fainted I don't know but the problem still exsists.

But as there is nothing we can do we just keep playing. Now on **Wave 2** we all die due to simply getting overrunned and the mission failed.


And in the end I did not get the artifact becuase there was no more time to find a groop :(

---
###Proof

""[Pictures of what I got](http://imgur.com/a/N3Ht2#5AGg7S4)""

Picture explenation:

 * Picture 1: We start to reflect over that he is AFK on wave 5

 * Picture 2: Showing Chat box.

 * Picture 3: 3 waves after I started to ""document"" it he is still AFK

 * Picture 4: Everyone but the AFKer dies on Wave 2 out of 20

 * Picture 5: Proof that he was AFK - Kills

 * Picture 6: Proof that he was AFK - Items

 * Picture 7: Proof that I did not have time to find a new groop

I went out and bought a butt load of keys to try and get a feel for the new maps and see if there are any new secrets or otherwise important features!


First

**CAPTURE:** In this mission you have to capture the same poor Corpus bastard who has been suffering since he was added. This mission runs on the same seed as the older maps (albeit with new rooms added) so no special layouts.


**MOBILE DEFENSE:** Already we start off different in [this](http://i.imgur.com/jN5M7xd.jpg) room. Then

The major difference of this mission is the run room. HO-LEE-CRAP the run room. You must first begin running the familiar path, a quick jump over some ice pads to the end of the room and the treasures are yours! The escape route is slightly different as well. An additional room seen [here](http://i.imgur.com/XV8SkzT.jpg). 

NOTE: I am not sure if this new run is exclusive to mobile defense.


**DEFENSE:** In this mission you have to defend a very poorly protected crypod from some very hard hitting enemies for a set number of waves. You are placed in a [large room](http://i.imgur.com/Nrds2Qe.jpg) with a lower and upper floor. Laser panels surround the defense pod and can be activated with [these switches](http://i.imgur.com/msiXQ9F.jpg) but have a 30 second cooldown before they can be used again. All they do is make one small sweep from the panel across and back before they shut down. They do a lot of damage and can thin the herd if you're being swarmed. As for secrets

Word of advice, etc. Even Defense I can be a bit of a challenge because of how much damage the enemies do.


**MISC:**

I noticed that a new music plays when doing the puzzle runs. May have been coincidence.


**NEW ROOMS:**

To go along with the percentage of alerts showing up on a planet

	Ceres: 9.13%
	Earth: 5.02%
	Eris: 11.87%
	Europa: 8.22%
	Jupiter: 5.48%
	Mars: 7.76%
	Mercury: 3.20%
	Neptune: 5.94%
	Pluto: 5.94%
	Saturn: 9.59%
	Sedna: 11.87%
	Uranus: 10.50%
	Venus: 5.48%

An interesting thing to note is that some planets have more alerts than their percentage of missions might suggest.  Meaning that unlocking those planets completely will

Another thing to note is that the average time for the non-ultra-rare alerts is all effectively the same.  So, and overall.  At this point, I do not believe the Vauban BPs are in the ultra-rare group. Of the four Vauban alerts this week, there was a 50m, two ~60m, and one 1.5h.  Compared to all 1.5h ish for the Forma/potatos.  

I will also post the 4/22 - 6/28 data provided by /u/PlasmaSheep in a post below

The first thing to notice is the alert interval.  It is up from 30 min to ~38 min.  This means that alerts are ~25-30% less common than they were before the Alerts 2.0 system came out.  However, note that the percentage of credit-only alerts has dropped.  It has gone from 85% credit only to just over 81%, meaning that the ratio of reward alerts has gone up by ~25%.  

So, just fewer credit-only alerts.  

Another thing to note is the credit value of alerts.  On average, that means that there are approximately the same number of credits per time unit being offered through alerts, but with more reward per alert.  

Also, and two instances where there were five active at once.  But the average number is approximately two alerts going at any given time, something which most of us could have guessed, but it's nice to have hard numbers.  

Credit for me including seperate data for ultra-rare alerts goes to /u/Absolutionis for pointing that out to me.  Credit to /u/Vapad for asking about data on the number of alerts active at once and getting me to write that method into my code.  

One thing I'm considering is posting my code and the json file containing the data.  Is that something people would be interested in seeing?  

I *think* that's most of what there is to talk about.  If anyone has any other stats you think I should track

1367770178.0,1dqibe,Warframe UI Live stream success! Images / Details inside!,tr3Ks,48,12,42,"Last night I had my livestream event which

I got great feedback from all the viewers and the people that submitted ideas / suggestions for what they would like to see for the game interface updates / changes. Below I'll post the images and give a little breakdown of what is going on

_____________________________________________________________________

**MAIN MENU**

Alright so we'll start off with the main screen. The goal for this was to make sure that the UI didn't take you out of the galaxy map, and messages always visible in some way, shape, or form.

http://i.imgur.com/6OkNGKa.jpg

To accomplish this I made the menus pull up and down by simply clicking on tabs that make them slid up or down accordingly.

http://i.imgur.com/S7ZIpqR.jpg

the chat also slides out from the social panel so it's not always intrusive

http://i.imgur.com/FFC2fQq.jpg

_____________________________________________________________________

**FOUNDRY**

Next up is the foundry screen. Not much needs changed here, or what you have ready to go for each different slot as they're ready. Also, having an inventory button on the screen is REALLY important to me. As of right now, you have to hit back, click arsenal, click inventory, and go from there; simply putting the button on this screen would get rid of that and streamline the workflow.

http://i.imgur.com/TM0HnGZ.jpg

_____________________________________________________________________

**LOADOUT**

The goal here was to make it easier to see what mods you have in each weapon respectively.

On the left you'll see you have your Warframe name with DETAILED information about it, weapon, secondary, and melee. each showing if its ""potato'd"" or not, as well as level.

On the right

You also will have an Inventory Button and Mod Button

Lastly in the top left you'll see the preset button

http://i.imgur.com/KlHirfA.jpg

_____________________________________________________________________

**MOD SCREEN**

As the mod screen currently stands

To fix this I decided to use an ""accordian"" style system for the mods. You can see how many variations of 1 type of mod you have in the bottom corner of the card

http://i.imgur.com/cNz0pjk.jpg

_____________________________________________________________________

**MISSION SELECT**

It would be AWESOME if you could see the points sitting on a larger more detailed planet. If its on a space station

http://i.imgur.com/H6ptRYS.jpg

_____________________________________________________________________

**COMBAT UI**

For the combat UI, as much as possible, be locked to my reticle.

With that said I used a design based on the ARC HUD UI mod from World of Warcraft. Which I ALWAYS loved and thought more games could use.

Your shield, sentinel shield/hp, target hp, and four skill boxes below. Below that 3 bars or 4 bars indicating your teammates health, Always on screen for people playing trinity or just wanting to see who needs help.

Also, the map and everything move to the respective locations.

Lastly

http://i.imgur.com/ZGfu4bc.jpg

Swapped sides

http://i.imgur.com/ZHqoeee.jpg

_____________________________________________________________________

**GAME END SCREEN**

All that needs to be shown here is more information about what was picked up. Include RES in the screen

Below that, or instantly requeue for the mission they just finished.

THATS IT!

Sorry, the scorpion, this incredibly Mortal Combat-clichée  ""GET OVER HERE"" character wielding a machete.


Where to start? What worries me is how rushed in development this enemy is. [I took a screen capture at brief moment I was grabbed


I read a topic regarding how player-stunning abilites are BS yesterday. I understand why people have concerns with this, the DURATION of said stun effect generally is based around this one idea. The Scorpion's action does not have any type of restrictions if not for RANGE. I have had several occasions where this enemy would pull me through cover-type props (like crates and barrels) that would normally occlude any type of explosion or projectiles.

1368890103.0,1ekuxd,The Rhino dilemma,BigSwerve,56,17,37,"The Rhino nerf on Friday certainly hit the frame's overall role very hard; I wanted to start a serious discussion about this here (and move it to the forums later). 

In case anyone missed it
&gt; Rhino Skin no longer grants full invincibility

Now what was the thought process that led up to this nerf? What was DE thinking?!?!?! /sarcasm. I think a good long look needs to be taken at Rhino's role in a game.


**ROLE OF RHINO**

* Obviously a tank, 150 armor, 100 power, 100 health. The wiki says Frost is designed more for damage and casting while Rhino's abilities are based on cc and stuns, but the obvious answer here is Iron Skin. 

* Rhino is made for frontline combat, toxic ancients, you name it. Enemies you had to make sure to keep a distance from with other frames. *THIS WAS WHAT MADE RHINO SPECIAL*. This was what made him so satisfying to play. A tank that had no competition when it came to the ""true"" definition of tanking.

**THE PROBLEMS**

* Iron skin, streamline, and flow (which rhino players stacked.) Shield mods were prioritized over armor and health (""a good rhino player should be taking negligible health damage"") and many rhinos could go over a minute of invincibility. 

* Many people only used iron skin, on the most part, ignored, due to its pitiful damage (compared to other frames aoe spells) and high energy cost. Heck, I haven't used radial blast once; I don't even know what the effects look like. 

* With Iron Skin, all he needs to worry about it killing them before they lose interest and go for his teammates or the pod. Which ends up being spamming charge attacks. While being in ""god mode"" is fun, it was boring and repetitive and decreased my overall skill as a warframe player, a fact i noticed when I got a brand new Loki and started leveling him. It also lets rhino players go into their own little ""world,"" not minding others and swinging/shooting away. 

**EFFECTS OF THE NERF**

* Apparently Rhino should still have full cc immunity, it was what separated him from others. 

* He no longer regenerates shields for the duration, is two nerfs in one. Now rhino players are encouraged to use iron skin as they initiate as opposed to when their shields are down, and retreat when their health starts falling as that cannot be regen'd. In fact it ~~encourages~~ forces the use of iron skin even further. If DE planned to encourage the usage of his other abilities or just weaken him in general, they hit him in the wrong areas. 

**TLDR: In my humble opinion, but hit him at the wrong angle. Iron Skin is simultaneously Rhino's most broken and most iconic/rewarding focal point, and there are ways to fix the first part and preserve the latter WHILE promoting teamplay, cooperation, and synergy. (see below)**



**A BRAINSTORMED IDEA/SUGGESTION**

Make Iron Skin his 3rd ability

* This fixes the problem with Iron Skin being too spammable. Only the rhino's with the best mods will be able to use Iron Skin repeatedly (although I'm a fan of keeping it 75 just so new people and those that are unlucky with rng drops (flow, people will have to think more about using it instead of throwing on iron skin whenever they see an enemy. ""Is it worth blowing Iron Skin right now?"" ""Can I make enough of an impact by going invincible?"" These are the thoughts a rhino player should be thinking, and increasing the cost of the ability is a step in the right direction. 

* The taunt is, the balance of iron skin, synergy and teamwork. The role of rhino is to tank. Not in the durable-caster way of Saryn and frost, but to be in the thick of things. Taunt takes pressure off his teammates and lets him utilize his above average stats/IRON SKIN for his teammates. It ALSO adds a different dynamic on Rhino. Now it'll be much more difficult to kill all these enemies in the 15 seconds that Iron Skin gives him, as there are more enemies of varying distances from him. And since Iron Skin is a costly ability, he cannot spam it. When Iron Skin runs out he will be relying on his stats. So if he communicates with his team, they will take advantage of the taunt and use their aoe or firepower for a ""combo"" so to speak. 

Synergy and teamwork is what really, and will add to the longevity of the game. Hell, I've even friended people after a game of good combo's and kept playing with them.

Why is this needed?

Finally, and a very small amount of Melee XP.  So, solo players mastery goes up much more slowly because to level items they actually have to use them.

While this alteration does not truly solve any of the above problems it mitigates most of them at least partially without breaking anything at least that I am aware of.

Just ran Xini as my First Win of the Day, eagerly check my foundry and... nothing. No BP, no key, no mods. My frame's level was back where it was before the mission had started.   


I haven't had this issue with any other missions I ran before this one. The only difference is that First Win of the Day happened.   


Checked the forums


TL;DR Make sure the mission you get the First Win of the Day bonus on isn't something you care about

**EDIT:** It's looking like the bug might affect everyone in the group. So if one person has First Win of the Day


UNIMPORTANT EDIT: Interestingly enough, then Xini again. Stalker showed up targeting me (as it had done the first time), yapping about how I will pay for killing Golem (it had been Phorid the first time). He dropped a Dread BP.

grineer pa system: When a grineer presses the pannel a pre-recorded intercom blazes across the ship saying ""they're here""


grineeer broken telephone: ""they're here"" that's how the ship is alerted and strings of enemies come.  The ones that stay behind are the ones that got the message wrong (telephone broke)


endless defence: you are actually killing scouting parties that are sent after each other to see what happened to the previous scouting party


All female warframes should be voiced by DE rebecca


**suggestion:** ff 12 sentinel system


**suggestion:** always have the option to cycle through abilities (in air, ability to type into chat always (i.e. banshee's ultimate you can't do either so it's 7 seconds of waiting)


**fix:** chat and health bars should not overlaping


**fix:** opening chests should not stop reloading


**antimatter: ultra:** disperse into nanomachines/antimatter particles and engulf everything ( kind of like disintegration of capture target


**antimatter: ultra:** giant pulse cannon morphed from arms (we have no ultra where a giant forward beam is made


**antimatter:** orca/whale sound with deep bass when ultimate is cast


**antimatter:** gimp arm disintegrates along with the body and leaving through that arm hole
 enemies while armour kneels as a empty husk


**suggestion:** voice acting for warframes


~~**fix:** game thinks you are airborne


**volt suggestion:** aoe would unlock doors


Lotus reroutes ships to cloning facilities


**suggestion:** synergize ultimates


**suggestion:** tally of resources gained at end of mission


**Suggestion:** allow experience gain with forma polarization


**Suggestion:** experience gain from finishing a crafting item


**Suggestion:** portraits for gaining mastery ranks


**suggestion:** A cancel button


**suggestion:** dread bow dismemberment should also pin dismembered piece allowing for penetration kills


**suggestion:** mission mixups
causing it to crash into the space rock and be flanked my 10 grineers as you crawl out with no shields and half health.  It sounds unfair

- Or have bosses do actual cool stuff.  Currently: ""General vor has unfathomable powers!"" He teleports sometimes, finisher moves, exclusive arenas, LARGER bosses. Bad ideas, but boss fights are pretty plain at the moment.  Jackal is the best so far, also the one boss that drops frost pieces.

- could also mix in those random mixups into boss fights.


**suggestion:** air dash/ redirection


**suggestion:** slower rise during entrance of solo missions


**suggestion:** sentinel commands on the fly


**want:** proper community tabs: global clans, etc


**suggestion:** individual warframe traits: banshee fires bow weapons with faster velocity, etc
.  Something unique from the base stats


**suggestion:** saved mod loadouts, drag outside of the box to de-equip, Better way to view mods(more vertical rows), more noticeable differences based on mod level (color, glow, shiny?)


**suggestion:** status/attribute page with mod effects(on off) in main menu/arsenal


**fix:** banshees [butt pixel](http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1h62p1/my_warframe_notepad/)


**suggestion:** sentinel husk when dead


**suggestion:** stomp dodger mini-game


**suggestion:** sentinel health bar


**suggestion:** objective waypoints appear at the end point of the room itself and not just on the mini-map.


**suggestion:** green shroud

_______________________________________________________________________________________

new stuff


**suggestion:** don't have a roll after jumping off small ledges


**sugggestion:** different colour waypoints.  Player spotting waypoint, but I would like physically present markers on the field much like player spots)


**suggestion:** Popup message for demotion or promotions in clan.


**suggestion:** full rotation when down


**suggestion**:  distance for actual objectives


**Suggestion:** After 8.3


**Suggestion:** Show the enemy level range while hovering the mouse over the planet.


**Want: **tenno base hub


**fun:** when the escape pod leaves it creates a vacuum in space and sucks a few enemies and items out


**suggestion:** vacuums should space some enemies (warframes have magnetic boots and are invulnerable until they jump

**Fix:** running out of secondary ammo while holding data masses will make you drop the mass and switch weapons.  If someone is unaware of this

**Suggestion**: A favorite or lock button for mods so you couldn't sell or use as fusion fuel.  Would also have a favorites list so you can pull up your favorite (beefed up) mods quickly for allotment.

- Pistol Ammo +20
- Rifle Ammo +20
- Shotgun Ammo +10
- Sniper Ammo +10

In some cases this is fine, and even with +30% mag capacity and +30% max ammo, it runs out incredibly quick, especially fighting level 30+ enemies, and with the 20 rifle ammo drops, once it's out it's pretty much out for the rest of the mission.

So my idea is that rather than dropping a set number of ammo per pack, which for my Gorgon would be roughly 49 bullets per ammo pack (7% of 700 bullets total). And each gun would have a differing percentage based on their total ammo.

Target prioritization is wildly inefficient. Oftentimes one bolt will go to each target

Flat damage is too low for the numerous problems to be acceptable.

**PROPOSED SOLUTION:**

As they are *psychic* bolts

Have them spread out evenly on targets so that the small damage that they do is used efficiently.



Nyx's psychic bolts would be effective and fun to use as a fire and forget ability.

These problems are most evident on grineer defense missions

1370047589.0,1ffte6,[Lore] Conjecture on the Origin/Identity of the Stalker,FatherSuperior7,40,6,39,"Due to Warframe still being in beta, most notably on the Stalker. Through dialogue and some game mechanics

I was attempting to farm the Stalker through the popular method of killing an easy boss, the lair of Golem, I was subjected to Lotus briefing me on the hulking monstrosity. Lotus said that Golem was created by the Orokins themselves as a super weapon in an ancient war against ""The Sentients"", an ancient enemy the Technocyte Plague was made to destroy. There is virtually no information on these ""Sentients""; all we know is that they waged war against the Orokins. In retaliation, the Orokins created the Technocyte Plague, which resulted in the Infested we fight today.

My theory is that the Orokins attempted to create an army of autonomous Warframes to fight their battles for them, swore vengeance upon the Tenno, and became known as ""the Sentients"". I propose that the Stalker is a remnant of ""the Sentients""; this can be seen in his arsenal. As the Technocyte Plague's victims ravaged ""the Sentients"", naturally they would develop some means of effectively combating the hordes of Infested; the Stalker's arsenal contains weapons that all have some advantage over the Infested. Dread (the bow) and Hate (the scythe), the Stalker's primary weapons, both deal 3x damage to non-Ancient Infested units. Despair (the kunai) prevent Infested Runners from exploding upon death; however, they only deal half damage to light Infested units, I believe there is enough evidence to support the idea that these are subtle hints about the lore of Warframe and the Stalker.

The real mystery of the Stalker lies in its motives. We can only speculate as to why the Stalker would hunt down Tenno for assassinating important Grineer, so I will offer just a few:

* ""The Sentients"" have cultivated a grudge against the Orokins that has festered and morphed into a blind rage towards the Tenno. However, coupled with that of the current mission, leaves the Stalker's victim in a weakened state.

* The Stalker's warped sense of justice and/or hatred towards the Tenno causes it to assume the role of devil's advocate: it would normally not think twice about slaughtering Grineer, but it sympathizes with the notion of annihilating the Tenno. When the Stalker witnesses these factions being struck down, it sees a relation to ""the Sentients"" being oppressed by the Orokins. By using the assassination of an important figures from the factions as justification for murdering the Tenno, the Stalker can maintain the illusion of honor by fulfilling the role of a righteous executioner, striking down the oppressive overlords.

* ""The Sentients"" may have been active in the shadows while the Tenno were in cryogenic stasis

TL;DR- The Stalker is a ""Sentient""

2) He now aggro's enemies to draw fire by using Iron Skin

I believe the damage Sound Quake now does is working as intended... but being vulnerable during the casting animation is problematic. Will inform and suggest invulnerability be returned.

**DEV** version: 2013.05.09.14.00

* **Crossbolt** (weapon) (*it's not the Boltor
* **StalkerBow** ( *=&gt; Weapons/Tenno/Bows/StalkerBow | seems new
* **ElectricBolt** (*caution: Could be anything! Only shaders have been added yet*)
* **PowersuitAbilities** (*stuff that the Warframes can do*) contains stuff like ""DojoBuilder"" (*because enabling the Dojo building UI is actually a skill that is triggered*). It also contains something called ""**SecurityCamera**"", then: Why would you need it? Infiltrators in your clans Dojo? I am just trying a shot in the dark here, keep that in mind! (/u/catalyst2222 mentioned: ""Security camera skill is for spectating duels i guess"", good point!)
Also new PowersuitAbilities: BouncePad, ProjLauncher, TableLib, ZapProbe
* **SuperMOA** received some new stuff: Meshes
* In the 5th livestream they were talking about a **cube-kind of sentinel**. So the client containes some ""**OroDCube**"" stuff, it was there a few weeks ago, but I couldn't match it to anything at that time - it also could just be something for the Dojo, derp)

Actually there is a shitload of more stuff

I’ve noticed a lot of negativity on the official Warframe forums concerning the latest patch but more specifically

First

I will go so far to say that this is much more than just a new enemy or type of mission; this is an excellent way for the development team to *test* new introductions to the game. We must be mindful of our current position as players within Warframe

This is also a rather interesting way to build upon the story and architecture of Warframe. As it stands, we are effectively shaping the outcome of the future of the game. I’m suggesting that perhaps we’re more than just players in a static game; we *are* the game.

The Operations event is also unifying players and encouraging us to form and strengthen bonds between one another. As we strive to complete this seemingly impossible goal (and it is far from impossible) we’re creating memories with our friends and clan mates. I can think of no better way to bring together a global community of gamers than to give them one massive goal to complete, that I’ve already grown closer to the people I spent all night with grinding toward the completion of this task. (All four of us will remember the excitement and comradery we felt when wave 5 in our defense mission yielded a Hell’s Chamber.)

As for incentives… well, consider the affinity, mods and potential for new content. This is just speculation but perhaps reaching the 100% mark will yield a Europa boss that drops the blueprints for a new warframe or weapon(s).

I feel at this point I’m preaching to the choir

Imagine a space in your dojo that collects various aquatic specimens for observation--but its not a room for scientific investigation or research, and the entrancing slow movement of marine animals set the tone for this space, while also offering a hint towards undiscovered places and life forms of the Warframe universe. Customization options could include aquarium sizes and placement, lighting or tinting controls on the fish tanks (want your water to be red?), or perhaps you even choose what specimens you want in your Aquarium.

[Statue Room](http://i.imgur.com/YmKtDCz.jpg)

I'm not sure what this reminds me of more, banners, pedestals, and statues that reach the ceiling. This space really feels like the central location for your clan to catalogue and display their exploits as memorials. Did you take down Councillor Vay Hek in the Earth system? Add his shattered mask to your showcase. Did your clan come out on top during the Fomorian Invasion? Place a 70ft statue of a Grineer mothership to loom over everyone. Did your Clan top the leaderboards (coming soon) this week ? Fly a banner that proclaims your triumph! We'll provide the objects and spaces to display your gear, you choose what to display!

Now then, so needless to say I've had it for a while.  During this time I've seen the HEK go from being able to pump out a few hundred percent multishot easily with 8 pellets, down to 7 with no mods at all when update 7 hit.  I've since then worked hard and gotten it back to something [like this](http://i.imgur.com/l3iLQtk.jpg).

There was one thing that was unique about the HEK

It was this that makes the HEK something special and powerful.  The tight spread allowed it to still hit enemies despite not being in what I would call 'Melee Range'.  It doesn't have the most damage

Was this balanced? Maybe, the super long range mob killing didn't matter since I carried a Lex.

This damage fall-off, Bronco mainly) have more potential damage up close with the Strun having more crit chance and more pellets which, with the multiplicative nature of multishot becomes a monster, **and** a bar polarity slot to fit in more mods on top of that.  The Strun was already a short ranged weapon, best used very up close so you could put all of the shot in to whatever you were aiming toward so this falloff damage nerf shouldn't be a problem for it.

In the end, I honestly never felt like the ability to kill trash mobs faster was ever a big deal really since boss killing was still a job best suited for a damage over time weapon like Boltor.  All I can really say, through all my rambling, I'm putting away shotguns for now.  If I have to be sitting down with someone for afternoon tea to kill them, I'd much rather use a gigantic Axe.

If you have a phobia of parentheses(bracknophobia?)

The ideal mod setup to use is a Ogris equipped with rank 10 Serration(2.65x damage), rank 5 Cryo Rounds(basedamagex0.9 Freeze damage added), rank 5 Stormbringer(basedamagex0.9 Electrical damage added), and a rank 5 Vital Sense((final damage)x(2)x(1+1.2)). I would add Primed Chamber, but It only affects sniper rifles and I don't think the Ogris counts.

The, and with a critical hit(assuming the Ogris' explosion can crit, and I'm not certain if it can).

Under these ideal conditions, but the remaining bits should logically be moving so fast that they could effectively penetrate shielding and turn even heavy armor into more flying bits, producing secondary, tertiary, probably quartary, and quite possibly quintary kills.

Its really just easier to say that under these conditions

Here is the equation I used:

 Been playing for a while now, is the most jarring and frustrating part of the game.

I understand that the idea is likely to balance out high-affinity pistol users; I should know

* The penalty of reduced movement and exclusive use of pistols while downed feels like enough in most games that have this system. You are no where near 100% effective.
* Being unable to drag myself towards an ally or cover except exclusively backwards, much less a highly trained space ninja.
* With a movement system that relies so much on moving and turning about
* The idea of being incapacitated but able to fight back communicates to me that you should help clear the area or distract as much as possible to help your teammates pick you up

- Fixed UI becoming non-functional when attempting to view Solar Landmark.

- Fixed inability to reload Twin Gremlins while sprinting.

- Fixed boss drop tables. A blueprint will no longer drop 100% of the time being a “Chassis”. Every Blueprint has a chance to drop

Please see DE_Steve’s post regarding Drop Tables 2.0

- Fixed issues with the Transmutation feature. Users were unable to see or use mods resulting from Transmutation. Inventories also became unstable if a Transmuted mod resided within.  A script will be run to correct the inventories of players who had been affected.

- Fixed Ogris charge sound effect playing randomly when it wasn't being charged.

- Fixed being able to parry while ziplining.

- Fixed appearance of Ether weapons. Our weapons manufacturer apologizes for the defective translucency in the 9.5 model.

- Fixed rare loss of functionality that could occur when leaving/being disconnected from a session while in the main menu.

- Buffs to Orthos Prime

- Fixes for gameplay crashes.

- Fixed custom colours not applying to Miter saw blades or boomerang.

Just for fun, but the hours of the alerts as a whole are quite evenly distributed.  

One thing of note

In this week, I have no way of knowing what happens when a second race shows up in a mission).  So far, I have just over 200 data points in that, which is enough to start having a picture of it.  There is some varience, but the data is close enough to the expected 33.33% to be random varience.  

Also, than other types of alerts.  I'm assuming there's some form of weighting going on, either direct weighting or indirect weighting through multiple reward tables.  

Other than that

	Changelog:
	 7/18/2013: Added in code to log what faction each alert mission is
	 7/25/2013: Added in code to the parse script to display the proportion of missions featuring each race

**WARFRAME - COSMETICS**

* **Menticide Helmet**

&gt; Stamina +25%

&gt; Shields -5%


**NYX - ABILITIES**

* **MIND CONTROL** - 25 Energy

&gt;&gt;*Nyx invades the psyche of a target

&gt;* Only one target may be controlled at a time.
&gt;* Duration of 15 / 20 / 25 / 30 seconds. This can be increased with Power Duration (Continuity).
&gt;* Target is stunned for about 2 secs.
&gt;* Range of 20 / 40 / 50+ / 50+ in-game meters. This can be increased with Power Range (Stretch)
&gt;* Cost to equip of 2 / 3 / 4 / 5 which is then halved by the Polarity slot
&gt;* Mind-Controlled targets use their abilities to the benefit of the Tenno and to the detriment of their former allies. For example;
&gt;* The mines dropped by Mine Ospreys will not hurt Nyx and her allies
&gt;* The heal pulse of Ancient Healers restores 100 Health to Nyx and her allies. It also restores the health of the Cryopod.
&gt;* Mind-Controlled Security Cameras will ignore everything and never go into the alerted state. Mind-Controlled Turrets can behave unpredictably.
&gt;* Not all abilities or effects currently help the Tenno. Mind-Controlling a Shield Osprey will not stop it from generating a shield around Crewmen
&gt;* The Mind Control effect will not work on bosses. However the ability still applies a short duration stun. 

* **PSYCHIC BOLTS** - 50 Energy

&gt;&gt;*Nyx launches a cluster of force bolts at enemies

&gt;* 50 / 50 / 100 / 125 dmg per bolt. This is increased by Power Strength (Focus)
&gt;* Cost to equip of 4 / 5 / 6 / 7 which is then halved by the Polarity slot
&gt;* Does 300% damage to light infested units. Does normal damage to infested Ancients.
&gt;* Targets enemies randomly nearby to the original cast location.
&gt;* Seeking tends to fail unless thrown from a fairly close distance. (is this valid anymore?)
&gt;* Zoom in on enemies after activating ability to ""lock on"".
&gt;* 3 / 4 / 5 / 6 bolts launched.
&gt;* To prevent the bolts hitting obstructions in open-spaced areas

* **CHAOS** - 75 Energy

&gt;&gt;*With a powerful psychic blast

&gt;* Duration of 10 / 15 / 20 / 25 seconds. This can be increased with Power Duration (Continuity).
&gt;* Range of 15 / 20 / 22 / 25 in-game meters. This can be increased with Power Range (Stretch).
&gt;* Cost to equip of 6 / 7 / 8 / 9 which is then halved by the Polarity slot
&gt;* Can only be reused only after current effect ends. The current effect can be ended prematurely by killing all affected enemies.
&gt;* Places a green holographic Tenno on affected enemies.
&gt;* Great crowd control ability.
&gt;* Enemies tend to attack the closest available target so it's a reliable ability to use. Unlike Mind Control
&gt;* Stuns enemies for about 2 seconds just like the Mind Control ability upon usage.
&gt;* It can be used effectively on bosses with a group of enemies nearby. 

* **ABSORB** - 100 Energy

&gt;&gt;*Nyx absorbs all incoming damage and channels that collected energy into an explosive radial discharge.*  

&gt;* Does not have a base damage like other Ults.
&gt;* Absorption time of 5 / 7 / 8 / 10. This can be increased with Power Duration (Continuity).
&gt;* Range of 25 in-game meters at all levels. The damage is concentrated around the Tenno
&gt;* Causes a small amount of damage to enemies even if no damage was received while in the absorb state.
&gt;* Cost to equip of 10 / 11 / 12 / 13 which is then halved by the Polarity slot
&gt;* Only reflects the same amount of damage it absorbs.
&gt;* Amazing in solo runs when swarmed by enemies.
&gt;* Can redirect ally damage that hits Nyx onto enemies.
&gt;* As of patch 8.1.3
&gt;* As of patch 7.7.4, whether the enemy is crowded around Nyx or not. As such, no damage will be absorbed as the enemy cannot see Nyx. During solo, the skill works fine still, as there are no teammates to draw enemy attention away.

But the mag as the potental to be a very good frame by doing the following:

- Pull:

1. this needs to be able to pull enemies that are firing at you OVER ledges. Nothing is more disappointing to an a ability that's only function is to pull than for an enemy who is firing at you from above to get caught on the railing he was shooting from. He should be PULLED OVER it.

2. at Max rank you should be able to pull at least 3 or 4 enemies to you. Leveling it up for reach only seems extremely lack luster. Leave friendly pull at 1.

3. Add text stating you can pull friendlies that need revive toward you on the ability. I just learned that from a tip turning a load screen after 30+ hours. This is a big selling point that I didn't even know!

- Shield Polarize:

1. This is User Interfaced based. To help a teammate that has low shields you need to find them and see their health/shields. In a major firefight you cannot even make out most people and that crappy z window doesn't help.

My suggestion on this would be To have an eye shaped shield and health icon above every warframes head that can be seen through walls.

The top would have a blue bar and the bottom red. In the middle would be the suit's class icon (and maybe with an 1 or 2 if multiple of the same type). This should be default with any frame with support

2. Change the power it gives or takes from flat amount to percentage. This would help new players not be so useless to a group and give high level players or use out of it in difficult missions.

With these suggestions the Mag warframe would improve to a good level and not change the class dramatically like i see so many suggest on reddit.",self,t5_2urg0,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1gycgq/as_a_mag_starter_that_has_30_hours_heres_my_mags/

I used the ability and my Dethcube was shooting away at him.  It all seemed to be going fine.  Then he lined up his bow and... His first hit caused me to lose control of my character.

I could still move the camera and though my Dethcube was invisible it was still shooting, couldn't melee, slide, reload, or anything at all.  Eventually even the Dethcube stopped firing and I lost the mission.

 **Infestation Mobs** 

 Infested missions are supposed to be the mild horror element in the game, but it wears off very quickly in the next missions. Now, moving on to the minor gameplay changes: 

* Almost all infested missions should take place in the new Grineer spaceship tileset. The reason behind this is that these ships are already dingy and dark, all infested missions are more of a shooting gallery, hence I think this minor change could make it more interesting

* The general mobs ratio should be different for different tilesets. What I mean by that is, where there must be more runners/leapers/crawlers than chargers. 



**Grineer Mobs**

With the addition of Grataka as staple gun for lancers and Ignis wielding scorches

* As we all know, the delays between the bursts were manageable, giving time for the tenno to dodge and weave through the bullets. But as their level increases, the delay gets shorter to such an extent, that it may seem that they are emptying the clip in one go. This is a serious problem, especially given that the grataka fires damn fast. Hence my suggestion would be to slightly increase the “delay” between bursts for higher level lancers. I feel it is the grataka which makes them dangerous, as they are usually a cakewalk in tower 3 missions where they have dera (I think)



**Corpus Mobs**

Now, we see a lot more crewmen than ordinary MOAs due to obvious gameplay reasons. My suggestions are as follows:

* Only in corpus defense missions

* We know that the corpus don’t use bullets



**Basic Stealth Gameplay**

I wouldn’t talk much on this

* Double XP and damage when stealth kill is performed.

* The console tapping animation of player must be added to the mobs who go to alert the base. 

* Control panels can be hacked to temporarily switch off the lights. When lights are out

* Random distractions

* Mega Xp bonus to the warframe when mission is completed with no alerts and no kills (bonus modified according to mission difficulty)



Well, and this is my feedback on the beta testing of the game.

**TL;DR** : Read the damn thing or GTFO. This post is about minor gamplay modifications which I believe could be implemented via the hotfix updates

You can make difficult enemies without relying on stunlocks. That's just shitty design.

Big Daddies are hard (at least when you first encounter them) but they don't rely on stuns.

Balder Knights from Dark Souls are very fun to fight

The football player enemy in super mario 2 (I think it was 2) was fun and challenging. No stuns!

The Hunters from Halo are excellent

You can challenge the player and make him rethink his current plan without ripping the controls right out of his hands.  You can and should when he does something stupid, then you're doing it wrong.  Warframe shouldn't turn into rainbow six just because the tileset now has scorpions. With Scorpions, the flow is interrupted, and this game is all about flow and finesse.

Games are all about learning patterns and coming up with solutions to new problems, then it's frustrating.

Cliff Racers from Morrowind are a notoriously awful and annoying enemy. No one has ever DIED from a cliff racer, or more interesting, they made walking through foyodas annoying as hell.

I think everyone agrees that warframe needs to be more difficult

I would love to fight enemies that out-ninja me.  The stalker, so you have to utilize your dodge movements to get out of the way while still doing damage to him. He's an EXCELLENT enemy, and he works very well for a rare encounter.  We should have more *bosses* like that.

((Let me stop you right there.  No

does the stalker have a stun? No.  Do you see my point now?  I don't want the game to be homogenous and samey and bland and easy, you must want the game to be fucking COD (because that's the punching bag we're all supposed to use right?)

1369784111.0,1f8e8x,POSSIBLE FIX FOR SMALL CLANS WHEN CONSTRUCTING A DOJO,keahicheveyo,50,21,18,"I've been trying to brainstorm a way of allowing small clans to have similar progress to large ones and have possibly worked out a system in which it would work without possible exploits from jumping between clans.

Firstly it would require some sort of clan bank or vault. Importantly this could only have materials stored and not withdrawn. The only way to spend the resources would be for members with appropriate permissions to use them for dojo architecture and research.

Edit: Seems like there is already going to be a clan vault implemented (how did I miss this?) [vault image
](http://i.imgur.com/HEZWUlY.jpg)


Edit: Just to clarify

_____

Working with that as a basic premise:

* Members can farm resources and have them added to their inventory as per usual
* In addition to resources being added to a players inventory
* The number of resources added to the clan vault scales as a percentage of the clan in your current party (I am aware that this makes 4 person clans the more efficient for farming than 2 and 3 person clans

_____

If you have say a clan of 100 people and they are all farming in clan groups (25 groups). Each group has 4% of the total clan and so every material pickup made by a player will have 4% of that pickup added to the clan vault in addition to the members receiving the full amount of the materials into their inventory.

So if everyone picks up a stack of 100 of a material then you will have 400 added to the clan vault.

Maths:

material amount * number of groups * number of players * percentage to vault = total to vault

100 * 25 * 4 * (4/100) = 400

______

If you have a clan of 4 people and they are farming of a group then your group will have 100% of the clan in your group and so every pickup by a player will add 100% of each pickup to the clan vault in addition to having the full amount to their inventory.

So if everyone picks up a stack of 100 of a material then you will have 400 added to the clan vault

Maths:

100 * 1 * 4 * (100/100) = 400

______

Notes:

* Larger clans will still have more materials available to be donated by players and so the scaling of materials into the vault for small clans may have to be exponential.
* The way I've set this up is just a proof of concept, 12 etc.)

1376757789.0,1kk19v,Improving upon the Endgame - A thorough comparison,Fennyface,33,6,11,"Hello fellow Tennos

--- First the obligatory small disclaimer 

Having reached Level 5 in the game i still greatly enjoy Warframe

Speaking of that I really wondered **how** this really great game (and the endgame in particular) could be improved upon while still thinking about the development effort being necessary. Being a SW tester myself i often think in ""mechanical"" terms and how the word ""fun"" can be combined with ""maintainability"" - the later being things like bugfixing and game-balance of course.

Don't get me wrong here: I love the styling, so i asked myself what do similar games actually do **better** in that regard. And which game should i compare Warframe to?

Surprisingly enough
Now before you now loudly scream at me



**What kept you playing Diablo?** 

I'd sum it up with: Good Co-Op



**What does Diablo actually do better?**

It (D2) surprised me with random amazing loot, as teamplay and character diversity (for me) outweights the actual damage output, as it gives your character a ""role"" and clear purpose. And i think this is exactly the point: 


Warframe - at it's current state - is trying to define ""endgame"" by just having higher damage-numbers and min-maxing your dps-stats to be the best-in-slot. This will inevitably turn into a spiral of ""obsolete"" gear and a steady influx of higher level mobs

Countermeasures to rectify these problems could be the following:

* Mission Variety - If something *""just got interesting""*, these ""events"" could be balanced and randomized rather easily without breaking the whole system apart. 

* Stealth - This is a tough nut, but it really suffers from the reasons mentioned in the next point.

* Conflict - This game has three clashing factions. Why do we see then fighting each other so little? Random encounters on an already-ongoing battle would be something that could really improve the immersion with a relatively low effort.  

* Balance - End-Game enemies in particular tend to just improve in terms of damage output

So how could end-game be improved? 
I'd say: Make higher levels more deadly, thus encouraging the Tenno cell to be fully aware of what mobs do. Also adding more ""random"" strong mobs with a kind of command-aura would be more of a highlight to people (and a demand for focus DPS) instead of throwing tons of identical meatwalls at the Tenno.

Here's my idea:

Now obviously it'd be exactly like the MOAs' rail guns. You can change the color of the beam by changing the energy color. It could be a gun built from the dojo. Either that or you farm parts from T3 towers (which would be much better given the damage I'm thinking it should have).

It could have a charge time like the Lanka. Now here's where it gets fun. The damage should naturally ignore armor. Infinite penetration through walls, just like the MOAs. It could deal **250 damage**. Unmodded. Rank 8 or even 9 requirement. The catch is that every time your character fires the rifle, he stutters like when a runner explodes next to you (not like when it knocks you down completely). It should also have a fairly low ammo pool (just enough to get you through a mission if you're not spamming it). Kinda like how the Gorgon is with ammo.

*But that's only 50 damage above the Lanka! Why the high rank requirement?*

For one, infinite penetration. But lastly, the damage when modded out completely. Let's assume we're running nothing but damage mods (and ignoring enemy multipliers). 

250+(250\*1.65)=662.5

(662.5\*.9)*3+662.5=2451.25

2451.25+(662.5\*.6)=2848.75

**2848.75*2=5697.5 damage. In one shot.**

Not to mention it wouldn't have a travel time and would be instant

&gt;Rhino Skin no longer grants full invincibility

I'm might be a bit biased since i have a Rhino but i believe this nerf was a bit uncalled for. Now its just feels like a slighty different version Overheat (Ember).

In my opinion a more balanced nerf would be switching Iron Skin's slot with Radial Blast

EDIT: People are saying that now Iron Skin no longer protects you against Knockdowns

The site will display only current (active) alerts. It shows what the alert is called, how long it is, and how long is left.  


There is 3 different


* Blue   = Credit only alert

* Red    = Blueprint alert

* Purple = No alerts at this time

Things to note.  First off, this still isn't perfectly accurate, because it's only counting instances, not tracking the amount of time each count is active for.  	

Second, rather than weighting.  So, alerts most likely do happen evenly distributed over all times of day.  

Third

Finally, duration, and credit reward numbers.  
	
As always

	Changelog:
	7/12/2013: Changed planet probability order to sorted by difficulty
	7/15/2013: Narrowed average duration tracking to only ultra-rare and non-ultra-rare
	7/15/2013: Changed all instances of ""Artifact"" to ""Aura"" in the data set
	7/15/2013: Added in display of what hour alerts happen at
	7/16/2013: Modified concurrent() to also track when there are no alerts running. Data is weighted by
            occurances
            each number is active.

Numbers would have to be balanced but I was thinking if credits range from 2000-9600 (highest I've seen. but I will presume 10k is max). So if 2000 credits is base and 10k is max would scale for x5 multiplier on base.

Idea would be to give different multipliers for different rarity of materials so I would keep x5 for common with base of 500 (so you can get lets say 500 ferrite as a reward up to 2500). 200 base for uncommon drops (like lets say alloy plate) with x3.5 max multiplier and 1 base for rares with x3 multiplier max (obviously that would be rare as +8k cash alerts).

I've personally found that a lot of the reward systems in WF to be flawed. For example

A few ideas I had were as such:
- at the end of defense missions, 10 waves = 2 choices, 15 waves = 3 choices, etc.

-Login Rewards: If you get a login reward such as XP when the item the XP was for is maxed out

-Tower rewards: Towers could have a number of rewards based on the tier of the tower and the type of mission. For example

Another idea would be extra rewards based on the mission type. (This idea needs work but I'm just thinking here) Perhaps Defense or Mobile Defense could yield 2 extra choices

These are just ideas that I've come up with while thinking about how difficult it can be to get a single item from a tower or defense mission that you need or want. I want to hear all your takes on the rewards systems in WF and would love to get some feedback

I'm in the process of making a site and designing web apps for warframe players to catalog their weapon builds. Currently I'm getting some decent traffic, and be friendlier in terms of interaction.

I literally just updated the UI and so you'll probably come across a few bugs. If you find some

I'm currently working on making the build builder a little more intuitive and user-friendly instead of 'dropdown boxes' (something similar to the current unofficial Mod Calculator

In any case, there are those of us that don't have those kinds of connections or simply prefer to do it themselves (such as myself.)  That is why I am here.  Please feel free to provide your own input, I'm certainly not the best player here, this is pretty much just how I do it and why. 

* Mission: Fossa

* Equipment: Anything you want to level

Now, and Shockwave Moas.  These units are considered the heavy class of Corpus so each one gives about 270 exp, yet they respawn very quickly and almost infinitely (if you find the correct rooms.) They aren't even any harder to kill than regular Moas.  Fossa also provides you with the Jackal, another great exp boost, and Alloy plate which is used in pretty much everything.  

The general idea is to go into Fossa and use whatever weapon you want to level (or a high powered one, the more Shockwave Moas spawn.  If you find the room with 5 robot spawners (or a smaller room where they are coming frequently) sit in there and wait until no more come out.  You'll probably have to keep moving due to potential low shield amounts and you can't let any of the shockwaves hit you.  I also happen to loot everything while waiting for spawns, but that's not a necessity.

When it comes time to face the Jackal, the boss never has the time to actually hurt you. My current weapon of choice to do this is the Lex, as I know 1-2 shots to take out the leg, 3-4 shots to make it come back up again (with my mods.)  When it comes time to finish him off, down him and switch to the weapon you want to give the exp to and fire away (may take a few tries if the weapon is weak.  Above all, if he happens to get enough time to shoot grenades start running away as fast as possible.  You simply wouldn't survive a hit from them. 

After the Jackal is dead, you can farm it for as long as you want so long as the units keep coming.  There gets to be a point when enemies only rarely spawn or stop all together, and this is a good point to stop and start over.

In the end, it becomes pretty ridiculous.) I haven't found anything that's been as safe or as fast as this when it comes to getting those pre-30 frames up to spec.  But hey, if you guys have, I'd love to hear your opinions and suggestions as well.

I hope this is able to help someone,False,self,t5_2urg0,False,,,t3_19luvh

Boar: Bullet damage type, 2.3 reload time

Sobek deals 250 dmg per second, Boar will reload for 2.3 seconds.  Every 8 seconds, Sobek will reload for 4 seconds.

This means

Boar: 167.44 theoretical sustained damage per second
Sobek: 166.67 theoretical sustained damage per second

Due to the nature of these numbers, since Boar devours it's clip in 2 seconds flat, while Sobek holds out for a total of 8 seconds.  Also, Sobek has a far tighter spread, with Hek's damage falloff, making it far better at mid-range combat.

In a damage type comparison

Conclusion (tl;dr): Sobek is the superior shot-gun except vs. grineer.  Due to Sobek's mid-range capabilities and larger clip-size, and your ideal primary choice.  Boar is still useful as a situational gun due to it's high fire rate and wide pellet spread (ideal for hitting multiple targets with elemental status effects).",,False,self,t5_2urg0,1374797760.0,,

* ""More"" can include any or all of; 1) extra alert duration

* ""More"" appears to be determined by RNG on a table similar to D&amp;D loot tables. IE where the low numbers result in the base

* DE adds in non-random bonus 12 hour alert rewards. This obviously ignores all the above rules. This non-random alert is always after a livestream ends and when the developers want to stress test something. Stress tests are normally on the weekend. Livestreams normally are Tuesdays.

**How can this info help you:**

* **At least one alert should be up at all times. If there aren't any alerts up then a new one will start soon-- Likely in a few seconds

* **If the alert was at 10:37

* **If you check alerts once per 49mins ([twitter alert](https://twitter.com/WarframeAlerts)

* **Always make sure to log in 1 hour after an official livestream. These are announced days in advance via the in game News.**

The thing that sparked my thoughts on this was when assaulting Titania to kill Tyl Regor. Our Lotus dispatch (I surmised that we're from the organization/faction called Lotus) told us that Tyl was one of the leading researchers in Grineer cell regeneration and repair

Here's a dying species who are basically our genetic brothers/sisters

They assault Orokin reactors (Grineer defense) and research the Tenno genetics while we steal our cryosleeping brethren and slaughter Grineer by the hundreds (Mobile defense). From my perspective, and basically keep the dirty Tenno from stealing their research subjects. 

We've come out of cryosleep with no memory,"" underdog space ninjas. 

Also, but seem to be more of a ""project gone wrong"" a la the Zerg in StarCraft.

*However.*



I'm starting to grind my teeth anytime I get put in the *almost* impossible situation of No shields, or sports an artificially extended life expectancy (damage caps seen on Jackal and certain other bosses). 



One of the more frustrating missions I've just finished was a Vampire Mode/No shields fight against Ruk. Don't get me wrong, but played aggressively enough so that I wouldn't lose too much health from dead time between kills. 



The problem came in the form of Ruk's undodgable bullet-magnet bubble that effectively shuts down your killing power for its duration. Naturally I had to resort to melee so that I could maintain my kills to keep my health up



1) I have no shields to prevent pins and needles damage from Grineer hitscan weapons.


2) Grineer are hitscan

3) My health is draining steadily


4) Sargus Ruk's bullet bubble has shut down all of my ranged killing power to prevent health loss for around 10 seconds. He tends to cast this every 30- 40 seconds.



5) Forced into melee to maintain my health reserves



I'm not saying it's impossible to beat the level

I myself am a guy for whom happiness is a belt fed weapon and I feel that guys like me are getting kicked up the *** for that. I know this game revolves around numbers, not to mention the lack of accuracy Gorgon or any of the bullet weapons have towards everything else.

Same goes for Boar, Burston, Lex, Twin vipers and rest of the bullet spewing weapons.

In addition to that what I want to bring up is that this game as title brings it up is lacking ""dakka"" weapons or they need to revisit those for a new damage type (like bullet vs heavy bullet).",self,t5_2urg0,False,,rhino-thrak,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1it90s/not_enuff_dakka/

&gt; 
&gt;Continued growth will create additional technical issues (Consider the scenario of a 7000 person clan all being on at the same time, complications emerge in events like this weekend’s when we want to have fair competition.
&gt; 
&gt;We are implementing something to fix all of this soon. The solution we have creates a new system: Alliances (Coming Soon!). Alliances have unbounded growth with no technical issues. Alliances can have an infinite numbers of Clans. Clans will be divided up by size and can have up to 1000 members.
&gt; 
&gt;The different sized tiers will be as follows:
&gt; 
&gt;* Shadow Clan (up to 10)

&gt;* Mountain Clan (up to 100)

&gt;* Moon Clan (up to 1000)
&gt; 
&gt;Resources required to build Dojo components will multiply by 10 with each tier (i.e. A Shadow Clan needs 1 Ferite
&gt; 
&gt;If you are in a current clan with over 1000
&gt; 
&gt;If your clan is affected by this (presently 13 clans have more than 1000 members, your Dojo will be copied for your new Clan so no work on your original Dojo is lost.

**HEK - TIPS**

* Very effective against the Infested
* Climbing mastery ranks requires leveling many weapons. Mastery rank 4 is equivalent to leveling 2 warframes to level 25 and 10 different weapons to max rank (Or 3 Warframes and 5 weapons to Rank 30).
* Ammo Stock mod rank 0 (+10%) adds no extra rounds to the magazine. Rank 1 (+20%) adds one round to the magazine (for a total 5) and Rank 3 (+40%) adds two (for a total 6). There is no need to upgrade the mod further as no additional rounds will be gained.
* Using the Shotgun Ammo Mutation mod can help regain ammo when needed

Here's my 2 cents:

* PVP: I don't actually want PVP but I'll go ahead and put this here because I imagine it will be the top answer. If you're gonna put PVP please try to give some specifics about what you'd want: 1v1? Capture the flag? Team vs. Team? Some form of oddball or huttball?

* Races: with parkour and dashing I think there's some potential for racing through obstacle courses where the winner gets a reward. You could have a version with no opponents and a version with some opponents

* Mega-boss battles: I'd like to fight giant monsters. What could be better in a game with space ninjas than giant monsters? Not Godzilla/Kaiju size

* Large

* Warframes based on different archetypes. Pretty much every frame is ninjaesque in some respect, Nova, and Ember are more magelike. What about some frames inspired by samurai? Or gunslingers? Or swashbucklers/pirates?

* I know they've said that adding speaking parts for the frames and emotes like dancing are very

Edit: Forgot something really important I'd like to see in the game because it was so obvious. 

* A reduction in the amount of farming and grinding necessary to progress. Some of this is good
     * Make separate drop tables for modules and fusion cores. Basically mods would still have a drop table of all modules like it is now. There would be a separate

     * Add or create an area in the game specifically to farm fusion cores. It sucks sometimes to have to use copies of the same mod to level one up especially if they're rare. Maybe somewhere in the solar system there is a factory that makes fusion cores guarded by legions of robots who are also powered by fusion cores? When you kill them they don't drop any modules but have a higher chance to drop fusion cores.

     * Increase the drop rates of modules and/or decrease the requirements to level high level modules. There are so many modules in the game that the chance of getting any particular one to drop is very slim. This makes it difficult to use copies of the same mod to level something up. Also the requirements to level things like redirection, they're insane. As in ""if you are willing to spend the time to actually acquire the resources to level even one of these all the way up there is probably something wrong with you and you'd be much better off to stop playing altogether and go outside for a bit"" insane. At some point doubling the requirements every level should cut off and just add 8 or 16 more. ",,False,self,t5_2urg0,1375981444.0,,
1374730804.0,1j0efh,Snipetron Vandal Vs. Lanka,Ithloniel,25,3,14,"I have seen a DPS comparison of the two on reddit before

Lanka:
Serrated Blade, 1.5 second charge time

Snipetron Vandal:
Armor Piercing

This means Snipe-V deals 187.5 dmg per second

With 60% Fire Rate bonus

Snipe-V deals 300 dmg per second while Lanka deals 275 dmg per second.

So yea... Snipetron Vandal is just better DPS-wise.  Big thanks to Nar0 for correcting my fire rate numbers. :D

The big thing for Lanka really comes down to ammo efficiency.  Lanka at max Wildfire + Warp Mag has 15 rounds

Wintermute24: ""Semi auto weapons like the svandal get their fire trigger slightly buffered by the game if you press the trigger just in the small time window before a shot may be fired again - so you can actually reach the listed fire rate. The Lanka, but you can never reach it.""

Going this route could also drastically increase host client performance on Kappa and Kiste

People also don't have to be playing the game for others to get into a match. We've all sat there for 5+ minutes with the 'Play Now' button blinking at us, even those not playing the game (and thus having fewer available sessions) could still allow games to be played off their connection even without Warframe running, and without their participation in the mission.

* blueprints

I really think that this would change these side missions for the better and not have everybody hate Lotus for trolling us mid-mission and making us destroy the OTHER fusion core or capture ANOTHER hostage

EDIT: ~~in light of Foundation12's post there could either be a system where you vote to leave or stay, well the point of these new objectives is that it would be like stalker, people would be excited over the fact that they have a chance at getting something rare. So I thought maybe the people that didn't want to proceed with these side objectives could instead go towards the Orange mission completion objective and just *disconnect* per say, while still receiving all the credits and anything they would have gotten in the main objective.

I would like to highlight this statement:

Note that armor does not apply to shields which take 200% damage from ice attacks and 100% from everything else.

Basically, which would make the skill last significantly longer.

The problem is that I can not actually test if the absorb bubble from Iron Skin is applied first (so modifiers like Armour would never apply to it even when you are out of shields)

If Iron Skin is indeed just an ""extra shield"" of 800 points that takes 100% damage from all sources,,False,self,t5_2urg0,False,,True

Had to audible. Only got four usable rounds for Phase 1 yesterday as I failed to make screenshots of the post-match report for the fourth round. 

Had to change up the plan again when I was pressed for time today, almost losing the objectives on several occasions.

Now normally you'd think it was a problem with the connection, they just wouldn't target me. I could kill crates and pick up items, although I couldn't open lockers.

We were on Skype, or cast a decoy in front of them, and they would see it update instantly.

The fact we were both on Skype made it still playable, I had to instruct him on where to go, which doors to open, and when. I'd run ahead to kill enemies perched against corners, waiting to ambush him, and just round balconies to kill those trying to snipe.

Right now we have a bunch of different weapons that are very similar with small differences in stats. We have cosmetic weapon skins like the Dagger Axe skins as well as stat skins like the Brok Hammer for the Fragor.

I can't help but feel that weapons like Heat Dagger and Dark Dagger could have been stat changing skins for the Ceramic Dagger this entire time, while still giving people some variety in appearances and function.

For free players it means they are less dependant on weapon slots in order to obtain a variety of similar weapons. This could hurt DE in terms if income from weapon slot purchases

My apologies, which take significantly reduced damage in all locations except their weak points which can not always be targeted. As such i am asking mostly what would be the best weapons to bypass enemy armor resistances. The armor pen/ignore are the obvious choices but i was wondering whether there may be some special effects like the Ogris which seems very popular but beyond my understanding as to why since it is nor armor ignore damage.
