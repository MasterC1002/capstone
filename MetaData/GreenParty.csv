We have to show up and support our candidate Nov. 6th and show other Americans that we are here.

Obviously our victories come at the local level for now. But it's important to show our collective numbers nationwide by supporting our candidate Stein for President.

If any of you are like me and have been playing the tug of war in your mind between voting Stein and risking a Romney win or giving in to voting Obama,  and back and forth we'll go. The truth of the matter is that while Democrats may make better strides than Republicans for peace and the environment, they don't do enough. And they do NOTHING to stop the money in politics and the two party domination - which is what prevents American from making real strides in peace and the environment. The Democrats act like they're our side but they're still *actively* maintaining the system that holds us hostage!

It's time for the Green Party to rise. We - the voters - are the ones that will make that happen by coming out for Jill Stein on Nov. 6th. And by supporting and promoting Greens at the local level at every election. Even running ourselves if there are none already!

**I want to assure you that this is the one and only political email I will send this election season.** If you're already offended by a political email

**Last night Larry King moderated a third party debate with four candidates: Dr. Jill Stein (Green Party), and Virgil Goode (Constitution Party).** These candidates have been specifically prohibited from debating with President Obama and Governor Romney, but I give many thanks to Larry King for lending his name to the cause of Democracy and giving these four an opportunity to debate. After all, these four are qualified presidential candidates appearing on essentially every single state ballot this year. What kind of democracy only invites two out of six candidates to debate?

**Here is a link for you to watch the Third Party Debate hosted by Larry King in its entirety: http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/2012/10/watch-a-livestream-of-the-full-third-party-presidential-debate.html**  This was truly the most pure display of Democracy I've ever seen; I don't think it is overly emotional to admit to you that I teared up a little at the sight of it. For anybody who has rolled their eyes at our current political system


The full debate is an hour long

- Get the money out of politics by **passing a Constitutional Amendment that clarifies that money is not speech and corporations are not people.** Political campaigns should be publicly financed so that all Americans have an equal opportunity to serve the public

- **Include a 4 year college degree as part of the basic free education we give to all our American children** so that they have the skills they need to be productive in the work force. This may seem radical but it isn't. We've done with before with members of the military who came back from WWI and it paid out $7 in increased economic productivity for every $1 we invested into their college education. Most of Europe already gives their students a university education free; it works. Currently in America we supply K-12 education; imagine if students had to pay for a basic K-12 education. Imagine if high school graduates were strapped with student loan debt just from attending high school. THAT would be radical. But that is exactly what is happening to those who obtain a college degree

- **Restore the Constitutional rights of Americans to privacy and a fair trial.** President Obama and Governor Romney won't touch these topics (unless it is to take away our rights), text messages, facebook posts and more are all accessible to the government. These are all facts, as impossible as they may seem, and a simple google search will confirm all of the above.

- **Stop our overseas interventions.** We are creating more enemies than we had before by continuing to be involved in the middle east. Look, then it is the weight of the world coming down on that country - not just America. The country can't retaliate against the entire world. But currently, with it just being America that polices these nations, the nations CAN retaliate against America - and they do. **We're using drones to kill specific enemy targets, but these drones literally bomb weddings, funerals, restaurants, these are facts that a google search will confirm. Leave policing the world the U.N. and put American resources back into America - we desperately need them.

- **Stop climate change.** Even our own U.S. Pentagon admits that climate change is the #1 issue facing America and the world today. We have to stop pretending it doesn't exist

- **End the failed war on drugs. The war on drugs is a leading cause of poverty in America.** In poor communities, and we lose out on millions of dollars of tax revenue. Marijuana, and the proper and safe use of marijuana, is a public health issue and should be taken out of the hands of the criminal justice system all together. (Note: Stein, Johnson and Anderson agree on this point; Goode does not support the legalization of marijuana.)

- **There are 90 million eligible voters who choose not to vote. That is more than those who will actually vote. Those people are saying NO to politics as usual.** They are saying that neither the Republican nor the Democratic party actually represents them. But to those people

President Obama and Governor Romney rarely talk about any of the issues above, and equality for all. They will pull America out of debt, out of our overseas interventions, and out of the global impending climate crisis.

I do not think Stein or Johnson will win in 2012, Democrats and Republicans, are exactly the same.** The most difference you'll find between the two is on things such as marriage equality, funding for Planned Parenthood, and who should pay more taxes - the wealthy or all of us. But those items are not real change! No matter who wins out of those two, our lives will not be different. We'll still see our young people starting their careers with debt. We'll still see people locked behind bars for marijuana possession. We'll still see our troops (and monetary resources) spent overseas. We'll still see terrorists hating on America because we're killing their innocent citizens with drones. We'll still see a dependence on oil and energy sources that hurt our planet. We'll still see wealth disparity among Americans. We'll still see candidates at every level bought and controlled by corporations. **We'll still have a political system that works for corporations and special interests; not Americans.** 

**I am voting Jill Stein on November 6th.** The only wasted vote is a vote that is placed for a candidate you don't actually believe in. If you've never voted before I invite you to look into Dr. Stein or Gov. Johnson (or Anderson or Goode - though they don't have the following that Stein and Johnson have). I suspect you'll like what you see. There's no reason to be cynical about politics when your politicians are honest and answer to you. www.jillstein.org  www.garyjohnson2012.com

**Finally, 6:00pm PST. You'll be able to watch it live at freeandequal.org/live**

Peace and Love (and Vote!)

1352586101.0,12zd63,Let's set some realistic goals for expanding the Green Party.,exatreide,36,3,20,"We did not win this election

1. Fielding presidential candidates is an expensive time consuming process. The majority of money is spent on ballot access. What's left is not enough to to seriously challenge the major parties. 

2. We will never poll high enough to enter the debates. This is just a fact. 

3. The two party system is not going anywhere soon on a presidential level. 

What I think we should do.

1. Plan, and fix websites so they don't look like they were produced in the late 90's. 

2. Abandon the Presidential campaign for the moment. Were not going to win

3.  Micro target demographics. The youth, and pull liberals away from the Democratic party. Tell them why the Green party is better. If you can't tell someone why they should vote Green instead of voting Democrat, you don't deserve to have anyone elected.

4. Work with Labor. As the Democrats shift slowly to the center and the right; labor still supports them.  We need to reach out and prove that Greens are better for Labor then the Democrats.  With this, comes elections. (Until we get citizens united repealed, this is something we have to deal with)

5. Throw money into winnable campaigns. What's better? Pouring limited resources into campaigns that we can't win. Or focusing funds on a handful of locations where we have a shot at winning. Elect a state rep, it will have more of an impact than a dozen failed candidates.



6. Coalition with other third party groups. This started a little this year, coalition candidates.


6. Don't give up. Things can only look up from where were at.

Another individual was a bit eccentric, and other things).  He told me he (who is 54 years old) has never voted before because he doesn't believe in it.  But by the end of our conversation, he seemed excited to visit Jillstein.org and read up on her and I think his first ever vote may be cast for Stein because of me!  That's a great feeling.

Are you a reluctant Obama voter?  Or a reluctant Romney voter?  Are you voting ""against"" a candidate almost as much as for a candidate?  Are you confused as to why abortion and gay marriage should decide (or be decided by) your views on economic policy?  Do you feel that neither party really represents what's important to you?  Tired of the broken politics of two factions who hate each other?    
    
If you are sick of the two party system
    
**1.  Identify which of the two major candidates you are reluctantly voting for (or which candidate you are voting against).    
2.  Find somebody you trust who ""supports"" the other candidate
3.  Make an agreement that you will BOTH vote third party.       
(Optional step 4)  Both of you agree to go find two OTHER people to make the same deal
    
Since your original votes would have canceled each other out, but now you can vote for something meaningful.    
    
(How much you ""trust"" the other person should probably depend if you live in a swing state or not.  If you live in a narrow swing state, parent, best friend, whatever.  If you live in a landslide state, you should be safe finding strangers on reddit to make a voting pact with.)    
    
No third party candidate is actually going to win this election
    
In the long run, that would be a big help in building a future where we have more choices.  
    
Even if you really love Obama or Romney, and you can still support the idea of having choices.

I am not any of those descriptions. I'm 27yo, not an environmentalist but hates unnecessary waste. I believe some recycling programs worsens the environment/economy, ie paper recycling. I'd rather grow new trees (aka oxygen) rather than have a dumpster truck (aka CO2) come to my house a collect my used papers. My tax dollars should goto solar/alt fuel/EV subsidiaries rather than recycling paper. I don't make enough money to be a tree hugger, but I would love to lower my electric/heating bills and enjoy clean air.

The [10 key values](http://www.gp.org/tenkey.shtml) doesn't really describe tree huggers. I believe key value #9 is part of #10. **Ending Corporate Personalhood** should be a key value:

I believe companies DO NOT have the right to make their employees/community sick. And companies DO NOT have the right to cut corners to make more money by sacrificing or endangering the lands we live on

Also War is a big waste of taxpayers' money. If we can be self sustainable then we can avoid wars. If we're not investing in wartime

I wouldn't call the 10 key values 'green' views. It's very progressive and promoting our near future. Believe it or not

But most of all I would like for us to keep an open dialogue on the Green Party platform so that it can be revised if necessary and made more accessible to potential new Greens.

Excerpt: 

&gt;Action Plan

&gt;So what do we do?

&gt;1. Expand our avenues of political expression: First

&gt;2. Refuse to let politicians use social issues to exploit us economically: We also need to reject the exploitation and manipulation of progressive values by corporatist politicians who use social issues like gay marriage and reproductive rights exactly the way Republicans do – to manipulate their own base into ignoring their own economic interests. Politicians who don’t take a stand on economic issues should be rejected

&gt;3. Explain what is changing – and contrast what is with what should be:  We need to do a better job of explaining what’s happening, if we can find the political will.

&gt;4. Expand the vocabulary of the possible: The “learned helplessness” outlook says “the rich and powerful always win; we don’t stand a chance.” History tells us otherwise.  From the American Revolution to the breaking up of the railroads, we need to remind ourselves of what we’ve accomplished under similar conditions.

&gt;5. Tell stories: And we need to tell stories – human stories. That’s why Tuesday night’s Bill Moyers special on PBS is so important. “Two American Families” tells the story of a white family and an African-American family in Milwaukee over two decades. Their stories bring home

&gt;To explain, to tell stories is to begin the process of political change. As Paolo Friere said, “To speak a true word is to transform the world.”",,False,self,t5_2rgbf,,http://www.reddit.com/r/GreenParty/comments/1hxyb0/where_the_hell_is_the_outrage_commondreamsorg/

There was [a link in this subreddit yesterday](http://www.reddit.com/r/GreenParty/comments/1dhmu2/england_wales_local_elections_green_party_fields/) about the English and Welsh greens fielding the largest number of candidates in its history in the local elections yesterday and today. Most English counties are having council elections

(Oh, results for two more councils have come in - more about those later, then.) 

The biggest news is [the imposing surge of support for the UK Independence Party](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/ukip-hails-sea-change-in-british-politics-as-it-dents-tory-grasp-on-county-councils-8601966.html)

**Green Party results so far**

I'm neither a Brit nor a Green party activist, when I looked this morning, the Greens had won three council seats in seven counties, which isn't much, really - it was about 1% of the total number of elected councillors. But it compared to just 1 councillor in the same counties the last time they were up.

Those three council seats were won in the **[Gloucestershire county council](http://glostext.gloucestershire.gov.uk/mgElectionResults.aspx?ID=3&amp;RPID=32661477)**, where they won 5% of the vote and two of the 75 seats, up from zero.

The Gloucestershire county seat they won was [for Stroud Central](http://glostext.gloucestershire.gov.uk/mgElectionAreaResults.aspx?ID=101&amp;RPID=32579286), 15% to the Tory candidate, and 14% to the UKIP candidate. Sounds like a pretty left-wing seat.

One of the Essex county seats they won was [in Rochford West](http://www.akserps.com/aksessex/election/2013/row.html)

The other Essex seat they won was [in Witham Northern](http://www.akserps.com/aksessex/election/2013/win.html). James Edward Abbott (what a very English name) won with just 26% of the vote in a fragmented four-way field. The UKIP and Conservative candidates both got 25% and the Labour candidate 21%.

**Strategy?**

It strikes me that the LibDems are wholly marginalized in these seats. In the article which was linked in this subreddit yesterday, incinerators, landfill sites and roads"":

&gt;Natalie Bennett, it's about 20mph zones near schools, hospitals, parks or play areas,"" she said. ""In other areas, it's about planning protections or development of green spaces.""

Thank you

Now

This is a democracy; in democracies you have to get up, you may have to yell louder, or get arrested at a bank protest. In some cases, people will only listen to you because someone on your presidential ticket appeals to them.

Many never would have heard of the Green Party if it weren't for Jill Stein. 

The reason a lot of local Green elected officials (yes

In other words, you can see how this dynamic works.


Also

That's because voters want to support their presidential candidate, presidential candidtates are critical for turnout.

So to say ""Stein is wasting her time

The only reason we are having this discussion about local candidates is because Dr. Stein is such a strong national candidate who has brought attention to potential victories local races. McKinney and Cobb were never as strong as her.

And yes, county council, and mayor (http://www.greenpartywatch.org/2012/03/15/56-green-candidates-campaigning-for-office-in-texas/). The question is, are you supporting your Green school board, city council, county council, or mayoral candidates? Do you even know who they are? Do you have Google? How are you helping them?


How can a local candidate get federally matched funds? Do you realize that Stein's matching funds are being used for local ballot access goals? The local candidates wouldn't even be on the ballot in states like PA if it weren't for resources from the national presidential campaign being funnelled for local use.


This is not an easy thing to do. How many states does the supposedly more ""experienced"" Rocky Anderson have ballot access in? With all her fame and connections



I hate to break it to you guys, you are in the wrong place. 

A vote for Greens is a vote for resistance. 

It is a vote for ""none of the above."" 

It is a vote for obstructing the status quo of the corporate state. 

It is a vote for raising awareness that there is another way.

Getting elected to the CEO position of the United Corporations of America is not the goal here. 

Your vote is a protest vote. 

I have never heard of an anti-war protester or an Occupier who said ""We've been out here all day

This is the mentality of paralysis. This mentality would have killed just about every successful socio-political movement from day one.


Not voting

If you think that making your voice heard is a waste of time


**TL;DR**

*Presidential campaigns get local candidates on the ballot, and get local candidates media attention. Voters mainly turn out for presidential votint, which coattail off to local candidates, not the other way around. Do you even know who your local candidates are?*

*Voting Green for president has other goals besides being in charge of a corrupt government. It is mainly about resistance and protest
