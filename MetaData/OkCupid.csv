1361164253.0,18qghf,I'm at the coffee shop and there is a first date taking place beside me. Right now! And she is GRILLING THIS BASTARD!,okeliedokeliecupid,1206,164,374,"I'm at the coffee shop and there is a first date taking place beside me. I don't recognize her from OKcupid or Pof though. And this girl is grilling this poor guy. I feel bad for him. 

First she goes on some homophobic rant asking why he lives in the gay district (lots of people live there because it's cheaper).

She: Where do you live?

He: Charles

She: Charles what's Charles?

He: It's South downtown

She: There's a Charles STREET. Do you live there?

He: Yeah

She: That's where all the... uh... the uh... different people live.

...and then she's just firing off question after question... these are only a FEW of the excerpts of intense grilling...

She: So have you dated people online?

He: This is actually my first date in 5 months.

She: Why do so many guys say that. I was just dating a few other guys saying I haven't dated for 3 months
months

He: ...uhm..

She: So you're Brazilian?

He: Yes..

She: You don't look Brazilian. You look like you're something else.

He: Well my dad is Japanese and my mom is Italian. 

She: I knew there was something! Cuz I have a friend who is Brazilian and you don't even look Brazilian...

He: But I was born and raised in Brazil..

She: But still. I was asking about your nationality.

*...*

She: So Brazil there's a lot of sex there?

He: uh..not really..

She: Yeah there's a lot

He: a little

She: like on the beach and stuff

He: It's not unheard of..

She: The only thing is you have to be careful and stuff..

He: ..careful?

She: Yeah of the men. There's a lot of women who are really men.

He: laughs

She: No really the same happens in Thailand. Lots of girls people have sex with turn out to be men.

*...*

She: How long were you with your ex?

He: 9 years 

She: 9 years! (the kid looks like he's early 20s so I was surprised too)

He: Yeah but we're just friends now.

She: So you still talk?

He: Well yeah it was 9 years ...so..

She: So you still talk. Hm. Interesting.



*...*



She: So you're like a software developer?

He: Yeah it's like.. uh..

She: .. Not nerdy?

He: Uh yeah.. but a lot of computer work

She: Did they accept your education here?

He: Yeah

She: Really because usually when people come from a different country they have to start all over.

*....*

She: So you're dad is Japanese?

He: Yeah.

She: Like totally Japanese?

He: Yeah

She: Like the ones I see in the movies?

He: Yeah like fully Japanese.

She: So do you eat sushi?

He: No

She: I love sushi. My mom says I should marry a Japanese guy because I eat so much sushi.

He: I'm not that big of a fan.

She: So then what do you EAT?

*...*

**UPDATES:**

She: There's a lot of software developpers here.. they're kind of weird... late at night.. minimal life.. they're like a cult.

He: hmm

She: Its not good you need a balance right?

He: (he must be embarrased cuz I can't hear a single thing he's saying now but she's loud)

*...*

She: It's not difficult for me to get a job. I'm glad I went to school for business. Keeps doors open.

He.   *muttering*

She: [goes through her day.. shopping/business..]

*...*

She: so yeah do you like the site?

He: What site?

She: Dating site?

He: ..mutters something about problems with filters (lol

She: So what are you looking for then?

He: Common interests

She: Like swimmers?

He: Uh.. yeah I like swimming

She: lots of swimmers live here.

He: oh

SHe: My bf would love swimming i'd be like ""yeah go have fun"" ..and like i can go shopping while he does it..

*...*

She : I think you got to find someone with commonality and physical attraction

He: yeah

She: thats imporant right? physicallity? attraction? IT IS! Right?

He: yeah

She: and then other stuff.. nice guy.. sense of humour.. likes animals. Someone who is independent has their own 
place. Good job good career. Good family. Stuff liek that. 

He: Someone who cares about the same things?

She: Yeah. Definitely! Like someone with values and morals.

*...*


Dude's handling it like a champ. He knows this ain't no job interview. Relax.



.. it took 30 minutes but he finally made her chuckle once. I missed the joke though.



This shit is happening too fast to type.. if anything more comes out I'll update..


*...*


She: This city is hard to find good guys

he: what do you mean?

she: like gentleman.. someoen who treats you right

he: how?

she: like holds doors for you. you don't see that. 

he: well there some guys to meet.

she: no like a guy should pick up the girl

he: well..

she: no you're mom should have told you that. i'm not dating someone who takes the bus . I want someone on my level. i'm a girl. i think a guy would be very similar. 

*....*

she: girls should not be paying

he: well half half is best

she: no.. thats not how it works

he: ok

she: you asked me out.. so that means you're paying. If i asked you out.. I'D be paying

he: ok

she: so if i have a car and you don't

he: no

she: do you think that's fair?

he: no


she: so you're not paying for gas either.. so is that fair?

he: no

she: that's what I thought. Even though we're girls .. we need to be treated like women. we need to be treated like your sister.


he: [he makes a case about how two people should be equal.. can't hear it all..]

she: 50/50.. that's what i said. But if you invite someone to dinner man should pay

he: no it should be 50/50

she: no you are so wrong! you know why women pay half? because they 'll never want to see that guy again. my brother

he: no not always

she: not always.. but if you invite her you MUST pay. I know a lot of girls who will bounce if you don't

he: well the girl should help. 

she: [laughs at him] 

he : its like women rights

she's : its not about women rgiths. its about treating a women

he"": no cuz then a man has to buy everything like a car and a house..

she: no both people should have cars

he: so...

she: if you ask a girl out and dont pay.. i cant believe this is the mentality you guys have... you've been brainwashed... look 90% of the time she'll leave

he: what do you mean ""you guys"" i'll pay sometimes

she: no this the mentality you have.. flowers? you not going to buy flowers now? omg they'll die what a waste of tiem...[laughs at him]... 

OMG THEY BOTH STOOD UP AND ARE DEBATING THIS SHIT OUT LOUD

he: no its about  50/50 

she: 50/50 is everything and between.. like 2 cars .. you're not a man and not being a gentleman.. I am SHOCKED SHOCKED that you even think this way!

he: i am a gentleman

she: no you think woman are dirt.. admit it.. you think they're dirt

he: no i never said that

..NOW THEY WALKED OUTSIDE AND ARE DEBATING THIS THERE..  the guy beside me looked at me and was like ""i never heard so many fucking generalizations in an hour.. that guy needs a medal putting up with that shit.""

Now we're waiting to see if she hits him.... shit got so intense! but I can't hear anything 


Ok now they separated. Didn't see a slap like we expected. But it did get scary. Sorry about the grammar but at the end it became like rapid fire back and forth and could only type the best parts as fast as I could.

Irony was the dude was pretty much the gentleman. I don't blame him for losing it a bit in the end and letting her make him lose his cool. He's probably thinking he went along letting her spew garbage and now he's being called ""dirt"" in a coffee shop. About 20 people here. I hope most of them knew what it was about.",self,t5_2rct2,1361212865.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/OkCupid/comments/18qghf/im_at_the_coffee_shop_and_there_is_a_first_date/

When I showed up he seemed great. He was nice and friendly

As soon as we started chatting it became evident he had a very specific life plan and was basically looking for a wife on OkCupid (which is fine if that's what you want). He began asking for my opinions on shared bank accounts and how long I thought people should be together before they got married. It was a bit awkward

He started telling me all about how he's *really* into martial arts (which is fine) and how he'd want 'his kids' to get into it too

So far

Then, right?' - which is, in my opinion, a totally inappropriate question to ask someone on a first date. But, I answered honestly that I have Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), and that while I can conceive it *may* be more difficult for me. Given that it was the first time we met, I didn't feel he needed any more personal information on the matter. 

Things instantly changed. He said

&gt;*All good down there..........*

I was absolutely blown away by how callous his response was. I get that for some people

I put a $20 on the table

Anways he asked to meet and work on the boss fight together. It was an interesting request and very different from other messages I got. I thought ""why the fuck not?"" So I picked Shake shack. He paid for my meal since I was helping him. We literally worked on the boss fight for the majority of the time. We did end up chit chatting about different things and having stuff in common. At the end we both said we had a good time and I said casually we'll do this again. The date felt really awkward and I felt no chemistry. I had no intention of seeing him again even though I said I would. So a few days later he texts me asking to go out. I decided ""why not? I should just give him another chance.""

So for the second date we ended up getting drinks and dinner and then watch Pacific rim. For some reason this time everything felt different. The drinks opened us up a little more and I had changed my mind about him completely. There now was chemistry. He walked me to my door after the date and kissed me. :-) We made plans to see each other again.

Last night was our 3rd date. He picked me up and gave me a single red rose. He took me to a fancy italian restaurant. We spent 20 minutes consulting with the waiter about which bottle of red wine to order. After that we discussed our future plans in life and interests. We talked about the videogames that we can play over and over again and never get sick of them. After dinner we went to a dive bar and got drinks and talked more. Then we walked to his car and then proceeded to makeout against the car for sometime and everything clicked for me chemistry wise. 

I'm pretty happy :). We're planning our 4th date on friday and I can't wait. I'm really glad I gave him a second chance :-).

He came over last night and we went and got a bottle of wine

&gt; Him: I wrote a book that's coming out soon.

Me: Oh that's neat

&gt; Him: I don't want to read it. I'm sorry

----

&gt; Him: Not to sound egotistical

----

&gt; Him: Are you wearing makeup on your eyebrows?

Me: Yeah

&gt; Him: Wow

**[Proceeds to reach across the bar and rub one of my eyebrows]**

&gt;Him: I'm not very good at giving compliments

Me: Yeah

&gt;Him: It's just that pretty girls are like cats and if you give them attention, they'll be rubbing all over your pants.

----

&gt; Him: You know

Me: Noted.

1364299006.0,1b1bne,My most recent and most likely last OkCupid experience.,castlesandcrowns,514,78,226,"Let me preface this by saying I'm not an amazing story teller

So in late January I have a week long texting conversation and really seem to hit it off with a beautiful, not a bit of awkwardness or dead air. We end up spending 7 hours wandering aimlessly while we talk about everything. Family, Friends, Goals, Job, etc. It progresses from there into a second date, a third date

I meet all her friends, and one other single boring awkward guy who really doesn't interact with me or anyone at all much.   

So this progresses onward for the next month or so. We go on about 5 or 6 Dinner dates, all that jazz, etc. We speak daily via text, always a good morning, a good night. It seems like it's going places but wasn't quite at the ""exclusive talk"".    

All of a sudden she begins getting a bit vague in texts
Day or so later I ask her what night she'd like me to come by. No response. I'm not one to push at it so another day or so passes and I haven't talked to her so I shoot her a simple message to see whats up. No response.  
I see her posting invites to some ""secret surprise spur of the moment"" party that no one has a clue what is. I'm at work and don't bother to attempt to even ask her about it.    

Three hours later on Facebook pictures of her in a wedding dress and  a picture of a bouquet are posted and made into her display picture and cover photo. All her friends congratulating her and saying she's so ""random"". She literally got married. Remember that single guy roommate that I mentioned earlier? Yeah that's now her husband as of a few hours ago. She never really mentioned him as anything more than her roommate or even mentioned him much at all when we spoke of exes or past hookups. So she got married about 5 days after we saw each other last.  
I shot her a text basically with a ""wtf?!"" and have yet to get a response.

I had been talking to this girl for a while, and I had a gig last night, so we decided to meet after that.  I felt like I knew this girl pretty well after some pretty long conversations spanning about 2 weeks, and we both were fairly avid cannabis users, so we decided to just meet somewhere and smoke.  

I get to the parking lot where we agreed to meet and jump in her car.  We smoke, so I suggest we go get something to drink.  We go to this convenience store and she decides she's going to wait in her car.  I run in, grab a drink, come out and she is gone.  She made off with an 1/8th of weed, my bubbler, and my fucking car keys.  

It's 11:30, I'm 30 minutes from my house, and I find that one of my fucking windows was open. I get in my car (thankfully I left it unlocked), and try to get in touch with her.  The rain is soaking me though my cracked window and I'm fucking freezing. She won't answer my calls or texts, I tried to send her a facebook message, but she just unfriended and blocked me.  I thought about sending her an okcupid message (she was online), but it's hard enough to get girls to respond even before they rob you

So

Edit:  She dropped the keys off at a nearby(near her, but I learned some very valuable lessons and a little bit of humility.  

As fun as it is to think about some ""petty revenge"" and other retaliatory fantasies

1343060636.0,x0sof,Some advice from a 30 year old man who has been on and off OKC since 2004,jmking,266,42,81,"I wanted to take some time and offer some advice from the perspective of someone who has been on the site since it opened in 2004. I don't claim to be a ""professional"" when it comes to online dating

I've met several serious long term girlfriends (one of which was a fiancee at one point), and a few flings along the way for good measure.

The first and most important tip I want to give is this:

**If you wrote a good message and she didn't reply

I know this one is hard

For instance, I typically try to focus my attention on one person at a time. This is pretty typical among women as well.

To those that feel that women owe you at least a rejection note back, they've just played it safe and stopped replying. This is simply the convention of online dating - don't take it personally.

**There is an ebb and flow of activity based on the time of year**

The ""best"" time for online dating is typically spring and early summer. People want to get out and have fun, don't get discouraged.

**Timing is everything**

Based on the first two points here - if she's been on the site for more than 2 weeks, and is probably already sort of seeing someone. Keep an eye on who's new in addition to just match percentages.

**Don't let the red dot discourage you**

Most of the people I message have the dreaded red dot on their profile indicating that they ""rarely reply"". Most of the time this isn't necessarily their fault - they just get lots of shitty one-liner messages. The more attractive the women

**Start a conversation

When writing a first message, follow it up with something like ""I really loved Blair Witch Project because...."". This is a conversation starter - it gives her something to reply to that's easy, and potentially something to ask you back that's related to what you shared.

Also, make sure it's a conversation opener. ""Hey, I really like that tattoo of a bluebird - the art is fantastic. Is that your design, or did you have someone draw it for you? I've been thinking about getting one on my thigh...""

Keep it relatively short. She should be able to read it and feel like she could reply right away without having to sit on it and dwell on how much work it'll be to respond to your essay. Keep it to 3 or 4 points and wrap it up.

**Don't write a novel in your profile

There is a balance between writing too much, movies - everyone likes this stuff. Be more specific, don't be afraid to talk about niche things you're into.

Don't write demands or passive aggressive accusatory crap in your profile either. Stuff like ""If you smoke

Don't talk about how you're funny or witty. Simply BE funny or witty.

My main summary is in point form. Short, funny etc)

**Look happy in your profile pictures**

Unless you're crazy attractive

Happy people want to be with other happy people.

If you have a pet

**Arrange to meet after a handful of messages**

Do NOT spend weeks in messages back and forth. It's tedious and a waste of time. A small handful of back and forth is more than enough to establish that she's interested. If she declines

In my early days I tried to move the conversation to IMs and talked on there for a while before meeting, in my experience it's a lot easier to just go meet up. This might be something that is easier to do with women in their mid-20s and older. Younger women may be more wary of meeting up, so depending on your age, your milage may vary.

Avoid asking for her phone number until you have a first date planned. Don't ask for her Facebook or anything like that either. I find this can come across as creepy and intrusive. Then again

**If you have a typical 9-5 job

This is my one dating pro-tip I can offer. The weekday lunch date is the best first date because it has a time limit. You have around an hour to dip out of work and grab a bite. If there's no chemistry, going... because.... ""

If it goes really well

**Don't Give Up!**

Take a break if you need to, and while most of them didn't turn into long term relationships, that's OK! It was still a worthwhile experience, and I'm often better off for having known them :)

Try to stay positive!

1338826965.0,ukdtp,Stood up for the first time; made the most of it,aryabhata,245,32,64,"I was stood up for the first time last week. I don’t mean she canceled at the last minute—I mean she just didn’t show and I haven’t heard from her since. I’ve read complaints here on r/OkCupid about this happening

So I made the most of it. I went across the street from the park where I’d been waiting to a bar that was going to have live music in a little while, a woman came in by herself and sat down in a chair about 15 feet to my left. As I drank my beer, I noticed that she was checking her phone and occasionally looking around. I resolved that when I finished my drink, I’d go over and introduce myself; then I did. I asked her if she was meeting someone.

It turned out she had been stood up as well, nominally based here in Boston but actually living somewhere else, so this was a new place for her. After talking for about an hour, we left to walk around and find something else to do. Eventually we made our way to one of my favorite restaurants, a little Tunisian place hidden on a side street. Then I drove her home, and we made plans for the next day.

She’d said she wanted to get out of the city and see the surrounding area. But she’d be on call for work from 3 AM to 3 PM and couldn’t go too far from the airport during that span. So we agreed that if she wasn’t called up then she’d let me know, and we headed north to check out the coast of New Hampshire and southern Maine. We explored for seven hours, and during that time the conversation never flagged. When I dropped her off back at her house by the airport, we both agreed we’d had an amazing time, and she said she’d let me know when she’d be back in town. She got a call at 3:45 AM the next morning to fly out. Now I’m wondering when (if?) I’ll hear from her again. I like her.

Why did I post this whole story here

* It’s important to remember that when someone doesn’t respond, that’s not the end of the world. There are always more people out there, and some of them are better for you than the person who blew you off.

* If it weren’t for all my practice with OKCupid, and all of our failures and partial successes are making us better at those skills. None of it is a loss.

I’m really looking forward to seeing her again,False,self,t5_2rct2,1338913908.0,,,t3_ukdtp

That’s how she described me in her text to her friends on our first date. Through a common interest in Gordon Ramsay, that featured retro video games and artisan craft beers (how much more hipster can you get?). She had warned me multiple times that she wasn’t very attractive, despite her posted pictures saying otherwise. When I left work the afternoon before our date, I got there a little early as I wasn’t familiar with the area, and didn’t want to risk being late. Not soon after I sat down, she walked in apparently with the same agenda. Luckily, I knew it was her right away. Her pictures didn’t do her justice, and I felt a warm smile grow on my face as she sat down next to me. With a bourbon already in hand

After our first drink we meandered around the bar looking for potential games to play

We returned inside for another drink and more conversation. I nearly blew it at this point by asking some uncomfortable questions because I’m stupid and socially awkward. But in my apologetic state she did something I’ll never forget. She grabbed my shirt

“So things aren’t so bad after all...” I thought. I asked her go on a short walk with me to my car, and retrieved the special item.

“My former boss has a wife who over the years has received numerous perks from pharmaceutical companies…cotton ball containers, and so on,” I explained. “When you mentioned you had broken something of yours I was reminded that I had two of these and felt that I could help you out.”

When I created my profile, friendly, easy to talk to, my life is together.  I'm a catch.  I'll get flooded by messages (I'd already heard about how it usually goes for women), I'll choose the best guy out of all of them, and be happily settled down in my next relationship, in no time at all.  Right?

That's not what happened.  Of course not.  You've all been on OKCupid long enough to know just how unrealistic I was being.  But

But what happened was far different.  Yes I got messages, I'd never hear from them again.  

I was really

If the guy moved on and we hadn't gotten physical, pretending like he's interested but just wants to cut and run as soon as they get what they want.""  If the guy was younger than me, I'd blame him for treating me like a cougar and not a real person to take seriously.  Etc etc.  

Mostly, I decided.  It gives everyone this disposable mentality, where dates are so easy to line up that people are easily tossed aside if they don't completely wow you on the first impression.  I decided that attractive guys on OKCupid get too much attention and let it go to their head, why settle for just one girl when you could be sleeping with all of Houston?  I decided that the not-top-5% guys end up bitter and hostile towards women, and the top 5% guys turn into players who don't respect women.  

Because clearly

The truth is a little bit more simple.  I'm not everyone's type.  And I needed to get over myself.  A guy can be a perfectly good, and yet not end up wanting to pursue me.  It doesn't make him a player/misogynist/general asshole, it just means he met me and didn't make the connection he was looking for, for whatever reason.  And the more I was raging out (even inwardly, even unexpressed) against all these guys who weren't falling in love with me, the more of an ass I made of myself.

So I'm trying to fix that now.  I'm trying to go into this with fewer expectations and a little more humility.  I'm trying to not treat guys I meet as representatives of all males on OKCupid.  They don't know what the other guys are doing

I'm trying to realize that nobody owes me anything

This stuff is so obvious that it sounds stupid to say it out loud, bitter sense of entitlement in other people - but it took me this long to figure out I have the same problem, myself.

So for those of you that have been on OkCupid, asking me questions about who I idolized growing up, did I prefer to be a top or bottom, etc.. However, I eventually stumbled across a question that absolutely blew my mind. It's the kind of question that, if asked on a first date, results in a restraining order. The kind of question that makes you do a spit-take and then sip the beverage off the floor like a dog because all the oxygen is racing out of your brain and you get so dehydrated that you're afraid you'll pass out. The question was:

""If you were having the best sex of your life and your partner asked you to squeak like a dolphin

Take a second.

One more.

Ok

There is one positive thing about this: I learned a lot about myself when considering this question. I considered what prerequisites would have to be met for me to... *ehem*... 'squeak like a dolphin.' A lot of folks look back at the time when they discovered their kinks. It's a big moment for a lot of us because of how important our kinks are to us. That was my moment.

And to answer your next question: No, I could think of no bigger boner-killer than the thought of a dolphin creeping into my mind during arousal. But, I'll get back to that a little later.

So anyways...

I finally arrange to meet this dude and we really hit it off. He's just what I like in a guy: short (around 5'5), and a bit on the clumsy side. He's what baseball buffs call a Five Tools guy. So once our date is reaching that peak (and by peak, I mean the part where the clothes come off), I am simultaneously reaching mine.

However, as he's on all fours, ready for me to do my thing, I interject with a question: ""Hey man, what the hell's your last name."" He turned his head back to me with these big, cute puppy-dog eyes.

And at that point

""... Mencia..""

Take a second.

One more.

Ok

I was

I was not

So here I am, I gave into my urges and soldiered on.

Now, I have images fly through my head at almost warp-speed; not one of them can I nail down. That's probably for the best, because they'd probably be trivial things like (""Goddammit, did I leave the coffee pot on?"") or (""What's gonna happen to Jair Jurrjens when the Orioles get tired of his bullshit?"").

However

It was Carlos Mencia. That fat

How repulsed was I by this? I lost my erectile faculties completely and came right then and there. And when I realized that the last image I saw before ejaculating was Carlos Mencia...

I squeaked like a dolphin.

1. Add said user to your favorites. 
2. Assuming you are using your computer (I don't recall seeing this prompt on the mobile app, you do want to inform him/her that you have added them as a favorite.
3. Go to your outbox - you should see an outgoing message to said user informing him/her that you've added them as a favorite. You can then reply to that very message with whatever outstanding flattery/deuchebaggery you originally had in mind.

* **Don't take internet dating too serious.** Dating should be fun, and/or talk about the future. Sure, its nice to give little hints, but don't write your essays like you're trying to impress your boss. This goes for messages too. It is harder to reply to serious messages. Make it easy for the other party to talk by being playful and fun.

* **Pictures are the most important part of any profile.** We're all equally shallow. Look good and have flattering photos.

* **Stop being so damn trusting.** I've gone on multiple first dates with girls that involved me driving 30+ miles away from their home and doing hard drugs in an unknown environment. It was fun and all

* **Don't invest in people until they've given you a reason.** Just because a pretty girl likes the same bands and shows as you doesn't mean she's a perfect match. Same goes after a promising first date

* **Don't hype yourself up about someone.** Same vain as above. I approach every date the same. I'm going to meet someone, but will have also vetted them thoroughly to really know they are.

* **If someone is only interested in a platonic relationship

* **Don't be afraid of failure.** You'll be rejected, it's all part of life and dating. All those people are just missing out on the awesome person you are. Sucks for them, not you.

* **Everyone likes to have sex. Well

* **Get out of your comfort zone.** This is how you grow as a person. I usually wait for the 2nd date to have a more adventurous outing

* **Have fun.** Jesus, listen to their stories, and share their ideas. You'll get more comfortable with interacting with people when you remind yourself, you're there to have fun.

* **Set up your boundaries early.** Not the type to text often? Set that expectation early. The longer things go on for

* **Plan short first dates.** Be guarded and skeptical of strangers you meet on the internet. Seriously. If things go really well

* **Constantly change your profile.** New pictures, and etc. These things keep your profile in the ""relevant"" area and will give you better visibility.

* **Take care of yourself.** Go the gym, happier, and a better all around person.

Ok

So I'm getting a little burnt out with dating and this one just put the cherry on top. I messaged back and forth with this guy a couple of times before he asks me for my number. His profile was pretty glib but he seemed normal enough in his messages so I gave it to him.

We text back and forth for a couple of days. I usually find it pretty annoying when someone is constantly going on about my looks or asking me for pictures. Several times this guy sends me a message asking me for pictures because he ""wants to see my beautiful face"", I do art modeling as a side-job (I don't mention that on my profile) and I have professional photos of both my face and my body from my portfolio on the profile and they're rather good, so I don't know how it could be hard to have any doubts as to my looks. Accompanying these texts are the obligatory ;) ;P ;D ;) A couple of times he even told me he thinks I wouldn't send him more pictures because I was probably fat.

So he asked me if I wanted to grab dinner. I was bored and didn't have any plans that night so I said yes. I didn't go out of my way to babe-out for this guy. I get there and he didn't look like he put in too much of an effort either. So there's a little bit of a wait for the restaurant and he suggests we walk. We walk and talk for a few minutes and he asks me about my job. I tell him what I do for a living (it's a decent job

""I still don't really believe how you can live alone

So I just say

""But still. I mean how do you live in *(my city)* alone?""

I just shrugged. What the hell do you say at that point? ""I SELL DRUGS AND I PROSTITUTE!"" 

We're walking down the street and it occurs to me we were probably out of range for our little beeper thing to work if our table was open. So I suggest we turn back. By a happy coincidence there happens to be a group of guys loitering on the corner

""Because you're too afraid to walk by some teenagers?"" His tone was even more condescending than asking about how I could afford to live alone.

Even then... what the fuck

He then asks me to show him my other tattoos. I said no and he scoffs

... ""No, ""Don't you think it's pretty stupid that she doesn't eat meat."" At this point the waitress looks at me in obvious distress mumbles about how it's really a preference and hurries away.

His phone rings

And he said ""Well maybe it's just your attitude.""

That. Right there. I was done. I put down a $20

*This is the message I sent.*

&gt;Hi there. Mind taking a minute to help me out with something? I'm not having very good luck with people responding to my messages
Thanks so much!
--Mike 

*And these are the responses I got. Most seem to be conventional wisdom around here






&gt;(1) Hey Mike. I usually like when guys mention something on my profile. It shows that they're actually interested in me enough to read my profile. I've also been known to like a challenge. Like when I say something jokingly on my profile and someone brings it up but throws in a joke, and is smart enough to not try to start that debate with something really serious. Good Luck! 

(2)

&gt;Personally I prefer a message with questions in it
I'm immediately turned off by things like ""hey gorgeous u look like someone I could get along with"" there isn't anything to respond to. Although compliments can be flattering if presented properly
What kind of messages do you send? I really couldn't give you a constructive answer without knowing. 

(3)

&gt;No one wants to read a message that sounds like it could be written for anyone. Start off polite but mention something(s) you appreciated or agreed with on her profile. Ask her for details on the things her profile said she likes. Don't just say ""Oh

&gt;Another tip that I had to take myself; Don't put so much emphasis on match percentage. 

(4)

&gt;Hahahaha... OK, but possibly these other high-matching chicks would agree:

&gt;Turn-offs include:

&gt;-""ur cute wanna cuddle?""
-""What part of town do you live in?""
-""You seem like a nice/fun person.""
-copy-pasted messages that were clearly sent to every other girl on the site (i.e. ""You seem like a genuinely fun girl and you're gorgeous as well. I would love the chance to get to know you better."")
-making condescending remarks about things the girl has said she really likes

&gt;Good ways to message someone:

&gt;-Ask about or make a joke about something in the girl's ""About"" section that strikes your interest (though I wouldn't go as far as to reference anything in ""Questions"" tab).

&gt;And... Uh... That's actually all I can think of. What do you normally open with? 

(5)

&gt;Reference something in my profile. Don't tell me I'm beautiful, sexy, whatever. Don't just say ""hi"" or give me your name. Don't ask me out in the first message. Please ask a question. 

(6)

&gt;The thing is, I go read the person's profile. If at that point I like what I'm reading and what I'm seeing, I'll respond. Hell, I dated someone off here for a year and his introductory message was weird as fuck all. 

(7)

&gt;Stuff that shows that you actually read the profile

(8)

&gt;hmmmmm, too, and I'll usually just have a little fun with those (that's just me, though; I'm not sure how other girls would react, with all the creepers on here and whatnot).
Generally
If you haven't already

(9)

&gt;messages that just say ""hey how are you? i like (common interest) too

Aaaaand (10)

&gt;Hello. Normally, and contain proper grammar and spelling. Creativity is a definite plus. I also check their profile for a few things. They must be an atheist, avoid certain profile cliches, and be reasonably attractive. I know that the attractiveness thing is a little shallow, but I'm not expecting like a model or anything. Based on profile I would have messaged you back. Hope that helps. :)
&gt;-*[REDACTED NAME}*

&gt;2 examples of long messages that I replied to:

&gt;Example 1:
&gt;Hi there Julia, even for OkCupid. I was a vegetarian for 4 years. Not for animal rights reasons you see, I just REALLY hate Trees! I'm down with PC gaming, though I haven't actually played the clickfest you call Diablo. I have an alcohol stove made from soda cans. A part of me really wants to spray-paint something, and since I can't draw for shit, stencils sound like the tool for me. I could go on, but why turn this into a pretentious listocracy?

&gt;Since I'm told it's best to ask you a question, he would steal their house pet (you have my word he wouldn’t steal Silver). I would keep a lookout for lost pet signs, and then return the pet to its owner. I'm sure some would give me a pie or maybe even a reward. I bet they would give me around fifty dollars. I would buy drugs with the fifty dollars. Not for me, for him. So he wouldn’t rip my face off. What would you do if you had a pet monkey?

&gt;Example 2:
&gt;Ever try on each other's glasses on a first date? So

&gt;Also, so everyone's name was an oxymoron.

&gt;Stay on OkC. It has plenty of dumbfuck users, in my opinion.

&gt;2 examples of short messages that I replied to:

&gt;Example 1:
What is your favorite Porcupine Tree album or song(s)?
Also

&gt;Example 2:
Haha you're commentary on the dynamics of okc its spot on hilarious
I would love to go on an adventure night with you sometime
