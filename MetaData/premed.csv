OKAY! The ONE rule. I would be so bold as to say these PDFs are ALL of the information that is covered on the MCAT. Fuck $2, Kaplan, Gold Standard, The Berkeley Review, The Princeton Review, Columbia Review, ARCO, maybe these study guides help 10% of you do 5% better on the MCAT, I must say there is one rule: you have to pay it forward. Help out someone younger than you get into medical school. And it can't be something simple; you have to put some effort into it (Like the 100 hours of work i'm giving y'all for free). Maybe give them these PDFs. Yes, the world will be a better place :)

2. The MCAT - a more focused guide on what I found good

http://i.imgur.com/GJ5Mz.png

I want you guys to do just as well, unfortunately.

EDIT: I had the FAQ in a comment

FAQ

* How much did you study?

I started three months before my MCAT. Honestly, and I skipped quite a few days. The second month, I studied as much as I could, but it was April, and finals were approaching. I tried to squeeze in at least three hours a day. When finals ended in late April, I had about two and a half weeks before my MCAT where I studied nearly all day. At least ten hours a day. But guys, don't try to be so methodical about this. Study until you get the topic. Time won't do anything. Just study until you really get it. You know that topic you don't get so well? It'll be on the MCAT. I would bet my left nut on it.

* What is your major?

Math. The last time I took orgo/physics/chem/bio was nearly two years ago

* How did you study?

I did not take a course. I did have the kaplan review books from a friend who took the course, I would choose TPR. And most importantly: I took a ton of practice tests.

For the first month and 3 weeks, those will come with practice. It's much more important to have that analytical mind. Those really specific random details account for maybe 5% of the bio section. Most of it is how well can you analyze the passage. So please, practice as many practice MCATs as you can. I took two TPRs, two kaplans, and five AAMCs.
When I got a question wrong

* What did you think of the practice tests?

I hate the TPR tests. They're hard, but like stupidly tricky. Shit that they wouldn't do on the real mcat. They try to emphasize memorization and not analysis. The verbal is tailored to their strategies so you think they're working, and honestly they're a bit contradictory. My TPR practice test scores were 31, 33. TPR will generally give you lower scores than you will actually get.
Kaplan has good problems in that amazon book where they give you two tests. The questions are good
I liked AAMC ones, I didn't feel like it was necessarily harder. Like, they weren't really tricky, there was just more info. I'm not sure about my average.

* Any general tips?

* Physics - Guys, all you NEED is X, V, and A. You can find anything else with these three equations. I don't want you to think ""Oh in this situation I'd use...."" That's a bad mentality; you will run out of brainspace.

* Gen Chem - Not my strongest subject

I found the PS section on the real MCAT was a bit harder than my practices

* Verbal - The only tip I have is hold your pace, I was blown away by this verbal score. I found the VR section on the real MCAT was much more straightforward, but with longer passages. My score came out higher.

* Bio - My BS was lower, know molecular genetics really well. The real bio sections had two passages adapted from papers, which made them a lot more dense. This caused me to freak out a little bit. DOn't let this happen to you. I found the bio was harder on the real thing, but not because of obscure facts. The analysis was the hard part. My bio score came out lower.

* Orgo - Ahh my favorite! Guys, learn how mechanisms WORK. Why does that base extract the alpha hydrogen on an enol to form an enolate? It's not important that it does, it's important WHY it does. My MCAT didn't have a lot of orgo on it, it kind of pissed me off. There was some biochem, but that's not really orgo :/

* A general tip -- A math major tries to memorize as little as possible and derive everything from as little as possible. This is the best advice I can give you

* OH and if anyone cares: Writing - This is not a humanities essay. Do not try to be eloquent. Be clear, consistent. This is about how well can you formulate an argument and stay consistent with it. Do not contradict yourself in any circumstance. Use real-world examples, and include a supporting example in the first paragraph. If you find an opportunity to split one paragraph up into two, take it. It will help your essay stand out. Take five minutes before you even start writing to formulate your rule. They will tell you a situation. You will think ""This is true in this, this, and this case, but the line is drawn here, very consistent with that. Then look at your essay
Do not freak out. Don't spiral. THis is a hard test and it's meant to be hard. Hell, and to be unsure on a lot of them. It's a thinking test. No question is meant for you to be like ""Oh, I remember reading that, I'll just regurgitate it.""


* Finally, and to compensate, I drank a cup (read: a cup, not a shot) of espresso. I was so wired when I got there, I literally could not stop shaking. It wore off when I got to bio, and I was really sleepy. The entire rest of the day, I was sleepy, overdosed on caffeine. I was nauseous, re-read your questions.) But maybe cut a few breaks short. I say this because it's really annoying to do your verbal when everyone else is typing away

I can clarify on any things also

Edit: I wanted to add one more comment. I was expressing concern about how I might not do well in medical school because I dislike memorization so much to a physician I shadowed. He told me this and it really stuck with me.

""Yes there's memorization. But what you memorize is a road map. After you've got the road map memorized, but if they can't use it to figure out how to get from point A to point B, they'll fail as doctors.""

I don't know why

My MCAT advice:

This test is your enemy. This is the stupid bureaucratic hurdle that
says nothing about you
nothing but ends up meaning everything. You should be furious at this
test
to destroy this test
does not faze you. Be angry
Funnel it.

DO NOT let the first bunch of AAMC tests fool you
different from the actual test as they are chopped from pre-CBT tests.
Tests 8, however, very similar to the actual test. DO
take these seriously
score would range from a 26 to a 36

Don't let it freak you out too much. If you do worse than you expect
regroup. Call your best friends. Complain about the MCAT for 3
minutes
and reminisce about how the old days were great but the future will be even greater for 45 minutes. Go for a drive, and on the same day, get back to the MCAT, and work twice as hard as you did the last time.

The things that make me tired or frustrated arent necessarily simply
related to the misery of the given situation as much as the constancy
or inescapablity of it. Change things up
once in a while. Between MCAT sections
this is very important. Go look at the horizon if its nice outside
listen to the rain
on something simple or dark and constant. On the real test
be able to think that you're starting a whole new test every time a
break comes up
exam. Imagine you're in a different environment, ""This test is keeping me from the people I love, the things I care to do, the places I want to be"". Think, ""Soon it'll be over, and
all of this will come back"". Or better
simply be back to normal. Things will be better
being equal
will be your reward for success. Every little bit helps.

Chronology/Practical Matters:

Study Materials: TPR books and online tests
books

I started actually studying in November
My big thing was using flashcards
Examkrackers books (which I highly recommend) on flashcards instead of notebooks. Its more portable, just be patient with yourself. In the end I had too many to count, which means they were no longer portable or quick to get through, but still they are useful.

Come December I memorized pretty much all of the bold/underlined bits of the examkrackers bio, so I had to use alot of mnemonics to get through it all. Make mnemonics that are memorable to you specifically, use nasty words, sexual allusions, hell anything you can muster to make sure you never forget 'em. Examkrackers is still too much information to know all of it, so understand general concepts, the way it may appear on the test, since alot of the MCAT involves juggling the equations around to fit whatever the passage requires.

I think Bio is essentially a glorified Verbal section. If you read
thoroughly enough
enough
aiming for 85% correct to get a great score. Thus
actually helped by discrete prior information! HOWEVER
the test much faster if you are well versed in bio/ochem. Memorize all
of the underlined and orange parts of the examkrackers Bio and Ochem books

The writing section is totally stupid. It is designed to make you
tired before the Bio section. If you place importance on it
be important, if you can write like a logical English speaking
human being
all.

January
TPR or non-AAMC tests to gauge what you're weak at
they're ridiculously hard. I hear the Kaplan tests are easier
watch out
you know the relevant material
impossible
in anything but a cursory manner. Trust yourself. Keep a total of the
stupid/avoidable errors you are making per test. Practice more and
watch this number decline. The key is not to know everything there is
to know
zero. This is very possible. Remember: 85% correct!

By Mid-Jan
relax. I figured, and
confident. I'm the most relaxed
surrounded by my friends or family
should have spent with them anyway catching up. Thank them

Listen to some John Mayer,
whatever makes you feel good. I went into the test caring enough to
concentrate
performance
suggest finding your own way of keeping yourself in this thinly
defined state. The MCAT is meaningless in the way it defines you
nearly arbitrary in its attempts to do so. Things that matter should
never be meaningless
does not matter as much as they tell you it does. This is what makes
it conquerable.

Let's talk for just a quick minute about what [most] med schools use GPA for.  Your GPA and MCAT are used as a first pass to see which applications get a closer look.  I can't tell you if schools have hard cut-offs (above a certain GPA and above a certain MCAT) or if they use a sliding scale (with a particular GPA, then the rest of your application gets scrutinized more closely.  At most places, I would imagine that a 3.5 GPA gets you that closer look.  I can't tell you that this is what every med school does, but I do know that there are several that do, and it makes sense.

If you want to go to medical school

I applied straight out of undergrad with, got wait-listed at 3 places.  Didn't get in.  I could have given up, but I still wanted to be an MD.  So I worked for a year, shored up the application, applied again.  Got 2 interviews, got 2 acceptances (long story as to why I got fewer interviews with a stronger application, but it had to do with AMCAS screwing me over).  In less than two weeks, I'll start my residency in emergency medicine.  If you want it,self,

So I got the email today that I was accepted to a US medical school off of the wait-list! Here's my application info

* MCAT: 30P (Taken in August)
* Application Submission Date: Mid September
* Apps ""complete"" at all schools: Mid November (Really late
* 17 applications, Unranked). Denied, Deferred (still hoping!), WL to Accepted.
* LORs: 5, Geology, Biochemistry professors, and one from my PI. I really made the effort to get to know my professors, and spent a lot of time in office hours and asking questions after class. Half my interviewers mentioned that my letters were exceptional, and that they really made me stand out. So letters do matter, get good ones!
* GPA: First school: 3.89
* Second School (higher ranked than first school was): Was a 3.3 at time of submission
* **I had a C+ in physics and a B- in vector calculus. I also had 3 Ws freshman year.**

EDITING for more info!
 
ECs: 

* I spent every friday for a year shadowing in the same endocrinology clinic for 3 hours or so

* Volunteer hours are a little trickier to calculate, I just did what I was passionate about (I did these things before I even decided to become pre-med). It averaged about 4 hrs/week since 2010 for the free tutoring (taking into account the weeks where it was much much more, and the weeks where it was almost nothing), and 2 hours a week for the classroom work. I specified in the descriptions that it wasn't 2 hrs/week every week, but rather when I was on break or had a day off or two. I also spent two summers volunteering in a lab at Caltech, but I put that as research experience.

* My other meaningful activities were art (freelance work as well), and my main personal statement about the experiences shadowing that led me to want to pursue a certain specialty.

I’ve been where most of you have been.  I’ve had friends that have been in the same situations. The one lesson that I’ve learned from all of this is the following:

KNOW WHEN TO ASK FOR HELP; DON’T BE AFRAID TO ASK FOR HELP

Now we do a great job of that here with people asking for help and people providing wonderful answers. 

BUT

Nothing replaces the resources available to every single one of you at your schools. Your counseling departments. These are trained individuals that are there to help you. They have seen all of this and can help you get through your troubles. They can provide a sympathetic ear

PLEASE go to these individuals and talk to them if you are having troubles or feeling stressed. 

I’m sure that I am not the only person here who has lost friends for many reasons some personal, be a sympathetic ear. Make sure your friends know that you are there to support them and that they can come to you with anything. 

Use the resources available to you

I’ve been meaning for a while to post this but I haven’t been able to figure out how to say it. This is about as eloquently as I can put it.

The link I provided provides a how to. Basically I convert my typed notes, muscle contraction, etc., or even physics concepts on projectile motion, magnetism etc. into an MP3 track on iTunes. sometimes its even useful to just look up a concept on wikipedia and then drag bits and pieces into a pdf to convert and listen to later. 

 I'm a bit of an auditory learner and I have ~1 hour commute to work. It's like listening to a personally tailored lecture on weakness areas that you may chose to brush up on. Even if you don't commute its sometimes  useful to listen while working out, any number of mindless activities.

1355608262.0,14wtzw,Part 5: The Interview,ThePremedGuide,61,11,23,"I am starting with part 5 because a few people PMed me asking for tips for their upcoming interviews

So you’ve been invited to the interview, (2) are truly dedicated to lifelong service as a physician, and (3) can relate and interact with people. If you can convince them of these three things, I believe that you should receive an acceptance.

**Attire**

Admittedly, but for those of you who struggle with understanding of what “business formal” entails, it’s quite simple. 
	
Buy a suit if you do not own one. I understand this can be expensive but I’m not advocating going to Barney’s and spending a small fortune. A suit will come in handy for more than just this interview. 

No suits are to be worn straight off the hanger, and the “arm holes.” These are tough to tailor and should be well fitting. The pants can be brought up and slimmer. Neutral, darker tones are the best IMHO: black, charcoal, dark grey, or dark brown (although not my favorite suit color). Tie a good knot, I like the “Pratt Knot” personally, but take care of yourself.

Check out /r/malefashionadvice. Just look through some of the pictures and guides. They really have an amazing knowledge of fashion and you can get some great ideas from there. But a few last minute tips:

* Your tie should touch your belt. I put the tip of my tie to rest somewhere near the top of my belt.
* Never button the bottom button on a suit jacket.
* If you’re having trouble with the awkward “tie is not snug in the collar” problem
* Match your belt leather with your shoe leather

More tips couresty of /u/johnnyscans 

* Fit in the shoulders is hands down the most important part of a suit jacket. Sleeve length can be changed quite easily. The jacket can be taken in and shortened. Nothing can be done to change the way a jacket flows off the shoulders. To test if a jacket fits in the shoulders put it on and lean your shoulder into a wall. You (not the pad) should make contact first.
* Charcoal suit = black shoes. Blue suit = brown shoes. While the opposites work
*Get your shirts tailored. Taking in a shirt is child's play for a tailor. You may very well end up out of your jacket (be it when eating or something else) and you want to make sure it doesn't look like you're wearing your big brother's shirt.
* Shine your shoes. Patients are going to judge you based on your appearance. You better believe your interviewers are going to do the same damn thing.
* Get some Crest White Strips and take care of any bad breath issues.


*FOR WOMEN*: Courtesy of /u/beediie 

Female med student here

* The interview is business professional - suits (like [these](http://i.imgur.com/FRoFz.jpg) ) are definitely the most appropriate choice. Note that there is a difference between this and business casual
* Either a skirt or pants are fine, make sure to test this).
* Definitely wear a blazer
* Heels or flats are appropriate
* Choose good quality clothes - I personally like LOFT, and Gap. And I usually stick to very basic items so I can wear them interchangeably. At the time, it can be frustrating to spend money on these clothes, but if you are accepted, you WILL wear them often. If you make the investment now, you won't have to later. Plus, you'll look great :)

**Preparatory reading** 

Disregard everything you believe about this because it is no longer optional, what I would change about it, or what I loved about it. It will affect your life as a doctor, and is quite possibly the biggest thing that will happen to healthcare in our generation. [This] (http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/vb8vs/eli5_what_exactly_is_obamacare_and_what_did_it/c530lfx)  is what I read and it was more than enough to answer any questions, form an opinion, and get a decent grasp on how it will affect physicians (look in the comments, /u/a_real_md has an awesome writeup on this). Anecdotally, and what book I was reading at the moment (Game of Thrones for you fans out there)

**Understand your own application** 

Take a step back and look at your application. Where are you weak? Where are you strong? What is missing? What is something unique? Questions will come up about these things. In my case, or your favorite work of art, or your favorite artist.

You should be able to speak about everything on your application for 10-15 minutes. If you cannot

**Schedule** 

This is an opinion section. I would always arrive in the city two days before my interview. I wanted to explore the city, but love the surroundings.


**Interview**

Arrive early. I typically arrived ~20 minutes before they told me to. To be early is to be on time, and lunch (the latter two are typically accompanied by a M1 or M2 student).  A friend of mine gave me some great advice before my first interview: “Treat everyone as if they are a spy. You never know who is going to have a word on your application.” This isn’t to make you paranoid, but just to keep you humble and understand that the receptionist who leads you to the room or that M2 walking you around the campus is actually performing a covert interview.

Most of the time you’ll arrive and there will be other interviewees there mingling about. These people are not your enemies they are possibly your future classmates and friends. Talk, be the recipient of friendly banter or just listen in.

**Posturing** 

Stand up straight. Don’t roll your shoulders or slouch. You don’t need to be beaming the whole time, or stress (which is understandable) but this is a time to be joyous! When gesturing, keep your hands in (what my father calls) the box: within the frame of your body, below the shoulders but above your belt. Look people in the eye and nod in both understanding and agreement.
	

**Don’t put yourself in the hole**

 Realize you’re speaking to a well-educated person who owns their own opinions. They can critique your arguments well, and I was asked about these things.  Have it figured out yourself.

No “likes”, “Hmm, that's an interesting question…” Don’t ramble: be concise. The biggest thing here is answer the question.  Part of my job now requires me to interview people, and incredibly often I will ask a question and the interviewee will not answer it or dance around it. This comes off terribly.  If you don’t understand, tell them that. Say, “I’m sorry I don’t really understand the question, can you say it again or slightly different?” This is much more acceptable than just spewing information that is completely off-topic.

**Confidence** 

I’m going to be honest here. You, and it smells like the shit. But, you are still not a medical student, you are not a physician, you will not cure cancer. Be humbly confident. Be the David that knew he could slay Goliath with a few fuckin stones but don’t walk out and bash your shield. Be Brad Pitt as Achilles at the Battle of Thessaly in Troy, you’re deadly but you don’t make a show of walking out into the battleground. Be Maximus Decimus Meridius, commander of Armies of the North

**Post Interview**

This is probably the most personal-preference part of this post. A lot of people swear by “Thank You’s” and LOIs. I, I am a firm believe in necessary update letters. A lot of schools tell you what they want or don’t want in post-interview correspondence, so abide by those. If the school doesn’t have guidelines, if you get an award, a presentation, a publication (definitely this), or anything else that you think will turn the tide for your application, things will happen and they want to be made aware of things that might be game-changing. This also goes both ways. I have a friend charged with a DUI who was required to inform all of his schools last cycle. His offer was rescinded at one school. 

Well that’s it. I don’t have much more to say and I would greatly appreciate anyone’s input or thoughts on both my writing style and the content. Also, please PM this account and let me know. Also, I deleted my old account that I used to inquire about interest because of anonymity.

1336575009.0,ter1k,Helpful tips for applying to medical school,Sentriculus,51,4,20,"I wanted to compile a concise list of things I learned during the application cycle last year.  If the advice seems obvious to you

* Keep in mind that you must pay for both primary and secondary applications.  Primary apps on AMCAS will be $160 for the first school and $30 for every school after that.  If a school wishes you to send a secondary app, they sent me a rejection within 24-hours (it was just to get my money).

* Request letters of recommendation early in the process.  You do not need to get those letters from your undergraduate schools pre-medicine committee as long as you have 3 or more individual letters from faculty or supervisors who could represent your value to the admissions committee.  Keep bugging your rec-letter writers every few weeks as they tend to put it off.  Be sure to send thank you cards and/or treats when they have done their job as you might need their help next year too.

* If you are writing a long description for the extracurricular activities, write and save all of it in a word document first.  This will keep your thoughts safe in case the computer freezes, you need those answers for other secondary apps, or you are not good at grammar.

* When typing out all of your grades

* Minor speeding violations are not misdemeanors

* You cannot edit the Letter of Recommendation writers once you have input that information.  Be sure you have received a confirmation from your selected rec-letter writer that they **will** do it before you put her/his name down.  Otherwise

* Interviewers sometimes won't read your primary application until they have you seated in front of them.  Try to write descriptions of extracurricular activities clearly so that they could skim it on the fly as they interview you.

* Once you receive secondary apps, and submit them with app fee **as soon as possible**.  This will determine how soon in the application process you get an interview.

* Practice for the interview with a medical student.  Make sure they will be someone who is brutally honest with you.  Consult many resources and practice question lists to have a mental bank of what you wish to say when the time comes.

Good luck to all the 2012-2013 applicants of both MD and DO!

[Whites](http://i44.tinypic.com/2ytptlj.jpg)

[African-American](http://i40.tinypic.com/ayud6o.jpg)

In this day and age for one person to have an advantage this large over another person based ONLY on the color of their skin is an absolute travesty. I go to a university in a metro area with a racially diverse set of students, with the same teachers and same opportunities, will be able to make B's and C's when I make A's and will still have a better chance of medical school acceptance than me just because they are not white. 


Lets look at the graphs I referenced. They show that an African-American student with a 3.50 gpa and a 25 MCAT score


An African-American student with a 3.69 gpa and a **22 on the MCAT** still gets an acceptance to medical school **over 50% of the time!** I honestly do not think someone who scores a 22 on the MCAT is qualified to go to medical school AT ALL *no matter what race they are


This makes me angry for more reasons other than it just being downright racial discrimination.

1. It is taking spots at medical schools away from students who are more deserving and who have worked harder.

2. It is devaluing and misrepresenting the MD degree for everyone else.

3. It further promotes racism by causing whites and Asians to automatically assume that a black student didnt have to meet the same requirements for medical school acceptance as they did. This further promotes feelings of discontent toward the minorities and discredits those black students who actually did earn their medical school acceptance.

I am white and come from a middle class family with no ties to medicine

Sorry for the long rant but I just had to let my feelings be known on this issue. Of all the professions in the world, why accept under-qualified applicants based on race then?

2) The process is a crapshoot, program, atmosphere, or otherwise. Don't be intimidated by high stats. Good LOR's and a great personal statement can compensate for squiffy numbers. I got interviews at schools for which I was well below their 10th percentile for MCAT, and didn't get offered interviews at some schools I was quite qualified for. It's really a crapshoot. 

3) If your numbers are fantastic, and won't attend if they do accept you. I know of many people who attended top-tier schools, and were often rejected from lower tier ones without interview.

EDIT: Some good points brought up below:

4) Fantastic stats don't guarantee anything. I once spoke with a top 10 AdCom, but if they know their class is full of pretentious gunners, they may not accept you because they don't think you'll fit in with the rest of the class, regardless of everybody's stats. 

The same AdCom who mentioned the advice above also admitted that if he's having a bad day, there might not be anything wrong with you or your application, you may have just had a shitty luck of the draw. However, it is important to be truly introspective when you evaluate your rejections before your second application. If you got rejected because your lack of social skills during the interview, practice! If you got rejected because you're actually a jerk, try to fix that before you try again. It's not always just about improving your shadowing hours and MCAT scores, sometimes you have to improve your own character before you can be a successful doctor.

Since the MCAT is soon approaching for a lot of us

**Verbal**

1. Verbal is all about the author. After reading a passage

2. One thing that helped me a lot was to not go into each passage blind (meaning not knowing what the passage is about). First

3. This one really helped me out but it might not be for you. I am a really fast reader but I oftentimes dont understand things I just read. What I did to combat this is highlight (underline if you are not using a computer/AAMC practice test) the main word/phrase of each sentence of the passage. The main word isn't just what the sentence is about

4. Some questions you will figure out right away. Other ones are harder. If you find yourself stuck on a question, look at II). If this is right or wrong, you can cross out the other answers accordingly.

They are NOT directed towards any one person b/c I didn't include something that I only saw once)

Slight problems I'm seeing:


1. ""I saw Elizabeth Walters in Chicago Hospital on April 15th"" HIPAA! HIPAA! HIPAA!!!! You cannot use names and you cannot use any identifying information. Even if you change the name, did the doctor you shadowed give you permission to use her name?

2. ""After studying and volunteering

3. Pretty narratives. It's hard to avoid this

4. ""I've wanted to be a doctor ever since I emerged from my mother's vagina."" Ok, who doesn't love the threat of a lawsuit after 72 hours of sleepless nights! I'm not questioning people's lifelong desires but you need to show that you know that being a doctor is more than being that sexy guy/gal on TV in a bitchin' white coat.

5. ""I want to be a doctor because I want to help people."" Augh! Then why don't you volunteer to babysit for a single mother while she finishes her bachelor degree? This is actually not something I've seen but Flagellaa's post made me think about it. A lot of people have been really good about explaining why they want to be a doctor

If I read your PS, please message me. Also, if you haven't sent me your essay, yes you can send it and I'd be happy to read it.  I had a lot of help with my application so this is my way of paying it forward. I also think this sort of thing builds a nice sense of community.

You really have the opportunity to see what a day in the hospital of a surgery resident is like. You have the chance to stay on call in the hospital, you get to hear what its REALLY like.

During the days

Most importantly
So

1 - You get to see how the ED really functions. How triaging works and the many different techs

After the patient is stabilized (and if they aren't immediately you get to see true trauma surgery

2 - You get to observe the vast amount of diagnostic tools used for patients, ultrasound, and if you're lucky a MRI.

After the scan is taken

3 - You get to see how radiology functions. You have the chance

Then depending on what radiology says

4 - The sheer amount of consults for trauma is really the best part. Patients often undergo orthopaedic surgery, neurosurgery, plastic surgery and even pharmacy. You are in an amazing position to really see every branch of medicine.

Before or after consulted surgeries

5 - You get to witness what true critical care is concerned with. In addition

6 - You can learn about rounding with physicians, and how incredibly knowledgeable attending physicians truly are.

7 - During the days where you're not following a physician with trauma and ICU duty

If you really show up with genuine interest you can get some amazing letters of recommendation

Plus


There you have my $0.02. I hope someone takes my advice and has the same amazing experience I had with trauma. I received two letters from different trauma surgeons and my interviewer made it a point to tell me they were incredible letters. You really can shine in that type of situation where there is so much to learn. Also, observe surgeries with others, and sit  in the ICU with even more. They do talk to each other.

Oh, they made it a point to know my name, involve me with everything, and help your overall understanding.

Good luck!

Edit: So of you have asked how you can get into it. Sorry to not consider the question beforehand. I'll paste my reply.

You can start by emailing the physicians asking for their time. However, rarely replied.

What I did, so they need to be let known first. Afterwards, just show up to the unit with open ears and open eyes.

If this doesn't work the first time, and you may need to, they will see how serious you are about it and will in turn want to help you.

To elaborate on that, so I figured out where to go.

1344004076.0,xmck9,What I learned from /r/premed in 6 months,,39,6,27,"Make sure you know what 4 year university you would like to go to. Many states have programs in order for people who graduate from community colleges in state with their AS (Associate of Science) to easily transfer in to a university in that state. If you plan to get two years under your belt then transfer to a 4 year

If you are top of your class and have a really great work ethic, and leadership roles in student organizations) then you are really not going to have a problem with that debt. You're going to be scooped up by somebody; it's the 'average' student that really gets the shaft in these economic times.

Things students told that are not true and are **not** an edge: Clubs


Things that can make a difference and give you an edge: 

**University Science courses** (CC even with A's does not give advantage and some schools unofficially will not accept students with all CC science premed) (the Ivy League school factor only if your GPA is above average for applying) 


**Volunteering/Shadowing** (I do not believe that you can be accepted without doing this) I'd suggest getting some volunteer experience. Volunteerism, it's more important to be consistent than the actual time spent. You'll want to say you volunteered for an entire year somewhere, even if it's just two or three hours a week, rather than spending whole days for only a few weeks. The important thing is to cover all sorts of different areas of healthcare to demonstrate that you had experienced as much of the field as possible. Whatever you can get inside a hospital or office to observe and interact with doctors which would be beneficial and probably would be the best course of action. Some shadowing of all types of medical professionals will help. You need clinical volunteering, you need leadership roles. Social anxiety is not an excuse in the eyes of admissions committees so you best be sure you can handle the stress. Start this as early as possible in your undergrad since, during your last year, you will have less free time. 


**High GPA and High MCAT preferably** You need to do the MCAT which (for normal people) requires 2-3 months of studying and a financial and time investment in MCAT books. You also need to score over 30, or, if you are taking a gap year, summer after junior year works as well. Start getting your application ready. One of the biggest mistakes you can make is submit a subpar application early vs. a well polished one later. Take the time the time to let your PS develop and evolve into something that will stand out among the 10,000+ applications that a school will receive. Strong writing takes time and shouldn't be rushed - the benefit of turning it in early is quite marginal.

**Research/Lab experience** - volunteer in one of your university's labs.

**Letter of Recommendations**: Build relationships with your professors. Read their research, chat them up. Then if you don't have legitimate reasons to see them during office hours, study harder until you get to some level at which you need them to explain things. 

Things you should know: Any major is fine. No time frame, take it when ready. Any University is fine (Not CC or plain College but Uni)

To try to map out how to accomplish such a task

* Premed prerequisites
* Graduation requirements
* Extracurriculars (research
* MCAT studying and test-taking
* Letters of recommendation
* Application compiling

Regardless of what you major in, but they do need to be from academics or professionals who know you well. The best recommendation comes from a professor with whom you have worked closely for more than just a summer. Your work with the professor has to be consistent and of high quality in whichever field you are working.

1329000184.0,pla1t,A Few Observations and Notes on Premed Culture. A Discussion on the Direction of this Subreddit.,insanemo,33,5,7,"For those of you that don't know

When I started the blog I had one simple mission/goal to change the premed culture. I no longer wanted the word premed to be synonymous with gunners and to be part of a group of students that is almost [universally reviled](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2008/04/top-5-reasons-t/). I wanted to form friendships and foster a culture of caring and helpfulness not one of stepping over people to get to the top at any cost. 

I know I'm not the most active commentator on this subreddit; but rest assured I read everything and chime in on occasion. I've begun to notice people being discouraging and down right disrespectful to others. That's not how I want to see my fellow students behaving and definitely future physicians behaving.

Because of this I'm instituting a few simple rules and a very simple system to enforce these rules.

1. **Rule #1:** Don't be an asshole. If you need to ask if your post makes you come off as an asshole simply don't post it. There is a strict 3 strikes policy on this. No exceptions.

2. **Rule #2:** Follow rule #1.

3. **Rule #3:** If you don't know the answer to the question or are unsure of your answer you must preface it with that fact. We don't need people handing out bad advice. Source your responses. I will warn people about this; but hopefully this will not become a major issue.

4. **Rule #4:** Try to contribute to the discussion and keep this place civil. 



I'm really hoping I won't have to enforce these very much because most of you know this to be common sense. But I will not hesitate to enforce these rules. Lets all work together to make the premed community a great and welcoming place to be. There are other places you can go on the internet if you wish to be ridiculed

**tl;dr:**Don't be an asshole and we won't have any problems. Kapeesh.

Your application *can be* verified [without your MCAT scores](https://www.aamc.org/students/applying/amcas/faqs/171618/can_i_submit_my_amcas_application_without_my_mcat_scores.html). Same for LORs btw. What happens from there is

* Some schools

* Some schools will wait for your app to be verified before sending secondary apps.

* Some schools (not many) will wait for your primary to be verified and complete

* Some

Your MCAT scores are sent to every school to which you applied the minute you receive them. So if you submit your app in June

Finally, contact the schools and tell them so they can note that the update has been made or can be expected. Delays can and do happen because things like this get lost in the kerfuffle. ",,False,self,t5_2rlp9,False,,

I completely wrote off med school as an undergrad and took a ton of pre-med/math/upper-level science classes just because I like science and wanted to learn as much as possible -- plus, they'd care more about me and my interests than my GPA. Which was a 3.2. Could be worse, I thought.

During senior year I had sort of late-college crisis and realized I hated research. I knew I had to enter the ""real world"" soon and thought about what sort of job I could get doing science that wasn't research. I thought

It was about then I did my first and most basic research into medical school. I found out my GPA was abysmally low. I didn't research much further because part of me knew I would just be told to forget about it. Instead I studied for the MCAT. If I did poorly on it, maybe I still had a chance.


I got a 34Q. I had studied hard and I was proud. I moved back home and decided to formulate a plan to build a successful applicant profile. I became a little bit addicted to calculating and recalculating my AMCAS and AACOMAS stats/lurking on SDN trying to figure out whether it was worth it to even try. I got my EMT-B license, in which (with a lot of effort) I'm earning a solid A. This is key, because my science GPA is 2.9-3.0 (depending on the spreadsheet version I use) and cGPA is 3.1 (will be 3.2 after this semester). I know. It's bad.

My EMT class was when I first got excited about emergency medicine. I knew every chapter front and back, triage algorithms -- stuff like that. I've never been so enthusiastic about anything before, so I thought hell, maybe this medicine thing is the right choice after all.


I started my first class of grade-repair last semester at UIC, Best Case Ever, Annals of Emergency Medicine -- plus more online resources than you'd believe that give access to lectures and talks aimed at ER physicians. I love my job, and I'm good at it. The doctor makes the important decisions, but I'm the one who has to explain to the terrified woman on BiPAP why we have to put defibrillator pads on her chest just for the transport to the ICU, and I'm the one who looks the elderly patients in the eye and gets to treat them like a human being deserving of respect even after I change their shit-filled diaper. Yea it sounds gross but it's rewarding, and I feel like I'm doing some good in these people's lives.

Anyway, calculating GPAs and Lizzy scores and reading AACOMAS/AMCAS applicant materials, stuff like that. Lately I had been getting confident -- I've gotten my recommenders chosen, my essay is awesome, and I have a plan. I know it might not happen this year, but I was optimistic.


Then today in the break room one of the ER docs was (unusual for them to be there at all) was hanging out talking to one of the nurses. They were talking about med schools and I said something about how impossible it seems to get into the top ones for even the most perfect-sounding applicants. He was saying yeah, mine's only a 3.1 and he threw his arms back and said 'Forget about it.' Didn't even let me finish the sentence. He's a pretty blunt guy and he couldn't have possibly known how deep that cut hearing it from one of the people I spend all day watching, knowing they're living my dream -- but it felt like getting kicked in the stomach. I said 'well, I'm applying anyway, I'll have a 4.0 post-bacc and my MCAT was really good...' and he interrupted 'no, no, GPA is all. the other stuff matters but no one gets in with that GPA.' what probably hurt the most was that he was right.


Anyway,000 a semester for one class, and I'm paying out of pocket. I'm stuck living with my parents, so I don't have to pay rent or for food, but my life is devoted to this goal pretty much. I realized I could be wasting a huge amount of time and effort. I know SMP's exist but I don't have the money for full tuition (without working)  and was hoping I'd get just barely competitive enough with a few retakes/semester and awesome ECs/essay/LORs. Was that a pipe dream? Am I just wasting my time, my money, my social life


Before today I was thinking it was possible. Now I'm wondering if I made a huge mistake. I'd be really grateful for any perspective from an outsider. Sorry that was so long but I had a lot to get out.

[Here](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/6122001/Blog/Pre-Med%20GPA%20and%20MCAT%20score%20Calculations.xlsx) is the Excel Spreadsheet I made to evaluate my scores. 

[Here](https://www.aamc.org/download/161700/data/table21.pdf) is the source I use for obtaining information regarding a state's MCAT or GPA averages. For an individual medical school

It is a very simple analysis, to the schools mean/average and see the effects on the other. For instance if I had a 35 MCAT score and a 3.0 GPA and were applying to a school with a average MCAT of 30 and GPA of 3.5, then we could see how much my surplus MCAT could influence my lower GPA.

For the previous example we would first find the difference between my raw MCAT score and the schools mean score. Then we take that difference and divide by 45(the maximum possible amount possible to score on the MCAT). Taking that value we multiply it by 4(the maximum possible GPA that any student could hope for) and add it to my 3.0 GPA. If my modified GPA exceeds or meets the mean for the school

1355009405.0,14ir1o,IAMA M1 who by the end of my sophomore year had a 3.4 GPA and barely any ECs. Got into top choice. AMA.,icelittle,37,9,43,"Hey all
So I was wondering if I could help anyone out with the whole pre-med thing. I didn't have any help from counselors/advisors/whatever throughout the process

I am someone who did not really know I wanted to do medicine until my 2nd year. During my second year, and I had no professors to get letters of rec from as I wasn't into the whole kissing ass thing.

So how did I manage going to one of my top choices for med school? I credit a lot to good fortune, and began working in two separate research labs (one bench and one more clinical). I moved on from AMSA to organizations that I actually liked. I took a month out lectures to be in the hospital all day (while catching up on class at night). And instead of just trying to impress professors, I formed real relationships with people who would eventually write me letters of recommendation without kissing ass. But probably most importantly, I started studying for the MCAT VERY early. I'm not a good test-taker, at all, so I literally studied the MCAT for a year, 6 months just a bit a day, and 3 months basically just dedicated to the MCAT. I rocked it with a 37 (which really isn't that great for someone who studied for a year).

By the time I was applying, a 37 MCAT, awesome letters of rec, decent clinical experience, plenty of research, and real specific passions for what drove me, things that I could talk to my interviewers about in a real way.

So yeah, you can do it. Just put in the effort and, once interviews roll around, don't be a complete tool. I may be slow with answering questions and whanot, but at least through December, I would be happy to keep in contact with whoever to offer advice.",,self,,

On one hand: 
I've had many people tell me that it's better to go to a state school and get a high GPA to go to medical school. In middle school (I'm in college now), told me to go to a state school and get close to a 4.0 and I'll be set. This seems to be the overwhelming majority opinion when I talk to the average layman. 

On the other hand:
I've had a few people tell me that it makes a big difference. An interviewer for the school I'm at (who was a physician) was on the admissions committee for a medical school for about 10 years before she decided to take a governmet job and she said that certain schools (including the one I was interviewing for) essential got a +0.5 gpa boost when applying. Another student at my school who will be at Vandy med this fall told me that school name made a big impact during interviews and that GPA from this school was weighted significantly because it was known as an exceptionally tough school.

I have been noticing the community growing faster and faster, if you had any other ideas, etc. We could get the conversation going and the mod can decide what he/she wants to do with it.

1) Flairs. I know there are some actual medical school students, and it could say something like M1, M2, or R1, Attending, Fellow, whatever your standing might be.

2) ""What are my chances"" thread. I know a lot of people want to get second opinions on their own stats, once this ""what are my chances"" thread accumulates enough posts/data, one can simply go to the thread and look for a similar stat and get a general sense of what their chances might be. I know the odds are different for every applicant, but since paranoid pre-meds (like myself) like looking stats up and trying to calm themselves down, I think this might be a good idea.

1376601703.0,1kg1jo,Some advice for those of you currently working on your secondary essays.,Altare21,17,1,5,"Anyone else feeling burned out yet? I am. It's tough to grind out all of these secondary essays

1. Break the prompt down into sections. What is it asking? This is the most important aspect of writing a good essay. You need to answer the prompt. Often times this comes in the form of  ""describe x experience and how you have grown from it."" There are two parts to this question that you need to address, as the prompts will almost always be slightly different and one essay might not *exactly* answer the the prompt on a different secondary.

2. You have the prompt split into sections. Now make bullet points under each question. For your ""x experience"", and z. Put those in bullet points.

3. Now comes the stream of consciousness. Look at your bullet points and expand them. Just start writing. The important part here is that what you write doesn't even have to make sense. Forget proper grammar and writing in complete sentences. Just write your ideas down while they are in your head

4. Don't be surprised if you now have a chaotic 400 word jumble of an essay in front of you. That's how it should be. From here on out, pay more attention to writing coherently and focus on those important ideas you highlighted. It doesn't need to be perfect, but pay more attention to grammar and spelling now, too.

5. Repeat step 4 until you've whittled down your essay to the desired length. Now it's time for polish, but don't forget about flow. Flow is critical for keeping your reader interested. Pay particular attention to transitions, as well as your first and last sentences. In the example above, the essay was broken up into 2 pieces. There should be a transition that links those two pieces in your essay, or else your essay will switch focus too abruptly. Your final sentence should tie everything together and reflect the overall theme of your essay.

6. Review time. Is your essay the correct length? Does it answer the prompt? Is the grammar/spelling/syntax as perfect as you can make it? Does it flow? If you've answered ""yes"" to each of these questions, your particular style, or writing ability.

So I just got off the phone with New York Medical College. I wanted to see how my late submission would impact my chances. The woman who responded was a very sweet lady who told me that people often have misconceptions about rolling admissions

That being said, who are more ""on top of things"" are more likely to apply early and submit better quality applications. She said they receive more higher quality applications towards the beginning of the application cycle, that's just how it is. She reiterated that these people are more likely to get in due to the quality of their applications, rather than the fact that they submitted early.

If you want further clarification

EDIT: BUSM just gave me a similar answer.

**CLARIFICATION**: You can submit the AMCAS before you get our MCAT scores and LORs (let's say you're taking the Sept MCAT). If you submit in July, as long as you get your LORs by sometime in September, you'll be in the same point in the queue as you'd be if you submitted everything in July. That's because adcoms only start meeting around September, so they look at apps in order of AMCAS submission date usually, so the woman meant that I won't be penalized.... but you might be if you decide to wait until Sept. to submit the whole thing.

First

During my first year of college, and was dismissed from my school. I also had a GPA of around 0.8 between both the semesters until I was kicked out. Yeah, there was quite a bit that went wrong that year.

I went to community college after and did marginally better but had a bunch of withdrawals. I messed around until I eventually just quit it and went to work. I somehow found work being a histotechnician and did the full-time thing there. I also was working on pursuing a career in music with my band at the same time. So that was my life: work and band.

I turned 24 and a bunch of crazy stuff happened that I won't go into detail, after the grade replacement.

I immediately transferred into a 4 year state school. I had nothing going on my first year in the way of EC's

When I graduated with my BS, also, so that went into my AMCAS app.

I had also won some scholarships and awards of course which took up a bit of space on AMCAS. But yes

With the money available to me, but I took it based on my MCAT score. None were Caribbean. I was going to ride out the interview season and see if I should apply to DO schools. I applied in July, as soon as schools were allowing secondaries.

The result was that I got an interview invite almost right away in August. I went to it in October and had my acceptance in November. It was an out of state school that  liked but wasn't my first choice. All other schools except one have thus far rejected me. No other interview invites.

Good to see that there is more to Reddit than cat pictures. heh
I would like to talk to other pre-med students and current medical students about my wife to get an idea about if I am doing the right things for her. A little background might help...

My wife is originally from Latin America but has been in the US as a permanent resident for ~7 years. Her family immigrated here due to the dangers of living in a community run by cartels and corrupt government officials as well as the high rate of kidnapping for ransom. She has been focused on going to medical school for a couple years now and has been accomplishing some really great things for her future application. I have already fulfilled my main career aspirations and have secured a great job in a lucrative field, as well as setting her up with all sorts of opportunities in the medical field for her to gain experience and fuel her passion for the industry.  I coach her every day with any knowledge I glean from my research, and really love to see her get closer and closer to reaching her full potential, something she would have never had a chance to do were it not for her immigration to the USA. 

While my wife excels in the sciences and exhibits a true and obvious passion for the industry I am concerned about her English language skills. More specifically, but I fear her reading comprehension is not up to par, which is somewhat expected as she went through her K-12 years outside of the US. I am adamant in that I will not let this be the reason for her rejection to a school once she applies in the near future. Listed below are actions I have taken to help sharpen her reading comprehension:

- Every day I assign her a random article to read and paraphrase that increases in difficulty as the days pass. 

- I sit down with her and go over the assigned article and help her understand anything she had missed (themes

She has ~18 months before she submits her first application.  I am looking for any advice or even success stories from ESL students

I will aim for a very very good MCAT and study very hard. I look at it as a self test to see if I can do it. 
I had suffered from depression throughout the college years (didn't catch it early) and had to drop all the classes at one point to just get myself up and become functional. I have grown more mature and developed coping strategies. After graduation, and I DO LOVE IT SO MUCH! I plan to study for the MCAT really hard while Im in the Peace Corps. When I return, I want to find a part time job and take more science classes part time for a year to bring the GPA upto 3.0. So that I can at least be at the cut off line, both for some med school (Texas) and for any post-bacc program. 

This is my plan for the next two years to prepare myself for applying for the med school. I am in constant terror of not being able to get it, and I know I will live my life to the fullest as a doctor, helping people (too cheesy..but exactly how I feel..). I am a Texas resident, so my goal will be going to school in Texas due to lower tuition. I would like to avoid being in huge debt as much as possible. I am also thinking about applying for the military medical school scholarship program, but with my low GPA, I am not sure. So fixing the GPA is the priority.

So I got an update from VCU - apparently nobody cared about my outfit (or at least, not what they expected (and they want what they expected).

I think this might be a nice way of saying I rambled

1) What do you do when you're in a group and someone isn't pulling their own weight?
My answer: First I would ask them nicely to start working and tell them how it's unfair that I have to do all the work. If they don't comply, they don't get credit. However it tends to help the situation if I give the person a specific task, because often people don't pull their weight because they don't know where to start as they are daunted by the task. Therefore, it is easier if I tell them ""how about you do the introduction?"" instead of ""you should pull your own weight"" - it's more specific and gives them a distinct start and end point.

2) How do you take criticism?
My Answer: I love getting criticism

3) What do you do when you're in a group and nobody agrees with your idea?
Since it's a team effort, the majority wins unless I have serious ethical qualms about it. 

I feel like question 1 was the hardest because every time I've been in that situation, more conscientious group members pick up the slack. So I have no idea what the ""appropriate"" answer is. ",,False,self,t5_2rlp9,False,,

My school has a limit on how many repeats you can take

Every year, and -- happy times! -- you see your score steadily improve.

About a week to 10 days before your test date, your score drops below what you had gotten just a few days ago. Now the shit hits the fan: Your actual MCAT test date is just a few days away, and you feel like, suddenly, you're in big trouble. You're frightened, worried, frustrated. You feel like you're screwed, which sounds like this:

""Should I reschedule the test date for later?""
""Won't that delay my application?""
""Which means I probably won't get in this year … oh crap!""
""Which means I'll have to wait TWO MORE YEARS to just even START medical school. Oh
""Which means my life is basically over.""
""God … I feel fat.""

That's an example of MCAT panic.

But, you won't have to delay your application, you probably still have an excellent chance of getting in to medical school.

You're not fat.

**The Cause of MCAT Panic**
There's another reason why your MCAT practice test score might have dropped. It's not because you suddenly lost your ability to answer test question; it's not because you have had a micro-stroke and thereby lost your subtle cognitive skills. It's much more likely that you 1) had some very good improvement in your ability which was reflected in an improving trend in your MCAT practice test results, ""I've got this bitch nailed."" (Sorries to all dem bitches outdere. All respect.)

When you sit for that one last, you may have set yourself up. You got a little too confident, a little too cocky, and maybe, just maybe, you got a little sloppy. It doesn't take much, and your score results dip a bit and now you're off into this hellua-spiral-god-my-life-is-over-I'm-never-gonna-get-in.

As my friend Terri says, hard look at your results. I'll bet you a nickel you'll find a few questions - maybe more than just a few - where you were a bit sloppy / hasty / cavalier. 

So instead of freaking out, or not.

I realize it will take a few years to do damage control and show medical schools that I've learned and matured


Here's some further information you may need:
-cGPA: 2.75
-I haven't taken the MCAT yet but I'm starting a course this summer and will have a lot of time to devote to studying.
-I have 100+ hours shadowing a neurologist and a pediatrician
-I've volunteered in clinics both in the US and abroad
-I have at least three strong references and two good ones
-LOTS of research experience in various fields in neuroscience
-other average credentials that don't really make me stand out much


Here are my questions for you all:
-How do I bounce back from the suspension? I'm currently sitting at home struggling to find a job until I apply for readmission. Not having any luck so far.
-With regards to my GPA, or an SMP (if I'm able to get in) after I receive my degree. Is this a good idea? Is there anything else I can do to show adcoms I will be able to handle a rigorous courseload? Please keep in mind that I'm not trying to jump into classes immediately. I still need to work on my depression and motivation issues and I want to work for this next year to show that I'm mature and responsible.


Please don't post and tell me that I'm wasting my time and that I'm a failure and have no chance. I've heard it all from my parents, I'm terrified. I have no idea what my future holds for me and what steps I need to take to get out of this mess. All is know is that I am willing to put in as much time and effort as possible to make my dream a reality.

An occasional lurker of this subreddit coming to you guys with my current situation because I'm not sure who else to ask (my premed advisor's appointments are booked through the end of this week).  As a senior graduating at the end of next month

**Background**

- Asian female... does this matter?  I don't know.

- good MCAT (36)

- good GPA studying hard science at a top 20 uni (4.0 in the past two years

- good ECs (shadowing

- good research (basic science: 2 years, other: abstract and manuscript author and poster presenter for a free clinic's innovative model of blahblahblah)

- unsure about LORs at the moment - nervous about this.

- not really distinguished in my hobbies (no awards in music, etc.)

**Job offers:**

- *(50-75% chance of receiving) Fulbright English Teaching Assistantship in Southeast Asia*

I am scared about this because I will have a lot of responsibility (to independently teach multiple(!) English classes) and I know international flights are pretty expensive during med school interviews.  Seems like it would be fun

- *National Institutes of Health Postbacc IRTA (full-time

I don't know how I landed this job because it requires Matlab (I have *basic* experience), but... other than the programming-all-day part, I don't see any glaring problems and the previous IRTA said research mentorship was excellent at this lab!

- *top 5 academic med center lab tech (50% paid position -- what does this even mean?)*

Research topic is interesting to me and directly related to my undergrad research.  Responsibilities in basic science *and* clinical settings

**My only real goals for my year off are to:**

- ~~pay off my undergrad loans (a couple thousand)~~ just paid them off today!!!! yay!

- learn Spanish well enough to use it medically (optional but a serious goal!)

- hopefully get accepted to my in-state medical school (California)",self,t5_2rlp9,1366743710.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/1cx6fc/postuniversitygraduation_career_advice/

I have decided that I want to pursue medicine as a career. However
I was recently accepted into a PhD program in human physiology that is fully funded, but I would end up about 100K in debt after two years of tuition and living expenses. I also was accepted into a one year post-bacc program at an osteopathic school, but it is just a post bacc and not a masters. 50% of the students from the post bacc go on to enter professional schools, with ""a large percentage"" going to DO schools (from their website).

I wanted to hear some input from you guys and girls. The PhD program is VERY interesting aside from being fully funded. I also am not opposed to having to pursue medical school a little later in life (I would be 29 when I finish the PhD) because of the experience and everything else I would get with it.

1) Take a full course load this quarter along with work

2) Wait until summer between year 3-4 to take the MCAT class and apply as a 4th year. I'll do summer school/research/volunteer during the same summer I take the class.

I had a few friends already tell me that it is not easy to balance MCAT studying and coursework especially with so many EC but I'm concerned about taking a year off for financial reasons.

The general consensus seems to be to just focus on practice tests. Today I went through my whole test question by question. Whether I got it right or wrong I thought about how I came to my answers

Taking the MCAT in 6 weeks. My most recent practice test was a 29. My GPA is not good (3.6ish) so I need to hit a bit higher to be in a good place come application time.

I am a rising junior, even though I have a job.

My scores were PS-8 VR-12 BS-9.

My VR is good. A friend pointed out that you can't really study for that in a matter of weeks. And I figure that it wouldn't really be worth it to try to raise that score since it will really come down to just a few points/lucky questions at that point. 

But my PS and BS definitely could improve.

I am finding that the Chem in the PS section and the Orgo in the BS section are my weakest. But for the most part I can't find anything specific.

When it comes to a specific passage I don't have any hit-or-misses. I usually get 5/6 or 6/8 of the questions right. It is just the one or two other questions that are adding up. I also do pretty good in the non-passage questions.

So I got six weeks

For now I am focusing on switching from doing a lot of reading to doing a lot of practice tests. This was my 3rd practice test kind of. I did one all the way through and got a 26. I did a 2nd one, went over it, etc.

This latest was my 3rd test

Sorry this is kind of vague. But I know all of the juniors/rising seniors likely just finished their MCATs and could maybe offer advice.

The physicians I've talked to and the internet searching I've done paints this picture of ""go into medicine only if it's what you've always wanted to do, I like learning, I like the idea of having a relatively secure career, I like the idea of not working at a desk' (as opposed to say academia which for what I'm good at seems to be all the toil of getting an MD with no light at the end of the tunnel).

On top of **that, and I think my GPA this semester will be somewhere between a 2.5 and a 3.0 (didn't apply myself at all, only recently found a decent friend group due to social difficulty of not drinking or partying in a very ""bro""-y dorm, plus standard 'adjusting to college' stuff.).

I don't have any questions on the entry into medical school, I just want to get to know my peers a little better. What experiences have further enhanced your desire to become a physician? I will start. ",imstillhereok,9

Okay, I know in my heart that the true power of change lies in the ability to relate to others through stories. I am not one to brag. I have so much potential, just like you do. Just like anyone does. But, what have I done with this conceptualized potential? Not too much. It’s time that I cash in potential energy into kinetic energy—as a physicist might say. the energy never goes away, but it’s how we convert it and put it to use. 

So here is a story that I love to reflect on. It has nothing really to do with me other than the fact that I am the passive observer

Last summer of July (so in 2011) I shadow a doctor. He is an infectious disease specialist. You can probably infer that I shadow this man because I aspire to be a physician one day. I meet him with a brief handshake and a smile. We immediately begin to walk—this is critical. We waste no time sitting down

He wastes no time to get to his first patient, he greets with a brief hello accompanied by a wonderful smile. He talks with me about who I am, what I like to do, and what my goals are for the immediate future. We see our first patient and he checks on his blackberry the blood cell counts of this sickly man. Here is a man with an extreme case of Pseudomonas. This is a disease that has stricken the man in such a way that most of his body’s vital organs have failed him. He is in an ICU room with several machines surrounding his exterior as if they are the only friends that will put a shoulder on him as he takes his last breaths of air. The doctor knows that this man has a slim chance, but only thinks of ways to improve his health, to better this man, to hopefully one day regain his consciousness. 

We make a few more rounds, an infected chest. He sees a woman looking to get out of the hospital to enjoy her life, a spirited woman with a wise-cracking sense of humor that is determined to regain her knees, and a boy with a desire to get out of the children’s oncology ward by beating leukemia and live a regular teenage life with his friends and go to school. This strikes me. Every doctor will consider what is wrong with the patient and attempt to fix that problem, but the great doctor sees the person as more important than the problem.

We visit a few more local hospitals. The most interesting case? As we visit one of our last patients, the man that he just spoke with was in bad shape. He had an infection in his back, right by his spine. It is commonly reported that this particular disease the man had would be responsible for making all people scream in pain and agony because the pain was unbearable and intolerable. The man had at once considered his acceptance to die. The infectious disease doctor told me that he did all that he could to treat him back to great health, and here he is today—ten years later—remembering the doctor that saved his life and sincerely congratulating him for his help and assistance. 

Most freshman want to enter the medical field because they search for aspirations that their parents place on them. They want to seek success for themselves. They want to demonstrate their abilities and egos. Some sadly enter for the money. This shadowing experience that I reflect upon has been one of many examples that reinforce the fact that a great physician is one whose true currency is the amount of people that he can help. It is indicative of the underlying philosophy that the well should take care of the sick. It is genuine. It is truthful. It is something that I aspire to be one day, regardless of what they aspire to become.

**Extracurriculars**

* PLTL Leader 3 semesters - Led group of freshman in learning about bio
* PLTL supervisor - supervised leaders that led their classes
* Children's hospital volunteer 1 year
* Camp counselor for kids with rheumatologic disorders for 2 summers.
* President of health organization at my university for a year. 

**Research**

* Undergrand Research assistant 6+ months. Doing research at my university with kids that have been diagnosed with ADHD.

**Work Experience**

* Working as medical scribe for 1+ year. Lots of patient and clinical experience. Working in the ER with physicians on a very close level.

I'll be applying to around 20 or so schools. 12 of those will be MD and the rest will be DO. After working in the ER with lots of MD's and DO's I've realized that there is absolutely no difference between the two.

* MD: 3.2 cGPA

* DO: 3.4cGPA

Right now I am scheduled to take the MCAT on May 31st. My thinking was that I could review the material over this semester...but that didn't happen. Between Biochem and Psychopathology, and tutored chemistry last semester. I also made sure I was taking somewhat MCAT-useful classes, like Biology of Aging where physiology was reviewed. 

So far I only took 3FLs, 24, 29. 29 was from a Kaplan free testing thing they were holding at the uni, and it was shorter than other FLs.

So I am thinking I should move my MCAT back a couple weeks if my scores are not in at least the 30's range 1-2 weeks before the date. What that means is that I would be getting my scores in mid July

I start college in the fall and I know I want to go to med school. I've taken some neuroscience classes and it's my passion, I'll have better access to a hospital that accepts all kinds of volunteers, but not during my freshman and sophomore year. A friend of mine suggested calling up local neurologists and surgeons and seeing if I can volunteer in their offices, which would mean I would shadow them occasionally as well. I already plan on being a part of the Medshare program, but I'm wondering, is this enough volunteering to get into a good medical school?

Having two years of college left, however these school's sites have been ambiguous as to whether lab matters for biochemistry or not. My school offers two versions of biochemistry: one through the Biology department and one through the Chemistry department. Both are intended for students that are majoring in their respective departments. The only difference I could see is that the chem version has a lab and the bio one does not. I, as a bio major, am taking the bio version without lab (though there is an extra hour once per week where the class is broken down into smaller groups and primary literature is discussed, but this in no way constitutes a lab). I was wondering how big of a difference it would make if I took the bio version instead of the chem version. 

Were I to take the chem version, I would lose my other minor (which I have only taken one class for so far, but still). 

I know that looking only at the top schools is unrealistic for any applicant, research, etc etc so I would definitely not like to be at a disadvantage when it comes to classes when I apply in a year. 

I definitely am going to talk to a premed adviser about these concerns as well but I felt it prudent to also ask this subreddit as I'm sure many people here have helpful advice or can point me towards more questions I should be asking an adviser.

My college advising is horrible...,batmanlight,7,1,8,"Hey guys- are there any pre med advisors or guidance counselors or even anyone who have experience with a student who doesnt have a strong transcript and have a couple of specific problems that they'd like to ask about?

EDIT: I don't mind asking you guys what your opinions are- I'll try and make it short.

one of my Pre- Helth advisors told me I was a waste of an applicant.

My current status is as follows- I graduated form a community with 3.7 gpa deans list and honor roll with Associates in L.A. I went to, my transcript is atrocious with every other class having a withdrawal ""W"" on it, a C in calculus and one F# in chem 1 because I was hospitalized early in the class, (they dont want to do anything about it but i MIGHT be able to change that to a ""W"") but retook that chem 1 class and received a B in it.

so My transcript will look like W W A W B B+ W A- B W B W etc.. it's very inconsistant and sporadic and my gpa overall is a 3.5 as well as my science. I also haven only taken the required pre reqs and nothing beyond the full 1 year of bio

I will JUST be done with those pre reqs this coming fall 2013 and would love to take the MCATs that following spring (Jan feb march).

I am very realistic with my situation and I plan on applying to nursing/PT/PA programs as well as medical schools but I dont want to go down without a fight.

now here are some of my questions-
1. How badly are the W's going to look/affect me?
2. Should I take more science classes out of the realm of just the pre reqs to either boost my sGPA or to help my chances.
3. Is it even a good idea to take the MCATs next spring with all things considering?
4. should I not even take the MCATs yet and maybe graduate with my english major from Hunter and maybe enroll into a Masters program to again

So basically I just want to see if what I'm planning out would be a good way of going about getting in to med school. 

So first a little of my background so far. I am a senior in Molecular Biology and a minor in Chemistry, mostly it was being lazy my freshman/sophomore year before I really knew I wanted to do med school. But it was also that I have ADHD and didn't get diagnosed until the summer before my junior year (last year).  Last year I did really well (both semester's GPA above 3.2), and I'm doing well again this year.  I also have my EMT-B license and have over 400 hours of volunteer experience with patient contact (I'm in an EMS club at my university and we have tons of volunteer opportunities).  I am also helping teach an EMT-B course through said club right now.  I haven't taken the MCAT yet as I've been trying to focus on my school work and volunteering, but I plan on taking it this coming summer. I've also shadowed a few doctors too.

So here's what I was planning on doing.  I'm thinking of taking a year off from school and working on an ambulance to make some money.  During this ""year off"" I want to apply to some GPA boosting post-bacc programs so I can prove that I can handle the tough course load of medical school.  Then assuming I get into a program

Around this time last year

A few weeks went by and I received another phone call to set up my second interview at another school. It was the last interview I received. I was rejected from my dream school (the first phone call) and wait listed near the middle of the second school. 

I've spent the last few weeks preparing another application and was about to submit my application later today when I received a phone call. Of all the schools I applied to

I know applications were open for submission beginning yesterday so to those of you who are applying this year: GOOD LUCK! 

There will be many days where you may question yourself. There may be times when it seems like your dream will never come to fruition or you may feel that you aren't good enough. It's a competitive process but I urge you to use whatever emotion you're feeling, let's go research the school and fill that sucker out! Feeling down about the whole process? That means now's the time for action! Let's go! Be methodical, efficient, and patient. Make sure you pace yourself because if you're like me (most of you will have a much easier time than I did), you could be in the race for a while. Keep calm. Don't panic.

When you're working on a secondary or preparing for an interview, looking for jobs, etc.). Definitely pick up a hobby in the meantime, it will keep you sane and provide an outlet. There will be plenty of waiting. I put on a few pounds in college so I got a gym membership and started working out with a small group of friends. It feels amazing and we're all better people because of it.

3.78/4.0 gpa. Chemistry major/music minor.

29 MCAT (11 PS

I've been working in a chemistry research lab since sophomore fall (including summers). I'm second author on a recent publication and am hoping to have 1-2 more by the time I graduate. I'm also planning on doing an honors thesis on my research. 

I'm a rower for my school and will have done it all four years. 

I'm in a sorority and have held officer positions and have done lots of volunteer and philanthropy work. 

I've shadowed many different doctors in a shadowing program through my school (about 50ish hours)

I was a violinist in the school orchestra for two years. I've played piano since I was five.

I participated in a mentoring program for two years helping high schoolers through the college application process. 


I've spent a lot of time recently trying to decide what to do in my year between undergrad and medical school. My question is will what I do in that year matter to my application? I will be submitting my primary application in early June 2014

I know I want to do something in my gap year that will enhance my application, like being a medical scribe or assistant. I don't think I can have a job like that while still in school given a busy schedule. I figure that I can do some long-term volunteering my senior year of college as it won't be as demanding time-wise. I worry though that by waiting to gain more in depth clinical experience until after my primary is sent will hurt me. Is there anywhere on secondaries that ask about gap year activities? I figure it will come up in interviews, but I need to get interviews first :)

Keep in mind I just finished my sophomore year.


Pros and cons for each:

*If I take it at the end of this summer (Aug/Sep):*

**PROS:**

1. I will have a 3 month block of dedicated study time (I want to follow SN2ed's program) leading up to the test
2. the material from the pre-reqs will be fresher in my head (I have finished them all as of this semester)
3. I'll have ample time to retake if necessary
4. I'll know my score sooner

**CONS:**

1. I haven't taken a few courses which would help a lot (I'll get to those below)
2. I don't have a completely empty summer (I'd like to shadow/volunteer a bit
3. I don't have all the materials needed for SN2ed as of now (lacking TBR which I heard can take a while to get)
4. Grade could possibly expire (not likely though)

*If I take it at the end of winter break (Jan)*


**PROS:**

1. I will have taken Biochem, and an Anatomy Lab (all enrolled for this upcoming fall semester)
2. I'll have more time to work on my reading speed (I read pretty slowly) this summer as well as brush up on content
3. I'll have more time to shadow and volunteer
4. The summer will be way more enjoyable :P

**CONS:**

1. I have an entire fall semester courseload to deal with so I can't study NEARLY as much as I want to until December 18 (biggest con being I probably won't be able to do SN2ed :/ )
2. I will be a year (or more) removed from nearly all of the prereq classes 
3. I will only have one month of dedicated study time
4. I'll likely forget any material I study this summer by then


I have read that 3 months is ideal because after that you likely won't remember what you studied before then

Some additional information.... I messed up my freshman year and had a cummulitive of 2.8 but every semester since then I improved my gpa by at least .1 and usually by .3 the following semester. I transfered to Georgia Tech where I have a cummulitive of a 3.4 and hopefully will get a good gpa this year. As far as EC I have experience in a Hospital, Shadowing,  and various helping the neighbor hood events and I do have a few hobbies. I have undergraduate research as well. My letters are being written by two physicians, who know me well, that I have shadowed and by my PI, who I have been taught by and researched with for a semester, as well. My goal school is Medical Collge of Georgia.

I'm trying to decide which medical school I should go to, Mac, Queens, Ottawa and Western. I've tentatively ruled out Western, Queens, since they're not big city centers, and I don't think I would get exposure to the same kind of interesting medical cases that I might in a major urban area with a top-of-the-line hospital, but wouldn't the complex cases just get referred somewhere else?)

I've tentatively ruled out McMaster as well, that I need, and might make it more difficult to match to competitive specialties (like neurosurgery or anaesthesiology).

So it seems to come down to McGill vs. UofT. Can anyone weigh in? I've done my undergrad at McGill

Pros for UofT:

Full-body

Tons of affiliated hospitals and research

~5-6k non-repayable grant per year

Parents and highschool friends live nearby

Cons:

Really large class

Costs a lot more than McGill

Lots of lectures

Perhaps not as much patient contact until rotations

Pros for McGill:

Also a good research center

New curriculum

Practicing medicine in English and French

Lower cost of living than in Toronto

Cons:

Lower amount of loans from OSAP

More mandatory-attendance tutorials instead of lectures which are recorded (so I wouldn't have to be there)

Would I have to practice in Quebec afterwards? If not

Somewhat worse hospital system than in Ontario

Any issues with me being an Out-of-province student?



There are probably tons more factors to consider

I have spent some time volunteering at clinics/hospitals and I feel like medicine is something I really enjoy being part of.

The other major issue is the grading, because it isn't, I find that the profs just tend to care less about grading because the majority of their students don't have aspirations outside of engineering (""A b+ is a great grade! good for you....."" style of thinking) How can those grades compete to get into med schools with those who average A/A+'s, I have taken courses outside my faculty and ended up with A/A+ marks.

A quick background about myself: 

-Age - 28
-Married with a baby boy on the way in June
-English Education Degree from Auburn in 2007 with a GPA of 3.02
Rough freshman and sophomore years - got my act together junior and senior years  
-Been teaching English with ESL and special ed inclusion since January 2008.  
-Rather accomplished musician with a lot of experience teaching and performing
-Wife works full time and wants to continue working even after having the baby
- I'll be quitting teaching at the end of this year to focus on getting into medical school

I'm currently taking a statistics class as a postbacc.  I need to take all of my pre-med science courses, and no shadow experience.  No research experience either.  

Here's what my premed advisor suggested:  

- Take classes as a postbacc with a maximum of two per semester and one per summer and of course
- Get a job that makes money in the least amount of time.  I can make $1400/month on teaching guitar alone just two days a week.  She said not to worry about clinical experience with my job. 
- Get involved with a volunteer organization at least once a week.  Should be something I enjoy and feel connected to and not something that is necessarily ""clinical.""  
- Shadow doctors - as many as possible
- Score at least a 32 on the MCAT
- Kick ass in the interview

She claims that my teaching experience and my voluntary decision to teach ESL and special ed inclusion will do a lot in terms of impressing the adcoms and enables me to spend less time on getting clinical hours volunteering and more time on other things.  

She also said that research isn't necessary in my case.  

My plan is to see if I can use my guitar teaching to help me volunteer somewhere.  Either at a local hospital as a teacher/performer or volunteering at an autism center and giving autistic kids guitar lessons.  

Here are my questions: 

1.  I'm thinking about going full time as a student and pursuing a neuroscience degree.  For one, which is still really low.  Neuroscience classes (with a 4.0) will bring it up to a 3.35, which is still relatively low, but it will give me more of an upward trend.  Also, it'll be nice to have something tangible in hand when I'm finished instead of just a bunch of pre-med classes.  Good idea or no? 

2.  Is my volunteer idea sufficient

3.  Do you agree that my experience as an English teacher helps me get past the initial cut off?  

I'm shooting for UAB medical school or South Alabama if that helps.

 [U]Personal Story:
[/U]

I came to the US when I was 15 as an illegal immigrant. My family and I did not enter the country illegally but we were not supposed to stay and we did. My family is  made up of my mother (single mother) and my younger sister. We survived with my mother's under the table salary while my sister and I finished high school. After high school my mother was able to get a work visa so I was able to get a social security and apply to college. However, I wanted to be a Doctor. The marriage ended but I was able to get my Green Card out of the deal so it was not a total waste of time. After the green card, I qualified for Financial Aid so I was able to work less time to still help my family financially but I did not have to pay for school. As I started taking upper division courses I applied for a Work Study research position at a lab in my School where I stayed for 4 years. This research experience and the fact that I was working on my own project got me the “honors” of my degree. After I graduated, I was not able to apply right away because I wanted to return the favor and have my mother go back to school (In the US for her masters) She was by then a resident as well so she was able to go to college. While she was in school she started working PT and  worked FT as a Science Teacher for in a low income, low performance, 100% minority Middle School . With my teacher’s salary I was able to support my mother and sister while they were both in college. I was also able to increase my student’s passing score in the state’s science test by 75% .   I currently switched to working as a medical Scribe in an ER and both my mother and sister are 1 semester away from graduation!  We all 3 will become citizens at the end of this month and despite the struggle, all the sacrifices and the suffering, I would have never revealed the fact that I stayed in this country illegally or that I got my green card through marriage. The only motivation I had to even post this is a recent episode of the show NY med where one of the surgeons openly revealed having entered this country illegally.  
 Is this subject still taboo? Is it important to mention it in my personal statement? It is the main reason why I am on the “low end” of the GPA scale for med schools. Working almost FT and studying FT was exhausting and some days I just did not have any energy left in me. I don’t know how to better explain this.  Any advice of previous applicants is appreciated

I have been toying with the idea for a long time of applying to medical school. Coincidentally, health administration, and humanitarian work all of which I have pretty considerable work experience.

My background is actually in mathematics and statistics, and triaging of high end imaging for breast cancer. I've since worked with an HMO doing practice based assessment of performance and with clinical trials doing randomization, statistical analysis, manuscripts, etc.

A wealthy friend of the family had heard me speak of medical school and was tremendously supportive. Much to my surprise, smiled tremendously and said, ""Your family needs at least one doctor, absolutely!""

The one hurdle I see in all this is that I have practically no lab science experience. I got a straight 4 in my physics sequence but that was all that was required for my program and I had focused on other things. Given that I'm not as interested in practice, or evaluation.

My biggest drive in all this is that I feel I'm a creative person and I like to do much out of love. I do enjoy quantitative work, I think this stuff is tremendously cool. I've always tried to go above-and-beyond what was required in terms of my medicine/biology knowledge. I hound wikipedia and google scholar for medical studies and outcomes and knowledge about new genetic tests and biomarkers for rare disease and all this really cool stuff.

1338935416.0,umums,Looking for some help,kalat,5,0,5,"Hey guys

I'm currently a sophomore student pursuing an undergraduate degree in neuroscience with a minor in psychology. My program covers the majority of the premedicine requirements including the introductory chemistry, and calculus with the exception of the two semesters of organic and, my school recommended, 5 hours of biochemistry. I've been working in a neuropsychological laboratory with children on adaptive executive functioning, and I've had a large amount of exposure to the graduate neuroscience and psychology department, but I've mostly scrapped any plans to pursue graduate study in neuroscience. Additionally, I've become somewhat jaded with the graduate psychology programs (I know many of these share thin lines in their distinctions). I will suffix this with the fact that I am continuing to love my undergraduate curriculum however.

My university is very research oriented, simply due to discounting my own ability, ambition, or financial means, but moving forward, it is increasingly becoming something that I feel would be a fantastic and possibly very viable option for my goals. I should note I took two years off after high school to figure out what I wanted and take some odd jobs before starting my undergraduate.

Now that I've given somewhat of a very brief and aesthetic view of where I'm at, and I haven't necessarily been planning for medical school. Is this okay? My GPA is okay at the moment, a 3.5 going up, I made a 3.75 last semester with a large class load. I can probably stabilize it around a 3.6 by the time I graduate. I will have research experience, probably two years or three years when I graduate, but my only other healthcare experience is a short-lived stint as a pharmaceutical technician earlier when I started school. There's two major hospitals nearby including one which I'm already with in the research, but I haven't really made use of them (Is shadowing actually worth it..?). What should I be doing?

Anyways, and will take a couple of other courses perhaps). GPA wise, I'm okay. 2.8 first year, 3.8 second year, 3.9 in years 3 and 4, each being full course load. 

Through the 4 years, this lead to potential careers such as med school (neurology/psychiatry), neuropsychology, or grad school in neuroscience. In the last year or so, I decided that I would like to apply to a MSc program in Neuroscience up here in Canada, but come 2012, I ran into the same problems of not knowing what I really wanted, bought some other material and will be taking the MCAT come August.

Here is what I see as the problem, play a few instruments etc, but only personal things, no institution or anything like that where I can say I volunteered at (like a hospital). No clubs, nothing. I don't bore you with details, but some personal issues stood in my way of really getting out there and getting social/volunteering/making connections, which I'm currently getting some help with.

Now, and no EC's, I feel that I won't be able to get into any med school even with a decent MCAT score for the year 2013.

I see myself with two options:

1) Don't apply to anything this upcoming fall, to help with my resume, and apply in fall 2013 and if all goes right, get in for the year 2014, where I'll be 24.

2) Apply for a MSc Neuroscience

I think the biggest hurdle that comes with the lack of ECs is the idea of age. I know a few people who got into med school right after graduation (age 22), but comparing myself to others has been a personal downfall for some time. Feel like garbage to be honest.

I recently graduated from university with a bachelors degree in engineering (back in November). unfortunately I graduated with a B- average (a 2.7 on a 4.0 scale). this was due to a couple factors:

* I found it hard to transition from high school to university in my first year
* I was not really motivated to do exceptionally well

my first year was a disaster. I averaged a 2.5 (C+) because I found it really hard to go from high school to university. as I went onto 2nd

I'm really interested in becoming a MD, I have a 70% average. I still have to go back and do my pre-reqs for med school. assuming I do that (also assuming I do somewhat well in those courses), and I do a couple of elective courses, I can bump up my GPA to around a B average (which is 74% in their conversion tables).

now moving on to my MCAT. if I do really well on it (assuming I get somewhere in the mid-upper 30's)

I'm currently a sophomore at a very competitive college (top-30) and I'm starting to see my future collapse around me. I've always wanted to be a doctor, may go on a service trip by the end of my time here, probably going abroad this summer, and can get a research position if I want somewhere in my bio department). Like everyone else that's in hot water, it's my GPA that's holding me back.

The problem started right off the bat freshman year. Looking back, and B+'s in my science classes, and when you throw in a C 2 semesters for spanish (a requirement) and you get my GPA after my first year of being 3.079 with a 3.092 science GPA. Now at this point, I'm upset but not overly worried. I've heard of first year slumps and I wasn't too concerned. It's this semester that's really hit me hard.

I came into this semester determined to work harder than I've ever had, come grades, I got an inexplicable B- in orgo, and B+ in my lab, and a B in my cell bio class (the B- and B are what both of those classes are curved to). I honestly was expecting at least a grade higher in each class with how high I was above the curve on many of the tests (9, 10, 13 points on many occasions). I got A's in my non-science classes

This is why I'm feeling so lost. I put SO much work in this semester and got nothing for it. I feel like my grades on tests improve each semester but I have no final grades to show for it. Time is running out, with an A in my orgo lab then I'll have a 3.258 science GPA. Is that even realistic though? If I worked as hard as I did last semester and could only manage what I got, how can I expect A's ever? I've lost every ounce of confidence in my body, and I just feel like I never get the grades I expect.

1376092032.0,1k25tp,Advice on when to take the MCAT?,gasbait,4,1,4,"Hi guys

This is my first time posting on this subreddit

So here's my situation: 

I am a rising junior, but no clinical experience yet, and I haven't taken the MCAT yet. 

So the dilemma I'm facing is I don't know whether I should take the MCAT in the spring or fall of 2014. This decision is made even more complex because I know the format will change in 2015. The way I see it

**Spring**

Advantages: 

* If I do badly

* The pre-reqs will be a little bit fresher in my mind. 

* Won't have to apply later in the cycle and/or take a gap year. 

Disadvantage: 

* Will have to study for the MCAT while juggling school (though my course load will be kept light if I do this.)

* Can't use this time to get clinical hours

**Summer**

Advantages: 

*Will have 3 months of undivided attention to study for the MCAT

Disadvantages: 

*Only have one chance to do well

*Might have to apply later in the cycle

First, major specific GPAs are 3.20 and 3.35 respectively though). I have all my med pre-reqs in order except a year of biology and lab.

I have about 1.5 years of research experience (6 months of which was full time), but do not have any shadowing experience (yes I know this is extremely important and I'm working on it).

I guess my main question is: do I stand any shot at acceptance without doing the post-bacc program? Am I also a good candidate for doing a post-bacc? Will I be readily accepted into a post-bacc program is what I am mainly wondering. Anyway,False,self,t5_2rlp9,False,,,t3_1i2h3h

I'm currently picking between two SMPs: Loyola MAMS and Wayne State BMS

Loyola MAMS has a better track record and boasts of a 80-90% acceptance rate into MD school

So on paper Loyola is a better program.  But how much does it really matter?  Do MD addcomms really care what program I went to as long as I get good grades in relevant classes?

Where do I find out about the real problems in healthcare?  I see the lack of accessibility, abuse of emergency rooms without access to primary care, socio-economic factors influencing quality of healthcare as some of my major issues in America today.  I feel I need to broaden my knowledge base (however I already read the A.C.A about 3 times) so hopefully it would be about how it's changing the frontier of medicine.

I had wanted to go to med school when I finished my BS but I was nowhere near qualified- shitty GPA, I'm going to end up with a life of regret and mediocrity.

Through some skill and lucky breaks (my overall GRE score was 99.9th %ile), take a year at the end to finish my pre-requisites (they're not finished, and the ones I did take will be 10-15 years old by then), take the MCAT, and apply to med school.

In the meantime, I'll be working on my PhD full time at a well-respected SPH.  Despite being a SPH, my program is actually very bench-science oriented.  I'm in contact with a church of my denomination (UU) and a Kiwanis Club I plan to join once I get to the New Orleans, so I don't have any concerns about community involvement.  I've thought about seeing if I can find a way to shadow a physician, but I have no idea how to go about finding that or arranging it.  I'm aware I need a recommendation from a DO for osteopathic school, though.  I've worked with plenty of MDs in research, but no DOs.  Seems that DOs don't work outside of patient care as often as MDs.

For my background:  BS Biology, but I've never taken a standardized test and not scored in the 99th percentile.  I'm also a former educator and have worked in exam prep.
