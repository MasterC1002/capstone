1369159353.0,1erzsz,My roommate and I tested our palates with a blind taste test last night.,LetThereBeR0ck,58,6,19,"I've been getting into Scotch lately and bought a bottle of Chieftain's Strathisla 10 Year on the recommendation of one of the owners at a nearby liquor store. I tried it

The six whiskies we sampled:

* Chieftain's Strathisla 10 Year

* Macallan 12 Year

* Bowmore Legend

* Talisker 18 Year

* Crown Royal Cask 16 (Canadian blended whiskey)

* Jameson Original (Irish Whisky)

I poured about 1oz in each of 6 identical glasses and put a splash of water in each to prevent the alcohol content from interfering with the tasting as much. The glasses were labeled 1-6 and I recorded which was which on a notepad. My roommate, recorded which letter corresponded with which number and removed the numbers, all in my absence. Thus, neither of us knew which letter went with which whisky.

I gave my roommate the glasses in a random order to taste and he guessed which whisky each glass contained while I recorded his answers. He then did the same for me. We each made every effort not to look at the glasses we were tasting so the color wouldn't give it away

My roommate got all six correct. I did not fare so well. Of the six, and that my Crown Royal Cask 16 is my favorite of the lot. I was pleasantly surprised to find that I liked the Chieftain's about as much as the Macallan. The biggest surprise was that I identified the Talisker 18 as Jameson, and liked it the least of the lot. 

So I gained some insight about what I like and don't like about different whiskies

And how did I learn this story? Rob Samuels told it to me.  The current COO of Makers Mark told an audience the story of his whiskey's birth and went on to explain how it's still hand crafted.  He told us that the recipe and manufacturing techniques mattered.  And in an audience of whiskey drinkers it didn't take much to convince anyone.  We were on his side and we appreciated that he understood. 

But the recipe is really only 60 years old. Is it old enough to be held as that sacred?  It is only because they told us it is.  Makers has claimed that their hand crafted process, more unique, and initially more expensive (their marketing campaign was based on their high price).

So they have violated my trust,,False,,t5_2r06y,False,,True

Also tried were chai and rum, Earl Grey and scotch (The United Kingdom), Roasted Chestnut tea with Crown Royal Maple, white wine mulled with our local tea store's spiced tea blend (black tea, cinnamon, cloves, some other stuff), Lipton with Two Gingers whiskey - but fear not
We also just tried some of the random teas we picked up before the party from the previously mentioned local tea store. My new favorite being a cherry green tea.

Then we played Cards Against Humanity and laughed until it hurt.

Thanks a lot for all of your recommendations. I'd have to say that all of the drinks maintained their tea flavor rather well. Everything was just brewed normally
If you guys are interested, and the rest of us who already love tea found even more flavors/blends we like with or without alcohol.

1359055920.0,177fq5,How to evaluate whiskey,adremeaux,44,13,4,"I wrote this up a couple years ago

Try to describe these characteristics when evaluating scotch, etc:

Appearance: What does it look like? Color. ""Legs"" (for wine, artificial color like JD or Cuervo? An older drink will often (not always) be darker than a newer one. Certain types of barrel finishes, such as Pedro Ximenez sherry, will darken the scotch significantly.

Nose/Aroma: How does it smell? This is often the most distinct part of a scotch. Place your nose a decent length away from the glass and slowly move forward (while smelling) until you get the alcohol burn. You don't want that, then go in for the real aroma test. Take small sniffs, big ones, long and slow ones, etc. Anything that comes to you, write it down. If your nose becomes fatigued, come back to it a couple minutes later, it is the best part!

Palate: How does the wine/whisky/beer feel in the mouth? Thickness of body. Alcohol burn. Intensity of flavor. Smoothness. Sweetness. Acidity. Bitterness. Does it make your mouth feel dry? Warm? This is specifically how it feels in the mouth

Flavor: How does it taste? Quite difficult with whiskys due to their strength, but that's tough with scotch. Take a slow sip. If you can, inhale and exhale through your nose while holding it in your mouth. Again, write down any descriptors that come to you. Take a fast sip; see if you get anything different.

Finish: After you finish your sip

Overall: What are your distinct impressions? Sometimes you'll come up with a huge list of descriptors but still not like the dram. Sometimes you'll come up with nothing and still adore it.

So

Yesterday I tried the Maker's Mark clean, to see if I can distinguish between them.  Interestingly, I basically grew up in a family that loved to drink Jack Daniels (and sometimes Jim Beam), so I am familiar with the whiskey milieu.  I even got to drink some as a youngster during sporting events (Whenever the Avalanche would score a goal in the Stanley Cup).  So, I am excited to branch out a little more, and try some different things.  I was fortunate enough to try some Pappy Van Winkle 15yr last week when a bunch of coworkers went out to a whiskey bar, and I think that is what finally convinced me that I might like whiskey as an adult (a few years back, and didn't much care for it).

I'm new to this r/Whiskey and looking for guidance in whisky appreciation.

In brief

I have taken to Jameson, It is a little strong neat and I've not quite adjusted to the harsher taste quite yet! (I like the fact is relaxing and longer lasting than most drinks on a night out). What can I do to help change this, what lower range Whiskeys are more palatable to the less experienced sippers? 

Today I've bought a bottle of Whyte &amp; Mackay Special ( a double marriaged blended scotch whisky) How should I enjoy this? 
They say the glass is everything is this style suitable as my primary [vessel](http://mildconcern.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Jameson-Irish-Mule-2.png?) ?

As a quick guide
Jameson - I like
Paddy - Not so much
JD - I dunno why just not my style
Southern Comfort - I know it is not a whiskey as such but I'm quite fond of this with a slice of Lime.

I have a sweet tooth so is there any particular combination that will ease me into whisky while not loosing its finer qualities?

I was first introduced to the King Cube when I was at bar and ordered an Old Fashioned(this bar makes the best one in the city and I had to get one). When I got the drink it had ONE MASSIVE ICE CUBE in it. I asked the bartender why they use it.

He told me that any whiskey drink that requires ice got a king cube because of how slow the ice melted. This resulted in a whiskey drink that was chilled and very little water entering the drink.

I'm also getting an ice sphere mold as a gift. Just a cheap one not the $800 ones and will do a review of that once I get to try it in a drink or two.

 1. whiskey stones - they seem good but inappropriate for a Glencairn glass because you want a high ratio of stones to whiskey volume to get a good chill
 2. on the rocks (for cheap whiskey?)
 3. stirred with an ice cube then served without the ice cube (up style? how do you order it this way ""Id like a knob creek served up?"" 
 4. diluted with chilled bottle water
 5. very chilled mixers (triple sec/coke again for cheaper whiskeys only? on the knob creek website is a suggestion to add a  splash of triple sec.. seems ok but also like a waste of perfectly fine knob creek!)


Out of all of these methods the one i like the most is method 3. 
It 

* chills whiskey without over chilling it
* dilutes the whiskey without over diluting it
* simultaneously
* requires a second cup

what is this method called? what are your favorite ways to drink? which ones are great neat? if its &gt; 80 proof do you dilute for taste? ",,t5_2r06y,1343751720.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/whiskey/comments/xg89c/chilling_my_whiskey_some_questions/

I asked the the bartender what it was and she described it as peaty and very smoky.  Being quite familiar with Laphroaig it struck a chord so I ordered a glass neat.  I was not prepared...

While I waited for the order I looked up the bottle on my phone and saw that it was distilled on Islay and every review touted its glory.  When I took my first sip I immediately noticed that it actually tasted less smokey than my experiences with Laphroaig 10yr.  However, with a very complex blend of harsh and pleasant flavors from start to finish.  This was perhaps the most full-bodied whisky I've ever had.  I liked that, since some people (read: most of my friends) complain about the overwhelming flavor of smoke in Laphroaig.  This drink offers quite a bit more variety in flavor

  As for the bottle
This past weekend, my grandparents purchased the house from said relatives. My uncle and father were both raised in that house. During my father's childhood, he remembered a man (he his unable to recall who he was) that would every so often pull this bottle from a closet, take a swig and promptly put it back inside the closet. My father was only a few years old at the time. Well over time, the bottle was forgotten, until my dad discovered it again this past weekend. 

  Here are pictures of the bottle: [the bottle](http://imgur.com/a/HvPSm#1)
The bottle says ""1934"", thus making its contents (at the start of the aging process) from 1925, which means it was created during the alcohol prohibition in America (the earlier makes more sense, logically).

I'm also not planning to be a snob. I like Scotch but don't want to limit myself to that. In addition to those grandpa memories, and elsewhere, as much as I do those who stayed behind. In short: I'm a British colonial mutt and I'll be proud to drink like one.

So, learn a bit more by tasting a variety of the world's whiskeys in one sitting. I'd like to end the evening with all of us knowing some history through the lens of whiskey-making, and having maybe a tiny bit more of an informed palate the next time we drink a whiskey of any kind. Overall I'd like to have a selection that will help people explore two types of inquiry:
- What does one good whiskey
- How does this whiskey compare to those in other styles?

Budget: I don't want to make this into a life-defining avocation. General off-the-shelf availability in US liquor stores is a plus. Life is too short to drink the cheap stuff from the bottom shelf, just willing to spend a little extra. I'd like to get out of this for under $300. That's part of the reason I'm willing to spend a year preparing: I just don't have a lot of money to spend on this, and not all at once. Perhaps things go on sale? Perhaps I'll be travelling and have opportunities to shop around? I need a shopping list I can keep in my wallet, with an idea of what will be good price.

So, and fit within my budget.

Starting list of destinations (feel free to suggest amendments):
Scotch (this seems to cover a *lot* of stylistic territory so willing to have more than one

Um

TLDR: Looking for an affordable list of good representative whiskeys to do a ""world tour"" beginners' tasting party.

Also I was reading more about the shapes of whiskey glasses and came across some article that said the traditional ones (the straight up and down cups with thick bottoms) are actually not the right shape and they showed some glass that looked like a wine glass which they said was better is this true?

Can anyone think of any other whiskey related stuff he might like?

It may not be the finest whiskey out there, what time it is, or how hung over you might be, you can always get the same tasty burrito supreme and soft tacos you had 20 years ago. And all for only a few bucks. Bang for your buck people. JD has it in spades.

Recommended: Yes
Notes: Smokey with definite charcoal taste. A little ice/water rounds it out nicely with a smooth aftertaste of citris and maple.

On Tuesday I went to the [Philly Whiskey Fest](http://www.phillymag.com/whiskeyfest/spiritlist.html) with a ""Must Try All The Things!"" mentality. While I came up a bit short here is a list of everything I did try:

- **Angel's Envy** - Amazing. I also met and talked with Lincoln. He was great to talk to and so legitimately excited about his whiskey and whiskey in general. We drank some tequila together under his recommendation - I thought that was funny.

- **Ardbeg 10 year** - I'm glad I tried it but I preferred Laphroaig

- **Eagle Rare Single Barrel 17 Year** - I'm glad I tried this too because I have a bottle of the Eagle Rare 10. I was thinking of buying the ER 17 and now I'm not. When the 10 is gone I'm definitely buying ...

- **Basil Hayden** - GREAT STUFF. If you like Eagle Rare give this a go.

- **Glenfiddich 21 Year** - very good. I have the 15 year at home so I made it a point to try. Considering the price I don't think it is a buy for me but again

- **Laphroaig 18 Year** - The Laphroaig 10 is my favorite scotch so I wanted to try all of their offerings. The 18 year was fantastic

- **Laphroaig Quarter Cask** - I did not like this as much as the others

- **Laphroaig Triplewood** - Loved it. Such a distinct and original taste. It was like squeezing the 10 year out of a saturated piece of wood straight from the cask. I'll be buying this in the very near future.

- **Whistle Pig Straight Rye** - I saw this recommended by someone on reddit who went to the NY fest and decided to give it a go. I bought a bottle a day later and I should have bought 2.

- **Death's Door White Whiskey** - I was excited to try a white whiskey

- **Balvenie 12 Year Doublewood** - After having the Laphroaig triplewood I was excited to give this a go. I know they are from different regions but there were some similarities due to the shared process style. This was not my favorite - ok at best.

- **Balvenie 14Yr Old Caribbean Rum Cask** - I had originally intended to skip this one because I expected an overwhelming spiciness due to the rum cask but my friend at the show recommended it and I am SO glad he did. This was delicious.

- **Maker's 46** - Maker's seems to want a little more respect and are after in with the 46. I will now give them a little more respect. This was good. Not great but good.

- **Booker's** - this is the second time I've tried Booker's. Probably the last.

- **Compass Box Whisky Co: Peat Monster** - I really liked this scotch.The peat smell was overwhelming at first

- **Compass Box Whisky: Orangerie** - Tried this on a whim and I'm also glad I did. It was very smooth

- **Crown Royal Cask 16** - I wanted to try a Canadian and I'm glad it was this one. Really enjoyable

- **Samaroli (the entire line)** - This stuff was really complex


I think there were a few more whiskeys that I tried though these stood out the most. I also got to sample some great tequilas and rums. I will do everything in my power to make sure I go back next year! It was a fantastic event but my wonderful whiskey week did not end there...

I come from the coffee industry knowing very little about alcohol especially whiskey but one thing I learned through coffee is that there is a lot to appreciate about drinks of single origins as opposed to blends whether it's a single-estate coffee bean or a single malt whiskey. Trying to get into appreciating whiskey more but my experience and pallate are still quite limited. I have a few questions and hopefully I won't sound too naive:

1. How the heck do I pronounce Glenfiddich and Glenlivet?

2. I've been buying small bottles every now and then just to try something new. First I tried Alberta Premium Rye Whiskey and that was pretty neat in some cocktails then I tried Ballentine's Finest and I've been thoroughly disappointed. That being said

3. What is the most appropriate way to store whiskey after opening? I have a bottle of Glenlivet that is about half-full(empty) and was wondering if keeping it in the bottle at room temp is ideal.

So we would like to gift my father whiskey and would like to invest sth. about 150 €. I read around in this subreddit looking for good ones and this is my choice:

Redbreast 15y (http://www.whisky.de/shop/Irland/Redbreast-15J-2011--.html)
Jameson Gold (http://www.whisky.de/shop/Irland/Jameson-Gold--.html)
Glenlivet 18y (http://www.whisky.de/shop/Schottland/Glenlivet-18-Jahre--.html)


Now i'm asking myself are they a good choice? Do they taste different? Because we would like to give him different and new tastes

My mom tells me he has got a Laphroig 15y and a Bruich Laddich at home. Are these simlar to the three I chose? 

Just interested in your thoughts about the whole thing.

Thx a lot :)
