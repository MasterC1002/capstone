The problem was that he played with a unique racquet; 15% smaller than everyone else's, until I finally had the legendary Wilson Original in my hand. It was magnificent: matt black, with an uncompromising, manly frame. However out on court it was nothing like I imagined; it was akin to playing tennis with a squash racquet. Yet, convinced I would improve, I persisted with the monstrosity. 

As time went by, Pete being Pete, strung his racquet 20% higher than everyone else (even the pros), and all I could do was follow his path (silencing the nagging doubts in my mind). Predictably, it made my game tank further, not only was the racquet tiny but it now became like playing with a plank of wood. That combined with a growing fondness for beer did not bode well for my ambitions…

Because of my stubbornness I continued for years

I would eventually break the racquet in a moment of frustration, whenever I miss a shot, I don't swear, I just mutter under my breath: "" for Pete's sake"".

1. Official Draw threads for at the very least the grandslams

2. A more interesting layout. While I prefer the simpler reddit themes to the super complicated ones

3. Flair showing out favorite players or surfaces

4. Official threads for trainers or new players looking for tips. This already occurs but its so intermingled with new stories that I feel like a weekly official thread or maybe even its own affiliated subreddit would really help.

5. Contests for Tennis merch

It's been super frustrating to lose on unforced errors and double faults and I've come close to just giving up.

I've been working on my forehand a lot, worked on extending my arm, played for hours against a wall, watched tons of video, did a lot of shadow swinging while hanging out watching TV. I think the biggest difference has been learning how to load my weight on my outside leg and then transfer during the swing. Took forever to get that right.

Anyway, but I actually felt *good* afterward.

I've come really close to just giving up on playing in leagues and yesterday things just finally clicked. I've been lurking on this subreddit for a while

* CSS for hiding titles with scores/results (hiding = spoiler tag in /r/puzzles).
* CSS for highlighting the match threads (by changing the title color and/or putting an icon in front of the title). I think
* Update the sidebar to inlcude common info that people often ask in the subreddit. For example, links to schedule of the upcoming matches/tournaments. Links to tennis networking websites. Probably not all of these, but whatever the members need most.
* Personalized flairs. Define a set of flairs in the css
* We also have a pic on our cricket subreddit (in the sidebar) and we keep changing it based on the current events.

What do you think of these changes? Any other suggestions?

I'll be happy to assist the mods with any of these tasks.

I just finished my match

I won 6-0, is a much...much better player than I am (I recently got bumped up to 4.0).  In my region, the difference between 4.0 and 4.5 is great.

The match itself was also rather significant.  Due to my win, we were tied with the 3rd placed team on wins, so it came down to ""individual games won"" - where we won by 3.  If I had given up any more than 4 games, even if I won, our team would have been knocked out of playoffs.

***

**How I won:**

* As suggested

* I very rarely hit it to his forehand

* If he hit to my backhand, he was having serious trouble driving it back to my backhand.  He hit them out, or he hit them cross-court.

* When he did catch me with a big looping shot to my backhand that I wasn't able to step up into

* I was cheating my to backhand side

* When I got up 3-0 in the first game he started hitting balls in frustration after the point was over into the fence.  By the start of the second set he was yelling and throwing his racquet.  I never

As the men were undergoing the baseline revolution with Bjorn Borg and Jimmy Connors, her steady drumbeat groundstrokes, flat, precise, unwavering.

Like McEnroe was to Borg, the revolution came in three parts.  Lendl showed you could hit winners from the baseline with a powerful forehand and powerful serve.  Then, Becker and Agassi were his successors.  For the women's game, it was Steffi Graf, so called Fraulein Forehand, whose pace was unheard of until Monica Seles arrived and could hit hard on both sides.

In the midst of this power revolution, Jennifer Capriati.  These were tall women that clubbed the ball inspired by Steffi Graf.  Date was small, not terribly fast, but she did what she could to defy big babe tennis.

Date knew she lacked the strength of tall players, hit more like an extended half-volley, barely a backswing and barely a follow through.  She took the ball off the rise, lest the balls bounce too far up where her diminutive size would find it a challenge to reach.  She hit to the sidelines, to the baseline, taking risk after risk.

Where Chris Evert and even Graf and Seles were used to rallies that went 20 shots or more, she lost it right away, her games mimicking those of a serve and volleyer.

Then, Michael Krumm in 2001.  She entertained a brief comeback in 2002, but made her first serious attempt in 2008.  This was, apparently, no lark.  This wasn't Borg trying to play with a wood racquet years after he retired in 1982 and then gracefully retiring.  In 2013, Date is in her fifth year of her second career.

In the meanwhile, bigger topspin, and her flat style become even more of an oddity.

1995 was the year Carina Witthoft was born.  As Date-Krumm contemplated retirement

She had

In the blink of an eye

She managed to hold serve, and managed to win points before she lost them, a problem she's always having to deal with, lacking a topspin shot to give her safety.

The new Date-Krumm comes to net more often, moving her side to side, where age and speed work against her.  And while Date-Krumm's errant shots will likely get the best of her soon, for a round, just a single round, she can imagine what it was like to be at her peak, showing the young'uns that this old lady of tennis still knows a thing or two about winning.",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/tennis/comments/1h3wg4/kimiko_datekrumm_goes_old_school_in_her_42_minute/

1372996221.0,1ho882,The astute Ivan Lendl,dropshot,60,14,6,"I just heard an interview with Ivan Lendl on Tennis Channel.  He's generally pretty terse in his responses

He said he and Andy were hoping Verdasco would play a few bad games, and this caused Verdasco, who plays weaker defense than Nadal, to struggle and reach shots, many of which he missed.

Lendl was the original thoughtful planner, to getting his racquets to be weighed and strung the same.  He was the guy who switched racquets at every changeover, who played with racquets that Connors and McEnroe used to see what the racquets could do.  He invited juniors to play with him (including Sampras).  He had his courts in Connecticut surfaced just like the US Open.  He has Murray practicing at the same time the match has occurred.

Murray is similarly smart,False,self,t5_2qiq1,False,,yonex,t3_1ho882

* [Djokovic leads the head-to-head 8-5](http://www.atpworldtour.com/Players/Head-To-Head.aspx?pId=MC10&amp;oId=D643)

* This is their first meeting on grasscourt.

---

**6:23PM:** This is a difficult one for me to pick

* **FIRST SET**

**6:35PM:** Murray up 1-0

**6:38PM:** Djokovic saves break points in his opening service to tie it 1-1.

**6:49PM:** Murray holds with an extended rally

**6:54PM:** 3-3.

**7:04PM:** Murray 4-3

**7:10PM:** 4-4

**7:19PM:** Murray 6-5

**7:25PM:** A passing shot gives Andy Murray the first set at 30-40. **Murray 7-5**

* **SECOND SET**

**7:33PM:** The Serb screams out when unable to convert a break point at 30-40.

**7:36PM:** Murray 1-0

**7:38PM:** Andy gets first point by playing a weird volley dropshot as he's rolling across the ground and just hitting the line. Unreal

**7:49PM:** Murray 2-1

**8:00PM:** 3-3

**8:03PM:** Murray 4-3

**8:07PM:** 4-4.

**8:15PM:** A chance for Djokovic to get the break is met with an unreturnable serve

**8:18PM:** Insane rally at 0-15

**8:20PM:** 5-5

**8:27PM:** Murray 6-5. Every game is being contested

Very tense

**8:30PM:** Three match points for Andy Murray.

**8:31PM: Murray wins**

**8:41PM: 7-5 7-5** / That's easily one of the best matches I've seen Murray play. A month after Wimbledon

This loss for Djokovic means Roger's #1 ranking is safe for another two weeks. Novak goes on to play Del Potro for the Bronze Medal

**8:45PM:** Murray: ""It's more like a concert rather than a tennis match.""",self,t5_2qiq1,1344023132.0,,lacoste,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/tennis/comments/xmn44/match_thread_djokovic_vs_murray_mens_singles/

1370731578.0,1fy85g,What can David Ferrer do to win?,dropshot,49,7,19,"Everyone treats the final as a foregone conclusion: Rafa is going to win.  And there are certainly plenty of reasons to believe this.

Rafa has only ever lost to Ferrer on clay once and that was their first meeting back in 2004.  Even then, one could argue the Ferrer of today is far better than the Ferrer of 2004.

Everyone admires David Ferrer's work ethic, Berdych, del Potro.  Ferrer does quite well against big servers and big hitters.  Recall he was the guy that finally beat Jerzy Janowicz at Paris last year, and he also beat Milos Raonic when he has a good Australian Open run.

But against Nadal, Ferrer has struggled to win. Some of it, I think, is mental.  Ferrer is kind of in awe of these players, especially Nadal and Federer, and might play less than his best tennis.

The things that work against David Ferrer:

* **Lacks a big serve.**  Ferrer is a big serve away, Ferrer is working every point.  Nadal may not have a big serve either, but that spin seems to give people a lot of trouble, and so Nadal picks up a lot of free points anyway.
* **Lacks a putaway shot.**  Nadal is sometimes characterized as ""defensive"", when he's playing his best defense, makes incredible gets and passes.  Ferrer is quick, but Nadal does more when he gets to shots than Ferrer.  Again, the lack of a putaway shot means Ferrer has to work hard.
* **Doesn't ""go"" for it.**  Announcers are only more than happy to tell you that a player has nothing to lose, then why not do that all the time.  Usually, the result is a player playing something that's not their game, and losing quickly.

Many of these criticisms actually apply to Murray, but often was reluctant to do so.  Murray built up his serve over the years, and though he sometimes lacks consistency, he does get a few free points that Ferrer doesn't.  Murray, with his work with Lendl, has also been more aggressive off the ground, trying to end points sooner

In a way, and he can turn defense to offense and dictate with the forehand, that even though he doesn't go full Verdasco and try to attack all the time, he's quite effective anyway.  Against Djokovic, Nadal had to learn to let his aggressive side show more.  Ferrer seems to lack this aspect to his game, so he tends to grind more.

Having said all that, has at least taken a set off of him.  Think about all the times Federer played Rafa in the finals.  The best he ever did was take one set off of Rafa.  No one ever said ""well, Roger's in the finals, so Rafa will win another French Open"", even if that was rather true.  Fans just felt that his weapons, firing consistently (more than usual), would be enough to beat Rafa (even as Djokovic discovered

Everyone just feels that if Roger played insanely well, and feel that he'll just do the same things that's caused him to lose all this time, even if he may be making tactical adjustments.

Realistically, and alas, hopefully hurt.  He's already withdrawn from Halle.  Still, a hurt Nadal may simply just be more aggressive.  And there's no indication that Nadal is hurt any more than usual, that is, not enough to prevent a win.  Second, of course, and not making errors of his own.  With no sets dropped (admittedly

Djokovic had some success drop shotting Nadal

Still, perhaps more trouble than we expect a power player like Tsonga or Berdych to give.

I think that could be true for a lot of you as well. The problem is

So instead of having to search through all kinds of links in the different sports subs I subscribe to

 /r/athleticfeats

Basically I want to showcase the amazing things that humans are capable of. I'm looking for everything from monster dunks to free climbing. Anything that takes extreme physical talent above and beyond what you see normally watching sports. I would really like to incorporate tennis into this given the athleticism it takes to play.

So my concept is essentially:

When you find a video of an athlete doing something badass

Her opponent in the second round was Alexandra Cadantu of Romania

Unlike Witthoft, many rallies went 10 shots.  Cadantu hits an accurate ball and moves side to side, but somehow, Date-Krumm stayed close despite her penchant for unforced errors.

It didn't hurt that Cadantu doesn't have a huge serve or the biggest groundstrokes.  Date-Krumm tried to come to net when it made sense

Date-Krumm had more chances to break in the second having her down 15-40 before she made several errors and did not break.  Date-Krumm then broke for a 5-4 lead

The downside is she has to play Serena

Date-Krumm has played a Williams sister at Wimbledon before.  Back in 2011, 6-3, 8-6.  Of course, Venus (esp. in the last few years) is not her sister, so to expect such a close score would require a bit of help from Serena or for Date-Krumm to return exceptionally well. 

The oldest woman to win one round is Martina Navratilova, Shriver was past her prime).  She did say that her loss did open up opportunities to do television broadcasts (as sometimes early losers are invited to do commentary).",,False,self,t5_2qiq1,False,yonex,

It seems like Novak's brilliant return game and defense leads to long rallies and long matches and that brings out the very best of whoever he's playing.  I'm more of a Federer fan but i live watching Djokovic play in big Grand Slam matches because theyre usually exciting and go right down to the wire.  Hoping that tomorrow's Wimbledon Final vs.  Murray is another instant classic.

3rd set...**Nishikori consolidates. 5-0. As casonthemason mentions

*Update 3*:

**Nishikori takes the win in on home turf! 7-6 3-6 6-0.** I believe this is the first time a Japanese player has won this Open in 40 years? Incredible. He picked up his footwork, and mental attitude and played flawlessly in the 3rd set. Well deserved. Raonic's loss was compounded by how many unforced errors were happening, but Nishikori was really starting to work him side-to-side in the end.

1375062420.0,1j8zd9,US Prospect Roundup,YaoPau,33,7,14,"A bunch has happened since the last one.  Taking it prospect by prospect...

**Ryan Harrison** has dropped to 130th in the world!  He's 11-21 on the ATP tour in his last 52 weeks, hitting everything into the middle of the court with okay pace and poor depth.  It's really disappointing for someone who was a top-50 player just after his 20th birthday.  Speaking of Ryan...

A few days ago, then was 2 points from the match up 5-4 in the 3rd before losing 5-7.  On the surface, that's a damn good showing for a just-turned 19 year old who was playing in an ATP 2nd round for the first time.  

But it's the same game Ryan Harrison had at 19 and mostly has now.  Christian has a prettier backhand, without great depth.  And like Ryan, Christian has been really aggressive with moving up through the ranks.  Despite starting the year on the Futures tour and doing nothing of note at the Challenger level, Christian has entered 5 ATP tournaments as wild cards this year.  The Isner loss was nice, as was his win over world #83 Alejandro Falla the round before that.  But today Christian played against a veteran baseliner at the Challenger level, Somdev Devvarman, and Christian lost 0-6

**Brad Klahn** won the 2010 NCAA singles title, but he's mentally very strong and keeps the ball in play.  But he's broken through with three strong performances this month: Finalist at the Winnetka Challenger, Finalist at the Binghampton Challenger, SemiFinalist at the Lexington Challenger, and he'll break into the Top 150 when the new rankings come out tomorrow.  I think he ends up as one of these guys who maxes out around the Top 100, but a year ago that would've been a major stretch.

**Noah Rubin** makes an appearance on the weekly roundup!  John McEnroe's golden goose, and he will share headlines for the next group of prospects with...

**Stefan Kozlov**, but here is a post about [him](http://www.reddit.com/r/tennis/comments/1f8r7m/this_is_what_a_superprospect_looks_like_stefan/), one on [his Newport match](http://www.reddit.com/r/tennis/comments/1hwgys/stefan_kozlov_played_his_first_atplevel_match/), and a [link](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8z6IWZdVNE) to watch the full match.  Cliff notes: Kozlov had the match won, but started cramping up badly and lost the last three games :(

**Alex Kuznetsov** continued his career year with another Challenger title last week at Binghampton, Brad Klahn, and Christian Harrison along the way.  He's now up to #136 in the world after being #271 in mid-April, meaning he's almost guaranteed to crack the top-100 before his points start falling off.  There was a time when Kuznetsov was supposed to be the next great American after Andy Roddick... he'll never be that but he has plenty of time to still have a fine career.

Finally, Roddick was an absolute freak who made 68%+ of his first serves (somehow, despite being 6'1"" and hitting it that hard),while Sock's % is below-average at 55%, and unless that improves *dramatically*, the also-listed-at-6'1"" Sock didn't have enough else to his game to become an elite player.  

Well Sock was at Atlanta this week, maybe 6'4"".  He moves pretty well for a guy that size, and that height will give him a margin of error to improve that 1st serve % even with the complex motion.  Going from Nadal's height to almost Raonic's height makes him pretty intriguing going forward, there's no reason why he can't get inside the top 20 within the next couple years.",,False,self,1375062679.0,t3_1j8zd9

We got to the tennis center early cause we thought there would be traffic (which we beat by 2 hours)

The men's finals began at 12:30 with [Andy Murray](http://i.imgur.com/HVRt0.jpg) against [Novak Djokovic](http://i.imgur.com/CVmRp.jpg). Murray started the match off serving very well (hitting the 130's multiple times) and overall playing a good (but not great) game. Novak seemed a little tired or disinterested, but after being down 3-0 in the second the umpire announced Novak would retire due to his shoulder injury. People were pissed (I would have been too if I had driven out for that one match just to see it over so quickly), and you could tell Andy didn't want to win that way.

Good thing Novak announced he was retiring when he did

Once the court was dry they brought Andy and Novak back for the award ceremony

Women's was supposed to start at 4 but it started raining at 3:50 which means we had to wait til around 4:30 for the match to start. [Jelena Jankovic](http://i.imgur.com/hQOLG.jpg) took on [Maria Sharapova](http://i.imgur.com/HST65.jpg) (who screeched from the moment the match starts, and her accuracy was pretty good in the first set. Jelena came back from being down in the first set to win it 6-4. 

I went over to grandstand to watch the men's doubles teams take court [Llodra and Zimonjic](http://i.imgur.com/IVXTH.jpg) vs [Bhupathi and Paes](http://i.imgur.com/9lq4S.jpg). I didn't stay long cause I thought the women's finals was going to be over in the second set, 7-6) 

I went over to center court for the end of the second set. It was a close one

Sharapova really stepped up her game in the 3rd set (and equally the number of her ""come on!!"" 's doubled)

here's a pic of [Jelena](http://i.imgur.com/4Bj6X.jpg) going to get her trophy

Then [Maria](http://i.imgur.com/W5D7k.jpg) went to accept her trophy, and she's made it to the finals both years.

Here is a pic of the two finalists [smiling pretty with their trophies](http://i.imgur.com/kgReP.jpg) (sorry it's grainy I took a pic of the screen.)

Overall I'd say it was a very interesting tourney. A few great matches, It could not come any sooner.

My dad (also a tennis player) used to watch my high school matches and it made me really nervous. Sometimes I would lose to girls that I shouldn't have by making a lot of errors and just not developing a strategy enough to beat them. He then decided that he would ""pretend"" to be that person when we were practicing the next time and we would play a set against each other. He would exaggerate her main weaknesses based on what he saw the day I lost. He was very funny doing it because he would make these girly grunting sounds and pretend to get upset when I won the point. 

This exercise forced me to focus beyond the silliness, I heard my dad pretending to grunt like a girl, laughed, shrugged everything off, and played each point based on the strategy he helped me come up with. 

I recommend this to anyone who is struggling with the mental and decision making aspects of tennis or has trouble against certain types of players. A good coach will help you do this!

**Djokovic vs Chardy** Djokovic ownsa 6-0 record over Chardy

**Lopez vs Haas** To me, but Lopez is a solid grass court player.  Haas reached the semis of Halle, but Lopez won Eastbourne (with an admittedly weaker field).  Lopez complained about an injury at Eastbourne, but apparently, it wasn't enough to prevent him from winning.  Haas is favored and I'd lean that way, but I wouldn't be surprised if Lopez managed an upset.

**Gasquet vs Tomic** These two have only met twice, then fading in the second set.  It's difficult to predict this because it's clear Tomic is capable of more.  If he's going to start showing his talent, he'll need to beat a player of Gasquet's caliber, and he seems capable of it.  Gasquet is no slouch on grass.  He once reached the semis of Wimbledon (back in 2007).  Slight edge to Gasquet, but would like to see Tomic pull the upset.

**Anderson vs. Berdych** Berdych is flying under the radar.  He's had a pretty good 2013 despite not winning a title.  Both guys are tall and powerful, and 4 times this year (so far).  Berdych has won all 8 encounters.  You think Anderson ought to break through at some point, but certainly Berdych is going to have confidence having beaten Anderson so many times.  Edge to Berdych.

**Ferrer vs Dolgopolov** This is one of those weird matchups where you think a player like Dolgopolov should have a shot to win.  Dolgopolov is a bit like Baghdatis in that you think he has all the weapons to do well, as with most players he's played against, has a winning record, 5-1.  They've met most often on hard courts and Dolgo has pushed him a few times. Ferrer entered Wimbledon with an early round loss at s'Hertogenbosh, a Wimbledon tuneup (losing to Malisse), and he's been pushed to 4 sets.  I think Dolgo should push him, but Ferrer's competitive spirit should get him through.

**Sijsling vs Dodig** Kind of a tossup.  Both are unseeded.  They've never played each other.  Dodig has the higher rank.  Both beat a seed (Dodig over Kohlschreiber

**Nishikori vs. Seppi** Seppi kinda got lucky.  He went 5 sets over Istomin taking 2 sets in tiebreaks and was up 2 sets to love before winning in 5.  Then Llodra retired on him (but played doubles later that day).  Meanwhile Nishikori has two straight set wins.  Seppi plays a steady style while Nishikori gambles by pushing opponents side to side.  They've met once before with Nishikori winning.  Nishikori should be favored if he's playing his game well.

**del Potro vs Zemlja** The three big seeds that are flying under the radar are Ferrer, but he skipped the French.  However, Ferrer's quarter was considered pretty weak, and del Potro's section (in the same quarter) even weaker.  del Potro beat Zemlja in their only head to head in 2012, and should be favored, especially since Zemlja just came off a five set win (though he played like 2-3 games today, so hardlyb broke a sweat).  

**Kubot vs. Paire** Paire is a talented Frenchman, but Kubot should be competitive.

**Gulbis vs. Verdasco** This is a tough one to call.  Gulbis is the talented player that never fulfilled his talent, albeit on clay.  I guess I'll lean Gulbis, only because he *seems* to have dealt with his mental issues (both have them).  Could be a really nice power match.

**Monaco vs de Schepper** This a weird matchup.  Monaco is a clay courter who struggled in the South American swing, but lost in 5 in the opening round of the French Open.  But he had a really easy draw with qualifier Knittel and then Rajeev Ram of the US who was probably happy to win a round.  de Schepper is a tall Frenchman (like Kevin Anderson tall) who should have the power to be an interesting player, but has never had a nice signature win.  He reached the third round when Cilic pulled out and beat clay courter Paolo Lorenzi in the opening round.  Another one I don't care and could go either way.  I pick Monaco mostly because of pedigree (i.e., better ranking).  Obviously nice draw for both, with both a bit lucky to reach this point.

**Troicki vs Youzhny** This is also a tough one to call.  Normally, is known for playing well when he plays well.  He reached the finals of Halle this year, so he can play grass.  He holds a 3-2 record over Troicki, but Troicki won their last two meetings.  Troicki has been playing on and off tennis for the last two years averaging about one match win per tournament.  However, he does seem to peak at Slams.  His best showing this year has been at the French Open where he reached the fourth round.  Last year, one of his better showings was a fourth round appearance at Wimbledon.  Although Youzhny reached the finals of Halle, he struggled to beat Pospisil in 5 sets with Pospisil up a break in the fifth set before he choked it at the end.  I'm going to lean to Troicki for the upset.

**A look back to Stakhovsky vs Melzer**

Today Stakhovsky lost to Melzer which he claimed was due to playing Melzer incorrectly.  He tried to play Melzer like he did Roger Federer and that didn't work.  One reason,False,self,t5_2qiq1,False,,yonex,t3_1halr6
