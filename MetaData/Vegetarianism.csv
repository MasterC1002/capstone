Though 'Lyfe' (a healthy fast food restaurant, there is still an open market for a healthy/wholesome vegetarian eatery in the food chain business. (I imagine a place of the same stature as Panera/Applebee's, but will be committed to healthy/wholesome vegetarian food, even if the prices have to be a bit more expensive than traditional restaurant prices). Imagine a Whole Foods dining experience, but with more of a theme/vibe, perhaps. Also, it wouldn't have to be advertised as a ""vegetarian place"", but still resistant to a healthy vegetarian lifestyle.

Then in March I will send them all (highlighted and noted) along with a letter to the Guinness asking them to consider creating a vegetarian option of some sort.

I then got married to a great guy who is from a rural farming area

I want to cut meat out of my diet again for moral reasons. Getting my husband to go along with meatless cooking isnt really a difficult battle, but these people are with me for the rest of my life, and I don't want to offend their livelihood (they don't really even know how much I disagree with factory farming to begin with). Then when we have kids, if they're mostly vegetarian, I can't imagine the comments we'll get. Add this to being politically liberal and atheist in a conservative Christian environment.... this is the cherry on the cake. 

I also feel like an enormous hypocrite because we accepted their financial assistance here and there during college- that money came directly from something that I really disagree with

Does anybody have any advice? Tips? Experience?  Can anybody help me think of ways to make it less awkward to go visit them if I go back to vegetarianism? I think I'd still eat fish occasionally, etc.

When she came over I would cook the artificial meat and eat it with her

So I started looking at websites like allrecipes/vegetarian and began to discover some of the most delicious and (sometimes)healthy food I had ever had. My roommate and I love to eat pork, lamb, duck, turkey, you name it. But when my girlfriend comes over and I cook those vegetarian recipes for all of us, it just so happens that I don't miss the meat at all. 

Of course my roommate complains as I'm cooking: 

Him: Could you add some meat?
Me: No.
Him: How about make mine separately and add meat to it?
Me: No.
Him: I hate you
Me: No.

Afterwards he always says: damn dude that was tasty

Ha. I think the biggest mental block I had about eating vegetarian is picturing a life of munching on salad, which i hate even more, all the time.  

I'm not a convert by any means

None of the recipes are complicated at all with weird gluten ingredients or shit like that

Here in order are the 3 absolute most delicious ones I have had and if you do attempt to make it off [allrecipes vegetarian section](http://allrecipes.com//Recipes/everyday-cooking/vegetarian/Main.aspx) read the upvoted comments for great tips.

The reddit accounts usually look like they were created by smashing your face on the keyboard (e.g. ""lpsodfs"" ""xbviuer"" ""likefw"") and will only have one submission. If you are unsure whether an account is part of the spam ring, it's safe to say it is spam.

While I'm usually pretty good about looking at the new submissions of the subreddits I mod, to please report it. If you don't know how, you can do so by clicking the ""report"" link under the submission so it gets sent to my modque. If it is indeed a spam account, I'll deal with it. If it's just someone innocently sharing a post from Tumblr, then I'll just mark the post as being fine. 

You can also report the user as a spammer. If you use RES, then go to [/r/reportthespammers](/r/reportthespammers) and submit the link.

I tried Vegusto's products this week and I am amazed at how good they are. They're a little expensive compared to the real thing but they're fantastic and I'm happy to pay the prices. They are wheat based and the flavours are very close to the originals.

I got a bronze starter pack thing which contains 1 normal cheese, 2 burgers and 2 packs of sliced meats. I've now tried it all and can report back on it.

The basic cheese is fantastic. I can't tell the difference between it and normal cheddar cheese except it doesn't coat your mouth the same way


The melting cheese is very similar but has a slightly looser texture. It tastes the same but struggles when you melt it. Normal cheese's flavour changes slightly to go a bit milder when used

The Sausages are great. They have the texture of a hotdog sauce and feel meaty to bite into. The flavour is some where between a hot dog sausage and pepperoni. Its not my prefered meaty flavour but it satisfies that meaty craving you have and would be great in oven bakes. The very mild spiciness to them would be fantastic in a pasta sauce or similarly styled bake. In fact while writing this I now regret eating them all as I want it for dinner tonight.

The burgers are the worst of what I've tried. They're not bad, but it isn't a burger, and these lean very much towards a fruit pudding texture and a slight hint of that flavour. They're not bad and I'd happily munch on one at a barbeque or whatever, but you couldn't trick any one with one of these and the real thing. Worth a try but I wouldn't buy more of them.

The slices of meat are awesome. They send you two different flavours in the starter pack and they look disgusting in the wrapping. They look half melted and just.. I'll pass. But the taste of them is really good. They're close to a luncheon meat in texture and not too far off in flavour.  One is slightly spicey (not hot


Overall I found Vegusto stuff to be fantastic and something I will be adding as a staple to my diet. I've already ordered some more stuff from them before I've polished off what I have here. If you're in the UK or have a way to get it to you,,False,self,t5_2qhzr,False,,True

My name is Downvotedandy

My want to switch to a vegetarian diet has been a slow creeping process. I want to preface this by saying that I loved meat, eggs etc.

My journey to becoming a vegetarian:

I have  been having horrible experiences with animal proteins lately. 

Here are some examples:

* made sunny side up eggs, or something in mind clicked when I looked at the yellow yolks. I have had eggs again but only the whites in an omelette.

* never was a big fan of milk or diary products, ice cream to the point that I don't want it, because it makes me sick. I can though enjoy yogurt, hard cheeses.

* I bought a chicken to roast, I on the other hand cannot stomach the thought after the incident.

* Bought minced/ground pork, and sometime their pork smells slightly different from what you buy a at a mainstream grocery store, but I've never had a problem before.

**So here's the TL;DR**

A series of unfortunate events regarding meat and diary products have me nauseous at the thought of any meat

And here's the actual question:

What do I eat? How much? I don't want to give up pasta or bread. I don't eat copious amounts but I like some pasta or a piece of bread with salad sometimes.

Here's a sample of what I'll eat:

* watermelon 1/2 cup

* full fat yogurt 1/2 cup

* potato and leek soup ( homemade

* sautéed red cabbage

* homemade roasted red pepper

( homemade yeast crust

* endamame 1/2 cup

* peanut butter 1 tbsp

So is this a normal type menu? Am I missing something. Should I add more of something? I also have an irrational fear of gaining weight because ill be eating probably more carbs and fat than usual.

So far it's been going well! I'm on my second week. I've been eating seafood though. I've noticed I have to get more creative with my meals

Do you discriminate between the pain of a small crustacean and a large mammal?

If you were dying from hunger would you consider eating an animal? 
Is is true you won't get your vitamins/nutrients without meat?

What led you to vegetarianism? 
Do you enjoy the taste of meat but hate the idea of it being dead flesh?
How do you justify ancient civilizations that hunted for meat?
Any bad experiences with your transition to vegetarianism?
Ever feel like you're limited when it comes to international food?
Ever feel like you're offending a well-meaning native when you refuse to eat a dish offered by someone in a foreign country? Do you feel limited or perhaps pretentious? Is being vegan more difficult than being vegetarian?  Aren't you still condoning animal cruelty when you consume milk and eggs? How is eating meat bad for the environment?

1280728373.0,cwayq,Easy ways to be vegetarian,big_red__man,19,4,12,"There seems to be a bunch of people that want to know how to switch to being veg

Qualifications:  I have been a vegetarian for about 13 years now.  I started out as a vegan but after a couple of years I started eating dairy again.

Sandwiches.  Just don't put the meat on.  Lettuce, mustard, and mayo is my default sandwich.  I like to add sprouts because then I can drizzle oil on it (the sprout matrix holds the oil in) and grind some pepper and sprinkle some salt.  Also, pickle alternatives like dilled cauliflower and roasted red peppers add some punch.  Crusty bread ties it all together.  Get take-out menus from local sandwich shops and try to re-create the veg sandwiches.

Pizza.  Buy a frozen cheese pizza and put some chopped up veggies (or whatever) and some more cheese on it.  Remember two things: adding an extra layer of veggies (or whatever) and cheese means it's going to need to cook a little longer.  Also, maybe use paper towels.  The little pools of liquid keep that section of pizza from cooking as fast as the rest of it.

Baked potatoes.  Scrub 'em, chopped broccoli, shredded cheddar and put it back in the mic for another min or so.  Then add sour cream, salsa, ranch, or whatever.  Actually baking the potatoes is way better but it takes at least 45 minutes.

Tacos.  Tacos are the same except you use the veggie ground “meat” instead.  However, turn the faucet on full blast and immediately shut it off.  Stir it in over the heat.  Add more as necessary.  The “meat” doesn’t need to cook, so it’s ready when you think it’s hot enough.  Also, the veg “meat” comes in 12 oz packages and the spice packet call for 1lb.  I sauté onions and peppers before adding it to make up for the difference.  Maybe use black beans and rice instead of the veg “meat”.  Lime, cilantro, mmm….

Pasta.  Noodles and sauce is where you start.  I augment store bought sauce by sautéing onions, etc first then adding the sauce and some herbs.  Simmer that for about 10-ish under low heat.  Top the cooked noodles with this augmented sauce and sprinkle some Italian shredded cheese blend or parmesan. 

tl;dr  It’s just easy ways for people to think about vegetarian meals when they are used to meat being the center of a meal.  Not supposed to be a “well-rounded diet”.

I work generally eight hours a day and that means having to figure out what food to bring to work. I am not so good at this and in the first week of my attempt at a meatless diet I've lost 7lb (if I don't have anything to bring I usually just walk to Smart and Final on my lunch and buy fruits and nuts

Basically I need to figure out some decent meals that will help me put on some weight and keep me healthy. That's where your suggestions come in. I've been trying to search around all these subreddits/online services/blogs/recipe sites, I completely understand and I apologize for wasting your time. If anything hopefully this thread can become a good resource for others like me.


Some info about me:

Gender: Male

Height: 6'1/2""

Weight: 132lb (dropped from a steady 139lb)

Today I didn't have work and I think I did pretty decent with what was available in my home:

Breakfast: 1 cup of steal cut oats cooked in low fat milk / 1 orange

Lunch: 1 can of organic Trader Joe's brand potato vegetable soup / 2 slices of whole grain wheat bread with two large eggs (eggs in a nest)

Snack: 1 cliff bar

Dinner: A large mixed green salad with balsamic vinegar / 1 apple / 1 pear

Is it wrong to kill animals because they feel pain? What about animals that cannot feel pain, the fact that plants cannot feel pain does not justify eating them.

Is it wrong to kill animals because they have brains and are, can we eat them? Can we eat jellyfish? My guess is that the answer is still no; that even though these animals are not meaningfully conscious, it is still wrong to kill them.

So if pain is not a moral criteria

PS - I am not trollin'

EDIT Essentially what I'm saying is that the moral issue of meat comes down to consciousness/sentience, like sea anemones are not sentient.  If you say that they should still not be killed even though they are not aware, what is your justification for saying so?  Is it simply because they are living things?  Are plants not living things?  If you instead say that they are okay to eat because they are not meaningfully sentient, then you have admitted that sentience is a criteria for moral worth.  However, we know that some animals are more sentient than others, so those animals which are the most sentient would be due the most moral consideration.  The question therefore becomes: how do we objectively determine which level of sentience is meaningful and which isn't?",,self,,
