Edit 02: Descriptions added.

Edit 03: Ok, [uTorrent](http://utorrent.com/), [DropBox](http://dropbox.com/), etc.), and some things I have left out because they have very specialised uses that only certain people require (ie. [Coda](http://panic.com/coda/), [Transmit](http://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CCIQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fpanic.com%2Ftransmit%2F&amp;ei=2A6MUIyPLpGqrAelmYDACw&amp;usg=AFQjCNGVE0Hy-HUbateLIVvcexT1PNaNdQ&amp;sig2=rm-K64AoIsQjH8sY-JEA7A), [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com), etc.).

Also

I will add more as I test them

Edit 04: May I suggest a quick Command+F before suggesting anymore Apps/Utilities as we are now getting a lot of duplicates.

One of the employees greets me and I tell her the situation. I apologize because the problem sounds so petty. But I can't give a damaged gift to someone. She says she completely understands ""Let me go talk to my manager."". I'm sitting there expecting the worst when she returns and says ""We're going to replace it for you free of charge."". I was dumbfounded and extremely relieved at the same time. It was my screw up and they totally bailed me out.

People can complain about Apple all day long about the price of their products and that it's all fad but I say this. I don't know any other company with the kind of customer service they have and I truly appreciate the employees and what they do.

1333610292.0,rubzn,How my Apple hate quite literally burned me,takosgowa,1327,466,452,"Sooo... I’m  a fucking idiot. This is the medium length story as to why

Maybe saying that I hate Apple is going a bit far, I hate the lining up for new devices and I really didn’t appreciate the canonisation of Steve Jobs.

OSX isn’t for me and iOS isn’t my favourite mobile OS, Apple products are seemingly the only ones to get all of the intangibles right. After hemming and hawing for months, in my search for a thin-and-light laptop I settled on a Macbook Air. It didn’t particularly feel great buying an Apple product, but it was the best machine out at the time for me. 

I ran Windows through boot camp as my primary OS and it ran incredibly well. 6 and a half hours battery life, and (my favourite part about the Macbook Air), it was dead silent. I *fucking hate* fan noise, and the Macbook Air kept the system cool with the faintest puff of air if I put my ear to the exhaust port. 

But still, web browsing for hours, flawless document and image creation, movie editing, all of this without sounding like a jet taking off – I was still uncomfortable with the fact that I’d “bought in” and drank that particular Kool Aid. 

So, let me emphasise, I am stupid. I thought I’d pick up a Macbook Air competitor for less money and stop feeling like a dick for having an Apple computer. This is the first key mistake.

The second mistake was the fact that you can’t actually buy a comparable setup to the Macbook Air without paying hundreds of dollars more. I bought the Samsung Series 9 900X3A-B06US, supposedly a lot of things. I sold my Macbook Air, got the Series 9 and was happy with it for about ten minutes. Until the system heated up for the first time, the fan kicked in and I was treated to the sound of a thousand mosquitos fucking each other after being up all night on methamphetimes. 

It just wouldn’t shut the fuck up. I work in a quiet office, the battery life was 2 hours shorter (on a machine that natively runs Windows), the SSD had a quarter of the space taken up by a useless recovery partition that requires the installation of three programs and 5 hours to remove, the screen is muddy due to a lower resolution and a matte screen that lacks clarity, it picks up fingerprints like my brother picks up ladyboys in Thailand, and it sounds like thousands of mosquitos fucking each other after being up all night on cocaine (I changed it up to keep you interested). 

I called Samsung and asked if there was anything I could do about the aforementioned fan noise. They directed me to a system option named “Silent Mode”

What they didn’t tell me was that part of the system’s cooling mechanism involves disappating heat through the bottom panel of the laptop, meant pain. 

After a few hours of word processing in “Silent Mode”, and for the next few days it felt like bad sunburn. I’d checked the CPU temperature and it never got past 52C, but I started reading around – as one review put it, “""the underside sees temperatures that are best reserved for hot asphalt rather than a notebook. We can’t put this more delicately: when its processor is pushed, the Series 9 can become a dangerously hot nut roaster. "" 

I don’t know how hot it got 

So I called Samsung and said, and it burned my fucking legs. “Ah,” they said. “There’s your problem. You’re not supposed to use your notebook on your legs.” I know that the manuals of all notebooks say that, but I’ve never encountered one hot enough to make that warning a threat. I used to perch my Macbook Air on top of me for up to eight hours on days off, watching HD video, and the only effect would be slight warmth from the heatsink in the top left. 

**The Lesson, quite seriously, the best computer I’ve ever used. Maybe it’ll be eclipsed, maybe we’ll end up in a post-PC world, but for now there’s nothing that does what it does as effortlessly and (quite literally) painlessly. 

Apple haven’t just crammed in hardware without giving a fuck, hotter, louder, but it’s more than that. It’s about the intangible things – Apple’s begun to make computers so good you needn’t worry about anything other than the task at hand. 

Maybe some of the millions of people who profess to love Apple products do so because they’re slavishly devoted to savvy marketing and a trendy brand image. Maybe the people commenting on Engadget about how shit everything else is actually exist. But I’ve learned through painful experience that the reason most people love Apple is because they make rock solid products that don’t burn your motherfucking legs.

Instead

Fast forward two weeks. The repair is going horribly. They not only couldn't get the issue fixed

Fast forward one more week, not the original product.

My mom's 24"" iMac goes out 2 months after warranty and they give her a 27"" for free. The new machine is bigger in every respect: screen size, processor speed.

Just thought I'd share.

1. Didn't find it. Me and the gf looked for hrs. Filed local PD report with serial number. Filed serial number with Apple. Planning on returning Sunday with uncles metal detector and flyers. 

2. Boss was like 'the universe happens man

All is good. 

3. I'm updating this while standing in an alley in uptown outside my new apt

Original post ----

This sucks.

I'm two weeks into my first real career-type job. A Digital Media Specialist. I get to take photos and shoot video all day long. It's what I always wanted. After working in cubicles for 17 years...

The company bought me A/V equipment off a list I made myself. My dream gear. 

Included is a MacBook Pro w/ Retina, the works. I shot all day today. 100 miles away from homebase in the country. It was a long day, far from home.

My last task was to take the company car home

I didn't like the idea of opening the trunk in the mall parking lot  (with my rig and all my equipment for all to see). So I took the laptop out of my rig backpack and set it on the front seat next to me - so when I got to the mall I could hop out

It's a big weekend you see. I just moved from out-of-state to take this job and I move into my uptown apartment tomorrow!

Only I didn't put the laptop on the seat next to me; I set it on the roof of the car

Somewhere on that gravelly road / ditch next to the road my Mac flew off. It was in a case. Trela

I realized my mistake 20 miles later and flew back to search, and no clue how to get home (I'm in a new State remember?). Couldn't find anything. 

Headed back at sunrise. Boss comes in at 9:30am. I figure one of 3 things will happen. 

1. Ill find the laptop unharmed in a pile of cow dung = best case scenario
2. Someone has already found the laptop and will open it to see my frantic email
3. I or someone will find the laptop totally smashed and inoperable. 

I think I'm getting fired tomorrow unless maybe my boss will buy a new MacBook and take it,,False,,t5_2qh1f,1375464023.0,,True

Completely destroyed it. Was kinda pissed! Especially considering it was a month old...

So, and the majority of the components now resided within the box. A mate egged me on, three months later, to take it to apple to see if they could do anything.

Thus

Wasn't exactly holding out for much. Took it to them and didn't B.S. them - told them exactly what I did, as I'd completely buggered up the machine, it wasn't even complete and they didn't keep the components in the shop to fix it with. Basically, I was completely out of luck.

The guy just couldn't believe that I had the thing a month. Trying his hardest to help

I just basically gave up. Apathy was the adopted policy, well Apple in general. He told me that he'd have to get the documentation to declare that I had given them the iMac.

**Totalfinder** - tabbed Finder.


**Unarchiver** - obvious for rar files

**BetterTouchTool** - Saner touch controls for Lion (alternative: Jitouch

**MplayerX** - VLC alternative.

**Xslimmer** - Strips out unnecessary languages and binaries (powerpc binaries etc) from apps and OS. I would argue the need for this has receded

**Launchbar

**Moom, but everyone to their own.

**Trick:** If you want to have a modern filesystem without having to use NTFS trick

**Trick:** Dragging the small folder icon at the top of the Finder window while pressing Command + Option makes a shortcut of that folder in the location you drop the icon.

When Apple announced the release of the new Retina MacBook Pro

I open my front door to see that wonderful slim rectangular box leaned up against my door

Now if you have ever opened an Apple product, there was a pinky sized dent in the aluminum case.  

Now let me back up here, eeeehhh I doubt I qualify.  I have seen some pretty crazy PC case damage that when I contacted the manufacturer they would make me jump leaps and bounds to get it fixed/replaced and for the most part they would leave me without a new computer for the weeks/months it would take for them to write a wrong.  

So here I was, awesome!  

Well to make this story even sweeter, when the video card goes apeshit crazy!

I call up Applecare and they take note and setup an appointment for me with the genius bar at my local Apple store.  I head into the Apple store and although my mac stopped showing the video issue, transfers my data (only took 10 minutes for 300 gigs btw, holly crap!) and hands me ANOTHER brand new machine!  

So in the end, jump through countless hoops, I just called them up and within minutes they had a new machine on it's way to my hands.  Phenomenal customer service and even though they didn't need to, they gained a customer for life, again.

Further, I have since learned that the authors are using GPL'd code while demanding a ""donation"" and yet not offering source per the GPL licensing requirements. 

Here are some details on the process: 

- Go to the Mac The Ripper forum and email the developer asking for instructions on how to obtain the program. 

- He emails you a paypal address to ""donate"" $40. 

- After receiving the paypal confirmation email

- When launching the binary it will then automatically launch mail.app and email an activation code back to the developers. The instructions say that after this point they will email back a license key to launch the app. 

I ran into a problem whereby the developer wasn't convinced that I had paid, the flamewar only got worse. I wound up giving the asshole $40 and getting basically nothing in return. 

There are many commercial DVD rippers on the market now. They run like normal businesses. I could list a few

On the final day of possibly the greatest weekend on record, a friend and I said our long goodbyes and headed down to our rental vehicle and noticed the passenger window had been smashed and my messenger bag was gone....fuck.

Contents of bag included:

* Passport
* Car
* iPad
* Jambox
* Various important papers


Enter Batman mode.

Open Find My iPhone app and cross fingers this idiot doesn't know about it's traceable nature.

Remote lock: activated. 

Thank god....i located my iPad on the move in a hotel across the street.  I head the the courtyard in the radius of the signal; looking around trying to identify my bag on the dozens of people surrounding me.

I've dreamt about using this feature if someone ever stole my gear

They arrive quickly as I'm constantly refreshing the location.  I show him my app and brief him on the situation.  It seems to be moving through one of the hotels but I can't pinpoint it exactly. With no real accurate location we start lapping the area

It's not really moving. Seems to be in a hotel. The cop explains that we can't be going around knocking on all the rooms...I agree and after a few laps and 30 minutes

I send a message to my iPad: ""Fuck you""

When you send a message through the app

I head back to the parkade and show the officer the scene of the theft. He takes some pics and I answer some questions and my girlfriend starts the process of rescheduling our flight. My dream of using this app to catch a bad guy seems to be fading and I prepare myself to replace all the items that were stolen...not the end of the world but a raging pain.

The RCMP leave me a card with a file number and explain that if I find this guy

Soon after they leave and we start the process of patching up the window with cardboard and garbage bags as its pouring rain. I take one last look at my iPads location and shit...it's on the move and the location seems accurate. 

Never give up!  Never surrendaaaaar. 

I run towards its location. It's moving down the pedestrian main street in Whistler called ""Village Stroll"". As I'm moving I'm sending him messages and playing the annoying sound:

&gt;If you try and use this iPad

&gt;Drop the bag. Keep the iPad. I just want my fucking keys

The movement stops in a square and there's not many people around. I play the sound remotely without sending a message this time and seconds after I send...I hear it!

A somewhat normal looking dude walks past me in the opposite direction. As the sound goes off

In what seemed like an eternity

Finally

The thief sees this and ducks into a coffee shop...

I'm told to stay put and the two officers head in the shop and grab the guy

I stay away from the scene and listen to them talk. The guy explains he found the bag and was trying to find the owner...pfffff. Eventually he admits his guilt and in exchange for me not charging him

We head back to the initial radius I had tracked him to earlier and into a public washroom. Apparently he ditched it in the garbage.  My new found RCMP friend throws on some gloves and roots through the garbage...DING DING DING!  My bag was there but my travel wallet was not. Another radio conversation happens and we head to a different hotel public washroom to find my travel wallet buried amongst the filth.

""It *NEVER* works out like this"" the RCMP explain to me.

I express a huge amount of gratitude for the help and I get some in return for locating the bad guy. It was a fun little game.

**TL;DR** Bad guy smashes window and takes my bag containing my iPad. Use Find My iPhone to track him down and coordinate his arrest and get all my stuff back...I am batman.

Backstory. I was an Evo 4G user

I switched because I have a Mac Mini

- holy Christmas the *KEYBOARD on the 4S is amazing. I've used about five different android keyboards (stock HTC, swiftkey X, and swype) and never had one even close to this good

- *SMOOTH as silk speed throughout

- my iPhone is on AT&amp;amp;T and I am frequently pulling down 4mbs in downtown Boston. Compared to sprint 3G CDMA that's at least four times faster. Versus 4G, my Evo could not get more than 6 hours of battery life  regardless of use. This is due to how poor the WiMAX radio functions in the phone. *It made using 4G a rare moment as I rarely had it on*

- love how uniform the iOS experience is.  *Different apps all function similarly.* Settings make sense and are grouped together (not sure why mail doesn't have the pull down refresh like most other apps though...) EDIT: apparently it was a third party who created the down swipe and Apple has yet to embrace it. I personally hope they do

- hardware quality is out of this world. Goes without saying I suppose


Lastly, got a new device and restored all my early settings and data. No problem.

1348182704.0,107w8y,What Passbook is and isn't,zakalwe,630,92,83,"
I'm seeing a lot of confusion and complaints about Passbook. Some of this is Apple's fault, about 24h ago). But also, there's been some really bad reporting by ""journalists"" on the subject. (In quotes, because I was always taught *real* journalists do research on things they don't understand before they write an article about it.)

So

The best way to think of Passbook is like the Photo Library. It stores a bunch of stuff for you, you can save stuff into Passbook from Safari, from emails you receive, and more. If you have a Mac running Mountain Lion, you can send them wirelessly to your iPhone from there.

When you open up Passbook and there's nothing in it

So

(Unless the company decides it absolutely wants it that way. It's their call

Apps *can* save passes to your Passbook (just like they can save photos to your Photo Library), when you book a ticket for an event, and Eventbrite or whoever email you a receipt, and a .PDF ticket (for people without iPhones to print out and take to the venue) they could also send you a .pkpass that installs into your Passbook. Or you might install it direct from the website when your order is confirmed. You might scan a QR code in a coffee-shop (using any 3rd-party scanner) and it could offer to install a loyalty card for you.

(Note: no matter how a Pass is sent to you, as we'll see in a moment.)

What is a pass, that's all. That's why you don't need an app to make one; Apple provide source code for web servers to produce them.

Passbook then renders it into something pretty. Since it ends up just being a pretty graphic on your screen

There are two main reasons:

* Passes can be tied to geographical locations. They'll pop up on your lock screen when you arrive at those locations. This means that when you arrive at the event, the ticket is there on your screen ready to scan.

* The information on a Pass can be auto-updated over-the-air. You'll receive an alert about the changed info too — so if your flight is departing from a different gate

This doesn't require an app on your system either. It's all web based: if you run a web server

Long term, store credit, special offer coupons, seamless ticketing, gift cards and more — all without needing specialist equipment, printing, laminating, or anything more than a web site with a little bit of scripting on it.

Why have Passbook support in apps at all? Convenience. There's nothing a Passbook-enabled app can do that a website can't, if your airline wants to let you change your preferred seat from window to aisle, or you want to top up your travel card with extra credit, you could do that via an app, or via their website — it's up to them what they want to provide. And then the updated credit/seat allocation/whatever will be pushed to your phone.

Immediately

There is a guide to [reset the settings here.](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3964?viewlocale=en_US)

In short:

* Plug your laptop into the wall. 
* Press and hold SHIFT+CRTL+OPTION+POWER and release all buttons at the same time. 
* Count to 10
* Power ON your laptop. 

This fixed my heat issue instantly. 

Thought I would pass along the advice as many people are going to SSD's now and the temps after I swapped would have eventually fried my board.

Ok

First

**Keyboard Shortcuts**

* CMD+Space opens the Spotlight window
* CMD+Q quits the application
* CMD+W closes the current window
* CMD+Shift+3 takes a whole-screen screenshot and saves it to the desktop
* CMD+Shift+4 lets you drag the mouse to save a screenshot of a portion of your screen
* Option+Right-Clicking an icon in the Dock will let you Force Quit frozen applications
* CMD+Option+Shift+Right-Clicking an icon in the Dock will REALLY let you Force Quit a frozen application pretty immediately.
* CMD+I Opens the Inspector
* Holding CMD and clicking lets you reposition items in the menubar. You can even drag them out to remove them entirely.

**Applications to get (free unless otherwise noted)**


* [Xtrafinder](http://www.trankynam.com/xtrafinder/) - Brings tabs to Finder and lets you cut/paste files. (By default
* [Cinch](http://www.irradiatedsoftware.com/cinch/) (free trial) - Lets you resize windows by dragging to the edges of your screen
* [Cyberduck](http://cyberduck.ch/) - Really good FTP app
* [Dragoman](http://dragoman.en.softonic.com/mac) - Bulk convert file types very easily. Something that only comes in handy every so often
* [GrandPerspective](http://grandperspectiv.sourceforge.net/) - Lets you visually see where disk space is being most used. Don't be alarmed by the SleepImage file's size. That's a copy of what's in RAM
* [MPlayerX](http://mplayerx.org/) - Use this for movie watching. VLC has become kind of bloated since the 2.0 release
* [TinkerTool](http://www.bresink.com/osx/TinkerTool.html) - Allows you to easily change hidden system preferences.
* [Transmission](http://www.transmissionbt.com/) - Incredible lightweight torrent client.
* [CheatSheet](http://www.grandtotal.biz/CheatSheet/) - Lets you hold Command for a few seconds to pull up a list of all the keyboard shortcuts supported by the application you're currently in. VERY useful.
* [Fantastical](http://flexibits.com/fantastical) (free trial) - Incredible menu bar calendar app. Great gmail integration!
* [Sparrow](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id417250177?mt=12) (paid) - Badass gmail app. If you're looking for something outside of the browser to do emails
* [f.lux](http://stereopsis.com/flux/) - duh. do it.

**Default settings to change**


* In System Preferences under Language and Text you should disable ""Correct spelling automatically"" because it's super annoying.
* In System Preferences under Security and Privacy
* Right-click the Dock (easiest by the big open space near Trash) and turn on hiding. You have a 13"" monitor - reclaim some space!
* Launch Terminal
* defaults write com.apple.dashboard mcx-disabled -boolean YES
* Launch Terminal, so it's a good idea to unhide it.
* chflags nohidden ~/Library/
* Using Tinkertool:
* Under Applications
* Under Dock Options

**Random Stuff**

* Scrolling works on background windows now. This is a nice change from Windows
* Dragging files in/out of windows and applications now works extremely well. When in doubt
* In System Preferences under Language and Text you can add keyboard shortcuts
* In System Preferences under Users and Groups you can add/remove applications that launch at login.
* Activity Monitor is the name of OSX's version of Task Manager (what you'd open during a CTRL+ALT+DEL to view system processes)
* Finder works most like Windows Explorer in List view.
* If you ever find that the default application that launches for a certain filetype isn't what you'd prefer, then Change All to apply that update across the operating system.
* Don't just randomly paste things you find on the internet into Terminal. You can screw things up - especially if Sudo is in front of it! Make sure you understand exactly what it's doing first. Obviously

This is, just over 5,000 subscribers and a total of 10,000 submissions over time, but the rate of submissions is still not very high.

The result is that we're wasting moderator time and community goodwill on subdividing the information while not making an appreciable difference in how many posts people see.  I've not understood the point since I found these subreddits and the recent thread admonishing folks for not being in the right one simply brought the issue to the front of my mind again.

What do the rest of you think?  Do you believe the division is working out well

I have some personal thoughts which I'll probably share tomorrow in a regular comment, I'd prefer to not use the bully pulpit of being the thread starter give my comments extra weight, I'm just another subscriber here.

The first lady I spoke to was more than helpful
* Send my iPhone to Apple and they send me a new one for free.
* Have Apple send me a new one now

So I said I'd call them back after arranging finances, ridiculous, I know.) as well as $55 for shipping and service. I don't have this kind of money just lying around so I had to arrange with the bank for a temporary extension on my limit, which they were nice enough to do :)

A couple of hours later, found out we were both students. Thats when he said 
&gt; So since you're a student, I'm just going to check something. 

After a few minutes passed, he told me
&gt; Hi 'tardtasticx', sorry about the inconvenience but I think it'll be in your best interest.
Then I heard him sort of snicker down the line

I was then transferred to another agent, I asked 
&gt; How come I was transferred to someone else? Did I get through to the wrong department or something? haha
Andrew:
&gt; Oh well the CSR you spoke with before wasn't authorised to do a few things we're going to do today. He mentioned to me your a student
Me:
&gt; Yeah
Andrew:
&gt; Well, and decided we would waive the shipping and service fees for the express replacement, how does that sound?
Me: 
&gt; Oh wow
Andrew:
&gt; Not a problem mate
Me: 
&gt; You can count on it!

And thats why I thought I'd post this here :D

He talked a lot about how he'd rather I have a good experience with Apple than a bad one and make them lose custom with other people. 

It shows that even though Apple are such a big company

I feel pretty confident now that I've spent my money wisely. I don't have to find the time to go to a store and get my phone sent off for repair, and pay for the courier to come pick my old one up a few days later. 

Hope this perhaps persuades someone to buy Apple, they make quality products, and if they fail, they stand by them still and go out of the way to fix it. 

Thats my story for today :D
