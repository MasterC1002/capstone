What is inspiration? No one seems to know. But they do know what inspiration does. Inspiration makes you jot down ideas on napkins. Inspiration wakes you up at 3am and forces your hands on the keyboard. Inspiration makes you crazy, somehow, into a writer.

The problem with inspiration is that it's a good story, dramatic, *sexy* about pounding out a novella fueled only by caffeine and determination through endless sleep-deprived nights. There's hardly anything interesting at all about constructing a novel slowly, over the course of weeks, months, even years, and having small

Inspiration is a story we want to come true, ultimately, fake.

For a while I've been wondering why Hemingway's quote, I finally made the connection: like anything else, ""writing drunk"" is appealing because it invites us to change our mental state into something different.

And changing our mental state is where

It's a myth that won't die, waiting for Inspiration to strike us at any moment, and eventually we have the realization that we're Doing It Wrong; inspiration doesn't lie in the mind of the sober! We must get drunk, get high, go 48 hours without sleeping, or some other quasi-religious ritual to get in touch with our inner creative self.

The reason for this, our Inner Writer, our Muse, our Creative Spirit, to be a writer, and for the rest of our conscious mind to reap the rewards.

And even if that were possible

The point is, or buzzed, or what have you.

What's worse about this is that inspiration isn't fake, and that can only happen if you are *already thinking*. And yes, you may think better during a certain time of day, or with certain music playing, or in a specific place, or whatever. But the point is that you aren't just sitting there waiting to be inspired during those times; you are already puzzling your way towards an idea when creativity happens.

The point is, and stop acting like there's some writerly part of you that needs unlocking first. Because while that may be a good story, I think actually managing to achieve your dreams, even if it's through things as humdrum as hard work and practice, is much more narratively satisfying.

1363010217.0,1a2xxl,Original Ideas Considered Harmful? (x-post by request),WillWeisser,200,22,79,"Sorry to double-post

It's an oft-repeated maxim in writing that good ideas are overrated: a good writer can make a good book out of an awful idea, first brought to my attention by Brandon Sanderson, tells the origin of Jim Butcher's [Codex Alera](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Alera) series. To quote Wikipedia:

*The inspiration for the series came from a bet Jim was challenged to by a member of the Delray Online Writer’s Workshop. The challenger bet that Jim could not write a good story based on a lame idea

The moral of the story, when you could be using that time to write (and thus becoming a better writer in the process).

There's a flaw in this story which I'll elaborate on later, and each of these scenes requires at least a few ideas to make them interesting (to say nothing of the ideas needed for characters, the setting and the premise of the book as a whole), it's clear that a professional novelist absolutely must be able to generate a lot of ideas quickly to stay in business. Of course, we don't want to write books by always chaining together the first things that pop into our heads (at least, I assume we don't; who knows, I haven't tried it), once we have the ""big picture"" laid down the way we like it

Now, because I was a longtime sufferer of the ""is my idea good enough?"" syndrome. In my particular variant, I had an unhealthy, often subconscious aversion to any idea which I perceived as ""cliché"" or overdone. And I wasn't alone either: I can't count the number of times I've seen people post variants of ""how do I get past the feeling that everything has been done before?"" to various writing forums.

It's easy to understand where this feeling comes from; literature, re-using ideas that have already been done is associated with plagiarism; do it too much, and you might be labeled a hack. Sure, maybe there's really no use in trying to be original since everything has been done before, but we don't want our books to be like everything else, do we? We want to be special, and if that means we have to try a little harder

It's a convincing fiction, and in many cases may actually limit the potential audience for your work.

The basic tenet of my thesis is this: when consuming media

Rather than speculate on how this came to be (I have some ideas, for whom we purchased a Netflix subscription a few months ago (ah Netflix, ultimate tool of the lazy parent). Right now, he's on a massive Spiderman kick--every time he sits down, it's Spiderman, Spiderman, Spiderman,000 Spiderman cartoon episodes available for streaming. Except, where Spiderman fights the ice monsters. Over and over and over. It's a pattern he's engaged in ever since we started letting him watch TV: unless you demand that he watches something else

Of course, while others are put off by anything that isn't very different from what they've seen before.

Personally, my unscientific viewpoint is that the majority of humans actually fall closer to the familiarity-seeking side of the scale than the opposite. Just look at popular music: remember the [Four Chord Song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pidokakU4I)? Those with a background in music theory know that this video isn't just a clever joke: most rock songs really are very structured very similarly, drawn from a small set of intervals that people are used to hearing, which in turn makes those intervals sound pleasing to western ears. Then there are genres where the differences are even more shallow, like the blues; there are blues fanatics who would gladly listen to blues every day, even when almost every song uses the same twelve bar progression or the same minor pentatonic scale!

In terms of print, and others where the same concepts are recycled over and over (space opera, etc.). But for the most part, if you survey the most popular works from any given genre, you'll find that they borrow liberally from popular books that came before.

And here's the key point: *this is not a bad thing*. On one level, toss them a curveball once in a while the same way a good songwriter will sometimes change up and add an accidental or put in that iii chord before the V-IV-I turnaround. But if you examine the above-mentioned popular books, you'll see for yourself how light of a touch they tend to use with originality: they pick one, maybe two existing tropes and invert them, or inject one completely new concept, but leave the rest of their genre's conventions alone. And that's what *most* people crave: to have their hands held, then be shaken up just a bit before being gently placed back into their comfort zone.

And therein lies the flaw in the Codex Alera story: ""Lost Roman Legion"" crossed with ""Pokémon"" isn't a lame idea at all. It's actually an *awesome* idea, try doing an elevator pitch for a complex, completely original story and watch an agent's eyes glaze over, then repeat the process by saying ""it's X meets Y!"" (example: Tale Spin in the Warring States Period) and observe the result.

So, and you need to dial it back and start stealing more. Start with the Tale Spin thing. That one's free.

P.S. Please don't interpret this article as me encouraging people to defy their own artistic sensibilities for the sake of sales.

**Ex.** Johnny walked past the table of otakus and flipped over the lunch tray at the end with a casual air. He didn't even bother looking over his shoulder as his victim stared after him with mashed potatoes in her lap. **(YES)**

* **Dialogue tags.** One of the most useful and contentious tricks of writing fiction prose, you don't even have to tag dialogue). Dialogue tags are not capitalized - they are an extension of the dialogue that comes before them. If you are continuing dialogue with a break in the middle for a dialogue tag, the previous piece of dialogue should be closed off by punctuation, usually a comma. 

**Ex.** ""How could you do this to me?!"" She sobbed. **(NO)**

**Ex.** ""This is the cruelest thing you have ever done

* **It's vs. its.** The former is a contraction of ""it is""

**Ex.** ""**It's** a boy.""

Listen to the people speaking around you. People don't usually use the names of others while speaking to them unless they are a) very angry

* **Mixed tense.** There are three major tenses used in writing: past, learn the difference. 

* **Mixed perspective.** There are two major perspectives utilized in writing: third person (either limited or omniscient), second person perspective is generally frowned upon by many editors and is notoriously difficult to pull off. 

* **-ly ending adverbs.** The lazy writer's friend. If you feel the urge to write the following, calmly, angrily, etc...

**Ex.** ""Quit using those goddamned -ly ending adverbs!"" Ronin said angrily. **(NO)**

**Ex.** Ronin held out a copy of *On Writing* as she stalked towards the fledgling writer. She brandished the book before the amateur's downward-cast eyes

[props to ohgobwhatisthis for providing a much better example than I did]

* **Exposition dumps.** This is where the writer has a shit-ton of information that they need to convey to the reader, and characterization, they decide to just lump it into a paragraph. See [Basil Exposition.] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJR1H5tf5wE&amp;list=PL3315B59A64D820AB&amp;feature=iv&amp;annotation_id=annotation_536151&amp;src_vid=E-PIidaqCyU)

* **Overuse of passive voice.** As opposed to active voice, especially when dealing with narrative action. Sometimes passive voice is necessary due to the context of the scene, but in many cases it can be eliminated for the active voice in order to bring more vibrancy to a piece of writing.  

**Ex.** The proposed initiative to limit passive voice was being bitterly opposed by some writers. **(NO)**

**Ex.** Some writers stood in bitter opposition against the initiative to limit passive voice.**(YES)**

* **Lack of conflict.** You have 2, is a strong source of external conflict.

**Ex.** Boring short story – Wife thinks about how dull her life has become. Does nothing about it

**Ex.** Cool short story – Wife is abused or neglected by her husband

* **OVERUSE OF EXCLAMATION!!!!** No, an exclamation mark can be suitably removed in exchange for making the entire piece of dialogue stronger, and the all-caps YELLING dialogue can be replaced with the smoother, more stylish *italics.*

**Ex.** “Oh my God

* **Semicolon abuse**. Somewhere, and indiscriminate dashes lead to James Joyce. Given his notorious wordcount (or lack thereof) nobody wants that. So don't let it happen to you. Learn how to use irregular punctuation correctly. You have to master the rules before you can break them. 

* **Giving up because somebody said something mean about your writing.** Writing is a tough sport man. People always think of writers as these frilly guys (or gals) hanging out in coffee shops with their laptops and their fluffy cats

* **Not starting at all**. Common excuses: I have too much homework, I haven't finished my outline yet, I haven't finished worldbuilding yet, I'm not satisfied, I'm not ready, I can't do it. Suck it up and write. You're never going to be in perfect conditions. Your first drafts are always going to be shitty. Even Stephen King's first drafts are shitty. Just shut up and write.

The month of November is upon us. You may have heard tell of a certain event. An event national in scope. An event in which considerable quantities of writing are to be produced. Perhaps this is an event you would like to be a part of. But perhaps

But all is not lost. For those of us who have, or even for those who are participants but want to make it something more than it already is, I present to you an alternative: get your shit together.

Not enough

And the name of this month shall be:

### National Get Your Shit Together Month.
----
#### The gist of GYST
Writing a novel in a month is all well and good

Many of us do not

#### How to participate in GYST
Make a list of the shit in your life that is not together. Yes

Why a list of everything in your life? Because writing isn't something that occurs outside of life. Yes, we may have our creative oases far apart from everything else. But really, all that stuff is an illusion. We're still very much *alive* when we're writing (for some of us, it may be the time we are *most* alive, which is a really good indication of shit not being together). So, paradoxically, writing may not be the primary focus of everyone's GYST experience. But that's because, your shit must first be at least somewhat together.

By the end of the month

1. Fixed.
2. A plan has been made to fix it
3. Nothing more can be done at this time.

If you have confronted everything on that list

#### The shared goal
One thing that should be on everyone's list is to establish a writing routine. That is the end goal here: to develop good writing habits. However, make as accurate of an assessment as you can about the togetherness of your shit. Maybe you can start working on writing today; maybe you won't be able to even *think* about writing for the next few weeks. Do what you have to do.

To that end, than you did coming into it. That's it. You don't have an explicit writing goal this month, but you do have to make sure you are *more capable* of producing writing than you were before.

1338148405.0,u7n28,The first rule of Write Club.,danceswithronin,63,5,8,"This week the writer's block is back. Like most writers, never opened.

I would take a picture of these things

**The first rule of Write Club is that no one gives a shit about your desk.** Your desk has nothing to do with your writing. Hemingway wrote in cafes. Stephen King started out at a child's desk that he could barely fit his gangly knees under. Grisham wrote on the subway on steno pads. Chee writes on trains in sleeper cars. Capote wrote in bed. Thomas Clayton Wolfe wrote on the top of a refrigerator. 

Try finding pictures of this. With the exception of Capote (that flamboyant bastard) you won't. That's because these people were too busy writing to have their pictures taken. 

**The second rule of Write Club is that you don't spend more time talking about writing than you spend writing.** Of course writers are going to talk about writing, maybe one day soon, maybe years from now - you are going to die.  So now is the moment you ask: do you want to be remembered as someone who talked about his unfinished novel a lot, or do you want to be remembered as a writer?

**The third rule of Write Club is that if you stop, and/or give up, based on criticism or laziness or the general inability to effectively manage your lifespan, the writing is over.** You can call yourself a writer if you sit around talking about notes and outlines and drinking and reading and musing, but writers do one thing: write. All the time. Short stories. Screenplays. Blogs. Articles. Stageplays. Novels. Writing prompts. Novellas. Books. No matter how shitty your writing is, if you are writing, then you are a writer. If you are not writing

**The fourth rule of Write Club is that there are only two guys to a story: you against yourself.**

**The fifth rule of Write Club: one story at a time.** Finish it

**Sixth rule of Write Club: Your tools don't matter.** Pens, cats, writing books, influential novels, highlighters, napkins, index cards, notebooks, iPads

**Seventh rule: Submissions will go on as long as they have to.** You can work on something for three hours or three years. But do not stop until you are finished with it

Their plot ideas feel overused and they want to mix it up a bit. Perhaps they’re worried about stepping on a published author’s toes by writing a story that seems too close to one that author has released.

What a load of garbage.

A long time ago, he had a lot to say on the subject. The one thing he said that sticks out more than anything else is this: There are no original plots. There haven’t been any for a very long time. The fact is that there’s a limited amount of things somebody can even *do* if what they are going to do is worth making a story of it.

I wanted to disagree. It was so discouraging

Being a contrary child, you can put together your thoughts fairly coherently, but *what is the point?*"" In trying to create an original plot, I wound up not telling any stories at all.

**So, then?**

The point, far from limiting your creativity, **truly sets you free.** An interesting plot can certainly drive a story, but plot is ultimately unreliable when it comes to engaging readers. Everyone has a different preference, plots they prefer over others. On the other hand, settings are as complex and mysterious as the writer’s imagination will allow. The pacing and tone of the story are entirely yours to command. Characters are as many and varied as the people or things that inspire them. While your protagonist may walk a path walked by thousands or millions before them, they are still a unique personality

I use the analogy of food frequently when I discuss this subject because I cooked professionally until health forced me out of it, through global trade, to a truly unprecedented variety of ingredients, the amount is still limited to what already exists. But the point of cooking isn’t to provide all new ingredients. The point is to use existing ingredients in such a way that you make something that, if it isn’t entirely original, is nonetheless innovative or otherwise inspired.

That’s what writing is

Using this type of vocabulary allows you pull apart your text and analyze what’s working, and what isn’t. Sometimes things will run together (character and dialogue) and that’s okay, it’s still useful to think about stories in these terms.

Now you're stuck knee-deep, has either changed or is muddled to the point where it hardly even matters anymore. And the stuff that has come out is shit. The characters aren't fleshed out enough. This chapter doesn't lead into that chapter in the way you want it to. Every time you write something that you think sounds great, you reread it only to discover that it sounds like you're trying way too hard. And all that besides, the plot that you thought was so cool? It's boring. You've thought about it so much that you can't possibly imagine what you saw in it at first.

Somehow you've gotten this far. But is it worth it to keep pushing? What's the point? Shouldn't you just start afresh? Cut your losses and start something new

**NO.**

Now, my opinion, man, but I'm a very firm proponent to doing everything you can to finish each story you start. I want to explain why, and how. It's easier than you think. Really, it is. No, I know, how fucking painful every fucking word can be

I used to hop from one story to the next. Didn't finish anything, I realized that, like [this guy](http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/u5n4x/i_just_want_to_tell_a_good_story_is_that_too_much/), I had nothing to show for it but broken fragments of stories, unfleshed-out ideas, half-formed characters, etc. So I decided, that I would start a new story (hah) but THIS TIME I would push myself and finish it

And guess what? It was shit.

But, I was hooked.

Finishing a story is hard. Sometimes it's easy, particularly if you're smart and sailed through school without really having to push yourself to the limit. You feel like you've lost the thread, like there's no hope for anything, like a failure. Those feelings are not something you would normally volunteer to deal with. So it's easier to just cut your losses and start afresh. Feels good. But those bad feelings are precisely the ones that you will **and should** have to go through one way or the other if you want to finish anything worthwhile. 

Listen. Not everything you write is going to work. A lot of it won't. A lot of it should just remain hidden in the recesses of your harddrive and should never be shown to anybody under any circumstances. And guess what? That's **fine.** It sucks

But if you don't finish your story

That initial inspiration came from somewhere. It's an itch that you need to scratch. So just keep scratching at it until you find the best way to scratch it. 

You can always edit. Always. You can take a story you wrote ten years ago and edit it. Come up with a new ending, you can steal bits and pieces from it and make something new. But you need to have something there to work with. 

What's more, so that your next story, which you can start AFTER YOU FINISH THIS ONE, will be that much better.

So keep going. All those doubts, you suck, you're a shit writer, you don't know how to put words together, your sentences sound like they've been dragged along the highway for three hundred miles, your characters are idiots and they're not doing what they're supposed to, the reader will never get it

Don't listen. Just keep going, one page after the other, one chapter after the other, one story after the other, one book after the other. Story isn't working? Skip ahead a bit if you need to. Edit your earlier chapters. Delete, as I once did, 16, a daily time limit

Addendum: Okay, some stories really just don't work and they're never going to and you were an idiot for even thinking they would. If you really really really want to abandon something, go ahead. But at LEAST put SOME kind of ending in there, even if it's as stupid as ""Then a meteorite came and blew them to smithereens. FUCK YEAH.""

The principle itself is valid, there is no reasoning

As came up a lot in my [How To Swallow Criticism When You're Told You Suck](http://redd.it/13etgh) thread, in most cases, but sometimes there are things you need to put together yourself. That being said, a ‘general practice’ rule that so many swear by doesn’t fall into the latter category of self-definition. 

The biggest bone I have to pick with advice like SDT is the fact that it doesn’t actually show or tell you much of anything as a stand alone piece of advice. The heart of your problem may be that you aren’t showing as much as you’re telling, it doesn’t push you one lick further, especially if you’re new to writing and getting it over and over again (which seems to be the case a lot of the time).

A fellow writer of mine got the advice that they needed to show and not tell. They let me read over their story, and went as far as to have an entire scene dedicated to how one character built their sandwich. The problem with this is that nobody is actually going to read anything that is fully just descriptions of everything in excruciating detail. It detracts from the things that actually need to be described, because the whole story turns in to a Shakespearian hoj poj of lengthy descriptions.

It is not impossible to turn ‘Show, as a good time to tell instead of show, being Darth Vader’s famous line, “I am your father”. Many people have forgotten that simply saying the shortest and simplest form of something doesn’t always make it the best way to say it. Grammar Girl also has an engaging article on the subject, along with a host of other blogs and posts from around the internet. If it is really this easy to expand on, why do people refuse to do it in their regular dealings with critiques?

I say the same reason we still hear things like `Never do xyz` and `Always do abc`, because they are over generalized, widely unsupported with examples to the particular work, and do not apply to *every* situation, though the persons saying it would have you believe they do. Everything needs a balance of sorts, and these lazy, vague pieces of advice rarely address what that balance is. I wouldn’t expect a piece of historical non-fiction to detail everything in all sorts of details all the time, because sometimes that’s what makes it a fun read. These ‘writer rules’ are more like guidelines that only apply *some* of the time for most of the work. The sooner people begin to realize that sticking to these mantras of old for the sake of tradition is not actually as good as using things that are actually helpful,,

1363699791.0,1alaf1,The Joy of First Drafts,jacklusted,29,2,6,"This is cross posted from my website so the first part may not make much sense.

As I want to talk not just about the progress of my books but also the process of writing them

To me the most important role of first drafts is this:

**They tell you what is wrong with your story.**

This is awesome. Actually it's not awesome
I work from an outline, or if the pacing is all over the place (it is). You can only judge that once you have a whole story in front of you.

Sure you can spend ages on each chapter in your first draft

Remember that story is everything with a book

**They help find your characters voices.**

Sometimes characters jump full formed into your mind

Having your characters worked out also feeds back into your story

This is great. 

Embrace this and change the story as needed to fit them because it will make both stronger. You will have a story that moves with characters and characters actions that fit with the personality you have given them.

So coming to the second draft you will hopefully have a much better picture of the characters you are writing and be able to feed that into it

**They let you suck.**

This may be more important than either of the two points above. First drafts will be bad, getting a story finished and then making it better.
I often see budding writers on the internet saying how worried they are that what they are writing is bad, kick it into the back of the closet in your mind and lock it away. Take your chance to just write what you want (though don't go insane, remember the story you are meant to be telling), and get it done. 

Be proud that you have finished something, and maybe a few trusted people whose advice you value, and **no one else's!**

You still have to make it good. 

So go and finish your first drafts, and then get on with finishing the book to the absolute best of your abilities.

To the standard observer, push past just the initial month burst. But I think the differences are bigger than that: Nanowrimo is almost about empowering yourself, to give yourself the confidence that you *can* write a novel, and it technically only takes a month. SU&amp;W lives in reality: we want to produce good writing - something good enough to publish - and realistically, that takes more than a month of glorified free-writing. 

Don't get me wrong. I actually think Nanowrimo is a great idea. There are many people out there who just think they can't do it

However, wrote the book [*No Plot? No Problem! The Low-Stress, High-Velocity Guide to Writing a Novel in 30 Days*](http://www.amazon.com/No-Plot-Problem-Low-Stress-High-Velocity/dp/0811845052), and while it address the goal of Nanowrimo, it does *not* aid in the endeavor to write a good first draft of a book.

Why? Because having no plot *is* a problem! There is no story if there is no plot.  And if someone participating in Nanowrimo wanted to actually use their book for something other than a feel-good accomplishment

I'm not sitting here saying that everyone who does Nanowrimo doesn't have plot. I'm sure there are many who do.  In fact

---

You may be wondering what I mean by plot. I'm not particularly scriptive when it comes to the details. I personally love to experiment with structure. There are many places to find more information on plot. [This article](http://suite101.com/article/the-five-basic-elements-of-plot-structure-explained-a262022) explains the basic plot structure of any story, [Book 2](http://www.amazon.com/dp/158297294X?tag=theevepeosgui-20&amp;camp=14573&amp;creative=327641&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=158297294X&amp;adid=1AR15XN7H4WC5WEB58F0&amp;&amp;ref-refURL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.musik-therapie.at%2FPederHill%2FStructure%26Plot.htm), and [Book 3](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1582973253?tag=theevepeosgui-20&amp;camp=14573&amp;creative=327641&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=1582973253&amp;adid=1AT0VHQYX57HT0W258P1&amp;&amp;ref-refURL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.musik-therapie.at%2FPederHill%2FStructure%26Plot.htm)  

What I would like to stress about all this seemingly complicated talk about plot and structure is having a *conflict* and having it *early on*.  There are ways to expand the exposition in interesting ways (i.e. mini conflicts), so extending the resolution is also a bad idea. The whole middle part? Filled with *obstacles* in achieving the conflict.  

Once you have a conflict, then you have plot. It's not as hard as it sounds, but it's the most basic and necessary part to story-telling there is.

To clarify, but rather plot is just a fundamental you need to *have* a story. Just ask [Steven Spielberg](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpevTh7Ve9A&amp;feature=fvwrel).

**TL;DR: You need conflict to write a story.**

*Edit*: There has been a lot of discussion about the definition of ""plot"".  I apologize for not making this clearer.  Plot, not this definition.  Please refer to [the Wikipedia page on narrative plot](http://tinyurl.com/yfa8hsm). Aristotle felt that plot was a beginning, middle and end, and Freytag was the guy who went specifically into the whole inciting incident, rising action, climax, falling action, middle (character obstacles)

When referring to Chris Baty's book, but please note that I am not one of them. My whole point with the plot structure is that some people get to the end of the month and can't actually do anything with their book because it has no... intrigue and suspense. In a way, conflict creates the traditional idea of plot.  I'm also not stressing planning versus ""pantsing"" as some people have suggested. You can invent conflict on the fly. It just needs to be there.

So when we go back to his book ""No Plot? No problem!"" I'm only referring to plot structure period.  Baty is referring to the fact that you don't need to preplan every event in your book before you write it. I actually agree with this,False,,t5_2u32d,1353974182.0,tag-structure,,t3_13t8zu

1369772412.0,1f7yu5,How I Chose My Amazon Keywords,WillWeisser,27,4,5,"I'm in the process of getting my first full-length novel ready for publication, so that others can benefit or tell me what they think I'm doing wrong.

Just to make it clear: I don't claim any proven results from this method. The below is just what I chose to do based on some logical inferences

**What is an Amazon Keyword?**

When you publish a book on [KDP](https://kdp.amazon.com), your book will appear in the search results. There are three main criteria for what constitutes a ""good"" keyword:

1. Volume: How often is a keyword searched for? If no one is looking for books with a particular keyword
2. Competition: How many other books use the same keyword
3. Relevance: Is your book going to appeal to people who are searching for this keyword? It's nice to appear in the #1 position in a search for romance novels

**Aside: Categories**

Choices of categories and keywords are intrinsically linked with each other, i.e. your book doesn't need to be ranked as high in them to appear in a bestseller list. One thing to keep in mind is that this concept is only useful if your book is already selling well; in other words, lets say I have two categories available:

* Category A's #10 book is ranked 3
* Category B's #10 book is ranked 50

If my book is ranked above 50, because it will show up when readers browse the bestseller list for that category. However, unless you already have an established audience, odds are when you first start out your books will start ranked somewhere around 800k or higher. In this case, category A is a better choice, because then people who find your book via keyword search in that category will find your work more relevant, and you aren't going to show up in the top 10 for either category anyway. Once you've done the legwork and sold enough copies of your book to rise above the 50k mark

So

**Step 1: Brainstorm**

Create a new spreadsheet, remember what makes your book special; the elements you thought of that made you want to write it in the first place. Write a synopsis, and go through it chapter by chapter looking for ideas. Mine settings, characters and plot devices. The trick here is not to worry yet whether a keyword is good or bad--this will only slow you down. The next two steps will take care of whittling down the list, so just let ideas flow out of your brain unimpeded for now. Some tips on keywords:

* As mentioned above, although perhaps it makes your listing look a little cheesy.
* Conversely
* Don't be afraid to consider common two or three (or more?) word phrases. These so-called ""long tail"" keywords are often under-utilized.
* Make sure you consider variant spellings and different ways of saying the same thing (werewolf, wolfkin, lycanthrope, etc.), though Google will help with this (see step 2). 
* Generic keywords like ""fantasy"" are generally useless because there is too much competition

**Step 2: Look up Volume**

The 100,"" here; we're making somewhat of a leap in faith that the number of people searching for a keyword on google is approximately proportionate to that same keyword on Amazon. Whether or not this generally holds true in real life is debatable, but since the Adwords data is the best we have, we'll go ahead and use it anyway, secure in the knowledge that at least we're not just leaving things to blind chance.

So here's what to do:

1. In the ""Word or phrase"" box
2. Leave ""Website"" blank. Set ""Category"" to ""Books &amp; Literature"" to improve the quality of keyword suggestions.
3. Click Search.

You'll be given two tables of data; the first contains the monthly search volumes for your keywords, but sometimes you'll find some good ones in there. Ignore the ""Competition"" column, it tells you how many people are bidding on an Adwords keyword and is of no use to you. That leaves two more columns of data: Global Monthly Searches and Local Monthly Searches. The ""local"" column means searches only from your selected region (the USA by default). I tend to use the global data instead since people buy Amazon books from all of the world, but to each his own. Whichever you choose, copy the numbers from that column into your spreadsheet, along with any additional keywords you want to use.

**Step 3: Look up Competition**

Sort your spreadsheet by volume number, they're essentially fictitious, except for their values *relative* to each other. So, if one keyword has a volume of 42,000, and another has 46,000,000

Now comes the tedious part. This process could be automated using the Amazon APIs, so I'll just continue as if we're doing this by hand:

1. Open amazon.com and in the dropdown next to the seach box
2. Enter your first keyword and search.
3. On the search results page, but it is more conducive to estimating how popular your book needs to be for a given keyword. As your Amazon rank rises, so will your position in the ""Relevance"" search as well (I assume), just not in as predictable a manner).
4. Scroll down to the bottom of the page
5. Scroll to or search for ""Amazon Best Sellers Rank."" It will say something like ""#XXXX Paid in Kindle Store."" That is the rank you need to beat to come up on the first page of global results. Note it in your spreadsheet in a new column. If you like, it's still not much good to you if they are the 300 most popular books on Amazon!
6. Back on the result page, click ""Kindle eBooks"" and select it from the new list that comes up. If it's still not listed, then no other books in your category use that keyword--this *might* be a good thing, but it might also indicate that the keyword in question is not very popular with readers of your genre.
7. If the category is present
8. Depending on your dedication level and how popular your categories are, but in general you'll find after few searches the results are pretty predictable for how much a rank will go up for each child level. In my case, one of my categories is Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy -&gt; Science Fiction -&gt; Adventure. I spent most of my time looking around in the top level and in Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy -&gt; Science Fiction, while also dipping into the Adventure sub-category for some keywords I was particularly interested in. But there's no reason to check every single category level for every single keyword.

During this process, sometimes you may have a cross-genre book, like a space opera with elements of a political thriller, that you're comfortable being listed with a bunch of political thrillers. But other times, you want to avoid attracting readers that aren't looking for what you're offering. For example, in the novel I'm publishing, there is a lot of fictional stuff about mathematics, etc. The problem is

**Step 4: Choose**

This is the easy part, you're looking for keywords that provide ""high"" numbers in all columns (keeping in mind that books numbered higher on amazon are lower ranked), but which ones you pick depends once again on your current standing and goals. Most likely, with a little salesmanship and dedication any book can break the top 300k; in this case, a medium-volume keyword where the first page contains 400k ranked books is gold. On the other hand, if you think you have the wherewithal to break 50k or even 10k with your book, then you'll want to target higher-volume, don't be afraid to go back and repeat this process later if your book grows in popularity.

**Aside: How important are keywords?**

Very important

Keywords work as a form of ""passive"" promotion; you spend a few hours one time setting them up, since it frees your time to write your next book instead of wasting it on active promotion. Chosen correctly, a good set of keywords can provide a recurring income that grows and grows with each new book you add to the market.

On the other hand, you'll realize quickly this isn't such a tall order), your blurb must draw the reader in, and your sample must seal the deal. If any of these elements are lacking, the best keyword in the world isn't going to help you at all, so while marketing can be interesting in itself, don't lose sight of what's important: putting out the best product you possibly can.

That's it. Good luck!

That depends. How much color did you add to your plot? By color, with both sides lining up on a field of battle in neat ranks before rushing headlong at each other through a hail of cannon fire? If you said the latter, you have no color in your piece. Color can come in many forms, but this post focuses mainly on adding in other points of view to the narrative, so it's not so two-sided. 

Start with your central conflict. Try brainstorming all the possible ways it can be resolved- don't forget to put in the resolutions that the protaognists and antagonists have decided! Just this alone shows that there's more than just two sides to your story. So. Start putting them in!

When adding in these varied elements, Faction C sees Faction D as heretics or traitors. Adding in these varied reactions will add depth to each faction, and to the characters.

Just because I say 'faction' or 'side', and growth is important. Growth makes characters seem less bland and boring.

What about the landlord for the apartment complex? Maybe the money will go to building a set of apartments on a better lot. See how his motives can be non-evil, and move to block the purchase. They do the right thing, but for selfish reasons. Add in an environmental group that doesn't want more pollution in the area- and will resort to violence to prevent the takeover. See now how varied and colored the conflict can be? Now, instead of a bland one side versus the other, you have a varied set of characters, with several different sets of consequences.

It was a slightly less-than-flattering post about NaNo that finally inspired me to post it. I figure it's a bit more productive for someone on the more neutral side of things to kick it off

Now, for better or for worse, a phenomenon. And the way I see it, there are two ways to interpret it:

**NaNo is great! It encourages people to shut up and write.**

NaNo *does* have a goal of actually writing, but of course that's not the point - the point is to get started on something you've been procrastinating on. For some people, they've been procrastinating on it their entire lives.

I won't go on about this part too much because it's the part of NaNo we're mostly familiar with - basically how NaNo sells itself to the public. 

**NaNo is stupid! It shields people from any real criticism.**

But at the same time,000 words of the same repetitive sentence structure over and over? Fantastic. The word ""butt"" repeated 50,000 times? You win!

Part of the NaNo culture is feeling good and accomplished about writing 50, in a month. But is this really something that needs encouragement? Start writing, yes, keep writing, yes, but if you're new to writing and you exist in a bubble for a month where everyone encourages everyone else *no matter how shitty they may be*, how is that going to impact your writing long-term?

----
In short, when you first make the leap to begin writing, that's great. I'll get behind it. But eventually I'm going to stop encouraging someone who writes crap to keep writing crap. It just seems unfair to *them*; they'll keep producing junk and think it's good. But then again, maybe NaNo is that first step for people, and needs all the encouragement it can get.

Another problem is, it's hard to do. Sure, I've failed to do it. Sure, I might want to give it a go someday. But I find much more value in finding a good pace to crank out writing year-round. Just because something is challenging doesn't make completing that challenge impressive unto itself. That's just me though.

This is kind of a long post to type out for waffling back and forth, to kick off the discussion. So what do you think? Is it *good* that NaNo is as encouraging as it is? Or is it encouraging the wrong things?

The responses were baffling and continue to be baffling to this day. Most of them bought it because they'd heard it was good, *more than one* customer told me ""well, it's boring for the first half, but if you can get through it it's worthwhile.""

The first half of the book is two hundred pages! *Two hundred*! I think we've all experienced the frustration in trying to get someone to read just ten pages of one of our favorite books. And here these people were slugging through 200+ pages of material they themselves confessed to find boring. *Why?*

I haven't a clue. Maybe it's peer pressure. Maybe after a work hits a certain degree of popularity and news stories start running about it, though - not one of them opened the book and started to read it before buying it. So don't bank on making a sale with your killer opening line.)

We’ll call one side of this fandom Ennui, “Ugh, another MMO? We already have WoW, why are you even trying to compete?” They bitch about tired character archetypes and recycled level design maps.

Lest I seem too scathing of this side of the house, really one of the only spell bindings modern man has left (I’d nominate good cooking as a distant second).

One of the reasons that tired writing is dangerous and draws the attention of the Ennui hordes is because it destroys suspension of disbelief. On the one hand, for example, the orphan/bastard king (think Alistair Theirin, Aragorn of Arathorn, and Luke Skywalker, to name a few). If it wasn’t a well-loved trope, the theme of everyman rising from obscurity to celebrity would never have survived as long as it has. But in order for it to work

Alistair, who can actually relate to that particular life experience? – but because they have been shaped into people who are as real to fans as many of the people who are walking around alive. Luke is the son of an Imperial overlord, but he’s also just a bored teenager who feels trapped in the boondocks of the galaxy – every too-smart kid from BFE, Montana or One-Horse-Town, Alabama can relate. Aragorn is afraid to turn into his father. This strikes a chord with anyone who has ever had a parent who failed them in some vital way, everyone from children of divorce to children of drug addicts. Alistair is afraid of the responsibility that is being asked of him, and doesn’t feel like he is good enough to shoulder the roles that he is expected to uptake. Speaking from personal experience

In short, favorite foods, popular culture, and – most importantly – a universe-specific conflict which drives them to continue the hero’s journey through whatever landscape they happen to be traversing, preferably with some moral ambiguity thrown in for good measure. Every hero must have moments of weakness, every villain moments of grace. These are the things that turn good stories into legendary ones.

The other side of this fandom equation is the people who believe that the universe was just fine the way it was, for lack of a more politically correct term. For these people, every *Star Wars* movie past the first three are blasphemy, no *Lord of the Rings* movie should ever have been made without mention of Tom Bombadil, and heaven forbid you ever write a sentence which might be either scientifically unsound or unbacked by wheelbarrows of lore-based research, because if you publish that sentence you’re getting a letter about it, by-gods.

These people also have their purpose, the ones who can give you the planetary specs of every sky-ball Shepard ever visited in *Mass Effect,* and could give an hour lecture on the genealogy of Westeros nobility. These folks will be buying your story when Ennui kids have already gotten bored and went home to play *Call of Duty.*

Purists are the antidotes to your plot holes and your *deux ex machinas.* Purists will *not* let you cheat, they will make your writing better if you let them. They force you to go back to your backstory, searching for ways that you can make it deeper, and as a result, bring even more emotional resonance and realism to your story. They are the driving force behind worldbuilding. And if you spellbind them, they will be reading your stories and preaching – at length – about the glories of the world you built long after those driven by novelty have forgotten what made your world so great in the first place.",Inspiration,,,

Serial fiction is slowly rising in prominence, and it slowly declined in popularity over time, until the internet made web serials a possibility.

Above all, for the writer and the reader.

What does they offer to the reader?

*  Readers can pace themselves
*  Readers can keep at pace with a community.  Excepting the people that are working on catching up
* Serials are more fluid in format.  Where a book tends to be somewhat predictable in terms of rising action, serials are harder to anticipate in the same 'there's only 50 pages left, the conclusion's coming soon' way.
*  Serials tend to *sprawl*.  With less restrictions as a whole
*  Serials offer more exciting stories, the serial author has to hook the reader, often through cliffhangers and unanswered questions.

More of interest to **you**

*  Structure.  As fluid as the serial is
*  Feedback.  Readers benefit from community, but knowing which characters are well liked or what plot devices just aren't selling can make a difference if you get that input before you write the next 5,000 words.
*  Flexibility.  You can write and not dwell on the issues of fitting in a certain pagecount or standard.  Or it can serve to get your ideas on the page so you can get them into the right format later.
*  Income.  Writing as a whole is something of a combination between an investment and a gamble.  You put in hundreds or thousands of hours and only after you're done do you cast your line into the water and see if the bait catches.  Serial writing can leverage donations, none of this precludes the eventual sale of the work as a print novel or ebook (though it may throw a wrench into the works if you're aspiring towards traditional, big-name publishers - a heads up).

Resources:

* /r/webfiction - A subreddit for web serials.
* [Webfictionguide](http://webfictionguide.com/) - A database for online serials.  See the forums for feedback from other serial authors.

**Personal Experience**

Speaking for myself, and I felt the schedule coupled with the pressures of audience expectations (though I didn't think I'd get more than five readers) would keep me going in a way that I wasn't on my own.

Serial writing was what got me in that mindset of 'shut up and write'.  I set my schedule (a proper, and later scaled up the word count I was expecting of myself to a 4,000 word minimum.  Above all else, I forbade myself from missing an update.  No excuses, whether I had an ear infection or a cold, whether I was moving, or the power died, and keep writing.

In April of 2012 (10 months in) I set up a donation button, more to slow things down than out of expectations, and I'm writing two bonus chapters every three weeks to get caught up with the backlog).

I set my expectations low, and I especially love seeing links pop up across the web, linking back to my work, even with the story still a ways from its conclusion (currently at 1,200,000 words in length, after nearly two years).  I've fallen in love with this, and I hope to keep doing it for some time.",t5_2u32d,True

**Make sure you enjoy writing.**

One of the most common rules you may find,000 and 20,001 words and you're wondering where the hell your life has gone over the last couple of months, you're probably not enjoying a damned thing.

There will not always be butterflies and rainbows.  You're going to want to set your house on fire and conquering that urge will make you stronger.  Nothing about that situation is enjoyable

Alright

**Love your characters.**

Fuck your characters.  

Maybe one of your characters does some really terrible shit because it feels like no one ever loved it.  That can't be true if *you* love it

Think about life for a moment.  You are the character's creator.  To the character, but don't love the character unconditionally.  It might be a jackass.

The important thing is that your character evokes some sort of emotion.  Feed that character the emotion you want and it will regurgitate it for the reader.

**You don't owe anything to anyone.**

Better watch out

**Always start from the middle.**

Start from wherever the hell you feel like.  In some cases

**Try not to know how it ends.**

Doesn't really matter.  If you need to have the feeling that you're writing towards *something*, prepare yourself for anything and everything and don't be afraid to run alongside if the plot you've forged so meticulously decides to fly off the rails halfway through.

One night you wake up from a fever dream, ready or not, you're about to write a book.  And you're damn right, you should.

But before you go approaching this task like you work the handful of short stories you've written

First, but they can be lumped together with your carbon, or main building blocks.  Your approach, your methodologies, they will be different.

Second, it's rather easy to plot the 1-3 characters and their traits, plot the points that lead to conflicts, climax, and resolution, if any.  But a book, you'll need the much more preparation.

I'll use my current project as an example without going into too much detail.  I need to *______________ before I begin writing.  These methods change from writer to writer

1. Structure

a. Dog finds a bone.

b. Bone has magical powers.

c. Dog can understand humans.

d. Dog overhears master in trouble.

e. Dog helps master.

f. Dog loses bone.

g. Dog accepts his ordinary life

2.  You're still not writing.  You going to flush out your outline several times.  All details, to the dialogue the dog hears, every single detail needs to be in place.  Expert writers used to the novel format don't need this.  But you do.  You're doing all the preparation now, in order to free your mind to write.  Change to the plot and structure can be made.  This is an evolution of creativity.  But from a beginner's standpoint, you have to understand the convention before you deviate from it.

3. Now that you have as much detail and structure as you can stand

a. Read books about the canine relationship with dogs and owners.

b. Read books about talismans, and their presumed magical properties.

c. What human problems can a dog help solve?  Will it be entertaining?

This section is used to expose weaknesses the reader might find in your logic, jotting down questions, posing answers to yourself, and acting like a crazy person, allowing ideas to hit you and being prepared to write them down in church, on a subway, in the middle of sex.  Anywhere.

4.  Here's the part where you stop talking or seeing people.  You write.  You come home from work, you look at the dust on your TV.  You sit down and write, you might get up and pace with pad and pencil, you sit down and write more, thinking what crap it is.  But you move on, blind faith and the idea that you trust your story completely.  You must trust in this, or else it'll show in your writing.  Your doubt will show.

5.  You've written all scenes outlined, add sections- this is your first edit.  It will take a large amount of time.  This is the equivilant of having a mound of clay in front of you and you must craft it so people who view the end result will see the same thing you saw all along in your head.  This is the hardest part of a very hard process.

6. Continuity, each character must build themselves up, surprise the reader, gain the reader's trust, all progressively.  And most important, the story must lay itself out slowly, quickly, so the reader is neither overwhelmed nor bored.  A good novel carries with it a delicate balance.  And now that you've edited and sit with your second draft

The characters must change in a logical way, must build properly, and there should be several moments where the reader expects one thing and something entirely different happens.

And we failed.

Which is a good thing

----

You have to be a little bit delusional to create a subreddit that acts as an alternative to another subreddit with tens of thousands of subscribers. /r/shutupandwrite is one of those experiments that was built to fail. And with something that is made to fail

It worked. After a few extremely well-thought-out essays and a brief period of one user dropping entirely more knowledge than anyone on the subreddit could handle at once, for example. Or the occasional post that inevitably got ignored. But these were just the creaks of an abandoned house settling; /r/shutupandwrite was, and remains, fairly dead.

Running a community is a fair bit like writing, that this is the novel that's going to make you rich, or famous, or whatever your endgame might be. Failure is the only realistic option. And you can either fail quietly, nitpicking at sentences no one will ever read, tiptoeing carefully around literary conventions, or you can fail *as hard as you possibly can*, not giving a damn how off it might sound or how absurdly silly your plot is.

You'll learn something if you take either option

I think we are awesome. I think we should take that awesome and show the rest of the world how awesome we are. If we could even take a fraction of the interesting stuff that goes on in the IRC channel and find a way to channel that into the subreddit, but who knows where we'll be in terms of reach in another half-year.

We may very well fail. But

Fiona McCrae and J.R.Lennon conducted a panel at my school about their experiences with the publishing industry.  I felt it very informative


**Biographical Information**

Graywolf Press is an independent publishing company that publishes about 30 books a year, and poetry.  They do not publish genre fiction, but rather literary fiction - I'll get into that later.

Fiona McCrae is the director of Graywolf Press.

J.R. Lennon is an author who has been published by Graywolf Press.  (He's also a professor of advanced creative writing at Cornell University.)


**Fiona McCrae on ""literary"" fiction**

Graywolf Press is a small publishing company

Additionally, unique, creative, experimental way of telling the story.  In particular, Fiona mentioned that ""a strong voice/slant and style, surprising language "" are elements that really attract Graywolf Press. 

What I got out of this is that if you really want to publish literary fiction, try scouting for smaller houses that focus on that genre.


**Fiona McCrae on book launches**

Most of you may be familiar with book launches - the idea is that you have to thrust a book into the market as soon as it's published.  If you don't thrust it out enough

However, absolutely nothing happened.  In fact, nothing happened for 7 months, and miraculously the book ended up winning an award and then there was an explosion.  Fiona says if you do manage to get published, don't lose hope if you don't sell right away.


**Fiona McCrae on literary agents &amp; query letters**

In general

Someone asked a question about query letters, and maybe even the authors and professors the writer has studied under.  She emphasized that she really likes in the query letter instances of being published elsewhere, particularly short stories published in literary magazines.  It shows her that the writer is serious about getting published and not just wildly throwing their manuscript around.

However

Finally


**Fiona McCrae on miscellaneous**

Apparently killing the mother often makes manuscripts better.
*Context (because that’s necessary when making a sweeping claim such as this): Fiona’s husband is a children’s writer, much to his dismay.  It’s a joke in the industry that killing the mom ends up improving writing, and he didn’t want to fall into that stereotype.*

Also


**J.R. Lennon on literary agents

J.R. basically just wrote letters to agents of authors who wrote similarly to him

J.R. got published by Riverhead, he has never sold that many copies of books since then.  He thinks part of the reason was that he’s a writer of literary fiction in a culture that’s valuing it less and less.  Luckily for him, he’s getting a bit more popular, but he said that it sometimes never gets easier to sell a book.  He still routinely gets rejected and he just has to deal with that.  Part of being a career writer is knocking on doors all over the place.

He did get published by a major house once

As for his process

Someone asked J.R. when he knows a book is finished and the answer he gave was “never. I will never, you just have to give it up and not give it another look.”


**Conclusion**

Overall, it's a constant struggle to write something others will want to read. I thought both speakers offered unique insight into the publishing world from a perspective other than the major houses.

What do you guys think?  How does your process differ from J.R.'s? Did Fiona say anything that surprised you?

 The solution I’ve found lies in embracing an open secret: all of the great creators suck in some way

Let’s look at his prose. The man was horrible at telling a story. He couldn’t write something exciting if his life depended on it. The reason for this is that the stories of Middle Earth are written in the form of histories: dry and void of emotion except for a few moments that are over far too quickly. These stories are not presented as fiction

Tolkien couldn’t move a story forward at a good pace. His entire career

Tolkien designed his characters around stereotypes rather than as individuals. As a result, because unique, relatable characters are essential to creating a moving story.

Finally, good and evil. There is no middle ground, nobody is caught by moral grey areas. Either you’re on the good side, the evil side, or entirely irrelevant to the story.

Pre-Tolkien we were given masterpieces like Alice in Wonderland, and A Princess of Mars. Tolkien decimated a vibrant and open fantasy landscape, creating a cage that most fantasy authors simply refuse to see beyond. We're held back by so many preconceived notions about fantasy thanks, in large part, to him. Those novels that break this mold stand out simply for the fact that they go against the grain.

**TL;DR:** Tolkien’s prose is boring and his characterization is bad. His plots meander

Disclaimer: So who the fuck do I think I am, and the world he created is vast, complex, and alive. I’ve spent hundreds of hours wrapped up in his books, read them through multiple times, and he’s probably one of my favorite authors of all time. This post is not meant to say Tolkien is horrible. If anything it’s meant to say the opposite. Whatever flaws you think you might have, the only way that can defeat you is if you let it. Just keep writing.

What should I be writing? Should I just let my fingers spit out any old word? I know there are days where I’m mentally exhausted and my brain is stuck on repeat. I end up thinking of  the same word thirty times in a row. Does typing this word thirty times in a row really help me write better?

Which skills are being improved? The skill of letting myself write garbage so the good stuff comes out when I’m done? What about the days when the garbage never gets out of the way? Is that still helping somehow?

Or should I focus on specific techniques? Description, etc. But if I’m focused on ‘improving’ these things, doesn’t that mean my left brain is getting in the way of my right brain?

A few years before the release of his now-classic dystopian novel, this essay packs quite a punch with the information it contains. Admittedly, some things he discusses are not as relevant today as others, but overall, it ought to be a must-read for all writers of the English language.

You may think to yourself, with [Newspeak](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspeak) in Nineteen Eighty-Four being a prime example. According to Orwell, Newspeak is such a toned-down version of the English language that speakers of Oldspeak (English) would have trouble understanding it.  Such a stripped-down language would no longer be able to convey the sincerity and conjure the imagery a language containing a much broader range of vocabulary could.

A similar effect applies to “flowery” language, as awesome as they are, can be a lot like RAM in a computer: they both have a processing limit. Try feeding a computer too much information and it slows down, sometimes even coming to a halt; try feeding too much information to another person and you will get a blank stare. That blank stare is a lot like the Spinning Rainbow of Death. It signifies when processing is at its limits. However, as a writer, much of the time you won’t be able to see those blank stares. Unable to fix your mistake in the moment, you will have to plan and prevent yourself from divulging too much information ahead of time.

1338982765.0,unsrm,Building Strong Characters,lophyte,22,4,5,"There have been several posts previously about [coming up with new characters](http://redd.it/u5aso) and [fleshing out characters](http://redd.it/u4f82) by asking questions and interviewing

The first dimension is **physical**. This is the stuff that one-dimensional characters are made of: height, age, hair colour, eye colour. All the physical, visible details we see. This may be important to you as a writer, but very little are necessary to the reader. Focus on unique physical characteristics which set your character apart from every other blonde-haired, blue-eyed damsel in distress. One of the most boring things is reading what amounts to a police suspect description of a character.

The second dimension is **sociological**. Think about your character's history. Where did he grow up? What kind of life did he live? Was he a rich spoiled brat

The third dimension is **psychological**, relationships? Is she above average in intellect, or did she flunk first grade? All books I've read on writing — and I've found it works for me too — instruct you to be a student of human nature. Watch people. Ask yourself why they do the things they do. It's amazing how many story ideas you can come up with this way too, by watching people and coming up with elaborate backstories for how they came to be.

All of these factors add up to create a real, in turn, affect how they interact with people at an older age.

In addition to all of that, to skip work for a week and party in Vegas — and each characters' desires must conflict with the others. When you have two characters who are diametrically opposed in their desires — Bob wants to write without distractions, but Mary wants Bob to pay more attention to her — you have tension. Think of it like tectonic plates, where each character is a different plate moving toward the other. Along the edges where they meet, they push and rub and build up pressure. Small little rumbles release a little bit of the tension. Finally, once the pressure hits a critical point — your climax — the tension is released through a violent and amazing earthquake.

Your character should also have a history. How detailed or not is completely up to you as the author, and so on, at least to the point where you can explain some of their key characteristics through their history. There are different approaches to creating a history for a character. Writers who do a lot of prewriting planning may create full character profiles with elaborate biographies that span several pages. Writers who write ""by the seat of their pants"" may just come up with backstory elements as they come across new characteristics while writing. There is no right or wrong way to do it, so long as you are consistent with your characters.

Making a strong

Remember, it needs to be consistent within their lives, just like real people.

The final thing is to make your characters interesting and keep them real.

*Well*

Let me elaborate. If your character gives up easily and sits in his bedroom and complains about his life

This also ties in to believability. When your character does something, would he really go jumping over buildings and getting in to firefights? Let's say there's someone after him — a hit man or the mafia or something. For whatever reason. What would your protagonist do in this situation? What is he willing to do and how far is he realistically willing to go?

Depending on the size of the magazine

The truth is

* **The query letter.**

* **The first page of the submission.**

With that in mind

* **Proofread.** For the love of gods old and new

* **Be humble.** You have not written the next *Grapes of Wrath.* Yours is only one of the dozens or hundreds of submissions a first reader will see in any given day. Saying anything to the effect of, it is the best thing since *War and Peace* and together we will win a Pushcart with it and you would be a moron not to publish it” is going to get your query letter passed around the editorial office and laughed at. True story.

* **Revise.** Once you have finished a story, you can be sure they will not read past the first page. 

* **Read the magazine you’re submitting to.** Get a subscription if you can. Most lit mag subscriptions are laughably cheap. Not only will you be helping to support and uphold the industry you are trying to get money and recognition out of

* **Don’t try to be cute.** It’s okay to be charming and show a little wit in your query letter

* **Don’t try to be edgy.** Same premise as the previous point

* **Make the first page of your story the strongest in a narrative sense.** If there is anything boring in the first page of your story, the first reader is going to assume the rest of the story is boring too, and move on to the next thing in the slush pile. 

* **Read the submission guidelines.** If the submission guidelines say that they want the manuscript in Arial, by-gods if you want to publish in that magazine you will do exactly what they say. Because here’s a secret: sometimes ridiculous submissions guidelines are a test. They are a test to see how well you pay attention, or whether you’re someone who thinks that the rules don’t apply to you (the latter is a group of people that editors hate to work with). They are a test to see how bad you want it and how professional you’re capable of being. Flaming hoops of formatting guidelines is part of that process. If you want to be published, you will follow every single instruction that is given to you. 

* **Impressions are important.** If you make a good impression or get published in a magazine, you make an ass of yourself by not following any of the rules above, the first readers will remember you, and not in a loving way. Don’t let that happen to you.  

* **Don’t send simultaneous submissions.** Granted, do not submit to multiple magazines at the same time. Simple as that. Wait for a rejection letter before sending your work out to someone else. Nothing makes an editor shake their fist at the heavens more than to go through the cut rounds, pick a story they really like, only to see that that story has already been accepted elsewhere. It’s bad form. Don’t do it.

* **Consider the person on the other side of your submission.** They are usually unpaid, hungry, thirsty, and in dire need of a stiff drink. They are in the literary business because they love good writing, the same as you do. They are not the blackhat gatekeepers who are sabotaging your efforts at traditional publication. They are just doing their jobs, which is to make sure that they get the very best stories for the publication they’re working at. They have pride in their work, and they want you to have pride in yours too.

1372545530.0,1hc12k,"Writing, wikis, and you",awkisopen,17,14, but it is an open-ended one. I've used a few wikis with varying degrees of success. Feel free to leave comments about your own experiences with wikis

###First things first: What is a wiki?
A wiki ([backronym](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backronym): What I Know Is) is a website designed for the general public to edit, which wants *everything*, the greedy bastards). With this in mind, the idea of a ""private wiki"" seems backwards. However, there are certain elements of the wiki model that lend itself to private use quite well.

###Advantages of a wiki
Most, talk pages, etc) will likely go unused in a private wiki, but the second goal &amp;mdash; ease of navigation &amp;mdash; is where a wiki as an organizational tool can really shine.

The trick to organizing one's notes is to put relevant information in a logical place to make it easy to reference later. A wiki can be very good at this if you understand how to use it properly. However

###Disadvantages of a wiki
Most &amp;mdash; again, so don't do it. Just because a page is empty doesn't mean you need to spend more time brainstorming to fill it up.

Additionally, can add an unwanted layer of complexity to your notes. Some wiki software is intuitive to use, other software isn't. If it feels like a wiki is hindering your writing process more than helping it, stop using it and use something else. Wikis aren't for everyone, and they certainly aren't for every project.

###Wiki software
If you'd like a more complete list of wiki software

####TiddlyWiki
For personal projects, a mish-mash of HTML and JavaScript.

TiddlyWiki is simple to download, note that you'll need Java installed to save any of your work on it. (There's a good technical reason for this: a static file cannot modify itself unless it calls an external program, `TiddlySaver.jar` in this case, to do the work for it.) If you want portability across *all* devices, there are definitely better options, but you won't find a wiki easier to use than this.

One of the things I personally like about TiddlyWiki is the way it solves the ""every page has way too much space"" issue by loading each page (or ""Tiddler"" as I think they're actually called) on top of the previous page

All in all I highly recommend checking out TiddlyWiki first before moving on to alternative wiki software. If you do need a wiki for writing notes

####Wiki on a Stick
Okay, literally, [Wiki on a Stick](http://stickwiki.sourceforge.net/) ([sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/stickwiki/)). You may now be confused, it's okay.

Wiki on a Stick (or, it lives in one self-modifying file. Also like TiddlyWiki, the only requirements for running WoaS are a browser and Java. Unlike TiddlyWiki, however, WoaS displays wiki pages in the more traditional, one-entry-per-page manner. So for those of you confused or disoriented by TiddlyWiki's way of doing things, give WoaS a go.

Personally, but for the time being, there's a bit of a dry spell going on.

####WikidPad
So far we've only covered solutions that work with a browser. Makes sense, I have come across an executable wiki if you want to keep your browsing and note-taking separate for some reason. It's called [WikidPad](http://wikidpad.sourceforge.net/) ([sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/wikidpad/)) and it's open-source, cross-platform software.

WikidPad does have some advantages &amp;mdash; for one thing, it's fully documented (in wiki format, of course) and comes up with this neat little reference wiki when you first start it up. It's also got at least half-assed [WYSIWYG editing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG), unlike most wiki solutions. In edit mode, the syntax is always visible, but it applies the proper formatting to that syntax as well, so bold text will appear as **\*bold text*** as opposed to \*bold text\*. You can toggle between editing and ""preview"" modes, but since you'll be spending most of your time in edit mode anyway it's a nice touch.

WikidPad is powerful: it allows for complex grouping of information, however, more complicated than other solutions, and is more suited to complex projects where you have a vast amount of information to organize. (And if you're in that situation, ask yourself if you're really writing a story!) Still, if you're looking for a non-browser-based solution, WikidPad does the job and you can ignore all the bells and whistles that come along with it.

####DokuWiki
[DokuWiki](https://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki) ([github](https://github.com/splitbrain/dokuwiki)) is one of the two server-based wikis I'll mention here

DokuWiki, this *can* be done on your own local computer using something like [WAMP](http://www.wampserver.com/en/), for instance, but if you're going to go the whole nine yards here and set up a wiki server locally, do yourself a favor and consider doing it on a real server.

Why? Portability, but remember, Java is a requirement, and not all devices play nice with that. If you choose to self-host a wiki, you could edit that shit from your phone, your tablet, everything. Simply put, secure)

However, or any other server-side wiki software *so good* that you just *have to have it*, I may do a tutorial on setting up a local server if there's any interest.

Anyway, and best of all, it uses [very similar syntax](https://www.dokuwiki.org/wiki:syntax). As an added bonus, it stores wiki pages as flat files that any system can easily read. So, for example, if you set up DokuWiki to sync with your Dropbox or Google Drive (and why wouldn't you? Backups are *great*!) any device that could access those files could also read them. It's pretty neat!

Beyond that

Edit: Also check out [MoinMoin](http://moinmo.in/) ([Mercurial repo](http://hg.moinmo.in/)), some of what I've discussed here may be more relevant with MoinMoin than DokuWiki, but either way, both are worth a look before moving on to MediaWiki.

####MediaWiki
Here it is. The wiki software everyone is most familiar with

Yes, and technical issues. Chances are, you aren't prepared to deal with any of those things, at least not without getting paid.

The initial installation of [MediaWiki](https://mediawiki.org) ([github](https://github.com/wikimedia/mediawiki-core)) isn't *terrible*, well, users, but for administrators it's a nightmare &amp;mdash; and as the person installing it, that administrator is *you*. Plus, if you're running it locally, it puts stress on your computer (Apache and mySQL partying in your RAM night and day) that it doesn't deserve. I don't care how mean it's been to you

Then there's the matter of backups. Backups are *important*, sync that up with gDrive and you're set. Hell, it's even relatively easier to back up DokuWiki because the files are easy to locate and copy. For MediaWiki, you'd have to do a mySQL database dump, which is every bit as pleasant as taking a regular dump. And that's half the battle &amp;mdash; good luck restoring that in case something goes wrong. Plus, the whole idea of running a database locally on your computer just so the web server also running locally on your computer can communicate with it rubs me the wrong way.

Don't get me wrong. MediaWiki is great for large collaborative projects

###Conclusion
In conclusion... [TiddlyWiki](http://tiddlywiki.com/). That is my conclusion for you. Give it a shot. Also, or [Catch](https://catch.com/), or a [Google document](https://drive.google.com/), or hell, a notepad and paper. But for those of you interested in the wiki end of things, hopefully I've at least given you somewhere to start.",Organization,,,

1359558651.0,17kalu,Creativity as a Science,TydVirTaal,19,5,10,"*This is the draft for an oral assignment in my Afrikaans class. It was inspired largely by the sort of thinking I've been exposed to on SU&amp;W

Our conventional understanding of creativity and the creative arts is that you are either born with an affinity for them, and if you don’t have the talent you may as well give up. Purporting this idea is the fact that, most of the time, we only ever really see the artist's finished work - the complete painting, the final draft of the story or the stage performance of the dance. We look at it and say “Wow, I could never come up with anything like that! They must be a million times more talented than me!”, without realising that the painting took countless sleepless nights

Those of us not blessed with this innate ‘talent’ from an early age begin to form some very warped ideas about creativity and the creative process. We start to think that ‘creativity’ is an ethereal quality almost like a fairy godmother. If you’ve got it, simply flow from you, entirely perfect the first time around, with hardly any effort required on your part. If you don’t got it, then sorry, but the creative arts aren’t for you. 

What many fail to realise, there are techniques that work better than others, and those who we see as ‘talented’ simply have a more intuitive understanding of which is which. A lot of what we do in subjects like English and Art is analysing what those techniques are and how well the writer or artist uses them. 

I’m sure many of you are itching to tell me that writers and artists don’t think about which techniques they’re using. You’d probably be right - most of the time I don’t think they do. That doesn’t mean they aren’t using them, the same way a sporty person might hold a tennis racquet correctly first-time, while someone else would have to be shown. 

Because of this it is entirely likely that literary critics and analysts would come up with insights into the art that the writer or artists themselves didn’t even think of when creating the work. Not because they aren’t there

What does this mean for all of us non-creative types, but in that regard nothing has changed. What does change when we realise that creativity is a science is our perceptions of our own potential. Simply put, we can be creative too, all we need to do is understand the process behind good creation. 

Our misunderstandings of the creative process stem from our misconceptions about what drives it. Ask people what begins and finishes a novel, according to them, leads to determination. 

The reality is that it actually works the other way around. 

If you sit around waiting for a good idea to hit you - as many people do - you’re going to be waiting a very long time. That’s because you aren’t putting yourself in a creative mindset (by which I mean a state of mind where you are creating things). Creation breeds creation, the voice in the back of your head is busy trying to wreck your self-esteem - telling you you aren’t good enough, that it’s a bad idea, that you should give up, give it a rest and start again. 

It isn’t inspiration that gets you to start or to finish a book. It’s you telling yourself “I want to write this book

Creativity

What this means is that creation is for everyone - it’s not something you’re born or blessed with, then, is that if you want to create then stop lamenting about how creative you wish you were.

For those of you who weren't around yesterday

It was a rousing success. Tons of new people showed up and participated in what would turn out to be the [second most active day in #shutupandwrite ever](http://shutupandwrite.net/ircstats/). Once /u/lophyte left I took over as best as I could while still actually working at the same time. Between us

I can't speak for the other participants

So I think we should do this again sometime. Namely, hopefully, a few people available to host a war or two when I have to eat or something :)

I know it's been a bit slow around here lately, well-written posts. It is also what happens when the head mod decides to be lazy for a month just because he has a job now or something silly like that.

But fear not! I have some *important announcements* to make about the month ahead! Do I mean from now until the end of September or 30 days from now? That depends on how quickly everything will get done and once we know that answer we can just pretend I was more specific here.

**Subreddit redesign!**

You're lookin' at it. Well, so it's taken a while. For the record, our current design is heavily inspired by /r/circlebroke, a subreddit I don't read but nevertheless has one beautiful layout.

**More sidebar links!**

Yeah this one's a work in progress

**An actual FAQ!**

I can't believe it either! Our [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/shutupandwrite) now contains questions

**A daily prompt subreddit!**

Soon

With your help we're aiming to make this the most consistent prompt subreddit *of all time*. The bot will update once a day every day at exactly the same time based on suggestions left in (what else?) suggestion threads.

If you just can't wait and want to check out examples of writing prompts we've linked a few in the sidebar. /r/writingprompts and /r/promptoftheday are both awesome manually-run prompt communities.

**A wiki of writing resources and essays!**

Those of you who checked out the ""FAQ"" before might remember it was actually just a list of links to useful posts. Well

**Ice cream for everyone!**

Still working on this. I'm pretty sure there's a CSS3 attribute for it somewhere.

1344308587.0,xsxmo,An argument against crowdsourced critique,awkisopen,17,2,11,"For months

Then, he wrote a long, detailed, and humorous explanation as to how he arrived at this decision. But one struck me in particular, one that I never would've thought of: as the number of suggestions grew, Hussie could simply scroll through the (pages and pages of) suggestions to find the direction *he* wanted the story to take.

In effect

Crowdsourced critique works similarly. When you post a work to a public forum &amp;mdash; say, you don't know their background. Maybe they're out to confuse and befuddle you, or maybe they're in such a good mood that they miss your flaws entirely. You just don't know.

Even in a perfect scenario where you received tons upon tons of feedback &amp;mdash; not just any feedback, you. With that much feedback, no matter how careful and unbiased you may try to be, you will start to consider some critiques to be more accurate and others to be less accurate. After all, what else can you do when faced with so much information, especially information that tends to contradict itself? Eventually you'll be left with an overall impression similar to the one you expected when you first posted your piece - for example, if you expected negative feedback, regardless of whether or not that feedback really applied.

This is one of the main problems I see with crowdsourced critique. Even in the impossibly perfect situation where everyone only posted only well thought-out critiques

More often than not, one is inclined to consider at least *some* of it to be important and relevant, when in fact *none* of it may be. Again, you still don't know anyone's background. Do they really understand what you were trying to accomplish? Even if they did, are their problems with your work truly representative of a larger population? Are they in your target audience? Should you *care* what they have to say? The answer to most of these is: probably not.

There's a further problem with crowdsourced critique, when in fact those people are typically the opposite of how they perceive themselves to be. As a result, you've got a massive percentage of the population who simply will not change their minds about their own writing skill even when faced with massive evidence to the contrary.

Why is particularly a problem with crowdsourced critique? Because in crowdsourced critique, even just online, the weight their opinion holds is truly different than if they were another anonymous poster on the Internet.

More importantly, of course, the piece should speak for itself, but if it doesn't, that's a problem that needs fixing &amp;mdash; and it can only be fixed if the critic understands the author's aim. Otherwise, it's left for people to puzzle over in the comment section, which doesn't get the writer anywhere

And this is why* you won't see crowdsourced critique on /r/shutupandwrite

**Where:** The Internet. More specifically

**How:** Do.

**What:** As some of you may know, amongst a lot of silly bullshit, we do critiques of each others' writing.

""Critical Strike"" is a writing contest that harnesses the snarkitude of our TeamSpeak critique group. It's a chance to get your work critiqued live by a bunch of slightly sarcastic, will give you some feedback you might just barely be able to do something with. It's also a chance at Reddit Gold under the most arbitrary conditions ever.

**What.** Okay, a writing prompt will be posted on /r/shutupandwrite (and possibly /r/writing). All participants will then have exactly 24 hours to write a response to said prompt of a length of about 2,500 words (but absolutely no more than 3,000 words).

Then, we will begin reading the submitted pieces aloud on a Ustream channel I haven't quite registered yet. As we read along, we will do our best to give useful feedback on the piece in question. Failing that, we will attempt to give *entertaining* feedback. Failing that, /u/wallmani will come on and sing us the song of his people.

If any entries manage to impress the critiquers enough

**Why?:** Because it's fun. None of us are professional writers or editors. This is basically the [MST3k](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_Science_Theater_3000) equivalent for writing.

What I can say is that you will get the opportunity to see the average reader's response to your style

But really that's all beside the point. First and foremost this is an experiment. We are basically opening up the TeamSpeak server to the world for a few hours and just seeing what happens. The potential for awesome is there

In response to this week’s challenge to post stuff to Shut Up &amp; Write that make me a better writer

The most vivid example I can devise from my own life was a brief foray into art.  I tried a while to sketch pictures, my attempts at watercolor using methods I observed in their art was far better than anything I would have done otherwise.  And I’m slowly starting to adopt a particular style.

This can be applied to writing. When I read Harry Potter, there’s something about his style that makes me want to write just like him.  Or when I read any poem by Margaret Atwood, particularly [Manet’s Olympia](http://biblioklept.org/2008/05/23/manets-olympia-by-margaret-atwood), I’m jealous because I wish I had written it.

Unlike other areas of life, I tried to throw some of him in while I wrote a short story.  The improvement of my writing increased far more so than it did with any other tactic. And the beautiful thing about writing is that no matter how much of a particular style you borrow, it won’t be plagiarism because your story will be different.  As long as you keep reading different things that strike a chord with you, you will always be changing your style until you become a hodgepodge of your experiences. And that’s when you’ll truly be unique.

1371359488.0,1gfusz,What We Can Learn From the The Red Wedding's Emotional Punch,therjkessler,18,7,15,"* **Spoiler Warning:** The following post talks about the “The Red Wedding” scene from the television series Game of Thrones; in particular

There are very few characters in *Game of Thrones* that I like.

The cast is wide and broad and spans multiple continents and a dozen plotlines, Davos Seaworth, Lord Varys, and Ser Barristan Selmy. A special mention goes out to the Hound, Sandor Clegane.

Robb, yet the Red Wedding hit me just as hard as it did the watchers who loved those characters. Interesting, isn’t it?

In fact, but I didn’t like them.

Yet when The Scene played out before me and ended with those silent credits

It’s been two weeks since the episode aired but I’ve only just managed to (somewhat) sort out the reasons for why that scene hits with such impact

**The power of the Red Wedding rests in the fact that it shatters two of the most basic aspects of what it means to be human: trust and hope.**

In the books (which I haven’t read) prior to the Red Wedding, but sadly it wasn’t explained until the next episode.

But the episode built up this idea of trust in other ways. Robb Stark made his apologies and the Freys seemed to accept his remorse. Walder Frey offered up one of his more beautiful daughters to Edmure Tully

And then the massacre from out of nowhere.

Betrayal is a universal emotion. We all know what it feels like to trust and have that trust ignored, we immediately lose our sense of security and it hurts. Bad.

In fact

Well, and in the world of conventional storytelling main characters don’t die. We trusted that they would live until the end and triumph. They didn’t.

But it doesn’t end there.

Throughout the Red Wedding, Hot Pie and Gendry. She’s got nothing now.

And she’s come so close to that reunion that she so desperately wanted. From a distance

Unfortunately for her

Hope is another powerful emotion that drives us. It helps us to weather the storms and to endure the night because it promises sunny skies on the other side if we just persevere long enough. Hope gives us something when we have nothing. The world would be a terrible place if we had nothing for which to hope.

So when Arya arrives at camp only to see her family and her family’s bannermen being slaughtered

The other aspects of the Red Wedding—like the gruesome violence and the implications for other plotlines—only serve to amplify these two base yet powerful violations. You don’t have to like Robb, or Arya, but when they experience the breaking of trust and the loss of hope, coupled with the finality of death, we have no choice but to share in their pain and mourn with them.",Inspiration,False,t5_2u32d,True
1371011184.0,1g6c3t,Why you can't create conflict with just an idea,Tellenue,27,14,30,"All right, in a kind of naïve way

You cannot struggle against an idea.

You can rage against it, support ‘awareness groups’, join eight different clubs trying to eradicate *the idea you don’t agree with*. But in the end, what are you actually doing?

Bitching.

I do not want to read 300 pages of your bitching. 

You want to make a point about how *the idea you don’t agree with* is wrong? You need something to embody that idea. You need someone who takes that idea and acts on it, isn’t it?). You need your character to have someone try to get in their way. Have a problem with a materialistic culture? Your antagonist must embody that culture. Hell, could probably even be a caricature of it.  There’s a world of difference between an internal monologue of a guy walking down the street thinking to himself how much everyone’s so obsessed with their smartphones, and a group of preppy upstarts who confront the guy and belittle him for not having one. If you can’t see the difference between an internalized bitching session and an actual conflict between characters, writing may not actually be for you right now. 

Still confused? Here’s some examples.

**Bitching**: Book opens to a very poignant and overly lengthy description of the protagonist’s very bare and minimal living quarters, goddamnit. And here’s a lengthy point by point essay on why he’s right. Just in case you didn’t get the message that he’s right.

**Conflict**: The protagonist works for a very important company. All his coworkers talk about is their new cars, it bit him in the ass. He got looked over for promotion because ‘what do you need the money for? Not like you’ll spend it’. Then the area is hit by a disaster. All those people who had gone into debt can’t make the proper preparations or afford the repair and cleanup they need, but the protagonist can. Does he help the people who kicked him in the ass, accepting that maybe his way isn’t for everyone? Or does he let them suffer, because they should have seen that material goods are useless, and maybe this will make them wise up?

See the difference now? So please

""Because of this - that.""

""Everything was like this

My project has been going pretty well over all. Neat concept, neat action. However I didn't like the goals of the protagonist. That is to say - I didn't like that there were *two* goals. One of the biggest problems I've had with my project is a unification of action. I rather like the simple-mindedness of the 90's high concept movies in which a character has a single, clearly defined goal that he pursues. I'd had it in mind to make the two goals into one goal. At one point I toyed with the notion of simply making them one ofter the other. So that he has one goal and then the goal switches near the end. That solution didn't please me. Though I kept writing possible draft outlines. You gotta roll the dice, right? 

Until this morning. 

I racked my brains for a solid hour (with much pacing and wringing of hands). Two goals is flatly unacceptable. Even if there are tangents, oddly enough) that Matt and Trey once said something about taking out words / phrases like ""and then"" and instead replacing them with ""because"" or ""but then.""  So I took the two goals and put the word ""because"" in between the two goals. 

http://youtu.be/G22X5X49VhM

Within the context of my story there's a character aspect that is key. With the two goals made into one the characters are actually more alive now. Which makes everything better. The action, unfortunately).

And so I have some integration in front of me. And I'm super stoked about this morning.

But it's not just about making your long term and short term goals coincide. It's also about making your goals reasonable. If you set a goal of 1K words a day every week for 8 weeks, if you set your goal to 800 words a week and consistently post 3-4K, maybe you should look at being a little more aggressive with your weekly goals. Use the data you have to find reasonable and attainable goals (the SMART goals mentioned in the check in threads). Having a goal that is attainable with some effort will do you more good than coasting through with goals that don't challenge you, or goals that are unattainable given your circumstances. ***Yes, your circumstances are important to making these goals, and don't let anything except the data tell you otherwise.*** 

Your goals should be challenging but not impossible. Track your word counts by session, if it helps you analyze it. Use it to make sure that what you're planning coincides with the efforts you can put forward- efforts backed by the data you've collected. Let the numbers do the talking. Once your goals and efforts align, you'll find a sweet spot of satisfying productivity.

1337659844.0,tyqli,Verb Tenses or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying And Love The Past,,12,3,9,"This is more of a novice tip

Telling a story requires consistency, people have no trouble being consistent with who their characters are, what they're saying or what they're doing. But they do seem to have a huge problem with trying to figure out when the story is taking place. Novice writers will typically flit back and forth between past tense and present tense (and in some cases, future tense, but if you do that, just pack it in buddy, you're done anyway). 

The thing is

So here we go

*Past Tense*

Past tense is the most prevalent way to tell a story, most stories are told in the past tense. When you tell your friends about that hot girl you found last night at the club, only to find out she was an undercover cop who wasn't looking to go up to your apartment to look at your collection of Neon Genesis Evangelion figurines, you probably tell the story in the past tense, since it happened in the past. Most novels follow the same guideline, that the narrator(s) tell the story from some point in the future. It's the most common way because it tends to be the best way to do it. It's unobtrusive because as people, we're used to hearing stories in this way.

**Examples**

John **went** down to the store and **bought** a bottle of whiskey because he **felt** like his life **had hit** a new low.

=============================================

*Present Tense*

Present tense is being used more and more in modern storytelling, don't be afraid to use present tense narration, just be aware that it might look a little weird on the page, and you can sometimes fall into a weird trap of it seeming like everything is happening at once, instead of the in the past tense where things are assumed to happen one after another.

**Examples**

John **goes** down to the store and **buys** a bottle of whiskey because he **feels** like his life **is hitting** a new low.

=============================================

*Future Tense*

Come on man

**Examples**

John **will go** down to the store and **will buy** a bottle of whiskey because he **will feel** like his life **will be hitting** a new low. John **will kill himself** because he **will be in** a future-tense novel.

In First, the book needed to explain what strengths were and what they looked like. In Appendix B, there’s a list of three Talent Groups- Striving Talents, Thinking Talents, and Relating Talents. As I was reading, it struck me. If these are the things that define real, actual, then this list could be used to define fiction characters too

But it isn’t all about strengths, fake, or unmotivated. For each talent the character excels in, he or she should have one that would stymy them. This provides them with meaningful behaviors that both strengthen and weaken them, patterns that they fall into, just like real people do. 

So

**Striving:**

*Achiever*- A drive that is internal

*Kinesthetic*- A need to expend physical energy.

*Stamina*- Capacity for physical endurance.

*Competition*- A need to gauge your success comparatively

*Desire*- A need to claim significance through independence

*Competence*- A need for expertise or mastery.

*Belief*- A need to orient your life around certain prevailing values. 

*Mission*- A drive to put your beliefs into action.

*Service*- A drive to be of service to others.

*Ethics*- A clear understanding of right and wrong which guides your actions.

*Vision*- A drive to paint value-based word pictures about the future.

**Thinking:**

*Focus*- An ability to set goals and to use them every day to guide actions.

*Discipline*- A need to impose structure onto life and work.

*Arranger*- an ability to orchestrate

*Work Orientation*- A need to mentally rehearse and review.

*Gestalt*- A need to see order and accuracy.

*Responsibility*- A need to assume personal accountability for your work.

*Concept*- An ability to develop a framework by which to make sense of things.

*Performance Orientation*- A need to be objective and to measure performance.

*Strategic Thinking*- An ability to play out alternative scenarios in the future.

*Business Thinking*- The financial application of the strategic thinking talent.

So I will warn you outright: if the only reason you want to read this book is because you want to learn how to create *short* fiction in particular - well, felt better titling his book *Creating Short Fiction* because that's what he wrote the most of.

*Creating Fiction* would have been a more accurate title

* **Developing Your Talent as a Writer.** Those of you who already have a certain degree of confidence in your writing will find this section the most unhelpful
* **Idea into Story.** Shit begins to get real in this part. If you have difficulty formulating ideas, but the way he presents idea formulation is, for the most part, wonderfully logical and interesting. This section also includes a line-by-line breakdown of one of the author's short stories that I confess to having skipped.
* **Beginning a Story.** Highlights of this section include a very convincing argument that viewpoint is more complex than the typical ""first person""/""third person"" categories allow for, that is, the author, the reader, and a single in-story character.
* **Controlling a Story.** A section mainly about problems you may run into in the course of telling your story
* **Finishing a Story.** A brief segment about what a good ending should do, etc.
* **Being a Writer.** A general mishmash of topics about the life of a writer that didn't seem to fit anywhere else in the book. I didn't agree with all of it

I cannot believe such a transformation took place in me in such a short time. It was in a large part due to lurking in this sub and listening to people debunk the common excuses that people make for themselves

Thanks for existing as a community. Thanks for getting me to

OK

**Edit:** OK

Bear in mind, and only had to take the one class, so I took a creative writing course as well.

That course instilled in me a crippling self-doubt that made it impossible to write. After the course was over

A year later, then started seeing some SUAW posts mentioned.

**TLDR - start reading now:**

SUAW taught me to expect my first draft to be rubbish. SUAW taught me that there's no single technique or trick or tip that will make me a better writer; its all your-mileage-may-vary and I just have to come up with what works for me. SUAW made me realize that if I was serious about seeing progress

This community would tastefully destroy anyone who tried to offer up the type of excuses that I found myself using; I don't have time (make time or quit calling yourself a writer)

Probably the most important thing SUAW did for me, this was a big eye opener.

1354930851.0,14h6ea,Idea Overdose - How and where the hell do I start?!,Equilibrium131,9,0,10,"I'm going to try and keep this as brief as possible
I'm an amateur  writer and I'm seeking a bit of advice. I don't plan on being published or writing for anyone else; I just write for my own pleasure and to express myself and I share my work without asking for anything in return except maybe some constructive criticism. I'm not looking for any sort of external gratification. I simply seek a creative outlet

I need advice in organizing my story. I have too many ideas and it is frustrating and overwhelming, premature and stupid. I often tell people I wish to write a vast epic tale. Naturally, the first question they ask is ""What's it about."" I feel crazy and foolish when my response is ""I have no idea."" ""Well, how...wait, what?! You don't have a story, then!"" They respond. And to a considerable extent, I agree. I want to change that. 

I know the theme, but there's just so much material.

TL;DR - How do I organize the swimming cacophony of ideas in my head into something coherent? How do I find a starting point?

But I also get conflicting reports on what things I ""know"" are appropriate to write about.

My last writing group (whom I adored) were very adamant about not having writer characters. No one wants to read about writers, they aren't. Even when Stephen King has a writer character, he tortures and abuses them physically and mentally (Jack Torrance of *The Shining*, Paul Sheldon of *Misery*, Mike Noonan of *Bag of Bones*).

Okay,"" I can't write about it.

So what do people mean when they says ""Write what you know""? I don't think we are absolutely limited to only writing about our lives; our gender, age group, hair color, etc. I think we can write from any perspective we can imagine, so long as the characters are fleshed out enough to act believably. 

Maybe it's about writing from what you ""know"" emotionally. What you've experienced in your life. Those human truths that makes fiction, which was translated from Portuguese, I think. It is about a young woman, with a decent job, life, boyfriend, who doesn't want to live any longer. She takes a bunch of pills, but it was not. She doesn't die

Now, sure, but I know enough shallow people that I can buy that. I can feel her story deep in my psyche, gut, where ever it is a powerful story touches me. 

But, because of his desire to write instead of whatever jobs boring people choose, his parents had him institutionalized. He *knew* what things were like inside a mental institution. He *knew* what it felt like to be thought or to feel crazy. He *knew* what desolation, despair, and abandonment felt like. So, sure, he didn't write about a young man whose parents didn't understand him, and built a new story out of it.

I'm trying to move away from always writing about bakers or cooks, traveling, carnivals, concerts, foods, parties, etc.). And every time I try a new thing, always thinking

Thinking about it...after 28 years...I wonder just how present I am in most of my experiences. Most of the time I know I'm thinking,False,,t5_2u32d,False,tag-discussion,,t3_13wso0

I started to write down descriptions of interesting people that I would see out and about. I would write down the things that they would say or do, I've found that the description of a person isn't really the meat and potatoes of the story anyway. It's merely for use in the imagination of the reader. There are stories wherein the author barely describes any of the characters at all. In describing characters I have effectively distanced myself from the hardest part of writing for me, and allowing myself to remain objective throughout the writing process.

Here's an example of a character that I took down on a trip away for Labor Day:

&gt;Portly cover band frontman with a potbellied Jack Daniels shirt singing Bruce Springsteen's Dancing in the Dark at a Geneva on the Lake bar. Heart with a knife tattoo on one side and crappy superman tattoo on the other.

This may conjure up mental images for you or it may not, whether I use the characters or not, it still helps complete my ""literary toolbox"" if you will. Coming up with clever and detailed descriptions start to come easier and characters begin to seem more fleshed out and realistic.

I also like to use random street signs that I pass as last names

*Balfour

*Platte

...really? Nobody? Huh.

For the rest of us, I can get distracted way too easily and end up spending precious hours yelling at people about not being productive on a certain web site (ironic, I know).

To combat this

The concept of it is simple. You break your work into bite-sized chunks and take a small break between those chunks. You do this by having a timer (some will suggest a kitchen timer, 10 minutes, and focus only on your task during that period of time. After the 10 minutes is up, take a 2 minute break to do whatever. After the 2 minutes, it's back to work. Repeat, repeat, repeat.

It may sound dumb, it works wonders. I did 4 dashes last night at the end of the day and ended up with 1,400 words by the end of it, not feeling stressed about it for a second.

Maybe it taps into some latent undiagnosed ADD I have, it becomes easier to manage. Fun even. As I gain momentum, I sometimes even find myself not caring about the breaks anymore, which is the true goal of using the technique.",Productivity,False,,False,t3_try8m

There are one or two I've run into in the editing process, they aren't added on a knee-jerk (like the accursed 'quickly' usually is), and to create the implication necessary for them to be irrelevant seems like it would take more effort than the verb itself is actually worth in the overall context of the story.

I'm talking here about words like the 'usually' and 'dutifully' I used above. 'Usually' seems like it earns its place in its sentence because it describes the frequency of the action I was referring to

1374588397.0,1ivum0,Let's Be Bad Guys: Realistic Antagonism,danceswithronin,11,5,4,"One of the biggest problems I have with books is when they turn their antagonist (or ""bad guy"", ""I just put that scene in there to show what a bad guy my bad guy is."" 

Guys

There are three levels of antagonism that should be present in a novel for it to reach its highest potential for conflict and suspense:

- Protagonist against self: Aka, engagingly heroic, but we also need them to have weaknesses that make them realistic human beings (or cat-people...or androids...whatever). To do this, you have to draw on your character's background and exploit it against him. Is your character spiritual? Test his faith. Is he afraid of fire? Throw a baby in a burning building, and make him choose between facing his fear and saving an innocent. Is he afraid of space (Bones)? Put his ass in space anyway - make him an astronaut against the odds. It is only when characters are forced to come up against their worst attributes, that they are forced to shine a flashlight into the darkness inside themselves, that they can dispel that darkness and become bigger, a generally kind man may discover a streak of cruelty, and then to overcome them. Courage is not the lack of fear

- Protagonist against environment: This can be society (such as in the novel *1984*) or it can be the literal environment, you've got to set the world against him. Murphy's Law all over the damned place. If your hero needs it to work, break it. If he needs a piece of information, make him work for it. Constantly throw wrenches in the plot. This is your rising action. Test your hero's ingenuity and ability to deal with change and disappointment. 

- Protagonist against the other: Here's your big bad. Not all heroes will have a clearly defined antagonist (some will play their own antagonist

Here's a few:

* Vulnerability: Your bad guy *must* have an Achilles heel, nobody likes somebody who is perfect. It's annoying. Whether it's your hero or your bad guy.

* Perspective: In his/her own mind, everybody thinks they have a perfectly good reason for doing what they do. So in order to convey your villain as a real person, you must show a softer side to them. Give them very real reasons for their actions, even if those reasons are ultimately irrational or driven by some kind of mental illness (sociopathy, narcissism, etc...). If you do this, your villain will be better. [Gray morality] (http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGrayMorality) is your friend.

* Reason: Do not have your villain act the villain for no fucking reason. See my second point - everyone must act for a very specific purpose, not them! Also, like with your protagonist, it is best if the actions depicted by your villain actually move the plot forward in some way, or give the reader new and interesting information about the world you've created. 

Okay

* What other qualifications do you think foster realism in a bad guy?

* Who is your favorite bad guy in fiction

* Give us some examples of realistic antagonism in your own writing.

* Do you think a realistic antagonist is as important to a story as a likeable protagonist? Why or why not? Should your readers love your villain as much as your hero?

Additionally, Authors will reference fictional characters from other books. In a story in which a good deal of plot or event is based off of reference, even if it is very obscure, (think a story like Cornelia Funke's Inkheart, or even Ray Bradbury's Farenheit 451), to what extent does one have to go out and seek permission of the original author/publisher/owner to use those references? Does this vary depending on reference? Does this change if your tale alters the universe of the other tale?

While my heart says ""Do whatever you want, the fictional universe of your story can be similar to our universe in that they have the same products or other histories or fictions, your tale is fictional and you don't need to pay a royalty to create art.""

The next day you may think it is genius in text form or maybe has become a complete wash. Something important I think I'm coming to understand about writing is that you shouldn't put preconceived limitations or goals for yourself. Chicken or the egg - the writer or his genre? Whatever you write gets written and nobody should tell you otherwise, especially not you.

I was writing a story a couple of weeks ago, I was madly in love with the idea. The premise was this: a boring man who does all his living in his thoughts gets mugged. The two strangers get to know each other as people, but even after all the talk, our protagonist is forced into stabbing the mugger in self-defense. He breaks down in tears at how very wrong he was in thinking this would have prestige, dignity. Throw in a dash of dialogue and other literary stuff, and bam. One short story ready for the world.

I still like the idea. Unfortunately, looked at the incoherent rambling that had been dribbling out the past couple of pages, and deleted the whole mess on the spot. The story just wasn't flowing out like I thought it was supposed to. It sounded brilliant to me when I played it in my head, but in the end, impotent.

Disheartened, I found myself joining a word war. I had no idea what to write about and certainly did not have anything on my mind in preparation. The war was about to begin and I needed something so I just went with [the daily prompt](http://www.reddit.com/r/thedailyprompt/comments/130ef2/the_daily_prompt_for_11_november_2012_when/), saying to myself, ""today will be a nice little excercise.""

At first glance, I had written just over 500 words. Seeing as how I'm quite the novice to this more serious approach to writing, I was pleasantly suprised. all things considered. More than just the word count though, something else was special about this. Writing it was fun. If you ever find yourself having fun writing, even if you may think this fun is producing unintelligble garbage no one will ever read, it is still worth it. Worth it for more than just the ""happy after-school special"" reason of ""as long as you're having fun, that's what really counts!"" No, you are practicing writing the types of things you may end up writing about for quite a long time.

I don't know what type of writer I am, I'll settle with being just some guy writing about a cybernetic being who has been reconsctructed in the future and finds himself at the whims of an anti-cybernetics terrorist sect. That suits me just fine for now.

Anyway! If you're interested come check it out [in IRC](/r/shutupandwrite/wiki/irc). Here's a list of the commands.

`!status` tells you if there is a wordsprint currently going on in the channel and

`!sprint` starts a wordsprint. By default, or `!sprint 15 2` for a 15-minute sprint starting in 2 minutes.

`!join` joins a wordsprint already in progress.

`!leave` leaves a wordsprint.

`!close` ends a wordsprint early

`!wordcount NNN` or `!wc NNN` (where `NNN` is a number) tells the bot your current wordcount. If you run this command before the sprint starts, it assumes your starting wordcount is 0 and sets your count accordingly. If you've joined late and are not starting from 0, use `!wc reset NNN` to set your starting wordcount anytime.

`!wc add NNN` where `NNN` is a number of words adds that number of words to your wordcount. If the sprint has not started yet

`!wc reset NNN` where `NNN` is a number of words sets your wordcount to 0 and sets your starting wordcount to `NNN`.

`!final` tells the bot you're finished and not to wait up for you to update your wordcount one last time at the end of the sprint.

Please give your feedback either here or to awkisopen in IRC. This is an experimental way of running wordsprints and your thoughts/feelings/complaints are appreciated!",,t5_2u32d,False,tag-productivity,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/shutupandwrite/comments/1kd0m5/wordsprints_are_back_and_available_for_testing/

But what constitutes a setting? Most people answer with ‘the time and place a story takes place in’. So one answer could be Victorian Paris. Another could be in an arm of a distant galaxy. But the place isn’t the only thing that creates the setting. The general populace creates it too

Which is the problem

What is your central conflict?

Ask yourself that every time you start a scene. The central conflict IS the hatred between the insectoid Klicklaks and the hated avian Flutters? Then how does that play out? If your piece sounds like a history lesson given by Ben Stein, and for that action to mean something, it must be opposed (Newton’s laws are even applicable to writing! Who knew!). Who is the opposing force? Ideas are not opposing forces! Ideas create the opposing forces, getting into the minds and guiding the actions of the antagonists. Your character may hate the concept of wanton abuse of natural resources, but without someone to struggle against, what makes him any different than a blogger sitting on a recliner sipping tea while they type out a scathing rebuke on their iPad? And that rebuke is nothing more than setting- creating the environment in which the conflict exists (Here is the situation, and here is the counter argument against it). It’s this small difference that causes confusion

Be aware of your characters, it’s story. If it’s the reason behind the situation that prompts the action, it’s setting. Keep your work focused on story. While actions require setting to have meaning, setting itself is not the story.

1364906120.0,1bif1j,Discovery Writing v Outlines – Have an End in Mind,jacklusted,2,2,0,"From my website:

As I dive into my revised outline before I assault the mountain that is the second draft I thought I’d write about my thoughts on a subject that gets debated a lot online

These can be viewed as two extremes of a spectrum. Plotting is all about having a firm outline before you start writing and mostly sticking to it as you know where it is going. Pantsing is all about having an idea and discovering the plot as you go

Very few writers will sit firmly in one camp or another, and I’m flexible about making more changes as I go along so I have elements of the pantsing side in my approach.

If you are writing a series (and my books are now looking to be a series of four rather than a trilogy) I feel some outlining will always be necessary to plot out the overall story-arcs and make sure it is all consistent.

For me this discussion about how you approach writing a book will always come down to what works best for each individual writer. Whatever works best for you is what matters. More important to me is something that can be applied to both approaches.

**Have an ending in mind**

This to me is crucial whether you outline or use the discovery method, you know your book needs to end up there.

It doesn’t matter if it all changes in the next draft, just have a vague flag off in the distance you can work towards.

Or maybe you're not happy with that identity
The point is

I have a passage from Ecce Homo (Friedrich Nietzsche) for you.


""Has anyone at the end of the nineteenth century any distinct notion of what poets of a stronger age understood by the word inspiration?  If not, becoming suddenly visible and audible with indescribable certainty and accuracy—is a simple description.  You hear—you do not seek; you take—and do not ask who gives: a thought suddenly flashes up like lightning, it comes as a necessity, without hesitation—I have never had any choice in the matter.  There is an ecstasy so great that the immense strain of it is sometimes relaxed by a flood of tears during which one does not know whether one is coming or going.  There is the feeling of completely being outside of oneself, with the very distinct consciousness of endless delicate shivers right down to one’s toes;—there is a depth of happiness in which the most painful and gloomy parts do not detract from the whole but are produced and required as necessary shades of colour amidst such an overflow of light.  There is an instinct for rhythmical relationships which embrace a whole world of forms: length, the need of an all-embracing rhythm, is almost the measure of the force of inspiration, the truest and simplest means of expression.  It actually seems, here would all Becoming learn of you how to speak”.)  This is my experience of inspiration.  I do not doubt but that I should have to go back thousands of years before I could find another who could say to me: ""It is mine also”!  ",t5_2u32d
