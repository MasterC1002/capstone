1349125295.0,10s3lo,I now own an old Gibson banjo. Could you help me understand what exactly I have here?,lumpofclay,27,1,26,"OK

Back story: my dad started learning banjo about 20 years ago, it was mine now and to take good care of it. Yay, jackpot! Unfortunately I couldn't string it, because one of the tuning pegs didn't work and immediately lost tension when tightened. So I had to find an instrument shop to repair it and do general checkup. I got it back yesterday and can finally start actually playing it.

I don't know very much about this banjo (or banjos in general)

*Manufacturer: Gibson*

*Model: Bella Voce (TB 3)*

*Year of construction: 1925
 
*Hardware:*

- *gold
- *two piece flange*
- *Presto tailpiece*
- *high profile flathead tonering*

*Wood:*

- *curly maple
- *Bella Voce pearl inlays*

*Some wood carving

Here's an [album](http://imgur.com/a/NuBaq) for you to take a look. Also [here's a video of me trying my first song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyouDIzOayE) to give you an idea of the sound. I have many years of guitar experience but only 2 days of banjo so don't expect wonders
 
I know as much as this is a damn fine banjo and now probably the most valuable single thing in my home but I am confused about the history of the instrument. From what I have researched it seems that Gibson did not build Bella Voce models as early as 1925, painting and inlays are original and which were added or modified by Bob Flesher. He seems to be a very accomplished banjo builder, at least the banjos on his website look fantastic, so I guess he knows what he's doing. To my untrained eye the banjo seems to be in pretty good shape considering the age. What do you think such a banjo could be worth?

**TL;DR: Got my dad's Gibson Bella Voce. [Here's some photos](http://imgur.com/a/NuBaq). [Here's a video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyouDIzOayE&amp;hd=1). Don't know much about banjos

* Song of The Week (SOTW) will be posted on the Monday of every week.
* I will try to organize who will pick the song for next week. EVERYONE WHO WANTS TO PICK A SONG just message me and i'll get something going.
* This is supposed to be a fun and supportive place for ALL of us (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced) players to collectively learn a song. Try to provide help to one another
* FORM: Form of the post

Now that administrative stuff is out of the way. Lets get picking!

NOTE: I have played banjo for over 25 years. I have worked in a music shop. I teach. I have also owned a variety of different banjos

Firstly, Aria and, of course, Kasuga banjos and multiple other brand names. Sam Ick (Samick) and Cort were other manufacturer out of Korea, now the Samick brand was sold to a company in China after going bankrupt and Cort is out of Indonesia, I believe. There is no difference between the brands except the name, but each company makes various levels, but set up can play a huge role. The head may be tighter, heads should be adjusted

Banjo type 1:
[The bracket and shoe banjo](http://i.imgur.com/zyCCh.jpg). These banjos have what is known as a ""shoe bracket"" or ""bracket and shoe"" system to attach the head of the banjo to the rim. The ""shoe"" attaches directly to a multi-ply wood rim. The hook bolt holds the rim, they shear. The tuners are like guitar tuners (sticking out from the headstock) and they are open back. This is the ultimate beginner banjo. In a store, they are sold for around $250 new, and come with the typical beginner package (soft case, book, tuner, picks). I wouldn't be able to come up with all the names, Saga, it will be easier to sell once you ""outgrow"" it). They have a very woody sound with little sustain

Banjo type 2:
[The bottle-cap banjo](http://imgur.com/3RH8Y). These banjos, and so is the rim. The hooks tend to be thin, so the same problem can occur with shearing. The tuners can either be like guitar tuners, but some of the higher ends have banjo-type tuners (not sticking out to the side of the headstock, but directly behind, like the image I posted). These banjos have multiple names as well, and they span back into the 80s. If you notice, but can be found in the $200 range. In my opinion

Banjo type 3:
[No tone ring, then through the flange). The rim is a made of wood, and there is typically a rolled-brass hoop between the head of the banjo (but not always, sometimes it sits directly on the wood). These almost always have banjo-style tuners. Take the resonator off these banjos as the rim can be either multi-ply (sometimes up to 12 plys of veneer) or three-ply (they actually look like 5-ply, because they use a wood-shim between the plys). The 3-ply banjos are of a higher quality. These are in the $500 to $600 range. Those with a multi-ply rim can sometimes be found for cheaper. These have a woodier sound than banjos with a true tone ring, but they sound a lot louder than the previous banjos I talked about, and are a true intermediate banjo. Set up, as mentioned they can be as old as the 1930s and up. Some of the 1930s ones can be, RK25) is the one that I would suggest. It is three-ply rim and put together well. These banjos can be American made

Banjo type 4:
[tone ring, a one-piece flange (the bolts don't go through a ""tube"" before going through the flange) and it has a tone ring. That is brass ring that sits on top of the wood rim, and the head of the banjo sits on the brass ring. The particular banjo has an ""arch top"". Banjos such as this can also have the two-piece (tube and plate) flange. These banjos tend to start at $700. They may be found cheaper (some of the 70s banjos, such as Aida and Ibanez, can be found cheaper if you're patient). Again, the rims can be mutli-ply or 3-ply. Always take the resonator off and check. The three-ply tends to sound better. This is the entry into the upper-intermediate banjo. Properly set up, this banjo will last you a long time. They tend to be heavier due to the tone ring. The ""arch top"" banjo will tend to have a brighter, but that can largely depend on set-up.

SPECIAL MENTION: 
[The Deering ""Goodtime 2"" banjo](http://imgur.com/0VlRi). All right. I may get some hate here. This is the banjo that gets mentioned a lot in this subreddit. This is an okay banjo. They fall in the $500 range. The main issue that I have with this banjo is the width of the rim (which is the metal rim that surrounds the drum head of the banjo). It is very thin. And the hooks are thin as well. I also don't think, they're a good banjo. But, in my opinion, for an extra $100, you can get a better banjo.

There. That's your intro into banjo. If you want,000 banjo... though I think if you're at that level, you don't need my opinion. Also, please feel free to correct some of the information. I'm sorry if I've offended anybody with my opinion. My main goal is to provide price ranges, so when people stumble onto a banjo, they can have some idea whether they are getting a deal or not. And I truly hope this helps this community.


TOP TIPS ON IMPROVING YOUR SOUND BEFORE SPENDING MONEY ON THE UPGRADE:

Most of these entry level banjos (including the Goodtime) have pretty awful tuners out of the box. Upgrading to a nice set of brand name planetary geared tuners will run you about $110. They are pretty simple to install and you can even switch back when you move up. [These Schaller tuners are pretty nice:](http://www.elderly.com/accessories/names/schaller-planet-pegs-%28set-of-4%29--BP4.htm)

Even on expensive banjos, they come in multiple heights, so make sure you get the right one for your banjo. If you don't have a place near you, [buy a couple different bridges with multiple heights here](http://www.stewmac.com/shop/Bridges,_tailpieces/Banjo_bridges/5-String_Banjo_Bridges.html) - if you buy 12, they are only $2.25 each. Once you figure out the height you want for your banjo, [you may want to check out the higher-priced bridges](http://www.banjoteacher.com/Gear/Banjo%20Bridge/index.htm). They run about $25.00. I'm a fan of Scorpion Banjo Bridges by Silvio Ferretti. Silvio is a heck of a great guy - a great banjo player from Italy.

A good banjo tailpiece can make your live easier, keeping the bridge in place as well as increasing overall volume. The sharper the angle on the tailpiece, the ""sharper"" the sound. It's a matter of personal preference. Cheap tailpieces can't be adjusted. [The Presto tailpiece is the Gibson standard. Some people like the Waverly, and some people like the Kershner](http://www.stewmac.com/shop/Bridges,_tailpieces/Banjo_tailpieces.html). They're under $35.00, and tend to be around $25.00. [These ones are funky](http://elderly.com/accessories/items/BA77.htm). [Or if you want to get real fancy, Fults makes some very nice tailpieces](http://www.banjotailpiece.com/)

[Intro to banjo - right hand](http://youtu.be/TOLwxcJP1B0)

If you have any questions about the lesson

Some notes. Practice these two rolls until you can comfortably do them one after another. Alternate between doing an alternating thumb and a forward backward roll (and vice versa). It is important to get that right-hand movement into muscle memory - it will help when you have to look at hand positioning of your left hand (the next lesson).

(EDIT) All right

I would be happy to organize the song of the week. Those interesting in participating, I'll choose a song, if that's okay with everyone.

With all that said

Another edit. I believe someone was asking if we could include a brief history of the song. I'll do my best, popular in the southern states. I believe the first reference to it is in an 1899 fiddle contest (it was one of the tunes required) in Gallatin Texas. The first recording is by Texas fiddler Eck Robertson in 1922. It didn't gain widespread popularity until Arthur ""Fiddlin"" Smith played it regularly on the Grande Ol' Opry in the 30s and 40s. This song was also played regularly by Doc Watson. This song is also the first song on the track ""Fiddle Tunes for Banjo"" by Tony Trishka, Bela Fleck and Bill Keith. All three of them play this song on the track.

I have only been playing banjo since the last week of December, thats when the thimble really stood out.  Gave the banjo a louder, deeper, metal-y tone.  The tip of the thimble is curved, so with some force, the strings really slide and snap off the thimble when you come directly at the head of the banjo. I found myself able to hit the strings harder, and get a clearer sound (when I did it right).  Without it, mostly due to my lack of experience)
  
I think with practice with it

Joe ran a store and had a licensed still, which made him rather popular in the area. The still and his life also made him be a pretty rough individual.

Joe Clark had recently divorced and was running around with several women around town, to kill Joe Clark so she could lay claim to Joe's farm and general store. Howard shot Joe in April of 1885.

History: This song was originally a hymn by Ada R. Habershon and Charles Gabriel. Originally

A.P. Carter changed the verses but kept the chorus (and changed the song title to ""Can the Circle Be Unbroken."") To list all the different artists who have covered this song (or portions of the song

But I would be remiss to not include the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. In 1972, who refused to participate. But Earl Scruggs, Roy Acuff, Maybelle Carter, Vassar Clements, Merle Travis, Jimmy Martin, they also kept the tape of discussions of how the songs would be played

Originally, in my opinion, none can compare to the original 1972 recordings.

After Jackson was president and time had passed, not the man. This is a unique older fiddle tune as it seems to have no ties to a modified European fiddle tune.

I'm a left-handed musician, but that lefties were special orders only and usually not made for entry-level instruments. In spite of this, he promised me he'd check with his sales rep if anything could be done. To my surprise, he called me back soon enough to let me know Deering agreed to make me a nice open back lefty right in my price range (500$). I was ecstatic.

Since I wasn't familiar with the model proposed (Goodtime), I dropped by a music shop which I knew carried banjos, mainly to check out the difference between an open back and a closed back banjo (in my dreams, mine had always been a closed back). As soon as I saw the banjo section, I was sad to realize they didn't have any open backs at the moment.

But then my jaw dropped to the floor. Right there, which totally bust my budget, but was completely worth the value.

There is a slight difference between the two. Typically, they tend to get morphed into one another.

Origins of the tune is sketchy. Lost Indian is likely derived from Lonesome Indian. Tommy Magness recorded Lost Indian around the 1930s. The song may predate that

Cherokee Shuffle is also considered a ""crooked tune"" as the A part and the B part are not the same length.

The other problem is that I am not sure I can get a drum shell thick/sturdy enough to hold the tension.

Perhaps a steel rod that goes through the drum shell and is bolted into the neck?

I have a tenor banjo with no brand name on the head stock, if anything. Is there a way I can tell what it is? What I can tell you is that it has a pie-plate style resonator that comes off completely when I remove a center bolt that screws right through the center of the resonator and into the truss-rod. It leaves the banjo looking like a traditional open-back (no awkward flanges hanging out everywhere). Another way of putting it, the bow-tie style flange is part of the resonator unit, not a part of the head and pot. The tuners are new (originals were black friction tuners). Was told it could be a Vega, or a Kay Co/Stromberg-Voisinet. 

Does anyone here know any diagnostic features to whittle it down?

My plan is to drill the holes for the dots just slightly too shallow, probably with superglue, and then sand the whole neck down to a nice finish.

The dance [""cakewalk""](http://youtu.be/AcFQjG3TiBw) is also clouded in its origins. I like the version that it was a parody of the ballroom dances that slaves would have seen as servers. It became a popular dance style in the very early 1900s. At town fairs
