1332794111.0,req2c,"If you have a question that is something along the lines of ""How do I game my friend?"" then read this.",ARealSocialIdiot,91,11,27,"There are a lot of people coming into AskSeddit lately with questions very much like this:

* How do I get out of the friend zone?
* Is there a way I can get my friend to become a FWB?
* How do I escalate with a friend of mine?

Et cetera.

Here comes the bad part: Don't even try. Just don't. It's a bad idea and you will almost definitely end up hurting yourself or her in the process.

Here's the thing: This whole concept of ""I want to change her mind about me""? That isn't how pickup works. You need to understand one of the basic tenets of seduction

What you're dealing with in these situations is a simple case of [oneitis](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/pbkxs/glossary_of_terms_hz/)

People are lazy. As a pickup artist, if you're trying to get with a girl who already knows you and considers you a friend, the amount of effort to get her to think of you first as a sexual object and then as one she's actually interested in being with is FAR too much.

You know what you should be doing instead? **Go out and find NEW girls.** Forget about the ones you're already friends with. It's way more trouble than it's worth

I know that AskSeddit is a place for newbies, and it would be unfair to you if we didn't tell you that up front.

My general advice for newbies?

1. Go to [/r/seduction](/r/seduction) and read as much of the content in the sidebar as you can. Learn the basics
2. Forget about the women that are already in your life. And I mean *forget* about them. The odds are overwhelmingly that you will never sleep with them if you haven't by now. If you're keeping them around because you're in the friend zone and you hope that someday they'll let you out of it
3. Go out and meet as many new women as you can. I know there are a lot of younger guys in this subreddit

The answer in the first case could be: ""Wow, but that's as far as I planned ahead. Shit.""

I called this ""embrace the truth""

Embarrassment, self-consciousness... these are INTRINSIC HUMAN EMOTIONS. If you do not have them, you are a sociopath. If someone tells you they don't have them, they are almost certainly a liar, and if not, they are almost certainly a sociopath themselves.

You've heard it in all the war movies, ""bravery is about what you do when you're scared, not when you don't have any fear.""

The difference between a man who can successfully ""not give a fuck"" and one who lives in fear of approaching women is that the latter guy isn't just embarrassed or afraid... he is embarrassed and afraid to be embarrassed and afraid. ""Not giving a fuck"" is about recognizing and accepting how ridiculous you are; that you're this goofy creature who does stupid things.

Those asshole PUAs with their greasy slicked back hair, but they've learned to hide it.

Those great guys who everybody likes, or running out of things to say, or stammering and being a goof is a perfectly natural thing to happen.

Being ""alpha"" is about accepting this kind of stuff happens, everyone else walking around - ladies man or lady - is just as much a bizarrely evolved super-ape as you are. In their heads, the same shit is going on to a lesser or greater extent.

In order to successfully ""not give a fuck"", that makes them the fool, not you.

4.  Women love to talk about two things above all others:  Relationships and the unknown.

6.  Demonstrate preselection by other women, a willingness to walk away, proper emotes, and that you are a successful risk-taker, and you embody what she subconsciously desires.


7.  All communications are either IOI’s or IOD’s.


8.  Never tell a woman that you love her


9.  Always leave a woman wondering where she stands.


10.  Women will backwards rationalize everything unless you keep them in the moment.


11.  Spend no money on a woman until after you have had her.


12.  Treat a queen like a whore and a whore like a queen.

15.  If you do not go out


16.  BS babbles brains.


17.  Assume Attraction


18.  Kino


You –


My body language is slow and deliberate.  I move less than anyone else around me.  I always lean back and take up space.  I mimic her motions
I could care less.  I throw comments and go, and I do not care what the woman thinks.  Everything is no big deal.  My voice is deep, loud and slow.  I redirect questions onto her for details, and I do not interrupt her answers.  I remain silent until I get the answer I want.  I count to three, touch her and speak.  I make eye contact, smile and use her name constantly.  I never multitask.  I screen her with statement questions, and never use more than three in a row.  I force her investment of money, not the observer.  I am comfortable, by smiling and changing topics.  When she touches me, slap it
“Pleasure meeting you”


Her –


If she tests you, while I playfully push her away.  Her shields exist because sympathy and generosity turn to neutrality, then hostility.

This girl was very stereotypical, a girl like this is this interested in me? i should be chatting with her."" Mistake #1.

End up meeting this past Saturday night with my friend and her gay travel partner. We all chat for a while and then head to a bar. As soon as we get to the bar, etc. He asks before he does it if I'm cool with it, and I'm like nah dude that's not cool. He continues regardless and she starts becoming receptive to it. They make out. She starts sitting on his lap. At this point I'm thinking haha how is this happening, fuck this, and just start looking occupied to kill the awkwardness.

I stopped talking to them completely as it became very awkward and I felt like both of them were doing me wrong. When my other buddy arrived to the bar

What ticks me off a bit is how I've heard the douchebag friend has handled the situation with me to her. Apparently he has been framing it to make it seem like I was in love with her, but it makes me cringe to know that she now thinks I was in love with her.

I’m assuming the conversation is between TWO people. With that assumption its important to realize that IT IS BETWEEN TWO PEOPLE

Alright, are you looking for something?” or an indirect question which is actually a statement “That is a mighty fine tramp stamp you have there my lady” meant to have them go off about their “so they don’t forget my name when I’m getting banged” tattoo idea.

The best way to continue a conversation is to actually pay attention to them when they speak. Lets assume she starts talking about her backpacking trip, tigers or bears? Ever get an urge to punt a bunny? Things like that. Basically if someone is speaking about something, you want to try to replicate the experience in your own mind, and the best way for the experiences to sync up is to ask them questions. 

When you ask them questions you seem interested in them. They feel important and happy when someone views them as interesting. We all want to be found interesting; we all want to capture the hearts and minds of people around us. Give them that feeling and they will love you forever.

What, who, why. Use them like a cheap personal whore – often. Remember some important things: Men like to explain and teach, men basically want the world to think their way. Women like to empathize and talk about emotions, women basically want the world to feel their way. Golden rule for when talking to a female; give that bitch some emotions, bitches love emotions.

Remember how I said its between TWO people? Yeah that’s where you come in. You have to reciprocate the conversation in someway. It seriously helps if you have done interesting things. If you haven’t

If she mentions her backpacking trip, ask her what she wanted to do when she was little, or why she chose this instead. If she talks about shoes, change the fucking subject.

**background**

There's an asian restaurant in NYC that I frequent where a really cute waitress works (I am also asian btw). Last summer (2012) I went with a friend and while we were eating lunch she and I kept making eye contact. I kept ordering pineapple juice for some reason. Anyway

It was on a total whim: months passed and I assumed she thought I was weird or too forward so I let it go. To my complete and utter surprise, pineapple juice""!! It took me a while to figure out who was texting me, but she said that she thought she'd lost the napkin with my number on it and just found it again. She told me all her co-workers at the restaurant also read it (-_-) and I figured I had nothing to lose so I asked her to get drinks next weekend. She responded ""u r cute"" and now we've agreed to meet next sunday when she doesn't have work!

**3 Questions:**

* Do I take her to coffee on sunday like I said in my note or drinks?
* She seems to be a foreigner who can speaks english well enough
* I've NEVER approached girls in this manner before - I'm graduating from college this spring and until now have only approached girls I knew from university. I'd appreciate tips on how to handle the situation I've set myself up for.

On one hand, like ""did you see the fight outside,"" etc.  And those same people swear that you can't go up to a girl and just say ""Hey, I'm so-and-so, what's your story?"" because it expresses interest up front, and that might shut her down.

You can meet people while you are ordering breakfast/lunch/dinner at the deli

You can meet people on the bus, at a concert, in the park, at the gym, *in your car with the windows down at a stoplight!* The point is, **you have to meet them, and introduce them to you.** And you can't really do that sitting in your room on the computer.

Under 21?  Then most likely you are still in school.  Join clubs, have them bring their friends, call a house party.  Make it so eventually you are the one people are looking to to have fun.  Go to an arcade, go karts pick up an instrument, already play? Start a band! (Every band needs a bass/drummer, they are often hard to come by).  Does your school have a ""Home movies"" type club? Maybe maybe not, but that can be fun, and get you to meet interesting people you never thought you would. 

Go to a cooking class, you'll most likely feel more relaxed and can psych each other up.  Point is, you just have to do things you a) Enjoy b) maybe a little out of your comfort zone.

So last night I was out with a meetup group at a bar, and we spoke for quite a while with no signs of flagging interest.

A couple of her girlfriends came by some time before the meetup was over, so I just said something about seeing her again at the next meetup in a couple of weeks and left. Later I thought man, I could have at least asked for her phone number, jeez! I guess that would have not been inappropriate, right? Or is it okay to just wait until the next meetup and see if she's still interested? I guess my question is, what should I expect that she would have been expecting me to do?

Here's another one - this evening I went to get a haircut at the local ""hip"" barbershop. As I walked over to sit in the waiting area, early 30s, who was just finishing up on another guy's hair, and naturally was hoping I'd get her for mine. Didn't happen, and I was assigned another stylist to get my hair cut. At that point in the cut where the stylist spins you around to look at the back of your head, the other stylist was looking at me from across the room and flashed me a smile, which I reciprocated.

At this barbershop, feeling all relaxed and I look up, and the other stylist is sitting in her chair looking at me again, big smile this time. 

Obviously, what to do about that? Should I have suavely approached her and asked for her number? I mean, is that cool in someone's place of work? Of course, if all this is happening in her place of work, I guess that's really the only place where something like asking for her number could happen. But again I ask, what should I expect that she would have been expecting me to do?

At my age there's always the thought that someone that young may merely think I'm a cute older man who reminds her of her father, time to stop.

We take a few shots, I lead all 3 girls out to the dance floor, and start dancing with them. I escalate a little kino with M, but was joking around with them all. I motioned to E that she should hop on the counter and start dancing, and she says yea, grabs my hand and moves me over to the counter with her. I flirt with her a bit, then help her up. I go back to the other 2 girls

At one point, told her I needed someone to dance with and helped her down.

We start dancing together, I'm having fun dancing with her, so I keep to it. After a while, she turns around and tells me:
""So my bf is in a frat and I know he cheats on me all the time. We have a sort of open relationship

I tell her I have a few beers next door, I'm joking with her, and I thought it was going well. She thought it was my room but I told her the truth. A couple times she looks at me and smiles and says ""Idk about you, Bansheethief."" 

Another thing she asked me was how many partners I've been with. I think I messed up here and told her the truth, and I didn't act confident and started saying different numbers, or that I was joking. Again ""Idk about you, Bansheethief."" 

A little more joking, they've been together for 3 years. He was her first and only sexual partner. She is only with him because he has money and he doesn't really appreciate her. She says they have their own social lives and don't really talk about if they hooked up with anyone else. 

We show up at her apartment, and didn't escalate sexually with her. We talked about music, she showed me some Irish dance moves, etc. At one point, we started watching a movie on her couch, and I had her arm around her. I went into kiss her, and she said the more she sobers up, and eventually we make our way into her bed. We are laying in bed watching a TV show and she says it is making her tired. I start trying to kiss her and she stops me and says 

* ""I'm too nice.""

* ""I'm not like most guys
* ""I remind her too much of her ex."" 
* ""I should go home."" 
* ""She thinks I'm a great guy and it is nothing wrong with me
* She said she doesn't really hook up with guys like that. And she likes to get to know them first.
* She thought it was weird how we met each other through M. And she feels bad about hooking up with me.


I go to the bathroom, so I kept asking her what I did or said wrong and if I could just stay on the couch. I'll admit, I didn't handle getting kicked out the best, I kinda acted like an AFC, but you learn.

So in order to learn

As a result of this

On Monday, and then chatted with the waitress until my date arrived.

It started very awkwardly. I stood up to go for a hug or a handshake, which added to the physical/spacial confusion.) Eventually we got seated, got our beers, and got the conversations going. Her body language continued to be very standoffish, she was keeping about six inches between us on the bench, and was showing no IOIs whatsoever. The conversation was very good, though, three beers, but she was really into the music

When I stopped the car in front of her building, ""We're blocking the street,"" and kissed her again. Then: ""Can I come up and meet [her cat]?"" She assented. After a quick tour, we ended up cuddling on the couch watching tv, and . . . to continue would be too explicit for seddit :)

We're going out again soon.

&gt; In the meantime


-- Mystery


Once upon a time, ""I need a woman"". It was impossible to be any more of an AFC.

So I went cold turkey

Or not. I gradually relapsed and struggled with addiction, came across Mystery's quote, and had an epiphany. If you want to stop being a wanker, gain confidence, and improve your quality of life, you must do two things:

1. Connect with people.
2. Develop Inner Game. 

So I'm in this game for those two things. I don't want to kiss women, necessarily. Well, maybe I do, deep down. But I'm married, and I'm a man of principles, so I won't.

I just want the self improvement: to fix my marriage, and increase my alpha male behaviour and body language. Did I mention I want to gain confidence? I want to ooze it. O-O-Z-E. On demand. Around women. Around AMOGs. In job interviews. Everywhere.

(The only exception I take with Mystery is to never jerk off

So I'm currently reading The Game and watching PU material on YouTube. I've also watched Season 2 of the Pickup Artist, and the rejections were highly cringeworthy. I found them difficult to watch because they reflect my own failures with women and my fear of rejection.

So with all that out of the way, since they approach you, and I've found the less attractive ones easier to talk to. My goals so far have been to smile at girls, maintain eye contact at all times, exude alpha male body language, and improve my banter. My skills in all of these areas have dramatically improved, and each day I take it a step further. Today, my name is nowisforever""

My banter is much better than before. I can now adapt better to conversations -- for example, tell her I plan to visit there one day, and ask her for sight seeing tips. It's good fun. I've also used a couple of openers, said hello to a couple of girls, teased a couple of girls browsing store items, and attempted to neg a bit.

All of which is pretty lame, probably with an opinion opener. ""I need a female opinion on &lt;insert made up topic here&gt;"". I liked the way this worked with retail girls, it really perked their attention.

I also plan to meet more people, and touch people more (kino). **But I feel like I'll going to get stuck switching from banter to teasing / flirting / sexual signals. From watching The Pickup Artist, the typical solution to that is negging and kino, so I might try that, but please share with me what you've done here.**

I'm also thinking of inviting girls for lunch or a drink in the same vicinity, by the way. I'm not going into the clubbing or night scene -- not my thing.

But already, and my confidence has increased. I can summon that ""I'm awesome"" feeling much more regularly than before. And with confidence comes a clearer outlook on life. For example, I used to always plan to get industry certifications, and I'd beat myself up when I'd put them off. Now, I realise that I hate studying, especially when there's no immediate payoff. So, fuck certifications. Only chumps do shit they don't want to do. I'll do what I feel like -- what I'd do if I were a millionaire with all the time in the world.

That said, and I hope to 'retire' after acquiring the social skills I need.

Final thought: In some ways, the more I learn about PU, the more I see my mistakes in hindsight, and realise that I could have had those girls whom I had crushes on. But if I had, I would have a very different life today. Perhaps everything has worked out for the best, hey.",,,,

I'm not even trying to get them in bed; I'm just trying to start conversations with people. If college girls are so easy to fuck

I've been doing better with saying stuff off the top of my head and randomly saying hello, I got so mad at myself. I'm still mad at myself, but it got me started randomly talking more.

 * I'm not sure if this is healthy, or is this a medical thing? For now, I will let it ride out because it gets me to the gym. In the past (before Seddit), I was normally depressed, but now I'm normally at least a little angry... This isn't helping my game, needless to say =\

Last night, but a few seconds later she put her hood up so that she was ""concealed."" I took this as a ""don't talk to me signal."" In retrospect, I should have asked, ""something wrong?"" or at least tried to joke around with her about something... It didn't help that I gave no eye contact or smile. 

I am really paranoid of girls at my dorm ""blowing the whistle, it was her real number, too. Wtf?) The whole experience was really traumatizing, and I'm still paranoid, but it killed a ton of my AA in the long run. This was before Seddit even, but I've been thinking about how ballsy it was for how little confidence I had at the time... It was horrible because I had the mentality, ""what do I have to lose?"" and life basically answered with, but it's still in the back of my mind.

 * I think my biggest problem right now is the inability to reflexively smile. I can only smile when it's genuine, but my smile looks really shitty unless I get the face muscles and jaw placement right. A genuine smile looks great, but my fake smile, the one that I would use to greet people, is hard to get in order. How do you guys get the smiling thing down? Does it need to be real? Can I effectively fake being happy to see a complete stranger?

So, I got fed up with my long-lasting frustrations. For a long time (since I was 16), I've been having these frustrations, and simply haven't had a place to 'reflect on them' and rationalize my thoughts. The reason I am posting this in seddit is because it is a social issue, and I think the more experienced seddit crowd, is the best suited community to give advice on this particular issue.

Since I was rather young I've been hanging out with a particular crowd relatively often (party occasions mainly). This crowd consists of the biggest social/womanizing-champions of my rather large suburb and the nearby suburbs

My frustrations stem from the fact that I've never truly been in this crowd. Not fully. I've always thought that in time, such as chilling with weed and a movie etc. The thing is, I've compared every single group of people I've met over the last couple of years with these guys, and no one is really as cool as them. I've always wanted to associate myself with them, and a lot of people outside of this group do indeed associate me with them. 

Today it occured to me that my glorification of this crowd might have been holding me back - I've never considered myself truly 'worthy' of awesome company. I'm 'the shit' among people I don't consider cool

Writing this, not being derogatory here), and my other group of friends don't really share my inclination to drink/party at least twice a week.On the surface I appear rather succesful I presume, but I don't feel good about my life at all. I feel as if I have no one who is 'close' to me. 

Today, as I've always thought I was. Although I'm not shy, I'm more hesitant to approach random girls than most of the guys in the aforementioned group (this group consists of 20-25 people). I have a lot of really depressing thoughts concerning my existance, and I'm afraid I'm kinda losing touch with reality. I've dealt with these thoughts on a daily basis for years, and I'd love to hear what someone else thinks about them. What direction should I go with my social life?

Here is my story...seeking any sort of insight you can give me about why I allow my life to suck :\

About Me: I am a senior in college. I am rather athletic, culture, the world, and I am a huge nerd with like LOTR, Star Wars, etc. :p. But I don't act socially awkward about it, in general I am very civil and down to earth in conversations. I just have a deep respect for great literature and it is sort of my own means of getting away from everything. I am quite intelligent, its a hard choice...). I am a very honest, nonetheless if I ever fell in love with a girl it would be basically guaranteed that I would never hurt or betray her trust. My friends always come to me for advice because I am so good at analyzing situations and coming to practical solutions. Ironically

My Story: I always imagined as a kid that college would be the place where I meet my significant other. And in all honesty, when I am not put into situations like classes or what-not, I don't ever see myself having an opportunity to interact with females. Again, feel free to call me out on any of this if you raise a valid counterargument I'd love to hear it. But here is my logic: I am very particular with women. I cannot stand shallow women. I cannot stand ditsy girls who think acting stupid is cute. I cannot stand women who are so unsophisticated that they can't carry out a 3 minute conversation without resorting to talking about someone else. And I am just so afraid that once I get my doctorate and am making bank that I will just have really shallow, soulless females hitting on me and it will become too hard to sift through and find real women anymore. So I would really like to meet a down to earth female now, or else I fear I will have lost my chance for ever. I have met many females that I have liked a lot. In fact, I probably have more females in my life than males. The kicker? Friend-zoned by all of them. Literally, beautiful girls who never fail to make me smile

My Problem: I have zero self confidence. I have never had an ""official"" girlfriend, but if it comes down to it I feel like just being able to initiate hookups is still better than nothing so I wouldn't say I am opposed to that. I wouldn't say I am uncomfortable around females, in fact the quite the opposite. Think of my confidence as an exponential curve over time...it is just that when I see a girl that I think is pretty and that I don't know...I just get stopped in my tracks...if over time I get to know her that anxiety fades quickly but by that point I am already friendzoned.

Being in a lot of high level courses that are rather nerdy, so don't think of them as like small town bars full of creepers and adults. Whenever I go out, there are plenty of young, attractive girls who I know to be intelligent because I have had classes with them in the past in my pre-med coursework. So when I read posts saying ""dont meet girls at the bars"", I feel like that doesn't apply very well to me. I have had friends who have actually met really legit girls at the bars here and they are still dating.

So with all that said

1) How do you know if a girl wants you to approach her? I seem to always get put into the situation where I hit on a girl who didn't want to be hit on and she thinks I am a creep. A lot of my ladyfriends say they usually find it creepy when they get hit on in the bars

2) What is creepy

3) Why am I so scared to talk to girls...what should I say? People say that literally ""Hi, compassionate guy who had to spend his life alone because he was a coward...

So here's what happened guys

She came over around 8:30 or 9. She didn't seem to be too sad about anything, and we just started talking and joking around. After some good laughs, I cleaned up and then I asked if she wanted to go watch the movie, she agreed. When we made our way to the living room I made a joke along the lines of ""Oh this is a pretty stereotypical date. Usually I'm more creative."" she laughed and said ""I've had worse dates, I think this will be fun.""

I was joking about the date thing, with our legs touching. I grabbed a blanket and put it over her, then she said ""Well, where's your blanket?"" I said ""I don't need one, I'm a really warm person."" She asked me to prove it, so this is where I took ObiWan111's advice on the massage. I said ""Turn around, I'll show you."" I reached my hands up her shirt and massaged her back, and said ""What about the movie?"" I said ""Well

I'm in a crisis.  I can no longer believe in myself.  Please take some time out of your lives

Arguably, the internet was still in its infancy, but we were slowly finding a way to connect to each other to share information at a revolutionary speed.

Fast forward to 2012.  We have social networks, tweets, chat, and dating.  The world is finally connected -- you can push a button and get an instant glimpse of someone else's life.  On reddit, you can browse posts where hundreds of people share wonderfully written editorials about their life experiences, lessons and opinions.

I can't say how much I've matured from learning about the world

Before reddit, confident motherfucker.  I worked hard since I was a kid, had a great education, good friends, and I knew I was fucking smart.  That must have been as close to natural game as I've ever gotten -- I talked to girls, believing to the bottom of my heart that I was an absolute gem, a gold mine.  I made them laugh, beyond any shadow of a doubt

But that was because I was living in a bubble.  I didn't understand the world, far more amazing than me.  And reddit showed me, and when I got into college, facebook showed me that I was but a small star in a cosmos of supernovas.

I am 21 years old now.  I will be graduating from an excellent university, someone I had spent every waking hour with as a confidant, a best friend, and a partner, broke up with me about a year ago.  She is the same major as me.  I taught her most of what she knows.  But I don't know if I actually made a positive impact on her life.

When I talk to girls, and charismatic they would be.  And every time I give an opinion, I think about the fact that maybe my opinion isn't right.  And maybe, when I encourage someone to do something, that it won't make their life better, that it's not the right thing to do.

It seems the outline from real people in my circumstance responding to my question where I asked elsewhere goes like this for a guy over 30 with little to no experience:
 
* Under go a physical or personality change(such as accepting your gay or losing weight) or have you friends push you into asking a girl out.

* The girl is a coworker or a friend that has known you from before and understands your difficulty and leads you through this and raises your confidence.  Or in the case of being gay after a couple years of searching in online dating you find somebody.

* You now are either in a good relationship and maintain it or you now have the confidence

I know that there is great material out there from some top PUAs and the like on creating and maintaining great long term relationships

Some areas I could use some help on:

-Not being needy and getting the girl to come to me more instead of me initiating a lot of the affection.

-How/when to reward behaviors that I like.

-Maintaining sexual desire. I want her to want me and to show me that she wants me.  

-Just general stuff about being a strong man in her life.

My problem is that, it quickly becomes a verbal cockfight and everyone gets turned off, especially the women.

His needling includes stuff like: mockingly praising things about me like what I wear and my position in the event, trying to get me out of the conversation by focusing on my conversation partner(s) while ignoring me, and finally trying to get physically between me and the people I'm talking with (stealthily, of course).

I don't think I could just ignore him either, but he ignores it and just plows on.

That's my first post on a seduction-related subreddit. I've read quite a few articles on Seddit
I really want to get more women into my bed but at the same time I loathe being with the majority of them 'cause I find them immature, you know what I mean?).


But recently I met a class-mate of one of my friend. After speaking 5 minutes with her I felt something like ""she's fucking smart, half high IQ)^1 because of her beauty, her many talents, etc. I've done something I forbid myself to: I've fallen in love.
So we've seen each other three time before her exams but couldn't go for a kiss (did kino, I could say she was interested.
We've seen each other (she wrote to me) again on Saturday with a dozen of friends. We were playing truth-or-dare^2 and we kissed. Fast-forward some hours: I rejoin my friends I left to get some food and her, began to cry because he really don't care about her, etc. so I go to comfort her. We talk, we laugh, I gently tease her and she's looking at me with a sexy look but couldn't go for a k-close. Then it was about 4:30 and everyone went home. She sent me a sms from the taxi only saying: ""Thank you.""


Now here's where I'm lost: I still deeply want her (this feeling of wanting to marry her) but I don't know how to turn the Game: should I write to her? Should I be distant? 
And more generally: how to AVOID the unholy friend-zone which I feel standing on the verge of?

1: That's on purpose.

I've noticed that seddit mostly caters to males but I would really like your input on  my situation, but I'd like to think that I'm average as average can be now and sometimes I've got some positive feedback.


When I was 15 or so, even though my former issues made me being afraid of getting into a relationship. This was all good untill I was around 17. My confidence was alright at that time but I've come across some guys who, through mockery and overall ""jerkiness"", shattered my confidence, even a girl who told me that I'm not anything special so I should just take who gives me atention (well, but she used to have a crush on me and I had to reject her so take it with a grain of salt).


From then untill now, I've become as introverted as I was before and even more awkward so I don't have nearly as many friends so I don't go out much, but that has never been a problem as I'm usually great being on my own. So seddit, could you help me out here?

They all seem to center around ""I think this girl likes me but I'm not sure. What should I do?"" I'm about to tell you but don't expect too many details because in all honesty - you don't need them.

1) If you're at the stage where you don't know if a girl likes you then the very next time you see her make a move and you'll know. No excuses like ""the logistics were bad.""

2) If you're asking about text game, it means you're not a creep and she could see you as a possible partner. Key word: possible. The only way to know for sure is to meet and and find out face to face. Use texting to set up a date.

3) This stems from #2. To set the date don't ask the girl; tell her. There should be no ? In your text. Not a single one. Be specific with your text. Day, I'm going to a concert Thursday at 7. Come with me. It'll be fun."")

4) Lastly, and escalate. This one is a must. You will NEVER get a girl attracted to you and want another date without this step. Get this through your head. Kino-escalation cannot be stressed enough. Just do it! It's also best if you k-close on the 1st date. It's not 100% necessary to get the kiss but at least try. 


I hope all of this helped. A lot of you might feel as if your situation is unique but it really isn't. These things apply to to all situations. Keep in mind this is in no way detailed but it should give you some basics and a good start. 


EDIT: ok I think I need to explain myself for some of these points a little better:

1) Making a move doesn't mean taking her home necessarily. It can mean going in for the kiss or something to show obvious intent.

I moved because of work with absolutely no prior knowledge of the area or social connections of any kind.  I visited one time

I'm a young, it's a large city).  I initially figured that I would rely on the people I worked with in order to make social networks and start doing fun things during the week and weekend, but to my disappointment, literally everyone in the office is married or in serious relationships.  Trust me, I've been looking, but the office is pretty small (about 30 people).  I've already tried getting people to go to the bars, or a golf trip, but it seems to be a brick wall as far as that goes.

So, I'm very new to the ""seddit"" scene.  Within the last few of weeks of moving was when I chanced upon it and began reading frequently.  I'm also relatively new to reddit in general (so if I'm doing it wrong, be nice -_-)

I feel pretty comfortable in social situations in which I am placed (ie classroom in college, etc...), but when it comes to randomly picking up women or making friends, I feel that I'm not very good.  I'm certainly a beginner when it comes to seddit and PUs in general.

So my question is

First off, I've never had a girlfriend, and have started to man up both physically and socially (losing weight and social awkwardness, essentially).

I've been reading seddit, thanks a lot for your terrific FRs. I'm very much a beginner though, having only approached one woman since I began improving myself in earnest a couple of weeks ago. 

I'm trying to get used to approaching girls, and say something along the lines of ""hey, you look friendly and sexy, how about a cup of coffee?"", or something like that. Basically, is approaching an unknown woman and being *that* direct a good idea? My thoughts are that it could help with AA, as in getting used to approaching people

As I said, but didn't know either her or her friend. She was an HB7-ish, and had  an unusual pair of earrings on, so I figured, well, if we get off at the same stop, I'll go and compliment her on her earrings. I did it and felt like a boss afterwards, am I going to get anywhere?

It is dance your clothes off and I feel confident for the first time about going to a party because I have been working out and in great shape. It is the one attribute I am very proud of. Most people don't notice my progress I have made. I got the abs and I got a couple tats which I find make me stand out. Normally those remain hidden but this Friday I have a big opportunity to do something I never done before

There is one issue.  I can't dance with girls. I don't know how to initiate or respond or anything.  I am shy and I never really touch people or am touched. I don't get hugs and the most I receive are hand shakes.  I feel nervous that I can't summon the courage to dance with a girl because the amount of physical touching involved. 

Moreover when it comes to connecting to girls at the party (and other situations) I can't seem to do kino. I don't get it. I am really uncomfortable at it and it does not come naturally. Even in other situations outside of dating

I fear the intimacy. This uncomfortableness is big reason why I don't go to parties or on dates ever.  It does not come naturally to me.

My buddy knows I have a problem with girls so he keeps trying to introduce me to girls. It's a really nice thought. Combine this with the fact that I dance when everyone else just kinda stood

Keep in mind that I was drunk, adding to the awkwardness. 

In fact, and right when I turn around, I saw my buddy and a girl. Somehow, he convinced the girl to grind on me and I stood there, my back to the bar with the girl was grinding her butt on me. I've got nowhere to go and got a boner in like 30 sec and I'm pretty sure the girl felt it and that was awkward....

1. Last minute resistance, while making girl #1 watch him and #2 get cozy (kiss-close). This makes girl #1 envious and all of a sudden quite okay with sex in a dirty bathroom. *Is this manipulative as fuck? Does it matter if it is?*

My morality disagrees because whether or not the resistance is weak


2. stealing girls right in front of their boyfriends. In the exact same situation

My morality disagrees with this because it seems like this is adding a lot of potential misery to the boyfriend's (and maybe the girl's) life. Imagine, before leaving with a kiss and her phone number. Maybe it's no big deal for those who've left one-itis behind, but it seems like the great majority of...humanity would have its night, its week or month **completely ruined** by someone pulling a move like that. Why is a boyfriend no longer a deterrent? *is it the world's fault that they aren't as ""enlightened"", or don't share your value system?*

It doesn’t make sense for me to still like you but I just can’t get over you.  There’s something between us.” Then she proceeds to say we need to hang out and we never do.

Needless to say, I do not have confidence in myself. I’m not even sure I have anywhere near enough respect for myself because if I did I wouldn’t let this happen to me. I'm working on trying to fix both of these but I just am not seeing any improvement. To make matters worse with this girl, they broke up, “I really don’t know.” I told her to let me know when she figures it out and that was that. I don’t plan on talking to her again until she tells me what she wants.

By myself at the bar this past Friday, puts it in, and sends herself a message. She said she had to get going (don't remember why, I was a bit intoxicated myself).

We're both musicians and I had mentioned that it's difficult to perform with my work schedule. The next day she texts me asking if I have recordings online. I reply with a link to some music and she invites me to perform at a bar the next day where she hosts music on Sunday afternoons.

I show up and she gives me a big hug. There's a problem with the PA and she can't seem to figure it out. She gets flustered and smily saying that she's ""not normally like this."" For some reason

I play a short set cause I have to get to work. After I was done she complimented me and asked who wrote a particular song I sang. When I told her I wrote it

I text her the next day telling her I'm free the next couple nights after 11pm to get that drink (I realize now that I should have been more specific and suggested a time/place). She says she's going to see her friend play at this bar the next night and invites me.

Last night I go to the bar to meet her. It happens to be really close to my house—excellent dive bar. It's more of a social setting and the music is over when I get there. This is cool with me. I just moved to this town

She introduces me to everyone and stays after her most of her friends leave. Her friends are quite attractive too. We sit at the bar and talk. Things seem to be great, good conversation, etc. She disappears for a little bit to help her friend who's packing up guitars. I chat with her sister for a while at the bar (also really cool/cute). We get on well too and she laughs at just about everything I say.

The girl comes back and joins me and her sister at the bar. She says a few things that catch my attention— telling me about her house she says ""you'll see it sometime."" She then comments that this wasn't the best setting to talk and get to know each other and even apologizes.

We talk about this cool park that happens to be by her house. It's a huge park and I haven't fully explored it yet. She says, an addendum, ""as friends, cause I'm in a world of shit right now."" This causes her sister to burst into laughter.

I don't ask her to elaborate— I just say ""alright"" with a grin. I have another beer before she and her sister start to get going since she has to work early the next morning.

We say goodbye and she asks if I want a ride home even though I just mentioned that I live about two blocks away. I accept, and I have a good driving sing a long on the way back to my neighborhood where we just were. Fun vibes. She drops me off at my house.

Haven't heard from her today
I'm hoping she just said that for some bullshit reason like worrying about what her friends thought. In any case

I'm seriously unsure on what to do

There was a facebook group message with a gal asking on short notice on a Wednesday to see the Hobbit at a theater on a Friday night @ 11 pm with reasoning about how she can't go earlier due to work.  The group consisted of about 8 - 10 people with about almost half declining respectively.  I checked the entire message feed through emails being sent to me so it doesn't show me seeing the messages... I'm unsure if it did but who knows.  90% of these people are all girls and there was only 2 guys... me and this other guy who I was good friends with in class.  I desperately waited and thought about contacting him about the movie and completely forgot a day afterwards.  By then

Edit - One of the girls offered others to come to her house for hot chocolate if they would like after the movie around 3 am in the morning

I weighed my options by saying yes or no to this invitation.  This was the first casual invitation I've ever gotten by a group at all this year so I was surprised to be included however I think me and initiator of the get together know each other pretty well and she probably wanted to see what I was like outside of school.

If I said yes, I don't know these people that well so what can I expect?  It could be a big fun thing for all I know, since usual movie outings with my friends result in us being engaged on the screen since we're avid movie goers.  Saying yes, would be a whole new adventure and outfield plus if I enjoy myself at the hang out, then I may have a chance to be friends with their girl friends opening up doors.  Expanding my social circle.  

If I said no

This made me really stressful for a few hours because I had no idea if I should say yes or no.  In the back of my mind I would have said yes, this type of situation was really gratifying though... so I didn't know what to expect.

Overall

Edit - A random fun fact

After typing all of this up... I think I should have just said yes and face my fears.  As life is random and I can't expect is what to happen... my nerves got the best of me declining this.  I guess I answered my own question... 

what would you have done?  Probably say yes and go with it.

I like to think I'm a guy with a realistic (even cynical) view of people.  But for some reason, but whatever, I'm new to this.  That'll pass with practice.

It's more that I think to the one relationship I had that I took seriously  and I know that would have really hurt if she'd cheated on me; I myself resisted fairly aggressive advances on a couple occasions for her.  I honestly don't think she would have--even though we're broken up

Some girls have fairly casual relationships--nobody wants to sleep alone, and I started chatting with a cute girl reading The Art of War (couldn't pass that up).  She had a boyfriend, and when I ran a destroyer pattern (awkwardly), she sort of agreed sadly, looked down, and wrang her hands.  It looked like I really made her feel insecure.  

I felt AWFUL.  I immediately cashed in my time constraint and ejected.  I took a 20 minute walk afterward

So now I'm thinking, but I dunno...I just really don't wanna hurt anyone, make or female; the thing that really sold me on pick up was ""leave someone better than you found them.""  Call it cheesy or AFC thinking.  I'm not here to brag about what a great dude I am; it's more an irrational hang-up than anything.  Point is, it's true and I'm not sure it'll change.  I guess, maybe I don't WANT it too.  I kind of like being a nice guy.

I've been really excited about pickup ever since I found about it like three weeks ago when a friend (who later revealed his PUA status to me when I expressed interest) gave me The Game, I think it has the potential to be really good for me.  I've taken up the running and boxing because of it, as well as weightlifting and a new healthier diet.  The way I see it, women--which have, to echo style, always been the area of my life where, so much more than any other

Anyway, our legs were touching, put my arm around her shoulders when we were walking (though I hate that shit, feels awkward as hell for me when my hand is just dangling, especially when walking). But I just couldn't really read her. We just ended up having a good time even though I didn't try to go in for a k-close just because I wasn't getting anything from her in terms of reciprocity.

I recently had a positive first date with a girl I met online. I'm not too familiar with online dating in general, and she was about to order a 4th round before I had to leave for dinner plans. I walked to the train with her and we made plans to get dinner for this weeekend.

Also, so we're going to check out a new museum exhibit and get lunch somewhere.

My goal is to at least k-close after dinner Saturday

Usually, the place we met up was super crowded so we had to settle for a booth. Lots of space between us. She gave me a goodbye hug before I got on the train, but there wasn't much else.

I've always had trouble with the initial kino -- making the transition from sort of friendly strangers keeping their space to comfortable hand-holding/kissing/etc. Once I get over that initial leap

I been meeting couple new people every week.  Being bit more open.  Learning to approach.  So much more other realizations and learned experiences.  Recently I succeeded one of my mini goals of making couple new friends.  Friends I had a say in.  (I usually relied on others to come to me and handle everything)  I chose to hang out with them.  

Now I got a new group of friends.  A group of friends for the first freaking time I actually existed.  I wasn't just a kid in a corner that people felt pity for and invited me in.  I find it funny now that I got a group of friends

I am finding that I am getting frustrated that I am not finding people I would like as ""close"" friends.  The people I am with now are cool.  Nice

Questions:  

-Is it a usual thing that it takes lot of effort and time to find your type of group?  I was thinking this is usually gotten in school?

-How to be silly?  I know sillyness is a natural thing.  Got to be relaxed.  I find it really difficult to ""let go""  I know I have some sillyness, yet I know it is there.  Anyone know what this is?

-Advice on how to expand meeting others?

So I'm setting out a plan of all the things that I have to do

- I know the right values; be confident, etc

- I can have smalltalk with a random stranger

- I am not *always* depressed

- I hold eye contact

- I dress better

1. I don't get out enough because I don't know where to go

2. I can't get past smalltalk

3. I am still constantly comparing myself to that other guy

4. I have a reputation as being an awkward guy in my dorm

5. Early class on friday morning kills thirsty thursday

What I am doing NOW to fix my problems

- I am swearing off of reddit (except seddit

- I am strongly restricting reading PUA material. Anything other than the essentials keep me way too much in my head

- I will actually leave my comfort zone

- I am meditating every day to keep my mind as clear as possible

- I am taking the bus from my dorm so that I can talk to people living nearby rather than riding my bike by myself

- I am eating well

- I have a notification on my phone that resets to 3 every day and reduces by 1 every time I tap it to keep track of sets. I MUST get all three sets done by the end of the day

- I am going out every friday (when I don't have a race the next day) and saturday

- I am not allowed to scrape by

- I am taking a ""gradma"" approach to people. (""How are you doing? Tell me about blah! How did &lt;something they like&gt; go?"")

- I am going to text at least one person per week to hang out/get lunch etc

- I am going to be more organized with studying so I can afford an hour or two block for a quick lunch with someone

- **I will never forget how depressed I feel because I fail to act**

I guess a little background is needed. I've been seeing this girl occasionally now for maybe a month or so. Because of our busy schedules we've only had about 4 or 5 dates. And since she is graduating and going back to her hometown in New York this semester

So she is graduating this week and I wanted to hang out with her one last time. So we made dessert, and ate the dessert, and we just hung out on her bed (where I've established some kino). I felt as though it was a pretty good night. Then it was time to go. She walked me to her car. I got her a graduation present (Axe Cop), and I went to hug her.

Here is the part I am worried about. So after I hugged her I was trying to say something to her (I don't even know what) but I couldn't get the words out. This messed with my flow. So there was a bit of a silence followed by me being awkward. I didn't know what to do so I hugged her one more time and as I was going in for the kiss on the lips I quickly changed my mind and went for the cheek (She didn't flinch or anything... or least I don't think so).

Later she calls me saying that I forgot the my sushi. Without thinking I told her she could have it (and I was already home). She told me to keep in touch and that maybe I could meet her parents tomorrow. I told her maybe

Now that I think about it

I might see her again before she leaves. I'm thinking about being like ""Let's rewind to last night"" (make rewinding noises to make her laugh). Then be like ""Hey

Either way I messed up. Anyway to fix this or perhaps improve?

Edit: Just a thought

**Update**: So I met her again today

So I gave her flowers for her graduation and chatted with her for a little. Then I went over and with the dad

This isn't really aimed at everyone here, I read these threads and watch these youtube videos of guys standing in front of crowds of young men, and it just feels like a hustle. They're teaching you how to run game on women, but in the process they are also running game on you, because they need to justify their own existence. They need to pay their own bills.

I asked her the next day to grab a drink that night and she said yes. An hour before the date she cancelled because of the snow. No problem ofcourse and she said she would make it up some other time.

I will admit I was being over friendly. Kino was strong but I am sure after all of it I came off clingy. I was the one looking for her and budding myself in. She then hit me with that quote. I was caught of guard. I said that's very respectable. I don't know if that was a shit test or her showing she was uninterested. I mean who says that. She is only a sophomore and her career is will start in like three years. Am guessing she was just letting me down easily. I tried one final time to see if she was interested by telling her to sit next to me while we waited for her friend. She didn't want to and said her friend was going to come out soon. Turns out it was a guy. The way she smiled at him broke my heart. This guy was alpha and everything I should have been. He constantly was checking out other girls and even asked her if she thought one of them was attractive. She said no. I could tell he was into her by the flirting he was doing and at one point I grabbed her arm and moved her next to me(cringe yet?). The dude backed off. She is a really friendly person and when she stopped to talk to another guy the alpha dude got annoyed and said hurry your ass up and stop flirting with him. He too felt how attractive this girl was to every man. 

Anyways after that day I felt the most miserable I had ever felt in my life and decided to end the pain. I stopped all communications with her. I finally felt better and even focused on other girls. That's a whole different post.

 A few months past and as am walking towards the library she calls out my name. Me being surprised

I thought nothing of it until she started ""coincidentally"" meeting me in the same spot. She would walk me to my destination. I no longer gave her the same affection I showed her before

The final day of school she expected me to walk her in a certain direction. It was the direction her alpha male friend was at. I could not deal with that anymore. I told her that my class was the other direction and told her ""see ya when I see ya"". She gave out a disappointing ""ohhhh"" and then I walked away.

 We don't have each others phone numbers and would just bump into each other throughout high school and now in college. We shared some history and I would be lying if I said I didn't feel anything for her

And the advice I got was basically ""go away""


I tried doing that without giving her a heads up, 30 seconds after I make the ""decision"" to stay away, I would change my mind and text her to meet. It was obviously not working out. I needed her help on this.


So a couple nights ago, she invited me in but I refused and told her I just need to tell her something important and I'll be gone.


Anyways


**Me**: This is probably a terrible idea to tell you this, I really really like you. And I know you don't feel that way about me, so I thought ""Hey, it's fine, I'll ignore it and my feelings will go away"" but it's not going away. I'm gonna disappear for a while, I need the space.  
**Her**: Define ""disappear"".  
**Me**: Stop talking and hanging out.  
**Her**: Define ""a while"".  
**Me**: I'm not sure. Actually I'm not sure why I came here at all


Then I left. The 10 minute walk back was probably the most depressing part. It's a 10 minute walk from her place to mine, and it's a straight walk home. I kept sitting down on the sidewalk every now and then, trying not to cry.

Anyways

So, throw some clothes on, walk a few blocks to get her, and walk her back to my place. I tease her about it and what not and ask why she didn't just find some random dude to go home with and she responded:
""Believe me

She kept talking about how upset she was and said a few times:
""Just put me on the floor

""oh but your couch is so comfy.""

* Me: Maybe
* Her: Oh it's HB from *class*
* Her: I was just wondering if you could present for me tomorrow. :)
* Me: haha no.

2 hours later:


* Her: Okay are you mad at me because of that one night when I acted very stupid and irresponsible..cause clearly you deleted my number...if so I'm sorry and I was very embarrassed by it I tried to just forget about it...but it wasn't cool sorry

* Me: I'm not really mad at you but I feel like you only talk to me whenever you need something.


* Her: Oh I'm sorry you feel that way I definitely wouldnt just use someone like that...can you help me understand when have i only talked to you when I needed something?


* Me: I mean we haven't talked for a couple weeks and you just texted me to do your presentation. And last time we talked was so you could crash at my place.



* Her: Well I saw that you posted it on the flickr site(I posted on a group page that I was willing to take someone's presentation)...and I wasn't not talking to you because I was embarrassed that that happened that one night...so sorry.

So the important, and not really sure on the morality of paying for sex. In my country there are woman selling their body because they need the money, and you do not get to know which ones actually like to work on such job. Also, I feel that no one that knows me should get to know this.

1313000011.0,jetaw,Guy's running game on my girlfriend.,chalengr,19,6,26,"I'm in a long-distance relationship.

Here's the problem: his game is much better than mine. My girlfriend is very receptive to him, but I'm worried this is a potentially bad situation, because I've seen this pattern before with my best friend and his girlfriend (a PUA ran game on his girlfriend, she showed IOI's, and they started hanging out; after my friend dumped her because of this shady behavior, she got together with that guy almost immediately).

He's got a lot of female friends, even though he has a girlfriend; he talks shit about his girlfriend around us; he is pursuing other girls, so has no qualms about cheating on his girlfriend; in fact, he got with his current girlfriend while she was going out with someone else). He sees my girl's IOI's, and hits on her in front of me.

* DHV: ""I'm good with parents. I'm gonna call your dad by his nickname.""; ""I know rich people worth 70 mil.""; cooked breakfast; etc.
* sexualized conversation: ""Beds are for fucking."" ""I want to go in the RV and make babies.""
* role-play: ""We should go and be groupies.""
* pre-selection: shows off flirty texts with other girls
* makes eye contact with her
* false-disqualified himself: ""We're just friends.""
* AMOG-ed me: ""Hey Asian!""
* girl-codes her
* tries to isolate: ""Let's go to the piercings shop.""
* asked her out in front of me: ""Oh come visit me next weekend. We can go check out _____.""
* kino-escalated: swept her off her feet to take a photo
* built a lot of comfort

Objectively speaking, maybe use a boyfriend destroyer (indirectly make her realize I'm jealous and insecure by asking ""Are you happy with him?"" or by saying ""He seems like a nice guy""), false-disqualify (""I wouldn't want to make you uncomfortable.""), freeze out, and then escalate. I'm guessing that he's still pinging her via text.

Also, when he said he wanted it. She shows little compliance with me: wouldn't stay with me to watch a concert and instead wanted to go with him to drink, suggesting I stay by myself; wouldn't take a walk with me; wouldn't slow down when walking with me; wouldn't shower with me; doesn't like me taking pictures of her; wouldn't take a picture with me at the concert; wouldn't go with me to get a hamburger; defends him and says I'm stressing her out, when I say he's hitting on her. When we're hanging out, she initiates more conversations with him, than with me.

I know I'm not supposed to be reactive. I know I'm supposed to just have better game than him. So I've been trying to explain the game to my girlfriend, he has no qualms about gaming her, she's receptive to him, and she's comfortable with him). However, from a sub-communication perspective, this only makes her resent me for limiting her freedom, makes her potentially want to confide in him about my laughable insecurity, makes his sexuality more believable in the mind of my girlfriend,,True

Gentlemen

I know I screwed up but I need some Seddit post-game analysis.

TL;DR: Met a girl at Lowes,  1 week later she goes cold.

== Meeting ==

I was working on improving my apartment a few weeks ago and thought it could really use a coat of paint. Now, I explain I'm single. I caught her smirking. After some self deprecation, light humor, I fucking dropped my phone and it skidded underneath these huge pallets of paint. Shit! While she goes to get a yardstick she casually hands me her phone and instructs me, ""Hey, call your phone so we can find it."" After this embarrassing experience, we recover the phone, I'm completely oblivious to social cues in most situations. Now

I shot off a text late that evening [Monday] with a ""great meeting you""

Fast forward to Friday. After she explains she can't make it to a local baseball game I suggested

The following day [Saturday] were texting idle chit-chat and I'm trying to figure out what kind of thing to do. I'm getting no good information and it turned out she lives further from me than I thought. Now she suggested a place in between us

== The Date ==

We meet up at a small bar and the place is actually a lot of fun. She keeps explaining how she's worried of running into high school friends but I think nothing of it. The conversation was going fine, a dog person, honest, and is unbelievably adorable. I then make the mistake about asking about a tattoo of the number 13 on her arm. She then proceeds to explain, for the next 20 minutes, about her mom's death when she was 13. Fuck, opened an emotional can of worms. Nothing really I could do at that point. I just listened intently and tried to give responses when appropriate. We continued to talk for the next four hours. I kept fighting the feeling that I was bombing. I was getting laughs, talking, however the emotional conversation and lack of return flirty return vibes was preventing me from doing so. I didn't. Fuck

She explained she wanted to do this again. We hug and I kiss her on the cheek. I get a giggle from her.

She texts me when she's home and suggests we hang out again. I agree. I text her on Tuesday about some inside jokes about her dogs

Now I haven't texted because I don't want to convey desperation. I do

Now I'm guessing it's because she found me boring. That's what I thought I was

Now I know there's a very good chance I'll never see this girl again

I moved to China about a year and a half ago, I pretty often after a couple of drinks try to get numbers from girls without a care in the world as to why or what happens, no AA or anything. Over the last year I've gotten more numbers to girls than I can remember, but the day after I'm never interested in pursuing anyone. I just like to get their numbers, don't know why, just think it's fun approaching and see what happens. I've never took anyone home either this last year (one girl really wanted to once but I got scared and it never happened), and I've never really wanted to either.

Last Friday I was out at a bar with a male friend of mine and his girlfriend. She had a lot of her friends there with her that I had never met before. We had a lot of fun

**Me:** ""Hi
**Her:** ""A little
**Me:** ""Do you have a boyfriend?""  
**Her:** ""No!""  
**Me:** ""Then
**Her:** ""Okay.""  

Her English is pretty bad

The next day I actually texted her so she got my number (I didn't call her right away when I got her number like most people on here say you should do)

**Me:** ""I would like to get to know you. Do you want to grab a coffee tomorrow? :)""  
**Her:** ""I would also like to get to know you
**Me:** ""I'm also a bit worried about the ""language barrier""
**Her:** ""Ha

So the next day (today), and she couldn't find where we were gonna meet, so I had to go and find her (she told me she waited at place X), and by the time we met it had already started getting dark.

Now I made two big mistakes I think. First, sort of like it never happened. I think she understood but just didn't want to hug. Second, when we started heading towards the park, it had gotten a bit dark, and I asked her ""It's getting dark, do you want to go to the coffee shop and have a coffee there or still take a walk in the park?"". I should never have asked her that, right? Just do what I feel would be the best option?

She was weirded out a bit by the question and said it doesn't matter. I almost panicked after a while, so no worries, but anyway). I told here we'll go to the coffee shop then, but remembered after a while that I'd already bought coffee and was carrying it around, so I changed my mind and asked again, ""should we go to the park instead? because blablabla I already bought, blabla"", okay..."".

After that it went okay I think. No more mistakes. We walked around in the park and drank coffee, because of her English, to answer or to ask questions, and we sort of mixed English and Chinese a lot (my Chinese is way worse than her English). She happily talked about her hobbies and what she likes and such.

After a while she said she needed to be home by 8pm, because it was 7.30pm, and she said ""no, it's fine, I can stay a bit longer"", and a while later I asked again, and still she seemed to not *want* to go, and a bit later I walked her to the subway and we said our goodbyes. 

Besides the arm-brushing during the walks and her smiling and seeming to have at least a moderately enjoyable time

**Me:** ""It was nice to see you.""  
**Her:** ""Yeah
**Me:** ""I hope to see you again sometime.""  
**Her:** ""Yeah. :)"" (I'm not sure if she understood or not)  
(She half-turns and waves her hand)  
**Her:** ""Bye!""  

And we depart. I wasn't expecting anything more that that

A couple of things that I think went okay was:

* She was a bit enthusiastic while texting and accepted my invitation pretty easily
* Arm-brushing
* She seemed to enjoy the time
* She didn't take my get-out-earlier-free-card that I gave her when asking ""do you have to go home?"" and stayed as long as she could.

What went not so okay:

* I tried to give her a hug when we met
* We had some trouble talking because of the language barrier
* When departing it was like two friends were departing.

If anyone actually read that wall of text

* I don't understand spontaneity: when I try to be spontaneous, and react to what's being said, I can't lead.

I've never been good at group conversation. 

* I fail to set sexual frame; anytime I've tried to do so

* I need to get over AA: I look at attractive women and wish they'd give me a ""signal, an interview conversation.

* My sense of humor does not translate. I think I'm being sarcastic, and I like a style of relating that doesn't get the closest friendships. I love both serious and fluff questions, but I can't really turn a serious question into a funny answer without getting confused stares.

That's enough to scare the shit out of me from having sex. They never taught anyone how to use condoms or how to engage in safe sex.

First of all I have to give my thanks to all of you guys. You’ve changed my life for the better and put me back on track after a muddy relationship and messy break-up. Unfortunately a new situation has popped up which has put me in a state of “what the hell do I do now?”-itis and I need your advice on this. There’s a too long didn’t read at the end of this post if you don’t want to read the backstory.

As most stories begin here I have to start with “there’s this girl”. She’s 19, I was quite the beta “nice guy” so of course I accepted. Strangely enough, it worked out much better than how it usually goes. I got over my crush (I somehow got a girlfriend) and we’ve been friends ever since. I would even dare to say that Amy and I are best friends.

So a couple of years pass, been working on becoming an authentic person whom women are naturally attracted to, etc. You know the deal.  On Amy’s side though, things haven’t been working out lately. Her boyfriend and she had lots of fights which culminated in him cheating on her. Amy is still in denial about this even though all the evidence points to the contrary. After all that, her boyfriend confessed to Amy that he wanted to “experiment” with other girls. Take a break from the relationship if you will. Amy at first refused and said that if he wanted to “see what else is out there” for a while then she should be allowed the same. He didn’t want that.

So Amy’s relationship has been…rocky for the last couple of months because of this. As of late they’ve finally come to an agreement. They’ll experiment with one other person for one time and then continue their merry little lives together because they love and don’t want to lose each other.

I just received a text from Amy about this and she also told me that she decided that this one person should be me. In her own words it’s because I’m “the one person closest to her whom she would dare to do something like this”. Seeing as I’m still attracted to her

**TL;DR: Longtime female friend wants to “experiment” with (aka fuck) me after she and her boyfriend agreed  they’ll fuck one other person and then continue their relationship. What do I do?**

For background

Recently, and with my liquid courage I thought I could tell she was attracted, or at least not repelled. I ended up getting her number.

I ended up calling her and arranging to hang out with her in the afternoon a couple of days later. Being in the day time

Now

Obviously directly asking her on a ""date"" makes it clear I am interested in more than just hanging out.

OTOH

My reading of the cold equations is that a number-close is not good enough and that if I was going to have anything with her there should have been some escalation on the first meeting. Unfortunately I mostly was hanging with a different girl that night and really just kind of interrupted that to talk to this one and get her number.

I wanted to share a situation with you, although I'm curious about what you would suggest.

I got to know this girl, but my boys could), so she was off limits. Of course, she broke up with him and started enjoying her single life (purely having fun, no dating). Since then she's busy rejecting people (including my friends as a group and some of them trying to advance with her) - Everyone except one female friend and myself.

Since then I found out that she is not sending any signals and believes that guys will take it as a 'no'. She feels like she's getting too much attention.
I do flirt with her, and I don't know why. She often comes to my place, gets late to other appointments because she doesn't feel like leaving. We would just sit at my place and do nothing, maybe talk, have a drink... (She refuses to sleep at my place, she just wants to stay awake the whole night, even if I'm too tired to do that. She says, she will be fine
One night, as expected, she didn't react. I could play with and smell her hair, stroke her cheek, rest my head on her arm... Nothing. And her behaviour wouldn't change, she was still smiling, nice, not cold or resenting at all. She suggested going partying (that was our initial plan anyway, again, but I don't trust those thoughts under alcohol. I feared becoming 'that guy'
It seemed a lot like a date to me. It was the fourth time she spend time with me alone

She mentioned wanting to 'bro-zone' me, but won't react to anything. She still keeps coming to my place because 'she likes to be funny with me'. Every time I asked her about the attractiveness of someone she said ""[Factor] is nice, but nahhh, not really"". She pointed out some (edit: positive) factors that I *happen* to have.

Another note, she analyzes people thoroughly. Everytime you do something, she stops existing and analyzes you instead of responding. I believe she will never respond to anyone but a crush, should she ever have one.

I'd love to have a more intimate friendship with her (Edit: Even if it's just kissing, it's only been a few months since she broke up with her guy and I'm not sure she'd be a good match (I guess I don't know her well enough). Maybe it's that - She knows I'm not in for an LTR and wants to wait until I am? I don't feel like I'm being '-zoned' in any way, that confuses me.

EDIT: I've also read The Game and gone through the David Wygant mp3's as well as a few other various pickup resources like SimplePickup.

I've read Magic Bullets which helped me understand the process but I've only done 3 cold approachs (1 was a direct try for a number close with a HB6 and another was just a standard conversation, this was because I see her almost every day at the gym. The other was a girl I used to see at college but I only managed to get a few lines of dialogue before she ignored me after going straight direct, I think I waited too long in between replying and maybe should of just asked to hook up with her straight up.)

I look at her and I think she takes a look at me but I look away (yet to conquer this as well).  When I get up to the top, she saw me leave the platform and now I'm back again?  Isn't that weird?

But anyway

However, I'll kind of wait until it dissipates.  Perhaps this is all in my head but if anything, it might be practical too - don't you want to mitigate as much of a distraction or potential interference (however that might work) by others?  

So now I'm sitting here totally fucking regretting not just simply going for it.  The train eventually came and she and the guy next to her both got in the train (separately), and it actually seemed like it wouldn't have been so bad, even if the guy was there witnessing it since my strategy at that point might have been to come from a place of comfort rather than straight on direct approach; so the guy might not even consider it to be that embarrassing for me or snicker at my loser status having been potentially rejected by her (I'm never too sure of my odds and I'm not batting a great average).  Sucks that I actually care what he or the others might think of me but this is an area that prevents me from doing anything, like tonight.  So yea, the entire way back home until now (and likely tomorrow), I'm going to be obsessing on this and kicking myself repeatedly for not having the guts to just do it.  Fuck.

As soon as I logged in, underweight and pretty much the definition of beta. A lot changed in the past 3 years. I now have a career in software development, so I've been lurking on seddit quite a bit. Anyways

  

So she messages me and we start catching up. Apparently she dumped her boyfriend of 4 years about a month and a half ago. Nice. So I tell her that since she suddenly reappeared after 3 years in the limbs we had to see each other and catch up. She agrees. She even wants to do this now. Mind you it was 10:30pm and I was getting ready for bed. I consult my roommates quickly and they tell me that they will kick my ass if I don't see her tonight. Fair enough. So she comes to my place

  

So we get there and I order some drinks. She pays for the first round while I was away withdrawing some cash and she sits at the bar. We start talking and the conversation is great. I start touching her arms and shoulders when it's appropriate. She does not flinch. She also touches me. She then mentions that she started kickboxing. She demonstrates where to hit by touching my ribs. She then demonstrates how to take down somebody by wrapping her leg around mine then grabbing my arms (All of this while sitting on barstools). So at this point I'm pretty confident she digs me. She then mentions that it was the first time she wasn't carded. So I wrap my arm around her and jokingly whisper in her ear to not say that out loud since we were at a 25+ bar and she's 20. Again

  

So I get home and start to stress. We get out of the car and she walks to her car. Well I guess she's not coming with me in my bedroom. Fuck. I should not have gave her a tour of the house at the begining. Now would have been a good moment. Anyways

  

Anyways this is where I am seddit. I need advice on where to go on from now. Did I fuck this up at the end? Did I do good? When should I text her? She mentionned she would be busy until saturday hence why she wanted to see me right now.

Anyways I always see this guy working out and he is totally my type. The cliche tall

He always works out alone but there was one time where there was another woman working out with him. He was helping her with lifting weights/form. I look at him from time to time and at one point I saw her evilly glaring at me. I thought it was funny but I understand that it might be his girlfriend. He wasn't acting like they were a couple however he did leave with her (they weren't walking closely together). I hope she is just a friend. 

My question is where do I go from here? He seems preoccupied by working out or is managing his playlist on his phone. I understand most people just go to the gym to work out. Do I still try to speak with him whenever I can? I want to be able to exchange numbers and/or Facebook profiles with him without seeming desperate.

Got in touch with her maybe a week later due to having other things to do (ie. spinning plates, and made a jokey reference to something we talked about.  She gets back to me the next day and asks what I'm up to.  We converse back and forth for just a little bit to make plans - basically, everything is progressing nicely, no major delays in communication.

We meet for our date and it goes *incredibly* well.  We have a lot in common, I finger her, she strokes my cock for a little while, and then of course LMR.  I'm never great with LMR and she was pretty adamant that she had to get up early the next morning and couldn't stay.  So fine.. she says she'll text me and then I ask her which day she won't have have an early morning.  She says Monday.  So I say ok, Sunday should work and I think I remember her more or less agreeing.  Either way, that set it up so that Sunday would be the likely day we'd see each other next (This night was Wednesday).  I have absolutely no reason to worry that I won't see her again since we were so into each other all night.  

Wrong.. I text her an hour later and ask if she got home ok.  No reply.  I text her two days later, ""Enjoying the lovely weather?"" - referring of course to the snow storm we had recently, of which Friday was the worst.  No reply.  Sunday, the day we had pretty much more or less set up as the potential day when we'd see each other again, is coming up.  So instead of texting her on Saturday to make those plans concrete, I do it the same day on Sunday (about 11am) because I had already texted her the day before (weather text on Friday) and didn't want to over-text.  So on Sunday, I say, free to hang out tonight?  I remember that you said you had no morning appointment on Monday so Sunday evening should work.""  No reply.  

So what the hell?  What am I supposed to do?  I have no reason to believe at all that she isn't into me.  It makes no sense.  I was thinking of texting later in the week, everything ok?  Didn't get hit by a [reference], did you? :)""  [reference] being a humorous reference to something we had chatted about last.  I'm just not getting why she's not getting back.

She's *that* girl.  The one I may have always had a chance with, there was always something in the way of us dating.  At the end of our senior year, I kinda asked her out, but never followed up (stupid, I know...) and she ended up dating a mutual friend for like a year.  When her and that friend broke up, I asked her out to coffee; she said yes.  However, when I followed up



That was about a year ago.  Now, she seemed genuinely excited to hear from me.  Not falling out of her chair, but more attentive than your average instant messenger.  According to her, she was extremely sick when I called her the first time, and was too embarrassed about flaking on me to ever respond.

sarah is slightly more outgoing, she's very aware of the things i do to an odd level..she's the ""sexy"" bad girl(not my type, but I didn't know it back then)..

amy is more of a quite down to earth girl you can trust

sarah was more assertive and texted me first so i just assumed she was more interested and i hit on her and just replied to amy when she texted me way later on. I assumed they had a talk about me and one chose...but it seems they didn't.

They ask me to hang out

At first I keep attention on both of them, and we make comments about being couples and being married. we havent been one on one or kissed.

So I was at the gym today doing my own thing when my friend introduces me to an HB10, cutest face. We made small talk like where she's from, what she does, interview questions and whatnot. Somehow we got into talking about what kind of guy she digs and what kind of person she dates, saying how she doesn't date anyone younger than her (I'm 21, she's 26; shit test?). I busted some jokes here and there, gave her shit for stupid shit and she said that I'm a funny guy. We smiled at each other a lot and kept eye contact throughout the conversation. We talked for about an hour.

What makes me kind of confused is that she says shes a good girl, but she talks dirty and cusses a lot. I asked her if she wanted to work out together next time around and she responded in this sexual tone, ""Sure, let's 'WORK OUT' together (*wink and a cute little body roll)."" But being beta as fuck, I corrected her by saying, ""No I'm serious, let's actually work out together!""

How do you respond when trying to set up a meeting with a girl, she will pretty much always sound playful and teasing, whether she wants it to be a date or not. The fact that she's even asking could mean that she's worried and doesn't want it to be a date, but assuming attraction means she's feeling attracted and is hopeful that it is.

I've tried going with the ""no its not, like (cocky/funny) ""yeah i figured you would want to get to know me before we get married and have kids"", or ""yeah we'll have a candlelit dinner on my yacht, I'll read you some poetry, then we'll head out for some tango and salsa dancing.""

Or I guess I could go with something along the idea of ""Ew of course it's not a date! You're soooooo hideous why would anyone want to date you?"" (But i think for this response, not a real one.

Since I'm moving to school soon, early 20's and very petite. When I came in for my appointment, she had a little bit bigger smile that usual as a greeting. We had our normal conversation (light personal stuff, chit chat) then offhandedly she asks if I was doing anything fun that night. I remember it because she hasn't asked anything like that before. I thought about it and said no. Then I ask if she was doing anything in just a conversational manner and she sighed and said, ""No, not really"" or something like that. 

It wasn't until after I had left it hit me that was a great opportunity. It was like she was practically asking me out. I've had this situation happen before and I always realize what happened after it is too late. My question is how can you be ready for the unexpected? How do you not kick yourself after the fact? Am I making too much out of this encounter? It's frustrating because it feels like (another) missed opportunity.

1)  32-38 year old lawyer.  pretty girl

2)  26 year old law intern- talked to her for 10 minutes. kinda boring conversation

3) 8/10's- i opened with an acquatance and talked for a bit with one and she kinda turned her shoulder towards me a bit  and looked at her friend and my acquatance after 5 minutes. when i combiend this with her being 7ish years older than me

4)  6/10 party girls- opened and went well for 20 minutes. then kinda faded... as i couldnt sustain

5)  bulgarian girls- opened went well for 20 mintues but i couldnt tell if it was disinterest or language barrier that was making it harder to talk towards the end of the 20 minutes.

i opened them again later and they were somewhat warm again

6) 6/10 blonde- went well for 20-30  minutes. she went to get a drink and this random guy hit on her and got her number within 4 minutes.

she came back and said ""she was leaving but had a nice time meeting us and hoped to see us around again..."" i feel like this was her possibly trying to get me to ask for number.  i didnt because she was very very borderline on what id do looks wise and the random guy getting her number turned that into a no

7) 6.5/10 country girl- her friend was 250 lbs. the 6.5 was very country so i ejected as im not into country girls unless they are southern.

8)  5/10 at bar- got shot down immediately lol

9) 37 year old- talked to her for 30 minutes and went well. but she was 37 so i just said had fun and left.  felt 0 reason to ask for number. she was very attractive for her age

10) 8/10 punk rock- talked to her for 10 minutes and she felt like tense. but wouldnt leave lol. so i said id let her get to it with her friend and left.

then i hit on the 37 year old above

11)  super drunk party girl- got shot down immediately while she danced all over every other guy lol. was kinda confidecne debooster

12)  7/10 30-36 year old ish-  she was at a table with 2 guys who obviously werent dating her. so i went and sat down next to her and talked for 30 minutes and it was a good talk.  so i asked for her number and she said she was kinda seeing someone.

idk if she was legit or not.  idk why she would talk for 30 minutes though if she wasnt single

13)  married puerto rican girl- didnt know she was married.  but she kept talkign to me after i started so i regreted it

14) blonde college girl- instant shut down

15) 7/10 party girl-  walked up to her and started talking and her friend just stared at me like i was raping babies lol. she was friendly but awkward as her friend did not want me there and wasnt friendly when i tried bringign her in the conversation. so i left quite quickly",,t5_2s7xh,1374678530.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/askseddit/comments/1iyh6s/made_15_approaches_last_saturday_night_log_of/

I was a hermit for most of my life. And while my close knit group of friends have tons of friends, I'm not great at it, as I sometimes shut down if I feel like theres no connection, or If I run out of things to say, but I know practice makes perfect. I also have never been in an official relationship. A handful of flings, but never made it past that. So here is my question:

In an area where everyone knows everyone, if you will. I never thought that concept would pass highschool, but I'm now out of college and realizing it is a thing. When meeting a stranger, I can charm them with conversation and confidence and all that jazz, however when dealing with a girl who knows you somewhat, what are the appropriate steps to take?

This is what she said to me.

1. I don't know what I'm really getting myself into and that scares her. 

2. Sex is a big thing for her

3. She thinks after I have sex with her I'm going to want something ""new"" somwhere down the line. I took that as hitting it and quitting it. 

Now I now she wants to do it. The attraction is still very strong. I was very confident around her, and the way she was looking at me.... my god I couldn't contain myself. 

I just don't know how to escalate farther and put these thoughts out of her head. I definitely think she was testing me a little bit

Update: So I really took what you all had to say into consideration and took it seriously. After a lot of thinking you were all right. 

I told her I wanted to meet up and talk tomorrow in person. She wanted to hear what I had to say over text as in she didn't want to have to ""go through all that"". That there kind of solidified how she really felt about me and what I should do. 

She did ask a lot of question when we first started talking, but I tried and my best for her. That is what I think she meant by ""having to go through all that"" and describing me as frustrating. Idk maybe I am a little bit, but I'm not perfect.

I went on 3 dates with this girl. First date we had tons of fun and good chemistry and made out, she was on top and I felt her..she was very hot down there, and third date she would only kiss me a few times and wouldn't let me do more.

I tried to ask her to watch a movie at her place but she said she didn't like movies. I want to be in a private place together somewhere...

She's quite(but not awkward) and doesn't talk much so sometimes I feel like she might not even like me. I tried to connect with her emotionally and on various levels but it seems nothing is work.

I was kissing her on our third date and after lots of trying...we kissed a few times only

She tends to hide her motivations and what she feels. I asked her if she wasn't comfortable with kissing or something and she said something along the lines of we could do that later because we're going to see each other again anyway. 

She still wants to go on dates but I feel like the chemistry is dying here since I feel like our relationship isn't moving foreword emotionally or physically

I have no idea what she wants. I tried asking her if she knew what she was looking for currently

She's not a virgin and has had a couple of boyfriends and is dating other men. so what's going on?

- she suggest we go and get a free sausage sandwich, after we have the sandwich's in hand we go sit down, and continue to talk, here I get her to talk about what she does (work wise, and what she wants to be) and she continues the conversation till the point where she is practically 5 minutes late for a tutorial, I get her number, send her a txt

I started reading Magic Bullets and it's got good advice and all but my main problem is AA.

I look around for AA posts and think to myself 'Why are there so few posts and so few AA resources in general?'. Then I realise it must be that A-AA is not something someone can teach you

I can pump myself up when on the internet and get all the information I need to go and just start approaching, don't have to worry about anything bad happening and I can live in my little bubble.

But then after it's all said done I come home and think 'Not approaching is BORING'

Don't get me wrong, it's just the outcome. I'm scared of what'll happen next. Not even if I get rejected, I'm just scared some big fucker of a boyfriend will come up behind me and paralyse me, or she'll slap me, or she'll be real rude and embarrass me.  Because I don't mind about actually getting a girlfriend, rejection doesn't phase me. I'd much rather be able to simply approach and get rejected every time but not get embarrased/physically hurt rather than not approach at all.

I'm going to university after Summer and I think to myself 'It'll be different then'

Don't get me wrong, it's just normally having that confidence to do something like approaching brings with it a confidence to think of things to say quicker and make conversations flow. I find it difficult to think of things to say sometimes, not because I'm nervous, just cause I don't have a crap-ton of conversation-ammo in my armory.

I could continually try to pump myself up and try to approach but I know I'll probably be stuck in this cycle forever and I'll never get out of it.

Okay so on Friday night I went out and I ran into a beautiful girl that I know that is friends with my friend. As the night progressed we ended up coming back to my place for after party and her and I were the only ones there for the time being. To kill time we start fooling around. Now, she invited me out again. I told her I might end up that way, and at the end of the night a couple friends and I head over. Her and I start kino-ing almost immediately and we joke a bit, but I don't feel as on my game because frankly, I was tired. I grab her legs, she grabs my hand, but it doesn't escalate too much because her friends are around and they don't really know me. I didn't hover around her, my phone is dead and they are gone. Shit. So I walk to my car

Next day, I'd like to get her ramped up again and I was thinking a little playful texting with suggesting her getting a valentine and sending a picture of a cat asking to be her valentine or something (she doesn't like cats). I just don't want to come off as needy and texting her all the time, but I still want to keep her interest.

As I said we have been texting a lot recently so it could be too much.

 She's been sick off and on recently and I planned on asking her out tonight. So I was talking to her, as usual. Found out she's still sick (this was discussed unrelated to anything about hanging out and was just part of an average conversation). I didn't realize she was still sick. I then thought to myself ""well shit, I was going to ask her out"" so I decided to go ahead and say that I know she's sick but wanted to know if she wanted to go out after she was no longer sick. (I didn't just say ""go out"" though, I said some specific activity, and used ""with me"".  

She replies ""Yeah idk when ill be better though!"" 
I tell her to feel better so we can hangout with a little smiley face thing
She delays a little while to respond then says ""For sure

So I'm assuming that's a no for a few reasons. As far her first reply, there was a little bit of a delayed response and she didn't seem extra happy or anything about it. I'm thinking it's possible that she might just be too nice to actually say no.

I go to some venues and they are just way too loud. I know I've been told to learn to communicate in loud venues. **But its damn near impossible.** Some places I go


Also I am hearing varied and conflicting information and I'm not sure about certain things and would like clarification:

- It seems people go to clubs to dance to loud music, not to meet new people - with the exception of 1 night stands (if they are especially drunk)


Also I'm not having much success with my approaches. I'm at about 50 approaches. This is what I've noticed:


(1) Sometimes the guy shuts you down really quickly. For example:
Me: Opinion opener
Guy: **NEVER**


Or

Or
(2) Either the girl or the entire group doesn't hear your opener in the first place because its too damn loud


(3) Girls give stare of death like why is this idiot talking to us and what does he want. This despite use of a FTC


(4) Girl straight up ignores you, after getting their attention but BEFORE even delivering the opener.



Like ""Hey


(5) Girl gives extremely disinterested answer like ""I don't know."" or ""We're stupid. We don't know"".


One time I used the opener ""what's a good name for a 3-legged cat"" (I think got that from one of Strauss' reading materials) to a group two girls and they were like ""3-legged cat? As in you're trying to get in our cab?"". I didn't know what to say next.

I'm 23 and starting up my second year of University. I've been reading seddit and working on getting myself into a good state of mind since my last relationship ended. I've never really been good at approaching women

**First Day Back**
It's my first night back and some old friends let me know about a kegger going on nearby. I haven't been to a college party in awhile, I hold and she comes over to introduce herself to me.
We chat a bit about majors and stuff
We head to a decent bar where I end up dancing and chatting up the bartender after she brings me ice while I'm on the dance floor. No close but had a nice time

**A Few Nights Later**
Head out to a ""Black Out Party"" at a bar. Basically wear black clothes. Super fancy right? Same group of friends, but she tells me she wants me to have her number anyway as her friends are getting her to leave. Texted her for a bit but A)I have no texting game and B)I'm not out to start a relationship, much less a long distance one. 

Feel great and really helping with the outcome independence mindset. Still have some heavy AA issues

**Campus bar bummer**
I don't know what happened here

**Fraternity Social**
Prior to deciding to go out tonight
A fraternity I'm rushing with some friends is hosting a social bbq/kegger. Decide to show up as it's a good time to try to make an impression and hopefully fall into an organization that'll help me be more social (another thing I'm really working on). Get there and play games with the guys. Ladies start filtering in way after we get started
End up opening a 2-set, but loudly introduce myself to her friends when they come back.
One noise complaint later and they need a bunch of us to vacate. Someone comes around and lets everyone know about a party going on nearby we can all shift to, we find out her friend is going back to her dorm, but HB8 is still down to party. Before we get too far the friend begins panicking over the phone and insisting she come home. I decide to be a gentleman and walk her there. Some light kino goes on while we walk, and end up making out outside her friends dorm while we wait to be buzzed in. I hang out for a bit but she's visiting from a couple cities over so I decide to leave now that she's home safe and wish her a good night. Felt pretty good getting a K-close from a pretty lady and really reinforced some of the game that is spoken about here. Outcome independence once again reinforced, as was the abundance mindset.

**Epilogue**
I'm hoping I can maintain the positive emotion I have going on for next weekend, I thought, was way hotter than I had any right to. But I'm definitely finding that when I don't think that way, when I just go out and talk to the women I find attractive, I'm not out of my league. I'm a great catch and it's a lot of fun to meet new people, whether or not anything more comes of it.

1340557807.0,vj34b,Trouble in paradise,godfada99,14,2,7,"I went to college at one of America’s most libidinous universities in the midst of the accrual of football and basketball championships. I was with all my friends from high school and was hard drinking and class skippin’. I never got laid. I didn’t even make out with a girl. I was shy, and carried a proud 2-point-something GPA after graduating 20th in a class of 850. Before my junior year, fat

I got a job selling life insurance and everyone I knew thought I would be a natural at it. I hated it. I hated the long hours and the rah-rah-rah motivation. I let my contract expire and started lifeguarding at the local beach club. I had no stress. No expectations of anyone or anything. Under the tutelage of a member there, and grew strong and lean. I revived the A+ student I inherently am, tracking my meals and workouts, the amount of water I drank, and the amount of sleep I got (which I still do to this day). I studied food and exercise. In a short period of time I lost 80lbs and have kept them off for 3 years.

Some other positive stuff happened in my life, I even got laid once by a friend of a friend who asked “when did you decide to become a superhero?” after she saw the new me, but I essentially had no part in making it happen. I could open girls, just like people write, by saying “Hey!” or “Hi” and literally had nothing to say next. I couldn’t have told you my home address if I was asked because my brain felt so empty. I was going out 3-4 times a week and then stopped because just going out, being around girls was too demoralizing after a couple months. I felt like I was encased in glass walls wherever I went. When I tried to dig down and find my confidence, it wasn’t there. I didn’t even know what feeling I was looking for. Girls would tell me how their friends thought I was cute, but my reaction was/is always something like, “Yeah

In my circle of friends there was a guy who was as natural as the term implies. He was usually unemployed, always had a new girl with him. No wingmen, no tactics, just a revolving door. I admired and envied him for that, but he had nothing to teach. Recently I was at a boat party with mutual friends of the scummy guy (SG) and he brought out a pretty cute chick. She was funny and having a good time just being around SG, which I thought was a testament to the quality of his game. After we all left the yacht club, she climbed into her Porsche turbo, in my eyes, anger, worst of all

I’m really at a loss and to the point where, I stopped drinking and smoking cold turkey, I stopped eating unhealthy foods, I noFapped for a while, but that was so easy that I went to noPMO. I can stop doing anything, but can’t start doing anything. No book/blog/post can shove me at a girl, or at least give me a clue as to what should be rolling around in my empty brain and for that reason I think I probably need a coach to get started. Questions/thoughts? Interested parties?
 
Thanks to anyone who read this whole mess.

Tl;dr: Lived somewhere crappy, got new job. Can’t talk to girls.

I told myself I wouldn't squander another opportunity talk to an attractive girl.

I've never been in a relationship and I'm 27 years old. I've been lurking seddit and watched/read countless material on pick up for several months and haven't made much progress. Is there anyway I could approach at her booth again or should I just count it as a loss and move one?

I think this girl is dating another guy while still going out with me. She never mentioned a bf in all the contacts we have, etc.

1) What do I do? I don't know if I gain anything by asking if she is seeing someone.

2) If I do ask

Long version: 

This girl I have been pursuing have been going out alone with me to a couple of places. I have been using techniques and it seems to be working. (hard to tell since she shows mixed signals and combined with my inexperience
Here is some background: I been see this girl for a couple of months now. I fumble a bit during the first few contacts. i.e. I am not that experienced at picking up girls. Moreover
Here is why I made the assumption she was single:

1) I have not seen her with another guy. (Could be hard to say on this, she is bound to be walking with them sometimes)

2) Her phone's wallpaper does not have a picture of any guy. Just a cute picture of two bunnies? Is this a flagged I missed? People have told me to not over analyze things so I didn't on this one.

3) Finally she makes no reference to a boyfriend in our conversations. Even after I verbally expressed interested in her. I know it's not something I should have done. But I was noob back then. (just for FYI, she would say, ""Sorry I am already dating someone.""
We have been going out together lately to places (park and lunch). Then one day she refused an offer from me to take her out to lunch and when we do meet up for a study session
Should I confront her on this issue to verify my assumption? Or should I just play it as if she never mention a boyfriend

Again if I do ask

The only reason I ask is some people here say you should fail quickly and move on so you can get more practice and not to waste your time.

Her: ""Hi!"" I'm just going to ignore it for now. At least until tomorrow afternoon/night when I finish with all my finals. Then maybe I'll call her see whats her problem.**

**Question:** My gf never responded after I invited her out for a date. Should I just not respond and take this as a message that the relationships over or should I say something to officially end it? Nothing mean, maybe a subtle neg (shes narcissistic with low self-esteem so I wouldn't feel bad about this), enjoy life bye. Or should I just leave things the way they are now and just forget it completely? She went from hot to cold overnight. 

**Background for those interested:** I'm 21, calling me cute, sexy, handsome, sweet. Sometimes we would text back and forth bantering and inside jokes throughout the day. She would also respond quickly and apologize if she was late to respond. She always initiated text convos and kept them up. I never texted her if she didn't respond or expressed any type of neediness that I can think of. She invited me to meet her family, and we even displayed affection around them which she initiated. She was trying to persuade me to go out of the country just me and her to meet her extended family. She talked to me about taking class together next semester. Talked to me about future dates. Told me how much she wanted me to kiss her. Her siblings liked me. Everything seemed great. 

Then all that abruptly ended for some reason 3 weeks ago when she started to become busy. She attributed it to school which is understandable as we have finals and she has extra classes and works full time. She canceled prearranged plans with me which she already paid for. Didn't show up to class. She continued to text me occasionally but wasn't enthusiastic or responsive. After I would respond she would never say anything back even if I was alluding to an inside joke which was really odd behavior. Asked her if something was wrong she said no and even asked me why I would think that. This whole time I haven't seen her since she didn't show up to class which I assumed indicated she was seriously busy. I told her that I wouldn't text her since I know she's busy so whenever she becomes free again to let me know.  She didn't respond but continued to start convos that she wouldn't respond too or if she did was very kurt. Not sure why she didn't just take this as a queue to end it if she didn't want to talk to me. She would text me out of the blue how she was almost done with finals or she has XX finals left to go. 

Thought things were picking up though since school was ending. Emailed me a funny pic last week. She texted me that she finished all her finals on Monday night. I responded telling her how many I have left and asking hers went. She didn't respond until Tuesday morning. Apologized for taking too long to respond but said it was because she was sleeping. I never once called her out on her response time nor even indicated it bothered me but she would still always apologize. I text her and make a funny comment and she responds back immediately telling me how I'm hilarious. She was positive and responsive so I thought things were back to normal. Yesterday(Wednesday), who didn't drink alcohol or party. I really cant think of anything I could have done wrong. Last time we spent time together we were making out and talking and joking around.

Could it be so that people are drawn towards me when insecure as they don't know too many other people and that when they make more friends, they get sick of my excessive talking?

I think what I'll do is try to talk less about myself this weekend as see how it goes. If it goes well

**Other questions:**

* What's a good way to flirt

* I started smoking pot last summer and I notice it makes flirting much easier and the girls I talk to tend to become MUCH more comfortable with me. Could anyone explain this?

When we got back it was just me and her in my room and she was on my bed, saying that she really liked me and wanted us to have sex, while taking her clothes off. We were touching each other but I really wasn't that drunk and wasn't going to take advantage. I said I liked her too but that it should be more than ""a drunken thing"" and that we'd chat about it soon. Shortly after this she throws up all in my bed and apologises profusely. I take her to her room and put her to bed.

The next day after I had cleaned it all up, it was definitely still on between us.

However the day after that, but she barely responds. Basically, it seems really OFF with her now. Before whenever we'd see each other she'd come over, we'd hug and then flirt/banter a bit. Now it's just generic small talk and me starting the conversation.

She's told me I'm hot

She's BALLING out of god damn control, some fucking black kid (I'm the richest in my fam, but jesus), who would literally not be able to keep up.

While at school (She was like 2 floors above me) we would chill and she'd tell me about where she's going a certain weekend, (like, a date) to chill. Like this one night she said this guy was flying her out to Paris, and she was not going to hook up with him. Literally using the guy. And she does this often.

How the fuck do I compete with that, but she's a sick girl and honestly I'd be down to date. But I haven't ever even fucking left Canada so there's no way in hell I'd be able to do that shit. Open relationship I guess if anything lol. Her dads friends sons always trying to Woo her and shit. Fuck.

Then, lets hook up and bang the deed is done (Not necessarily that quick, but you know what I mean.) But one time I was just fooling around texting her (after I got circumcised, I couldn't do anything anyway) and she straight up said in a joking way ""You need to work on your game, haha"" I was blown away.

Before you read. Just know that I am not asking for beginner advice so read through.

Little background. I have been casually dating her for almost 2 months. 

So I met this girl. I knew she was interested

Now the kind of outings I take her on are not just any normal dates. I bring this girl to abandoned buildings, picnic adventures, I cook for her, ect ect... I am a very spontaneous person when I am with a pretty girl I like, there is no way she gets bored when we are doing stuff. I bite her when I want, grab her ass when I want, playfully push her when I want

She shit tests. I catch the obvious ones, acting uninterested... I may have missed some but I doubt it. there have been bigger shit tests like one time. We were exploring an abandoned building and we met this dude and we split up for about an hour I was doing my own thing... climbing shit, and taking picture. When we got out she told me she got to talk to him and it was so cool haha. So I say oh yeah? With the biggest smile on my face and she says yeah and changes subjects. This is were it gets good. She was with this guy, and my roommate the entire time I was away. my roomate/good friend told me after that she was quieter than normal when they were without me. 

last shit test was when we were hanging out in my room before an adventure she told me about this guy that asked for her number, and I/we forgot. 

This is where I need advice

She is always smiling

She has texted me before saying let's go wreck havoc.

She has said how it is so cool that we have not grown up in the same high school.

I do not know the word for this

She has texted during sex when when she was on top. 

She will check her phone and when it is in front of me I can see she has no texts. I know she is not looking at the time

So I expressed interest in a relationship a little bit ago

So she is out of town and she wants to take me to an event she got free tickets to when she gets back. 

It really frustrated me when she did not give me any answer.

So I have what I am going to say to her and I am going to say it to her. But I do not know the best time to say it. Like right when we meet up

Here is what I am going to tell her in person

Blank we need to talk. I feel like I am your tour bus guide that you are using to gain new experiences, I want you to know something about me. When I meet a pretty girl I either want to have sex with her. Or date her. Or have nothing to do with her. It is very rare me to want two of those from someone. I have not had all three emotions yet. Now back to why all of this is relevant. On (date) before you left for (blank) I expressed interest in a relationship. Ia that correct? I have the impression you want to be friends. Which is okay with me. (It really is not... But it will be my shit test). It really frustrates me that I do not understand your response. I want to know your opinion on this situation.

Sooooo too much? Not enough? Changes? Don't do it? Opinions? Advice?

There are a couple of girls from class that i always flirt with, and went back to the chair she was sitting before. 
I was fucking shocked, but fuck i didn't know what the hell to do. At this point in the afternoon me and my other friend were about to leave. I went to the bathroom, calmed my self and said: ""this is not staying like this, i gotta do something before i leave"". So i thought of doing the same thing to her before going. So that i tried, and failed as she just moved away and said ""you want to eat me alive?"". Of course i replied: ""i was just giving back your lick"". She said bye to my friend and she stood outside the door as i looked into her eyes and i said ""well this is how it's gonna be huh?"". She came closer grabbed my face and kissed me in the neck.

We've been somewhat in contact for TWO MONTHS. I've never had to move this slow.

Between our third date she started acting out, from work, to school, various things. I've never figured out why.

On our third date, with other girls I've dated we've moved very quickly.

She was and is dating another guy.

So after the third date we talked a little but I generally kept radio silent for a few weeks because I lost interest completely and she just wasn't putting forth any effort and I didn't feel like we were moving anywhere physically and emotionally. This was taking WAY too long. I've never had to date a girl for 2 months without the relationship moving foreword and just didn't feel like she even liked me. I felt like she was just bored with her life and wanted someone to take her out

-we're not progressing emotionally or physically

-moving too slow

She's very private because she ""doesn't like anyone knowing her"" despite me opening up. I even tried asking her what she was looking for(something casual, she gave me some very vague answer and basically I couldn't get anything out of her.

Shes told me that she wants to remain single for a year

We joked about being friends with benefits

1359411476.0,17gehq,Me and my friend like the same girl - what should I do?,capsfancam,11,0,25,"I've been in a class with this girl for just over a year now but we didn't talk much outside class, whilst seeing each other in school every day. My friend has also been texting her after I encouraged him (before I realised I liked her) and is meeting up with her this weekend. This caused a big argument between me and him

Some important points:

1) She hasn't seen him since the party - he lives quite far away
2) If I'm 100% neutral me and my friend are similar
3) Me and the girl are 17
4) He thinks she doesn't like me
5) He wants me to admit my attraction to her.



What do you guys think I should do? I really don't want to ruin my friendship with either of them

She's been asking to hang out all week and she gets excited when she sees me. *She actually just called me right as I was typing that sentence*.

I just haven't ever 'hit that' because I never really tried- I just kept it at flirting. 

**So should I treat tonight like a date and escalate in the movie theater?**

I'm a little worried that she'd be surprised. 

Thanks",,t5_2s7xh,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/askseddit/comments/1khs4w/girl_invited_me_to_movies_with_her_not_sure_if/
