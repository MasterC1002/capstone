God save me from some aspects of the MMO community. You people are impossible. You have ruined a ton of AAA games in the last few years - you DEMAND treadmill gated endgame, and you all bitch and whine because you can't **grind yourself to boredom** in a month like you have done with every other MMO.

You are destroying the viability of MMOs by being entitled impatient kids who can't make fun for yourself

You all keep acting like this, because they will simply not be profitable.

Maybe the problem isn't the MMO

Many of you will spend hours exploring the world in Skryim

Why can't we as an MMO community take the attitude we bring to FPS games

**We take the attitude of playing games for FUN in almost every other genre

I'd like to apologize for writing an earlier comment that cast doubt on his accomplishment. At the same time Surfeuze was racing to level 80, and when Surfeuze posted of his accomplishment, I mistakenly thought he was a player who had used that technique.

In fact he wasn't. Surfeuze played normal PvE content to level 60

When an account is blocked for a chat offense, in most cases, the account is also given a three-day suspension.

We have reviewed all the name suspensions currently in place. Where we could give some leeway, for substantially offensive names, we will keep the full three-day suspensions in effect.

In a few posts on Reddit and on fan forums, but the game does give a message that states the reason for the suspension. In every case we have double-checked, the action taken on the account was appropriate.

However, post your character name and we’ll reply in graphic detail with the reason for the block. Warning: NSFW ahead!

You can read our name policy [here](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/legal/guild-wars-2-naming-policy/). You can get a lot of good info about GW2 support policies in [this doc](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/legal/guild-wars-2-conduct-breaches-outcomes/).

**Account security** - We're seeing an uptick in reports of account theft and attempted account theft. We believe hackers are using databases of email addresses and passwords stolen from other games and web sites, we have temporarily disabled the ""reset password"" feature, and we're working to bring email authentication online. To protect yourself, please ensure that you use a unique password for *Guild Wars 2* that you don't use for any other game, email account, forum or web account.

**Email authentication** - Email authentication is a feature that notifies you if someone tries to log into your account from a location you've never logged in from before. Thus, such as [Google](https://support.google.com/accounts/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=185839&amp;topic=1056283&amp;ctx=topic) or [Yahoo](http://www.ymailblog.com/blog/2011/12/yahoo-introduces-stronger-user-authentication-%E2%80%93-second-sign-in-verification/), and taking advantage of that. We're currently preparing email authentication and intend to deploy it in a phased rollout, starting on Thursday, August 30.

**Parties, guilds, and other social features are periodically failing. This causes issues such as party members not appearing on the map, and party members not staying in the same overflow servers as they travel between maps. This happens particularly during times of peak usage. We're working to fix related problems and mitigate this issue with each subsequent update.

**Worlds** - Many worlds are filling up. We're keeping the number of worlds constrained so that worlds stay well populated even after the initial surge of high concurrency. However, all German language worlds are full and all French language worlds are at high usage, so we're adding two new German language worlds and one new French language world.

**Overflow worlds** - During this initial surge of high concurrency, but you’re not on the same overflow map, you can form a party together, then right-click on your friend's portrait in the party list and click ""join"". Note that this functionality is sometimes intermittently unavailable due to the ""parties, guilds, etc."" issues noted above.

**Trading Post** - We're working to bring the Trading Post back online. To help test

**Edit: We have completed our live testing of the Trading Post for today and the Trading Post is now in maintenance for all players. Thank you everyone that participated; this test has helped us tremendously.**

**In-game mail** - We detected a potential abuse of the in-game mail system and have temporarily disabled in-game mail to prevent any such abuse. We'll reenable it soon

**Edit: The fact that in-game mail is disabled means that it's currently impossible for account hackers to loot stolen accounts

**Botting** - We'll start substantial banning of bots on Wednesday, we will start with 72-hour bans for first offenses. In the coming days, as we address the casual botting problem, we plan to switch to our normal policy of permanently banning anyone who runs a bot.

**Forums** - Our most important priority at the moment is to ensure that the game runs stably and flawlessly. So as to not create additional demand on our infrastructure and on our programming team

**Next software updates** - The next update of the game server and back-end server software will take place tonight at midnight Seattle time. The game may be unavailable for approximately 20-60 minutes while we perform the update. We expect this update to have fixes for email authentication and in-game mail. Our continued work on the Trading Post is not tied to game updates

1346165913.0,yyp9y,Anti-Fun Issues Discovered During Head Start and Proposed Solutions,proteininja,2070,639,650,"Some of these issues are already on the front page

* **Problem #1:** Having the ""f"" key perform all actions creates a great deal of frustration when many different action types occupy the same space.

*Solution #1:* Split up actions in the keybinds. Allow users to assign the same key to all actions or different keys to each.

* **Problem #2:** Withdrawing items from the collection for crafting is tedious.

*Solution #2:* Allow crafting items to be used directly from the collection and bank. Alternatively

* **Problem #3:** Items in the collection cannot directly be added to mail. This adds an unnecessary step when trying to send materials to friends.

*Solution #3:* Add ""Send mail to..."" to the context menu of items in the collection

* **Problem #4:** When attempting to send mail to a contact

*Solution #4:* Add auto-completion to the ""To:"" field that includes contacts

* **Problem #5:** When a party member is logged out

*Solution #5:* Enable the ""Send mail to..."" option regardless of party members' online status.

* **Problem #6:** Quest related items that cannot be sold or salvaged appear too similar to some junk trophies.

*Solution #6:* Label these items

* **Problem #7:** Some pet abilities feel unresponsive and do not activate on the first attempt.

*Solution #7:* Give the player feedback when they attempt to activate an ability for their pet and that ability will never be executed. (ex. pet too far away from target)

* **Problem #8:** When a player first chooses which utility skills will fill their slots

*Solution #8:* When a player first fills a utility slot and the opposite land/water slot is empty

* **Problem #9:** Players are unable to edit their underwater utility skills unless they are underwater. This is a problem because underwater areas in Tyria are rarely ""safe"" and as a result are not conducive to considering and assigning skills.

*Solution #9:* Allow the player to edit underwater utility choice while on land.

* **Problem #10:** Unlike other weapon and utility skills

*Solution #10* Flesh out the skill tool tips where necessary

* **Problem #11:** New players are unable to read and consider downed abilities prior to being downed. The frantic nature of the downed state does not usually allow enough time for careful reading of abilities. This problem also extends to other conditional skills such as necromancer wraith form.

*Solution #11:* Provide a method for new players to calmly read and consider their downed abilities and conditional class abilities outside of combat.

* **Problem #12:** After double clicking a salvage kit

*Solution #12:* Do not remove the salvage cursor when using the inventory scroll bar.

* **Problem #13:** When hovering over and item in preparation for salvaging it

*Solution #13:* Add a comparison to current weapons and armor on hover when the salvaging cursor is active.

* **Problem #14:** The player must hover over each recently acquired item in their inventory when choosing what to salvage in order to see if the item is salvageable or not.

*Solution #14:* Upon double clicking the salvage kit

* **Problem #15:** If an engineer wishes to set an ability in their weapon kit to be an auto attack

*Solution #15:* Remember auto-attack selection for weapon kits and other temporary weapons (such as the elementalist's lightning hammer)

* **Problem #16:** When salvaging a rare item

*Solution #16:* Keep the salvage cursor active after selecting your choice on the confirmation dialogue.

**TLDR; I got 99 problems

**Edit #1:** I'm going out for lunch. Please continue leaving comments and I will go through them when I return.

**Edit #2:** Back from lunch. 121 comments to sift through. Updates soon. As a reminder this post is for listing features that are working as intended

**Edit #3:** There is officially no hope of getting through this growing list of comments. I feel I captured the few remaining issues that myself and others experienced. Thank you for your input and for putting this where A-Net may read it. Hopefully your help will make this game the most fun it can possibly be. Also

**Edit #4:** I'm done adding issues to the list. I fixed formatting to make it easier on A-Net to read. *crosses fingers* 

**Edit #5:** I received quite a few comments in regard to the minor nature of these issues and how it is not worth it to discuss them. I am going to use one of my replies from below to address all of these individuals.

&gt; If you haven't figured out the connection between all of these ideas

&gt; A pebble in your shoe is a very small problem. If you walk 10 miles it is an annoyance. If you walk 100 miles it can be a huge issue. I'm just trying to help arena net take out the pebbles early on before anyone really notices.

**Edit #6:** Some commentors have taken issue with my use of the term ""anti-fun"". I define ""anti-fun issues"" as any issue that detracts from the fun of the game. I do not think these things make the game completely un-fun. They simply detract from fun things and make them slightly less fun.

  A.  If he sees another player

While playing WvWvW tonight against Yak's Bend and Northern Shiverpeaks

So far, one of the major guilds on Yak's Bend. Turns out that they were as bothered by the cheating as we were, and they wanted to make amends in the best way that they could.

Yak's Bend, we in turn left Ascension Bay immediately after capturing the point so that the zerg from Yak's Bend could take the keep back. Aside from a few pugs, not a single attack took place from either server while this exchange took place. It was quite possibly one of the most impressive things I've seen since this game came out.

I would like to thank Yak's Bend for suggesting this exchange

1347291264.0,znn4y,All my knowledge - Part 1,koranuso,1528,394,113,"**UPDATED 9-11-12**

*I haven't really decided what to make this into yet. After 200+ hours ingame my head is chock full of tidbits that a lot of people don't seem to know. My goal is to educate and maybe bring light to certain confusing aspects of the game. If people like it I will make more parts. If people don't like it I'll probably still make more parts. Enjoy.*

**Basic knowledge:**

**1. Using Lion's Arch as a hub.**

 Lions arch is a town that is unique in the fact that it has portals (those purple swirly things on map) to each of the 5 races major cities. What makes this useful is that from anywhere in the world you can open up your Hero panel

*Note: If you have never entered the mists before

**2. Crafting gives you experience based on a % of your current level.**

 Every crafting discipline will give you 10 level if you max it to 400 no matter when you start it. If you start it at level 1, no matter what that may be. 

From 1-100 crafting skill you gain 1% of a total level in xp (i.e. you will gain 1 level from this crafting)

From 101-200 crafting skill you gain 2% of a total level in xp (i.e. you will gain 2 levels from this crafting)

From 2001-300 crafting skill you gain 3% of a total level in xp (i.e. you will gain 3 levels from this crafting)

From 301-400 crafting skill you gain 4% of a total level in xp (i.e. you will gain 4 levels from this crafting)

*NOTE: Crafting is fun and certainly useful if you are solo. It is not a great way to make money. The odds of the average person recouping their investment is very low with the state of the economy the way it is. I will go more in depth on this later.*

**3. How to get gold.**

 I have made gold pretty much every way available and I keep coming back to the same method. Stack magic find and sell everything. Now the my advice varies based on level so let's look at the three categories of people.

 **Before level 70:** Prior to this level don't worry about magic find. Simply sell every single piece of gear you find at the vendor. Salvage (with BASIC kits) only those items that say they are specifically for salvage. As you will quickly learn

 **After level 70:** This is where it gets good. Continue to follow the strategy above, I will get at least one Yellow (Rare) quality item. Why would you want these level 70+ yellows? Because when you use a MASTER or MYSTIC salvage kit on them, there is a very good chance you will get a Glob of Ectoplasm (about 18s item) from them along with whatever sigil or rune they have in them. ONLY level 70+ yellows give Globs of Ectoplasm. These Ectos are used to craft Orange (Exotic) gear at level 80 and you need about 35 to make a full set when you are 80. 

**Mystic Salvage Kit Recipe:** One each of yellow

This salvage kit has the same recovery rate as the Master but has 250 uses instead of 25. If you Salvage a lot of 70+ yellow it if far more cost effective to use these than to purchase Master Salvage kits. You can Acquire the forge stone from the Black Lion gem shop. I purchases 450 gems for 1g 18s in order to get a set of 10 stones. Then I made myself 3 of these kits. They are account bound and thus can be shared among all your alts.

**NOTE: There has been a shift in the market due to this post. It is now more profitable to only salvage 70+ yellows IF they are not part of the Traveler's MF set. Be sure to check the TP first for prices and if the yellow you have is going for more than 40 silver
 
**4. How to get gear.**

 NEVER BUY. ALWAYS OFFER. Those words are true enough for me to consider them law. I have noticed people (read assholes) really taking advantage of new people. Let me describe what is happening. When I make a character and get him to say level 10

Search item: Mighty (Because at low levels power rocks)

Level range: 10 to 10

Quality: Fine (Blue)

Category: Armor and then I do again for Weapons and Jewelry

 If you do this you will notice that level 10 Blue gear is going for anywhere from 2 silver to 5 silver a piece. These items are worth 17-24 COPPER. Anyone that sells the gear for an appropriate amount has their gear bought and relisted immediately at the much higher price. Now you can combat this very easily. 

 When you see an item you like (or more likely you want a set if you upgrade every 10 levels like I do)

 These offers I place always get filled within 10 minutes. There is no need to pay more than a few silver for a full set of lowbie Blue gear. Repeat this process every 5-10 levels and you will feel very overpowered for the level of content you are in. And since you are selling every piece of gear you find to vendor you will be able to EASILY fund this.

*There is a slight exception to this rule. At low levels you can salvage cloth and weapons into Jute scraps and Copper ore. These two materials go for a significant amount (around 20c each) on the TP. If you want to try your hand at selling on the TP to make a little extra coin you can try salvaging those items. Once you start getting iron and wool though I would go back to vendoring. Iron and wool go for about 6c each on the TP.*


**5. Selling on the Trading Post.**

 Selling stuff on the TP is not free. When you put something up for auction you incur an immediate 5% fee of whatever you set the selling price as. IF the item sells you will incur an additional 10% fee on the selling price as well. If you pull your item off the TP in order to relist it because someone maybe undercut you

 It is very easy for you to lose money if you are not mindful of these percentages. 


*Ok

I'll be using GBP as the pricing for this

**So
The game costs £49.99 directly from Arenanet. (The cheapest I've found is about £35~
800 gems are £8.50.    
A bank slot is 600 gems.   
A character slot is 800 gems.    

**Therefore.**
5 character slots and a bank slot is 4600. That's £48.75. However

5 character slots and a bank slot is £51.   
A full account is £49.99.   

**EVEN MORE SO

A bag slot is 400 gems and awards you 8-20 (I think?) inventory slots. A bank slot is 600 gems and awards you 30 inventory space.    
A character slot is 800 gems and awards you 20 inventory space with 4 free slots for bags (which can be filled with 8 slots very easily)

**SO
For a bag slot: 50 gems per inventory slot to start with
For a bank slot: 20 gems per inventory slot.     
For a character slot: 40 gems per inventory slot to start with, to 8 gems per inventory slot.   

Obviously you also have the ability to play on that character

I'm sure everyone can see that there're major issues in the pricing. The gem shop items cost FAR too much for what they offer.

**Trace the IP**

So, which as it turns out, provides VPN service. One of their VPN servers is in, you guessed it, San Fransisco. I searched the hosts contact information and shot them an email.

This morning I got an email from the service provider that the account using the VPN to try to access my GW2 account has now been terminated.

**Account security** - Hackers are systematically scanning email addresses and passwords harvested from other games, listed below, but we need your help too. To protect your account, make sure you use a strong, unique password for *Guild Wars 2* that you've never used anywhere else. If your password isn't strong and unique, change it right now. For the highest level of protection, also create a unique email address to use solely for *Guild Wars 2*.

Here are the things we're doing to protect your accounts.

* We have the ""password reset"" feature temporarily disabled. If you need to reset your password

* We now have email authentication turned on for all players with verified email addresses. With this feature, you'll have an opportunity to approve or disapprove of the login through an email check.

* We've noticed that hackers who discover a working email address and password combination don't always immediately exploit the compromised account. We sent email to everyone whose account has been suspiciously logged into asking them to immediately change their email address and password.

* We will also be sending email to all customers whose accounts have been unsuccessfully tested by hackers. We strongly recommend that these customers create a new

* We left in-game mail disabled for another half-day, so we ask everyone to quickly secure their accounts.

**Email authentication** - We started ramping up email authentication after last night's server update

**Parties, guilds, and other social features, which cause symptoms such as party members not appearing on the map, party members not staying in the same overflow servers as they travel between maps, and guild invites and guild chat failing intermittently.

**Overflow servers** - During this initial surge of high concurrency, but you're not on the same overflow servers, you can form a party together, then right-click on your friend's portrait in the party list and click ""join"". Note that this functionality is sometimes intermittently unavailable due to the issues with parties and guilds noted above.

We expect the use of overflow servers to naturally subside as players spread out more through the world.

**Botting** - Yesterday we applied 72-hour account suspensions to 500 players who were running bots. We're continuing to detect and ban bots. Soon we will ramp up to our normal policy of applying permanent account bans to anyone who runs a bot.

**Exploits** - If you discover an exploit in the game

This morning there was a widely-publicized, and did not exploit it. However, a smaller group of players did significantly exploit it, each purchasing hundreds or thousands of these weapons. We permanently banned 3,000 accounts of players who substantially exploited it, and applied 72-hours bans to another 1,000 accounts of players who mildly exploited it.

**In-game mail** - In last night's software update we fixed the potential abuse of the in-game mail system that we identified yesterday. We kept in-game mail turned off for another half-day while working to secure accounts against hackers

**Trading Post** - Yesterday we tested Trading Post with a random 15% of players. This test helped us gather valuable data to fix important bottlenecks. This afternoon we will test Trading Post with a random 25% of players

**Tournament Rewards** - We're working on fixing tournament chest rewards. Because this requires substantial testing

**Forums** - Our most important priority at the moment is to ensure that the game runs stably and flawlessly. So as to not create additional demand on our infrastructure and on our programming team

**Next software updates** - We're making non-disruptive changes throughout the day. We'll publish the next back-end server update tonight at midnight Seattle time. The game may be unavailable for approximately 20-60 minutes while we perform this update.

1347304945.0,zo0uj,All my knowledge - Part 4,koranuso,1498,410,204,"**UPDATED 9-13-12**

 So you've hit level 80 and have no idea what to do. Don't feel bad. When I finally got to Orr at 80 I was wearing level 60-70 greens and getting stomped repeatedly by every friggin Risen I met.

Here is my progression.

**1. Fresh level 80.**

 Go on the TP and purchase a full set of level 80 Yellow Travellers (magic find set) gear. Weapons also come in Travelers types. Due to the recent market shift

5/6 Superior rune of the Pirate
1/6 Superior rune of the Traveler

Or vice versa works too. I just like the bonuses to Might since I'm a warrior.

Now buy a level 80 Sigil of Luck and add it to your weapon(s). 

*NOTE: If you dual wield

 Too finish up

 All told you will spend around who the hell knows anymore gold which isn't too bad for that level especially if you have just been selling all your gear and not paying a bunch of money to learn crafting.

**2. Exotics.**

 Now you have a full yellow MF set which with food should give you about the same MF% as me. You have a couple options now. 

**A.** You can make an [Exotic MF set of glass cannon gear](http://i.imgur.com/cMxEE.jpg). (That's what I did but considering you have the yellow set for that

**B.** You can make your exotic dungeon/pve/pvp set of gear. (I'm working on this now.)

Here is the reason why I went with Option A first.

 I used my yellow mf set of gear to farm the events in Orr (I get about 1 yellow at least each event) and I also cleared every level 70+ zone in the game (there are only like 4). The completion rewards for the 70+ zones are level 70+ yellows and exotics. I didn't wear and of those of course

 Aside from that I made sure to MINE EVERY SINGLE ORICHALCUM ORE (and Orrian Sapling). They are very expensive and quite rare. Even if I had to go outta my way I was sure to snag all I could see. 

 When I had close to enough materials for the Exotic armor

 Below is a list of materials needed for a full 6 piece set of HEAVY Exotic Armor. The data comes from GW2DB.com but is very difficult to tabulate with the way they have stuff laid out. 

**Draconic Set**

30x Globs of Ectoplasm

37x Bolts of Gossamer **OR** 74x Gossamer Scraps

120x Spools of Gossamer Thread (from Tailoring vendor)

16x Orichalcum Ingots **OR** 32x Orichalcum Ore

30x Vicious Claws

 The Vicious Claws can be replaced with any rare material of the same Tier. That rare material is what determines the stats that will appear on the final crafted gear. In the case of Vicious Claws it gives power/precision/mf.

 Weapons are pretty similar but there is too much variance in mats for me to list everything

 As far as jewelry...fuck Exotics. Seriously. You get 1% more MF and the material cost is through the roof. All told if you got all exotic jewelry you would net another 5% MF. I will be sticking with my greens.

**MF Numbers**

MF from Armor = 3x6 = 18% MF

MF from Runes = 10+50 = 60% MF

MF from Weapon = 3+15(from sigil) = 18% MF (I use a greatsword and don't know if two of these would stack)

MF Jewelry = 6x5 = 30% MF

OmNomBerry Food = 30% MF + 40% Increased gold rewards. (the raspberry bar one at 24% is good too)

That totals out to 156% MF. 

[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/zsbvw/magic_find_and_you_a_brief_faq/) is a useful breakdown of what magic find can do for you. Credit to Nosalv

 Now there is one more Piece of gear I have left out. During your personal Storyline you will be given 2 Back slot pieces.

At level 33 you get your [first back slot item](http://i.imgur.com/faUls.jpg). This backslot can be socketed with very low level gems or a copper doubloon.

At level 80 you get your second back slot item (it is a level 80 item). This one can be socketed with anything. There is no other backslot given in between.

Now I have been told that IF your guild has purchased the Guild Armorer with influence

*I think Part 5 will be about the personal storyline and how quests interact with multiple people in the party. I can't guarantee that one will be completed by end of today though.*

**Why?** Two key reasons:-   
1. The main cities are meant to be the **central hubs of the game**. They are meant to allow players to travel swiftly to craft, whatever. To foster this sense of central hubbiness, **they shouldn't cost anything to teleport to**.   
2. **It is currently excessively easy (and free) to get to a main city anyway.** To save yourself about a silver (even at low levels), teleport to the waypoint within Lion's Arch that takes you to the gates and run through a gate to one of the main cities. **This takes under five minutes, but that's a stupidly wasted five minutes, as I'm sure anyone would agree.**

The waypoint cost of main cities is just silly

This could happen to you.

I spent $20.00 for 1600 gems in Guild Wars 2 Gem Store to buy one armor skin.


What happened was that I clicked to buy the item and I got absolutely no message and I still had 1600 gems. Nothing happened. I waited a little bit and nothing. This made me believe that the game did not process the transaction, after about 3 minutes, I saw 3 ingame mails with the same item. My gem balance went from 1600 gems to 100 gems.

&gt; Once gems are used, but not limited to, trading gems for gold, ***buying unwanted items (including multiple purchases due to lag)***, or refunding partial amounts of gems from their full quantity, For more information regarding gems and gem purchases, please take a look at the Guild Wars 2 User Agreement, sub-section d: http://us.ncsoft.com/en/legal/user-agreements/guild-wars-2-user-agreement.html

This is abusive. This means that when their servers are lagging

The interesting part is that I have no right to complain about this. According to their user agreement

&gt; YOU ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT NCSOFT HAS NO OBLIGATION TO REFUND ANY PAYMENTS, FOR ANY REASON WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INTERRUPTION OR UNAVAILABILITY OF SERVICE (SEE ALSO SECTION 10). YOU ACKNOWLEDGE, AND FURTHER AGREE, THAT NCSOFT MAY, IN ITS SOLE AND ABSOLUTE DISCRETION, TERMINATE UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 3(c) ANY ACCOUNT RELATED TO ANY ATTEMPT TO OBTAIN A REFUND OF ANY PAYMENTS, AND THAT NCSOFT MAY TAKE ANY OTHER ACTION IT DEEMS APPROPRIATE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES


&gt; (vii) You acknowledge that Gems are digital material with no cash value, that the quantity of Gems in Your Account may be increased or decreased by NCsoft in its sole and absolute discretion for any reason or no reason whatsoever, that You have no right to a refund related to Gems, that there is no right to transfer or exchange Gems, and that NCsoft may limit Your license to use Gems with respect to any Item, service, Content or time period related thereto. You further acknowledge that additional restrictions related to Gems, may be applicable if


&gt; 8. PROHIBITED AND IRREPARABLY HARMFUL ACTIVITIES CONCERNING NCSOFT

&gt; You acknowledge that You may not

&gt; (l) Institute any arbitration or other proceeding against NCsoft except as permitted under this agreement

So you completely lose all consumer rights as soon as you agree with their user agreement.

I figured I'd compile a quick list of tips that have personally helped ME out (not to mention they were tips that I didn't even know...) Without further ado:

* To set a ping on the map
*may be helpful while partying*

* Draw on the map is simple as well
*many people know this but I figured I'd throw it in for the uninformed*

* You can also put a personal marker on the map for your party members to see. To do this
*very useful if I was the party lead and needed to gather everyone in a central place*

* If you get bored with clicking the same button to fire off a skill or spell
*very helpful and something I didn't know about or somehow missed out on*

* To call a target
*Very helpful for party leaders

* Shift + left clicking an item will link them in the chat. You can also shift + left click a waypoint or skill to link them in chat. 
*I've still seen in chat where people didn't know how to link

* This one is definitely a timesaver for some of us: To take a quick screenshot WITHOUT the UI
*The most helpful of all tips

* Alt + Left click on an item
**Special thanks to aNERDon for pointing this time saver out**

* Holding down alt and/or control will display names of interactables on the screen. Useful for many heart quests! - 
**Special thanks to Sryzon &amp; many others for the tip**

* To split your stacked items and only select a few items from a stack just alt + left click and drag to an open slot in your bag. - 
**Special thanks to Garenzy for the tip**

* In the inventory screen if you click the cog wheel you can select deposit ALL collectibles. It's a huge time saver some people might have missed.

* When you are doing a heart quest or just farming mats from nodes
**Special thanks to Vonskrump for the awesome tips**

* Type /wiki &lt;search term&gt; in the chat and it will open your browser and redirect you to the official wiki article!
for example: /wiki Iron Ore /wiki Ascalon Catacombs - 
**Special thanks to Fzninuse for the tip**

* If you right click on a dye color in your panel
**Special thanks to Jatzninc &amp; LaughingPlague for the tip**

* In chat
/age - total time you have played on your character and total time. Although I'm not sure why but there seems to be missing time between total character time and total play time.
/ dance * - sync your dancing with other people for awesome Synchronized dance parties. - 
**Special thanks to Jiped for the tip**

* You can set your status (in the Y menu) to LFG. Players in the same zone as you can then add LFG players by going to the Y menu then selecting the tab on the side. - 
**Special thanks to iRanga0 for the tip**

1346230185.0,z0fff,PSA: Remember you can play your own music in GW2  should you desire to. [Tutorial],Anve94,1209,292,409,"Hey guys

Let me open up with a quote from Jim Boer (Arenanet Employee) about this.

&gt;No matter how fantastic a game’s music is, for instance.  Additionally, when appropriate, such as during cinematics, the game can revert back to in-game music temporarily to give the best possible cinematic experience, then resume the custom playlist when it’s done.
Did you know you can replace the (awesome) music in the game and substitute it with your own? -Jim Boer

This a feature in the game that in my opinion does not recieve enough recognition.

Here's how you do it:

&gt; Go to you documents folder -&gt; Guild Wars 2 -&gt; Music.

&gt;Create a playlist using your favorite media player.

&gt;The music files have to be in a format that FMOD supports by default: .mp3, .wav, .aiff, .mid, .it etc.

&gt; The playlist formats that are supported are: .wpl, .asx, and .wax

&gt; To play your playlists you have to give it a specific name. The playlist names that are currently recognized by the game are:

&gt; * Ambient
&gt; * Battle
&gt; * Underwater
&gt; * City
&gt; * MainMenu
&gt; * NightTime
&gt; * Crafting
&gt; * BossBattle

&gt; So if you have a playlist in the Guild Wars 2 Music folder called 'City'

Yet

**2 – Endgame**

I’ve played WoW on my more-than-free-time life and I was never into Raiding
I like the idea that the endgame of GW2 is just.. playing this beautiful world, because, well, it’s all really fun.

But the execution is poor.

**2a) Making farming more difficult is not getting rid of it**

ArenaNet several times took action that clearly intended farming to make farming more difficult, instead of X. People who only have X -1 time to give to farming and/or playing will be sub-par and will be irrelevant economically having trouble to enjoy several parts of the game.

This logic can be applied to Dungeons Tokens
It is a bit effective on stopping inflation because you ostricize a part of the playerbase from the economy. You deal with the sympthom not the disease.

**2b) The Downlevel System is not being well-used.**

You got people farming DE in Orr. Why? Because it is fast

And also

Orr is a tiny

I can’t believe ArenaNet came to conclusion that the best game drops for 80s would be concentrated on such a little area while GW2 is a huge and beautiful world.

Day before yesterday: I got my level 80 and went to explore Metrica Province with my lowbie friends (I want 100% completition and I enjoy playing the game all over)
We played for about 4 hours together

DEs

We were on mumble

I netted: 10 silver.

Yesterday I played 40 minutes in Orr. Waypointed there

I did about 5 DE

I netted: 1, but still…)
I am not fully exotic yet and I wanna be

I have not the will in me to farm in Orr for more than 2 hours on 2 days, really dull. 

Yet

**3 – Solutions?**

**3a) World drops normalized for 80s**

Why do I have to farm Orr if I want level 80 blue green and yellow drops? 

For a level 80 the Orr drop should be the whole world drop.

This would spread people arround

And I don’t mean “give a high chance to as-good-as-orr-drops in the world”. I mean the same

This would also spread the income to less farm-minded people

Use your own beautiful world ArenaNet. Make us use it efficiently.

**3b) Cosmetic Threadmill**

GW2 HAS a gear threadmill, and not with the best exotics, still, quite power-relevant) and it’s quite nice, it’s not too long, yet not so irrelevant, you have to work for it. 

I have no problem how it is.

But the tokens grind

Making people ignore the cosmetic run of the game or simply go all-in.
The idea would be to make some Cosmetic Threadmill

How about something between Exotic and Legendary?

Hor about Legendary Tiers?

Make it all cosmetic and nobody will complain it makes the game unfair

Think about it
Legendary it could make some fun market dynamic wouldn’t it?

I think ANet is already with this mindset tho

**TL;DR**

World Drop needs to mach Orr efficiency

Cosmetic Items are either easy or irrelevant. Need more steps in that threadmill.

Well

And I’m sorry but english is not my first language

Cheers.

I suggest crafting in Rata Sum as it's very central to the trade post.  The tabs are the order in which I did my crafting.  Not all crafts go to 400.  A couple stop at 350 and some at 375.  I only finish the 375-400 tier if it's cheap to do so.  I.e. the cost per craft is ~6-7s or less.  I.e. Jewelcrafting 375-400 IS NOT worth it at all.
This guide will tell you everything that you need to purchase from the trade broker in order to get to level 80.  Broken down per craft.  For every single craft I focused on upgrade components.  Sigils and Runes are the cheapest route for nearly all crafts.  Jewelcrafting obviously doesn't apply

http://www.gw2db.com to look up what mats for each upgrade component to make for each craft.  If I don't post a guide know that I use upgrade components other than for each tier.  Make sure you are either vendoring or selling items back on the TP when you are done.  You can recover up to 3g from some crafts.

Full time 1-80 is less than 8 hours.

Your participation would be appreciated.

**EDIT:** **Great response so far! Thanks everyone! I want to wait to share results so that people who are at work/school


*I want to do another survey after the next BWE.* Suggestions for new and/or improved questions? So far I have:

* Spell theif correctly. ;)
* Correct the wording on the ""did the BWE change your mind"" question to make it a stronger item. Did your opinion change from first to second BWE? Were you undecided previously but now solidified in your choice? Were/are you on the fence or 'almost' changed your mind?
* Add a question about location (North America, etc.)
* Add more diverse ranges for hours played on the higher end.
* Assuming the game will have updates/fixes
* Make sure there are 'No Opinion' and/or 'N/A' responses for appropriate items.
* What did you play in the BWEs? Did you play your main profession or did you avoid it? SOme players voiced that they avoided their intended mains completely. 
* Consider making the professions question with check boxes or make separate questions for mains and alts.
* Allow 'Other' and/or 'Neither' options for gender expression.
* Do you intend to play at release?
*  ""Which profession did you intend to be your main before the BWE"" and then a ""Which profession do think it will be now?"" - KingHavana


Any other suggestions?

Anyway, I'll put my plea out there:

Please

I'm not sure what you changed between BWE2 and BWE3. A change to AI, I wasn't taking as much damage, it just felt like the monsters were nerfed too much. My sentiments seemed to be echoed on the official forums too. People were making topics about the game being too easy.

I know arenanet said they want to ""ease"" people into the game, personally. Even if its a level 4-5 monster, the game should be challenging. I'm not expecting nail-biting, dark souls-esque hard here, but hard enough that it forces you to pay attention to dodge. People won't learn if you make it easy. They'll expect the same ease and then when they get their faces stomped into the dirt? They won't learn. They'll just whine and post on the forums about how hard the game is.

Remember the official forums when BWE1/2 were going on? There were clamors of posts about how the game was too difficult. This was by people who hadn't spent more then a few hours with the game and thus

Did anyone else have this experience with BWE3? Did anyone who got past the initial starter areas feel like the content was nerfed?

I hope they look to the balance/scaling again and make the starting areas harder. I know arenanet wants to make the increase gradual

EDIT: Well, I'll further clarify my point since people seem to misunderstand me as an ""elitist"".

What I want for the difficulty to be is a *gradual* curve. People have said the game feels easy from 1-20 and then ramps up suddenly. That's not good. That's bad for the new players ANet wants to attract and easy into the game. As I said before I added in this edit, it should still challenge you. What I'd like to see, personally, is this:

Level 2-3: Monsters are very basic. They attack you

Level 4-5: Monsters start using dodge often to force you to move. Ranged monsters should start to be introduced that force people to move and not simply sit there and hit buttons.

Level 6-7: Monsters should start hitting harder. They should start introducing boons/conditions

I want a curve like that. One that introduces new concepts and makes the player learn while they play, how to use their skills appropriately, etc. Leaving the first area easy is fine. I'm OK with that. Leaving it easy enough that it doesn't teach newer players anything about the mechanics of the game? I'm not.

I'm confident ANet can find a balance between challenging,False,self,t5_2r9po,1343255588.0,,HumanE,t3_x4gja

If you give all your alts cheap 8 slot bags you can easily double and triple you available inventory storage. I actually purchased 3 more character slots and this was one of my primary motivations. 

**2. Create a guild.**

 If you only play solo this probably isn't an option. BUT

 You need another person or two helping because alone you only get like 10 influence for completeing an event. But if you are together with a guildmate you will earn closer to 100. It increases exponentially.

 It took me and a buddy a couple weeks to get our bank. And we didn't even play together very often.

*NOTE: Around level 60 you are given a Tome of Influence. This gives whatever guild you are currently representing 400 influence. Then again

**3. Use the TP.**

 If you remember from Part 1, and then pull that item off with ANY of your other characters. 

 The TP is basically a giant account wide shared bank....for a fee. 

 The most common response I get to this is ""but what if someone buys you item"". Don't put your items on the TP at a competitive price. List the items for a few copper/silver higher than the lowest selling price. IF by some fluke your item does get sold

**4. Get bigger bags.**

 I still see people who have actually filled their bag slots with 4 slotters from the vendor. Don't be that guy. Check the trading post for cheap 8 slot leather bags or give someone the materials. When you get a bit more money you can purchase 15 slotters for a pretty reasonable 50 silver + leather. I would stick to leather bags as the other types of mats cost more.

Half the time I find it just quicker risking the chance of dying going to the end of a quest/POI/Waypoint than to actually fight the content itself. 

This tiresome spawn rate is more noticeable being 65+.

The worse respawn I have ever had was fighting a veteran DE that had two normal guards.

1347298855.0,znunh,All my knowledge - Part 3,koranuso,1075,269,63,"**UPDATED 9-11-12**

This post I will focus on PvE and Dungeon tips.

**1. Build types.**

 The most common build you see is the glass cannon. This applies to pretty much any class in the game. Most people like to start with Power at low levels

 This build is fine for fighting mobs out in the world and grinding hearts or dynamic events. It is even viable in most Story Mode dungeons (aside from maybe Ascalon Catacombs).

 The thing is

 If you want to try out Explorable Mode dungeons and get the rare gear skins form those

 I guarantee your dungeon and probably PvP experience will be better and you won't even notice a difference in PvE.

 As an experiment I started a Guardian alt. Gave him nothing but Vit/toughness gear and vit/toughness traitlines. He can still murder PvE content easily and can run dungeons like a boss. I was actually able to 3 man the first boss in Caducus Manor last night due to my characters insane health/toughness/regen. It allowed me to always stay up while my other two teammates died repeatedly. Fight did take like 10 minutes though but was still awesome. 

 My main Warr is using a full MF set but as soon as I have the mats I will be making a 4/6 set of Power/Vit/Tough and 2/6 set of Pow/Tough/Healing. My weapons will also have Pow/Tough/Healing. Warriors have a much higher hp/armor/toughness then guardians. And when speced properly can CC like a boss. I expect I will be stomping Explorable Mode dungeons on her soon.

*NOTE: The Pow/Vit/Tough gear can be acquired for karma from Melandrus Temple in Cursed shore. Also apparently from Vigil armor and WvW vendors. I had to go with 4/6 because


**2. Dungeons.**

 The first dungeon in GW2 is Ascalon Catacombs and it is hard. Really hard. So hard that it may actually turn you off of dungeons in general. It sure did for me. After beating AC a few times and dying a lot more I decided dungeons just weren't for me and proceeded to level all the way to 80 without stepping foot in another one. 

 I was wrong though. Dungeons are awesome...after Ascalon. The later dungeons are far more manageable in Story Mode. Even glass cannons can do fine in them. Plus you get to see a part of the story that just doesn't come up in the Personal Storyline.

 Now what are some things you can do to not die in dungeons?

**A.** Have gear your level. Sound simple right

**B.** Have a ranged option. I don't care what class you are. The majority of fights just are not safe for melee unless you have some very stout stats and gear. Stay at range and kite ALL THE THINGS. This goes for trash mob pulls as well as bosses. 

**C.** REVIVE your downed party members. You can safely ignore anyone that is dead

**D.** If you are DEAD (not downed) rez and run back. Don't expect people to revive you. It takes a loooong time to ressurect someone who has died.

*There is a lot more to say on this I am sure but that's a start. I think Part 4 will be on how to acquire your first few sets of level 80 gear to get started with Karma farming and dungeon running.*

But when you have a massive game like GW2 and every feature and bit of code can have a cross impact on every other feature, it is a lot more complicated than some folks are allowing for. Even Mojang, which has a fairly small team developing Minecraft, puts out releases much more slowly than Notch did when he was working by himself--but the quality is way, way higher.

This status information is also available on the [*Guild Wars 2* wiki](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Game_status_updates). Check there for the most recent information.

**Account security** - Protect your account! We've seen hackers systematically scan email addresses and passwords harvested from other games, but we need your help too. Make sure that you use a strong, unique password for *Guild Wars 2* that you've never used anywhere else. For best security, use a unique email address too, and see our [blog post](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/tips-for-keeping-your-guild-wars-2-account-secure/) for more tips.

**Email authentication** - We now have email authentication enabled for all players who have validated their email addresses. This feature sends an email whenever it detects a login attempt to your account from a location you haven't played from before

We've learned of an incompatibility between email authentication and older versions of Internet Explorer. We're working on a fix

If you're not receiving account verification emails or account authentication emails

**Parties, you may still see intermittent outages. These outages cause symptoms such as party members not appearing on the map, party members not staying in the same overflow servers as they travel between maps, and guild invites not working.

**Trading Post** - Yesterday we opened the Trading Post for a random, and are preparing a larger-scale test today.

**Tournament Rewards** - We believe we've addressed the problem with tournament chests not appearing. Let us know if you still see any issues with this.

**World v. World** - We're aware the world v. world matches have not been resetting properly. We're preparing an update to fix this. Once the issue is fixed

**Worlds** - We added three new worlds in Europe yesterday

**Overflow** - During this initial surge of high concurrency, but you're not on the same overflow servers, you can form a party together, then right-click on your friend's portrait in the party list and click ""join"".

We expect the use of overflow servers to naturally subside as players spread out more through the world.

**Botting** - We suspended accounts of 750 players running bots. We're ramping up and will soon apply permanent bans for cases of substantial botting.

**Exploits** - If you discover an exploit in the game

**Forums** - Our most important priority at the moment is to ensure that the game runs stably and flawlessly. So as to not create additional demand on our infrastructure and on our programming team

**Wiki** - We increased wiki server capacity to address issues users are seeing. We plan to start posting these updates to the wiki

**Next software updates** - We're making non-disruptive changes throughout the day. We'll publish the next back-end server update tonight at midnight Seattle time. The game may be unavailable for approximately 20-60 minutes while we perform this update.

Lions Arch has become the social hub of GW2 and this is fine
 Surely there is something that could be done
 
 A few idea's to increase the usage of these cities? 
- Racial skill: Travel to your home city (30 min cool down) 
- Level 80 dynamic events: Invasions
- Minor boosts (+crafting
- Mystic Forge's in each city.

 Does anyone have any ideas to help bring people back to these forgotten places? Or does nothing need changed?

Recommendations:

- Time limited events create a sense of urgency, with repeating events every 3 or 6 hours... you distribute your audience, and respect their personal lives.

- The game needs a mechanic to claim rewards if you've disconnected, and maybe make it tied to only special events, but people who did 2 hours of contributions and never got their chests? That's just wrong.

- The quality of the event was poor IMHO. It was a giant zerg for 2+ hours, and react and respond to threats at a strategic level.

- Expectation management. We need to know what's expected beforehand. For future events

Now over the last few days


Now finally, so when I heard the trading post was down, I was a little bit disheartened, but that didn't stop me. I just started doing small trades through mail. Nothing serious so that I didn't lose anything if the other player decided to scam. I started going bigger doing trades with around 40s and every time I sent first they delivered, and sometimes they managed to send to me straight away. I then started experimenting, I sent 30s to random people, messaged them that I accidentally sent it to them and If they could return it. Every single one did. I then sent it back to them telling them It was a test for and they passed so I decided to send them the silver to keep.


But down to statistics
I made 35 trades via the mail system.
Every single one of those trades went down well.

**Update 2:  I think the higher the Mystic Coin number in the recipe

I'm pretty sure a lot of people have figured out Mystic Forge recipes

**Quick primer on the Mystic Forge**

The Mystic Forge does 2 things:

* Random items when you combine 4 random items
* Set recipes that give you the same thing each time.  A lot of these are level 80 exotics weapons/armor.  I'm pretty sure each recipe with a scroll gives an 80 exotic.  We just have to figure out which recipes give what.

So I bought a lot of singletons of crafting materials so I could see what recipes the Mystic Forge has.  Here's what I found.  Here's a list of shorthand I use (Miyani is the NPC next to the Mystic forge)

* Wine = Elonian Wine - 25.6 silver from Miyani.
* Scroll = Eldritch Scroll - 50 skill points from Miyani
* Crystal - 5 for 3 skill points from Miyani
* C. Dust - Crystalline Dust
* Ecto - Glob of Ectoplasm - get it from salvaging level 80 rares with a master salvage kit
* When I refer to fine crafting materials like bones

Some people are having trouble, and the other two will be the components you want.

For example if you want a greatsword

1 scroll + 30 coins + 5 ori greatsword blade + 5 ori greatsword hilt

and you would get Mystic Claymore

1353499494.0,13k9mb,Skin Wardrobe and why adding it should be a high-priority,gibzy7,938,194,197,"This is not as simple as you think. Yes

The following is how I see it implemented (this is just my vision
__________

*Why it's needed:* Keeping armor/weapon skins in the bank is messy and very inconvenient. It's also impossible, GW2 has **an appearence-based progression**. As in skins. As in the end-game boils down to getting more skins. /nuff said
__________

*UI:* A new window, Heavy Armor, Weapons and Costumes. In each tab should be a list of all of the available skins in game, corresponding to that tab. They should be organizable alphabetically by name, by type (chest, hands, axes, etc.) and by set name (applicable only to armor and costumes tabs)

As a skin is added (unlocked) to your collection, so that their alt can use it.

The process of unlocking skins can be done in different ways. My proposition - use transmutation stones, depending on the rarity of the skin. And make the original item be destroyed as you add the skin, to prevent people buying items on TP to just get the skin and re-sell the item. Using the skin that you've already unlocked however should be **free and infinitely available for any character on your account**, as it's done with the HoM rewards. 
__________

*Good things this will do for A-NET bank account:* People will start buying transmutation stones
__________

*Good things this will do for players:* Provides **a new type of goal**, meaning a more visually pleasant and varied mass of players, instead of everybody wearing CoF armor.
__________

*Good things this will do for PvE:* Throw more people in **different** dungeons. Right now, since with the introduction of Fractals, the normal dungeons are turning into ghost-towns (not that Ascalon). 

Also, people are just banking it in hopes to get legendary weapons one day. Now they can use it to buy skins for karma

You can even go a step further, so that people can't buy them on auction house, and should have a small (but not frustratingly so) drop rate. This will throw a huge wave of players to **all** of the zones of the game, if each of the zones has a unique-looking set that drops only in that zone. No more complains of the world being deserted.

[Official forum thread link](https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/game/suggestions/Why-Skin-Wardrobe-should-be-a-high-priority/)
__________

**TL;DR**
Skin wardrobe is good. Convenient way of keeping and organizing unlocked skins. A new goal at endgame - collect all skins. More people will do unpopular dungeons, but make the skin permanently available and free to any character on account.

UPDATE 1: To many posts saying that this is a good idea, when your -insert class here- is completely broken in sPvP, or when you've just been PWN'D by an invisible mob in WWW - relax. It has been stated numerous times that ANet has different teams working on different parts of the game. Implementing this idea will not take away from them working on balance, bots, performance, etc.

UPDATE 2: Transmutation stones

Long before the events of Guild Wars 2, however, was not king by birthright. He garnered public support for his claim through triumphs in the guild wars, and with that, ousted the rightful king, Duke Barradin. 


Many citizens of old Ascalon were distrustful of Barradin, but not entirely. Rurik and Althea were to be wed soon, but as fate would have it, Ascalon saw the dawn of its final day. 


The Charr unleashed a powerful and ancient magic, and acting a precursor to their invasion, and ultimately their (pyrrhic) victory over the humans. Two years after the searing, Lady Althea was captured by Charr raiders. After a desperate search attempt from her father, Duke Barradin, Lady Althea is found to be dead. Immolated as sacrifice by the Flame Legion shaman, the ruling caste of the Charr war machine. 


With the stage set, the player is offered a quest to find materials suitable to create the perfect gift for the Prince's love, Lady Althea. You are tasked with finding three items: a beautiful pearl, a beautiful feather, and of course, a beautiful pendant. 

Could it be a mere coincidence that an item, with such a high cost, and such a strange lack of attributes exists? I should think not;
it must have a purpose. It is eligible to be placed in the mystic forge


So I challenge you, and nefarious individuals: Join me in solving the mystery of the beautiful pendant.

**Edit Part Deux:** 
I've made a new and terrible discovery. In Diessa Plateau, Lanar offered to sell me items: 100 steel mining picks, at the price of twenty silver.

This leads me to believe that perhaps there's a problem with the pricing table in this area

6/29/2013:  [Changes](http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/1cjmri/new_player_guide_to_leveling_a_mesmer_the/caufbye)

## Intro

There are only two known ways in the universe to level a mesmer without wanting to hang yourself by your toenails by level 10.  

They're squishy at low levels moreso than most classes, thieves or warriors) and hence harder to level, don't outgrow that till around 50-60, and don't actually get good till you're geared up in Exotics at 80.  

But at 80 they're truly magical, sPvP, WvW), and well worth it if you can stick it out.  This is how to stick it out.

**First**, which defeats the point of a *leveling* build.  What you want is a leveling build that is effective with Adept and Master traits only.

**Second**, [[3]](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6s-m1Hs_M0), [[4]](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H70RjrLdeLs).  Also, familiarize yourself with [GW2's general combat mechanics](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_zMPcT2jgc) if you're not already.

**Third**

The first, conditions, and damage when clones are killed or overwritten and from Staff skills.  It is strong for solo'ing lots of trash mobs, handling accidental overpulls (especially useful in caves and enclosed areas with fast-spawning mobs and nowhere to run if you accidentally pull too many at once).  It is also very good at solo'ing Champion mobs (if you have the patience for epic 20-30m battles of attrition).

The second, [[2]](http://dulfy.net/2013/02/25/gw2-arenanet-looking-into-condition-caps/) on DE boss fights.

* 60:  Alternate:  [The Clone Spammer](https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/professions/mesmer/condition-build-The-Clone-Spammer)

\* Forgot to include this in the build links

**Playstyle**:  Keep as many clones up as possible, and [kite them](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Aggro#Tanking) while Staff #1 autoattack + conditions kill them.

Stack conditions and boons with bouncing Staff #1 autoattack

Don't Shatter - Shatter does *not* apply Cripple or the random condition.  Only shatter if you're about to die and need Distortion (F4) or Diversion (F3) to escape.

**Primary Weapon**:  Staff.  Most importantly, increasing the damage of everything else you're doing.  Damage starts low, but ramps up quickly as boons stack on you (see that in action [at this point in Mr. Prometheus's guide video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-B3mkM7dqM&amp;t=18m35s)).  

Counterintuitively, so the faster the boons and conditions build on you and the target.  Between Staff #1, #4 Chaos Armor, and #5 Chaos Storm the range of defensive boons and conditions that go up make you nearly invincible - Aegis, Blind, Protection, Weakness, Confusion, Chilled

**Secondary Weapon**:  Secondary and any healing/utility/elite skills I didn't specify are up to you.  I usually went with Greatsword (GS) b/c its Phantasm does Cripple + more AoE damage, Focus (runspeed), Pistol (strong ranged dps phantasm) are all interesting as well.  Torch gives you an instant stealth to get out of trouble, but its phantasm is the weakest of all phantasms mesmers have.

You can singlehandedly take out groups of mobs

**Gear**:  Power or a mix of Power and Condition Damage.  Toughness for survival since mobs tend to do more direct damage than condition damage (ignores toughness).

**Weaknesses**:  The one thing this build is weak at, or the boss will quickly reach the  condition stack cap [[1]](http://www.guildwars2hub.com/features/editorials/guild-wars-2s-bleed-cap), [[2]](http://dulfy.net/2013/02/25/gw2-arenanet-looking-into-condition-caps/).

When someone applies a 26th stack of that condition

So just keep in mind if you want to [level via big DE's](http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/13vk5h/dynamic_event_chain_list/) with zergs, similar to the next one below.  However, given that most players are now 80 and the lower pre-80 leveling zones are sparsely populated, a strong solo build is optimal. 

-----------

## **Illusion Army**

This leveling build is more direct-damage oriented and is based on taking all traits (and signet) that buff illusions' health and damage and letting them fight for you.

In a nutshell, or 3) buff illusion damage.  

Cooldown reduction and survivability traits take precedence over damage, this is just one suggestion:

\* At low levels it's generally better to focus on reducing illusion spawning cooldowns than increasing illusion damage

** 3% more damage per illusion applies to both player damage and illusion damage.

*** Again

**** If your illusions are dying faster than your weapon cooldowns can produce them, like [condition removal and teleport](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?fgAQNAscxEx0jq5QTicqQ0hSB25dkUoapWJF82FC).

**Playstyle**:  The name of the game is to reduce cd on Illusion spawning from Greatsword (GS) or Staff and Sword/Sword (S/S) weapon sets as much as possible, particuarly the Phantasms, as much as possible.  

**Weapons**:  Initiate fights at range with GS or Staff, swap to S/S for melee range, burn it down with Blurred Frenzy (Sword #2), avoid damage with Illusionary Ripost (Sword #4).  

Keep as many phantasms and clones up as possible

Alternately, also cast Sword's Clone (#3), which cripples the target and holds it in place till iWarden finishes casting.  

Then use the #3 secondary cast to swap places with the clone and Blurred Frenzy while the Phantasmal Warden does Blurred Frenzy at the same time.  Can do a lot of damage to single or packs of mobs with that combo.

This build is more offensive, but is better at Dynamic Event farming and dungeon leveling.  

**Gear**:  Again

So here is what you can do post 80:

* I think the most important one should be: Take your time

* Go get the rest of those pesky skill points and complete your skill tree. 

* If you haven't (and you should have

* Build your character. What does this mean? Restat for your playstyle. Really discover how you play (See above), so restatting = final build (you can of course restat later). You want DPS? Go put all your points so your character does insane damage. Want to be tank / support? Healing / Health it is!! It's your choice, your character. Build him as such. (You'll want this to be useful in FotM and Dungeons!)

* Figured out your particular playstyle and how you want your build? Good. You'll probably change it later

* Ok, whatever you want, really. There are fractals of the mist which are 8 mini dungeons in which you and your party will go through 3 of them to gain loot!

* Dungeons! Most of the dungeons come between 75-80, gold grinding, token grinding, etc. 

* Working on a legendary weapon is great fun, and they are not easy to obtain.  [Guide](http://www.guildwars2guru.com/topic/64363-legendary-weapons-guide/), [Videos](http://www.guildwars2guru.com/topic/64363-legendary-weapons-guide/)  (Thanks to Astema!)

* 100% map completion? I *know* you haven't done that yet. Get on it!!! 

* Crafting? That's that thing that I bought those harvesting things to harvest all these different things for are isn't it? YEP! You spent hours hours and more hours picking berries and cutting down trees and mining for dailys. Now put it to use!! Get all your crafts up. You can only have 2 at a time

* ... I hear rumors of some story for this game... Hmm. Just a rumor but there may be this little green marker that leads to a quest someplace in Tyria. Follow that until they go away. Pesky buggers. (The story is really well done!! If you haven't gotten far

* Use your karma! But only use it [here](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Temple_armor) as they give you the best stuff. Actually? Who am I to tell you what to do? Buy whatever you want!! Just a suggestion though.

* PvP or WvW. They're a lot of fun and offer a lot past 80. It's basically a whole different world. (I don't have a lot of experience with these

      * Here's some input about WvW.
There are a lot of things you can do! Yes
You can help defend key points, this happens and it's really cool that no one attacks each other if it's not their turn. These people are also super friendly!). There are 2 different maps (As all the BL are the same) so you can spend time manning different siege weapons and learning different strategies.
Off WvW
But my most favorite thing that I don't think is emphasized enough: meet new people! This game is teeming with many great people

* There are Daily / Monthly / a ton of other achievements you can earn. I bet you don't have 1/4 of them yet. Why are you still reading this? GOGOGOGO

* Some of my favorite things to do: jumping puzzles and mini-dungeons. Some of can get pretty challenging too like the Flame Temple in Diessa Plateau. They're also great for a break from leveling. Another thing I would suggest is to just ask guildmates if they need any help

* If you've done everything you enjoyed

* Do what you enjoy! It really all boils down to having fun. Want to gear out your character? Do it! Love the dungeons and FotM? Gather groups and do those. PvP more your thing? Gear up and get'em. WvW your style? That other realm isn't going to debunk itself from the castle. Get to stepping soldier!

* I would also recommend trying different professions: Elementalist

* If you haven't found a guild yet

* Roleplaying: Well, in a sense, ""become the character"" they are playing and interacting with the fictitious world they reside in. Put simply, because I understand that this may sound strange to people who aren't into this sort of thing, the player eats, drinks, socializes, goes to taverns, pretending as if they actually happened.
There is so much to the aspect of roleplaying, all the while playing a bit of make-believe. Roleplaying content is so abundant due to the fact that it is player-driven and is always different and changing.
I hope this helps to at least give a minimal understanding of roleplaying.

1349201486.0,10ttf8,Protect yourself from getting kicked in a Dungeon Run.,valdi313,964,245,319,"I've said this before on other posts

A few things that you should do to protect yourself.

1. Hit PrintScreen before the run starts. This will give you a screen shot of the group with all of the names. **Make sure to enable ""Simple Party UI"" in the options so the names will show on the UI. (credit to NeckNeckNeck).**

2. Tell the group you took a screen shot to protect you from this practice. If they kick you

3. If they do kick you before the final boss

This should stop the practice
Spread the word. Lets try and keep this community honest. Weed out of the bad apples.

** Edit 1: To everyone saying that it is not very polite to announce that I am ready to report people before the run starts, I wouldn't say anything else. **

Edit 2: For those players saying a SS is not needed for a ticket. You are correct. I say to take a SS with the player names because when you are removed from a group

Edit 3: For our more dense readers....THIS IS MEANT TO STOP THE GRIEFING OF PEOPLE IN DUNGEON RUNS. This is not meant for a way to get carried through a dungeon. This is not meant as a tool for a kid to hang over the group's head so they can't kick him because he sucks. Gezz.....

1373288422.0,1hv0ap,Bazaar of the Four Winds Overview/guide,dulfy,824,150,444,"Hey everyone

Below is a pointed form version

Bazaar of the Four Winds is a MASSIVE patch. I don't know if this is the largest patch ever yet but it is just crammed with content and I think almost everyone will find something that they like. There is a brand new ZONE, new backpiece skins, two new minigames, a new sPvP map, account achievement rewards, massive scavenger hunt (not for precursors), new crafting mat, and a ton of new achievements to get.  

**1) Account achievement rewards**

* Every 500 achievement points

* Milestones that end in three 0s will give you Zenith weapon skins and those Milestones in high tiers will give you 3 piece armor skins (helm

* For each milestone you chose which skin to unlock. Once unlocked

* All of the armor/weapon skins are animated

* Here are some pictures if you can't view the links below: http://imgur.com/a/47xAD

* Radiant/Hellfire armor gallery (w/videos of animation): http://dulfy.net/2013/07/08/gw2-radiant-and-hellfire-armor-skin-gallery

* Zenith weapon gallery (w/videos of animation) http://dulfy.net/2013/07/08/gw2-zenith-weapon-gallery

**2) Bazaar of the Four Winds**

* New zone east of Mount of Maelstrom called Labyrinthine Cliffs. Only here for 4 weeks. Heavy Canthan/Oriental influence

* You get special movement abilities here that allow you to jump higher

* Half of the zone is the Bazaar with various merchants. Other half is a massive airship called Zephyr Sanctum. 

* Massive scavenger hunt here to hunt down 40 sky crystals in hard to reach places with your special skills. Zone has alot of vertical layers so maps are useless and you either have to find them yourself or use a video guide. 

* New diving location high above the sky. Long drop

* Funny Quaggan has an hourly firework show where he makes alot of jokes. 

* Some pictures of the zone: http://imgur.com/a/iAcB5

* Scavenger hunt guide for use tomorrow: http://dulfy.net/2013/07/08/gw2-sky-crystals-lessons-from-the-sky-achievement-guide

**3) Sanctum Sprint**

* New racing minigame similar to GW1 Rollerbeetle Racing or Nintendo's Mario Cart. You run on a track with many obstacles that you must overcome and gain power-ups to slow down your opponents. 

* Earn achievements for placing on top and a title for placing first. 
* Video will demonstrate this better: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj_pCrvPDh4
* Guide to Sanctum Sprint for use tomorrow: http://dulfy.net/2013/07/08/gw2-sanctum-sprint-activity-guide

**4) Belcher's Bluff**

* Drinking minigame modeled after one of Order of Whisper's missions. Each sip you take dmg your HP but you can bluff or belch your opponents

* Permanent addition to the game

* If you defeat all 5 masters

* Guide to Belcher's Bluff: http://dulfy.net/2013/07/08/gw2-belchers-bluff-activity-guide/

**5) Skyhammer PvP Map**

* 3-point capture map with a focus on verticality with some added twists

* Massive cannon that can be controlled by players. Has a powerful attack that does 10k+ damage plus

* Has glass floors that shatter 2-3 seconds after coming into contact with a player. This allow you to create gaping holes in the ground to stuff your opponents in. 

* 2/3 of the objectives are near edge of the map with glass floors. Knockback become super useful here and if you play smart you can win against larger numbers 

* Video demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fB3ZzqAODs

* Overview of Skyhammer map: http://dulfy.net/2013/07/08/gw2-skyhammer-pvp-map-preview

**6) New backpiece and helm skins**

* Limited time backpiece and helm skins purchased with Fortune Scraps. Fortune Scraps are earned from kite fortunes which are looted from kite baskets in the open world or from gemstore.

* Both backpiece and helm are animated and look really cool.

* Pictures: http://imgur.com/a/RgutX

* Guide to these fortune scraps &amp; skins (w/videos of animations): http://dulfy.net/2013/07/08/gw2-fortune-scraps-and-zephyrite-skins-guide

**7) Quartz and Celestial recipes**

* Quartz new resource that can be mined with any mining pick. Each node can be only mined once per account per day.
* Quartz also obtained from kite baskets in open world zones
* To make Quartz do anything you need to turn it into a Charged Quartz. It takes 25 Quartz to do that and you need to do it at a place of power (i.e. skill point that allow you to commune with it). 
* You can only make 1 charged quartz crystal per day and they are account bound.
* New recipes require 5 Charged Quartz per exotic insignia/inscription so prepare to wait 5 days to craft one piece.
* New celestial recipes can be obtained from Zephyr Sanctum Supply Boxes. Each box has a 100% chance to give you a new recipe and give you some quartz as well. 

* Zephyr Sanctum boxes can be brought with various raw crafting mats or event items like Candy Corn from Halloween or Zhaitaffy from Dragon Bash

* Celestial recipe allow you to craft gear with bonus to all stats
* Detailed guide on Quartz/new recipes: http://dulfy.net/2013/07/08/gw2-quartz-crystals-and-celestial-recipes-guide/

**8) Achievement UI revamp &amp; new achievements**

* New UI interface for achievements

* Summary page where you can get your rewards

* Watch List page where you can easily add/remove achievements for tracking

* Lots of new achievements with the Bazaar of the Four Winds event. Some are related to the scavenger hunt, dungeons, fractals not unlike the caches in Sky Pirates. 

* More detail writeup on achievement UI change (w/video): http://dulfy.net/2013/07/08/gw2-account-achievements-rewards-and-ui-revamp-overview

As always, so I waited until I had what I thought was a cute idea before going ahead and painting it. 

I have the most fun painting cute things, Sylvari, and Asura, I wanted to try something else. After seeing that baby Quaggan video, I decided I wanted to paint something using them. I worked on this on during my lunch yesterday and today, and spent some more time on it tonight. Probably 3-4 hours. 

One more thing

So here's a really cool experience that I have been wanting to share

Just under a month ago. I was aware that my paintings have been around the Arenanet offices. E-mails

And that totally happened! We went around, smiles and all ""I painted it"". They were all really great, many high-fives were had. I managed to take two pictures; one with Chris (I think), who recognized the shirt right away since it was his wallpaper, and Evan, who I had seen before on an Arenanet tour video. I'm told the red golem + yellow balloon lives on a bulletin board where they post up all their employee birthdays, which is awesome.

-------------------------------------------

GW2 is loads of fun and I enjoy playing it, no epic journeys, etc. I mean there's a personal story, but it gets a bit bland after level 30 for me. Other than the personal story, the Hearts provide little to no lore or substance. I guess there's a bit of lore spread around the game, but it isn't as rich as lore in other games like Skyrim or even *that other game*.

I mean I'm to the point now where I don't even really feel like logging in sometimes, but I usually find myself spending that free time playing something else. Normally, I get wrapped up into RPGs and I don't want to put them down. But with GW2, it's just like there's nothing that really pulls me in when it comes to PvE.  I'm not saying that GW2 isn't fun, I just can't seem to get into that mode where it's like time is passing by quickly, you don't pay attention to your surroundings.. you just play and get lost in the game.

What do you guys think? Anyone else feel like something is missing from GW2 that is in most RPGs? I feel like I know what it is,,False,self,t5_2r9po,1349022741.0,,True

 Anything that inspires you to see the beauty through the 'meh' isn't something to be taken for granted.

Colin Johanson on Guild Wars 2 in the Months Ahead

Happy 2013 everyone! I wanted to take the time to provide insight on some of the exciting features

It’s been a fantastic ride so far – in the few months since Guild Wars 2 launched we’ve sold more than three million games and have become the most critically acclaimed MMO of 2012. We’ve introduced the new Fractals of the Mists dungeon experience, our Lost Shores world event, and two massive holiday events.

And this is just the beginning. Our goals for the New Year are to build on the areas of the game that were successful in 2012

So what does all of that mean? Let’s dive in:

 

**What Makes GW2 Unique and Successful?**

 

Community and player relationships are key components to what makes Guild Wars 2 tick

Allowing players to share experiences in an open world where other players are seen as helpful, to support other each other, and when the flow of the game ushers players to go places where they run into other players across all levels and have shared experiences. Our shared loot system, dynamic level adjustment system, shared resource nodes, multi-player skill combos, and the ability for every player to revive one another are all examples of key game features that help support this concept of a community-driven experience.

 

Guild Wars 2 is a game that’s about these shared experiences. Through the dynamic event system, or you’re in the midst of an event and it dynamically scales with more players arriving becoming more epic, or you’re fighting for control of Stonemist Castle in WvW, where each fight can play out differently.

Since launch, and the Lost Shores invasion are all examples of this style of event run since the launch of GW2.

These key pillars — a sense of community and a dynamic

 

**GW2: The Living World Game**

In order to continue to build on the pillars of Guild Wars 2

We will accomplish this is by building a world that has truly unique storylines and event experiences that play out over extended periods of time

We attempted to do this with varying degrees of success with our Halloween, we’ve learned an incredible amount about how to ensure big events like this are successful moving forward.

Our Wintersday event was an example of applying a lot of the lessons learned from the earlier events to ensure we create content that is inclusive, we discovered still more areas we can improve for future world events to make them even more exciting.

To complement this concept of regular world events with strong stories and themes, which in turn adds to the sense of an ever-evolving open world.

This means we need to give reasons for players at all levels to explore these areas, we need to make sure our existing world is as strong as possible, and gives reasons for people at all levels to go back and play and explore in the entire game we have built.

So how are we going to do that?

 

**Systems and Rewards Supporting the Living World**

To make playing in our open world worthwhile

One of our focuses is expanding and leveraging our achievement system. The concept behind this is to allow players to earn new rewards for achievements, which will help drive players to different areas of the world and play together.  Later, we’ll also be adding a system that lets you complete a subgroup of achievements to fulfill your daily. For example, if there are 6 daily achievements available, you’ll only need to do 4 of the 6.  So you can choose the achievements that you’re most interested in.

We’ll continue to offer cosmetic rewards such as titles, etc.  which will remain prizes earned for completing specific parts of the game.  These will show off the prestige of your character, but will not make your character more powerful than other characters.

As we look at developing new types of rewards further into 2013, but we don’t want to force our players on endless gear treadmills for new tiers of gear we add every 6 months. You won’t see another tier between ascended and legendary in 2013 for example. Our goal will be to use our existing reward systems and build new ones that are fun and exciting that step away from the stale gear grind reward systems you see elsewhere. Later in 2013, we’ll begin to introduce more of these systems once we’ve finished rolling out the remaining ascended gear and infusions.

 

**What About Guilds? I Want To Do Things with My Friends.**

Guilds are an extremely important to the game.  We need to ensure there is a volume of content to foster this strong community/social bond. To that end, and tools to allow guilds, of all sizes, to play a stronger part in solidifying the communities of the GW2 world.

 

**OK

Many of the features

Polishing the existing WvW experience to ensure it shines in every way possible is a major goal for us which requires addressing major areas we know need a lot of attention. We’ve been working on two of these projects for a while now

Firstly, and guestingability, which allows players to visit friends on other servers in every part of the game except for WvW. To encourage players to stick with a single server for WvW and fight for the pride of that server, server changes will incur a fee and have time limitations.  Second, we’ll make improvements to culling. We recently ran small tests on Live to help us move towards eliminating as much culling from WvW as possible. The results have been promising, and we have a number of additional culling features in development. If all goes well, our hope is 2013 is the year culling ceases to exist

We’re adding new features as well. We’ll introduce a system of prestige and advancement specifically designed for WvW. This will give players a progression path where they earn new WvW-only abilities and bonuses

**Hey

Much like the other aspects of the game

For those more interested in progression in PvP

For those more interested in competitive PvP, and visible places for everyone to see rankings of the best teams/players in the world. We also want to make it easier to play games against good opponents, and give the ability to compete in games where ranking matters quickly and easily. Of course, this also means down the road we’ll have major tournaments, prizes, and more to help drive the growth of this competitive PvP community along-side our less hardcore PvP players.

 

**Holy Moly This Got Long – Anything Else?**

We’re also focusing on improving a number of other areas; far too many to cover in detail. Examples of some of the major areas we’re working on in the first half of 2013 include:

·         Leaderboards on our website where you can compare your abilities with other players to find out who is the best in the world.

·         Expanded and re-designed encounters for bosses in dungeons and the open world.

·         New types of achievements which tie into the new systems of achievement rewards.

·         Continuing to improve the security of the game fighting botters and hackers

·         Identifying existing parts of the game that can be improved and made more fun/exciting

·         Improving the new player experience, and more quickly learn the game without being overwhelmed.

·         Improving the “looking for group” tool to make it easier to find other players to play with in the game.

·         The improvements and fixes to the fractal dungeons

Just because it’s not listed here doesn’t mean it’s not being worked on

 

**In Closing…**

2012 was an amazing year for Guild Wars 2, the fun we have had both playing with and listening to our community, and all the great awards the game has received over the last few months. But we know this game can be so much more than what we’ve shown so far. We feel like we’ve only begun to scratch the surface of where the world of Tyria can go and what you can expect from an MMORPG. 2013 will be the year we truly launch into that journey, and just as we tried to change the paradigm and expectations of an MMO when we released Guild Wars 2, we now want to raise the bar for what players expect from a live game as well.

As we push the boundaries and do new things with what an online game can be, grow from them, and be as transparent about them as possible. We’ll also have some amazing moments, and hopefully craft gaming memories you and we will never forget. And though you may not always know it, we’ll be right there in-game playing next to you as well.

Due to downleveling, repairs will cost more silver on top of waypoint cost.
most low level events give small amounts of copper, as are people training mobs past you, since everything has very aggressive proximity agro.

Rewards dont scale, when the combat is nearly as challenging, and the penalties for mistakes so much greater?

I guess my point is did we all just drink the koolaid on how great a system downleveling is? It is certainly an elegant solution for solving 80s camping starting zones

Edit: since this gained traction

Im not complaining about money sinks

Im aware up to level 76 gear drops in low level zones. That system is cool until you reach level cap

My main point, doing something, and being rewarded appropriately for my level. Not recieving 76+ gear from mobs lower level than that defeats that idea.

It's no secret that when it comes to armor, likely with Asura coming in last. Pulling in far behind them are Charr. As far as my knowledge goes, issues with the armor of other races exist, but are comparably few. With Charr armor, stretching, clipping, poor texturing, you have no idea how deep the rabbit hole goes. It's been this way since launch and it's not looking to get any better. If anything

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* **Anatomy and Culture:**

Reason number one is that Charr culture and anatomy sit in a context far removed from the other races. We are a race that stand hunched, plus all the other various beastly features such as a muzzle, claws, and the like. Additionally, the Charr are a culture much unlike the other races. The Charr revere technology, not magic, and anything that alludes to magic is almost considered insulting within Charr society. Soldiers are the norm; and if you're not a soldier you wear simple rags and outfits because you are of lesser use to the Legions. None of this, is considered in Charr armor. The great irony, the Charr receive nothing in the form of armor or town clothes except those which are first modeled for humans both in anatomy and context, hoodies (for a race with horns). These are all human fashions

Almost every armor model in the game is designed with humans and humanoids in mind first. In fact, I believe, two outfits designed with Charr in mind: Vigil, and the Cook's Outfit. If you're asking about Citadel of Flame, we'll get back to that. There's a reason why I pick these two as examples: they generally conform to Charr anatomy. The Cook's Outfit features a muzzle cage which shows that it was designed specifically with muzzles in mind. Similarly, Vigil armor features large turtlenecks and shoulderguards indicative of the Charr. Heavy Vigil also features what I presume to be a rear flap for the tail, one that was never actually modeled properly and left to clip (you can see it [here](http://i.imgur.com/fl0EXGx.jpg)).

The only other reason I presume Vigil was designed with Charr in mind is because the founder was a Charr, particularly about the belt on the hip, and on the backs of the calves), and all three armor tiers have tail clipping. 

Back to the issue at hand; there's a concept illustration I like to use that shows how Charr armor *should* look. You can find that [here](http://i.imgur.com/1FvEUtn.jpg). Notice several things about how the armor *considers anatomy* in its design. Full face masks protect the entire head, protecting it. Space for horns is considered. These are the kinds of things that are essential to good looking, believable armor that are lost when you take the armor of a humanoid race and stretch it to fit a beastly race. Other examples of good Charr armor in concept are abound. Here's a [small gallery](http://imgur.com/a/N4yEr) with a few more images as examples. Googling 'Charr Concept Art' will yield you even more results. All are prime examples on conforming to anatomy and culture, and considers a race where even magical spellcasters wear minimalist robes or light plate armor instead of cloth gowns, and where soldiers take consideration of their form in crafting armor. What hurts me most is to know that Anet is certainly not unaware of these things. [Their artists certainly are](http://i.imgur.com/vzmGF30.jpg), yet maybe bits and pieces of two or three of those designs at most made it into the game. 

Now, and that Charr do not exist in a vacuum. Does this necessarily excuse creating all armor for humans first and them exporting it to other races? No, but it's at least more understandable. It would take a lot of resources to design armor which would only fit the anatomy and culture of one race specifically, and thus Anet chooses to take the path that will appeal to the greatest number of people. That's good. However, here's the thing. The issues don't stop there. What's been argued above is not something that can be easily fixed, at least not without relocating a lot of time and resources. The second issue, however

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* **Undue lack of care and general apathy or indifference:**

I'm going to go out on a limb and say that, but with perhaps a few more examples you'll begin to see why. The fact of the matter is, even foregoing the above, Anet still puts in a shameful amount of effort when it comes to dealing with what armor they *do* give the Charr.  

Have you ever noticed how many Charr Warrior and Guardians wear full tier 3 cultural, is that not only does it look really *good*, everything else looks really *bad*. There's a reason why. Rytlock wears tier 3. Almost everything positive you can say about tier 3 heavy cultural can be chalked up to the fact that Rytlock had to have something to wear, and needed to look good doing it. The other Charr cultural armors? Some present tail clipping, and other issues that could have easily been avoided. In fact, it seems the only time Anet specifically cares about making sure Charr armor has a high level of quality to it is when it's being crafted for an important figure. Why do you think I mentioned Almorra Soulkeeper and Vigil armor? 

If the armors are not being purposed for a significant character, and come with all the features thereof. Stretching. Clipping. Removal of horns. It's almost impossible to find any armor or any combination of Charr armors without these things. And that's where the laziness comes in. Anet has shown no signs of improving these things, and continues to release stretched models, clipping, and other designs that clearly show undue lack of care for the Charr. Remember how I excluded Citadel of Flame armor from the list of armors designed for Charr? That's because it wasn't. Ironically, it's one the Charr's worst armor sets. Consider the first argument, and you realize that no Charr would ever be caught dead wearing anything relating them to the Flame Legion. Consider the second, *for* a Legion of Charr

So

[Here's what my Charr looks like without the helmet on.](http://i.imgur.com/BYyey7N.jpg)

[And here's what he looks like with it on.](http://i.imgur.com/grFY2N5.jpg)

Absent: Horns, dignity.

On a general level, this isn't about that. This is such an extreme level of laziness and lack of care that I can't even be mad, I'm simply *impressed*. This is a helmet that I'm guessing a very small proportion of the population has even dedicated enough time into the game to receive yet. It's supposed to be prestigious. On Charr, it's anything but. I have absolutely no doubt that whoever was tasked with modelling this helm simply took the helm for the humans, and placed it right on the Charr's head without even a thought that, culture and anatomy argument aside, it might be both ugly and uncaring to not even make an attempt to preserve the ears and horns of the character. Of course

So the helm looks awful, and that's the plan. But here's the problem: this sets a whole new precedent for laziness when it comes to modelling armor and putting even a trace amount of care into crafting a quality product. That's what this is all about. As I said, it's no secret that Charr get the short end of the armor stick, but this takes it to such a high degree that I can't help but worry for the future of Charr armor. This isn't an isolated incident being extrapolated by a slippery slope argument - it's a continuing decline in quality that is the basis for why I and many other Charr players feel that Anet simply *does not care*. 

And that's why I made this post. I have my completed Armor set for my guardian, and someone had to say something. In the grand scheme of things, is it a big deal? Not really. There's a whole game with lots of other issues to worry about. However, this is an issue that's very close to a race and a community that I very much enjoy, and to see things like this completely frustrates me. It's my hope that there's at least one person at Anet who it frustrates as well, who might be able to have a say. Not for the helmet, but for the future of Charr armor, and the quality of armor for races to come. The Charr community already has no hope for good looking armor unless we get new cultural sets, what have you. For their benefit as well

Bunny punishment comes into scene.

* A bunny appears in the player's hands
* It blocks him from sending in-game mail, too.
* To drop the bunny
* The combination will be displayed over the abilities
* I'm pretty sure a bot wouldn't be able to drop the bunny
* Result: Bots become slow dumbasses carrying bunnies around
* If after a while (30min?) he's still carrying the bunny
(another option is sending him to a new zone
* This way, and they don't plague WvW.

PS: The bunny should have red eyes and white fur.

Edit: I would like to highlight this reply:

&gt;The point is to annoy people behind the bots, but ArenaNet needs to gather information first.

&gt;This would stop, and each time they solve it, if they are reported again, it would take less time to make the bunny reappear, to the point it should be annoying as hell after, let's say, 4 times of being bunny'ed, and stacking.

1351184094.0,122nin,Suggestion: How to Improve the Game for People Who Like Collecting Things (Like Skins),SvennEthir,744,142,119,"**The Problem:** 
I am the type of player who really enjoys collecting things in games, it eats up a TON of bank space, and you lose a skin every single time you transmute an item. Simply adding new PvE collection tabs for the various weapons/armor like in PvP could work, but I have a better idea.

**The Solution:**
Skin Extractor Kits and a Skin Vendor. 
The Skin Extractor Kits would be purchased with gems
EDIT: Alternately

The Skin Vendor (who could be located in your home instance, have no value, and be unable to be forged) and use a transmutation stone to apply the skin to any item you wanted.

**Why This Works:**
Collectors are able to then have a good way to collect skins without too much hassle. They are automatically stored once extracted so no need to fill up the entire bank. You don't lose a skin every time you want to use another one

This also increases the amount of money to ArenaNet in two ways as well. People will be more likely to use transmutation stones (which are still required for the items from the Skin Vendor) to change their appearance knowing they are not losing any skins. In addition the collectors who want this convenience will pay for the Extractor Kits as well.

**Example:**
I purchase the full Citadel of Flame armor set. I purchase a Skin Extractor from the Gem Store. I use the Skin Extractor on each piece of the Citadel of Flame armor set. I then purchase the full Arah armor set and use a Skin Extractor on each piece. 

Now I go to my home instance and find the Skin Vendor. He now has a full set of Citadel of Flame and a full set of Arah items with no stats. I can ""purchase"" (for free) these items. I buy the Arah head piece. I then use a transmutation stone to transmute the skin from the no-stats skin item onto my current exotic head piece. Later on I decide I want to change my looks so I go back to this vendor and ""purchase"" the Citadel of Flame head piece. I then use a transmutation stone to transmute that onto the same headpiece as before, more money for ANet here, more convenience for me).

What do you guys think?

EDIT: If you like this idea then please post on the official forums suggestion thread I made so we can hopefully get some attention from ArenaNet:

----

For small or medium guilds, though, that I feel *needs* to be addressed right now. From what I understand, guild management is a low priority for them right now and that needs to change immediately. The mediocre at best guild management was tolerable at launch, it was a new game and I understood that I wasn't going to get much in the way of management features. I was ok with that. The game is now almost a year old and this is still a low priority to them and that's unacceptable.

----

The guild management features are bad enough for large guilds of people that are ok with using third party site

* **Guild information**

There is no reason not to include a ""Guild Information"" tab. I should not have to take up the amount of space needed to include the guild's Teamspeak server IP, and reddit address. There should be a tab where I can enter in all of that info, as well as the guild rules and possibly a bit of background on the guild. I should also be able to insert links here, to say reddit or the guild website. If /wiki can open a browser window, why can't I add a URL to do the same?

* **MOTD**

The character limit on this is a joke. Couple that with the fact that I need the above information to be included in every single MOTD, what's the purpose of a MOTD if it doesn't ping when players log in. I have little to no motivation to update it knowing that people may or may not see what I put there. It should ping when you login as well as when it's changed. That's pretty basic, imo.

* **Last Online**

Self explanatory. My guild has very lax rules (we have people that have been inactive since 3 weeks after launch and I still refuse to boot them), but since I don't require rep I really don't mind not having that.

* **Login Notification** (thanks u/downfalleclipse)

Even if it's just an option you can toggle on or off

* **Message suppression**

If I'm trying to send personal messages to my guildies congratulating them on a promotion, I should not be suppressed after 2 god damn messages. I understand the need for suppression, but it seriously needs to either go away or be **severely** relaxed when messaging people in the same guild.

* **Communication**

Communication is everything in a guild. I should be able to send a mass mail message to all my guildies if I need to so that I don't have to wait for them to all log in and keep track of who I sent mail to already. Put limits on it if you have to, or gold, just give us an option. Also, as a guild leader who doesn't require rep, please allow us to see guild chat no matter if we're representing or not. Or at least give us an option to do so. This would solve so many damn problems it's ridiculous.

* **Calendar**

FFS

----

These are just some of the most basic things that are desperately needed for guild management. There are others that would be nice as well

* **Player notes**

The ability to add RL names

* **Officer chat**

An officer channel would be nice to have.

* **Better rank permissions**

Why Admin lower ranks includes ""promote"" and ""kick"" in one option still baffles me. What if I want an officer rank that can recruit new members and promote lower ranked members

* **Crafting requests**

I think it'd be pretty cool, which would allow me to send that player the mats (or gold if I didn't have the mats) needed for the exact amount of bars I needed so that that member could make them for me.

This weekend I managed to get to level 31

**First and foremost**: opponents get stronger. Veterans are so much more common. Champions are a regular deal here. You *need* to use crowd control on them, but that's different).
Dodging is now a requirement. Not dodging final blows will usually get you down, it felt like level 1 - 20 were a tutorial (even though the motto is: the endgame is everywhere). 


**Secondly**: traits start to kick in, as an Elementalist with staff, I could make a *huge* impact on what kind of buffs people received. For example: just putting an electrical field in front of the boss would easily get him around ten stacks of vulnerability (especially when you are with a large amount of people). Add a firewall to that (giving burning to projectiles and might to other finishers), and the outgoing damage of your group increases severely.

On top of this come traits. The points alone make a huge difference in the way your character plays. I played with power and precision (as many have, it made movement and dodging a lot more important.


**Third:** hearts get *less* important

Luckily, where I spent infinitely more time doing the events and exploring than I spent completing hearts. More than often the dynamic events helped hearts in some way, causing me to completing them without even realizing.

* Harvest everything you see
* Try to not level crafting skills till you get to level 50+
* Do WvW but only to get full zone completion
* Cooking buffs are amazing
* Try and level with friends or in a group/zerg as much as possible
* Try and do dungeons at the right level
* Have one AoE weapon and one single target weapon
* Check karma vendors (hearts) for upgrades all the time
* If you don't mind missing out on some gear try waiting till level 70+ to do full map completions. The xp you get will always be 10% of your level so it's better to do it at higher levels when the content is harder.
* Explore a lot
* If you're solo don't try to do hearts/dynamic events that are 3+ levels higher than you are
* Personal story is not that great for xp but its a lot of fun and worth doing
* Clear farms that are in zones your level (or even a few levels lower)
* Don't worry if you have to go back to other lower level zones to level
* Rez everyone (even ranger pets) the xp from reviving someone is great and you're helping some one out.
* If you have extra mats sitting in your collection but can't use them for your profession
* Weapon rune's that give +(3/5/7/) damage on kill and stack to 25 are amazing for making things go a lot faster.
* Skills that give you bonus move speed are amazing to help you get from place to place faster.

I've found that underwater combat is frustrating for a number of reasons.

1. Underwater skills' damage is insanely useless. The ""1"" skill for my trident deals about a third the up-front damage that my scepter deals

2. Aggro - most of the underwater skills (at least for necro trident) are some form of aoe. Usually I would say ""hey great, and often, while pulling 1 enemy, I end up pulling a few more, leading to my death.

3. The underwater skills and movement just suck. I wish I could just have my land-based skills when underwater. They're much more useful and they do more damage. The underwater skills for necro are pretty useless considering that you can't really kite effectively underwater. Kiting underwater is near-impossible because there are enemies fucking EVERYWHERE in a full 3D radius

I hope nobody minds that I made a new thread not even a day later. Things have slowed down in my other thread and I doubt those would commented (and would probably appreciate) would visit again. If it's frowned upon by the mods I will take care to space out my posts next time. :)

Just a little painting I did during my lunch break at work. The idea came to mind and it felt too cute to not paint. Hope you all like it. :)

1332708927.0,rd4zj,"I played 18 hours of World PvE in the beta. Here are my impressions (Long, Detailed).",,694,152,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/rd4zj/i_played_18_hours_of_world_pve_in_the_beta_here/

**My Beta Experience:**
I got the chance to play the beta for approx 18 hours. I played a Human Warrior to around level 18 exclusively in World PvE. I did not play any PvP or WvW or personal storyline. I did not run any dungeons (I tried to

**My MMO Background:**

I was a hardcore PvE WoW player for about 5 years. I started at the beginning of Burning Crusade and quit just as the Firelands were released. I raided anywhere from 1 to 6 nights a week for at least 4 hours a night throughout my ""career"". I had 4 different level 85s (so I know what it is like to level in WoW) and had three high end raiding characters. I played a Shadow Priest for DPS



**The Environment:**

The world has such an amazing feel. The environments are vast and beautiful. The entire world feels alive and it is extremely easy to become entirely immersed in the game. The game's sense of scale does not really carry in the videos you've all seen. It is a world that truly has to be played. I don't think I can state enough how pretty this game is. The NPCs and players blend seamlessly. If it weren't for the names above the players' heads

**Graphics and Performance:**

I played on two different machines. A high end gaming computer with a high end ATI graphics card

**Combat:**

One of the largest criticisms I've seen on this subreddit is that the combat is boring and mind numbing. I would simply say in response, you don't use your AOE. If there are many, you don't use a single target attack. If they are close, you don't charge. If they are far, you don't swing. This game is all about timing, combos and situation usefulness. It has a much more action oriented feel to it. If you enjoy rushing around, lining up shots to hit multiple enemies, blocking and positioning this game will be a blast. I literally played with the same weapon set for 5 hours in a row and NEVER got sick of it. 

**Enemy AI:**

As I primarily played PvE, a ranged enemy with a torch. An engineer with grenades and a boss enemy that immobilizes and stuns you. It was rare for me to fight 1v1. It felt like I was always fighting at least 2 or 3 enemies at a time. I think that the mob AI was significantly better than what I experienced in WoW.

**Dynamic Events and ""Heart"" Areas:**

Guild Wars 2 does not have a lot of structure. There are no quest chains. They do not tell you where to play at all. This can make you feel a little lost at first if you are used to playing other MMOs. I felt like I didn't know where to go a lot. After a few hours this feeling completely disappeared. I felt free to do whatever I thought felt fun. It was very fluid. I could say ""Oh I think I'll go explore over here"" and then I'd get sidetracked escorting a caravan of supplies. You simply play the game. It is an absolute blast. The way the PvE plays out is that you have ""heart"" areas that are persistent to you. These areas give you a few different objectives that you can do to help the area out. These range from killing things, to erasing graffiti off the side of buildings. Once you finish the area, it remains finished forever. There are ~15 to 20 of these areas per zone. It is a good way to tell when you've completed a zone. While you are doing these ""heart"" events, dynamic events pop up on your map. These are things like villages getting attacked or caravans that need escorting. Some are even giant world bosses coming into existence. People absolutely FLOCK to the events whenever they are going on. It was so much fun to be helping a little village out when a HUGE army of centaurs would rush in and tons of other players would rush over and help defend. The scaling was fantastic. I never felt like it was too easy to beat the events. One criticism is that the particle effects made it difficult to see what was going on when there were a large number of people around. I do hope ANet does something about this. The dynamic events are cyclical in nature, you can also fail them (which feels awful by the way). If you fail, there are consequences. Suppliers are unavailable, you may not be able to get your gear repaired, the game is as hard as you want it to be. A level 16 vs 16 in a 1v1 fight is a little boring. To remedy this I played in areas that were at least 2 to 3 (sometimes more) levels higher than me and fought against more than one enemy at the same time. This provided a challenging and fun experience that was genuinely difficult. I died at least 10 times in my 18 hours of play and every single one was my fault. If you are skilled

**Travel:**

The transportation system in this game is the best I've ever played. It is fast, but I only used it occasionally. You really can wander great distances without even realizing it.

On a whim, so I had no idea what to expect. I come from a long WoW love-hate background, and lately I've been playing MOBAs. I open up the game, take about an hour deciding on every little feature I want my Sylvari to have, and bam, start loving the game from the start. As a matter of fact, I enjoy the game so much (mind you, that I decide to tell anyone and everyone I know they should play it!

One of my friends, running through some story quests, and leveling up to about 7, he's having a blast. Granted, he hardly knows what the hell he's doing and just likes zooming around as lightning (he's playing Ele), he's enjoying himself and it's making for a good time (as opposed to him getting raged at in League of Legends, haha). 

So, when I finish up a heart and some NPC dialogue goes on. I'm just standing around, watching him finish the heart. He's running to sweep up what (he thinks) will be his last puddle of ooze, when it starts moving. Over Skype, I hear ""Hey bro, I can't pick up this last puddle. I think it's glitched"". At this point, I'm thinking he is just being a noob and not clicking the right area. Wrong.

Out of nowhere, he is still trying to pick up the ooze on the floor. After realizing there is, in fact, a giant monster next to him, he frantically panics and starts running while saying ""Ahhh oh my god there is a giant blob here"". Then, my poor friend thinks it will be as simple as killing any ordinary monster. He proceeds to get one shotted, over, and over again. Meanwhile, when out of nowhere, and proceeds to tell me that it was one of the most awesome things he's ever done on a computer game.

1349794064.0,11747j,Jumping puzzles in GW2 - a discussion &amp; guide,dulfy,649,109,156,"Hey everyone

**What are Jumping Puzzles?**

Think of them as elaborate hidden vistas - some of them are even part of certain vistas! You can find them in almost every leveling zone (there are some exceptions) and Lion's Arch. Certain zones like Caledon Forest

There are two types of jumping puzzles: Regular jumping puzzles that provides achievements and mini jumping puzzles that do not provide any achievements (only a couple of those exist). 

Completing each of those regular puzzles will reward you with an achievement

**Jumping puzzle difficulty**

Jumping puzzles vary in difficulty and length. Some are super simple and short while others are long and feature difficult jumps. If you are just starting with jumping puzzles, you will be able to gauge what distances your character can and cannot jump, how to make really long jumps, and improve your finger dexterity. 

If you are really bad at those jumping puzzles, some people will have some puzzles easier than others so your experience may not agree with my.

You only need to represent the guild while you are trying to find a group

By the way


Ask for invites mailing to ""Souto.2157"" in game or whisper [only when i’m online]

(Mail invites can take a while to be accepted


--------------------------


P.S: U can be on any server for this since u can join dungeon with persons of other servers!!

P.S²: You can be in more than one Guild

--------------------------

Update 30/09

I got a LOT of mails asking for invites.

After hitting the 300 members for some reason all invites sent got cleared before i apply for larger guild licence. Some people that didn't got invite need to re-send!

I notice one thing

There is a limit of how many guilds u can be part of. The limit is FOUR guilds... This seems quite a low number IMO

Mail asking for invites means i had to type each name to invite this lead to a delay on invites!

All members can invite player to guild!

BTW right now there is  300 members.

I am upgrading the guild size as soon the game let me increase (I think the guild need to be very close to the limit to get the upgrade

Next and last upgrade to 500 members will be expensive LOL

Update 01/10

We are almost at the limit members in guild.
A lot of people that ask for invite didn't accepted yet

1347381042.0,zpr38,All my knowledge - Part 5,koranuso,704,166,65,"**UPDATED 9-11-12**

*This post will be split into two sections. The first will go over how to get the most bang for your buck when trying to see all of the storylines. The second will explain how to group with other players. I will also add some common issues with completing certain quests and zones at the end.*

**1. Characters

There are a bunch of minor storylines in the game. These are decided during your character creation. There are 3 per race and these minor storylines last up until level 30. The storys are unique even within the same race.

At level 30 (of the story not necessarily your character level) you are forced to choose between 1 of 3 Orders that are fighting against the elder dragons. Vigil

If you want to experience the majority of the story from all side here is what you can do. 

Make 5 characters (1 from each race and profession doesn't matter).

Level these 5 all the way up to the level 30 personal quest to experience one of each races minor storylines. 

At that point you can pick your 3 favorite characters and then have them choose a different Order for each. 

Now you will have 3 characters and can explore the entire major storyline up to Zhaitan and see all the different perspectives. 

There are a few more choices along the way

**2. Completing storyline with friends.**

Arenanet did a really good job with this. Not only can you join your friends in their storyline

I'll try to explain this better.

Say I am on my level 40 Vigil personal story quest and so is my buddy. My quest is called ""Happy Quest"" because I am Asura and his is called ""Sad Quest"" because he is a Human. These two quests are exactly the same despite the name because they are at the same level. 

Now if we were to join a party together and go to the same map the quest is on

At the END of the quest. He would of course complete it and get his reward BUT I would be given a prompt with 2 choices. 

**Choice 1:** The game will ask me if I would like to continue on his ""Sad Quest"" story in which case I would also receive the quest reward and move on to the next level personal quest.

**Choice 2:** I can choose the option to stay on my level 40 ""Happy Quest"". I won't receive the end of quest reward but I will be able to complete the quest again either by myself or with him in the party. I would be the one to start the quest next time though.

My buddy and I would usually swap who started every other quest so we both got to see our characters in the cutscenes. 

Now I have not completed the very final storyline quest (won't say which). But I get the impression that all 3 Order storylines will converge and that final quest will be the same for everyone no matter what choices you made. Will have to wait and see when I can get a group for it. 

**Questing Tidbits**

Occasionally

When this happens just try again the next day after server reset. Arenanet is catching these sort of bug very quickly and pushing out patches each night. 

The same thing applies to zone completion. Occasionally you will find a skill point NPC that just won't fight you no matter how many times you insult his mother. If you just wait till the next day it will usually be functional by then. 

There are also reports that a Guardian with a staff can use his ~~pull~~ number 5 skill on the NPC to unlock them. I haven't verified that myself but it seems to be common knowledge in Orr. I know for a fact it doesn't work every time for every stuck NPC though. 

**From Seras_V**

*I can confirm that the guardian's 5th staff skill (Line of Warding) can be used to fix at least one bugged skill point
It doesn't always work though. It doesn't seem to affect most friendly NPCs I tried it on. For the friendly NPCs it does work on
Also some events can be fixed with resurrection skills. There was an event where the NPCs needed to be protected

That's about it for now. As always

This is just a quick post to update you on a new rule that we're going to be implementing

&gt; Dear ArenaNet

The above example doesn't promote discussion at all, vote and move onto the next thing. 

One way to improve the quality of the subreddit is to improve the usage of titles

&gt; How could the Necromancer be changed to become viable?

Everyone knows that ArenaNet read and contribute to this subreddit but that doesn't mean that your suggestions will be seen

[**You can find the official suggestion forum here**](https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/game/suggestions).

This, you can click on the show details button below to see how to acquire it, trading post prices, links to wiki page and gw2db/guildhead (gw2spidy and gw2db is having some issues where they are linking pages of unique exotic greatswords with names of generic exotic greatswords but the stats and prices are all correct)

Included also is a table with PvP Locker weapon name to PvE name conversion. I managed to nail all of them down save for the one of two with repeated names. 

I think I got all of the greatsword skins save for the super basic skin and Eternity (which is just Twilight at night and Sunrise at day). If there are any skins I left out please let me know!

I think I will be working on staff next since is something that my mesmer can use as well.

I couldn't believe his luck.  So I did what any respectable father would do:  I swallowed nervously as a bead of sweat rolled down my cheek and said, but it never runs out.  Can Daddy trade you some mini pets and a gold piece for it?""

He said ""Sure!"" and I quickly transferred the bell over to one of my characters.  I completed the transaction by giving him a few mini pets and the gold I had promised.  But my son is sharp and noticed how enthusiastic I was.  And even though he is only 6 he said

Also Droknars Forge has sunk. 

Update:

http://i.imgur.com/rv8dG.png

Seems that high level dungeons were being tested internally. 

More rumors (take in with grain of salt): 

The ""Mystic Forge"" (found inside Lion's Arch) is used to make some of the most rarest-high-level items. Many of it's recipes are a total mystery. 

The game is pretty close to finishing

Asura zones/quests are coming along pretty fast. Sylvari zones lag you like a mother----- (framerate issues)

So a list of 'big stuff' needing some work to make it readyish for release:

- Sylvari zones optimization

- Structured PvP being finished (still in development)

- Content (lot of quest logs etc missing and tagged with weird numbering like QEB82E and high level zones seem to miss some hearts and such.)

There's only 4 structured PvP maps in atm, which is a coastal map with a huge pirate ship, water and beaches. 

Obviously you can't just walk up to the guildlord and kill it easily. It takes time to get to him even

Pirate map

- narrow bayish coast with capture points on each side

- Pirate ship in the middle of the two capture points

- Capture point under the pirate ship

- Pirate ship has cannons.

- Caribbeanish setting.


Memories of the past

- 3 capture points

- Each team has a fort

- Killing guild lord win you the game

- Grassish setting.

I'm not the only one.  There are others like me, in which case I feel justified switching to my SoL weapon.  There are no damage or healing or tanking meters in this game, and there's no way to inspect, so with transmutating a magic find leech is identical to a respectable player.

Why do I leech?  Because even though I slow down the dungeon run by wearing MF gear, well overall that's a win for me, even if it's a loss for the rest of my party.

This is exactly the set-up of the prisoners dilemma.  I don't know what thought-process led the designers to create a game where leeching is the dominant strategy

I think the system is stupid, and I'll probably get downvoted for speaking the truth, but why does the game even allow people to be leeches?  Much less ENCOURAGE them to leech?

I've seen a lot of concerns raised here about how and where to prepurchase the Collector's Edition before it sells out


**Retailers accepting reservations before April 10**

The street date of prepurchase keys is April 10. Any retailer who distributes them before then is breaking the street date and risks losing their allocation of keys. When we become aware of retailers not abiding by a street date

However
http://news.mmosite.com/content/2010-01-25/guild_wars_2_preorder_starts.shtml

A reservation is not the same as a prepurchase. If you previously placed a reservation

We appreciate the community's efforts to keep us informed about what's happening in their countries. Keep doing so and we'll do our best to resolve issues with retailers and distributors.


**Amazon.com**

I know many of you are disappointed that your local Amazon site isn't offering prepurchases of the Collector's Edition. In order to support prepurchase of Collector's Edition, and we've reallocated their units to other retailers.

Since individual Amazon markets have different systems and policies

If you're just looking to prepurchase the game from Amazon and don't need the Collector's Edition

I won't lie: the first time you PvP it feels like a great big mess.  The upgrade to level 80 opens up a truckload of choices and the combat will drown you in particle effects.  You're going to feel confused

This guide is to help you more quickly overcome the first-time confusion.  To help you reach the point where you can look at combat and say to yourself, what talents to choose, or the strategy to win games.  Instead, this guide explains the fundamentals.  Issues like: how animation-based combat functions, what to know about buffs and debuffs, and how the map mechanics work.  For those players who have already experienced a great deal of PvE content, some of this will sound very basic.  I apologize for that

This is a lengthy guide.  You may not want to read all of it at once, as that seems to cause the most confusion when players start.  After that, go by the index.  You can search for a section by its header (1-A, or 2-C, and so forth) to quickly pinpoint the topic location.  Find the topic you need help with and read on.

I wish you all the best of luck.

&gt; 0: **The Three Golden Rules of PvP:**

Rule #1:  **Keep your health in mind and take regular breaks away from the game.**  Go on a walk, check in on your kids/pets/significant other.  The game will be here when you get back.  Your body will thank you.

Rule #2:  **You will die, see rule #1.

Rule #3:  **Be nice to other players.**  It is our responsibility to build a community worth joining.  Insults and rage-tantrums bring it down for everyone.  If you cannot muster the energy to stay positive

1359616601.0,17m9jt,I never thought I'd say this but... Orr is kind of really awesome now.,Rytlock,609,93,171,"I don't see too many people discussing this

The thinned mobs is probably the biggest deal

Additionally, are much more pleasing to look at now! The increased loot from mobs is also awesome. Heavy Moldy Bags drop at an extremely nice rate now. Additionally, the Champion Abomination from the Plinx chain also got a model update (along with every other abomination). Not only is he amazingly huge now, but he also got a skill update where he does a charge and downs people if they get hit (very entertaining... reminds me of the Karka barrel roll on a smaller scale, and helped me get my daily healer!).

The updated Temple Bosses is also great. The Grenth fight feels much better (though can be frustratingly hard when Pugs seem to pull the Priest to Keeper)

The temple icons throughout Orr truly showcase the unique mechanics the Orr maps have. It's really nice to have a visual on how taking down a temple boss can affect Orr. I never really realized how widespread each temple bosses' influence could be. Before, really bring out that unique flavor.

I can now see how Arenanet intended for Orr to really be that end-game guild get-together / push to Arah kind of ordeal. It still isn't there, but it also gives me hope that Arenanet can create zone maps with a unique feel. I feel the newly added temple icons really help. It's very DoA (Domain of Anguish)-ish with the regional effects.

What are your thoughts on the newly improved Orr?

**tl;dr**

1) Putrifiers no longer pull my ass every foot I move.

2) Updated models make Risen much more pleasing to look at. 

3) New boss mechanics are fun

4) Improved loot and ease to run from event to event makes Orr feel much more rewarding. Also

5) Temple icons spread throughout map really adds flavor.

6) It's great to see regular people out in the open world again.

7) I no longer hate Risen as much as Teemo

Combined with invisibility and teleportation skills for some classes, skills like the portal are extremely powerful. Mesmers have gotten really good at coordinating this and created a de-facto way of defending or attacking.

Also everything I say is my opinion and speculation, as I argue below. 

This is in my opinion one of the largest design flaws by ANet with respect to PvE. I've always thought this, CoF1 has spread many players' misconceptions of profession viability and value, and CoF1 has become the whore everyone does over and over because it's the cheapest and best -- and you can bet there are symptoms. Reasoning for both? See circle zerk.

There have been MANY patches since launch where ANet has attempted to limit and prevent players from farming. Each time a dynamic event chain/zone had its spawn numbers decreased, more people have been found themselves heading over to CoF.

ANet, but excluding WvW/PvP, there is definitely a cap on that. Once you've soloed GL and hit the kitten wall at FOTM 50 (WWWWWHHHHYYYYY???), there's not much else that non-WvW PvE offers for its hardcore crowd. 

So there will likely be a point where players decide to get nice-looking gear for their characters. There were originally many options for making money. Orr was crowded, socialize, and the community would slowly get built together as events scaled horribly and provided fun challenges for the large zergs. Then came the balance patches -- I'll spare the nostalgia of the old Plinx and penitent/shelter days. Each time, there were fewer and fewer people in Orr, and more and more LFG posts for CoF.

Players adapted, Orr was relatively dead, much like its original inhabitants. It's quite ironic. ANet tries to add incentives to get players back into the beautiful world they've designed, and at the same time uses negative reinforcement to keep them out of it. Again -- players will ALWAYS take the least path of resistance to fulfill their goals, and if you remove it, they will find another. It will not be as optimal, but players will do it. Yet CoF1 never devalues (asides from inflation). Hence, and fewer will actually play the other 99% of content.

Wonder why players are quitting the game under the perception that there's nothing to do at end-game? Here's the brutal truth -- this game's not as fun when you're the only one on the map. This game's not as fun when players start thinking this is all that people do. This game's not as fun when you ask if anyone in guild chat wants to run FOTM, it's not worth the hour+ for a 48 run."" CoF1 has created a ""standard"" for earnings simply because it is so far above everything else. As such, other activities lost value in the general public's eye, and fewer people opt to do them in lieu of opportunity cost. Yea, it's sad that people don't want to have clean fun in this game, but realistically that shouldn't be a surprise when there ARE nifty rewards that just cost a few hundred gold. And like skritt -- SHINY!

But of course

Originally, this translated into other classes being perceived by the majority of [ignorant] players as useless or wholly inefficient/incapable. This attitude has pervaded the entirety of PvE end-game. Some take it to further extremes than others -- kicking rangers/necros/engis -- but there are also those who convey prejudice by asking, ""If they have another alt."" Granted there are MANY profession-specific bugs, but overall this negative bias is not primarily due to a design flaw. It's due to people allowing the CoF mentality to prevent them from understanding how every profession CAN bring a lot to the table, and that skill is a better requisite than a gear check or choice of profession. This attitude will not change soon, as it has become deeply rooted and continues to perpetuate as the CoF1 circle zerk goes around for another loop. For those who want to speed run, there will always be an optimal composition, every class is viable.

--

Of course, and hence in their minds, is considered a relative waste of time. People used to espouse the idea that ANet didn't want people to grind or farm. But that's kitten shit. Pull up gw2lfg and search for the word 'farm' and see how many of those correspond with CoF1.

CoF1 IS broken, and has only taken action to make it more profitable. Hence, fixing it will result in SEVERE backlash from many in the community. I didn't even mention how CoF1 has affected the economy in the grand scheme, but there will certainly be a change -- whether in the perceived worth in the coin (inflation/deflation), the price of objects, or more likely -- the reallocation (read: concentration) of wealth into the hands of fewer and fewer. 

I'm the biggest GW2 fanboy and I love WvW (now that I've reached what I perceive as the PvE end-game skill cap). I have stopped caring about cosmetics or money. I have used the skins from my personal story line for almost 700 hours now, I really do, and will likely continue to play for much longer. But I represent a very small minority of players who can content and enjoy themselves with that. 

CoF1 is broken

Edit3: Loving the discussion! Some comments clearly didn't read through my tower of text though, but stopped when I realized it was ruining my personal experience with the game. The reason why I care about CoF1 then is because it has consequences on the greater community! With how lucrative CoF1 is, and given ANet's constant nerfs in the explorable world, there are fewer and fewer people populating zones. That's one reason why I care. The second reason is that when I do go back to do dungeons, and this IS anecdotal, but it's becoming more rare to run with certain classes. When I host a party for a FOTM run, I'm either asked to switch onto my mesmer or guardian, but there are always those one or two who quit if they don't get war/mes/guard, there are fewer people LFG or hosting parties.

**Last Night's Update**

* We largely resolved the capacity constraints with parties and guild functionality, and guild manipulation not working. Note that, while capacity constraints are now addressed, there are still some specific issues we're working on with parties and guilds. In particular, there's an issue with parties not staying together as they travel into dungeons, which we plan to address tonight.
* We fixed issues with the storyline steps ""Fury of the Dead
* We changed the downed mode camera to maintain a more consistent distance taking race into account.


**Tonight's Update**

* We'll fix the issue with parties not staying together as they travel into dungeons.
* We'll fix issues with the storyline steps ""A Light in the Darkness,"" ""Rumors of Trouble,"" ""The Lost Chieftain's Return,"" and ""Tribunes in Effigy.""
* We'll add an option to stop queueing for your home world
* We'll add an option to report an account for sending spam or otherwise inappropriate in-game mail. *Edit: This option will be added in tomorrow night's update


**Coming Soon**

* Some players' monthly achievements didn't correctly reset on September 1 at 00:00 GMT. To allow those players to collect the next monthly reward
* We're working on a fix for PvP tournament rewards.


**Trading Post**

Trading Post item and gold delivery was slow for part of the day today due to a network connectivity issue between data centers. Delayed gold and items are being delivered; check your ""pick up"" tab.


**Gem Purchases**

We found some cases where players didn't receive items after purchasing them on the gem store. We have records of all occurrences and are in the process of refunding gems to all affected players. Note that refunded gems will simply be added to your account's gem balance.


**Reporting exploits**

If you discover an emergency game-breaking or economy-breaking bug, note that we cannot respond individually to emails to this address.


**Worlds &amp; Overflow**

We're increasing world capacity as necessary to handle all the new players coming into the game.

During this initial surge of high concurrency, form a party together, then right-click on the friend's portrait in the party list and click ""join"". We expect the use of overflow servers to naturally subside as players spread out more through the world.

Upon arriving in Cursed Shore

It was then that my party realized I was level 6 and began to shout at me about why I was here. I tried to explain that I ran all the way to Cursed Shore to help the fight against Zhaitan but it was to no avail. They yelled and abandoned me

I remain resolute. The wargs and spiders could not stop me from doing what I can to help fight Zhaitan. I can outrun a centaur and I will not rest until my Dull Blade runs black in the blood of undead. No amount of angry allies will stop me from aggroing everything and triumphing in order to fulfill my duty as a warrior to protect Tyria.

You may run into me on the Maguuma Server hitting Zhaitan's minons for that extra 1 damage on a crit. Every point of damage matters in this fight.

1. Don't salvage everything! Blue level 80s can vendor for almost a silver a piece and greens go for about double. Salvaging is useful for obtaining materials that can't be gathered (leather

2. You can travel to Lions Arch for free from anywhere by entering the mists

3. Low level crafting materials you have left over from leveling can actually go for quite a lot on the trading post. Check the prices frequently.

4. Do World vs World. Contrary to what seems like common opinion

5. Follow event chains. The longer you follow a chain, the more loot you get. Wait around after you finish an event in the later zones. With the exception of defending bases, almost every single event in Orr either has a follow up or is part of a larger chain.

6. Fast travel as little as possible within the zone itself. Even if you're standing next to the waypoint it'll still cost you around a silver and change.

7. When using the trading post, but you can save a lot of silver.

8. Explorable dungeons are the opposite of WvW. They are huge moneysinks at the moment

9. Crafted items are probably the most cost effective rare level 80 armor/weapons. The karma vendors charge a lot and the specific weapons/armor from each of the Orders (Whispers, you can generally get a good deal if you supply the crafter with the fine crafting components (blood, scales, etc)

10. Magic find food is cheap and will greatly increase your gold income once you start selling items instead of salvaging them.

I was looking at everyone's opinions on the most recent changes to dungeon rewards and their relationship with DE reward reduction and item drop caps. While I was reading through the posts I noticed there was a great deal of misinformation floating around.

With this in mind

~~~~~

**Diminishing Returns Information for Item Drops**

We don't have any facts reported by the Arenanet staff on this system, so if you keep moving to new areas while killing the same enemy type (im looking at you centaurs) you should also be unaffected.

**Diminishing Returns Information for Dynamic Event Rewards**

We don't have any facts reported by the Arenanet staff on this system. Reported findings point to a reduction in the reward for all events if too many events are completed in a certain time period. This time period and the number of events required to trigger the code are still unclear.

**Diminishing Returns Information for Dungeon Rewards**

Jon Peters

Let me clarify the change a bit since not everyone understands it.
If you run the exact same chain twice in a row you will have your rewards cut. This means you can bounce back and forth between 2 different chains
If you speed clear dungeons at a rate of more than 2/ hour
Finally we reduced the value of repeating the story mode

[Link to Jon's post on Official Forums](https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/game/dungeons/Dungeon-Updates/page/3#post154925)

~~~~~

Now that we have that out of the way lets talk about these mechanics.

**Item Drop DR**

Drop caps are carried over from Guild Wars 1. In Guild Wars 2 they operate in a similar manner, etc were unaffected. Don't expect to see this changed or removed. This code worked wonders in Guild Wars 1 for reducing the attractiveness of botting and Arenanet has little incentive to remove something that has been so effective.

Many players complain that that this anti-botting code unjustly prevents them from doing whatever they like. Farming a single mob for hours and hours is not actually a problem for the economy, use different skills and tactics, and can handle the many problems that can occur (being downed/dead/getting knocked off course). However these activities are easy for a human. All arenanet is forcing players to do is use their reasoning and skills to get around their code. Think of it as captcha, but implemented in an unobtrusive way that encourages variety.

**Dynamic Event Reward DR**

The purpose of this code is different from the drop DR. The drop DR is difficult to be affected by if you are not farming mats. Dynamic Event DR is in the game to prevent exploitation of DEs that are very close together on the map that happen to occur near the same time. The problem is there are some quest chains that happen in quick enough succession that this code can be triggered. This is obviously a stop gap measure while Arenanet fixes the game to prevent players from exploiting any Dynamic Events that they have yet to properly time out and balance. This code may stay in the game for the long run

**Dungeon Reward DR**

This new anti-farming counter measure is the catalyst for recent discussion of these mechanics and for my writing of this article. Lets look at player and developer motives to try to come to an understanding on this issue.

Arenanet wants you to play their content. They spent years creating it and it would be an absolute shame for 66% of their dungeon content to be completly ignored.

Players want dungeon armor. They want it as quickly as the game allows them to get it.

So here is the problem

The answer is that you make each path equally appealing and efficient for the player. Then

In summary, and players who do figure our ways to do dungeons in under thirty minutes are being discouraged until Arenanet can find and fix the exploits that allow this to happen.

~~~~~

Players are never forced to be inactive by these mechanics. If you experience drop DR, so you can adventure as you please. And now it should be obvious to you how to completely avoid Dungeon DR. Alternate between two or more explorable paths and don't use exploits that trivialize the content.

It is important that these counter measures are put in place in the meantime to prevent inflation in the markets. If one small group of players finds a technique to become super rich

I hope this article helps those who lacked understanding of these issues

**TLDR; Many of the new mechanics meant to affect player behavior are stop gaps until better systems can be found. Please be patient while Arenanet solves these difficult issues.**

""Hey you!"" 

Hello there and thank you for joining this discussion. Let me begin by saying that I'm really looking forward to playing Guild Wars 2. I enjoyed the BWE a lot.

The PVE was fresh and for the first time since

The World vs World system was a dream come true

Surely both the PVE

Q: *""Oh but surely nobody cares about chat

A: If this was a game like Gears of War 3, it's an persistant world MMORPG. And in such a game the chatsystem is the tool by which we communicate, and communication is the lifeblood of the MMORPG. It is what sets it apart from the single player world. It is what creates the impression that you are part of a living breathing world with real people who inhabit it, instead of silent ghosts who just press buttons. It is what creates the community, and the sub communities which make these MMO's so wonderful and addicting. 

** The current chat system is an insult to this otherwise wonderful and spectacular game. ** 

Basically
 

**Some of the issues with it.** 

- Ugly. 

- Highly inflexible. No option to change colors

- Bugged. Of course /team was bugged as reported and there where tons of bugs with whispers

- /local is not local

- lack of a real /say and /yell chat. 

A short range chat is needed to communicate with people in your direct vicinity. Whether that is to talk to a group your just doing a quest with, a short range chat is a necessity. 

It is even more of a necessity in this game because what GW2 does is it allows you to play alone while still playing in groups. In other words, you now need a /say even more. You need a way to easily get the attention of some passerby, both in PVE with its dynamic quests and in WvW where sometimes a small team can make things happen. You need a ""hey you!"" in this game more then in other games. 


- chatbubbles
This really is the follow up to a /say chat. In order to easily pinpoint where text is coming from, its everyone that can find use for them. To speak to people around them, to ask for help (and get response too because people in the vicinity see who it is that is calling) and many other things. 

Arenanet has indicated that GW2 wouldn't be released until ""It's done"". In my opinion, this next generation game should have a chat system at least as advanced as WoW (a 7 year old game with a chatsystem that makes GW2 current chatsystem look like it's from the stone age). But I'd be thrilled if they took the extra step to make it even better (but not counting on it). 

So let yourself be heard. Do you agree here

I've also made a thread on their official forums about this

https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/game/suggestions/Chatbubbles/page/1

Let's make ourselves heard now and make sure that this AAA quality game doesn't launch with a third rate chatsystem that acts as a barrier to your ability to communicate with people around you. Let's make sure that this game is launched with a chat system that at its bare minimum is comparable with the chat system of last generations AAA games. A game that makes communicating with the people around you a joy instead of a gamble.

###TESTED


**Does condition damage affect Mesmer illusions?**

&gt; Yes, both damage ticks decreased accordingly. This also means stats are taken from the character at time of damage, not the time the bleed was applied.

**Does condition duration stack linearly? From only some sources or from all?**

&gt; Yes

**Do fractional amounts of condition duration give any benefit for bleeds?**

&gt; It does not seem so. By that I mean

**Who does the ""remove condition"" combo remove conditions from?**

&gt; ""Remove Condition"" is done by projectile finishers

**For raw damage, Precision or Crit Damage**

&gt; For raw damage, stat parameters ingame are limited in range and you will not be able to spec 100% power. A full set of Berserker gear has the highest DPS most of the time. At times, high condition damage sets can do more damage in specific builds that have little plain damage.

**How do sigils on two different one handed weapons work?**

&gt; Both work, you can't use two of any on-crit sigils together. Bonuses apply to all skills on your character, not specific weapon skills.

**Whose condition damage value is used for guardian virtues**

&gt; Tested

**Whose condition damage value is used for combo field conditions?**

&gt; The stats of the person who used the finisher.

**How do stacked combo fields work?**

&gt; This seems to be a tricky one. Of course only one effect fires

**When using spirits

&gt; As the answers above: ally's stats.

**Is boon duration cumulative between players?**

&gt; It does not seem so

**Are diminishing returns gone?**

&gt; No. Certainly not on dungeons as can be easily verified.

**Optimal stacks of confuse to kill a heartseeker spamming thief?**

&gt; (WvW) At 1000 condition damage, you would need about  14-15 stacks to outright kill him. However, good luck applying anywhere over 10 stacks as you are being ganked.

**Will we ever see the results of this mythbusting effort?**

&gt; Up yours.




###PRESUMPTIONS / NOT TESTED


**To which ""family"" belong dungeons' monsters?**

&gt; ~~They belong to the corresponding sigil for that dungeon. e.g. all mobs in CoE count as Inquest.~~

**Does the Black Lion salvaging kit have a lower chance of giving Ectoplasm than a Master's kit?**

&gt; No reason or evidence to assume it is any lower. If anything

**Does more than 100% magic find appear to work?**

&gt; There is no reason to assume magic find is capped at 100%. 

**Does equipping a precursor make the legendary soulbound when created?**

&gt; Probably not.

**Does precision affect the critical chance of healing?**

I have found myself constantly changing the colours of my dye on my armour and I feel that this would add a whole new level of customisation for me and I'm sure quite a few of you agree.
The price for this should be quite substantial in my opinion

1373056194.0,1hplcj,The balance issues with GW2 are not on the player end,wayoverpaid,564,97,276,"I made this comment [elsewhere](http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/1hloge/warriors_you_cant_crit_world_bosses/cawbtzk?context=1)

Right now, Rangers don't get invited to dungeons, and no one runs a healer build.  And you'd be right, to an extent.  GW2 PvE is imbalanced because of the kinds of monsters we fight.

I mostly play sPvP now, pretty much every class is viable.  Some are a little more ""required"" than others, but you would never send 5 of one class in and expect to dominate.  This is because the trinity in sPvP is extremely well implemented.

GW2 has a Trinity, Burst, Condi, and AoE), Control (With a subset of CC and debuffs), and Support (with subsets of healing, damage boosting

These sets are finely balanced against one another.  Guardians, bunker, and pressure/DPS in a kind of rock/paper/scissors about who will beat whom.  There's no one true build, as it should be!

I run a low DPS guardian

The kinds of things we face in PvE though completely change the way we play.  Human players, they run away at low health if they can.  They swarm with greater numbers.  Sometimes they have to hold a chokepoint to let allies capture a point.

Monsters... aren't.

Let's look how the trinity fares when applied to the kinds of things you face in a typical dungeon run.  The dungeons I am MOST familiar with is CoF P1 and all the paths of CM.  Most of those are dominated by either big brutish bosses

Now let's talk damage.  DPS matters, that's reasonable.  Burst damage ends up being completely useless against monsters where the HP pool is large.  Burst damage is amazing against monsters who can heal.  Take the Blue/Red Lord in the Foefire sPvP map.  He has a self-heal that, if you hit with enough burst damage, he cannot use.  But silvers and higher have so much HP that burst damage is pointless -- might as well have brought DPS.

As far as condition damage goes

So we've already got two or three playstyles severely limited.  On big bosses, does nothing in a dungeon.  Condi damage is questionable at best.

DPS rules the day.

But there are still two other lets of the trinity.  What about support?

Support (at least offensive support) isn't totally unused. Those zerker warriors aren't just hitting, doesn't see much use though.  Why?  Probably because in an attempt to ensure you never need a healer, the game more or less ensures you never need defensive support.

Almost all attacks can be dodged.  Healing?  Well it's useful

And then we get to control. The way defiant works sucks. I understand why 80% of CC is intended to not land: because one boss versus five players means CC is five times as effective as a fair 5v5.  However what really happens is that players don't even bother.  Most big bosses can't be knocked back.  Most small monsters aren't worth CCing because there's nothing to CC them into.  CC tends to be a delaying tactic

Better to bring more damage

Thing is, but here's the thought.

First of all, with players hanging onto their best attacks until the very last moment.  Suddenly the thief tactic of HEARTSEEKER, HEARTSEEKER, HEARTSEEKER has some use inside the dungeon too.  Not for the whole fight, just when you see the self-heal about to proc.

This is stuff that will make the zerker warrios go ""that's bullshit!"" but I'm ok with that.

Bosses need to apply the occasional bits of damage or conditions which can't be stopped in a narrow radius around them.  Nothing which causes automatic death, OR withdrawing for a few seconds.  In this way, a healer increases effective DPS, but isn't strictly necessary.  Do you want 3 warriors wailing on the boss 70% of the time, or 2 warriors wailing on him 100% of the time?

Even better

Then we get to CC.

As much as players hate the ""guard this NPC while he tries to do something"" missions

Finally, bosses might have stability most of the time, but every now and then they fire off a highly powerful, difficult to dodge attack on the whole party. A second before they do it, they're in a ""windup"" phase where CC -- blindness, knockback, etc, so he can save the party instead of making them all withdrawn.

What if bosses dodged every now and then, just the one. CC doesn't stack in effectiveness.

I'm not saying we need and end to all DPS, a reason to bring CC and support healing.  Ideally, five zerkers should be able to finish the dungeon.  Support should not be mandatory.  CC should not be mandatory.  But a good control build should make DPS players go ""oh sweet, you can hit him before he does his telegraphed dodge, that means more damage for us!""

Again

**TL;DR** we have an abundance of one kind of enemy: a big dumb non-dodging non-healing single-target bag of hitpoints that ignores most CC and doesn't reliably apply conditions that players can't dodge.  If ANet would change the kinds of monsters that we face

**Edit:**  Everyone telling me that AR is an example of a dungeon which gets this more correct than before.  I'll give it a try with my sPvP team and see how that works out.

1376057570.0,1k0y6p,"After the Queen's Gauntlet, is it finally time to remove Defiant from the game?",Marstead,584,115,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/1k0y6p/after_the_queens_gauntlet_is_it_finally_time_to/

**What is Defiant?** Defiant is the mechanic where whenever a CC ability is used on a boss

**Why is it a problem?** There already is a way to trivialize content, combat becomes reactive (dodge attacks, stay out of red rings) instead of active.

**Why remove it now?** The Queen's Gauntlet and the open world QJ Champions really made me wonder--is this mechanic really necessary? Those bosses are quite difficult and challenging but do not have the Defiant mechanic at all, which is awesome.

**Reasons to remove Defiant**

* Defiant discourages skills that exclusively control enemies

* Defiant forces groups to focus on DPS and reactive play instead of active play.

* We already have large fights where parties &amp; zergs face off against other powerful enemies without Defiant--PvP &amp; WvW--and while chain stunning is a viable strategy it is in no way overpowered. We already know that this can work.

* The removal of Defiant can increase the complexity of Dungeon &amp; open world boss fights to require the use of CC and generally make them more fun, chain stunning the Windcaller to stop her from spawning so many whirlwinds, knocking back Chomper to keep him from getting to the meat for buffs). Every class has access to plenty of CC, many of them passive CC skills on their existing weapon loadouts they already use for DPS.

**Alternative to Removing Defiant**

* **Defiant doesn't appear until a certain number of CC moves are used on the same enemy within a certain window of time, etc)--with so many players it would be true that the the enemy would just be totally locked down without any active play from the players fighting it, they'd be using so many passive CC effects the boss would be totally disabled. Adding some kind of zerg check threshhold to trigger Defiant if too many CCs are used within say 3 seconds could continue to cover these bosses. The duration of Defiant could continue to increase as long as the same CCs/second continue to be used after the buff first appears, so this could add some strategy--go ahead and CC the boss, but if Defiant appears, stop CCing to let it wear off. 

The threshhold could be set low enough to keep the risk of triggering Defiant in smaller PvE fights like Dungeons; this would keep the active controlling play

* **Alter or Remove Defiant

**tl;dr: Defiant is an outdated mechanic that reduces build variety, it's becoming clear it's not really needed to keep the game balanced. It should be removed entirely or changed so that it triggers only when too many CCs are used at the same time, and then it should fade after time passes.**

I'm quite bored with the game and will give you my list of consumables

[Ash Legion Spy Kit](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ash_Legion_Spy_Kit): Purchased from Kyra Sharptracker in Plains of Ashford.  Let's start with the king of cheap consumables.  Pop this, they are very affordable.  Reviving a fallen ally in a dungeon?  Pop one.  I use them if I get locked in a knockdown combo by the Husks in Twilight Arbor.  They are especially annoying for opponents in WvW.  You shouldn't go down in small skirmishes in WvW as long as you have these.  The applications of such easily spammable invisibility are many. This combos well with other consumables and I'll touch more on that later.  Edit:  Does not work in WvW :(

[Ogre Pet Whistle](http://www.gw2db.com/items/62330-ogre-pet-whistle):  Purchased near Gladefall Run in Iron Marches.  This is decent.  Gives you a random ranger pet for 5 minutes.  Only one at a time but as soon as one goes down you can use another.  Edit:  There are some reports that the whistle is now gone

[Tier 5 Boon of Regeneration](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Boon_of_Regeneration):  Purchased near Breekeelee POI in Bloodtide Coast from Muirikroomk (underwater).  Gives you decent health regen and lasts quite a while

Experimental Teleportation Gun:  Purchased from an Asuran at the Valance Tutory WP, to become invisible while you're in the air.

[Miner's Explosive Charge](http://www.gw2db.com/items/50027-miners-explosive-charge):  Purchased from Dianna in Kessex Hills.  These are lots of fun.  Set it

[Charr Mine](http://www.gw2db.com/items/49696-charr-mine):  Purchased near Raintimber Mill in Diessa Plateau.  Applies a nice burn to enemies that step on these.  Very nice in condition damage builds and they're very cheap.  Why not set one before a difficult pull in a dungeon? 

[Seed Turret](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Seed_Turret):Purchased near the Thorp Waypoint in Caledon Forest.  Another good one to drop in or before a difficult fight.  Gives you 3 different options of turret-one heals

[Dam Debris](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dam_Debris):  Pick some up from Foreman Flannum in Queensdale.  Single target knockdown ability with no cooldown.  Enemies in Dungeons will become immune after the first knockdown.  Go piss off people in WvW with them.

Alright those are most of the consumables I use regularly.  There are a few others that I didn't mention but these I've found to be the most useful.  The process of quickly opening up your inventory and using these can be automated

1346216779.0,z07f4,A (former) hardcore WoW raider's perspective on GW2,spilurum,664,198,405,"First off, and stayed with that guild until I quit the game. I am one of those players that believes TBC was the pinnacle of the game, yeah

The game is, nearly perfect in every regard. Launch issues aside (even still extremely minor, it is easily the second smoothest MMO launch I have been a part of next to Rift), I haven't had this much fun in an MMO since 2005. 

* Skills that change based on your equipped weapon. Holy shit! This was a phenomenal idea. I have to say at first I was a bit skeptical being limited to only 5 skills at any given time, and the same 5 for 2hers, but I absolutely love playing around with 1h/oh combinations to find the perfect set of skills for a particular fight, and hot-swapping weapons for situational use is just genius. I find myself constantly completing a fight and thinking, ""What weapon combinations could I have used to make that fight easier or less stressful?"" Where I once thought we were being restricted, I now realize that this system adds an extra level of depth to character development and even to matching my own play style (right now my favorite combo is 1h sword/oh shield, and 1h mace/oh warhorn). It is the same with slot skills. I constantly find myself messing with skill combinations to find what works best. Am I solo? Am I with other people? Do I need survival

* The combat. At first it was a bit simplistic. I could sit there and just beat on a mob and eventually it would die before it killed me. As I am progressing more into the higher level areas I am finding that I am required to be more tactical in my thinking. My weapons choices matter. My performance in the fight matters. When I dodge and when I activate abilities matters. There are no rotations

* The environments. Just... wow. Everywhere I go I find something new and fun to explore. Where does this cave end? What's behind that mountain? What's on top of that mountain? I can't help myself but go look, even if it's just a chest with some crappy Fine item that I can't even use. The stellar graphics just make it that much better, I was a bit surprised to see that the game is DX9 considering it looks just as good as some of the DX11 games out there. Though, I wouldn't mind if ANet got to work on a DX11 client (wink wink, nudge nudge).

* The ""questing"" system and story. I may ruin the circlejerk here,"" just cleverly masked as not being fetching 20 boar butts. The point is, even if that is all the Renown Heart requires, the game gives you a multitude of other things to do while you are fetching those 20 boar butts. Boss events, invasion events, NPC dialog, and eventually those 4-5 event strings that all tie together in later zones. I love that there's no quests to be tracked, and that there are several different ways to complete an event. The bottom line is that by pushing exploration the vast majority of these events and Renown Hearts are things that I would have been doing anyway, Rift, highly developed lore. This is the first MMO since WoW that I have been interested in the backstory (and WoW was mostly because I came to it as a WarCraft 3 player). I actually care why the Dredge hate the Priory

* Lastly, the down-leveling system. I take back every negative thing I said about it, it is a wholly welcome design change. Yesterday I found myself behind in my crafting, yet woefully short of Copper and Green Wood Logs. Well, the Trading Post is down, what am I to do? Hey, I hadn't ever checked out the Charr starting era, fuck it I'm going to go farm there. An hour later I found myself striving toward 100% map completion of the Plains of Ashford, while still having a bit of an advantage over the lowbies because of my Trait and Slot Skill point allocations. I was humbled by that experience and that is the point that I was convinced that ANet knows exactly what they are doing.

I am absolutely flabbergasted by the game. At every turn something else amazes me, which is what I wanted considering I'm about to start a graduate program for a masters degree and won't have much time to devote to an MMO. But, there is a level of depth to it that is not immediately obvious, all wrapped up in an exquisitely presented package. If anyone reading this is a former WoW raider/player and is on the fence about the game, just get it. You won't be disappointed.

1347845429.0,10009b,Bleeding and You: A Guide and a Warning,Rangsk,595,136,341,"As a level 80 Elementalist who is using a Bleeding-heavy Scepter/Dagger Earth build, as well as to provide suggestions for how Bleeding can be made more viable as a primary damage source.

**Tl;dr**: Bleeding is very good when solo or with others who do not cause any Bleeding, especially in dungeons and group events. The larger the group, the more useless Bleeding becomes.

**What is a ""Bleeding"" and how much damage does it do?**

Unlike many other MMOs such as WoW, especially when comparing cross-class. The condition this post is focused on is ""Bleeding.""

Bleeding can apply to any enemy, however, is that inanimate objects such as a supply cart or a turret cannot have any conditions, including the damage-oriented conditions such as Bleeding, Burning, and Poison.

According to the [Bleeding](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bleeding) article on the GW2 wiki and verified by my own tests

    2.5 + (0.5 * Level) + (0.05 * Condition Damage)

For level 80s

    42.5 + .05 * Condition Damage

This value will give you the damage per second of each Bleeding stack. A level 80 who is going for maximum Condition Damage can easily achieve a total of 1500 Condition Damage. This means each Bleeding stack is dealing 117.5 damage per second per stack of Bleeding they apply.

**Buffing Bleeding Damage**

The Might boon will provide a damage bonus to any existing Bleeding stacks on the target which were caused by the character gaining Might for the duration of the boon. The Vulnerability condition will cause the target to take additional damage from all Bleeding stacks on the target for the duration of the Vulnerability. These are worth mentioning, and so you would want to using Might or apply Vulnerability before applying a long DoT. This is not as important in GW2, unless there are times where more DoTs are applied than others.

All of the generic bonus damage Traits which I have tested, according to my own testing. It's unclear whether this is a bug or a design decision. Given that the Grandmaster Earth Minor Trait does not boost the primary source of Earth damage, and other Boons/Conditions can do so on a per-person basis, it seems more like a bug than a specific design decision.

**Intensity Stacking**

Unlike Burning and Poison, rather than duration. This means that if a 1 second Bleeding is applied at 50 dps, and a 10 second Bleeding is applied at 100 dps, then the target will take 150 dps of damage for the first second, and 100 dps of damage for the next 9 seconds. With my current Scepter/Dagger Earth Elementalist build, I can apply up to about 20 stacks of Bleeding on my own. I have seen Mesmer builds using duelists which can get 25 stacks simultaneously.

Stacking is where the true power of Bleeding builds shine through. With 20 stacks of bleed constantly on the target and 1500 condition damage, Vulnerability, and direct damage applied.

**25 Stack Limitation**

An extremely important and quite possibly fatal piece of information, but per-target. According to my own experiences and tests, this limitation is imposed in the simplest manner possible: when trying to apply a new stack of Bleeding, if there are already 25 stacks of Bleeding applied, then the new stack is not applied.

The consequences of this simple algorithm are quite severe. Many people will apply Bleeding by happenstance, and decide they might as well use [Churning Earth](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Churning_Earth), or a Mesmer puts 15 points into Duelist and gains [Sharper Images](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Sharper_Images). They don't stack Condition Damage, and so their Bleeding, lasting anywhere from 5 seconds to 8 seconds, is applying less than half the dps of someone who is specialized into Bleeding.

This means that even just 2 people using a Bleeding heavy build will be harming each other's dps by working together. Compound this 25-50 times during a battle against Champions with large health pools, rather than Condition Damage, or risk getting Bronze in an event, or wiping in your dungeon due to too low dps.

**Suggestions for Improvement**

*Improve the stack limitation value and behavior.*

1. Significantly expand or eliminate the stack limitation entirely for enemies with large health pools. This will allow Bleeding builds to be effective during those battles

2. Change the algorithm for how the stack limit is enforced to be more optimal for DPS. I suggest the following:

    When another stack of Bleeding is applied to a target

    A. Calculate the damage remaining on all existing stacks of Bleeding and store which one is lowest

    B. Calculate the total damage of the Bleeding to be applied

    C. If the new applied Bleeding will do more total damage than the stored lowest value

    This new algorithm will preserve the highest total damage by Bleeding done to a target given the limitation on how many stacks of Bleeding can exist on a target. This algorithm would at least lessen the cases where incidental Bleeding stacks are harming a Bleeding heavy build

*Make the damage conditions Bleeding

Very often, as those targets do not gain any Conditions. If an Earth Elemental can be harmed by Bleeding, Burning, and Poison, I see no reason a supply cart or turret can't be.

*Make all generic damage boosting Traits affect Conditions applied.*

It is just strange that there are so many ways to gain extra damage through Traits

**Conclusion**

Building around the Condition Damage stat and the Bleeding Condition can be very fun and effective when solo. Additionally, to the point of trying it for a while, having fun in many situations, but ultimately switching away from it due to the seemingly arbitrary limitations imposed. Improving or removing these limitations will inspire more variety among builds, and more fun had all around.

* 1/3 of all Rangers are Sylvari
* 1/3 of Engineers are Asura
* Charr and Norn are rarely casters. They are also rarely thieves (due to size

I find it absolutely fascinating that so many people associated certain races with certain professions. Norn and Charr are the de facto ""knight"" class (due to their size?), but human seems to be the default class for non-warrior/guardians.

Like most PvP scenarios in MMO games, and overall Control Point ownership increases the points your world gain, which has a number of outside of WvW bonuses.

**The Maps**:
There are four WvW zones: Three Borderlands (http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Borderlands), and each Borderland contains an Orb of Power. The basic goal for each Borderland is to control the Orb. 

**Controlling the Orbs**:
When the match resets, but they are very easily overcome by even a small force. Once the Keeper of the Orb is defeated, the opposing worlds can take the Orb and attempt to move it to a Keep or Garrison under their control, transferring the Orb HP &amp; stat bonuses to their players. Orbs can only be stored in four locations: The initial Cradle of Power, the Home World’s Garrison and either of the Keeps on the east and west side of the map (Located as so: http://i.imgur.com/JkfYS.jpg). While the Orb is unseated, you should see the location of the Orb in real time, on both your minimap and the full screen world map. (This seems to be buggy and/or exploitable leading to the map not displaying it’s location, and the Orb can never be moved by the team that controls it. If you want to move the Orb

At the start of the game, your goal should be to do the same, take a location that you can store the Orb and then obtain the Orb. With control over multiple Orbs, you offer your world the greatest bonus you can towards your world winning your match up.

**Eternal Battlegrounds**:
While the EB doesn’t offer anything that affects the overall WvW power of your realm, which offers your realm a greater points bonus than a smaller Keep, or Tower, but controlling the Castle is easier said than done.

**Upgrades &amp; Siege Machinery**:
With the switch from 24 hour resets to week long match ups, more willing to set down more defensive siege machines and, in general, play more defensively. At this point, ignoring defense can lead to your world unable to leave the spawn point, as your opposition chose to defend and upgrade while your world got left in the dust, unable to attack even the lowliest Supply Camp.

Each WvW zone has vendors who will sell you plans for a seige machine for silver

**Communication and Awareness**:
From what I have seen, alliance, or a player willing to take the reins and do enough directing to get things done. Think about what’s important to your world, think about what you would do to take, or defend that objective and prepare to counter it. And double check if that Commander icon you’re following knows what they’re doing (I’ve seen a very, very low level Commander running around; don’t assume that they spent 100g on the book because they’re good and know what they’re doing).

I believe those to be the key points to WvW that aren’t obvious. I didn’t delve into much strategy

The biggest growing pain we’re likely to see this week will be the slow realization that ZergvZergvZerg isn’t going to be the winning formula

And, or doing otherwise game breaking exploits, do your best to have fraps at the ready, or take screenshots of them doing it. Please email your information to exploits at arena dot net to help them identify and close the loopholes a small few players are taking advantage of.

If anyone has any contributions

1. More emotes for role playing. There are many missing key elements missing for basic emotes / animations that we all would love to have.

2. More GUI toggle options. Having the ability to turn off hp bars / name text for all pets / minions. Having the ability to turn on/off player names and pets names for pvp/wvw mode only. Ability to view players armor / weapons (everyone being level 80 and all items yielding cosmetic differences at this point... it should not really matter should it?)

3. Small consumables bar

4. Black Lion Trading - Ability to sort by profession or ability to use item.

5. Internal Dragon Timer NPCs - It would be nice to have an NPC near the dragon spawn areas that can ""sense"" a dragon coming. They will be able to tell any player that asks, ""far off"" 60+ minutes.  This would help many players always asking about dragon time... and help everyone when a server or patch reset happens.  At this time there are external dragon timers and dragons are no real secret once you experience them once. Having the ability to do this in game would be simple to help players out because you know...many people love to continually dragon hunt.

6. Puzzling NPC - Personally

One in each racial city that points to the closest / zones easiest Jumping Puzzle location (just a simple hint of what to look for

The NPC would explain in a wild manner ""Hey, ankle biting, and acrobatics that are required for most of them. Almost every area has a secret or two hidden away... Are you brave enough to seek them out?""   

This way new players will know about them earlier in game and also be inspired to be more adventurous and risk taking on their journey.

7. LFG Option - It easily could be done since in LA the LFG party grouping appears to already be server to server.  Let's just break out a special menu for this

8. BLT Preview - Ability to preview items in the BLT (Added from below ;))

9. First Person View - Self Explanatory (Added from below ;))

10. Guild Features - Guild Halls and more guild features etc. (Added from below ;))

11. Change to all Dragons - Seeing as the 3 current dragons are pretty much fix scripted... Can there
ever be more depth added to them?  Would the engine allow for Shatter to land in different spots? Could
the dragons be given a 360 tail whip attack and also be unlocked to allow them full 360 attack radius? I realize the dynamics of the scripted events and precursor of the turrets
instead they were all spread out in a ring instead of a small square?   Imagine a rework to all 3 dragons
and if they could move and attack 360 degrees, and had the possibility to spawn in different locations across the map. Scripted events are nice but after so many times, predictability becomes boring (and no real challenge). The scripting engine is there... the possibilities are there...  Just think embellishing on this for the future and how
the game could drastically change in challenge. You could easily keep the same artwork

12. More music ability - More musical instruments

13. Champions Loot - Have them always drop loot or a chest. Too many champions drop nothing or white junk. Offer up the same blue loot bag that people get in dungeons... a small karma vial and a bag of coins....  or something... Just something worthy of spending up to 30 minutes killing a Champion. Killed over 100+ champions and received nothing at all....gives you the feeling of why even do it in the first place?

14. Hot swap ""Stances"" - A way you can have 2-3 set configurations of your skills

Ok I am done

Long live Guildwars 2... Love it!

First off,700** survey responses. That's a LOT of data. 


One of the problems we ran into is that with this much data, we want to use a more professional platform, which will help code and manage our data a bit better.


I've put together some high level results and charts that can be viewed in the gallery below. The title of the chart is at the top


Here's some highlights!

* Vast majority of respondents are male (over 90%)
* The average age overall - 24 
* Average age among females - 27.5 
* Average age among males - 23.6
* Elementalist continues to be the most popular class in BWE2. About twice as many play Elementalist as played Engineer
* Females are significantly more likely to play Necromancer and Mesmer. Males more likely to play Warrior.
* For release
* Unsurprisingly
* The Reddit community seems willing to wait for some more polish. One half indicate that the BWE2 candidate is somewhat viable for release. One quarter in total feel it's currently not viable
* ""Thief"" is spelled wrong in one chart. Those who remember the survey will know why.

I may spend some more time looking at the other questions,800 records and some really big questions (i.e. which MMO's have you ever played) it would take days to clean up the data file.

When reading it, they don't DODGE, a main part of the combat system? What do these players do just stand in the AOE and expect to live through it, or don't bother watching the attack animations to know when to avoid an attack?

Don't get me wrong Combo Killer was bugged agreed and getting a group of people together to actually try and pull off combo finishers successfully took coordination

The core issue is here those 'vocal players' are complaining about basic features of the game, I'd understand if the player was so used it in being a 'side feature' of other MMOs but GW2 slaps you in the face with it when it drops an item saying 'OI see this item craft with it!'..

For the record, the highest is 52.

So I'm on a level 22 alt exploring Dissea Plateau.  I ""discover"" the fire temple, but I manage to capture it with 20 seconds left.  Then, BAM, a portal opens.  COOL!

I go to the portal, I manage to take a few out, do a puzzle to get some kind of sword, and then run around aimlessly.  A few minutes later, a level 80 character (who was put down to level 26) hops in, and I introduce myself as having no idea what I was doing, but that I had a sword!

She also had never been inside the fire temple.  I got excited.  Normally in MMOs, it was two people trying to figure it out together.

Eventually, and me finally figuring out what to do the sword, we got to what was presumably the end of the temple... where there was a Champion that the two of us just couldn't defeat.

While we left defeated unable to completely complete the temple

Now I'm sure everyone here has gone through this and think I'm lame for having so much fun with it... but it's so rare in MMOs where you're actually able to figure out something for yourself

For the record, heh!)

during my time in the beta

You don't have to ""go"" to the mailbox.

You don't have to ""go"" to the trading post

You can dye armor anywhere you want

Level scaling means everyone can have fun and be challenged by the content. No more ""run throughs"" of dungeons

All races can be all classes

Classes are not forced to use a small variety of weapons. Seeing a ranger with a greatsword or an elementalist in melee with daggers made my night.  There are some limits

Weapon swapping more or less on the fly.

You can transmute armor so you can look the way you want.

Everyone can gather. And everyone can even gather from the same node!


If you drop a crafting skill

You are not competing for mobs and xp. you still get the same amount of xp regardless if someone swoops in and starts wailing on ""your"" mob. Additionally

Your bags are ""smart"" and they can sort things for you.

Account wide bank slots. No more mailing crap to alts!

Fast travel between wherever you are and a waypoint

skill points make me feel like I am exploring and I earned my skill point. I didn't level up and magically have a point to spend

No quest log. I don't know about you guys, I got it and it was amazing.

Casting while moving adds fluidity

There are no ridiculous looking mounts to grind for.

I don't have to grind for karma. I felt like I always had enough to get the items I wanted.

The attention to detail in the artwork is great.  There are so many little things to notice, to small bits of movement, to lighting, to the epic scale of some locations.  It makes going places fun!

I think GW2 was the first time in an MMO I wasn't thinking ""now what am I supposed to do?"" and instead I was thinking ""now, but overall, I felt much more in control of my time than I am used to.

I suppose a little context would be helpful… but before I do that

I was trying to make this a self-post

So back to the backstory...

My daughter asked me to get this game to play with her.  She's had it since it came out and none of her friends are into it, but it puts me in an interesting position.  She doesn't know about the things I am now seeing, because she simply isn't there yet.

I'm running around to all the different areas; finding the little empty hearts, but I'm not counting on it.  That seems to be one of the goals, so I'll keep trying.

So here are some issues that have come up on the way to going all over…

I keep seeing these little star things that say a guild officer has to do something magical to let me in.  So I figure I'll make a guild and then I can do those things.  So I make a guild

So any help there would be great.

Then there are these dungeons I keep getting messages I can now go to.  But every time I make my way over to one, nonsense, I'll just go take a peek.  That lasted all of thirty seconds before Satan, or something that looked like him and twenty of his friends did something where I couldn't walk or run and stood there helpless while they lit me on fire.  

So how do I do the dungeon thing?  At this point there are 4-6 I have never been in.

My first thought was, so I'll just wait for some people to show up.""  And they did.  And they typed a bunch of stuff I didn't understand ""prty up, lomfn4"" or at least I think that's right, and then they just disappeared.  So that doesn't seem to work.  Not sure how to go in there and try one of them out?

Then people keep talking about jp?  I was in the service and we used a LOT of acronyms

Is there a list somewhere of acronyms used in this game?

Then I hit the b button on accident once and I found this menu to go to a world thing.  So I use that to get back to Lions Arch without spending money on the little teleports.  But I'm pretty sure there is a lot more I should be doing in there besides trying to save cash traveling.  

Any feedback on that whole part of the game would be great.

As many posts here on reddit and on the gw2 forums say

They should implement something equivalent to the Zaishen quests from GW1. For those who didnt play GW1

Imho, because at the moment, we just forget them once we go past our personal storyline. ( ""Hi, I am a Warmaster of the Vigil. Wait, can you tell me what the Vigil is, again?"" ).

As an example:

Every day you can get a mission/quest from your order, and leave the rest of the world in its ""dead state"".
For instance:

Order of Whispers will ask you to go and infiltrate some Fire Legion camp and get a certain amount of documents by talking to some Flame Legion charr or by killing them in X zone

The Vigil will ask you to do a bunch of completely other stuff and in other zones than the Order of Whispers.

Same thing for the Priory.

It would basicly be a kind of daily ""heart"" quests

This would get at least 2 problems solved ( more or less ):
 - Players will have an incentive to return to low level zones in order to do these daily quests ( and since I posted there would be at least 2 different zones for each order to visit ( or why not more ) it would make at least 6 different zones to be crowded daily which would make it more fun both for new players and veterans who are all tired of doing Fractals or stick to Orr events over and over again.

 -As I said, don't get me wrong, I don't want them to drop exotics every time you open one, but will still have a rather good chance to drop them. Cuz honestly, prices for exotics and especially precursors are just insane at the moment. Dusk at around 450 gp, count also the lodestones who are at around 2 gp each. So, without counting the prices for globs of ectoplasm + the 250 of each t6 mat, and thats around 800 gp for your legendary greatsword. Thats just insane. Most people want to be able to play the GAME to get their legendary

So those are my thoughs that could ( in my opinion ) improve the game experience for all GW2 players and make the game a lot more fun.

Let's hear your thoughts about how to make GW2 a better game :-)

**EDIT**: I'd like to clarify a few things. 1. I am not a ""fanboy, according to all these assertions that this ""launch"" (which, by the way, it is not launch) is a failure, then *every* highly anticipated MMO launch in the past has been a failure. The user experience does vary, and for me I've had a good time so far.

This is done in a point format for ease of reading. I also wrote a wall of text if you like to read that instead: http://dulfy.net/2013/06/24/gw2-sky-pirates-of-tyria-patch-preview

**Achievements**

* Around 20 achievements, others are more skill based

* Kill based achievements require you to interact with the same hologram projectors you encountered in Dragon Bash. They now have a 50/50 chance to spawn Aetherblade pirates when you walk near them (some of them will still spawn holographic minions). You can also get these achievements by killing the pirates guarding the various caches if you don't feel like running around.

* Cache based achievements are basically a bunch of existing jumping puzzles/mini dungeons with a new cache (jumping puzzle chest) placed into them. They don't give any special loot but getting them give you an achievement. It is a way to recycle content basically. You will need to do Goemm's Lab, Fawcett's Bounty, Hidden Garden etc to name a few. Some caches are located near entrance but others are located at the very end. 

* Dungeon achievements - some are the standard killing bosses achievements while others are more skill based (i.e. avoid a boss mechanic or kill the boss within a time limit). 

* Completing 12 of the achievements will reward you with a mini pet modeled after a boss in the new dungeon: http://imgur.com/a/7yOu2

* You can find a more detailed guide on Sky Pirate achievements for use tomorrow here: http://dulfy.net/2013/06/23/gw2-sky-pirates-achievement-guide

**Dungeon - Aetherblade Retreat**

* Like molten facility
* Temporary dungeon
* You get a guaranteed rare from the boss chest and 1 gold every time you complete it. The dungeon is hard enough that Arenanet feels it is justified to give 1 gold for every completed run. 
* 5 player dungeon
* Boss chest has a chance to give you an exotic
* You may also find the recipe for an infinite tonic that will transform you into one of the bosses - you can jump with it and the tonic is tradeable once crafted: http://i.imgur.com/rYDUxRd.jpg

* More detailed writeup on dungeon mechanics: http://dulfy.net/2013/06/23/gw2-aetherblade-retreat-dungeon-guide

**Aetherblade Armor (gemstore)**

* I think alot of you have already seen this from datamining. You get 3 sets

* Unfortunately both Charr and Asura uses the male model for both sexes. 

* A gallery of the gemstore armor with different dye/race combos: http://dulfy.net/2013/06/23/gw2-aetherblade-armor
* Here is a preview of some of the armors you can expect in case you can't access the link above: http://imgur.com/a/QKgRM

**Scavenger Hunt**

* Ingame scavenger hunt to promote the launch of Sea of Sorrows book

* Need to find 12 Marriner plaques. You can find all 12 of them using clues given inside the book (or just look for them blindly like I did) . You get an achievement and one time use consumable that give you 5 skill points. 

* If you are not a fan of doing scavenger hunts on your own

**Jumping Puzzle**

* Not released until second week on July 2.

* Can't talk about it now but I will say I had a rough time doing it so it should be fun :D

I think that is it

Tyria has far, far, far, far too much gold.  

Our story begins [a little over 250 years ago](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Guild_Wars).  Adventurers roam the land, if not hundreds of gold pieces.  Random people give hundreds of gold pieces for simple errands.  Secretive wizards conjure millions of gold pieces from thin air through short-lived accidents of physics.  

As inflation spirals out of control Grenth and Balthazar begin to dispense [Ectoplasm](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Glob_of_ectoplasm) and [Obsidian Shards](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Obsidian_shard) to those they deem worthy.  Over time these entirely replace gold as the primary form of currency.  At this point

The [White Mantle](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/White_mantle) regime is thrown into chaos by the destabilization of its money supply.  Without [access](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Temple_of_ages) to the [Underworld](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Underworld) or the [Fissure,](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Shining_Blade) and [Queen Salma](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Queen_Salma) resumes her family's dictatorial reign over Kryta.

The budding government, faces a national crisis: [What do you do when buying a loaf of bread requires several pounds of gold?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper-inflation)

With gold basically falling from the sky

[Gold coins](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Coin) that we know today are materially worthless.  As many people have pointed out, as we know, is so common that it is worthless.

What does this mean for us?

* [Bags of Coins](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bag_of_Coins) are in fact bags of gold (as they used to be named).  The value of a large bag full of non-Krytan gold coinage is roughly 4 Krytan silver pieces.  

* Personal fortunes no longer require a [worldwide network of magical storage agents.](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Xunlai_Guild)  Banks therefore can save a lot of space

* The value relationship of ancient gold coinage to modern Krytan currency can be computed using a variety of methods

* [Potatoes](http://www.gw2spidy.com/item/12135) cost as much as [gold ore](http://www.gw2spidy.com/item/19698) because gold ore is nearly valueless due to its abundance and ease of harvest.

* The currency supply is strictly controlled by the Krytan monarchy, the Pale Tree and the Charr Legions.  This ensures that the civilizations of Tyria are not destabilized again by massive inflation.

1346223449.0,z0byt,This has been the most enjoyable mmo I have played in years...,ctess,565,148,335,"**Rant**

I've been in several mmo beta's and played several mmo's including wow, SWTOR, and now Guild Wars 2. Not only is this the most enjoyable game I have played in a long time I can't seem to stop playing it and I even got my girlfriend into it who does not play mmo's or any games really. I've waited for a few years since the announcement of GW2 since PAX (Even have the t-shirt from the event still) and I can proudly say that ArenaNet has not let me or anyone in the community down. In my own opinion, this was the smoothest release as well as the best release of the year, regardless of what any sales reports will tell you.

**Reasons I think GW2 is the best game of the year**

* The game itself is beautiful and runs extremely well on my POS computer. I know not everyone's computer can handle it and there are quite of few crashes but it is rare that my game can handle most modern games and they did such a good job that the scenery is still beautiful and captivating.
* The unique storylines and options will make replaying much less monotonous. Although
* I haven't reached that boring stage. I'm not like a lot of hard core gamers out there that will sit down and play for hours on end trying to level up to the max level or rush to get through the game but this game has me constantly wanting to play at all hours of the day. Seriously
* Downtime? I generally expect some downtime with the first weeks of game play to smooth out issues that didn't get covered in the beta. What did those genuis' do at ArenaNet? Rolling frigin restarts/patches/builds. Minimal downtime for game play. The longest down time I think I saw was when the login servers crashed the opening night but I was headed to bed anyways (and maybe the 20-60 minute downtime tonight for some servers).
* One thing, hell the thread about name banning and general rude behavior was down right hilarious and also inspiring. They are creating a community filled with no gold spammers (I'm sure there might be some eventually), mature minded people who can show their respect for one another and ensure that frustrations are not voiced in an inappropriate way (for the most part).
* The game play is unique. Each individual race and profession has it's purpose and role but at the same time can still function in a group to work as a team. There are no ""set"" we need a tank

**Dear ArenaNet/NCSoft**

Thank you for doing an awesome job

**TL;DR** Guild Wars 2 is the best mmo I have ever played

**EDIT** Yes there are problems with certain features of the game such as the trading post and mail not working. ANet released a statement about disabling the mail because of an exploit which they are working on fixing. Some of these things are not an easy fix (you would know if you had any type of software engineering background!) and there is a lot of testing on their own end to ensure that these fixes are working correctly and not breaking other systems.

1354465221.0,145k35,How do you guys feel with Guild Wars 2 being one of /r/games most regretful buys of 2012?,wingmasterjon,730,306,850,"**Disclaimer: I don't want this to be a bashing post. The game is worth every penny I paid for it just for WvW alone

I was reading through [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/145b1g/what_games_have_you_regretted_buying_the_most/) about what game people regretted buying most this year, I really do like GW2, but my criticisms for the game are consistent with why people stopped playing it. For starters, it was way different from GW1 (which is good, otherwise it should have just been an expansion). But on the other hand, it dumbed down character building to sealed-deck type builds. When GW1 was on its last legs, ANet introduced a lot of strange gameplay modes like Codex and a new quest structure system in EoTN that I wasn't too fond of. They pretty much used that to beta test GW2. I adopted

The release wasn't as smooth as it should have been. Plagued with bugs and instability. Auction services weren't working, the game did lack a good feel for immersion that really made you want to keep doing the next step. You couldn't get lost in the story because you'd have to continuously go out and level to meet the next recommended level bracket in order to not get stomped in personal story instances. While the holy trinity removal made grouping easier, it kind of made team dynamics weaker. The combo field system isn't as brilliant as I thought it'd be. It's rarely utilized enough to make it important. There are still defense, offense and support roles, but they aren't as dependent as classic Guild Wars 1 team building.

Now, and most of us spent thousands of hours doing just PvP and some PvE on the side. I whole hardheartedly think PvE gameplay is better in GW2, but the story is weaker. The PvP definitely isn't the same, and I tried to ease them into it during the beta by explaining my experiences so they didn't have unrealistic expectations at launch.

GW1 had its launch issues as well. The group of friends I played with loved it during pre-searing and almost all quit after they made it to Ascalon (post-searing) and saw how dry the environment got after seeing the beautiful pre-searing maps. It wasn't a huge deal overall since the game got prettier, you're not going to keep everyone interested.

I really am curious to see if and how GW2 will change over the next couple years. I know GW1 became a better game for the changes before EoTN

**The skill system**  
Since the last few levels, it makes me feel like I already know the ins and outs of my class, and there are no game changing skills to look forward to. There are a lot of utility skills to choose from, but most of them revolve around removing boons, inflicting conditions, swapping boons&lt;-&gt;conditions which feels unnecessary, since all of my weapons skills apply a ton of conditions already, but it's rare to have conditions on me

**The combat**  
I feel that the dodge/evade mechanic is overhyped. All of the fights are 23402341 to me. If I'm soloing, and even if I just burn the mob down without dodging, I will regenerate back in 5 seconds after the fight, which makes dodging feel unnecessary. If it's a group battle, I cannot dodge, because the screen is filled with so many effects/projectiles/aoe on the ground that I can't even see the mob. I just run around the mob, trying to keep my distance. This also seems to ruin the combo system, and hope it activates a combo.

**The conditions**  
I don't feel they really add weight. Almost all of my skills inflict some condition on the target. I never consider something like ""Hm, because it either adds so little to the fight, or lasts for such a very short time, that I could use another damaging move, making the mob go down faster. On group fights, the mob will have all of the possible conditions anyway, which just makes my logic more like ""is the skill on cooldown? use it."".

It's a really fantastic game, or how nice of a feature the vistas are, how dynamic events are much more awesome than quest hubs, and many other things. I just want to get your opinions on these three things that I feel lacking.

**1) Be patient with new fans.** From now on, and we want people to feel welcome and engaged.

**2) Get ready for some legitimate criticisms.** With gaming critics finally getting a hand on the ""final"" product, assess if it matters, and act as a good gaming community that aims for positive improvement rather than rabidly defending our beloved game. **If anything, listening to criticism will help us temper our expectations of the game and not be disappointed because we built the game in our minds to something far greater than it could ever achieve.**

Our strategy for the extermination of Newbies is threefold

1. **Offer Helpful Advice** - Subterfuge is often the our greatest weapon. It's your job to infiltrate their ranks and begin reconditioning them as soon as possible.
2. **Be friendly at all times** - I've heard the phrase ""Kill them with Kindness"" before and figured we should try it out. And since we can't directly attack other players
3. **Show them how awesome you are** - Teach them to respect the power of a level 80 character! Fight amongst their ranks

1353284975.0,13f97h,"What WE, the players, learned from this event.",sargonas,563,345, it's clear ArenaNet and GW2 plan to throw some awesome new concepts at us. Previous MMOs would add new content in patches and it would just

Instead, pushing the line of scrimmage back into uncharted territory. We held the enemy at bay while NPCs cleared forests, erected defenses and built out new bases and new waypoints right before our very eyes. This brave new world was not just there ready for us, we had to actively help CREATE it in real time out of an uncharted and untamed wild land. Now that the event is over, the island has ""flipped over"" and is now more like traditional content with new quest and goals ready for adventure like any other.

It's clear that ANet was not quite prepared for what went down this weekend, they will fine tune their efforts and streamline their procedures. We will start getting more content with even more complex and fantastical levels of interactivity not common in most MMOs.. and you know what?

*... we never paid a penny for this new content and experiences.*

Think about that. For a moment don't look at what went wrong, the gamers, and look at what little they asked of us in return other than to try and enjoy it at their expense.

**Edit 1**: This comes up a lot so let me clarify on WHY I say ""it's free content"". Money we spend on things like gems and collectors upgrades and character slots are optional things we choose to buy that we are in NO way obligated to purchase. If we don't, the majority of games published these days have roughly 10-60 hours of playability in them when they ship. We pay $60 for those games... we also paid $60 for this game, and the average person who's been playing since launch has long ago exceeded their 200th hour or more. That means if you have played for more than an average of 1 hour a day since launch (which was ~80 days ago) you have already exceeded this level of content by 25%. Essentially your initial ""investment"" has already paid out and you are now enjoying things for free. Sure it can be argued that the upfront cost was a payment for all content and time, even your 500th hour and on, but that just means that with every hour you play the cost per hour goes down as it is amortized over time untill we start talking about fractions of a cent per hour and that's just plain silly! If you are of an average play style then you have already exhausted the cost to content ratio of a traditional $60 retail game, therefore this weeks content was a bonus to you. You can argue to the opposite all you want but really it's a simple matter of practicality. There are hundreds to thousands of hours of content for only $60 of REQUIRED money to get into this. At some point that money has long paid it's dues and is no longer a factor.",,self,HumanT,

 The issue? Server transfers. A large amount of people are currently transferring their accounts to the enemy server and logging in then queuing up for the server they want to mess with. They then DUMP the supply from the enemy by building arrow carts or ballista in the spawn. What happened today was made totally obvious: they pick up an orb that one server gets

The server who did not spend any resources taking the keep (the third server) took the orb by using someone who transferred servers and were able to capture the orb completely. They ran the orb to their keep. Now, then we'd have instead saw him take the orb and re-place it in the garrison we won or ran it to the bay like everyone on chat (/team and /say) was saying.

This is incredibly upsetting for the servers this is happening to. Obviously this is just one issue of many, then neither of those servers should be made available to transfer from those three servers. Servers not currently against each other are free to transfer to.

*Edit: Patriickk suggests that to allow the transfer but not allow them to enter WvW until matchup is complete. This would be a good idea as well!

You guys downvote topics just because they explain how you currently farm gold and you are afraid A.net nerfes these?

If it was not intended they will fix it and noone has an unfair advantage. If it was intended you can just keep milking that sweet spot you just found.

1330666130.0,qe3pc,A Primer on MMO Inflation ,,489,100,94,"Hey All!

While I am a gamer, even within this subreddit. However, what I do have some knowledge of is commerce, and from that background I can help everyone here begin to conceptualize how GW2's economy might look.

|

**How Real People Inflation Works - Oversimplified**

In a modern economy, the velocity of money (how often it's used), and the real value of a transaction. However, the one thing that needs to be remembered is that **the central bank adjusts the amount of money available in the economy (using bonds and other means) to keep inflation where they want it**. Too much inflation? Take money out of the economy. Too little inflation? Put money back in. It's a LOT more complex than that, but that's all you need to know for here.
 
 |


**The Problem With Video Game Economies**

There are a couple reasons that video game economies are so prone to inflation. This all roots from the fact that the game developers set rules that essentially make the NPCs all function as members of the ""in-game central bank.""

1) **The existence of money (for now on known as ""gold"") is very unpredictable.** The amount of money you earn for a task

2) **Every NPC acts like their own little central bank.** Think about it this way: when you kill a person and steal all their wealth in real life, when you kill a person and steal all their goods, a new person will respawn with a similar amount of wealth. Thus, every NPC is pumping money and value into the economy.

3) This one works the same for in-game and regular economies: **nobody likes it when you take their money for no reason.** If you knew that the central bank, you'd be pissed. You may understand if the government were giving you value in return (like a fee to access a beautiful park or an interest-bearing bond), you may be more understanding. Similarly, arbitrary fees to do necessary tasks in games have the tendency to piss off players. **Thus, a game must do its best to incentivize players to spend their gold without making the items they are spending their gold on necessary to the core game mechanic.**

|

**Methods for resolving these problems**

There are a few different ways to resolve each of these problems

1) **Limiting Transactions.** This is the Commie method of preventing inflation. In this method

2) **Limiting dispersement of Gold.** To avoid inflation, but eventually greats a ""grind"" dynamic, and once your game drops to a point where there is an obligatory grind to fulfill basic needs and desires, you are screwed.

3) **Creating Gold-Sinks** - The most raw definition of a gold-sink is any transaction or event in which a currency exits the economy permanently. This can be through an event

There are good and bad ways to create gold sinks. Gold sinks should either be small, players start feeling like they are being ""taxed away."" If your purchase gold sinks don't adequately incentivize making the purchase, they are useless. **Players want to feel like they are getting something for their hard-earned cash**.

|

**How GW2 handles these concerns.**

Arenanet has created a balanced approach to resolving in-game inflation.

**First, and tokens and limit Karma/Token Transactions.**This method is applied in GW2 using Karma and Tokens. Essentially, tasks you fulfill give you karma (and fulfilling dungeons give you tokens), but you cannot trade Karma with other players or use it in trades. You then trade the Karma or tokens in for items of value to you, but these items have zero value to anybody else. Arenanet then sets your Karma and Tokens on fire, never to be seen again. **Thus, every player who enters and exits the game will not experience inflation with Karma and tokens, though

**Second, is earned most efficiently through events and hearts rather than grinding (in fact, I have personally yet to see a video that proves regular mobs will even drop gold at all). This helps to eliminate the ""grind"" mentality by encouraging players to play the game rather than engage mobs. However, mobs in GW2, whether or not they drop actual gold, do drop items which can be sold, which is effectively the same as getting gold. **To alleviate the gold inflation from item selling, and those parts can then be consumed while crafting. This allows Arenanet to sink gold into craft-leveling without charging oppressive transaction fees. Most of the items that come out at the end of crafting will not be worth the sum of crafting components added to them

**Third, buying transmutation stones, participating in certain minigames, seasonal events, town-clothes, and more. Essentially, instead of buying tactical advantages and numbers, and therefore unintrusive (you won't one day walk up to the auction house and realize you just don't have the cash to list an item for sale or open the map and just realize you really don't have the funds to teleport).

Creating a world economy also helps to balance things. By theories of demand, begin to model the underdeveloped/developing/developed model of international economics (sorry, I'm nerding out a little).

|

**Conclusion**

While it's difficult to say for certain now, by eliminating incentive to grind mobs and making gold-earning tasks time-intensive, by encouraging the destruction of trash loot into crafting rather than vendor sales, by creating manageable transaction fees, by creating incentivized gold-sinks, and by preventing multi-runs on dungeons just for rare drops, GW2 attacks gold inflation from multiple fronts.

**Most importantly, for the most part, fun.** Crafting, mini-games, cosmetic gear, achievement-seeking, DE-encouraging, and Karma-spending are just plain fun. You get rewarded for sending your gold out of the economy,self,

* [Mockup3 (UPDATED!v4) The health-pool suggestion

**Health Numbers Readout (mockup 2.5):** 

* For the example, it's rounded into 2 digits around a decimal point. So 75% of the phantasm's health is 2.2k. 
* I decided NOT to do percentage

**Illusion Order Readout (Mockup 2 &amp; 3):**

* Hopefully this is obvious
* The small numbers BELOW the circles w/the same look as the keybind numbers is an idea i had if people don't like the color flashing to indicate health. This way


**Circles (ALL mockups):** 

* The purple circles stand for phantsams
* The pink for clones
* The circles around each indicator in the first mockup is a mini-health bar. 

**REASONING:** 

* First off, but that can be a hassle while trying not to die/close to dying.

* It's to help gauge shatter timing better. When we get symbols for clones

In other games this is often done with guides, strategies, gameplay videos, and streams. Right now we are in the early days of GW2, but it is apparent to a lot of us who are trying our best to be the best that there is a great possibility for eSports in GW2. Some guides, and videos are out there, the community

If you want eSports to become part of GW2, strategies, and streams we need you to want it. Come watch our streams, support the different teams, spread the word.

Games don't become part of eSports without an audience who wants it to. We need an audience. A lot of us believe that this will happen but raising awareness never hurts. So tune in to streaming sites like Twitch.tv

**Instancing**

This was one of my concerns.  Like many of you

The reality wasn't nearly as bad as I expected, it's zones themselves that get full (at least, I think so).  Thanks to overflow servers, you're never really prevented from going about your business - and if you don't fancy going on to an overflow server for a zone, you can always go and do something else in a less-populated zone.

When ArenaNet announced overflow servers, some kinks to work out (such as being in a party of people and being on different overflow servers).  I don't think that it should be too big of a deal to fix this.  Perhaps they could implement some logic so that parties go to the same overflow server.  It shouldn't imbalance things.

**The Environments**

What can I say?  They're beautiful.  There wasn't one place I went where I didn't think ""This place looks great"".  And there wasn't any wasted space that I could see.  There was always something going on somewhere, but all that did mess up forming groups, and helping friends who were ""phased"" differently.  And even then, the replaced content was still just as static.  A bunch of NPCs sitting around.  There are NPCs ""sitting around"" in GW2 aswell, but I feel there's more conversation going on.  There's more people moving around and between towns.  People coming and asking for help (A precursor to an event).  I have no complaints.

**Combat**

I can only write about the thief class which is the class I wanted to play (coming from a Rogue in WoW), I thoroughly enjoyed dodging, kiting, firing, trying to get the up on my enemy.  I didn't have time to go over all the possible extra traits and skills to refine my Thief (perhaps I should have played in PvP a bit), but there's a plethora of things I still need to unlock and investigate.  I'm going to thoroughly enjoy refining my thief to my play-style.

One issue I had with dodging was double-tapping the key to do it.  I'm not sure if it was my keyboard, no less.  That didn't end well), but I'm sure these are minor kinks that can be worked out.

**Audio**

I have no real complaints here.  The background music is beautiful (no surprise there, it would be that some spells from other classes *appeared* to be brutally loud compared to my own pistol-firing.  But then, I don't suppose magic was ever supposed to be particularly quiet.

**Social**

The other thread on this subject hit the nail on the head.  Whilst I saw very little ""chatting"" going on (with the exception of the end-of-beta event), just contribute.

I've never seen a community in a game work so well cohesively together, but I think in a game with emergent grouping like this, it will be the exception rather than the norm.

One addition I would like is the addition of **/say**, and you can always ignore the person in question.  And the profanity filter is on by default.

**Level Scaling**

One of the things I was most interested in, but not a moronic one who laughs off the blows being landed on his face.  And XP was still rewarded, even though it was a titchy amount.  If your buddies buy the game late and need your help through earlier content, it's not necessarily going to be a ""stand back whilst I hit a button and nuke the zone"" kind of fight.  It'll still be pretty easy, but it'll be fun too.

**Summary**

Just before the end of the beta-weekend

I am completely won-over and impressed by this game.  This is the kind of MMO I would gladly pay $15 a month for, is just an extra boon.

So - if you're on the fence about buying Guild Wars 2, and I'm sure that many classes need tweaking.  We're still at the beta.  But hell, I'd play it in the state it's in now.  Quite happily.

**This is not a new thing.** Not for Guild Wars 2 itself or for gaming videos in general.
I am a YouTube partner

As I mentioned, personal use only”. ArenaNet, or more accurately NCsoft, are not actively chasing after video creators. This flagging system is caused by YouTube itself.

For this reason networks exist
Monetization through this automated system does not make you a partner. YouTube explicitly states the following on game video monetization: “Whether you can use video game content for monetization depends on the commercial use rights granted to you by licenses of video game publishers. Some video game publishers may allow you to use all video game content for commercial use and state that in their license agreements. Videos simply showing game play for extended periods of time may not be accepted for monetization.” 
Yes, but **in general game videos can not simply be monetized by just about anyone on YouTube** and your video will be flagged and possibly pulled. *Keep in mind that you can still make videos as much as you want to if you do not activate monetization and therefor just use this for non-commercial uses.* (There are other exceptions that I won’t go into detail in, and admittedly am not too familiar with) 

Now then, Machinima, TGN.. Etc etc. These are a *different* case altogether and most –if not all – of the content creators you’ll be watching Guild Wars 2 videos from are part of a network such as these. Through these networks you are a partner and the network you are part of takes care of the legalization ends, allowing you to create game content. 

I’ll state it again, but be wary. If you want to actively be making money from gaming content on YouTube – and you think you have the time required to do so – Join a network. 

Does this hurt people? Doubtfully. Again

*You can dislike ArenaNet all you want



TL;DR:
Nothing changed here

1346429561.0,z534v,One of my favorite little things that just makes sense...,EspeonageX,489,112,235,"The level downgrading is definitely one of my favorite features. For one

My favorite thing, thinking about other MMOs, you go back into a low-level zone and are some kind of a god, taking little to no damage from the mobs and one-shotting everything you look at. How does this makes any sense? Somehow because you've leveled up, 5 huge, heavily armored dudes hacking you with swords is nothing? 

GW2 is the first time I've thought about this, it's gonna be easier, you've done harder stuff. And yes, you have a slight advantage because you've found some quality gear that is all-around better at doing its job. So you take a bit less damage and do a bit more. Your character has also done more difficult things, so why should they get more experience than they do. This just helps enhance immersion on a level that I've not previously experienced in an MMO and I LOVE it.

1347050045.0,ziuvm,Conditions are completely useless against large boss fights which severely limits build variety. ,Rhynocerous,496,125,392,"Stacks of conditions on bosses have arbitrary stacks that were obviously meant for balance but they are completely nonsensical in large boss encounters. I'll go down the list. Please correct me if I'm wrong about mechanics here. 

Note that I am not discussing PvP balance here

**Bleed** - Stacks to 25

Elementalists, and Mesmers all have SUBSTANTIAL sources of bleed. Elementalists and Mesmers atleast can apply 25 stacks of bleed *by themselves.* So what happens when you have a mesmer, and ele, and a ranger using bleed? A huge amount of that damage is completely lost on the boss. Add more bleed into the mix and it's even worse. The solution here is to make bleed an individual condition, as my stacks of bleed don't weaken the boss for other people and there are no scaling gains.

**Burning and Poison** - 1 stack to 1 minute

1 stack? Ha. I hope these aren't actually working off only 1 stack. 

**Vulnerability** - Stacks to 25

Same issue as Bleed

**Confusion** - Stacks to 25

A boss having 25 stacks of confusion just means a mesmer dropped an Etherial field. I don't really care about this one because Confusion is overrated in PvE anyway against slow attacking bosses. 

Everything else is mechanically redundant, weakness, crippled, etc.


tl;dr: If you're using conditions for damage against event bosses

Some days ago there was an interview where it was said [""improving the guild system wasn't a priority""](http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/1hrr89/4gamers_interview_with_mike_zadorojny_lead/).

I don't know if this is a new case of developer blindess

But what would be one of my threads without a good amount of ideas:

---

**Making the guild panel a social panel**

Each guild should have a ""blog"" section, etc. Not a real blog, and should have limits (like removing old news posts). It's main purpose would be posting guild news, explanations on how the guild works, etc.

People should be able to find everything about the guild in the guild panel, and I would love to post them at the guild panel.

Also

Some space to store guild recruitment and welcome messages would be nice

---

**Communication from officers to members**

Officers should be able to mass /w or mail all members of a rank. When you want to announce something happening right at the moment

There's no way for officers to communicate with the members properly. The message of the day fails once again

---

**Guild mission activation control**

There should be options to limit guild mission activation for specific ranks. There's always someone that screws up and activates a bounty

Also, and watch him to see if he does it often, or just demote him to a rank without permissions.

---

**WvW and guilds**

Guilds can put their banners on keeps, and that's all. This is just boring, lame even. When a guild raises their banner somewhere, members of that guild should be encouraged and rewarded to defend the place.

The enemy should be encouraged to attack

We could introduce a new mechanic: Morale.

Morale would be server and guild-tied. Server morale would affect everyone, but then you get some extra guild morale just for yourself, because you did the work. Same if you lose, then you get extra penalization.

You'd earn morale first by defending. Each member defending a position with your flag would give morale to the guild. The second way would be taking enemy positions. Every member participating on taking an enemy camp would earn morale

Morale could give basic stat boosts, to then have a morale advantage at a better-defended tower you're able to hold.

It's just an example

---

**Events and guilds**

Events and whatever are nice

And not just vanity stuff, for example. There's so much potential, I'm really surprised and saddened of how guilds do nothing special during events. Think of all the influence sinks, too!

---

**Last logged in**

I won't ask for a ""how much influence every member produces"" option. I don't think that could be positive in any way. However

We should have two types: Last represented, to make sure it wasn't a flash represent that doesn't show any kind of activity.

It's a pain to clean inactives to make space. This is probably the most important point of the list.

---

**Calendar with alerts**

A basic calendar, 30 or 5 minutes before it beings.

It could use the mail system

---

**Guild achievements**

Why do guild missions have ZERO achievements? Giving all guild missions achievements would encourage people to play them more than once per week

There should be a ""Guild"" section in achievements,000 influence achievement, which doesn't encourage socializing in any way).

These achievements could give specific visual rewards, unlocking flag ornaments or siege weapon skins for the guild, and even custom armors (not necessarily new) for guards defending positions you raised your flag at, so the enemy knows there's good players defending the place.

---

**TL;DR:**

* Options to write long and classified pieces of text on your guild panel
* Ability to mass whisper and mail members of the selected ranks.
* Control on who is able to activate and who has activated guild mission objectives.
* Reasons in WvW to defend positions with your flags raised.
* Guild influence stuff during events
* Last logged and last 30min represented options to check activity.
* Calendar with mail alerts minutes before it begins.
* Guild missions and playing with guildmates should have achievements of their own

I posted some mesmer support builds one day and largely they were met with approval but I still got the normal ""Mesmer's should just dps, in PVE so far maybe that does work best. But I just got out of my first level 20 fractal, and the people who think certain classes need to play DPS and if not they are doing it wrong are in for a big surprise.

The farther I get in these fractals the more skilled players I am finally seeing, or even guys built soley for DPS, like some people think thier class is ""meant"" to do, are being left in the dust. I may get some negative feedback for saying this but DPS is arbitrary in these levels of fractals and I'm sure it becomes more so later on, DPS will come from survivablity, you cant DPS if u keep getting downed and people have to res. Even me, a mesmer, gets murdered. I am forced to use purely tank/support clone tank and buff builds to really help my team, theres no timer

I think this is going to bring alot more situational and character build awareness to some people. It'll show them gaurdians and warriors arent the only tanks, and pure dps builds are gonna have a rough time.

edit: the point of this post is to say that in the higher levels you go in fractals, if you were never downed and we never wiped, what did your build really achieve? We beat the boss a minute or two faster? Risky IMO.

1354270541.0,141opp,I would love to see the respawn timers on general mobs be turned up significantly. Am I alone on this?,taboo_,510,154,235,"Hey all

I'm a *total* noob to MMO's GW2 being my first as such I don't know if there's something I'm missing or lack but this really irks me.

I feel like the respawn timer for general mobs is *far* too low. If I am walking through a fairly deadly area taking out mobs one at a time to get to a champ at the end of it there is nothing more infuriating than taking out 10 pretty brutal guys to have them all respawn before your eyes after bugger all time right as you provoke the champ (this still applies if you're in a party).

I've also had situations where I've taken out a mass of enemies around a skill point or objective to die

I see no decent argument in support of it either. Being forced to kill the same enemy over and over doesn't bring enjoyment to the game - and I'm not suggesting to turn re-spawns off all together but why not crank the timer up to 5mins or so. Make it feel like we're actually having some influence in the world

Thoughts?

Since at this point you'll most likely look at 0/0/30/20/20 and go ""hahah, which means if it shows up on your screen as hostile, you'll most likely end up tagging it. While you don't get the satisfaction of bursting down single targets, you **will** get a ridiculous amount of loot from any battle you're involved in.

Now for the hilarious fun parts: Reviving allies. You spot a Downed friend or two in distress, which casts it on your location. 90% of the time, opponent players will now completely forget that you and your friends are even there; what happens now is this: 

* Regeneration kicks in from [Shadow Protector](http://www.guildhead.com/trait/2384/shadow-protector)

* You will start regenerating health from Shadow Protector **and** [Shadow's Rejuvenation](http://www.guildhead.com/trait/751/shadows-rejuvenation)

* The smart enemy players that actually do catch on to your shenanigans are now too busy chasing off your [Merciful Ambush](http://www.guildhead.com/trait/2358/merciful-ambush) thief

* If for some reason your friends are Dead and not just Downed (you slowpoke), you can use it to scrape a dead friend off the ground with a single Refuge and still be home in time for dinner (note that +Healing doesn't affect the revival speed from Death, only from Downed).

* When you're done reviving your friends

Since both Shadowstep and Shadow Refuge are Deception skills, switch out Bountiful Theft for [Trickster](http://www.guildhead.com/trait/2200/trickster) to shave off that CD as well.

Even though this is an entirely teamwork-focused build, Shadowstep and Hide In Shadows along with Vit / Toughness gear (I like the Invader's set you can get for Karma) should let you escape from absolutely anything, then swing back around and continue being a nuisance. The focus on survival stats is what lets you stand in arrow cart / siege fire while using one arm to peel your buddies off the ground and the other to pick up all those loot bags from poisoned / bleeding foes.

Everywhere I look I see level 80's using the same crappy 5 signet build

What I'm about to write is a radical shift from how you 100 blade spamming warriors play the class

**1) TRAITS**

The trait allocation is as follows:

* 10 Strength 

* 30 Defense

* 30 Tactics


Now you may say: 
""Oh how will I ever do damage"" 
or
""Pve will take to long""

But a Superior rune of bloodlust will make it seem like your damage hasn't changed


**2) MAJOR TRAIT SLOTS**

For Strength: Taking ""Berserkers Power"" for Pve and ""Death From above"" for wvw are your two go to traits. Death from above is invaluable when people are seigeing your gates. Simply jump down and voila

For Defense: 
* Adept - Missile deflection/Turtle's Defense. (I prefer Missile deflection in pvp)
                  
* Master - Shield Master
                  
* Grandmaster - Spiked Armor/Defy Pain (I prefer spiked armor)

For Tactics: 
* Adept - Leg specialist
                 
* Master - Lung capacity
                 
* Grandmaster - Vigorous shouts. 


**3) SKILLS**

I use a Sword mainhand

HEALING

* Mending

UTILITY SKILLS: 

* For great justice
               
* Shake it off
                
* On my mark for PvE 
                
* And Fear me for PVP


ELITE

* Signet of rage.


**4) ARMOR/ITEMS**

I currently use the Knight's Draconic set
(Toughness vitality
My Accesories are a mix of knight's and carrion.
My sword has a superior rune of bloodlust and my shield has a superior rune of fire (30% chance of aoe on crit)

My stats are: 

* 2080 Power

* 1350 Precision

* 2039 Toughness

* 1678 Vitality

And

* Attack: 3034

* Critical Chance: 25% (45% with fury)

* Armor: 3311

* Health: 25992


**5) PLAYSTYLE**

* PVE: Your Shouts will do ~ 1500 healing each at level 80 to everyone who is in range of you. This means that every 20 seconds you have to capacity to heal your party for 4500 health. You will be doing this OFTEN. Your F1 and your  Cripple skill both immobilize, poison, bleeding or cripple/chill.



* WvW: You will not die. Ever. I can run from tower to tower with ~7 80's whaling on me. You will be rezzing people (you res faster from tactics, heal up and repeat. 

**Something to note**

Because of your traits


**Thanks for reading.**
 Hopefully you will take some of this to heart and try it out. If even 1 person sees this and becomes a better player because of it. I'm happy.

1367818614.0,1ds00i,The Moderately Awesome Guide to Making Money in GW2,geekmonger,459,111,86,"**Allow me to introduce myself**

A couple months ago, I enjoy playing with MMO economies, and it's something I've done before. So I started looking for quick ways to make a buck.

This guide summarizes some methods I've found. 

* Each technique can be done in a few minutes
* These are ""standing still"" techniques. You don't have to leave town. You don't have to kill things
* Most of these techniques don't require a lot of seed money to get started. However

I won't be covering any grinding

**A note for those who disdain ""playing the economy""**

There is an interesting group of people who find it offensive that lots of money can be made through arbitrage and ""market manipulation"" and all manner of virtual-banker techniques

I do understand how it can feel unfair that performing the core activities of the game leaves you dirt-poor. But consider this - I only dedicate 5-10% of my playing time to money making. When I'm using the techniques in this guide, in the remaining 90% of my time, I do whatever I feel like. I enjoy it, and I never ever worry about how much gold I'm making per hour. My 90% play time feels much more liberated because I don't have to worry about gold. And really, that 10% time where I'm just making gold - that can be pretty fun too, in its own way.

**Resources**

These are the resources I use on a regular basis. I'll explain them in more detail in subsequent posts.

1360595270.0,18b78x,Colorblind Mode?,,439,86,123,"There have been many of us waiting for a colorblind mode to be introduced into Guild Wars 2 for months now and yet we have not heard back anything. I have posted countless times on the forums and have yet to get a response from anet.

I understand that we are a small percent of players and most of you probably wont care or even know that this is a major issue when attempting to play the game. For the first few months I actually had no idea that there were circle indicators on the ground for good and even bad spells. During this time when running a dungeon if I died to spikes in AC people would just laugh at me. ITS A DISABILITY

Even now that I know there are circles on the ground I still can't do a thing about it. After the spider boss in AC I will sit at the base of the ramp and when people ask me why and I tell them to please just hit the chain so i can walk up without dying sometimes I get a response of ""no

Thank you for taking the time to read this.

Edit: Hey guys

As for some people asking what they should do

As for people suggesting to mess around with my monitors hue

If anyone would have any suggestions on how to actually make anet aware of this besides posting on the fourms as that sadly doesn't work

**WvW matchmaking in BWE2 was broken.**
####################

ArenaNet is specifically unhappy with how it turned out:

&gt; I’m really sorry folks
- [Mike Ferguson](https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/pvp/wuvwuv/Servers-do-not-rematch/page/1#post206657)


Glicko is their current ranking tool. Read more about it [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glicko_rating_system).

In BWE2, after which there's nothing to do. Being a tiny server sucks even more: you can achieve essentially nothing against a force forty times your size. *People on both sides just stop playing WvW.*

&gt; WvW matches: Tiny server matchups suck &amp; Glicko problems

A lot of people seemed to feel this problem would ""sort itself out"" if you just played enough matches

**Rather than me telling you ""I've done the math, and if you have a slow machine, remove the check mark from animation. Run about twenty fights.

You'll quickly notice that not only do bad matches happen a lot

*  ""tiny"" servers lose at the same time as normal servers
* and then they  end up fighting the losing normal servers subsequently.
* Likewise

Fixes include:

* pre-ranking servers based on population rather than alphabetization (pretty sure that happened in BWE2)
* dramatically increasing the RD for a server during the calculation of that round's points if they lose by orders of magnitude in point value
* this would force all low-pop servers to the bottom
* note that this should only be for losing
* make sure the RD is a reasonable value: as it approaches 1


&gt; WvW matches: Rapid **rank point inflation.**

When ArenaNet awards ""2"" wins for first place, the average server will gain ""1"" win point per fight (since 1st, 2nd, and 3rd are all equally likely) and the points begin spiralling out of control. Adding new servers when there's no longer an index value will mean new servers won't be placed correctly. It also boosts churn and contributes to anomalies. A server should in fact gain ""0.5"" points per fight on average, when correctly ranked, in order for Glicko to operate meaningfully. That would be 1 point and 0.5 of a point for 1st and 2nd. Don't believe me? [Try it out.](http://journals.rpgnexus.net/zenatrophy/gw2-thoughts/) 

* fix rank inflation by correcting point distribution to 1 and 0.5

&gt;WvW matches: **Stagnation** is a long term problem.

We haven't seen it because we've only been playing weekends, rather than just the nearest two servers, in order to keep combat fresh.


**Stonemist Early Game**
###############

&gt;  Stonemist is hugely vital. And it happens to be that it gets conquered in about 15 minutes on high-pop servers. 

I think this is not as fun as it could be. Stonemist should not be a 15-minute tug of war that goes to the guys with the fastest computers.

&gt; * I'd like to see Stonemist require siege weapons to conquer for the first time.*

It should be a day-1 victory in the first 4-8 hours of play

Here's just some of the valid strategies during the first couple of hours if Stonemist's neutral NPCs defend with arrow carts

* Solidy supply lines first for an early assault on SM before other teams are ready
* Capture a nearby keep and fortify it
* Run interdiction against enemy supply
* Ignore SM and make a frontal assault on an undefended homeworld
* Allow the other servers to breach SM outerwalls

These are just some of the valid strategies that can be employed when SM is not a minute-zero objective. Here's the valid strategy if SM is zergable:

* zerg Stonemist

So yes



**Commanders &amp; Squads**
###############

&gt; Commanders right now have a few key problems:

* Commanders without guilds must rely on recruiting from the zerg
* They do need a way to gather squads up. Relying on people to invite themselves wasn't happening
* Invites are good
* The objective icons they set are far too small. I couldn't even see them without looking
* They don't currently have a good way to communicate amongst themselves to coordinate

It remains to be seen what will happen when there are dozens of commanders running around the map. Will this diminish their usefulness?

**WvWvW Dungeon**
################

&gt; Someone recently complained that they didn't feel like they ""accomplished"" anything by doing the dungeon.

I actually agree with this. The blueprints don't really feel like you've contributed to the the ""world."" I'd love to see completing the dungeon give your server a small buff (like +10 power) for three or so hours. The buff should be more or less insignificant


**Final Week disaffection**
#######################
&gt; We haven't experienced this yet

At that point it will be obvious to one or two servers that they're just not going to win and they can't change that. Rather than having an exciting fight all the way to the end

&gt; I'd much rather see every team giving it their all in the last two days of WvW. There's a couple of ways to achieve this:

* ""Last holding"" bonus where the server gets some special benefits for the share of the map they held when the match end
* Boosting the point value of held zones
* Offering special quests to disrupt particular keeps or zones of the leading player(s) with rewards
* Potentially hide the points from the players
* Alternatively
* increasing frequency and impact of dynamic events towards the final day
* cap last day with mega-dynamic event


**Miscellaneous Bugs**
######################

* Specifically in WvW
* The supply gathered carries between matches. It should reset.
* WvWvW resets at 3 AM EST/12 AM PST give a huge early lead to Westcoast servers
* Supply mechanic needs a tutorial
* The wildlife often kills players before they can find teammates 
* Hard to find other people on low pop servers, often fight is over before they get there
* We die a lot more in WvW than in PvE. The armor should be damaged less frequently than in PvE to handle cash loss


**Fun Ideas**
######################
* special chests that spawn when a keep is held for 24 hours by a Guild. (encouraging defense over zerg)
* World Events for losing server to help turn the tide. Ride out from Rohan
* Dynamic events: ""Our scouts in the area discovered a lost crate of the enemy siege blueprints. Capture them in the next 30 minutes!""
* SM is fine at lower pop
*  A few more choke points in the map would add to strategic value of controlling mountain passes,False,self,t5_2r9po,1339846202.0,,,t3_v45tf

So...uh...yeah. Yesterday was kinda insane. I had intended to make Part 5 this morning but I had to talk about this first. Yall are awesome

 First

 Also

As for the market. Sorry. [This](http://gw2tp.com/i/2839) was shown to me by user cherise605 and kinda blew my mind.
 
 That was just one piece of the Traveler's set and I know these posts affected a large chunk of the items in the current market. I know this because I was trying to get some Gossamer Scraps and they had jumped in price as well....so kinda screwed myself there. All I can say is let the market stabilize over the next week or so and prices should go down I hope. 

 My goal with these posts was to help beginners who were struggling with the same things I struggled with on my way to 80. And also to give some guidance to level 80s who were feeling completely overwhelmed by Orr. HOPEFULLY, then those exotics will be converted to legendaries, and everyone will get cooler items for cheaper. I would like to think that given time, everyones overall wealth will increase because of these posts.

 Also, but I would prefer others in the community create their own posts about their own classes. I am really looking forward to the [Mesmer guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/zpd2b/as_promised_the_comprehensive_mesmer_guide_parts/) created by Prometheus0110. This is what our community was created for so be sure to thank him. 

When I finish with the last Part, please make a reply and I will modify my info. I was very happy to learn that I could get 4/6 of my armor set on my warr with Pow/Vit/Tough from a karma vendor. Though now I need to find a way to farm 120k+ karma....that'll be fun.

*NOTE: I found those 4/6 piece at Melandrus Temple in the Cursed Shore for 44k a pop. I could only afford the chest right now. The Helm and Boots did not have those stats so I had a couple Pow/Tough/Healing ones made for me.*

I will get started on the next Parts in a bit. Thanks again and see yall in game.

1353346556.0,13gj0p,Ascended gear and Infusions. How to make them and where they come from.,RedRedditRabbit,430,81,416,"Hi everyone! I'm a moderately active wiki editor and redditor and I'd like to consolidate all of the combined knowledge on Ascended gear and Infusions in one easy post here (since I know a lot of you don't read the wiki [SHAMELESS PLUG](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ascended)).

###Backslots

There are 2 versions of back slots: Quivers, which have a defensive infusion slot.

##The basic recipe
* 250 Teir 6 fine crafting material
* 1 Vial of Condensed Mists Essence
* 50 Globs of Ectoplasm
* 24 skill points

The skill points item determines whether you get a Quiver or a Book. 24 skill points worth of Philosopher stones will make a Quiver

There are 5 different variations of the back item, Karka Shells, and Dust do not have a recipe.

#Vials of Powerful Blood: **Quiver of Swift Flight / Book of Secrets**
* +24  Power 
* +17  Precision 
* +1%  Critical Damage 
* +32  Power 
* +18  Precision 
* +4%  Critical Damage

#Vicious Fangs: **Bowyer's Delight / Koss on Koss**
* +24  Power 
* +17  Toughness 
* +17  Vitality 
* +32  Power 
* +18  Toughness 
* +18  Vitality

#Ancient Bones: **Endless Quiver / Tome of the Rubicon**
* +17  Precision 
* +17  Toughness 
* +24  Condition Damage 
* +32  Condition Damage 
* +18  Precision 
* +18  Toughness

#Armored Scales: **Sights be True / Symon's History of Ascalon**
* +17  Power 
* +24  Toughness 
* +1%  Critical Damage 
* +32  Toughness 
* +18  Power 
* +4%  Critical Damage

#Vicious Claws: **Quiver of a Thousand Arrows / There With Yakkington: A Traveler's Tale**
* +17  Toughness 
* +17  Vitality 
* +32  Power 
* +18  Toughness 
* +18  Vitality 
* +5%  Magic Find

##Infused Back Slot

Once you've created a backslot item

The recipe to infuse a back slot is:

* Base back slot item
* Glob of Coagulated Mists Essence
* 250 Globs of Ectoplasm
* Gift of Ascension

###Rings

There currently isn't a lot known about ascended rings. What we do know is that you have a *chance* of getting an ascended ring from the daily chest (mini chest that appears above your minimap) at the end of fractal difficulty 10+ (aka Tier 2). More info in speculation section below.

###Infusions

There are 2 basic infusions that you can purchase inside the fractals

Additional Infusions can be crafted with the following recipe:

* 250 Karka Shells
* 100 Tier 6 Crafting Material
* 20 Mystic Coins
* Eldritch Scroll

Offensive Infusions have +5 to an offensive stat in addition to the +5 agony resistance.

* Malign Infusion +5 Condition Damage
* Mighty Infusion +5 Power
* Precise Infusion +5 Precision


Defensive Infusions have +5 to a defensive stat in addition to the +5 agony resistance.

* Resilient Infusion +5 Toughness
* Healing Infusion +5 Healing
* Soothing Infusion +2% Agony Duration Reduction
* Bounteous Infusion +1% Boon Duration
* Vital Infusion +5 Vitality
* Simple Infusion (Only +5 Agony Resistance)

All infusions have a normal version

**I'm not 100% on the above breakdown of which ones count as offensive and which ones count as defensive**

###Fractal Weapon Skins

These aren't directly related to ascended gear

###Agony

Agony is a debuff that isn't a condition (can't be removed by condition removal) that ticks away percentages of your health. Agony first shows up in tier 2 (10+) from special boss moves. With no agony resistance each tick will remove 1/8 (12.5%) of your health. Having just 5 agony resistance will cut that damage hit in half to 1/16 (6.25%).

I am unsure if agony hits harder in higher tiers

###Speculation

* I believe the Shards of Crystallized Mists Essence (possible drop in tier 3

* I have a feeling there are more recipes that use the Glob of Coagulated Mists Essence than the 2 that we have found.

* I assume that the Prototype Fractal Capacitor that can be purchased using Fractal Relics can be infused in the same manner as the 10 other back slot items

###Tertiary Info

Fractals are seperated into tiers. 1-9 is Tier 1, vials of essence can drop. 10-19 is tier 2, bosses cause agony, globs of essence can drop, daily chest can give you a ring. 20-29 is tier 3, more agony causing effects, mobs have additional abilities

There is a daily reward completion for each tier. Each tier has a different subset of possible rewards. I recommend at least doing the tier 2 (difficulty 10) daily each day as it has a chance to give you an Ascended ring.

###Closing

Any additional info (or corrections) are gladly welcomed. If you don't feel comfortable editing the wiki (I'm pretty terrible at it myself...) feel free to post info here and I'll get it in there.

**I have several ideas for solving this issue and**

First off, but mainly it is to allow more cash flow around these items, to give several of them more use and to just make them generally better.

**How to improve each individual item**:-     
**Town Cosmetics** - Purchasing and using these needs to apply them across your entire account similar to HoM items
**Combat Cosmetics** - Purchasing and using these should do EXACTLY THE SAME as the HoM. It's ridiculous that players should have to purchase transmutation stones in order to transfer these onto different sets of gear. Also
**Black Lion Keys / Chest Items** - Make them tradeable. At the moment, it fixes everything.       
**Fun Items** - Bind to account, and reward yourselves by getting more sales.    
**PvP Fun items** - Need to have a slot on your PvP gear (maybe use the back slot?) to put these in. The ones from the PvP chests should only be used for about 30 minutes

- If you cant see the ""join in"" option and you are in the same zone

- If its still not working

- The issue with ""join in"" not working sometimes or erroring seem to be because of issues with certain overflows

- Avoid playing in your character's home world unless all your party can get in there.

I'm not saying they shouldnt fix it

EDIT: By ""relogging"", so going to the mist, changing maps, etc, are solutions too.

Make sure the other people do that too

 - After a major event, where the guy spawned, and I had no idea. If it's the reward for event, I should know where it is. Give us a green arrow path, like on the story missions.  Column of light.  Something.
 - Take, dozens of bodies on the ground, and either npc's wandering around or items to click on to interact with, or weapons to pick up, it's tedious to go body to body. Or give me ""Loot Area All"" like in TOR.

1345903816.0,yt0sq,Overflow and you,qZeta,403,60,105,"**What's an overflow?** Whenever you try to join a region such as Queensdale or Divinity's Reach, you'll need to wait

**What's the problem of overflows?** Many people actually get confused when they first visit an overflow shard. They aren't familiar with the system yet, telling them they should get off their precious world and go into their own, for examples if a player from [Abaddon's Mouth [DE]::Queensdale] gets on an overflow. Also it's sometimes hard to get on the same overflow if you try to group with other people, for example if player A is on [Queensdale::Overflow #1] and player B on [Queensdale::Overflow #3].

**How can I check whether I'm on an overflow?** Usually a message will appear when you enter the specific zone. If you happen to miss the message

**What should I do when I'm on an overflow?** Just continue playing. If you try to group with other players in the same overflow, I guess this has to do with authentification aka login issues).

If you encounter someone who doesn't seem to understand the overflow system, explain them the system. It's one thing to hate someone for his actions, but a greater deed to tutor someone into a happier experience.

**How long do I have to stay on an overflow?** That depends completely on your world's region's load. It can take up to one hour

Don't forget, the more you'll help. Hopefully this helps some people to handle overflow situations. See you all in game, when the log in servers are ready again.

1374721441.0,1j04fg,Proposed effects of Charisma/Nobility/Aggression on characters,Orikami,394,49,104,"**Plain and simple:** Charisma/Nobility/Aggression would be much more interesting if it affected the way your character composed themselves in some way.  It could effect things like:

**Character stance in and out of combat** - Charismatic characters may lean on a staff less, a noble character could stand perfectly straight, their movements maybe more reserved, and an aggressive character in combat may be more hunched or simply lower to the ground than others


**Character idle animations** - Charismatic character may smile and be more lively, while an Aggressive character may survey the area, squinting or raising a hand to get a better survey of an area

**Animations made when conversing with an NPC** - Charismatic characters would be animated, while an aggressive character would be slightly dismissive, perhaps crossing their arms or keeping their body language closed

The thing is, fleshing out the systems they have in place already may be easier than adding new emotes and stuff, but I guess this would present it's own issues as well.It should also be noted that I know some of these may not be entirely practical and it should go for lore accuracy and such first before simply being silly about it lest we end up with disconnected characters and actions.

1373144113.0,1hrm83,tPvP Build List. (Up to date builds as of the June 25 patch.),DantesS_P,410,67,125,"Hello my name is Dantes. I keep an up to date build page for my guildmates. A few of them recommended that I share it with more people. Not all builds are created equal and some builds require different mind sets. So here are 3 different sets of builds for each class that are up to date and viable in ranked matches. I say ranked matches as you will see builds run tournaments on Twitch

Basically this is a meta tPvP build list. 

**Elementalist**

* [S/D Double Arcane](http://intothemists.com/calc/?build=-k34;2R0-P0w47N-Z0;9;5J-JT;159;204-45A5o0;3sV2DsV2D4BB): This is the standard S/D Ele build and very popular. It hits really hard

* [D/D triple cantrip](http://intothemists.com/calc/?build=-k33;2R0VU015-N-Z0;9;59-TT;10;348B45A4o0;3sV2DsV2D4BX): The famous D/D triple cantrips build has recently fallen out of meta due to nerfs to cantrips and buffs to other builds. Though people still run it and it's a viable build

* [Fresh Air S/D Burst](http://intothemists.com/calc/?build=-k34;2R0-U015-N-Z0;9;5T-9T;159B;14;045A5w0;3Ewk2Ewk25Bu): This is the new S/D burst build. It uses a berserk amulet instead of a Valkyrie amulet and has less points in water making it very squishy. But it hits like truck and fresh air allows for consistent air bursts. 


**Necromancer**

* [Condition Terror/Dhummfire](http://intothemists.com/calc/?build=;044Z;1kHFG0A4oJkJ0;9;4TJ9-904A48-1;32;0EJG4;2hoHAhoHA2Vr): The new Dhummfire/Terror build is very powerful and gives Necro large amounts of counter pressure. The base of the build is simply 30/20/0/0/0 with 20 points free to spend. Some variations of the build are 20 in Death magic in order to buff staff or 20 in Soul reaping for Master of Terror. Feel free to place them where you prefer. 

* [Minion Master](http://intothemists.com/calc/?build=;04-_;1kH-D0z3oI-K0;9;4J-JT-08;229-16A;1XNV7;2nBnBnBnB6gF): MM is surprisingly effective at times but in other times you will be yelling profanities at your minions. The build isn't very popular but is very powerful in it's own way and should not be quickly dismissed. 

* [Zerker Wellmancer](http://www.intothemists.com/calc/?build=;04-8c;0kHFJ0D4wJVJ0;9;4TJ-J-07B57;207;2LNV45;1sV2DsV2D5Bd): Power builds have always been less popular than condition builds on Necro. But wells are very strong AoE damage and Lich Form with a zerker amulet hits incredibly hard. 

**Mesmer**

* [Burst Shatter](http://intothemists.com/calc/?build=-NFcg;1VPV11A7JVF71;9;4JJ;0T06-39;505A5wl6;2sV2DsV2D5Bi): The most common build in tPvP due to it being strong in team fights and strong in 1v1. Portal is arguably the strongest utility skill in the game and Moa is very strong at shutting down bunkers. 

* [Phantasm S/P Greatsword](http://intothemists.com/calc/?build=-Ng-FR;0VPVz0O7kWF71;9;4JJ-T-29-18;2345;1U-V0U;1sV2DsV2D5BB): Phantasm builds where nerfed in the last patch and they where never popular in tPvP to begin with. But they are still considered very strong in 1v1s and are still very much viable. 

* [Condition Shatter](http://intothemists.com/calc/?build=-N3SZ;1VPkz0y6JVV71;9;49O9-O4;049-4;345-Uok6;2hoHAhoHA2VC): The condition Mesmer has similar problems as a phantasm Mesmer. Very strong in 1v1 but very much okay in team fights. Condition shatter is very hard to deal with since Mesmer packs survivability with their clones and condition damage. Destroying them causes conditions on you but not destroying them causes conditions on you. 

Moa Morph vs Time Warp: These two elites are interchangeable and they are both considered very stong. I have won fights because of Time Warp and I have also won fights because of Moa Morph. 

**Engineer**

* [HGH](http://intothemists.com/calc/?build=-VRR;2Z;0h0m5cQFx0;9;4T9-T-49A5;319A;1a-1;3hoHAhoHA2VI): Has recently fallen out of meta but still very powerful. The amulet and runes are usually up to person preference. Rabid and Rampager are the two most common amulets. And Might duration runes or standard Condition runes are also choices. 

* [Nodefighter/Teldo Style Engi](http://intothemists.com/calc/?build=VVRw;0B-cPVv0c-gTFx0;9;4T9-J92475;308-5;0Uw;1w0-hoHAhoHA2cT): This build is very strong in 1v1s but has a very noticeable skill floor. A player that is skilled with this build will wipe the floor of almost anyone but a player that uses it poorly will have major difficulties. Teldo is the player the popularized this build.

* [Static Discharge](http://intothemists.com/calc/?build=-V70;2sPFn0l6gSFx0;9;5T-9T;158A;10;0157I;5sV2DsV2D5Bq): This build isn't very popular but with the recent buff of Rocket Boots. I've seen more Engis run this by swapping out Rifle Turret for Rocket Boots. The mobility from rifle and Rocket Boots is pretty amazing. 

**Ranger**

* [BM Ranger](http://intothemists.com/calc/?build=-FF37k;0wE-u-d2kDV-0;9-0a;3T9T;436A2;054BVV-7E;1nBnBnBnB9FS): This build received some much needed nerfs but is still powerful. The most common role of this build is holding the off points. It is strong 1v1 and still tanky enough to hold out for back up to show up. Pets are either felines or birds.  [Cleric Variation](http://intothemists.com/calc/?build=-FF3g;1wE-u-d2kDV-0;9V83;3T9T;436A2;054BWVF7;2nBnBnBnB3NJ)

* [Spirit Ranger](http://intothemists.com/calc/?build=-F7kF3;0wEFx-n2wDk-0;9k2a;29TT;25;036A36A;1KwF4F;1hoHAhJG42Vh): Not very popular but Spirits are noticeably much more powerful in tPvP than they are in PvE. This build is surprisingly strong in 1v1 but is also a tremendous asset in team fights. 

* [Trap Ranger](http://intothemists.com/calc/?build=-FFkV;1wEFy-v2oEF-0;9k2D;2TT9;247A28A2;3Ewl6;2jwmAjwmA2VH): Has fallen out of the meta but is still considered strong. The main reason people stop playing it was BM ranger did it's job at holding off points better. But this brings large amounts of AoE during team fights and is pretty good at holding the home point. 

* [Shout Heal](http://intothemists.com/calc/?build=-F7kF3;1FFt-p2kDk-0;9-0a;3TT9;436A27B2;0WVF7;2nBnBnBnB9cn). Thank you [/u/nightsfrost](http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/1hrm83/tpvp_build_list_up_to_date_builds_as_of_the_june/cax7rap) This is a newer build that boasts larger amounts of sustain than standard BM ranger but at a slight cost of pet damage. 

**Thief**

* [D/P Burst](http://intothemists.com/calc/?build=-c3RV;1RwV0-6-FOFd0;9;4OT;0E28-07A;43;05BW4;2G3G3G3G35Bn): This is the standard 100-0 burst build. If you are new to the class I recommend OH Dagger instead of OH pistol. It is a very strong build and easily punishable if you are a poor player but still sees much high level play. 

* [S/D S/D Evade](http://intothemists.com/calc/?build=-cF3F3;0Vwk0-J5JOFd0;9;49T-T-2;027A;128B;1UNk65;1KJG4KJG45Bv): This build has seen some nerfs but is still very strong. It is a very difficult build for an opponent to lock down but doesn't have the insane burst of other thief builds. This build is also know as the Jumper build by the player that popularized it. 

* [Dantesway](http://intothemists.com/calc/?build=-c3RF3;0RwVb06-FOkd0;9;4OTE;020-05A4;65BW0L;1G3G3G3G35BK): I needed another thief build so I added mine. This build is very high burst and uses MH sword for great effect in team fights. But this build is also very hard on initiative. If you fluff a Black Powder/Heartseeker combo or spam 3 on this build

* [D/P Burst Variation](http://intothemists.com/calc/?build=-c3RV;1RwV0-6-FOFd0;9;49T;0T2;007A;436B5BW4;2G3G3G3G35Bb) Some players prefer traiting heavier into trickery due to the powerful traits in that line. But this has lower the potential damage. 

The skill [Shadow Trap](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Shadow_Trap) is kinda amazing now. It is basically a personal portal and can be used as such. Though it is kinda buggy if you want it is possible implementing it in the above builds. 

**Guardian**

* [Mid Bunker](http://www.intothemists.com/calc/?build=-73xs;1NFk40J3kF-90;9;69TT;44;048A2895wl6;2ZF18ZF183NV): This is the standard mid point bunker. The weapon choice is actually up to the guardian

* [DPS Triple mediatation](http://intothemists.com/calc/?build=-7Fwg;1NFF30I3wF-90;9;5TT44;139A09B;45NW0;2G3G3G30D5kU): The standard variation of this build is X/30/30/X/X so you are given 10 points to place where you want them. You can also replace the greatsword with scepter/X if you prefer that. 

* [DPS Symbol AH](http://intothemists.com/calc/?build=-7Bdg;1NFk20M3BG-90;9;59TT;23;049A269;1LJV4;2sV2DsV2D5kl): AH builds are fundamentally weaker in tPvP than they are in WvW or PvE. They require other players to be around in order to be incredibly effective. Since outside of large team fights you tend to only have one other ally instead of 4 the survivability is much lower. But it does benefit DPS builds since their survivability is already low. Though this build is still not very popular due to Bunker Guard being such an incredible asset to a team it can still be powerful. Variations include staff and hammer

**Warrior**

* [Destruction of the Empowered Burst](http://intothemists.com/calc/?build=-sg-7w;0VKFM0h4cL-60;9;4TJ;0J18A49;557-I-V0L;1KJG4KJG45BI): There are several variations to Warrior burst. I am merely one version of hard burst warrior. Destruction of the Empowered is very strong at punishing enemies. Burst Warriors and Burst Thieves should rarely be the first ones to enter a fight. They should roam around see a fight and back up their allies. This is where DotE shines

* [Zerker Longbow Sword/Shield](http://intothemists.com/calc/?build=-sFwo;1RK-Q0d4NL-60;9;5TJ-J;127A08;257-LRV4;2CoF2CoF25ke): This build is growing to be very popular. It is a rather different build than most players are used to. But it is very powerful build with burst and mobility from sword and AoE pressure from longbow. I had a pug match the other day where 3 warriors on the enemy team where running this build.  [The Defektive build](https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/professions/warrior/Defektive-s-New-Meta-New-Patch-New-Build). 

* [Mace/Shield Greatsword Burst](http://www.intothemists.com/calc/index.php?build=-sg-BxFCRK-Q0f4cL-60L4kLVN0h4kG;5JJ-T;139-28;247AL-V4C;1CoF2CoF25kC) Cleansing Ire is proving to be a powerful trait that is bringing other weapons into viability. The premise of this build is using Skull Crack to stun the opponent for 3s (+Sigil of Paralyzation) allowing you plenty of time to hundred blades.  

Utility skills/Traits/Sigils/Runes and sometimes weapons can often be modified in the above builds. Say I recommended Runes of Divinity but if you prefer Runes of the Ogre. You can swap out for Runes of the Ogre and it will be just as strong if not stronger. Most players will make their own modifications to a build depending on the team comps or playstlye preferences. 

Disclaimer: I'm no pro player but I have played hundreds of tournament matches. I'm a Champion Shadow and am working on Champion Paragon. My personal best was the Top 300 and I used to lead a team where one of my members was in the Top 100. So I kinda know what I'm talking about but I always continue to learn and play better. So if I made a blatant mistake in one of the above builds

-Dantes

If you see me in matches I""m probably on my Thief Dantesa Night or my Guardian Cadea Tayls.

Anyway

* **Vitality and Power** are your two most important stats early on, and your armor is high enough early on that Toughness isn't as important as Vitality.

* **Upgrade your armor frequently.** It makes a tremendous difference for all your stats

On a related note, 50, 65 and 80, so those are good times to change your wardrobe.

* **If you're going to craft

* **Defensive Utility Skills** should be a priority over offensive ones while you're still learning the game. Sure that huge firestorm is fun

* **Don't neglect lower level content.** Turning your nose up at an area 5 levels bellow you and trying to complete hearts 2-4 levels higher than your character can make for some pretty difficult and frustrating leveling. You won't lose out on much experience if you're a few levels above your area and it will be a ton easier. In particular

In particular I found that from level 30 to 50 it's hard to keep up with the flow of PvE zones

* **Don't feel you have to stay in your race's zone!** Content will often level up faster than you do

* **Racial skills are crappy**, Radiation Field, Warband Support and Hounds of Balthazar, but still skip them if you're unsure.

* **Salvage Whites, but the opposite is true for Blue or above.

In my last game I managed to cap a point and hold it the entire match. I thought I'd get something for managing to do that but nope in the end i got 2 glory for simply being in the match and due to me getting 0 kills (they never attacked full scale only 1-2 and ran when they got low). I understand that it's probably there to stop feeders just standing about but give something to defenders/supporters even if they don't get kills.

I play as a defense-support Guardian traited and skilled to last long while still still being able to heal and buff yet I get nothing in the long run while the full on dmg people fighting inbetween points are getting ""top player x"" rewards.

Figured out quite a few chat codes that I felt some people would love to use. These chat codes differ from item codes because they are actual things the NPCs will say. The chat codes are colored based on which chat they are entered into(general chat will be green, ect.)

In case you are not familiar with chat/item codes

The way these work(from as far as I've been able to figure out) is they have to have these in the chat code [&amp;Az**--**AAA=] and the **--** are replaced with a capital and lower case combo like ""**Ab**"" for example. Most of them will look like this[&amp;Az**Ab**AAA=]. The ""Az"" part of the code starts at ""Aw"" and works up to ""Az""(Credit to turinpt for pointing that out

1358454851.0,16rsh9,Jan 17 dev livestream summary,dulfy,400,64,588,"The livestream lasted 20 minutes and was 3 developers talking about PvE/sPvP/WvW. This is some rough notes that I took. 

This was the livestream if you missed it and want to watch it/re-watch it. http://www.twitch.tv/guildwars2/b/357921586

**Part 1**

**TL:DR**

* Incoming AoE ability balancing (nerf) - they are too effective right now
* Removing rez rushing in dungeons - i.e. can't WP if group members are in combat. Reducing difficulty on some of the more challenging encounters

* New achievement system to encourage players to go back to the deserted zones &amp; guilds stuff

* sPvP: custom areans. leaderboards

* WvW - working on introducing progression

* Class balance to bring up the weaker weapons/traits

**What is our long term focus for PVE and how we are bringing left back to deserted zones**

* New achievement system that plays into dailies/monthlies that adds new style of gameplay
* New achievements to encourager cooperative play – i.e. rezzing
* Allow players to filter back into some of the deserted zones (i.e. this month’s monthly  achievement for jumping puzzles was used as an example)
* New content with the guilds – 4-5 different styles of content that show up in the world that guilds can go in to help kick off and pull other players into it as well. 
* Adding tiers to guild economy/ear guild tabs
* &gt;100 new rewards tied to the achievement system/guilds to allow players to show off some of the cool stuff they have done. 
* Framework rolling out next couple months
* New Ascended items coming into play outside FOTM with the new achievement/reward system. 

**Philosophy on the dungeons**

* Multiple phase change for the dungeons – first build – remove the idea of rez rushing (i.e. only way to beat some of the difficult encounters at the moment is to have dead players run back from nearby waypoints while players that are alive kite the mobs)
* You can no longer able to rez (I think he meant waypoint here)  if someone in dungeon is in combat
* We are nerfing some of the encounters that are a bit more challenging
* Phase 2 – go back and look at some of the encounters – retune and increase difficulty if necessary. 
* New rewards (no details)

**LFG mechanics**

* We are working right now on a system that go across the board

**sPvP**

* Working on custom arenas – need to make sure it is bug free
* Working on leaderboards – see your progress against other people
* New player experience for PvP – better matchmaking system – play with players of your skill level. 
* Working on a new 1 team vs 1 team version of our tournament system 
* This new tournament version will be on Temple of Silent Storm map (this map has a lot of tournament potential).  
* Blog post coming up to talk more 
* Adding more PvP specific armor skins – i..e skins that are available in PvE but not in PvP. 

**WvW**

* Looking into progression in WvW to give you some kind of character development and rewards 
* Goal is to progression/rewards. Encourages more players to do WvW.
* Recently tested culling – we are doing great things with culling – running a lot of different tests/tweaks.
* Our WvW programmer talks about more on the official GW2 forums. 
* Adding more PvP specific armor skins – i..e skins that are available in PvE but not in PvP. 

**Upcoming AoE skill balancing (nerf)**

* One of the issues brought up a lot in WvW./sPvP is AoE (Area of Effect). We feel like they are too strong at the moment and a lot of people in WvW are gaming the system using AoEs. 
* For people that don’t know – max targets for siege weapons is 50 while max targets for AoE is 5. 
* Reducing AoE effectiveness to bring them in line with the single target damage skills. 
* Major update coming to all the AoE skills – make classes that are good at single target damage stand out a bit more.
* Same thing with dungeons – right now if you have a lot of AoE you can past encounters by just spamming AoE which is not what we want. 

**Philosophy inside weapons and class balance**

* We want every single class to feel like they have multiple options to deal with every situations
* We want every single class to deal situations in an unique manner – we keep “purity” in certain skills/traits  i.e. only mesmers and thieves have stealth to deal with some situations. Not everyone have stealth but every class have a defensive mechanism they can use if they don’t stealth. 
* We want to bring up all the weak weapons/traits on par with strong weapons/builds/traits in addition to reduce AoE effectiveness.
* A lot of  classes have 1-2 good builds while some  have 5-6 builds 


**Part 2 - Q&amp;A** (Part 2 is in super rough draft format, editing it when i get to rewatch)


**Q: How close do you feel each class fulfill the class philosophy**

* We use one set of balance numbers for wvw
* Some classes are filling their roles
* We are brining up the weaker builds to be on par with the good builds. 
* So yes they are but there are more work to be done.

**Q: Expain what you mean by progress in WvW**

* We are encourage people to defend
* Reward the individual player for what they are doing rather than contribute scoring via server

**Q: Culling fixes available in WvW, when?**

* Depends on testing – WvW atm is bad, Shatter event)
* We are testing the system in WvW and hopefully it will affect all across the board.

**Q: Fractals**

* Adding reconnect to fractals
* Able to start at the highest fractal level achieved by any group member – it will advance everyone who is eligible for advancement up one tier 
* You will be rewarded based on your personal level

**Q: Dynamic system in open worlds – how will it evolve – make it more understandable

* Changes to Orr at end of month – adding some new effects
* Continue building lore/story – between content patches we will add in new events

**Q: Stance on allowing people to see enemy nameplates in WvW**

* Mixed feeling – we want server to viewed as a whole and not introduce bitterness to individual players
* Not completely opposed to the idea – be interesting to get bragging rights
* Not sure how to design around that at the moment
* Need to make it voluntary
* WvW is about large scale massive battle mentality where individual players are not as important

**Q: Advancement/prestige  design for wvw**

* We want to keep things consistent – similar to some other stuff in the game. Can;’t talk much

**Q: How does dev priorize development time – new content or old content bug fixes?**

* We want to to do bug fixes first then add in new content.
* We looked at dungeons across the board
* Specific teams to focus on different areas of the game to make sure no area is left behind.

**Q: Do you think classes will have more weapon combinations sometime in the future? (i.e. Eles using greatswords)**

* Great question

**Q: Examples to make boss more interesting**

* Different mechanics when bosses get to a different health stage etc like some of the fractal bosses.
* We now have more better tools to develop boss scripts. 

**Q: WvW and ascended gear?**

* It is an idea being tossed around – use the badge system perhaps.
* I am hopeful that it will.

**Q: Custom areans – new game modes? cost to host?**

* Yes
* You can’t create an entirely new gamemode but you can turn some features on/off.
* I know you guys want new gamemodes like CTF

**Q: GvG – Guild vs Guild**

* Guilds battle in guild halls – you had a flag
* We see it more as the team 5vs 5 stuff in GW2 and in custom arenas

**Q: New game modes?**

* We want to use conquest as the base and develop around it
* We can maybe we can implement some elements from other gamemodes. 
* Why do we keep to conquest? If you want something to grow
* New mode – pushing the boundaries of what conquest can do arriving sometime before the death of the universe. 

**Q will GW2 become a ESPORT?**

* Yes, better streaming support
* Releases later in the year. 

**Q: Do you agreee with the statement the current metagame is boring**

* Current metagame is boring
* Bunker – a class is a class that hold down a position
* We don’t  want to be case that every team needs a bunker. 
* Bring builds to all classes to what the bunkers are currently. 
* Eles are tough, so are thieves. 

**Q: Do you find any profession to be out of balance? Like Ele bunker, mesmer portal?**

* Ele bunker is really strong
* Mesmer portal is giving us problems –giving that tool onto other classes

**Q: Reward screen for the new crowns for the achievements**

* If you are playing a specific class
* A chest containing stuff that your class that you can use.
* Not class specific armor etc. 

**Q: Get crowns for achievement we already have?**

* First build only have crowns for daily and monthly achievements. 
* Later phase will have crowns are other achievement.
* New daily and monthly achievements tied to new content – allow to pick specific rewards you care about. 
* Feb’s monthly will reward crowns 
* Crowns are a new type of currency

**Q: Elaborate your plans for changing AoEs**

* This is not a quick fix
* If your skil does 10 damage to a single target
* Maybe add a new mechanic where mobs are resistant to AoE damage.
* In PvP and WvW we see people using AOEs on enemy players rezzing other etc",self,t5_2r9po,1358463936.0,,Mesmer,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/16rsh9/jan_17_dev_livestream_summary/

**RE: Safety**

I made this with only the guild wars API in order to be as legit as possible.  There's no hooking functions or interacting with the game itself in any way.  As such


**Details**

Left click on an event to see the event name.

Right click to minimize and restore the map.  This is useful if you only have 1 screen.  You can keep the small version in a corner and click to pull it up.

There are a few options in the config file that you may want to look at.  Those with older computers can lower the zoom level or turn on slowload to improve performance.

This is fully functional

Edit: Updated

Edit 2: This now supports single screens if you run it in windows full screen.  Right click to shrink/restore the map window.  config file added so you can change the zoom level. Zoom 5 or 6 is much faster but less detailed.

Edit 3: The config file can let you see events in preparation by setting Prep=1.

Edit 4: You can now filter out skill challenge and group events.  Group events are now purple and skill challenges are green.

In the coming hours

We’d like to remind everyone that we do not seek to punish, we expect everyone who appealed to honor their commitment to destroy all illegitimate gains, whether those are crafting items, currencies, or the weapons themselves. To remove currencies, making a purchase of appropriate value and destroying that purchase will suffice. 

We would also like to acknowledge that we are not free from blame. In a game this big, communicative and efficient manner. What constitutes an exploit, and what has resulted in these suspensions, is using a flaw in the game to gain an unfair advantage over other players that is clearly not in line with the design of the game. Please remember, opportunity does not equal permission.

We also understand that sometimes the consequences of such an exploit may not be clear or apparent. In these cases, many of you stated that you only purchased large quantities of weapons to use for personal gain and not for profit. Such an act devalues the time and effort put forth by every other player who opts not to take advantage of an exploit. We will be publishing a FAQ on exploits soon.

On the subject of your appeals, we will strive to maintain only the highest of standards for the game and the community, and we ask that you do the same.

As one player noted in his appeal, or by sending an e-mail to exploits@arena.net.

All of that said

1357507314.0,162v35,How average users can save the Guild Wars 2 economy. ,GW2ReformedTycoon,503,168,368,"First off let me give you a little bit of background, and finding ways to extract 100's and sometimes 1000's of gold out of the markets and away from other players became exciting and fun. I had no plans or goals in mind for the money besides increasing my own power to manipulate markets.

I am making this post because I have been removed from the game due to my snowflake exploiting, regardless I accept my ban from the game and in retrospect I realize most of my actions in game have actually been hurting the in game economy, and all of you. It's probably a good thing that I am no longer allowed into the marketplace. 

As one of the players who saw ways to manipulate and profit from market I can say the number one problem to the guild wars economy is not exploiters (although they are clearly a problem), those who are not looking will become poorer over time, and eventually unable to compete in the unfair trading waters of the plutocracy. 

The markets are already mostly run by wealthy players, even when making steady normal profit. The other would be information suppression by those players currently making hundreds of gold off of these unbalanced markets.

It seems the prevailing notion in this community is there is nothing you can do to the wealthy players, and detail what the average user can do to fix it, and at the same time make a modest amount of gold for yourself. Once the markets are relatively balanced again I think the Guild Wars 2 economy will be in a much more stable and equal position.

#1 Tier 5 Materials -&gt; Globs of Ectoplasm 

This is the craft and salvage market,000's in the matter of an hour.

You can currently pick up Tier 5 Materials at a cost of around 95 copper. For 15 of them and about 4-5 silver in silk,000's of salvages and made thousands of gold from this market can confirm master kits return higher than the others and at a rate of .9 ecto per item. (9 ectos per 10 items salvaged on average)

This allows you to turn 20 silver into .9 ectos, and stop the guild wars 2 economy wealth gap from continuing to split. 

Major -&gt; Superior 

Similar returns are possible on material upgrading. Specifically major runes to superior runes, but if you put 100 gold in you can expect 130 gold out. There is still risk of not hitting any good runes in smaller sample sizes and losing money. Maintaining these markets requires knowing the average cost of the superior rune markets, and that takes a lot more time to watch and maintain. If there is enough community demand I can go into the numbers of this market to show the profit margins.

There are also quite a few other smaller markets that I could share if there is enough interest in this. I just don't want to spend any more time on this if there is not.

I am not sharing this information so a few reddit members can make gold trading as well, and I doubt anyone making hundreds of gold from it would give out this information and destroy their own money making machine I might as well make this information public, and leave the fate of the Guild Wars 2 economy up to the larger community.

1361250470.0,18suws,A simple explanation of why the bleed cap needs to be removed.,ExtraPotential,416,91,449,"Lets assume we are hitting a mob with 20% damage reduction as both a Warrior to represent direct damage and then a Necromancer to represent condition damage:

(damage stats will be extreme so as to help illustrate my point. Necromancers are not capable of maintaining 25 bleeds individually for example)

* Warrior capable of hitting for 4

* Necromancer capable of maintaining 25 stacks of 150 damage bleeds. Necromancer hits mob for 3

Now lets see what happens when we add additional players:

* 10 Warriors capable of hitting for 4

* 10 Necromancers capable of maintaining 25 stacks of 150 damage bleeds. Necromancers hit mob for 3

Notice the issue? That is what everyone frustrated by condition caps are complaining about.

Finally

* 5 Warriors capable of an additional 2 bleeds at 50 damage each, Necromancers hit for 3,450 as bleeds are replaced by weaker short duration Warrior versions only allowing the Necromancers 15 stacks at a time, actually reducing their damage despite the addition of the direct damage from attacks.

This is exactly what happens in every group fight in the game. Condition damage classes are forced into the ground and denied relevance. This is why you should never include more than one condition dealer per group as long at the ridiculous bleed caps stand. 



EDITS:

* It is not a logical counter argument to suggest that high condition stacks caused by multiple players would kill too fast. It is currently possible for multiple players to kill FASTER with direct damage alone

   * DD source = X time to kill
   * 10 x DD source = X/10 
   * CD source = X 
   * 10 x CD source = X 
   * Therefore

* It appears that many are not familiar with how condition removal works. Any number of stacks of one type of condition count as one condition being removed. That means a skill that removes 1 condition will remove all 25 stacks of bleed if it removes the bleed condition.

* It is being said that removing the cap would imbalance PvE as bosses don't have condition removal. This is untrue for two reasons: 1. Many actually do have condition removal and 2. It's totally irrelevant to begin with

* It is not possible for any single player to maintain a stack of 25 bleeds, a max stat, full Rabid Necro running food, weapon and might buffs will waver between 2,000-3,000 max dps as bleeds are applied and fade. Raising the cap will not boost individual players damage to insane levels, in fact it will have no affect on solo players. Condition damage specs will never do as much dps as a direct damage burst spec

* Yes

   * target has 20 bleeds. surrounding enemies have 6. epidemic spreads 19 bleeds to a cap of 25.
   * target has 5 bleeds. surrounding enemies have 60 bleeds. epidemic spreads 0 bleeds as the cap has been surpassed.

* This is not a profession specific issue

* It is important when reading this post to comprehend that the issue applies just as much to PvP as PvE. Many are forgetting cripples/immobilize/blinds/launches/knockdowns/dodges and blocks do affect ability to apply and maintain conditions on a target,,False,self,t5_2r9po,1361332404.0,,True

Coming from behind halfway through the week Henge of Denravi beat out Gates of Madness and Darkhaven after an incredibly close week of fighting

As the week came closer and closer to an end the mood in world v world  hit an all time high. Some of the players present had been in the server since launch had had to endure week after week of bitter and frequently extreme defeat, has been a good experience.


Speaking personally, honorable opponents. 


And to my own server, and as our world v world crew has gotten more respect. We are one of the smallest population servers, if not the smallest, but we have achieved some great things with what we have. More importantly, the community is one of the friendliest I've met.


A lot of us here in HoD have been trying really hard to organise ourselves into a more competitive world v world server so it's great to see over a month of effort and organisation pay off with a victory. The times in the past have not been kind to us


Heres for more fun WvW

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thVuIZDdn80&amp;list=PL00553A085339802C&amp;index=7

I've been making videos about Guild Wars on youtube for a few years now and one of the most succesful series I ever did was retelling the story of Guild Wars 1 just before the sequel launched. We managed to complete prophecies back then

However, up until now, producing the next part!

I understand that excitement for this has likely dropped since launch

First, and I really want new players of the franchise to see what they could be missing.

I think for a lot of people Cantha was 'just that big annoying city' and they wouldnt flinch to hear that A.net doesn't plan to make it a part of Gw2 - and I really want to change that. The region has some of the most defined and interesting lore the series has to offer, environments and links to the elder dragons. **It's the dragon empire for petes sake!**

So hopefully this video will convince people otherwise. I do a bit of a disclaimer type thing in the video itself and leave some links for those interested

Yesterday I was doing spvp about 2 hours in I got dizzy and instantly puked. Everything in this game is damn near perfect except for this friggin camera lol.

After tireless searching the only info I found was #1 Im definitely not the only one #2 Anet will not comment on this? #3 they supposedly already increased this at some point&lt;----lol holy crap it was actually worse?.

I made a post about the camera distance on the technical forum yesterday asking why the camera was jerking around and zooming in and out for no reason. The thread was locked within 2 minute and disappeared? There was absolutely nothing in the post that was negative. 

That was damn near text book blizzard moderation there. I cant imagine people having technical issues going to the forums for help then getting their thread locked/vanished.

###T6 Mat Farm Guide

Much like many players, we're farming up all our T6 Mats.

##This guide includes farms for:

+ Vicious Fangs
+ Ancient Bone
+ Vials of Powerful Blood
+ Elaborate Totems
+ Powerful Venom Sacs
+ Vicious Claws
+ Piles of Crystalline Dust

##Non T6 Mats included:

+ Corrupted Lodestone
+ Charged Lodestone
+ Onyx Lodestone

##Some things to note:

+ If the farming zone is full of bots
+ MF is highly recommended if you want some more rare drops. I personally use [Spicy Pumpkin Cookies](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Spicy_Pumpkin_Cookie). But any [MF Consumable](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Magic_find#Consumables) is good.
+ These are developed to be ""semi afkable"" so you don't really have to worry about dieing unless you really aren't paying attention.

###Vicious Fang/Vials of Powerful Blood Farm

[Link to map] (http://i.imgur.com/2VySIXQ.jpg)

Here you will be killing [Reef Skelk](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Reef_Skelk). Basically run from the Cove


##Recommended Skills:

+ Speed Buffs (Signet of the Hunt, for example)
+ AoE Damage Skills (Any Ele

There is no Veterans on this run. Average in 45 minutes was about 5-10 of each Vicious Fangs and Vials of Powerful Blood.


---
###Powerful Venom Sac Farm

[Link to map](http://i.imgur.com/HRu07Y9.jpg)

Here you are killing [Reef Riders](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Reef_Rider) (and young Reef Riders). We basically run around in a circle

##Recommended Skills:

+ Speed Buffs (Same as above)

There is 2 Veterans for this. Fights are straight forward. Watch for confusion and a reflection dome that they create. It will reflect all projectiles.

---
###Vicious Claw and Ancient Bone Farms
[Link to map](http://i.imgur.com/jRnVSvq.jpg)

Here you are killing the [Ice Brood Colossus](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Icebrood_Colossus) and [Corrupted Quaggan](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Corrupted_Quaggan).

##Recommended Skills:

+ Speed Buffs (Same as above)
+ The ability to dodge

##Other noted drops:

+ Corrupted Lodestone

There are no veterans along this path.

---
###Elaborate Totem/Ancient Bone Farm

[Link to map](http://i.imgur.com/8OQcOx1.jpg)

Here you are killing the [Grawl](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Grawl). 

##Recommended Skills:

+ Speed Buffs
+ AoE Damage
+ AoE Pulls (Binding Chains


There are no veterans along this path. Tagging the ""friendly rabbits"" can also be benefical. They can drop loot. (For instance, got an Unidentified Dye that turned into a Celestial. Good times)

---
###Piles of Crystalline Dust/Charged Lodestone + Other Lodestones

* [Link to map 1](http://i.imgur.com/cpwpvoL.jpg)
* [Link to map 2](http://i.imgur.com/TDnxXVD.jpg)

(First picture) Here you are primarily killing the [Sparks](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Spark) and [Air Elementals + Vets](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Air_Elemental). There is also [Ice Elementals](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ice_Elemental) (Corrupted Lodestones) and [Embers](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ember) (Onyx Lodestone or Molten?) within the ring. There are multiple Veterans. **You will need to open the Temple of Lyssa for this one.**

(Second Picture) Here you are killing ONLY Sparks and Air Elementals. There is four total veterans. An event will spawn where a champion risen knight will appear. **You will need to open the Temple of Dwayna for this one.**

Note! The drop rate on the Charged Lodestone is low (as compared to say, the value of charged lodestones and the value of the Crystalline dust, we figure it's still a decent farm. Shocking Crystals are dropped often, and add up quickly, which can be sold for a good chunk of silver after every 30-40 minutes.

##Recommended Skills:


+ Speed Buffs (Same as above)

---
###Other notes:

+ I have not yet found a good place to farm Armored Scales outside of the WvWvW Borderlands Central Lake (the Krait there)
+ Don't forget
+ Bring a friend! Having someone else to chat with/run with makes things less dull!
+ Listen to music!

Right now as you level to 80

However

At level 80, however the karma and experience rewards are really, REALLY low and I don't feel that the invested time is worth it.

To alleviate this

The point of this idea is to incentivize level 80s to go explore and spend time in places other than just Orr

Right now, and eventually there will be a critical mass of those players farming and zerging down content.  With this tweak to the downleveling system, the population in Orr would not be so extreme, people could play the content they wanted without feeling like they're not being rewarded for it, and in general I think the entire game world will feel a lot more ""alive""

**Abstract (TL;DR):**

An analysis of a significant sample of salvagable materials has shown that salvaging mechanics are not affected in and of themselves by magic find in N≤500.

**Background &amp; Research:**

There have been studies on salvaging with different kits and if the anti-bot code has any impact on salvaging. However

**Hypothesis:**

Increasing the magic find stat will lead to a greater quality or quantity of materials from salvage items.

**Materials &amp; Methods:**

In order to test this hypothesis a large number of salvageable items were needed. To fill this requirement Rags were chosen for four reasons. First, a large number of Rags are relatively easy to acquire and because they are the same item will eliminate many potential sources of error, such as a varying loot table which would affect this study the most. Finally, because of the testing on diminishing returns, we have a control sample with an equal amount of samples.

Mystic Salvage Kits were used for the salvaging for two reasons. First

Gear worn (assuming Magic Find stacks additively) produces a total of +108% Magic Find (6 x 3% from armor + 10% from Superior Rune of the Traveler + 50% from 5 Superior Runes of the Pirate + 15% from accessories + 15% from accessory upgrades).

500 Rags were used as the sample group to mimic the control study.

**Materials:**

*Mystic Salvage Kit – 2

*Rag – 500

For consistancy

The Rags and Mystic Salvage Kits were acquired at 8.00 EST 26/9 and salvaging took place after 10.00 EST 26/9.

The account and character has not looted nor salvaged in the last 24 hours in order to establish another baseline within reasonable limits.

Since diminishing returns/anti-bot code was already studied

**Results:**

500 Rags yielded 732 (x=1.464) Silk Scraps and 72 (x=.144) Gossamer Scraps. Finally

I've spent the last week leading my server through several siege based events

There are a few problems I have with it.  First, the control scheme that doesn't exist with squads.  Last, some personal opinions of the concept I'll go over.

Currently the method of becoming a Commander is to gather 100g and buy a book.  There is no WvW involved, and you too can be trusted by the server to know how to take down a door without ever doing it.  This is BAD.  At the very least, it should require the equivalent of basic knowledge of how to play WvW, if that is the intention of the Commander ability.  I would suggest a 1,000 Badge of Honor requirement on top of the 100g, for starters, and possibly some way to verify that you have a guild backing (item through influence points

With multiple commanders comes confusion.   I believe this is partially caused by the extremely poor squad system.  This creates substandard strategy in situations where multiple commanders are not needed.  

Squads are a mess.  There is no interface involved with squads.  You can't invite players, which allows you to drag and drop objectives with a number of players associated with them, as well as to be able to see who/what are where which would actually be useful. 

Below is just my opinion of what commander's compendium should be changed to.

War Standard

 - Icon on Map like you have now
 - Commander carries a Standard
 - Grants buffs to himself and surrounding players equivalent to the Orb bonus
 - Is made in the mystic forge with an item equivalents of: 100 skill points, 100,000 karma, and 100g. 
 - May only be activated once per day

To me, but guild leadership should be the strategical center of GUILD wars, not some random guy with 100g.",,False,self,t5_2r9po,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/10szpl/they_need_to_change_commanders_theres_no_way/

**Edit 2**: Prices have changed significantly due to this guide. I'm appending the prices *I* paid at the bottom so you can compare them to market prices at the moment to identify anything that may be out of whack before you spend your money.

**Edit 3: The prices of many of the items on this shopping list have increased dramatically and following this guide would cost you much

-------------

I didn't start cooking before the infamous nerf and ever since then I've then been looking for an updated guide. There are a few out there but none of them had everything I was looking for so I made my own. 

Because there are so many paths to take when leveling cooking you need to prioritize. Here are the goals I set and met for my guide:

- No need to run to high-level karma vendors for any ingredients (like cherries
- Avoid items that the market can put a stranglehold on (though there are a couple)
- Include a complete shopping list so you can buy everything at once
- Be able to go to the Trading Post
- Keep cost to a reasonable minimum

I understand that not everyone wants to powerlevel. Some people like figuring things out and getting all the recipes. This guide is not for those people. This is for someone who has money to burn and wants to quickly and easily add 10 levels to an alt. I also know that leveling via discovery *may* be more efficient in terms of money (I'm not sure)

This guide has been tested on four different characters. It makes sense given current market conditions but I recognize those may change over time

The cost for me was under 2g

Note that the cooking merchant sells most things in stacks of 10 so you will have to overbuy a few things.

I also want to say in advance in case anyone asks

Supported playlist formats are .wpl, .asx, and .wax.
Supported audio types are everything FMOD supports by default, .flac, .wav. aiff, and a bunch of old-school music formats, like .mid or .it files.

There are eight specific playlists the game recognizes, Underwater, City, Crafting, BossBattle, NightTime, and MainMenu. Hopefully these are somewhat self-explanatory in terms of when you might expect to hear them play.

So, anything in that playlist will be heard instead of the standard in-game ambient music (the general music you hear when running around in the world).

Each internal playlist can designate a primary and secondary playlist to look for. Most of the playlists will fall back to Ambient if they do not exist. This means that if you’d like to simply replace the majority of the music in the game

I have noticed in my time on this subreddit that there is a mindset that, and allows most people to skip over some very large problems with the game and how the community - especially the forum community - is run.

The fundamental flaw with this view of GW2 is that ANet is not a charity nor are they your friend; ANet is a business, and by providing free content that is interesting that are guaranteeing your continued use of the product and that you will tell your friends about this game, which will in turn increase sales.

You see, GW2 is making its profits through the credibility that free content updates provide. It is not as labor intensive as expansion packs, nor is it as far between, plus most of them require gems, which will always increase profits to a degree. Free content updates are going to net a profit for ANet or they would have been scrapped very soon after Halloween. 

What free content updates are not is a favor or charity. ArenaNet is not a parent and customers who complain are not ungrateful. When people complain about drop rates, what they are being is dissatisfied customers. They are saying ""This product that I paid for did not meet my expectations, please make it meet my expectations."" 

When the argument of ""but they give plenty of free content, they are the only real effective way to voice dissatisfaction to a company without asking for a refund or in some way retrieving your money after you purchased their product. A company needs to know when its customers are not happy, because unhappiness among a customer base has a tendency to spread.

So please, they are not privileges, they are products sold to customers, and while free content provided often is a very nice service, it should not buy credit with a community. It is not done for the benefit of the community first, but for the benefit of the bottom line; that is how a business is run and there is nothing inherently harmful about that mindset, but it is very simply how it works.

Hello my fellow explorers! I present to you my new Guild Wars 1 locations on the Guild Wars 2 map

- Based on the release map (previous one was based on beta)
- I've visited almost all locations in game and adjusted all locations accordingly
- Zone names are now on the map
- Bonus mission pack locations are now on the map
- Added some interesting points that have more behind them than meets the eye
- Higher resolution! More pixels! Oink!

To give you a rough idea how the map was made:

1.	Placed the Guild Wars 1 map on top of the Guild Wars 2 map ([example](http://redd.it/t86sv))
2.	Mark all outposts, dungeons and zone names
3.	Go through every zone on the wiki and mark possible points of interest
4.	Visit and verify all locations in Guild Wars 2 (Nicholas and Yakkington would be proud)
5.	Adjust the offset on some locations
6.	Do the last 3 steps again for Guild Wars 2 locations that could be in Guild Wars 1

I will post a long list of locations and how they have changed over time in a comment below. If you happen to find any errors or locations missing please don't hesitate to tell me.

Hi there

We thought it would be a good idea to provide some sort of way for redditors to meetup during the upcoming beta weekend

As it is the first beta weekend this is all very much a trial and error

------

**PvE**

The recommended area to meetup is **Cobiah's Column** which is located in **Lion's Arch**.

[[Map of the area]](http://i.imgur.com/lqUrZ.jpg)

The recommended servers are the following:


* **Darkhaven** (North America)
* **Whiteside Ridge** (Europe)
* **Sea of Sorrows** seems to be the unofficial Oceania server but it's worth considering that the majority of redditors will be on the two above servers. (Oceania)



If you gather there **on the hour** hopefully you'll find other redditors



------
**World vs World**

The World vs World meetup area is a little harder to plan because of the nature of the map but hopefully you all fight hard to keep your main keep under control!

The recommended area to meetup is the **main keep** which is located in **your home World vs World map**.

[[Map -- The coloured circles will be different

The recommended servers are the following:


* **Darkhaven** (North America)
* **Whiteside Ridge** (Europe)
* **Sea of Sorrows** seems to be the unofficial Oceania server but it's worth considering that the majority of redditors will be on the two above servers. (Oceania)


------

**Mass meetup**

Here's the opportunity for everyone on the server to meetup at the same time and take group screenshots/go explore.

As before meetup at **Cobiah's Column** which is located in **Lion's Arch**.

* Want a big skull for a shield? [Godskull Targe](http://dulfy.net/2013/01/11/gw2-shield-skins-gallery/#21) is a good choice.

* [Diamond Aegis](http://dulfy.net/2013/01/11/gw2-shield-skins-gallery/#11) has a similar model to the [GW1](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Diamond_Aegis) version.

* There are 3 variations of [Legionnaire Shield](http://dulfy.net/2013/01/11/gw2-shield-skins-gallery/#31), and ~~Ash legion~~ (Ash legion apparently just have a plain looking skin).

So after the soccer practise this morning we did The Battle for Claw Island. My son

It took awhile

When Tybalt talked the the main character for the last time I translated it to Swedish for him. I could see that he wasn't focused entirely on what I said, no doubt.

So when Tybalt walked into the courtyard and closed the gate behind him and said, my son asked:

""Where is he going?""

My eyes teared up.

So I told him. I told him about the sacrifice Tybalt made to save my sons characters and everybody else. And I told him why. I told him the tale of Lightbringer Tybalt Leftpaw.

And my sons eyes got watery...

He hugged me and he cried. Not a lot, not a real life friend""-amount. For the past years, ever since me and his mother got divorced, he's had trouble showing emotions when he is sad. He laughs, he laughs **a lot**. But when he is sad, he tries to hide it, tries to just ""take it"", I was proud and happy that he actually cried this time and made no attempt to hide it. So... thank you ArenaNet?

I decided it was enough GW2 for today

About one hour later we used YouTube to look at The Best of Tybalt

*Tybalt trying to pose as a pirate:*

**Lightbringer Tybalt Leftpaw:** Yarr and rarr and blimey, sailor!

**Jackdaw Jailer:** Who did you say you were again

**Lightbringer Tybalt Leftpaw:** I'm Two-Tibs A'whisker

*Tybalt disguise himself as a woman:*

**Lightbringer Tybalt Leftpaw:** Burn me

So even if there was a few tears and sadness

**For Lightbringer Tybalt Leftpaw! We will never forget you! Every Risen we'll kill from this day onward will die in your name!**

**PS:**
*My son knows what tool Treharne is, that basicly Tybalt had been replaced by Woody, he looked at me and said, ""seriously?"" I could almost touch his utter disappointment.*

*For the past days my son has been leveling his Ranger doing only the personal story. I don't know if he will do that the next time he'll log on, ""This wont end well"". Or lying downed, waiting for the main character to finish the job and ress him.*",[Spoiler],False,self,t5_2r9po,spo,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/1bsjh3/my_son_and_tybalt_part_2_spoiler/

Back pieces drop fairly often from Fractals of the Mists, but the rares can be put up for sell on the trading post, *and they're cheap.*

At least

* Cavalier's Spineguard - Power
* Magi's Spineguard - Healing
* Rabid Spineguard - Condition damage
* Soldier's Spineguard - Power
* Wayfarer's Spineguard - Magic Find

So if you need a back piece for cheap

1) Please do not run far ahead of the group.  Far too often have I seen the coordination in groups broken because some 1337 xXXSniperPornNOSC0PzXXx has decided he can handle a sub-boss by himself and complain when he is the first to die.  Also triggering events way before the rest of the team gets there is a good way to piss everyone off.

2) If you plan on skipping a particular part please make sure the rest of the group is on par with that.  There may be 2 people in your group who have never done this dungeon or done it your way.  I particularly hate skipping anything (for AC this includes skipping the first dungeon burrow, but if the rest of the group is in accordance I don't mind.  When you skip parts and don't communicate you murder your team when someone dies and has to run back through all of that.

3) Don't assume everyone is a veteran of a dungeon.  If there is even one person who has never done it

1352437045.0,12wdrv,Coriolis Plaza a hint at things to come?,Fritanga,383,79,58,"Today I was bored farming and playing through the game and was just wandering around Lion's Arch aimlessly. I happened to stumble into the area next to the central fountain (or what used to be the central fountain) and into Coriolis Plaza. 

As I looked around, but then I thought of the name ""Corialis"" and hit Wikipedia. As someone who has not done much in the study of Physics, most was confusing, but I found this blurb interesting:

""...in the 1651 Almagestum Novum

Drawing a line then through the fountain and understanding that as the deflection occurs that the precieved rotation of the object relative to the initial orientation occurrs

How does this give us some spoilers to the future of the game though? well, gates are located at 8, 10, 12, 2, and 5. There are islands that can easily support gates at the 7, 9, 1

The gates at Coriolis Plaza line up when the first gate on the left is the Norn gate (8 o'clock at Gate Hub Plaza) and then everything else rotated off that point. This gives us a possible preview of potentially new gates springing up in the future. If you go under the assumption that the first gate to the left in Coriolis Plaza is the Norn Gate, but instead is the one next to that gate. This could mean that there is even more potetial to expand to a new continent even.

What I got to thinking off this is as follows:

1) Coriolis Plaza is a preview of potentially more gates
2) The principal is off a shot fired from the south drifting east
3) Is this a hint at possible future racial cities?
4) Am I going insane and possibly have too much free time on my hands?

Special thanks to Redditor **Gariy** who gave his time and expertise in developing surveys to help make the Post-BWE 2 Survey even better. A big thank you goes out to everyone who gave feedback for improvements back in May.


The survey is **much longer** than the Brief Post-BWE Survey. Things to note:

* The long form questions are optional

* All other questions are required. This might be a bit clunky but it's due to some of the Google Survey platform limitations.

* Due to the platform limitations some of the more robust suggestions from the community couldn't be implemented. Sorry!

Most consumables are not useable in WvW and sPvP unless otherwise specified. **I will briefly describe their function and acquisition here and there are more detailed maps and info inside the links.**

Most consumable vendors are only unlocked after completing a small chain of events so don't expect to walk in and buy the stuff right away.

This anti-bot diminishing returns on loot has simply affected my play so much

The fact that this is pretty much the only bad thing I have to say about this game exemplifies to me the reason I dislike it so much. I love the game

Just remember when you make things illegal that criminals use

Please please please Anet remove this silly and completely counter-intuitive  mechanic so I can grind some mobs in peace. 

**edit: frontpage wtf.** I just want to reiterate that I love this game - this mechanic is just SO broken. To me it isn't even about farming, but I cannot farm a group of mobs for 10 hours if I want? 

I am **REALLY SORRY** to be another person complaining but I just wish the game did not punish me for playing how I like.

1348437062.0,10cz2v,The World vs. World Commander feature needs to be changed.,,422,126,195,"Sure

**The story**

It's 10am. I wake up, we'd lost everything except the Lowlands Keep overnight. Sure, no big deal, it always happens, and we took everything in our third of the map back.

Soon after I got on, we had the walls reinforced, the gate reinforced, mortars and a siegemaster in the grounds. I spent a lot of cash on it, though it wasn't just me that spent it. A lot of people on my server mailed me silver coins ('donated') so that I could grab these upgrades, including Fortified Towers and, at Lowland's Keep

In the meanwhile

Until twilight fell upon the real world

We have two commanders on the server as far as I know. Personally

I encountered one of them yesterday. He came over to the Eternal Battlegrounds and bawled out how his might World vs. World guild had taken over most of the Borderlands and how we weren't taking Stonemist. Note that said castle was so heavily fortified that our happy little force could not really take it. That's fine, and the momentum of this group became so colossal that all of a sudden we were steaming through towers and it was *great*. Well, until we started losing our upgraded towers that we had been leaving behind.

The second commander came around today and the same happened. A group of us, keeping the whole server updated about our towers, enemy movements, requesting support and siege weapons at defensive locations, were instantly thrown into the vacuum chamber as the sporadically-moving, silent guild zerg started going around the map, capturing locations and losing them when they moved on. We nearly lost Wildcreek Run, and Klovan Gully - as I'm told - due to the fact that our entire server was literally clinging to this commander.


**Why?**

Because when a commander comes along, unfortunately, that's not quite true. They seem to have no idea of tactical play, strategies etc, because they are the leaders of 'World vs. World' guilds.

This means they have a cult following wherever they go; zealots ready to lay their lives and gold on the line (as they have done to buy said person the Commander rank) to keep the zerg swarm moving. The lack of communication suddenly means that the largest force on the map - which is constantly growing - won't respond to the pleas of tower /keep defenders because they only agree on movements within guild chat. And then the hopeless of them defenders forces them to join the swarm just to stay alive.

As soon as a commander steps onto the field


**What can be done?**

I know people agree with me here

I've had people tell me ""You're the best Commander I've seen around here"" or ""Oh, communication, teamwork and expansion for objectives, and I believe in tactical moves, the use of supplies and upgrades bought from multiple people donating.

I firmly believe, they get Commander rank for 24/48 hours, or up to a week.

And what would happen to those with the Commander Manual? I don't know

There are 55 unique rifle skins in total

* [Glyphic Rifle](http://dulfy.net/2013/01/31/gw2-rifle-skins-gallery/#16) - White sparks runs through the rifle and parts of it turns a bit cloudy
* [Grinning Gourd Rifle](http://dulfy.net/2013/01/31/gw2-rifle-skins-gallery/#18) - Firefly like lights around the pumpkin head

* [The Predator](http://dulfy.net/2013/01/31/gw2-rifle-skins-gallery/#46) – envelopes the user with flames when drawn

**Interesting Rifles**

* [Charrzooka](http://dulfy.net/2013/01/31/gw2-rifle-skins-gallery/#7)- biggest weapon in game. The Hunter is probably the next largest. Because these rifles are so long

* [The Hunter](http://dulfy.net/2013/01/31/gw2-rifle-skins-gallery/#45) - This is one of the few legendary precursors with an unique model that isn't shared with a cheaper exotic. The model is also quite desirable. 

* [Vera](http://dulfy.net/2013/01/31/gw2-rifle-skins-gallery/#48) is a reference to the Vera weapon used by Jayne Cobb on Firefly

**If you think something should be added please post it below and I'll try to keep this post updated.**


*****


###When is Guild Wars 2 being released?
* August the 28th.
* August the 27th if you pre-order (more information below)
* August the 25th if you pre-purchase (more information below)

*****

	
###How do I access the beta?

* There are no more beta events before launch.


*****


###Will my beta character carry over to the game launch?

* No. All characters will be wiped from servers before launch.

*****
	
###What's the difference between pre-purchase and pre-order?

* A Guild Wars 2 **Pre-Purchase** involves buying the game in advance—that is, admittance to the game three days before release during the Headstart Access period, and the Hero's Band, a fantastic in-game item that provides a boost to your character in everything from power to critical damage. Those who pre-purchase the game will receive a Guild Wars 2 Pre-Purchase serial code from the seller. This code provides access to all the privileges listed above. The Guild Wars 2 Pre-Purchase is offered for the Digital, Digital Deluxe, and Collector's Editions of the game.
	
* A **Pre-Order** is a commitment to purchase Guild Wars 2 through an authorised retailer. Pre-ordering usually involves making a modest deposit. Those who pre-order Guild Wars 2 will be given a special serial code from their retailer that allows them one day of Headstart Access to the game.

*****

###Where can I pre-purchase/pre-order from?

* [Authorised retailers](https://buy.guildwars2.com/en/retailers)
	
*****

###How does physical Pre-Purchase work?

* Physical Pre-Purchase for Guild Wars 2 is only available at select retailers. The details of how this will work will differ slightly depending on which edition customers purchase and where they purchase it.
       * **Standard Edition (North America)**--Customers who pre-purchase the Guild Wars 2 Standard Edition will receive their Pre-Purchase serial code in different ways depending on where it was purchased.
        * **U.S. customers** will receive their Pre-Purchase serial code on a store receipt or in an email from the retailer.
        * **Canadian customers** will receive their Pre-Purchase serial code inside of the Standard Edition Pre-Purchase box.
        * **Customers in Australia and New Zealand** will receive their Pre-Purchase serial code on a Standard Edition Pre-Purchase card.

Every customer will then go to [https://register.guildwars2.com](https://register.guildwars2.com) and follow the on-screen instructions to create a Guild Wars 2 account and apply the Pre-Purchase serial code. This will give them access to Beta Weekend Events

When Guild Wars 2 launches

* **Standard Edition (Europe)**--Customers will buy the Standard Edition Pre-Purchase box and receive their serial code. This is the only serial code customers will receive and will grant access to the Beta Weekend Events, and full access to the final live game. Customers will not need to return to the retailer to receive another serial code.
	
* **Collector's Edition (North America and Europe)**--Customers will buy the Collector's Edition Pre-Purchase box and receive a Pre-Purchase serial code. They will then go to [https://register.guildwars2.com](https://register.guildwars2.com) and follow the on-screen instructions to create a Guild Wars 2 account and apply the serial code

*****

###Is my copy of Guild Wars 2 tied to my region?

Yes. To play from North America you must purchase a North American copy of the game. To play from Europe you must purchase a European copy of the game. Note that this restriction impacts where you can play from

By purchasing the correct copy of the game, using your local customer support team, and downloading the correct language support for your country.

*****

**Note:** Due to potential changes


*****


###Can I link with my Guild Wars 1 account if I choose not to link during registration?

* This email is only used as a username


*****

I've recently joined this subreddit and am blown away by the sheer amount of neverending blabbering about how bad recent patches are and how badly Arenanet is doing keeping GW2 alive. They are trying their best to answer to everyone's demands: making the game harder, make the game less grind-dependent, make the game more grind-dependent, ... A game is not drawing a circle: you can't do it perfectly. It's more like cooking dinner for ten friends: five will love it and five will hate it. At the same time, two different sorts of players will demand two different kind of games.

Of course, regarding Dragon Bash, I've seen over ten threads dealing with the exact same issue: 'I don't like it'. And all of those threads proceed to be upvoted by tons of people. We get it you do not like this update.

This place should be a subreddit where we deal with all the problems once and PROVIDE A VALUABLE ALTERNATIVE. This is so very, fun and reward.

I for one love the new update. An exciting minigame, and some damn cool rewards. Those holographic wings? Awesome! The Jade skins? Unbelievably cool! The free minis you all got if you bought some gems? Cool beans! Some of the items are supposed to be hard to get. If you'd get them right away, you would leave the game in a day and come back for the next update. Try to develop a feel of acomplishement when you finally got that greatsword skin, or that rare mini.

You can very easily downvote this into the ground. You don't agree with me because you think the event sucks monkeyballs. But that won't help you any further. What needs to happen is this subreddit becoming a friendly

Thank you and have a splendid day.

**EDIT:**

I feel like I’m forced to make an update to this thread. I’ve got a lot of response and I’ll try my best to give my opinion to a majority of those. In advance sorry if my tone becomes a little less formal as a lot of you guys don’t seem hold back using insults and accusations in yours. I feel deeply depressed as the Reddiquette does not appear to apply here. I have never meant to hurt anyone and simply stated my opinion on current matters

First of all, I clearly said that I encourage you guys telling the devs where it’s at. The only complaint I had was that those complaints are often ill-stated and just a blatant insult in the face of Arenanet. In the past days, all threads seemed to have gotten a ton of negative replies in relation to the Dragon Bash patch. THAT’S GOOD. It’s very good. By expressing your experiences with the patches, the devs know that you didn’t like it and are more likely to change things in the future. Now my post was to urge you all to take the second step: building up your criticism with a series of arguments and ways you’d like to see it evolve. You can bend it any way you want, but what would you like to read more as a dev: “This patch is shit.” Or “This patch is shit because the lore underlying the patch seems far-fetched and childish. In the future I would like to see lore that involves an active threat to Tyria where the main characters of the game need aid with their efforts to stop the evil”? To sum this part up: I don’t discourage negative posts, I cheer upon them, but try to put more meaning into it.

Secondly, unnecessary and irrelevant to the post. I can assure you I am not a ‘fanboy’. I do have my complaints about the game just like anybody else. The storyline was too short, the multitude of dungeons too small and the random events in maps are not as ‘spontaneous’ as promised. I do have these complaints, but as I have no real alternative except the obvious: adding more content (what the devs are said to be doing), I don’t feel the need to state it. Again: I am not just a fanboy, I am someone who feels empathy with a company who’s trying to give two sorts of players everything they want. As opposed to some people who feel like they have a magic wand that makes the devs create content to their needs as a magic genie.

To end, and I care about the people that share that same sentiment. And if it maybe caused one person to think and go ‘maybe I should tell them why I don’t like this patch’, then I’ll be a happy man.

I only posted this with good intentions and hope to see you guys on some other thread someday!

Yours sincerely

I have to be honest though, please just comment as you would normally! 

With the [last](http://jeffufu.deviantart.com/art/Guild-Wars-2-Fanart-Jackalope-Field-Trip-328928302) painting I had a golem chasing a jackalope. That set my mind off for the next little while

Thanks for being awesome everyone. I hope you like this painting.

And a quick also-cool thing that happened today. I blog about every month or so on my website, just stuff in general.

**Full Guide here**:http://dulfy.net/2012/10/03/gw2-endgame-gearing-guide/

The guide is fairly lengthy and and to reduce the amount of vertical scrolling

That said

* TP still lacks basic filter functionality (can't filter light/medium/heavy or backpieces
* Guild management is worse than many contemporary MMOs: can't see last played, only a small space for messages from leadership to the members, and guild members have to check to see if it changes because the game doesn't tell you if it does. We have heard recently that guild management is not a priority and will not get fixed soon, which I find really disappointing, considering the sorry state it's been in for the entire life of the game. Guild Missions are nice but that exacerbates the problem of lacking a calendar. Additionally, the Guild Mission UI does not update for guesting players, would be nice if it did. Same goes for the WvW UI when guesting
* Clipping on many kinds of armor has gone unfixed. Weapons often clip through the ground and while sheathed (with hair/armor), but ignored other, older helms doing this, which I find silly. It proves that if they really want to they can fix the helm facial hair clipping but have decided for whatever reason not to. And Charr armor is horrific in most instances, but you can go see [u/Charrikayu's](http://www.reddit.com/user/Charrikayu) [excellent post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/1isd48/i_want_to_share_the_agony_of_charr_armor_and_how/) on that.
* Achievement UI got a revamp, especially when these Living Story events, worth ~150 points, tend to gravitate toward PvE. Devon Carver (WvW dev) has acknowledged this issue for months now but we haven't seen any changes.
* Person opening the dungeon leaving/getting kicked results in the entire party getting kicked out of the dungeon. It doesn't happen too often but when it does it's extremely frustrating that one person can hold your party hostage. Yeah
* The chat often culls all player chat when you drop party or zone. Would it be so hard to preserve the chat until some maximum volume of text is reached?
* Items don't stack properly when you double click them from your inventory to insert them into the bank or vice versa. You have to drag them manually to avoid creating two stacks of items. It's the last thing on my list because yes I have gotten accustomed to dragging the items but really

TL;DR Guild Wars 2 lacks polish in a lot of areas. They seem able to push out content at unprecedented rates (what we are getting every 2 weeks is amazing) but frankly,False,self,t5_2r9po,1374528243.0,dis,,t3_1iu7ss

1357131694.0,15tnyo,"For all the recent complaints about RNG, farming gold, and progression to end-game items",Serang,450,288, seem to depict a guild wars 2 where farming gold is ridiculously slow, I'll just drop an easy way for even casual gamers to obtain a good amount of gold everyday.

**Easy way for even Casual Gamers to make gold**

Running CoF path 1 takes me(with groups found on gw2lfg.com) an average of 10-14 minutes to finish. 
That being said

1. Slave Driver -- 14 silver(with omnomberry bar) + bag of wonderous goods
2. Acolyte/Saving Crea -- Chest + 10 silver + bag of wonderous goods
3. Opening the gate -- Chest
4. Legendary Effigy -- 21 silver + Chest
5. Finishing the Dungeon -- 26 silver + 60 Dungeon Tokens

You can use the dungeon tokens to buy lvl 70 rares in LA for 30 tokens each and you can salvage those rares for ectos to sell as well. 
Assuming .9 Ectos per Rare

2 x .9 x 26 silver(price of ecto) = 47 silver

3 bags of wonderous goods you get 3 bag of coins and 9 dungeon tokens total. Since 30 tokens = a rare
9/30 x .9 x 26 = 7 silver
Average gold received from bag of coins is about 4 silver so 3 x 4 = 12 silver.

Added all up: 14 + 10 + 21 + 26 + 12 + 7 + 47 – 3(price of omnomberry bar) = 1.34 Gold.

There. **You've made 1.34 gold in 15 minutes.** No exploits
15 minutes a day for 1.34 gold. You can spend the rest of your time online enjoying other content
Onto the topics 

**RNG**

People complain a lot about RNG because they seem to think that RNG is the **main** source of income generator. Viewing RNG as the main source of income is flawed and of course people are going to be mad if they see it this way. You wouldn’t make playing the lottery your day job because it isn’t stable. People seem to latch on to the idea that fast money can only come from RNG which inherently favor bots because it is a numbers game. However

**Playing the TP**

If you played the Trading Post for your wealth good for you, but an increase that’s larger than 15 percent. If someone has a program or the ability to obtain 15+ percent returns then they should stop wasting their time with guild wars and play the stock market instead because that’s pretty incredible.  They also deserve it because when they play the TP there’s the risk of losing your money entirely. There’s no risk in farming. Higher risk =higher reward

**Value of Gold**

Despite what everybody says, and etc.  Price reflects supply and demand and because Charged Lodestone is used in so many popular legendaries of course its price is going to go up. Other lodestones which used to be 1-2 gold are all now below 1 gold.(with the exception of Onyx). That being said, I think because of its high demand, Charged Lodestone drops should be modified but that’s a drop rate issue 

**Gold buying**

This is everyone’s biggest gripe. Is it unfair? Yes. Was it possible for ANet to completely stop gold buying within the first couple months of release whilst worrying about other things like gameplay and bugs? No. That being said

TL  ; DR calm down

**Edit 1: ""Why can't i get _____ by just playing the game""""**

The reason it takes a much longer amount of time to get gold by ""Just playing the game"" such as map events, veterans, champions, and etc instead of dungeons is because **Dungeons are the hardest widely available option in PvE.** If you really stop to think about it, all those other ways of ""just playing the game"" are much easier than dungeons. **Reward scales with difficulty** and people seem to forget that dungeons are the hardest. Why? Because group/map events, veterans, and champions can be zerged down by groups of 10+ people easily and with very little effort. It's not very hard to afk auto-attack a big boss/event.  For example, you could just stand near the cannons and afk range the elementals who spawn. Dungeons contain really difficult monsters/bosses

So you can enjoy the game all you want but your reward will be compensated by the difficulty of the thing you're doing.  

**Charged Lodestones**

One of the comments below from workacct99762 was very insighful so i'm just going to copy paste it here i hope he doesnt mind!
the sell price/sell volume/buy volume moving averages for Charged Lodestones approximately double from 1.71g/178.5/955.9 on Oct 27 to 3.72g/599/3584.4 yesterday (Jan 1). Compare that with Crystal Lodestones which went from 1.37g/115.2/373 to 0.8g/519.7/1217.
Add in the fact that early/mid October is when the Foefire weapons and Mjolnir got their wiki pages (indicating the start of a general awareness of what is required for them) and it's perfectly reasonable that Charged Lodestones are now more expensive
Even more telling
So if people are manipulating the markets on these items

To add to that, is not a very easy, and thus popular, dungeon. Therefore, it's harder to obtain Charged Lodestones in comparison to, let's say, Molten/Glacial Lodestones because the dungeons that drop these (CoF and HotW) are much easier and more popular than Crucible. This coupled with more popular legendaries requiring Charged creates the elevated price

[As mysteryoeuf pointed out](http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/t1pb4/the_brief_postbwe_survey_results_are_in/c4iwrch) there are potential repeats in the data that sully it up a bit. I haven't played a lot with the google doc tools to try and correct for any of that

**Graphs of the data collected:**

* **[Profession and Race Choices](http://i.imgur.com/WCgwl.png)**

There seems to be a pretty good spread across the profession choices within our Reddit GW2 community. Elementalist is clearly favored with 14% of the response set with Guardian/Warrior trailing not far behind at 11%. Engineer and Necro came in last at 8%. However

I was surprised with the high numbers of Asura and Sylvari but I believe there is some bias there are people are most likely psyched to try them out but haven't been able to do so yet. Once they are tested I think things like animations and other aesthetic factors may play into whether or not people truly hold on to them as race choices.

* **[Hours and Activities](http://i.imgur.com/H6wLy.png)**

The hours played item was woefully broken because I failed to diversify the top end. It looks completely skewed for that reason. I will fix that in the next survey as well.

Not surprisingly

* **[Activities \(repeat\) and Age](http://i.imgur.com/unYhL.png)**

The age breakdown seems typical of what (I imagined

* **[Gender Expression

90% Male. 7% Female

""Did the BWE change your mind?"" Was a poorly designed afterthought. The question was put in rather early (134 participants did not have access to it but if you look at the raw data you will see that people have chosen a main profession but also selected that they ""can't make up [their] mind."" So the data here is really iffy. Next time the question will be ordered appropriately among the rest of the questions and will be worded differently to strengthen it.

1332637823.0,rc41r,Initial thoughts on the state of GW2,gw2awaythrow,372,99,188,"First

* **PvE**

My thoughts are similar to the ""burned out after 1 day"", and honestly it should be; if I wanted to play Dark Souls, I would play Dark Souls. 

The problem is that PvE is more mindless than in any other big ticket MMO. In WoW, questing is really easy, just like it is in GW2, the difference is that in those other games there are resources to manage, procs to be on the lookout for, spells to be on the lookout to interrupt, etc. Sure, but at least it's there; it's something to focus on--something to optimize and become better at.

In GW2 while questing, but almost universally the reward for setting up these combos is non-existent and spamming your moves is probably 95% as effective as perfect play.

Dodging isn't super revolutionary

* **Structured PvP**

It's really nice to be able to get a maxed out character 10 minutes in and play around with it to see if this is the class for you. The battlegrounds are really well done

* **World PvP**

Something is busted about it atm, smaller skirmishes between smaller groups breaking out constantly in other places. The hype here is well-deserved; it's going to be incredible and probably worth your 60 dollars by itself.

* **Performance**

Needs a lot of work. On systems capable of getting 40+ FPS almost everywhere in Skyrim (60 indoors), performance seems to be much better in structured PvP (smaller area I guess), but in structured PvP maps I seem to get 30-40 FPS regularly, which is acceptable.

I know ""it's only beta!"", but I'm finding that on average my FPS is in the teens or low 20's. The one saving grace is that even at 20 FPS it's surprisingly ""smooth"", spinning around rarely causes ""catches"". I would argue that a game that runs at 60 FPS a lot of the time and drops to 20 when you start turning is a lot worse than a game that runs at 30 FPS most of the time and only drops to 25 when turning. Still, this needs a lot of work; hopefully there are further optimizations to be made and driver updates which will squeeze out a few more percentage points of performance.

* **Aesthetics**

If anything, whereas in other MMOs often towns feel like they were placed there just to facilitate repairs/auction houses. GW2 towns feel like you are just a traveler visiting a vibrant city that is going about its day--it's really well done. Simply put, the environments are stunning.

* **Hopes**

This game as it exists now is probably worth 60 bucks considering there's no subscription. The PvP is really good. My hopes are that ANet decreases the effectiveness of button mashing and increases the effectiveness of skillful use of cooldowns. Make button mashing 50% as effective as perfect setups as opposed to 90% as effective. Also, and again this is on a system that is more than capable of playing Skyrim with tons of eye candy.

This post comes off a little bit more derisive than I meant it to be. This is a great game, but I feel like with all the one-sided ""this is what's terrible about the game"" posts being made in this sub-reddit that I should at least try and offer the game a fair shake.

**TL;DR:** The game is beautiful, and solo PvE needs to be tweaked such that skillful use of skills is actually worth doing because right now it's a mindless button mash with nothing worth paying attention to.

There's a lot of excitement in the air and the hype seems to reach new levels every week. This easily leads to people forgetting that nothing is perfect and if we're going to help ArenaNet while participating in the Beta events we need to remove our fanboy/fangirl glasses and start thinking critically.

This will hopefully also help cool down some of the ""over-hype"" that inevitably leads to disappointment.

I mention a few of the **potential** flaws below to start the discussion going

**REMINDER: Do not downvote based on opinion!** If you don't agree with a certain flaw then **explain why** and try to convince the rest of us to see it your way instead.

* **""Revolutionary"" quest system** A lot of focus has been put when advertising Guild Wars 2 on how unique the questing system is and how it's going to change how people play MMO's. My worry is that this turns out to be simply a new ""look"" on an old system. The hearts can easily be compared with traditional quests where the quest giver is located in the vicinity of the quest. Several other games do this. Dynamic events can also be compared with repeatable/daily quests with the only difference that the quests vary from time to time. How this turns out all depends on the implementation of the systems and how they truly integrate in the game world. Which leads me the second point:
* **Dynamic events in the long run** One of the things that no videos of previous betas can truly show us is how the rotation and frequency of DE's will work in the long run. Will the novelty wear off? Will it feel like ""oh
* **Meta-game cookie cutter builds** For those who don't know what this is, comes up with as ""*the* build"" that everyone should play as it's superior to any other builds. GW1 has this, WoW has this, most games have some sort of other of meta-game ""optimals"". Will GW2 have them? Will there be a specific combination of weapons, utility skills and traits that are far superior to other combinations for the same profession? If there is then the diversity between players that ArenaNet advertises will not be seen.
* **Messy, 'spammy' combat rotations, messy visuals, etc. And a lot of these complaints have been claimed ""fixed"" or ""you're not playing it right"". But I still think this is worth looking into **very** closely when we get our hands on the game. The combat is essential that it feels fun and fluid, so no matter what people claim I still feel there is room for scepticism and concern on such a crucial mechanic.
* **Lackluster personal story** GW1 was almost entirely about the story, will it feel as important and epic as it felt in GW1? Will it feel detached from the ""real world"" considering it's entirely instanced and based on your choices?
* **""End game""** No matter how often ArenaNet says ""there is no end game"" or ""the entire game is end game"" I still think this is something worth discussing. I feel that every MMO needs some sort of progression outside the character itself, there were many things the player could do once they finished the campaigns. The Underworld, the Fissure of Woe, Domain of Anguish, EoTN Dungeons, etc. All of it could be classified as end game. In GW2 however, ArenaNet responds the claims of ""no raids"" or ""~~no end game dungeons~~"" with ""you can always go back and finish DE's in older areas"". Will this be enough? Wouldn't this make you feel like you went from the one who fought against Zhaitan to a farmers apprentice fending off farm vermin? We'll have to see.

1373563349.0,1i3c6e,Could the Zephyrites and Glint be connected?,TsukasaK,318,48,120,"Greetings reddit

After spending a few days with the new patch and reading various topics here i've noticed something that could be a link between the Zephyrite Aspects and Glint.

For GW1 players, Nature, Chaos, Darkness, Elements and strength, which all took the form of a dragon, before we faced Glint herself

This alone wasn't enough to draw a conclusion, but simpley forces of nature (This we already knew), but she also talks about Glint, and seems to place a lot of respect and emphasis into Glint whenever she is mentioned, I found it strange that a group living in the sky would know of Glint specificly, but even stranger that they seemed to speak of her in such high regard.

Now today I came across this reddit thread with the whole “Zephyrite song” recorded In game.

http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/1i2mdu/i_became_obsessed_with_the_zephyrite_song_so_i/

In the song they appear to be mourning the loss of something

“She flies no more in glinting beam and leaves a hollow hole”

Specificly refers to the being in question as female and a subtle hint with the word ""Glinting""

“Alas

Most likely refering to [Edge of destiny spoilers](#s ""Glint's death at the end of Edge of Destiny

“The clouds shed tears upon the land for the loss of our Crystal Sun”

This makes it sound like Glint was a core part of the Zephyrite “Religion”

“Alas Alas how time must pass. Ancient
 
“So terrible

Refering to this being as ""Ancient"" seems to fit Glint perfectly so far.

Now the rest I haven't seen myself in game

“Generations prior to the rise of Orr, humans discovered the three Aspects and decided to construct Zephyr Sanctum as a safe haven from influences of the outside world and dedicate themselves to the aspects.”  

http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Zephyrite

This alone sound's like nothing major

http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Brotherhood_of_the_Dragon 

This brotherhood being a Dwarven group with a connection to Glint as the Vision of Glint could be summoned in Droknars forge from their Shrine. (We also recieved a cloth of the Brotherhood in GW1 for completing the Glint challenge in EOTN)

Trying to put all this together

This would mean that the Zephyrite are the modern day version of the Brotherhood of the Dragon

It would also explain why they hold her in such high regard as to refer to her as their ""Crystal Sun"" if she was infact the ""Elder"" who founded the order with the dwarves centuries ago

Maybe i'm seeing links where there are none

Sorry for any formatting errors / spoilers not being hidden etc

1363724949.0,1am62r,A preview of the Guild Rush missions,dulfy,314,49,90,"Hey everyone

**The Basics**

To unlock Guild Rushes

There are 6 Guild Rushes we have found so far. I think that is all the Guild Rush that are available at the moment. In each guild rush, and 50 silver. 

The easiest way to do them is to have non-transformed players (I call them escorts) clear the way of hostile creatures and then transformed players just have traps to deal with. For me personally

**Guild Rush videos**

I do have videos of each Guild Rush course up you can watch to get a waste of what each course is like. I will list each course here in terms of fun factor (personal preference

* [Spider Scurry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5x4J9mC3XI) - I really like this one even if the army of dredge camped here can be annoying at times. You are like a tiny ""spiderman"" and can leap from plank to plank using webs. You can go anywhere you want - horizontal

* [Crab Scuttle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtVEM92-BF8) - Do you enjoy longwalks on the beach? What about longwalks in the beach in crab form while chased by suicidal karkas and angry reef drakes? 

* [Ghost Wolf Run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQZogmndTI) - This one is particularly enjoyable since I can leap long distances in wolf form and the scenery is quite nice (waterfalls)

* [Chicken Run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_o5r-raRyc) - It is always fun when you get turned into a chicken and must escape nasty harpies and bandits. 

* [Bear Lope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H57v-NItzns) You get turned into a cute bear cub but must journey through a nasty cavern filled with bats, grawls, fleshreavers, and imps. 

* [Devourer Burrow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KasSzq-BmA) Become a devourer and trek through a spider cavern filled with spiders and some of the most annoying traps. 

**Guild Rush guide**

I do have a more detailed guide in written format explaining some of the stuff in more detail but most of the guild rush courses are fairly self explanatory and you don't need to read a guide on it.

1347844390.0,zzz80,Colin Johanson on the Difficulty of Dungeons,ominanon,316,52,396,"I was looking at the Forums when I happened across this wall of text from Colin Johanson.  It's worth the read though

As a GW1 player

(This first paragraph is him quoting someone else in the forum post)
&gt; “What I would call ‘hard’ was trying to run Domain of Anguish and Mallyx with a balanced setup in the first weeks it was released. Many people called it impossible

&gt; I’ll point out ironically, there was no tactics to defeat DoA”, etc. I went back and read through the original DoA launch feedback and it was literally identical to the comments folks on the forums are leaving now.
We made the choice back then to stick with the difficulty

&gt; We’ll be doing the same with the Gw2 explorable dungeons, strong use of cross-profession combos, use of cooking/consumable buffs (these make a huge difference!) and well formed player tactics. By comparison, after having months to play the game and the time our alpha was complete, some of our better dungeon groups felt the explorable dungeons were too easy for launch, we decided not to make them any harder given the expected player skill on launch.
We’re actively monitoring every dungeon and working on balancing issues we encounter appropriately. We’ll be keeping an eye on bosses we think don’t have enough varied mechanics to warrant their large health pools and updating them over time to make them more varied/interesting fights. We’ll be monitoring

&gt; All of that being said, the explorable dungeons can all be overcome by being skilled groups. We’ve seen many groups do it just fine in our internal alpha test once they had time to learn how to play the game well. Just like Domain of Anguish in Gw1, it takes time and practice to learn how to overcome stuff as hard as our explorable mode dungeons, and that’s exactly the kind of players they are designed for.
If DoA was any indication

1359231909.0,17bx95,"Guild Wars 2 Outfitter - Create, Share, &amp; Rate! | A Community Website Idea",_aeryxia,315,60, I was unsatisfied with just being able to preview items in the clunky PvP Locker interface and wished there were a better solution for putting together outfits and such. I know there are some other sites out there that have static pictures of armor sets on different races/professions

http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4Da3uqUHh54/UQNJvhGQLpI/AAAAAAAAATc/qkxbwoGWro0/s1600/gw2_outfitter_finished_view.jpg

I decided to design an idea mockup of sorts that showed exactly what I had in mind for this site - the result is **Guild Wars 2 Outfitter**! This site would allow users to create custom outfits and then share them easily with the community.

Features would include:

* Sample model and armor/weapon previews in 3D
* Instantly filter results
* Outfit Mode and Dye Mode
* Shopping List with real-time info pulled from the Trading Post
* Account features
* Easily browse outfits created by others

For more information

Guild Wars 2 is a really cosmetic game and there is such an importance placed on upgrading the visual appeal of your character that I think the community really needs a site like this to exist. The only problem is that even though I have the idea and drive to make it

So if anyone would be interested in working on this project with me
Or just general thoughts about this idea would be great,False,self,t5_2r9po,1360570317.0,,SylvariE,t3_17bx95
