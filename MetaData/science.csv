Recently, non-incendiary responses to the tired, overused arguments, and a number of the evangelist's friends have begun supporting him in his arguments. We've had to deal with claims such as ""theories are just ideas created by bored scientists,"" etc. Yes, I realize that this is, in many ways, but I'm a sucker for a good debate.

Despite all of their absolutely crazy beliefs, when they began resorting to anti-intellectualism to try to tear us down. One young woman asked us ""Do you have any Grey Poupon?"" despite the both of us being fairly casual, laid back types. We're being accused of using ""big words"" to create arguments that don't mean anything to make them look stupid, yet, looking back on my word choices, I've used nothing at above a 10th grade reading level. ""Inherent"" and ""intellectual"" are quite literally as advanced as the vocabulary gets.

Despite how dangerous and negative a force religion can be in the world, even in the light of calm, rational, well-reasoned arguments.

1) How do I get into grad school? 
A: It's not all a numbers game -- do as much research as you can for the experience in a lab

2) What are you doing next with this technology? 
A: To continue my quest in making science feel more like a friendship-filled hobby and less like a job by asking the questions that really can excite and benefit a community. Next on my plate is neuropsychiatric disorders and how to alleviate certain symptoms by tinkering with any associated memories.

3) How do I find the right lab to work in? 
A: It's like a relationship: There are three planets that need to align for grad school to be a success -- you have to love the person you're with (the lab head), and you have to love the people in the lab (the significant other's friends). So many people are willing to sacrifice one of these and, in doing so, the entire edifice goes kaboom. Don't settle for anything less than all of the above, and never do it for just the money. It's that feeling of discovering something no one else in history has ever seen that money itself can never buy.

Hi r/science!

We have some pretty exciting news to share with you. As many of you know

In the interest of full transparency, and thus will not be allowed to submit any stories under these usernames. Their goal is simply to discuss science topics they love as much as you do. In fact, u/Mackinstyle [Mod] summed it up best in our chat, stating: *""It's just important that we preserve the democratic process in which reddit operates. But we are thrilled to have you guys keeping an eye out and sharing your expertise and insight to help steer the comments in a positive direction.""*

However you may be wondering, stating their credentials, will ensure that the answers to your questions are coming from someone with an vetted background in the subject. It will also give you guys an opportunity to ask about how science is written in the media and to explore details of a published experiment not explicitly stated in a NatGeo article.  

With that said, currently, is entirely comment-driven, and will not include any special permissions when it comes to National Geographic submissions. 

Finally
