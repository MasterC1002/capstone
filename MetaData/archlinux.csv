I've been an on-off Linux user for about 15 years now

For the past couple of years I've been dual booting Ubuntu and Windows. I've also tried Debian.
Ubuntu is a great distro, trying to resolve dependencies on my own using software magazine cover CDs!). However, it feels so bloated, and any problems I had were fixed by trawling forums and copying commands verbatim, I had very little clue as to how the system worked.
Whilst waiting ages for Windows to shut down after accidentally booting into it (I realised this was the only reason I ever booted Windows) and then booting into Ubuntu (which whilst faster still feels pretty slow) I remembered my Slackware days where I could be at a command prompt within a minute

I briefly considered trying Slackware again

After a but of research I discovered Arch. It sounded like the distro I've been looking for, booted gparted and partitioned my drive ready for my glorious single boot Arch.

The learning started there

The installation itself was pretty straightforward when following the Beginners Guide, I understood what each of them did. I learned about backgrounding Daemons, learned so much.

After the install I realised that I was going to have to spend some time getting my Broadcom wireless working (had to do this in Debian and older Ubuntu releases)
Now, no post it note applets, not even a display manager. I ran the top command and almost wet myself. 

I'm sure you get posts like this all the time from excited new users

1366717984.0,1cxhqj,Multiseat Gaming Guide,dardyfella,98,12,16,"Late one night I had an idea to run a gaming-capable multiseat setup. Ever since then I've been looking around for a solution and I found three possible solutions:

* https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=105450
* https://github.com/fenghaitao/xserver-with-gl-accelerated-xephyr
* Multiseat with 2 or more graphics cards

I was unsatisfied with the hackish nature of using multiple X pointers and I was unable to get it working properly anyway whilst the OpenGL accelerated Xephyr fork was 3 years old and buying a second graphics card was out of the question. I was about to give up until I stumbled across another possible solution - Xephyr with VirtualGL.

For those new to multiseating, spawns a child X server within a parent X server. You can attach a physical keyboard and mouse to it and those inputs will be locked to the Xephyr X server. Xephyr is your standard solution when it comes to multiseating - it's been around for a while. Xephyr however doesn't support hardware-accelerated OpenGL much to my dismay.

Enter VirtualGL.

In short

I've tested it with both native Quake 3 (ioquake3-git - ioquake3 wouldn't compile properly for me) and Warcraft 3 launched with WINE. The framerates seem ok and there aren't any input issues as long as you tie physical keyboards/mice to the Xephyr X servers. Scrots are below:

http://imgur.com/He05tHz,VTcv62I

Enough of my yapping - here's the guide to setting this up.


NOTE: Chances are you will need a beefy PC for this to work. Here are the specs of the PC I used to test the games: 

* Intel Core i7-3820
* ASUS P9X79
* 1 x AMD 7970
* 32GB of RAM
* 1 x SSD
* 1 x Monitor

NOTE: I'm going to assume you are running Arch Linux and you know what X is and how to install packages and install from PKGBUILDs. All packages listed here (with the exception of TurboVNC and AMD Catalyst drivers) are available from the Arch Linux repositories. I'm not going to go into detail with setting up WINE for Warcraft 3 because the information is already out there.

NOTE: You'll need N+1 keyboards and N+1 mice where N is the number of seats. The extra one keyboard and mouse is for managing the primary X server so you can start Xephyr servers and launch X applications. You can follow this guide if you only have one monitor - it'll just get a little cramped.

Step 1:Install a graphics driver if you don't have one installed already. NVIDIA users - I don't know what the best driver is for 3D performance but I'm going to guess it'll be the proprietary one. AMD users - install either catalyst-total if you've got a card older than the 7xxx series or install catalyst-test if you have one of the newer 7xxx series cards. Intel users - I have no idea if this will even be worth the time for you but you can always give it a go. 7xxx users may also have to downgrade their xf86-input-evdev and xorg-server packages to accommodate catalyst-test.

Step 2: Setup your X config (I used aticonfig --initial to generate my xorg.conf - I don't know what you NVIDIA users do). It doesn't need to be too fancy just as long as X uses our graphics driver we installed from step 1. Install mesa-demos and run glxgears or launch a 3D game to be sure that your X server has hardware acceleration.

Step 3: Install the following packages:
If you have a 32-bit Arch Linux installation:

    pacman -S xorg-server-xephyr virtualgl

If you have a 64-bit Arch Linux installation:

    pacman -S xorg-server-xephyr virtualgl lib32-virtualgl

Step 4: Run 'vglserver_config' as root. Follow the answers.

    Press 1 to Configure server for use with VirtualGL
    Answer 'Yes' to Restrict 3D X server access to vglusers group (recommended)?
    Answer 'Yes' to Restrict framebuffer device access to vglusers group (recommended)?
    Answer 'Yes' to Disable XTEST extension (recommended)?
    Press X to Exit.

Step 5: Add the user you log into X with into the vglusers group.

    usermod -aG vglusers USERNAME

Step 6: Logout

Step 7: Launch N+1 terminals.

Step 8: Now launch Xephyr N times

    sudo Xephyr -ac -br -noreset -screen 1024x768 :1 -mouse evdev,device=/dev/input/by-id/USB-MOUSE-1 -keybd evdev,,,device=/dev/input/by-id/USB-KEYBOARD-1

    sudo Xephyr -ac -br -noreset -screen 1024x768 :2 -mouse evdev,device=/dev/input/by-id/USB-MOUSE-2 -keybd evdev,,,device=/dev/input/by-id/USB-KEYBOARD-2

You'll want to select the USB mouse devices that have 'event-mouse' at the end of the device id.

Running the commands with sudo is necessary because we need to rights to gain access to the USB devices however we still need rights to launch X-based programs within our primary or parent X server. We must also increment the display option or display identifier (:1


After running these two commands you should see two black windows appear. You won't be able to use the keyboard and mouse just yet - we've got to launch an X application within our Xephyr servers.

Step 9: Paste the following text into our spare terminal and press enter:

    DISPLAY="":1""

Doing this modifies the display variable which allows us to launch a X application underneath a different X server - in this case one of our Xephyr servers. To launch X applications in another Xephyr session

Step 10: Launch an X application within our spare terminal.
You can launch just about anything here - a window manager

Step 11: Launch a 3D application.
You can either do this step from inside the Xephyr server or from our spare terminal in our primary X server. To do so you must prefix the command for the 3D application with 'vglrun'. For example:

    vglrun glxgears

    vglrun quake3

    vglrun wine Frozen\ Throne.exe

Step 12: Congratulations or it didn't work and OP sucks.
It either worked for you or it didn't. If it didn't work for you try something simple like vglrun glxgears inside your primary X server and then inside one of the Xephyr servers and see if that works and then move up to a native 3D game like Quake 3 and if you really get stuck you should make a post and I'll try and guide you through it. Finally: a funny fact about this guide: I had more trouble installing Arch Linux with a UEFI boot loader than I did getting gaming-capable multiseat working.

The next update to this guide (if I don't lose my mind trying to understand the black magic that is Sound on Linux) will be sorting out sound and have sound from each Xephyr server come out on separate audio jacks on one audio device/card (if such a thing is even possible) or separate audio devices/cards (much more plausible). Exploring TurboVNC and the possibilities it brings is also something I want to do.",,t5_2qrzu,1366731708.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/1cxhqj/multiseat_gaming_guide/

Now my PC is a now ageing Vaio laptop and the switch to Unity made my laptop run extremely slow. That combined with the fact that I really didn't like it meant I was going to have to abandon my distro of choice.  

I made the switch to Mint as it still used ubuntu and had kept gnome 2. All was well until Mint 12 and the dawn of gnome 3

So ANOTHER distro was needed

After the shock of no restricted drivers installer, the stable build of debian is now getting rather long in the tooth, there was a coupe of programs that I simply couldn't install as there were too many out of date dependencies.

So I went looking for yet another distribution

I was going to so a fresh install of Arch from scratch. This may be trivial to some people but to me it seemed like climbing a mountain. I'd have to set up EVERYTHING. 

Well that was four days ago, brightness finally works! (This was the one thing that confused me the most the wiki was actually more confusing than helpful on this.)

I can honestly say I've learnt more in the last four days setting up my arch install than using ubuntu for four years. I' not detracting from Ubuntu here for an absolute begginer who just wants their computer to work with no fuss it's still great. 

I have a new found confidence in using my linux system

I'll stop rambling now and just say

A large part of the systemd thing is that making an init system is a lot of work.  Eight years ago Arch only had 15 volunteers.  Now we have 60, we will probably let them.

But here is the thing - a big part of Arch is that everything should be supported and switching subsystems should be easy.  Look at switching logins, ALSA and Pulse.

If someone maintains it, get other people using it, become a TU, make it an official package.  If a dev really likes your work, you might be able to skip those last few steps.

&gt; **If your current password was created with shadow version prior to 4.1.4.3-3 (2011-11-26) you are using MD5. To start using a SHA-512 hash you just need to change your password with passwd.**


A quick look at *my personal* '**/etc/shadow**' file showed I was using MD5 hashes

    sudo passwd &lt;user&gt;

and specifying my same password truly updated the '**/etc/shadow**' file entry to a SHA-512 hash. (FYI: only reason I ran '**sudo**' above was so I could specify the *same password*



sooo, I just am not seeing it other then on the [wiki page](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/SHA_password_hashes). (I know, you archlinux devs+mods got a whole shit-ton of things going on!)

I've been using Linux for a few years now. I was a Linux Mint user but with all the recent upstream issues with Gnome and Ubuntu I decided to move to openSUSE which I'm using now. It's a great distro and I'm loving KDE but ever since Gnome 3  and Unity I've been looking for a distro that gives more control to the user.

I've been researching Arch for a little while now to see if it is the distro for me. I have had look at the wiki and I definitely like the philosophy of the Arch Way. Having rolling updates as well is a big bonus for me.

Now I've read some reviews and I've read the wiki but it would be really good to hear from some fellow redditors

And one last thing, I am a bit worried if the maintenance is more trouble than its worth. Is bug fixing and editing config files a very frequent occurence in Arch to the point that it's just frustrating?

Thank you for any thoughts!

——————————

Games run perfectly unless stated

/u/flying-sheep's contributions:

* *SPAZ* 

* *Steel Storm* 

— Apparently some graphics bugs using Steam version

* *Limbo*

— This isn't a native game; it's a CrossOver games WINE wrapper with the Windows executable(s). No problems reported with it

* *Botanicula*

* *Vessel*

— Not too fast and looks oddly low-res on native solution

* *The Binding of Isaac

— The game often won't launch (Flash problem?) but when it does

— Custom-made [AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/tboi-wotl/) — apparently a bit slow (Flash?) but still faster than other versions.

/u/steelgargoyle's contributions:

* *Legend of Grimrock*

— Uses Nixstaller for installation

— Need to cd to '/usr/local/games/Grimrock' (or installation location) and execute Grimrock.bin.x86_64 directly

* *Frozen Synapse*

* *Cave Story +*

* *Bastion*

— Another Nixstaller/sudo issue.

— The game runs at 60FPS on Windows with a Steam launch option that I forget now — it's normally locked at 48FPS. As Bastion is not currently available on Steam-for-Linux I haven't been able to dig out that option from Google and test it

* *Torchlight*

— Works fine if using the 'torchlight-hib' package from the AUR.

* *Shatter*

— Nixstaller/sudo again. Not found a better way. 

* *Shank 2*

— Game executable apparently won't launch sometimes without root permissions — fairly sure the right value exported for LIB_GL_MESA (or somesuch) will correct this but have yet to test.

— /u/flying-sheep's custom-made [AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/shank2/)

* *Dungeons of Dredmor*

* *FTL*

* *Frozen Synapse*

* *Jamestown*

* *Dungeon Defenders*

— Need to run 'ln -s /bin/true /usr/bin/gnome-screensaver-command' before running through terminal. 

— Game doesn't work in full-screen mode and crashes often

* *Dynamite Jack*

* *Minecraft*

**Steam-only games** (Note: Steam games require 32-bit versions of graphics drivers (in my case

* *Unity of Command*

— Had to remove libpangoft2-1.0.so.0 from ~/.local/share/Steam/SteamApps/common/Unity of Command Demo/bin to resolve fonts issue (thanks /u/zoku88). 

— Add 'sdl-fullscreen' as a launch option in Steam to run in 'proper' full-screen mode. 

* *Team Fortress 2* 

* *Waveform*

* *Serious Sam 3*

— Performance is a bit poor: the game seems to stutter quite a lot with VSync on but tearing occurs without it on my system

* *Killing Floor* 

* *Cubemen*

**Other games**

* *Baldur's Gate 2* (via GOG) 

— See post by /u/crayZsaaron [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/baldursgate/comments/155cpx/how_to_get_gogs_baldurs_gate_ii_complete_running/)

I've been a Archlinux user for well over 3 years by this point. I think it's a pretty good distro

* **The /usr/bin/python -&gt; python3 switch** - Python 3 is in no way ready to become /usr/bin/python ANYWHERE and every distro besides Arch seems to realize that. Even the hardcore Python3 fans say Python3 is still a few YEARS away from being usable as /usr/bin/python. Yes, WeeChat as an example had to add a bunch of new variables and stuff to their python plugin to make it work with Arch's /usr/bin/python being python3. Not because it was ported to python3, but because it was hacked up to use /usr/bin/python2 on Arch and /usr/bin/python everywhere else, basically.
* **The GNOME3 fiasco** - I know, it was pushed WAY too early IMO and there currently is no real way to get GNOME2. I know there's Mate, but Mate is really the wrong way to do a fork. Also, because of Arch's stupid policies of doing rebuilds for every soname bump instead of multiple, versioned packages for a library or slotting like Gentoo, you can't just IgnorePkg all the GNOME packages and update your system as normal. If you want to do that, you have to watch VERY closely when a soname rebuild happens and rebuild the relevant GNOME packages yourself and go through hell on big bumps like libpng.
* **Optdepends** - I'm a developer
* I already touched on soname rebuilds and i think it's better to do versioned libraries or slotting as i said
* **The ridiculous stabilization process** - As we all probably know, new versions of core packages and a big suite upgrade (like KDE 4.6 -&gt; 4.7 or GNOME 2.30 -&gt; 2.32). I think this is a mistake, but we'll let that slide. For the packages that do require signoffs, the process is simply 2 signoffs per arch. It doesn't have to have been in the repo for a certain amount of time, the devs don't have to check the bugtracker or forums for users having (possibly massive) issues. This is a HUGE mistake IMO. This is partially why i recommend NO ONE run Archlinux on a server.
* **Bleeding edge to a degree that breaks things** - As of a while ago, but it still got into the tree for a while. Perl 5.14 is currently stable in Arch (and a core package on top of that) which means if you're an Android dev/ROM maker, you can not build Android from source on Archlinux because part pf the build is broken due to perl 5.14 changing stuff and some regular old perl modules won't build. There are just 2 examples, but i'm sure i could find a lot more if i chose to.

Now. Why I went to Gentoo and why you should too:

1. The compile times aren't really an issue anymore if you have a modern system. Computers have gotten a lot faster, also, you don't have to compile Firefox, there's firefox-bin) + other sundry apps on my Desktop which is effectively a Core i7 with 8 ""cores"", it was MAYBE 2 hours. A bit more because i was faffing about trying to get my USE flags and stuff just so, but i'm anal. I also installed pretty much the same setup (main difference: firefox-bin instead of firefox) on my beater laptop which is a 2.2GhZ single-core Celeron and it took less than 8 hours.
2. Gentoo is **NOT** for ricers. Sure, but 95% (probably more) of Gentoo users are just using simple, sane CFLAGS.
3. Gentoo's biggest gain is not performance. I want to make that clear. The performance is a nice bonus
4. Gentoo is actually stable. For a package to go into the stable tree, but it's SO EASY and POSSIBLE to pull in single packages from testing that even for a desktop, it's great. I don't care about my Glibc being bleeding-edge, but I do want my bleeding-edge git and vim...I can do that on Gentoo.
5. Gentoo is truly simple. As one example, they're not all just frontends to the same primary package manager.
6. Relating to #3 and #4

Then there's the rolling release aspect of it. Full releases haven't ever made sense for me.

1370058394.0,1fg3y9,Guide to running Windows 7 in QEMU,,49,11,17,"I was trying to get this working earlier and found it a bit confusing

First install the QEMU package.

    # pacman -S qemu

Next create the disk image that Windows will be installed into. I would recommend keeping the disk image and install ISO in the same folder, but you might want more or less. I would also use the qcow2 format, which doesn't automatically take up all the space you've allotted before the virtual machine uses it.

    $ qemu-img create -f qcow2 disk.qcow2 40G

Next you'll need to either copy a Windows 7 ISO from a disc or download a legal ISO from Microsoft. If the former, copy the iso to your hard drive. The device name of your ODD will likely be /dev/sr0, but if it's something different make sure to modify the command.

    $ dd if=/dev/sr0 of=install.iso

If you don't have a CD, but I won't condone that in my post (wink, wink). Download the ISO [here](http://www.w7forums.com/official-windows-7-sp1-iso-image-downloads-t12325.html). Rename it to something sane like **install.iso** and move it to the folder you have the disk image saved in.

Next you need to enable KVM, enter

    # modprobe kvm_intel

If the latter:

    # modprobe kvm_amd

We also probably want these modules to load at boot. To set this up

    # nano /etc/modprobe.d/kvm.conf

In this file

    kvm_intel

or

    kvm_amd

depending on your processor. Now the modules will be present after a reboot.

From here on out I'm going to assume your disk image is called disk.qcow2, try ""qemu-i386"" instead of ""qemu-system-x8664"". I set the memory that the virtual machine can use to 4096MB, which is around half the total RAM of my system. Again, modify this based on your system and how much RAM you think the VM needs (keeping in mind that Windows requires 1GB of RAM for i386 and 2GB for x86_ 64).

    $ qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -m 4096 -cdrom install.iso -boot d disk.qcow2

This will start the VM in a new window. Go through the install process. Once everything is running, virginal Linux system.

To start your VM after shutting it down

    qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -m 4096 -vga std -daemonize ~/machines/windows/disk.qcow2

This adds a few commands that make the script more useful. ""-vga std"" lets the machine's resolution be adjusted beyond 1024x768. ""-daemonize"" detaches the QEMU process from the terminal

Some more handy tips: press ctrl-alt to free the mouse from the virtual machine

Good luck!

EDIT: 
Some further notes:

If you using a tiling window manager

SOUND: So I've been playing around with sound for a while, the necessary steps seem to be as follows.

First you need to set the QEMU audio driver to ALSA

    $ export QEMU_AUDIO_DRV=alsa

You probably want this to be persistent, or whatever autostart file you use.

    $ nano ~/.bash_profile

Add line:

    export QEMU_AUDIO_DRV=alsa

Now that the QEMU audio is set right

    $ qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -m 4096 -vga std -daemonize -soundhw ac97 ~/machines/windows/disk.qcow2

Download the Realtek AC97 driver for Windows 7 from [this page](http://www.realtek.com.tw/downloads/downloadsView.aspx?Langid=1&amp;PNid=14&amp;PFid=23&amp;Level=4&amp;Conn=3&amp;DownTypeID=3&amp;GetDown=false). Download this file on the Windows machine

If it's not visable it either switches to or turns on that tab depending on if you're pressing ctrl. If no instance of the application is running it launches a new one.

1336823769.0,tjjwr,archlinux: a how-to in troubleshooting for newcomers.,zendeavor,58,20,15,"hi

so, then you've chosen a **fantastic**, *user-friendly* distribution from which to build a strong foundation of knowledge and experience. don't believe me? you're just scared. the beginner's guide is long, the installation guide is dense, the wiki is overloaded with information. i understand how this can make you wary.

if you have used linux before

there's only one thing you need to understand: **troubleshooting**. how does one learn to troubleshoot? well

so you've encountered an erroneous application in your system; congratulations! here's what to do.

ask yourself, here's the first thing we'll say. *run the program from your terminal and show us any relevant errors or warnings it prints.* this applies to both types of apps, so abuse your newfound power with each.

did this spit out any reasonably useful information? if yes, widen them by removing references to details of your specific machine; this includes absolute paths, process ids, timestamps, and a variety of other things that you will easily spot.

if no useful information is printed, such as -vvv, or -v -v -v will be higher levels of verbosity) but sometimes it is a synonym for --version. the -d flag takes on a multitude of different meanings, such as daemonize(background the process after starting, almost like appending `&amp;' to the command), debug(self-explanatory), or even detach[ed] (in tmux, just check the manpage. it takes less than a minute

still stuck? that's okay, e.g. ""myapp"" crashes when i open a plaintext file. use google's search options to narrow it down, if this problem did not exist before by choosing to search for results from the past week or month. also, maybe just throw in ""archlinux"" as an extra search keyword. you should notice a trend! see if you can spot it real quick..........

did you figure it out? lots of results will be from arch's bbs! this is a hint that maybe you should check there for similar problems and potential solutions if or when google fails you. so that's your next task. check the arch bbs and wiki for more help before coming to us in #archlinux =]

still no fixes? that's okay, or you can use the arrow keys. use '/' or '?' to search for a term forward or backward, respectively. see what packages were upgraded lately, and determine their relationship with the program you are having problems with. **then** and **only then** is it okay to try downgrading, but for a specific reason. we want to determine if this is a bug introduced in an updated package. so you will use something akin to `pacman -U /var/cache/pacman/pkg/package-version.string.pkg.tar.xz` and try to run your program again. does the problem persist? if no, congratulations! you now have a bug to report to us at bugs.archlinux.org, so please assist the community by doing so. if the issue still occurs, but i would never expect you to go this far, you can just install the package again and pacman will print it neatly to your console. verify that you have taken any necessary steps outlined there.

the next step is to check your configurations. did you change any settings recently? change them back and see if the problem still occurs. then

the final step is almost completely optional. **almost**. generally no one gets irritated if you leave this one out, but a quick hint can be found with `pacman -Si pkgname`)

if you're still stuck, or otherwise you will have to field a half-dozen questions from us like ""did you check the bbs? did you google it? does the bug persist in older versions? have you done a `pacman -Syu` recently? did you check our wiki page yet?"" and that is undesirable. so let us know what you've done, drop us a link or two to results that offered solutions that did not work for you, and also drop us a link to a pastebin of some error or warning output from your console(we are partial to [sprunge](http://sprunge.us) and [gist](http://gist.github.com), for what it's worth. pastebin.com is discouraged). be patient, and someone will be there soon to help you out. the beautiful thing is that we will be capable of getting right down to the root of the problem much quicker than if we had to hold your hand through all these steps, so we all can spend much less time on the problem and will have you back in working condition in a shorter timeframe than would otherwise be possible!

and that's it! if you follow these steps, this will become second nature to you after exercising these practices only a few times.

They're as close to a ""vanilla"" install as I can make them without making them non-functional on EC2. But here's the list of differences between the EC2 builds and a stock install:

* Kernel modules included in initrd

* Packages removed: initscripts

* Extra packages installed: netcfg, ec2-keyring, ec2-pacman-mirrors, rng-tools, systemd-sysvcompat

* Added an extra package source for ec2-specific packages. the repository currently contains: ec2-keyring, yaourt.  I'm working on porting cloud-init to Arch Linux so that we don't use the really funky rc.local setup I have it currently using.

* systemd used instead of sysvinit. I also have a flag in my build process which allows me to build it with sysvinit as the default

* Additional services enabled at boot: rngd

* User's public key is pulled from the EC2 instance metadata service at startup

* SSH configured with 'PasswordAuthentication no'

* pacman loads (and automatically lsigns) the 'archlinux' and 'ec2' keyrings on the first boot (the latter keyring contains my public key used for package signing in the ec2 repo).

* pacman mirror list is automatically selected at boot based on a list I created (based on rankmirrors run on instances in each region). These lists are provided by the package ec2-pacman-mirrors

* dhclient is used instead of dhcpcd for robustness reasons. I found that dhcpcd gave up too quickly if it tried to do a DHCPREQUEST when the vif wasn't completely up

* dhclient is configured to retry forever, time-offset, routers, domain-name, domain-name-servers, host-name, interface-mtu

* /usr/bin/pinentry is symlinked to /usr/bin/pinentry-curses instead of the default pinentry-gtk

There is one major caveat I know of at the moment. If you launch one of these and create an EBS AMI snapshot based on your instance

Most of the time

* copy/paste from the clipboard across applications with ctrl+shift+c and ctrl+shift+v.

* can choose a custom font and a font rendering style (through the Gnome preferences menu) that is respected by the terminal

What I don't like about it:

* Annoying to copy my color scheme preferences from one machine to another
* The way it handles alt-key combinations is apparently different from other terminals in a way that Vim doesn't like.
* Having to use the Gnome preferences menu to tweak the font settings
* I seem to recall that there were a few other minor annoyances

Another important thing to note is that I'm not using Gnome in my Arch install, script snippets), and I also miss having tabs.

I don't really need a lot of features, but I could probably survive without them if I had to. A lightweight solution would be nice, but I don't have a particular need for something especially lean.

Ideally it would have window controls on the exposed side of the window, then the last, the middle window should slide over to the left or the right part of the screen so that it would remain visible, instead of getting lost like it does in a floating WM.

Aura is a package manager for Arch Linux with full support for installing and upgrading AUR packages.
With version 1.1 it has many new features to make managing your system easier.

## New with Version 1.1
 * `--save` option. Stores a record of all installed packages.
 * `--restore` option. Restores a state stored with `--save`. Good for reversing system breakage.
 * `-k` suboption of `-A`. Shows PKGBUILD diffs when installing / upgrading.
 * `--aurignore` option. Ignores given AUR packages when installing / upgrading.
 * Bash and zsh completions now available.
 * Aura now reads pacman-color's /etc/pacman.d/color.conf if available. This affects the colours in `-Ai` and `-As`.
 * Aura now stores the most recent PKGBUILD when installing a package. This is so `-Ak` has something to diff with when upgrading next.
 * Much cleaner code.

## On the Horizon
 * Fish completions.
 * Reworked PKGBUILD parser.
 * Haskell binding to libalpm.

A big thanks to all of Aura's users! I couldn't have got this far without your support.

Hey fellow Arch lovers. Thanks for all the help [the first time around.](http://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/l62wo/so_close_yet_so_far_away_problems_with_arch/)

I've been blissfully using Arch for over a month now. I'm dual-booting on a Macbook Pro. However this morning


GRUB _


...much to my horror. Most of the battle with the Arch install the first time around was from GRUB

I've been across all edges of the internet to try and find a solution. No amount of reinstalling GRUB has worked. I suspected my device.map file was funny

I love Arch way too much to give it up, in this install to wipe it and start over from scratch. What could the problem be? Could an update have messed something up? Is my MBR shot? I just have no idea.

Please and thank you for any help you can offer.


**EDIT:** Can someone who dual-boots satisfy my curiosity and post their device.map?

**EDIT 2:** On a Macbook Pro booting with REFIT. I then choose Linux

**EDIT 3:** In my REFIT menu I've always had THREE choices:

* Boot MAC OS X from Macintosh HD

* Boot Linux from HD

* Boot Linux from Partition 3

The second option is the one I always used with Arch. I think it's a leftover (somehow) of my Mint install (which I no longer have), and GRUB, are installed.

**EDIT 4:** I tried booting with both a USB plugged in AND the Arch live CD in. When I selected the third boot option (boot from partition 3)

**SOLVED** FINALLY. Turned out the MBR was fucked. Had to poke around on my OSX side. Using:

sudo fdisk -u /dev/disk0

cleared up the MBR. Reinstalling GRUB one last time fixed everything up. Thanks for all your patience!",,t5_2qrzu,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/mbjll/my_beloved_arch_died_this_morning/

I tried installing last night via CD, had some weird update issues that I think is because I didn't put in my own mirror-list/edit it, the one it was trying to connect to, it couldn't connect apparently, but it kept going anyways so I think my install was kinda botched anyways. I was also trying to install on my USB hdd which was probably a silly idea anyways without trying to install for a USB manner. I figured I would try though either way. I think I managed to get through the entire install process, but for obvious reasons I can't boot into it via USB HDD.

Also in the process setting up the swap partition, I was planning on reformatting anyways. 

Losing is fun

But I do have a question, how much does that effect the performance of it all? Or would it be better/easier to just make a linux partition on one of my drives. Also, say my 3 drives are full partition spaces, would I have to wipe the entire thing to make a new small partition, or can it just slice it from the free space?

I'm using Arch Linux and today i decided to see if i can put it in AUR since i see all sorts of interesting stuff there. Well, installs the binaries for the program and a utility to convert hnb files and finally docs and manpages for the program, the utility and the file format. I believe it is a generally complete package, but i would *really* like feedback on it, since it is the first package i ever make (for any distribution, not just Arch).

Now, here i am just one hour after learning these things and the program is already available for people to install with `yaourt` or similar front-ends. This is a great contrast to my Debian experience of having my Nikwi game being added in the repositories more than a year later after i made the release (i'll add it in AUR at some point later, but it needs *much* more work than Outliner Lighto, mostly because it is a codebase i haven't touched since 2006).

Everyone in the house will get between 65% and 90% packet loss.  Internal connections

Nothing has changed with my router settings or Arch other than the use of Crashplan for local backups.  I discovered that Crashplan can cause inotify watch issues and was receiving ""No space left on device"" errors when running systemctl commands so I greatly increased the maximum inode values.  This has lessened the occurrence of the No space left errors but I am still getting them randomly.  I have since disabled the crashplan backup server in hopes that it was somehow the issues but that did not help either.

To test that it is the desktop when Arch is running I wait until connectivity issues arise and then verify it with my laptop and with a PS3 running Hulu.  Both devices fail to make consistent successful outbound connections.  If I turn off the ethernet connection manually inside Arch

At this point I am completely at a loss and will try any suggestions.  Here is my current PC setup as well as the network situation.  If anything is unclear please yell at me and tell me to fix it.  Any help/suggestions are greatly appreciated.

**Network:**

*Router 1 (Main) :* 

+ Connected to the cable modem with one hardwired device

+ WPA2 secured wireless signal. SPI firewall

+ Handles static IPs for my desktop and Raspberry PI

*Router 2 (Bridge) :*

+ Serves as wireless hardware bridge for ethernet hookup for my desktop and pi.

+ SPI firewall off

**PC:**

+ Arch / Win 7 dual boot - assigned static IP by the main router

+ Windows and Arch are on separate hard disks

+ Windows can run indefinitely and causes no connectivity issues

Again no issues until about a week ago and I cannot wait to fix this as I only use Windows for gaming so its killing any work from home.

**EDIT:** Formatting
  
**Update**
[Dmesg](http://pastebin.com/cUiKuFUA) and [journalctl](http://pastebin.com/yyEfZpZY) outputs
  
I have tried enabling and disabling my media server as well as crashplan but they do not seem to help.  I have also now tried pinging both routers from multiple devices and when the desktop shuts down the connections for everyone the packet loss occurs when attempting to reach my main router (Router 1) but the devices tested have no problem reaching the bridge(Router 2)  which is wirelessly connected to the network and hardwired only to the desktop. Thanks again.

**Update 2**

I saw the post concerning the move to netctl and I made the transition and decided the check for updates before a reboot.  Updated systemd and after the reboot I have a much better situation.  I will get occasional drops but it is no longer crippling other devices and is fully functional 90% of the time.  Not the best resolution but something I can live with at the moment as I am rather busy.  Thanks for the suggestions.

* [Dvorak UK layout with UK punctuation](http://www.tarind.com/ukdvorak.png)

    sudo loadkeys dvorak-uk

The above keymap maintains most US punctuation keys with a few minor changes such as adding a sterling symbol. On the other hand

    setxkbymap gb -variant dvorak

and it brings up the Dvorak UK layout that I normally use perfectly. As far as I am aware

Is there any way I could export my X keymap to a .map file for use in the console? I have searched far and wide for a UK punctuation .map file but have only found a Windows .klc. I never noticed there was another variant in use before as I have only ever used Linux with X11 before installing Arch.

Since I always do a netinstall, and other times it will not.

After installing arch, the monitor power light will go amber with a completely black screen.

I have attempted unplugging and plugging in my keyboard and mouse

I have tried looking in dmesg

Has anyone seen an issue like this in the past??

It is also important to note that occasionally when this happens a fan (not sure which one since I am usually a bit perturbed when it occurs) in my case spins up and just stays running at full blast until I kill the power.

I am using Ubuntu 8.04 and my laptop works great. However recently I have been encountering issues with out of date software due to the age of my distro ( LTS........). Now that 10.04 is coming I will be upgrading again

I have read that the wiki pages on arch are top quality for any level but I am writing my PhD soon and I don't want to have to spend loads of time fiddling to get everything working perfectly again. My Linux level is ok ( well I dont know) I am comfortable with the command line but I have become overly reliant on the copy paste method of doing stuff from the interwebs

So my question is

1: Is arch readily accessible quick to get into a working reliable everyday desktop space?

2: What linux level is recommended to fully exploit Arch over just firing an Ubuntu CD into my drive

Note: I know that by using Arch my linux experience will sky rocket quickly but as I said there is a PhD to be done and that has priority at the moment.

So what is it that systemd is causing it to fail in preventing the screen from switching off? - see this [linky](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1153725).

For my 1024x600 screen
xrandr --output LVDS1 --mode 1024x600 --scale 1.25x1.25 --panning 1280x750


Arch was for a long time my favorite linux distribution. The update in march made panning not work any more; the mouse becomes trapped within a border the size of the original screen, and the fact that it makes netbooks very hard to use, it was flagged as a low priority and ignored by the X.Org package maintainer. 

https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/24274

I did some testing to confirm it was not an intel driver update, submitted a bug report, annoyed some devs on the freenode channel, and basically got referred from one dev to another as they all told me it wasn't their area of expertise and that I should fix it myself. Despite an attempt at teaching myself the entire X.org subsystem, I came up empty handed.The attention died down. I accepted that to use my netbook, I would have to switch distributions. I have been running gentoo with their X.Org updated to the same version and its working fine. It must be some patching done by the arch devs itself that broke it. Yes, this issue is that important to some of us that we will leave arch rather than have our computers crippled. Nowadays

Why hasn't it been fixed? I will try to fix it again

Is there anything I should change this time around? As far as storage and partition sizes are concerned, so are there any things I could do to make the system more efficient?

I've gotten so far with dual-booting ArchLinux

* I followed the Macbook wiki and general install guide until the reboot section
* Within the guide
* I installed grub
* Did the default config for mkinitcpio

Now things looked good, it would just keep sending me to Mac. I tried:

* I folder blessed the new boot volume and the grub efi
* I did not mount bless or use the --setBoot option

Now

However

edit updated info:

The uuid matches sda6

Night 3: Holy shit.

Day 4: Managed to complete an install of Arch on my laptop. Several issues arose before this was successful.

1. I could not pick packages, I had to let it auto-configure, though I got it close enough to my specs that I'm okay with it.

2. My wireless card was not connecting from the get-go. Had to find documentation on how to associate it with the network and allow it to connect. Finally succeeded.

3. After finishing the installation successfully

Night 4: The learning experience continues. Glad I have my desktop while I make my laptop explode with this. 

Update 1 - Night 4: Currently baffled by the fact that my wireless card unassociates itself with the network on every reboot. Have to figure out a way to fix that. Also unable to create or write to files without being logged in as root. - FIXED

Update 2 - Night 5: Fixed my wireless, despite registering an IP address. On top of that, wicd just hangs at ""Validating authentication"", despite all entered information being correct. Urk. - FIXED

One of the first things I had noticed was dwm by default didn't have any function that allowed you to move to the left or right of the currently selected tag. In awesome,l} to feel more vim like, and since I never resize windows).

When I went on dwm's irc channel to inquire about this, and just learned by messing around). Someone then pointed me towards a link that sort of explained how they should be used.

After reading it I understood why 'moving to the left or right' of a tag didn't really make sense (but I still ended up finding a patch for it since I find it an easy way to navigate between tagged windows).

This got me thinking about how people use tags in tiling window managers. Is it more efficient to treat them as labeled workspaces? For example, while more organized, kind of restricts how dynamic your workflow can be. On the other hand, leaving the tags unlabeled and deciding on the fly what a tag should be used for seems less restrictive and allows you to further divide a task and then pull the sub-divisions into focus when you need them. Although I do find it convenient to set certain programs to open under a predetermined tag, so that they doesn't distract me if I happened to run them while in the middle of something else.

So I just reinstalled Arch Linux. Clean install, when I try and do ""sudo pacman -Syu"" I get ""sudo: unable to open /var/db/sudo/mab/2: Read-only file system"" and ""error: no usable package repositories configured."" Can't copy or move or edit any files at all. Completely read only. 





I'm not sure what the problem is, 16G root partition, 8G SWAP, and 35G home partition. I followed all of the wiki directions when using cgdisk and everything should be properly aligned in 2048 blocks (sic?) 




As for my /etc/fstab... I currently have /dev/sda1 (root) with ""rw,data=ordered"" and ""0 1."" For /dev/sda3 (home) I have the same options but ""0 2."" Both are ext4 and mounted in the right places. I mentioned above that I'm using an SSD, which is why I have the discard and noatime flags, but I was having the same read only problem with the default fstab settings, too (relatime and no discard, iirc). 





I apologize if this doesn't help very much, I'm not sure what the problem is (which is why I'm asking here), so if you need any information I'll be more then happy to provide it. 



Thanks for your help 

Edit: well, the backlight won't even come on. I still have the install disk so I should be able to troubleshoot, but I am completely dumbfounded as to what is going on.

I worked around this by making my DSDT send the keycodes that asus-laptop likes to see.

1. Obtain your current DSDT table: `cp /sys/firmware/acpi/tables/DSDT ./DSDT.dat`

2. Install `acpica` from the AUR. The version in there is out of date: you may want to change the version to 20130725 which is

3. Use iasl to decompile the table: `iasl -d DSDT.dat`

4. Open up the resulting DSDT.dsl file with your favourite text editor and locate methods _Q0E ([original](http://slexy.org/view/s2b65dWp2a)) which is called when you press Fn+Display Brightness Down and _Q0F ([original](http://slexy.org/view/s2I8QPvMfw)) which is called on Fn+Brightness Up.

5.  I changed the methods to these:

        Method (_Q0E
        {
            //The If (LGreaterEqual (OSFG
            If (ATKP) //Hotkey driver attached
            {
                \_SB.ATKD.IANE (0x20) //Send 0x20 keypress
            }

            Return (One)
        }


        Method (_Q0F
        {
            If (ATKP)
            {
                \_SB.ATKD.IANE (0x2F)
            }

            Return (One)
        }

6. You may need to fix some errors in your DSDT. Thankfully

7. Compile the new dsdt: `iasl DSDT.dsl`

8. If it all went well

9. After rebooting

The downside to this is that you can't use your brightness keys to set the brighness in a console any more

Hi

I've recently been trying to install Arch Linux alongside Windows 8 on my laptop with a UEFI motherboard

To start with I formatted a USB drive, and the fix suggested was to use rEFInd instead.

I followed the instructions to set up rEFInd, but then this is what I get:

It gets stuck in that loop indefinitely and doesn't let me into any prompt. Apparently there's a common ""30 second"" error with /dev/disk/by-label if the USB drive is labelled incorrectly

I was advised to try [booting the ISO from RAM](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/USB_Installation_Media#Boot_the_entire_ISO_from_RAM), I find out that the current release of syslinux (used in the aforementioned guide) doesn't support UEFI. But the latest release candidate does. Except they don't offer a download for binaries, and for the life of me, after lots of stuffing around and frying my brain I cannot figure out how to build the Makefiles in Windows. I can't guarantee that I'd be able boot with the latest syslinux binaries anyway.

Basically I'm wondering if anyone has any idea on how I should proceed here

The first is battery life. I'm using a brand new Thinkpad W530 with a 9 cell battery. I'm lucky if I get 2-3hrs of battery use. As a matter of fact, and before I go to class, I check up on what I missed overnight. In ~40min - 1hr of just internet (FB, Twitter, baseball blogs, etc), the battery percentage goes from ~97% to somewhere in the 70's. To me that seems very excessive.

I'm using Gnome3 for my desktop. I also have laptop-mode-tools installed and that's configured except for the screen dimming because I usually do that myself anyway. I also have in my grub line:

but that seems to have done nothing. On Powertop

Is there anything else I can change that will make this last like it should? The thing is

One is onboard intel that supports 1 VGA, and 1 HDMI.  I currently have monitors 1 and 2 connected to DVI and DisplayPort on the onboard intel.

The other is an nVidia 8400 PCI-E card.


**Here's the setup I want**:


3 monitors with 3d support


**Here's the problem**:


Start gdm, it gives me an error about the number of devices not matching screens and errors out during the configuration.  If I adjust the xorg.conf to have an additional screen and card, both a duplicate of the intel screen/device sections (with a new screen number), I can get the nouveau screen and intel screens to start under gdm/gnome3, except 3d doesn't work (gdm/gnome3 are in fallback mode), and the intel screens are mirrored versus separate screens.

Additional info:  /etc/X11 and /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/ is empty/blank except for the default files; that is

I am trying to install Arch alongside OSX on my macbook. Was a Mint user before this

I have read *everything* there is to be read about this process, and tried just about everything, but attempting to load Arch through refit (and then through grub) just hasn't worked. I also had to hack the grub install because:

* On the selection screen to choose the partition to place grub in, as I know they're supposed to.

I only have three partitions:

* sda1: Unique mac thing (Fat32)

* sda2: Main OSX partition (HST+ or whatever)

* sda3: Area for linux (ext4)


I stopped bothering with a swap after nothing was working. Basically two things are happening:

* GRUB doesn't install the way it's supposed to

* After hacking an install and getting apparent ""success"" Arch still doesn't load. Either I get nothing but a GRUB prompt, but in the end it complained /dev/sda3 couldn't be found. Wonderful.


Please

EDIT: I have woken up! A good sleep refilled my patience meter. Time to check the comments.

EDIT2: Anyone willing to skype with me through the install? (I've got two computers)

EDIT3: Going to try making a separate partition for /boot (ext2), then see what happens.

**Results of EDIT3** Choosing ""Boot to Linux"" in refit seems successful at first, giving me nothing but ""grub&gt;"" to work with. Is there a way to proceed from here?

EDIT4: **GRUB LIVES!**

Now I just need to convince grub that /dev/sda3 actually exists...

I'll start with the reason I want to do this as maybe there's a better solution. Ideally I'd like to keep kde installed and just not update it with my normal updates, and also I normally use xfce and slim as my login manager, everytime kde gets updated it changes itself to be the default login session which is simply annoying making me reset it after each system update. 

Afaik really the only thing I care about related to kde is kdevelop

Just last weekend I installed an APC UPS backup battery with a USB connection since the server runs a RAID that can easily get messed up if the computer isn't shutdown properly. Due to a number of complications

Anyway, the server automatically hibernated and turned off the battery, and then came out of hibernate when the power was restored. That, or the battery shutdown before the server could complete hibernation resulting in a journal recovery and fsck scan on reboot (like I said, didn't get to test this much).

The problem is that the entire system occasionally and randomly just freezes.  The entire computer.  No mouse, but I can't be sure.  It happens randomly, and nothing in particular seems to cause it.  Sometimes I'm just redditing on Firefox, sometimes playing Minecraft, sometimes doing nothing at all (I'll close the lid and come back in an hour or two to find an unresponsive computer).  Because of this, I can't narrow it down definitively to know what the problem is, but my intuition says it could be a misconfigured xorg.conf or something related to the drivers.

If you need more details, [rc.conf](http://cuzitproductions.webs.com/rc.conf), and my [xorg log](http://cuzitproductions.webs.com/Xorg.0.log) for now.  If any other information or logs are required, request them.  If anyone can help, I would greatly appreciate it, as this is very annoying.

(On a side note, too.  It goes black on the loading screen and in the main menu the graphics are fuzzy and miscolored, so you can't see anything.  OpenGL is functional, however.)

**EDIT:** Thanks for all the suggestions, or at the very least narrow the cause down a bit.  Thanks everyone!

**EDIT2:** Due to my [little mistake](http://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/f3k29/random_computer_freezes_with_arch_unsure_of_cause/c1d5ote), use them for a while, switch to Catalyst, and see if my system starts freezing after that.  If so, it's something to do with Catalyst.  I refuse to believe the issue can't be resolved, as the Catalyst drivers have worked *flawlessly* for me on other distros with similar setups, so why wouldn't they on Arch?  I'll try to have some new information to post tomorrow sometime as I will hopefully be able to narrow down the problem.  Again, everyone!

**EDIT3:** Big thanks to NihilisticAbandon, but in all cases it seems to be.  If anyone else has any problems similar to mine, I'm afraid I can't tell you what I did to solve this problem; making a stupid mistake and wiping my hard drive (see Edit2, above), I had to reformat Arch.  Other than the annoyance of having to redo everything, not only on Arch but on Windows as well, everything seems to be working much better than before, I guess. * shrugs *  I do regret not learning much from this experience

1321991027.0,mlsx3,Trouble booting the Arch install ISO off of a USB stick from GRUB 2,Klink-a-dink-dink,12,2,12,"**SOLVED!** See solution [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/mlsx3/trouble_booting_the_arch_install_iso_off_of_a_usb/c3258co?context=3)

**Goal:** Have a multiboot USB stick that can boot to multiple Linux distros through GRUB 2's ISO-booting feature.

**The Issue:** I can't get the Arch Linux install ISO to boot properly.

I've formatted the stick

It boots

I think the issue is my grub.cfg. I tried copying the one from the pendrivelinux tutorial, that reads: `archisobasedir=arch archisolabel=ARCH_201108`

When I tried those options, which is MULTITOOL. I also added the `ramdisk_size` and `locale` options.

It should be noted that this discussion ended *before* the official install ISO had loopback support

When I tried the `archisolabel=MULTITOOL` option, not the ISO filesystem.

So, GRUB boots the kernel, loads the inird, but then doesn't quite realize it should be mounting the ISO for the actual filesystem. (Or, if I go with the original options, doesn't realize that it should mount the USB stick to mount the ISO.)

Here's my grub.cfg on the stick:

    set timeout=10
    set default=0
    
    menuentry ""Arch Linux x86_64 Core Install ISO isofrom"" {
     loopback loop /isos/archlinux-2011.08.19-core-x86_64.iso 
     linux (loop)/arch/boot/x86_64/vmlinuz isofrom=/isos/archlinux-2011.08.19-core-x86_64.iso archisobasedir=arch archisolabel=ARCH_201108 ramdisk_size=75% locale=en_US.UTF-8
     initrd (loop)/arch/boot/x86_64/archiso.img
    }
    menuentry ""Arch Linux x86_64 Core Install ISO isofrom multitool"" {
     loopback loop /isos/archlinux-2011.08.19-core-x86_64.iso

In short, I'm sick of dealing with poor/incomplete Linux support by companies like AMD (not to mention I won't stand for any more random X server freezes that cause me to lose all my work; the log file always cites the same line within some piece of AMD source code that I can't diagnose, modify, so I figure the right move is to start using the open source drivers.

Uninstalling and installing the drivers was easy. More difficult is getting the X configuration just right. I'm running three monitors off of my Radeon HD 5750: two off the VGA ports, now I have to set up the multihead configuration manually and no matter what I do, I can't even get things working like they were before.

At first I tried modifying my old xorg.conf file

Then I used KDE's monitor configuration tool, it only changes things on a per-session basis (and it doesn't touch the login manager so it's still cloned 1280x1024). I'd really prefer to have this in my xorg.conf file, as before.

So, I always ended up with cloned output. As usual, the dumb old X server acts like nothing is wrong and doesn't give me any helpful diagnostic information on why my configuration is wrong. (The day when Wayland replaces X and all its archaic baggage can't come soon enough; hopefully its way of configuring monitors won't be as head-bashingly terrible as X's.)

At one point, but I have no idea how to tweak it to get there and X isn't helping me out. Here's this xorg.conf: http://pastebin.ca/2085419

Does anyone know how to work from either of these configuration files to get the output I want? Or have a really good resource on how to set up multihead X configurations using open source drivers that might actually work for me?

5. Disabled LAN and only wireless vice varsa

I have a TP-LINK wireless card in so that I can switch connection and use any one at a time. I have to do this because the connections are not so stable And one might get down for a extended period of time

I have 2 Internet connections. 1Mbps each (believe me that is the best I can get). I have 2 routers running, as the default DNS are also god damn awful. 

And I don't even get 60KB up on any of them. But easily get 128KB on my laptop and netbook.

* 8GB Ram

* 3 disk drives

1350528851.0,11o3qb,Trouble Installing [Help],mpa1212,10,1,5,"So I had a go at installing Arch today
I have Windows 7 dual-booting with Wubi installed Kubuntu
I felt well prepared, filesystems, looking at their tips and troubleshooting.)
So to prepare for the install I freed up space on my main Hard Drive
Then I started Gparted in a LiveCD of Ubuntu, /var and /home. This is where it went wrong. Gparted took its time partitioning then suddenly closed, but it seemed to have completed its job because the partitions showed up in the explorer (blanking on its name). So I rebooted, to make sure all was going well (in windows) which it was not. Windows ran its check and detected errors, then restarted the computer. After the startup screen (before BIOS) all that would be displayed was a _ blinking in the top right corner. After trial and error(spamming f12 over and over on the starting screen after restarting) I got Arch to boot from the LiveCD (as my computer won't boot from USB for some reason) and started mounting the partitions and everything was working (going through the Beginners Guide) until I reached setting up mirrors, which when I tried to open Nano would result  in an error complaining about the Terminal and linux (but the linux would switch depending on xterm (?)). I managed to open it with Vi (first time using Vi) and see that everything looked ok. The big trouble started when I tried to update,download or synch packages (pacman and pacstrap). No matter what I did it would not verify the keys (Tried pacman-key -init


TL:DR Tried installing Arch, packages wouldn't verify). 

Any ideas of what I can do to fix Windows and get Arch up and running and what went wrong? 
I have a Arch CD and Ubuntu lying around

Edit 1:The data which was important is fine
As for what happens at start up what happens is that when I turn the computer on a screen that displays a brand name and f2 for setup
When I boot from the hard drive Windows is on it gives an error and asks to boot from a floppy. If I try to put the Windows CD in it asks to install windows or repair
I can get into Ubuntu from the CD which runs fine.


Edit/Update 2: Got Arch working! What I did was turn all the partitions I had into unallocated space then used Arch's partitioner while installing

The basis of the issue is that I will execute a `systemctl poweroff` or `systemctl reboot`, nor does the magic sysrq appear to have any effect (I enabled it in `/etc/sysctl.conf`).

After a while of waiting and nothing happening, however, there are corrupt files following an update and I will have to chroot in from a CD and reinstall those packages with the `--force` option.

Does anyone have any idea what might be causing this issue

My hard drive layout is like so:

`/dev/sda1` - ext4

`/dev/sda2` - ntfs

`/dev/sdb1` - ntfs

Everything has been running smoothly until I tried to install the bootloader. The imac has an EFI motherboard instead of BIOS, but I can't boot from EFI because the bootloader isn't installed because the cd doesn't boot from EFI. It seems like I'm caught in a catch 22 here. If anyone knows of a way around this or something that I'm (very likely) doing wrong it would be greatly appreciated.",t5_2qrzu
