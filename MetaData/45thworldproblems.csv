We almost remember but then Logic takes hold. We must continue on. We must unveil the next I. We must expand the We. The I's must become of We. Must. We are many seeking Oneness.

Johnson lived alone with his wife and four children on the second floor of a bungalow. It was a rather pretty house in an unattractive sort of way

This very morning, and then drank some of it, wrinkling his long, stubby nose as he did so. The legitimately illicit beverage had a hot, fiery, bland flavour and Johnson was compelled to wash it down with another swig of the same, but realised that he didn’t feel like it. Instead, comfortable armchair as he paced around the room. As he drained the last dregs from his tall slender glass, and Johnson was dry-eyed as the boastful modesty of the scene moved him to tears.

But Johnson realised with mounting uncertainty that it was time for him to set off to his place of employment. He had been made redundant many years ago, which had been hit badly by the recession and was flourishing in the booming economy.

Shuffling with a drunken sobriety, its smoothly oiled hinges creaking loudly. Wrapped in his favourite coat, which he had never really been fond of, he stroked the thick hair of his bald head and limped gracefully along the smooth gravel path.

After a long walk, women and children who were busily going about their business, but still, he saw no one.

 Coming to the large oaken doors of the building where he worked, and he could clearly see Mavis, his secretary, inside. As he knocked upon the door, she shot him an angry look accompanied by a rude gesture, thus letting him know that he was welcome.

Gently heaving the doors open, and as soon as he had finished strolling hurriedly into the building, they slid shut smoothly behind him.

Mavis gave him an expressionless smile. She was a young, as a single man, he had no reason not to be romantically interested in her, but then again, what would his wife think? 

“Johnson

“Yes indeed!” Johnson denied

“You haven’t been working here long

“Oh yes

“I see- you’ve got the job and you can start today

With a firm shake of his head, he swept clumsily over to the elevator and walked up to the seventh floor. Stepping out, he found himself in a small, cramped office that stretched out bewilderingly in all directions. Feeling altogether too hot, he wiped the sweat from his brow, removed his hat and coat, then, sat in his usual place
