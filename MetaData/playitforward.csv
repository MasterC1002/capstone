Any gifts that remain unclaimed by that point will then be given away in another PiF on a later date. I'd hate to take away gifts from people that I've already chosen in this giveaway

I am doing this because I had to sell my gaming rig and most of these games no longer work on my PC.

UPDATE: ITS GONE. Congrats Kripple1301 on your new games collection. Have fun.

Hello Redditors! 
Yes I am indeed giving away a Wii U System + the game!
WHY AM I THIS CRAZY!!?? 
Because people out there need help. I am thankful to have such wonderful family and friends. Its hard making a living every day for some.
I am just a college student
No Iam not in debt nor super rich. (just a community college with FAFSA spoiled I know...and no Iam not using the FAFSA money )
I saved up enough for this PiF. Don't fret...its free! Or choose to pay some of it. But its PiF! Everyone loves free right?


Edit: Video for further truth! :)
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cu7eKPQzfbQ&amp;feature=plcp

clarification 
my friend had the idea of the console giveaway back when I started an idea to give something truly big! She suggested video games since it has become a big increase over the years.
Its midnight and family is sleeping so thats why I am a bit quiet haha and sleepy. 


Edit 1: WOW comments keep coming! Today I will be spending time to read through them all appropriately. (Was skimming through some on my phone) 
anyways thank you guys for writing others deserve it! Means a lot to me and the future winner. As for the system its on a online kart right now and contacted customer support and they were happy to hold it till I pay it off. Doing some xmas shopping so I can't go crazy spending with my checks haha  

WINNER!

It all started when I [made a comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/di095/to_support_indie_developers_and_because_im_a/c10cdzy) on our former moderator

I made a lot of good friends since the day this community was created, and got to know a lot with a huge heart. I always loved the generous spirit which is what makes reddit special for me, and this community definitely did not disappoint me in that regard.

-----------------------------------------------------

You might notice that not everything was given away. That's because I'm not going to give games to submissions that just don't meet my standards. And those standards aren't high, but I'll be keeping what wasn't given away for another give away to go up tonight or tomorrow. Or, maybe I thought your stuff was good enough to win, but you didn't meet the requirements. That could mean bad ratio, not enough karma, not enough time, etc. 

-----------------------------------------------------------


**And we're closed folks. Thanks for playing

----------------------------------------------------------

~~**DON'T FORGET TO UPVOTE FOR VISIBILTY**~~

--------------------------------------------------------

**NOTE FOR WHEN YOU ENTER**: Please include your top 3 choices for games out of the category

It's time for my game giveaway specatular! 

See [these guys?](http://www.behealthybewellbeinspired.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/colorful_rainbow_party.jpg) That's how happy you're gonna be once you hear what's in here. 

You might be saying right now

First I'd tell you to shut up

How do you earn them? Quite simple really. 

---------------------------------------

**GROUP I

To enter in Group I, and take a picture of yourself then. Also, you may write me a set of 3 haikus. No particular subject, although sucking up is always allowed. 

--------------------------------------------

**GROUP II

To enter for group two's prizes, just make it great. (longer length will generally be more impressive, although shitty writing will have the opposite effect) Also acceptable: draw me the apocalypse. Actually, could be painted, drawn, oil pasteled, charcoaled

------------------------------------------------

**GROUP III

To enter here, you can take a picture of yourself in your greatest assassin-y pose. 

------------------------------------------------

**GROUP IV

And finally, because I said so. Alternate entry can be attained by making me some fantastic fan art of one of these games.

Now..... For the moment you've all been waiting for.....

***

[*] Anyone who enters for the Double Fine bundle will automatically be entered for Psychonauts. If you already have other games in the bundle

[&amp;dagger;] There are 2 copies available - one Complete Edition and one base game. The first person to be drawn for Frozen Synapse will win the Complete Edition

***

### The Procedure:

Because managing a drawing over Reddit comments is a royal pain in the ass

In order to enter

* Go [here.][form]
* Fill out your Reddit and Steam account info.
* Pick up to *10* games that you don't already own
* Click the big ""submit"" button at the end.

***

### The Rules:

To make sure everyone gets a fair chance

You can qualify to win by **either** of these methods:

* **Method 1.** Gray flair or better on /r/SGS
* **Method 2.** A Reddit account that is at least **2 months old** _and_ has at least **300 combined karma**.
* **You don't need both!**

_Sorry

If you already own a game

Drawings will be done automatically, go yell at the guy who created Python's random number generator.

The drawing script will draw a user's name. That user then wins whatever game they want the most that's still in stock. The game they won is taken from the stock, and repeat until out of games or out of users.

The drawing will happen on **Monday

***

### The Fine Print:

_Incomplete, and you will be ineligible to win if you are listed on the Shared Ban List, are marked as a scammer by any trade site, or are trade-banned, VAC-banned, subreddit-banned, SteamRep-banned, the most recent entry will be used. Games will only be given to the Steam account listed on the submission form. Games are for your personal use only, treat

***

### The TL;DR: Click [here, profit.

4. Over the next year

------------


So why the goodbye?

The biggest problem I had in all of this was vetting everyone.  Who should get games, I found that following proper PIF procedure was getting to be too much of a chore.

Now, even if they might turn out to be the bad apples mentioned earlier.  As I said, I believe that people are generally good.

------

First, I do these 'events' several times before moving on to my next idea.  Rest assured, unless you are living under a rock, you will NOT miss it! 

Here is what happens in this giveaway:

* Join my [steam group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/redditgiveaway/)
* Enter chat room **whenever there is an announcement** that indicates the game is starting (This will happen many times over the course of a few months).  It will be at a random time to give everyone a chance at participating. (The announcement should pop up in your steam so you will not miss it if you are online and have joined the group)
* Once you are in group chat
* When it is your turn
* Depending on your behavior, respect towards fellow players, and difficulty of the adventure chosen, you will get a list of games from which you may choose one.
* The longer this event goes on

------------------

**Special Notes**

* Please read the steam group rules
* The prize list will constantly be modified as trades are made to increase the amount of games I have
* I have RL matters to attend to so the contest may abruptly end at any time.  Although I will try to keep it going for hour long increments.  Thanks for your understanding!
* Last and probably most important, and try to have **FUN**

1341175460.0,vw4p7,The Binding of Isaac,jmarquiso,70,8,33,"I gave this away a few months ago

As the Binding of Isaac is about a general sense of loneliness against the world

Depress me.  Tell me how lonely it made you.  Make me cry.

But be sure to be funny.

I'll be deciding on a winner by Wednesday morning.  If there's a tie

Edit: Shit.  Now I'm depressed.

Edit2: [Perplexd pointed out this may be inappropriate](http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward/comments/vw4p7/the_binding_of_isaac/c58c7wh).  I will stand by it and say that this was not meant to be as serious as some have taken it.  I've run this giveaway before

That being said

Edit 3:

Deep discussion time.

Games provide escape.  The escape is not without challenges or hardship - quite the contrary.  The main difference between games and real life is that a reward is known and predictable.  In real life

Binding of Isaac is a really odd example.  It's about abuse, and is not easy.  It can be rather difficult at times, but it makes the rewards all the more sweeter.  Like most Roguelike inspired games, the goal is to fail, as every failure is closer to a win.  

This PiF has been more rewarding in meeting others with similar issues to mine, I suppose.  As a result, I've made more of an effort to get out into the new city I live in, today is no exception.

My advice on this forum is unsolicited

[pif0987throwaway](http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward/comments/vw4p7/the_binding_of_isaac/c58ab11) is our winner.  It satisfies both being depressing as well as the tragic irony of his situation.  I hope the game finds him well.  I will be in contact with him offline to deal with all the points and anonymity and all that.  It was a run between him and MissMelons.

I am sorry if people found this PiF offensive.  As I said it wasn't meant to be cruel in any way.  It's a $5 game

I spoke with several of the entrants offline about where they are.  Reddit can be an amazing community sometimes.

Enjoy.

edit 1: Sorry! need to be more clear. Please tell me why you can't afford the games. I'm also trying to buy from the summer sale so I can spread the love to a lot of different people.

edit 2:A shout out for Caliwolv who is doing an wesome job policing this thread. I truly want to give some games away and it's great someone is checking up on people who are asking.

Edit 3: Well I gave away a total of 13 games tonight and everyone was really appreciative. The sale continues tomorrow and I apologize if I didnt get to you. I will try again in this post tomorrow. I would like to add that I am disheartened by the amount of people who tried to con me into giving them a game. I want to help people truly less fortunate then myself. So from now on these are the following rules.

* Not having a credit card to buy games is not a reason to ask.
* avoiding your countries messed up rating system is not a good reason. I'm sure you can find someone to pay to gift it to you. You are not poor.
* I am not going to gift you a game because you are saving money for your vacation. It is sad I even have to address this. Don't ask if all you are trying to do is save money.
* I want to respect your parents wishes
* Game must be on sale. I am looking to gift to as many people as possible. This means shopping from the sales. If you don't like this I am sure someone would greatly appreciate any game from the sale. Most of what I gifted I had the person choose.
* Please include your steam ID in your post.

Just use common sense. I know there are selfish people out there

edit 4: Wow so many edits! I managed to give away a total of 14 games yesterday and want to give away a few more today. I'm here only for a few minutes and then I am on the road. Keep the comments coming and remember to tell me a little about you and your situation. I want to try to do this every day of the sale.

I gave a copy of a game to one such character. I gave him the game maybe a month ago and he has played it for maybe 6 minutes (according to his steam profile). There are plenty of other people I could have given that game to who would have enjoyed it and also continued playing it forward. It just irritates me to see people take advantage of Play It Forward and the kindness of the donors. 

To avoid this

**TL;DR   There are plenty of people taking advantage of the donors on PIF and have no intention of being kind. Just make sure the people you donate to are worthy of it.**

Here's me balancing my karma. I'm a Dota 2 trader

Well

* ~~Dota 2~~
* ~~Trine~~
* ~~Plain Sight x **2**~~
* ~~Warhammer 40K Dawn of War 2 - Retribution~~
* ~~Metro 2033~~ ~~Bastion~~
* ~~Overlord~~

* ~~Terraria~~
* ~~Dogfighter~~
* ~~The Orange Box~~
* ~~Serious Sam HD: Double Pack~~
* ~~Revenge of the Titans~~

* ~~Nation Red~~
* ~~Just Cause 2~~
* ~~Mirror's Edge~~
* ~~Osmos~~
* ~~Droplitz~~
* ~~Tiny Bang Story~~
* ~~Serious Sam HD: Second Encounter~~
* ~~Atom Zombie Smasher~~
* ~~Greed Corp~~
* ~~Hoard~~
* ~~RUSH~~
* ~~Alien Breed: Impact~~
* ~~Dead Horde~~

Now

* ~~Whoever guesses one of my two favorite heroes in Dota first will get the Dota 2~~ **JethroTheRetroMetro** guessed this one: It is **Sand King** and **Earthshaker.**
* ~~Whoever guesses my favorite number first in **the first 2 hours of the thread** will have first pick off the list - any title except Dota 2. After that
* ~~Whoever guesses which **two** are my most anticipated releases of 2012 has second pick. If no-one guesses both in the first 2 hours, I will use a rng, which is just me closing my eyes and scrolling up and down. It would really help if you had the game you're after specified in your post.

Other than that

Btw: Do DLC's count as PIFs or are the considered a part of the game? Not a big deal for me since I obviously want to give DLC's out with the games - just curious! What about the Orange Box? Or the Double Packs?

1307597348.0,hva35,My Resignation from PlayItForward and the gifting community,myrridin,69,7,71,"I have a bit of bad news.

As of the time of this posting, who is an excellent person and developer).

No doubt you're wondering why I've decided to do this. I'm not going to go through the details here but I can give you the key points.

1. The community no longer needs me - In fact perhaps it never did. PiF rolls forward and there are a number of great mods who are sticking around and will continue to do the same amazing job they have been. I expect nothing whatsoever to change

2. I don't have the time - I spend 2 - 3 hours every day moderating and working on PiF ideas. I don't have the time and my arthritis cursed wrists can't take the abuse anymore.

3. I've become disenfranchised with the community - This is the one I want to talk about more. However I think it would be lame to go out on a low note like that. Suffice to say there are a large number of people who have not one ounce of apprecation for the amazing things happening in /r/playitforward.

EDIT: Large number may be unfair. The vast majority of members here are incredible and I think the ability and willingness of the community to recognize and not reward scammers is impressive. Any number is more than I'd like to see though and the principal issue is that I can no longer handle being outraged while people attempt to scam some of the kindest and most generous people I've ever met. It literally makes me sick to my stomach and 1 is a larger number than I'd like to see. I'm not talking about those who haven't gifted yet

I think it's probably best to be short and sweet. In closing

Of course gifting to the same people would become circular eventually and we encourage you to pay it ""forward"" so don't feel pressured to give the game to somebody with a badge.

The badge will show up on the front page of /r/playitforward as well as in the comments. If there are any questions or complaints

Thanks

These changes will affect all PiFs not reported as complete at the time of this posting and all future PiFs.

**The changes are as follows:**

**PiF Point changes:**

Games that are sold on steam in a bundle (aka packs) **and not sold individually on steam** are now going to be worth just 1 point. 

Examples: Time Gentlemen, Breath of Death VII, The Sega packs, etc.


This change will not affect most bundles like L4D Bundle or complete collections

DLC and such still don't count for points

**The minimum requirements have also changed:**

PiFers must give to users older than 2 months with at least 300 karma to receive points.

So they have to be at least 2 months old AND have at least 300 karma.

The 1 month requirement is no longer working, the PiFer will not receive points for it.

This change will prevent serial requesters using alt accounts just to enter giveaways

This is not meant to punish people

**This is not meant to punish good people**

Edit:
Few things to make more clear as it seems people have missed them: The PiFer won't get a point if the account does not meet the eligibility requirements

As I said this is not meant to punish the good people so in some cases exceptions can be made

**Humble/Indie/Gala Bundles:**
No points are awarded for either side.

I would also like to thank everyone who entered. I really appreciate all of you who spent a considerable amount of time and effort on your stories. Before I announce the winner

1. I checked out your Reddit history
2. I took note of your Reddit account age and combined karma (how that factored into my decision
3. I checked to see if you had ever given out any games or if you had already won games from other PiFs as well as checking what those games were (made a significant impact on my choice)
4. I read your story and noted how much time I felt you probably spent on it and if I actually liked the story (played a smaller role in my decision
5. I checked out your Steam account to see which games you already own as well as how many games you actually have on your account (slight impact on choice) 
6. I checked to see if you actually played the games you won from other PiFs (if applicable

I compiled all of these factors onto a spreadsheet where I could better compare each entrant side by side. By far, I would get you all Skyrim, but sadly I do not.

I apologize if you feel that he won based on his ratio, but believe me when I say that I spent hours over these past few days trying to figure out who would win.

**I’m thinking about stepping down as a moderator**

While I really liked the PlayItForward subreddit, but wasn’t this the point of this subreddit? To receive a game and then PiF the same game back to the community when you had the chance? Even if you didn’t enjoy the game, you could at least PiF a game that you actually liked. If I could change things, this is what I would change…

**Be prepared

**I would make the flair ratio a different way:**

1.	Number of PiFs a person has started (or what I’d like to call “PiF Chains”)
2.	Number of games a person has received
3.	Number of games a person has played forward

*Wait, let’s say today I was to start a PiF of Dungeon Defenders. Did I receive Dungeon Defenders from someone else? No, so this would be a new PiF chain.

The second category is self explanatory; it’s the number of PiFs the person has won.

The third number is the number of games the person has continued a PiF chain for. If Person A were to give Person B a game like Cave Story+, let’s say that Person B didn’t like Cave Story+ and instead wants to PiF a different game. Simple, in his PiF thread, he would just have to indicate that his PiF was inspired after he won Cave Story+ from Person A. The only catch would be that the game must be of the same category and Person B would have to have owned the game with at least some game time in it. Otherwise, it would count as a new PiF chain and the PiF point would be added in the first category.

*What would be the point of doing this?* I think this subreddit is broken in that the users only see the quantity of games sent out and received. I believe it would benefit if we were able to assess the quality of the PiFs as well.

Consider the following example

Each user would have to link their Reddit account to their Steam account.

The subreddit is broken in that someone can make an alternative account and we would never know it. Last Saturday

It would be nice if we could somehow manage this by talking to the mods over at r/TF2Trade to see how they did their flairs. The Steam Community URL would be placed next to the ratio. We would also have a separate spreadsheet with every user on r/PlayItForward along with their SteamRep details.

*Why use SteamRep?* There are multiple URLs a person can use to get to a single Steam profile. SteamRep seems to be able to gather all the URLs. If a user were to try and make an alternative account

**The subreddit would be invitation only.**

Don’t get me wrong

What about people making new Reddit accounts along with new Steam accounts? When requesting an invitation to join the subreddit

What constitutes as a low value Steam account? Any Steam accounts that only contain games from Indie Bundles would constitute as a low value Steam account. I think it would be fair that a requirement of at least 5 games outside of the Indie Bundles would be fair. It would be nice if there were a way to automate the process

**Users would be warned earlier when they have negative ratios.**

Currently, when issuing a warning, one PM should be sent to the person from the mods. The mods should also notify the other mods that a warning has been given out. One warning should suffice and unless the person violates the warning, no other action should be taken so there is no need to get other people to harass the guy to illustrate your point, one warning is enough. If the person continues to enter PiFs after the warning, that user will be banned. Users may appeal a ban, but only by doing a PiF of their own that directly continues a PiF chain. Proof will be needed and a mod may act as a middleman if need be.

*How would a mod act as a middleman?* If a person who was banned is serious about their appeal

*Why go through this middleman process?* I’m sure we all remember when people from 4chan decided to pay a visit to our subreddit and troll the community. This measure would help prevent that from happening. A screenshot of the gift in your inventory doesn’t mean you’re actually going to send it out when your PiF has concluded.

Back to the negative three game limit I discussed earlier

**Individual games as well as game packs would count as one PiF point each.**

I am honestly so sick and tired of people playing forward game packs they got for cheap and getting multiple PiF points for them. For example, but I think this is the cheapest way to manipulate your ratio. Also, game packs that are not always available would not be eligible to PiF. It would make it almost impossible for the receiver to continue the PiF chain for a pack that was only available for a limited amount of time. Sure, you could argue the person could PiF every single game individually, but the packs are so much cheaper.

Again, but is up against another person who decided to PiF a Cthulhu Saves the World &amp; Breath of Death VII Double Pack earlier. Let’s say that his competition has his flair at [2–2]. Who do you think the person hosting the PiF is going to choose if he had to choose between the two? Assuming the host had no prior knowledge to the first person’s PiF of Skyrim, he would probably most likely choose the guy with the [2–2] flair. Had the game pack been worth only one point, the guy who played forward Skyrim would stand a better chance at [1–1] against the guy who would now be [1–2].


**Humble Indie Bundles

These bundles are “Pay-What-You-Want” for the most part (Indie Royale requires you to beat the minimum) and if you cannot even spare a dollar for a Humble Indie Bundle

In regard to Steam keys

*What about people who want to give those things away?* Let me get to my next point.

**Introduce a new subreddit for people who just want to give out games and keys for free.**

Pretty self-explanatory. Anything users wish to give away for the sake of giving to others should go into a completely different subreddit. I know there are people who give away their extra Steam/Desura keys from the Humble Bundles on r/PlayItForward

**This concludes my rant.**

*What are your thoughts?*

If these changes could somehow be implemented

**TL;DR:**

**This is what upsets me about the subreddit:**

* Alternate accounts are currently easy to create without getting caught
* The quality of the games being played forward are not that good due to people just wanting to get their ratios up
* Not many people are actually playing forward the games they actually win and instead go for cheaper options
* No way to track who actually plays forward the games they win
* Game packs counting as multiple points is currently a cheap way to manipulate your flair into having a positive ratio

**Here are some suggestions I had:**

* Invitation only subreddit; users request an invitation from the mods in order to get in
* Reddit account tied to Steam account and Steam account readily available in flair (like in r/TF2Trade)
* New ratio: [Number of PiF chains started – Number of PiFs won – Number of PiF chains continued]
* Game packs would only count as one PiF chain to stop a cheap way of gaining a positive ratio

(**POSSIBLY MONDAY MORNING** I mean

Now. I've been thinking. Every PiF thread I see has about a billion people just doing the bare minimum to get a free game. I don't dig that. I don't dig it at all. 

All of the games I will be PiFfing tonight are Great. some of them have been on sale lately

So here is the deal. 

In this Particular PiF

Neither game is particularly new, Kids. Neither is Skyrim. 

Please write, or sad about it. I want to know.  GRAMMAR MATTERS. (People who have english as a second language, don't worry, I'll take that into account.)

TWO people are going to win

Please make sure to include your Steam Profile in your answer. If you have one of these mystery games, and soon I'll just be broke like the rest of you.) 


Hopefully this idea is sound and good

 
**Edit** You can enter all three of my PiF's

**EDIT OF THE OH SHIT VARIETY!** I added a third game to this PiF. It's still secret. and it's still not skyrim.(Carry On)

**The This PiF Is Effectively Over, but I'm gonna cap this one off now. 

Lcrbeattie, I realized that I'd kinda have to choose who got what. So Once all three of them have accepted their games, I'll post what the games actually are! 


**THE REVEAL EDIT!!** 

Sorry guys

here they are!

Xzhobo walked away with The Elder Scrolls 3 - Morrowind - A lot of people think this is the best game in the series

I have been highly disappointed in the lack of quality AAA titles in PlayItForward recently. It really seems like everyone wants to give away the cheap stuff in the hope of getting the good stuff later on. Change starts with us

Edit: I may have chosen my words badly. I understand that games like HL2 and their kin are incredible values and AAA titles in their own right. Perhaps i was being too hasty in my judgement. I just want to get people some games they REALLY want before they're $10 dime-in-a-dozen specials. It's so sweet to get a game you can't afford!

To be eligible for this PiF

I reserve the right to change my mind on winners if I don't consider them fit for winning.

Lastly, be grateful. Tell me something about yourself.

There will be 5 separate winners.

I will choose the winners in stages over the weekend. Sunday is the earliest it will be over

**Original**: Hello everyone. I'm with Arcen Games

What we're giving away

**Steam Titles**

You can grab our deep space strategy title [AI War](http://store.steampowered.com/app/40400) and any/all of its DLC for 75% off through December 31st (even more savings if you go with the Alien Bundle which is everything together.) Not only that but it has a featured achievement Steam users can unlock to earn and win more stuff through the current [The Great Gift Pile treasure hunt event](http://store.steampowered.com/holidaysale) running in conjunction with the huge sale.

Our unique puzzler [Tidalis](http://store.steampowered.com/app/40420/) is 80% off on Steam as well. If you're into deep block-based puzzling (note: not match-3) for $2 instead of $10


Additionally

All Steam sales end January 2

**Non-Steam Titles**

Our in-development sprawling 2D sidescroller [A Valley Without Wind](http://www.arcengames.com/w/index.php/avww-buy) is available for pre-order now through our site at 50% off the launch price (at the moment it's $10 as opposed to $20.)  You can also grab it on MacGamesStore, but if/when it does arrive the licence key you'll receive will work to activate the game on Valve's client.


If you'd like to try any of these games you can find the AI War demo [here](http://www.arcengames.com/w/index.php/aiwar-downloads), though I believe that those are just the PC versions.

How you can participate in the giveaway:


Per request I'll be giving out the keys by asking in the comments for a number between such and such, figure out the winners, and deliver the licence keys to their inboxes.


We'll be adding extra keys to the drawing as we reach various milestones in upvotes, as this post accumulates more points and entries, I'll add in extra keys and draw additional winners for them accordingly.


If you do end up picking up [AI War](http://reddit.com/r/aiwar) or [A Valley Without Wind](http://reddit.com/r/avww) during the sale/giveaway


Thanks everyone and best of luck. Happy new year as well!

Love

**Edit**: An amendment to the rules above as wisely suggested by Reddit user cyantist. The reasoning is good enough for me:

*I want to encourage you to run the random number generator until you get a hit, 15 for a chance to win AI War, why then should 14 get a 1/81 chance of winning and 13 and 15 have more than that?*

*Why should people who post later get better chances? (Due to the fact that they can choose numbers relative to those who have already posted.)*",,t5_2s4e5,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward/comments/nyq28/happy_new_year_rplayitforward_we_have_a_few/

1357779159.0,16a80s,[PSA] Points aren't working.,sevenalive,51,10,81,"The points have been around for over a year now. I'm not blind and I do read and hear the complaints that come along with it.

I created the system to solve the problems at the time. I would say for the most part it has been a success

The whole reason this subreddit exists is for people to receive and play the game. Something that is lost on a lot of people. This subreddit has basically turned into steamgifts with a much better chance of winning.

Everything else aside

Those who enter to win games for which they want but can't play for months aren't getting much sympathy from me. I rather have the game go to someone who will play it now

The other issue is people think they can buy Breath of Death VII and Cthulhu saves the World and get 2 points for $3. They aren't giving away that game because they like it

There are so many PWYW bundles

The points have turned into a clusterfuck to put it bluntly. Before the points, they don't keep track of counts.

This is where you come in. The points are going to be going away

The problems that need solving:

* Hit and Run users. They get as many games as they can before deleting their account or just leaving the subreddit.

* The Traders: Those who want your game to use as currency to get another game.

* The people who buy the cheapest stuff they can to avoid the ratio limits.

* The people who never play the game.

* Those who don't give back.

* PWYW bundles. Count them or don't this is a problem either way.

--

So what's the solution? I want to know what you would do. You can forget all of the current rules

I previously thought of something similar to steamgifts. Instead games are given a point amount based on avg sale price

Another idea was to limit the games received to 1. You receive 1 game or bundle

--

Whatever the case

Edit: I should note going by steam's playtime and/or achievements aren't practical and easily faked.

Edit 2: A lot of people don't know about [this](http://imgur.com/a/tveVa#1)

Also it's a good idea to look at the spreadsheet for your potential winners to see what games they received. There have been cases where a person won 2 copies of the same game. Yes receiving a game and then giving it to someone else (not in a PiF), or doing anything else like that is against the rules and a ban-able offense.

So

The winner will be allowed to have any number of games purchased for themselves totalling **£35 at the most**. Currency converters currently state that around $56

STEAM prices aren't quite done with a currency converter though

The rule to enter and win this is quite simply:

**I want to know why gaming is important to you** 

The reason I judge ""best"" by my own standards will be picked as a winner at 23:59 BST(GMT+1) tomorrow (13/05/12). I will probably reject a very poorly written one.

If BST confuses you

Oh

**EDIT** With 24 hours to go before I have to make my decision, I didn't mean to. I'm feeling a little terrible about asking this question right now though, because I feel like I'm judging some people's lives. I just want everyone to know that I'm not judging your reason, I'm looking for the person who I think is most honest about themselves.

Please note that my reply doesn't mean to have any affect on who I will choose.

* Enter chat room **whenever there is an announcement** that indicates the game is starting.  It will be at a random time almost daily to give everyone a chance at participating. (The announcement should pop up in your steam so you will not miss it if you are online and have joined the group)
* Once you are in group chat
* When it is your turn
* If you are able to get to the end of the text adventure you win.

Now. I've been thinking. Every PiF thread I see has about a billion people just doing the bare minimum to get a free game. I don't dig that. I don't dig it at all.

All of the games I will be PiFfing tonight are Great. some of them have been on sale lately

So here is the deal.

In this Particular PiF

One of these games is Old, and colourful, and puzzly, and I probably just gave it away! Both of them are pretty laid back. 

I love both of them. 

TWO people will win a game in this PiF.  To win

I think it's incredibly important... What do you think?

Please include your Steam Account in your response so that I can make sure that I don't gift you a game you've already got. If you write a winning paragraph and you have both games... we'll talk. 


Good luck

Always verify the URL before logging into anything. Password managers like Lastpass make it easy

Enable Steam Guard and make sure your passwords are secure and different. Using the same password for steam as your email easily defeats steam guard and you will lose other accounts.

Giving a game to a specific person where nobody else has a chance to win the game is NOT a PiF. You give away something in chat, you aren't getting a second chance anymore. You will be banned.

Here are some examples:

1325890336.0,o60qq,[Announcement] Please Report Any Suspicious Activity to the Mods,orijinal,46,9,30,"**Please be sure to read the updates to this if you haven't already.**

While going through the entries of my [Skyrim PiF](http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward/comments/o4og0/pif_the_elder_scrolls_v_skyrim/), and I noticed something while checking to see who actually plays the games they win. Some people who won PiFs did not actually own the games they had won. Looking through their user history, I saw that they had kept the game in their Steam Gift inventory and attempted to trade the game in other subreddits. Those users are now banned.

If you are giving out a game, just report it to us and we will investigate the matter.

**While I understand not everyone has the time to research their users

If you are unable to research your entrants

* Make sure the person doesn't already own the game that he or she is trying to win in your PiF
* Private profiles should be viewed as being suspicious when researching your entrants*
* Trade the game to the person **while you are both online** as opposed to sending it as a gift
* Politely ask the person to ""Unpack"" the game immediately after to avoid any doubt that the person will not try and trade the game away
* Keep the person on your friends list and check your Community page to see if ""X now owns Y""

If the person accepts the trade

* A screenshot of the conversation (if possible)
* A screenshot of your Steam Gift Inventory History
* The person's **permanent Steam URL** (see **UPDATE** below)
* A link to the person's Reddit account

If you win a PiF, please send it back rather than hosting your own PiF. Doing a PiF with the same copy of a game that you won from another PiF can be viewed as a manipulation of ratio and is an offense that can result in a ban. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this and I hope this will help. Please feel free to ask any questions. I am more than happy to address any of your concerns.

* *I am not saying that everyone with a private profile is bad, you don't know what games the person already owns nor the number of games the person has and can't find out if the profile is private. The best way to go about this in my opinion is to just ask the person to leave their Steam profile public for the remainder of your PiF or you will not give that person a chance to win.*

Basically I was appointed as a mod and turned this subreddit what it is today. I'm quite proud of the outcome. I think some of our vets remember what is was like before I came on board

Anyway

So far between 12/20/2011 and the time this post was made

---
**It seems many of you have no idea that there is a spreadsheet.** Look at the sidebar, it's called [PiF Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AiFZyanaAvZDdDFNb19TNW1aUGZ0ZFlhaXF2VE1vSmc&amp;hl=en_US/#/pifcss/p/right/c/blue). Anyone can view it. It contains all PiFs reported as complete as well as a watchlist that contains usernames and steam accounts of people who are banned or ineligible to enter due to exceeding the ratio limit.

**Yes there has always been a ratio limit.** I recently added that to the sidebar, so please read that.

On that note
---
We have also changed the flair for users who are ineligible and those who broke the rules and are now banned. Banned = Red flair ""0 - 9 | Banned"" will show up if a user is banned and it will have a red background. 

Orange flair ""0 - 5 | Can't Enter or Win"" - These users have exceeded the ratio limit and thus not allowed to enter or win anymore games until their ratio is .8 or higher. Violating that rule is cause for ban. If you see orange flair accounts entering PiFs

Now the banned guys have been banned from the sub

Users who are warned get a message from us:

&gt;Hello [user]

&gt;We have noticed you have now exceeded the PiF ratio limit put in place

&gt;You are not allowed to enter anymore PiFs until your ratio becomes .8 or better (as per rule #2).
&gt;Any existing entries must be removed. If you enter another PiF after this warning and your ratio is not .8 or better

If that person ignores the warning

TL;DR: New flair for people that are banned or not allowed to enter PiFs until their ratio is improved. Mention of the spreadsheet and sidebar


---
**Edit: Some clarifications:**

If you PiF to an account that is less than 2 months old it will not count for points. Same goes for accounts with less than 300 combined karma. So PiFers will only get points if the receiver is more than 2 months old with at least 300 karma points to qualify for points. It's not either or

Also any account with orange or red flair should not be picked to win and will not count for points if they do. Orange flair saying ""Can't Enter or Win PiFs"" is over the ratio limit and is violating the rules if they enter or win more pifs.

Also again Packs and Bundles count PER GAME. Read the sidebar and the rules please

I am continuing my year of PIF with volume 6! and 
[THIS](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198002004788/inventory) is what you can potentially win!  Also, it was clear that any sort of organization of eight people was next to impossible and nobody ever won anything.  **Also as an aside, if ANYONE has copies of 'The Ship' on steam, I would love to trade for them as I have a great plan on using them in my next giveaway.**

------------------

Here is what happens in this PIF:

* Join my [steam group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/redditgiveaway/)
* Enter chat room **whenever there is an announcement** that indicates the game is starting.  It will be at a random time almost daily to give everyone a chance at participating. (The announcement should pop up in your steam so you will not miss it if you are online and have joined the group)
* Once you are in group chat, wins!

--------------

What happens after the game?

Prizes are given out depending on what you already have, and in small part your reddit history.

------------------

**Special Notes**


* Pif Rules Apply (Karma / Account Age)
* You must not have the game you win
* Before the prize is given
* In light of rule #13 on the sidebar
* The prize list will constantly be modified as trades are made to increase the amount of games I have
* I have RL matters to attend to so the contest may abruptly end at any time.  Although I will try to keep it going for hour long increments.  Thanks for your understanding!
* Last and probably most important

Hopefully there is someone who wants it..


The code for this game comes in 2 parts :

* Players key
* Activation key

I don't really know how you are supposed to get the base installation files

Once again I warn you that **it does not activate on Steam** but surely there is someone who doesn't care and just want to play the game. Or there is someone who has the pirated version and needs a legit copy?

To enter

Also tell me:

1. In short - why you want the game?
2. In case of many entries post a number 1-100

I will pick a winner in few days from now

**TL;DR** You need to find installation .iso yourself, post why you want it and a number 1-100.

2.) Tell me what any Batman character means to you. If Joker is the ideal father (in a twisted sort of way

I joined Reddit on Christmas day last year

So what the hell

Please meet PiF requirements

* Binding of Isaac **x 4**
* Binding of Isaac DLC **x 3**

I played this game on a whim

* Chime

The music in this puzzler lets you achieve a sense of zen

* Civilization 5

This game doesn't need an introduction or to be vouched for. One of the kings of the epic turn-based strategy empire-builders.

* Commandos Collection (Commandos 2: Men of Courage, Commandos: Beyond the Call of Duty)

Classic team-based tactical stealth gameplay. This series was renowned for really pushing that genre forward. There weren't many other games like it

* Company of Heroes
* Company of Heroes Gold (base + Opposing Fronts)

""World War II RTS"" doesn't do this game justice. CoH redefined what it meant to be a real-time strategy game. It added FPS tactics (flanking, squad upgrades and commander abilities made this game feel wholly fresh and utterly unlike the slow burn of Starcraft.

* Hearts of Iron III

But some people like slow. Grand strategy wargamers like to play the logistics battle as much as they do the tactics game

* L4D2 **x 8**

I've got a whopping **eight copies** of this game for you. Remember that you can only ask for copies for yourself - if your friends want a copy

* Portal

The innovative puzzles in this game were matched only by the black humor that spread virally over the internet. It is also renowned as a gateway game

* Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic

I still have trouble explaining why I love this RPG: maybe it was the d20 ruleset, more choice divergence...but this game will always have a special place in my heart.

* World of Goo **x 2**

Because of the large nature of the gift, so I've extended it to the 19th.***

Keep in mind, and be willing to accept the fact that there's a good chance you'll need to do a ton of PiFs to become eligible to receive games again. I do expect the person who wins this to PiF, although obviously not all at once. (And not necessarily the Valve complete pack either - any games are fine.)

There may be other rules or conditions that I want people to abide by that I've simply forgotten. If I remember them

Anyway, I have come up with a new way of reporting PiFs completed, which should help during the PiF holiday season.

On the sidebar
That button will take you to a google form to fill out the needed info. You can add up to 16 users for a single PiF. 

If a user has won more than one game

PiFers are the only people who should be filling out the form. Leave ununsed fields blank. So if you only pifed to 1 user, like guestpasses, beta keys, dlc.

This system will be used until the new pif app is finished

If you have any questions

Disclaimer: Game is subject to change if I somehow run out of games people have said.

Edit: I also noticed that some of the gifts I have are not from the autumn sale

Edit 2: for clarification I will be giving away one each day so a total of 9 games should be given out. the reason I say I have 30 gift-able games is because I have that many possible giveaways

* Day 2: Pudie Received Bastion!

* Day 3: hadzic Received Left 4 Dead 2!

My supposed friend told me he had keys from those cheap that he directly got from a wholesaler and since he's a gameshop owner and a trusted friend (well 

I sold quite a good number of them and after discovering this subreddit I decided to give some away cause it looked like a good community (and it is !). First I gave away one

Then some weeks ago 

I contacted my 'friend' right away and he assured me the keys didn't come from there. Since he was a trusted friend I still believed him 

A week passed and since no one talked about that forum I thought it was okay and just started giving some away. Then 1 or two days ago 

Then today I wake up and I see those two posts on PlayItForward telling about those keys. I was pretty sure at this point that my friend was fucking me the whole time but I still believed that he may be legit a bit. I payed him a visit and then he told me that the keys in fact comes from fkn0wned but he can't give me my money back since he's pretty broke and all that shit.

Since then I managed to go in touch with some known members from this forum. The keys are legit (I dunno how they got them , I can assure that.

So yeah I'm feeling pretty shitty now

Keep in mind most of the money I got to make the PiFes came from the selling of those keys. Now that it's impossible to sell them I have no income source anymore apart from the 20€ of pocket money I get each month (Yeah I'm still a 19year-old student that lives with his parent and only gets pocket money ~_~ ) so until I find another thing to sell to make me some money my PiFes are going to be much more limited and I apologise in advance for that.

So yeah

For some context

In order to be eligible to receive the account you must:

* not be a new member (I'm not going to give this to a week old account)

* have done a PIF of your own (given away a game)

* agree to add something to the account and pass it on at the end of Feb.


I will leave this up for about 24 hours and pick from the responses.  Please read the rules and provide some evidence with your response that you are eligible.  Good luck to all.  This thing is still new but let's keep it going because it's a cool idea.

EDIT: [Here is the account page](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198034457257).  Currently it has Amnesia (downneck), and Shatter (me - cause I'm a cheap bastard).  If anyone else would like to donate to the account I'm sure the future owners would appreciate it, and it could also be a way to become eligible for the account yourself.

We noticed that an abuse of our system was occurring with people creating alternate accounts and just waiting for two months in order to use them to enter numerous PiFs. Others have gotten more deceitful by deleting their past PiF entries in order to mask that they are serial requesters. I'm sure the community wouldn't want a bunch of alternate accounts created like this entering all the PiFs people are creating. After this rule was implemented a while back

Thanks so much for being a part of the PiF community. We're now over 2
  
As everyone knows, and we'd like your input. We've noticed a few things that make us raise our eyebrows:  
  
* There are some *brand* new accounts that pop up and do a valid PiF on a low-cost game which makes us wonder whether they're just laying the ground work to continually request. These accounts generally only have activity in this sub at the time of account creation.   
2. Related to #1 above we have seen some accounts do a low-cost PiF and then serially request games. This is hard to police because 10 requests might lead to no games
3. There has also been a rise in PiF-ing low cost mobile games
  
Anyway

1. Should we make badges harder to obtain? If so
2. Should length of reddit membership play a role? This helps the fight against accounts committed to requesting
3. Should we have two levels of badges? If we go this route, multiple PiFs, certain length of account, etc.).   
4. Should cheap mobile games count towards a badge? What about super cheap Steam games, but my word/belief may not be in line with the community.  
  
So, as a side not regarding whatever we do with badges, they are not granted immediately, but will usually come within a week of whatever criteria we ultimately decide. Thanks everyone!

* You can suggest more games for me play forward
* You can ask for up to three games

[**Fate of the World**](http://www.desura.com/games/fate-of-the-world) It's a management simulator. It's also a look at the various crises that could affect people in the next couple hundred years. It's depressing

[**Frozen Synapse**](http://store.steampowered.com/app/98200/) A turn-based tactical shooter. The interesting part is that both players give orders to their troops, it reminds me of the 1994 board game, [Robo-Rally](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/18/roborally) which is a personal favorite of mine.  

[**Garry's Mod**](http://store.steampowered.com/app/4000/) Physics sandbox in Valve's Source engine. You can do and make whatever your want. Honestly, giant rube goldberg machines, medieval siege weaponry, and that is just the tip of the iceberg. Interesting footnote: the creator got into a bidding war with Notch on one of the humble bundles for top donation.  

[**Gratuitous Space Battles**](http://store.steampowered.com/app/41800/), and start the battle. The AI takes control of both sides, and you get to watch the pretty explosions. It's interesting. They've taken the exciting part of strategy games, and made a game solely based around that. At the same time, by removing the player from the actual battle, we have a game where skill isn't remotely tied to micromanagement or ""clicks per minutes"", and no player can use movement related exploits to gain an advantage.  

[**Hydrophobia: Prophecy**](http://store.steampowered.com/app/92000/) A 3rd-person cover based shooter where emphasis is placed on water-filled environments. That statement doesn't make it sound appealing, but it was unique. 

[**Grotesque Tactics: Evil heroes**](http://store.steampowered.com/app/46450/) as recommended [in this comment below](http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward/comments/wbg6h/pif_various_indie_games_in_alphabetical_order/c5bxuk3) by DizzyEevee.

I had a lot of fun with my last PiF (the grab bag surprise.) And I'll be honest, bad rats... and thinking 'God. nobody is going to take that game. Ever. 

So I sweetened up the deal with some other games that I genuinely enjoyed

Now i'm kind of interested in doing something like that again (I've got an inventory full of games that I really enjoy

BUT

But to do what's best for the community

So to you

Would you prefer I space out my generosity? or are you alright with big give-aways (when I can afford them) and silly gimmicks like not knowing what games you might get?

Hi everyone!  My [previous PIF](http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward/comments/o0jav/pif_possibly_the_biggest_steam_giveaway_contest/) ended up being a little underwhelming due to a lack of participation and attendance.  That being said

I have decided that 2012 will be the year of PIF.  I will do one PIF on the first and fifteenth of every month for the rest of 2012.  What is up for grabs?  [ALL OF THIS!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0An9wNJsgKPBYdDdtQTZ3ZV94ekI4QUZIX3AtVkxtUmc&amp;hl=en_US#gid=0)

Here is what you need to do for this PIF.  Anyone who beats me in a one on one match of [Cultris 2](http://gewaltig.net/cultris2.aspx) will win a game from that list

How do you participate?

* Join my [steam group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/redditgiveaway/)
* Enter chat room.  (If I am in there
* Make sure your name in-game is the same as steam
* Once your number is called
* One win per 24 hour period.  If you lose

You can watch the livestream of the games [here](http://www.livestream.com/ishikaro).

Each game lasts around 90 seconds so the wait time will not be that bad.  You can download the game from [here](http://gewaltig.net/cultris2.aspx) as well as play online right from your browser!

I'm not sure if both people entering should fit into PIF rules. May be top comment only is enough. But this is up to the mods. 

Also it might be wise to mention your buddy's reddit name in the comment to avoid confusion.

Feel free to post multiple sentences if you like, but have them be separated by at least one other person's response.

Rules and stuff:  


* You shouldn't be a scammer or a serial requester. I will not give any game to suspicious accounts. Newly created accounts (&lt; 3 months) or accounts with low activity have a low chance of winning. People who have made their own PiFs have a better chance. People with positive ratios have the highest chance.  
* You shouldn't have an orange or red flair by the time I'm picking the winners.  
* You can enter for multiple games.  
* Include your steamid in your comment like this: [http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198003923806](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198003923806)
* I'd prefer to give the packs &amp; bundles to someone whose ratio wouldn't be hurt too bad. This is not written in stone though
* I will make a list of every single user who entered
* Winners will be sent their games when we are both online on steam.  
* Tell me which game you're entering for
* (Optional) Make a comment about the game you're entering for. This can be one or two sentences. An interesting comment will increase your chance of winning as well.     


I will keep this running for about a week. Probably more if not every game gets picked by someone eligible.



**Please note that the games in bundles and packs cannot be given separately, steam does not allow this.**  

**DOWNVOTING ENTRIES WHO ASKED FOR THE SAME GAME AS YOU DID WILL ONLY MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO WIN. I WILL GO THROUGH EVERY SINGLE COMMENT BEFORE CLOSING THE THREAD

Also I'm not sure many people realize the restrictions of these coupons. They only can be used until after the sale and can't be used for any games released after the sale. It's only good for 3 months. Almost all of the sale deals are better than the coupons. So people are better off buying the game during the holiday sale

As for the humble bundles

Also a reminder

Hope that makes sense. Happy Holidays!

Unfortunately, probably indefinitely. As you may or may not know I have arthritis in both my wrists and I'm an independent developer so my time available to projects is very limited. I think the steam and game gifting communities needed something like this, and steamgifts.com got there quicker.

*Part 2.*  
So many questions - all things I'm considering doing
*What am I allowed to do?*  

* If I gave away a couple copies of the potato sack or similar bundle with extras
* If I give away a game that has TF2 pre-order items, but on the other, it means that the recipient can't try and profit from selling them.
* I know that you can enter for a friend as long as you name them, or no?
* Are solving logic puzzles asking too much as an entry? What about asking people to leave a reddit PM to a friend of mine

*What are you guys up to?*  

* Is there going to be another event for the steam summer sale like the candy canes for the steam christmas sale?
* Do you want some 18 x 18 images done up for it?
* Pif seems to be a pre-fix, and occasionally a adjective. No specific question, but any comments?
* Do you have a list of your top 50 contributors or something? Or even a list of redditors with flair. It'd make my life a little easier
* What do people want to see in a pif? I've browsed the top posts
* In a similar vein, Bastion and Fortix, but what else are people tired of seeing?
* There are recent completed pifs with less than 5 upvotes. What's up with that?
* Did the flair used to have a black border around it

So we seem to be short a few mods right now which is unfortunate since we have a lot of work to do. We're looking for a couple of you to become 
moderators to help us lighten the workload. Modding this community is a hard job and you will find that you're putting about 10-15 hours of your 
time in to it each week.

Your job will be to help check the spreadsheet and then assign the flair for each user. You'll need to check to make sure that they meet both the
karma and age requirement and that they haven't exceeded the .8 ratio. You'll also be checking for new accounts or people using alternate accounts. 
It would also be nice to see you in the PIF steam chat but it's not really required.


If you think you can do that then reply with a bit about yourself and why you want to be a moderator. Please ensure that your ratio is positive and only apply if you're sure that you can put the time in to managing the community.",,t5_2s4e5,False,,cube,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward/comments/qhs0r/want_to_be_a_moderator_then_apply_here/

I'm not always playing it forward but I visit this subreddit everyday to read through the submissions and the comments so I have a sense of what the subreddit is like. 

I just wanted to remind people that this sub is not about getting free games. It is about people sharing games that they love with other people who are willing to share back. 

This is not a place to come and ask for free games or to keep taking free games without giving back to the community. 

If you are interested in just getting free games without the sharing portion please visit /r/randomactsofgaming or /r/giftofgames. In this subreddit it is expected that once you receive a game you will eventually gift that game or another game of your choice to someone else to keep the good times going.

I just had a really shitty week. My redditor of an ex gf dumped me today as an early birthday gift, and now this whole ex gf deal. 

So to stop myself from further sinking into anger and self pity, I'm giving away a copy of Penny Arcade's On the Rain Slick Precipice of Darkness 3 to a lucky PiFer. It'll be delivered as a Steam gift.

The usual PiF rules apply. My only condition for this PiF is that you go hug some one you love. Your partner, your friend, your cat, your dog. I don't care who, just hug them. I will close this giveaway on my birthday, Sunday July 8th and choose some one randomly via random.org. If I pass out early on Sunday, then I will draw a winner on the Monday instead.

Mods: I will provide proof of my real Reddit account if required for the PiF.

Edit: I had a derp moment. Please remember to post your Steam ID so I can send you the game.

Second Edit: I just wanted to say thank you. The outpouring of support has almost brought me to tears a few times. Which is saying a lot since I haven't even shed one yet through out this whole ordeal and I'm usually a cry my eyes out in private sort of guy (not ashamed to admit I cry though!). Hopefully I have some extra cash next pay check because I'm definitely putting up another game here to to say thank you to a kick ass subreddit community.

So, moments with audio design, or simply listening to 80s metal when you were playing Halo 2.

This is not like other subreddits where moderators basically just handle spam. If you aren't prepared to spend 15 hours or so a week on the subreddit

* Respond to mod messages promptly
* Edit the spreadsheet following the template
* Edit pif points according the rules provided in the sidebar.
* Enter threads and check for scammers
* Need a google account and uses google talk.
* Google Docs and spreadsheet experience. I really don't want to train someone on how to use the spreadsheet. You will need to know how to make pretty hyperlinks like in the sheet. It's not hard but it takes some time to get used to it.
* If you become inactive for long periods of time

Post steam ID and say what game you want

Tell me about the first game that made you stay up all night.  The one you couldn't stop playing no matter what was happening the next day.  Say why they game grabbed you like no other game had before.  I want some freaking nostalgia. Your nostalgia is not required to be as old as mine :D

Here is mine:

Ultima 7 - 1995.  My god, if you slept too long your back would ache.  It was the most emersive gaming experience of my 15 year old life.  Loved the part of the game was when I discovered you could kill the banker get the key and rob the bank and she came back the next day!  And the flying carpet! I found it without the internet!  I stayed up until I couldn't keep my eyes open another second and woke up the next morning and got going again.  Took me 7 full days, morning to night to beat that game.

**EDIT:**
Awsome stories guys! I really enjoyed reading about your gaming nostalgia.
Seriously I wish I could Pif to all of you.

With the summer sale [almost certainly starting tomorrow](http://i.imgur.com/UM7RXpQ.png) and me in a rare position of being able to get more games than I can probably play I would like to do a PiF.

1. Post the name of a single game you want which can be purchased on Steam that you think will be on special sale.*

2. Do not edit your post after creating it. If your post has been edited after the sales are announced it will void your entry.


**How to win:**

1. Tomorrow, up to 30 dollars worth of winners.

If no one should pick a ""winning"" game or if Steam should change the way they do sales and there's no special sales deals this year I will choose winners at random

* **Special sale** - Pretty much everything is guaranteed to be on some sort of ""sale

I know it's kind of a complicated way to do this but doing it this way gets us more bang for the buck, right?

I've HEARD that bioshock has a great ending (don't tell me!). With this in mind

Your alternate ending should NOT spoil the original in any way! So, I wouldn't write ""Frodo doesn't destroy the ring, Middle Earth ends"", because that kind of gives away that Frodo does, in fact, destroy the ring. Likewise, I wouldn't write ""Pretty much the same except Character X survives"" because that gives away that Character X doesn't actually survive.

I've got some Games to PiF! Wooo! 

**Game Three: Return of the Game** [Burnout Paradise: Ultimate Collection!](http://store.steampowered.com/app/24740/) 

This is a game about driving cars on a largish island

I love this game. 

**The Rulez**  
  Read the Sidebar rules. This PiF is only open to eligible Redditors. I don't particularly care about points

1. Upvote this thread for visibility. 


2. [Link](http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ceebsies/) me your steam ID. **[LINK](http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ceebsies/)**   
link - http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ceebsies/

3. Tell me about your absolute worst Car experience that isn't horrible. (I do not want to hear about the time that you killed your friend while drunk driving.)   
If you don't have a license, so make sure to go the extra mile!  

4. I will have my girlfriend, and choose a winner. It's like reddit raffle, but less random!

5. Check back in two days. This PiF will be completed on Wednesday Evening around 10 pm PST.

I edited this contest two days ago to reflect that I would be delayed in posting the write-ups of the battle royale. Somehow it didn't go through!

Okay, I have made some notes and charts, and I've determined the winners. I just don't have the fight details posted yet.

To avoid spoilers, folks!

Please stay tuned for the details

**CONTEST IS CLOSED**

We actually had a winner for the lesser of the guess-the-number prizes tonight. **antrino** will get his pick of Bit.Trip Beat or Cogs. Incidentally

So we had nine entrants, but you won this drawing as well. We won't be seeing good ol' Stonewall Jackson in this battle.

That business aside

* Alexander the Great
* Abraham Lincoln

-

* Sun Tzu
* Steve Jobs

+

* Wyatt Earp
* Genghis Khan

-

* Jeanne d'Arc
* Simo Hayha (sorry

I'll finish all three rounds tomorrow and will announce a winner by July 28th 11PM CST.

---

Contest flavor aside

* **A number between 1-1000**. This enters you for the mystery prize
* **An historical figure. Any historical figure.** This determines who wins
* **Your Steam profile**. Not your name

The prizes include:

* **Champion**: Your choice of the [Wolf Pack](http://store.steampowered.com/sub/418/) (worth three points) or [Mafia (1)](http://store.steampowered.com/app/40990/).
* **Runner-Up**: Whichever of the two above games was not chosen.
* **Guess the magic number!**: Win the secret prize: your pick of my Steam Inventory. What's inside? *IT'S A MYSTERY*. This number will also be used in other ways.
* **Your guessed number counts twice!** I've created a second secret number for this PiF only. If you guess *this one*

Also

This contest will close tomorrow, when this post is 24 hours old.

---

So just like last time, the runner-up will receive whichever game is left.

Entries that don't make it into the tournament for whatever reason (probably something to do with fair ladders requiring 2^n participants) will still be given a chance at a **GRAND FABULOUS PRIZE** simply by guessing a number.

I'll randomly choose sixteen (probably) entries, in a variety of exotic locales and dangerous scenarios! I'll determine who fights whom, unless there's a popular request. After the ladder's drawn up, these characters will face off regardless of allegiance or chronology. Then, I'll determine the winner via presumably arbitrary means. Know this: each fight will be at least somewhat fair.

After that, until there are only two. This final battle will receive a bit more detail, but I'll describe each fight at least a little. If you'd like to contest the results of a given battle, I welcome you to submit a complaint to someone who cares.

Stay tuned for further contests with similar guidelines! Next theme: legends and myths!

Here's what we're going to do: I hate doing random number generation, really, really like consumer products.  Make a post about your favorite product *that you own*.  Please include a picture (ones from Google are acceptable) and a brief description about why it's your favorite.  The person that I think makes the best case for their choice will be declared the winner.

Here are some ground rules:

1. The product has to be tangible.
2. The product has to be inedible.
3. The product cannot be a sex toy or sex-related.  I really don't want to read a bunch of smart-ass answers about dildos and fleshlights and how they make you feel good. (I know
4.  Focus on the form of the product.  I'm trying to get an idea of how the product's aesthetic affects your perception of it
5. Be critical and observant.  Saying you like something because it looks cool is a bad answer because it tells me nothing.

So those are the rules.  I'll leave it open 5:00 PM EST on Sunday, and then I will contact them via PM and give them their game.

Happy hunting


EDIT:  So I've looked through all of the responses, I narrowed it down to three.  It was really interesting to me to see that even though I specifically wrote that I wanted to hear about the form of the product, I got a lot of answers that detailed function instead.  qzmpwxni's response was the only one that openly addressed the product's aesthetic and how it affects his perception of the product as well as of people who own it.

1339861823.0,v53mx,[PIF] Various Indie games in alphabetical order. Today: A &amp; B.,Pif-alphabetically,30,6,68,"Ok. There's two parts to this
  
**Part 1.** I've been lurking here for a *long* time now, and when the occasional drama occurs, there's a happy ending and it often feels like /r/justiceporn. But, I don't think that games are given proper consideration when played forward. There's a lot of games that are piffed(?) because they were free gifts, heavily discounted, or just popular. Don't misunderstand me - I love that fact that you're giving away games here, sharing the love instead of trying to turn a profit - as I see so often in /r/steamgameswap.   

For me
I will go through the alphabet, and listing what I like/ is interesting about them.  But, I don't know every game, and if you can tell me about an indie game that you like - I just may add it to the list of games I'm playing forward. This will mainly be a steam/gog/desura thing.  

**Part 2.** Does your name start with today's letters, so we can have a conversation and I can find out what games/genres you're interested in.  


**Today's Games.** A &amp; B. This list isn't complete, and tell me why the game is interesting. I'll only give each game out if 3 or more people want it. **You can request up to three games,** and I only say that because I hate it when someone says ""I'll take all the left overs"". There are no left-overs. With the exception of APOX, I haven't bought any of these yet. Leave your steam ID in your comment, too.

[**APOX**](http://store.steampowered.com/app/80000/). A RTS where the units can act intelligently according to the situation. They can swap active weapons, you may not have much fun with it. But this game takes a step in the right direction into giving versatility to the units. I think they succeeded in that.  

[**Avernum Great Trials trilogy**](http://store.steampowered.com/sub/14583/) Spiderweb software continue to make isometric squad-based RPGs. That's their niche market. It's nice to see someone continue to make a genre of game that most companies have discrard or revamped so much that they're barely recognizable as such. With each game released they continue to improve their game engine - and that is where the controversy lies. Jeff Vogel's detractors say that he just makes the same game over and over. And that is why I'm playing forward the trilogy - so you can see for yourself and make up your own mind.  

[**Atom Zombie Smasher**](http://store.steampowered.com/app/55040/) It is like a tower defense without the skinner boxing. Your mission is to rescue as many civilians from an area of city that has a zombie outbreak. All the units on the ground are tiny pinpricks of light, and the civilians generally move towards the pick-up point. As a general rule, I'd prefer not to give out games from the humble indie bundles, but it's been a long time since HiB3. 

[**Beat Hazard**](http://store.steampowered.com/app/49600/) It's a combination of bullet hell, a mode where you play an album (which is how some music is MEANT to be heard), supports a lot of file types, &amp; a levelling system which is fairly quick to get through - meaning that it isn't a ""Level-up to win"" game (and oh, how I despise those games).  

[**Analogue: A Hate Story**](http://store.steampowered.com/app/209370/) I'll let Alec Meer of Rockpapershotgun.com [tell you about it instead of me](http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/02/29/wot-i-think-analogue-a-hate-story/).  

[**Bob came in pieces**](http://store.steampowered.com/app/46000/) A puzzle game (I like puzzle games, where you needed to know what to do from the start of the level. Thus, the game encourages thinking and experimentaion, which is very interesting.  

[**Binding of Isaac**](http://store.steampowered.com/app/113200/)  As recommended [in this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward/comments/v53mx/pif_various_indie_games_in_alphabetical_order/c51qg1k). I may give out the dlc if someone wants that instead.

**BIT.TRIP.BEAT** As recommended [in this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward/comments/v53mx/pif_various_indie_games_in_alphabetical_order/c51p51j)  

**Games I'm not playing forward**  
Braid, Auditorium is in the current royale bundle, and The Ball, AaaaaAAaaaAAA... and audiosurf were in last week's potato sack. I'm not here to give away games that are extremely cheap at the moment. Go to /r/steamgameswap or similar if you're interested.

All I ask is that the recipient play Shadow of Chernobyl until he or she gets to 100 Rads bar. I think by that point the player will have both learned what the game expects and have gotten over the worst of the learning curve. When I first played it

1. To support indie developers.    

2. To play-forward great games other redditors may not have had the chance to play
 
  
The great thing about the above two purposes is that they work so well together. Many individuals often don't ever hear about a great indie game, indie game studios and redditors both benefit.   
  
Based on the above information

+ Someone offering to purchase a game for another redditor or redditors.  

+ The game in question is from an independent developer (or multiple games are offered

Posts with the following characteristics are great and we support them

+ Offering to give a game away that you already own.  

+ Offering to give away game/CD keys.    

+ Offering to Play Forward a game by a non-indie developer.  


Posts with the following characteristics will be removed:  

+ Anyone requesting a game.  

+ Anyone encouraging playing games through illegal means

+ Anyone proposing a game swap or any other sort of quid pro quo.  
  
  
Once you have Played-Forward a game, we'd also like to encourage the gifter(s) to check in with the receiver(s) after a few weeks have passed to see what they thought of the game, and see if they plan on Playing-Forward that or a different game; this can serve as a gentle reminder to keep the chain alive.

*Branch 1:*

Ali-sama woke up early this morning, prostitution is illegal, I'm calling the police.' Ali-sama was sent to jail, but on the plus side he met a man called Big Pete, and he got the human touch he always wanted!  After his first encounter with Big Pete, Ali-sama realised he no longer had an urge for human touch, so he asked for his one phone call. Mustering all his courage, and it hit him right in the feels. He remembered the days when Big Pete and he would smuggle kabobs into the prison yard by disguising them as cocaine, Ali-Sama disguised himself as a kabob (which are strictly contraband in prison, and Ali-Sama was transported to a waste disposal plant outside the prison gates. He rose from the trash heaps

*Branch 2:*

Ali-sama woke up early this morning, they were fresh out of hugs! A wandering group of vermicious knids had stolen then last few, and headed towards /r/karmacourt, where they devoured some karma being held as evidence and escaped on The Magic School Bus ...

*Branch 3:*

From the website. 

&gt; It’s a co-op survival horror game. Up to 6 players in online co-op mode, playing the Solo mode. The aim – cleanse each area of zombies, in waves, until you get to the last one. The Big One. The Patriarch. Then exterminate him, too. Actually, they aren’t “zombies”. They are the left-over “specimens” from a cheap and dirty government program to clone soldier-monsters. The basic ones will just munch on your arm and try to disembowel you. The bigger ones were the first ones they tried arming. Nothing much. Just a chainsaw or a blade for starters. They had just got on to the chain gun and rockets when the government tried to secretly shut down their secret program.

Welcome to Random &amp; Roulette.

**2)** Roll on [random.org](http://www.random.org) a number in the range of 2801-5600 (Roulette) and post your number.

* Your account is in good standing (not on the shared ban list
* Each user may only post 1 (one) number.

* Each game has been pre-assigned a random 100 number sequence for the roulette range.  In roulette
* You must have a steam account.  There are no requirements on your steam account.
* Tie (due to a Roulette roller not knowing if they duplicate a roll from a specific game) rolls go to the Rouletter.

Let me tell you about Cave Story. It is a fantastic game. It is a side scrolling adventure. I'd say it's like metroid, and then by buying Cave Story 3D. AND NOW, I am making it even more right by buying a copy to give to somebody who may have considered stealing it, but just hasn't bothered yet. 

So here's the deal. This game goes to the individual guesses the number I'm thinking of right now between 1 and 500. there. I thought the number. I hope your time travelling telepathy is working.

One more number to go! Possibly! I won't lie, so maybe number three is gone already as well. but keep trying! 
Keep guessing! 



*FINAL EDIT*
Alright! Woo. Today... was not nearly as great as yesterday. However

The first number - 21. (the number of days until I get to see my girlfriend for Christmas holidays! Now, but I had already chosen new numbers. Sorry, second lucky guesser. Maybe next time. 

The Second number was - 51. AND YOU THOUGHT YOU SHOULDN'T ENTER **ERITH_FI**. 

The third, but I have a confession.  The second two numbers were actually the last four digits of a phone number I got last night from some chick that liked my swagger.

Welcome reddit gamers to my boredom and extra games list.


Welcome to Random &amp; Roulette.


**There are two ways to play (you may choose one):**

**1)** Roll on [random.org](http://www.random.org) a number in the range before the game you most prefer and post your number.

**2)** Roll on [random.org](http://www.random.org) a number in the range of 1001-2000 (Roulette) and post your number.


**The Rules:**

* **You meet the subreddit's Rule #1 (see the sidebar)**
* Your account is in good standing (not on the shared ban list
* Each user may only post 1 (one) number.
* It is your own duty to make sure you don't post a duplicate (CTRL+F)
* Each game has been pre-assigned a random 100 number sequence for the roulette range.  In roulette
* You must have a steam account.  There are no requirements on your steam account.
* Tie (due to a Roulette roller not knowing if they duplicate a roll from a specific game) rolls go to the Rouletter.
* If a roulette winner is unable to take a gift because they already own it (a risk you must consider), but that's the game of Roulette)


**Winners will be notified in approximately 48 hours on the evening of Sunday December 9th (USA evening).**

(*Thanks for coming out

**ROUND FOUR**  
**=========**

**Sniper vs. Adam Jensen!**  
Sniper creeps up the stairs of the air control tower. Whoever's here is even quieter than him. He surveys the deck of the aircraft carrier. Silence and stillness. He sets up his equipment.

//

The sea air isn't great for Adam's arm. It still clicks slightly when he clenches his fist. Infrared scans are scattered by the wind

//

He removes his glasses and cleans the scope. This old rifle wasn't much to look at

//

Breaking into a jet fighter would be a lot easier in the cockpit

Adam begins to run in the shadows. High ground. For just a second

//

*A distraction, waiting for a shot. Even a moment is enough.

//

There's a low grinding as the jet slides off the bow. Adam sprints up the stairs

""Thanks for standing still

Adam turns to run

*Champion: Sniper! (ArchaeopteryxAlex)*  
*Runner-up: Adam Jensen (ThePancakeMan)*

---

**ROUND THREE**  
**==========**

**Isaac vs. Sniper:**  
Sister Maggy hits the ground with a falsetto whimper. Isaac and Little Steve duck behind a corner. A bullet strikes the blade jutting out of Isaac's torso. He rolls to hide it. He'll need the range. He holds out the Bag of Bombs. Steve looks uncertain. Isaac pushes it towards him

Steve generally prefers to be on the other end of sending someone to die. He takes the satchel and begins making his way towards the grassy embankment. At dusk

//

""Bloody hell

The little guy charges up the hillside

Sniper hastily adopts a new line of fire. As he sprints, and the blast of the first bomb. He reaches into his knapsack and chucks a jarful of ol' Yellow Mountain Springs behind the offending rock. A sizzle. A gasp. Muffled retching. Sniper kicks the strange little doll aside and grabs the moist satchel, flinging it where he saw that bronzed hilt a minute before.

A moment later, pulling the curved blade from Isaac's chest. ""Nice knife.""

*Winner: Sniper!*

**James Bond vs. Adam Jensen:**  
""A negotiation

""You and I both know that's not how this ends.""

James curses under his breath, ""they'll kill you after you finish with me. You need protection.""

//

*He's stalling

The portal gun lies on the warehouse floor, he just started glowing green.

Now this standoff

He looks up, he pulls the clip from his gun and flings it towards the hole.

A perfect shot. It flies sideways through a wall behind Bond. Adam hopes the distraction works as he lunges for the portal gun. A bullet catches him by the shoulder

""Fuck this

Adam loads up his specs and starts putting himself back together.

His core pings cheerily; the message has been decoded.

*Winner: Adam Jensen!*

**Final round: Sniper vs. Jensen!*

---

**ROUND TWO**  
**=========**

**Kratos vs. Isaac:**  
Even under the assault of a thousand chocolate milk bubbles, an opening -- but his blade shatters inches from its target, and a small housefly whimpers and falls. In his gleeful confusion, Kratos simply doesn't notice that Isaac's cheeks have grown to the size of basketballs. *Winner: Isaac!*

**The Kid vs. Sniper:**  
The Kid's fast, and he tumbles for cover. All those years on patrol, all those songs he took for granted - The Kid crouches behind a rock and lines up a shot. His aim is true, and the blade ricochets. Kid hears a fleshy grunt, and dares to take a peek. He collapses, draws his last breath. The gunman approaches, replacing his newly-destroyed leathery green shield with the Kid's fancy red one. Kid oughta mind his step next time.

**Tim vs. James Bond:**  
Bond just can't get a shot--just *one* shot--on this kid. Sometimes he moves too fast. Sometimes he slows the bullets. Finally, too cocky (he would later bemoan his own arrogance in a LiveJournal post,) and ventures into the slowness to pick the ring up again. It's too bad - Bond fires at it, and although the bullet slows as it approaches, Tim slows, too. After what seems like an eternity, the bullet kisses the ring and hangs there. Tim doesn't move, and notices he's taken on a slight green glow in the dust-up. Strange. *Winner: James Bond!*

**Chell vs. Adam Jensen:**  
Having no proper weapon to speak of, changes origin, too. The twenty-mile drop, she thinks. It's the only way for someone who's nearly killed her twice before simply disappearing into the shadow or behind a staircase. She takes cover and waits while he falls. He'll have hit terminal velocity by now, she knows, but just in case that's not enough, better give him a little time to break a bone or two on the portal edges.

She knew he had the armor. She didn't know about the tech. With a little concentration, his new feet braced for any impact. He raises his gun. *Winner: Adam Jensen*


The New Ladder:

* Isaac vs. Sniper
* James Bond vs. Adam Jensen

I'll post these last three battles all in a go

---

**ROUND ONE**  
**========**

**Kratos vs. The Joker:**  
The Joker may be an agent of chaos, and Kratos--after chasing the villain through a minefield, abandoned sawmill, and poison cloud--manages to run the bastard through. Maybe it's the victory, but Kratos just can't help but smile. *Winner: Kratos!*

**Isaac vs. Montezuma:**  
Maybe Montezuma is a god, Isaac stumbles across a slot machine, a can of dog food, and a carton of chocolate milk. Man, Montezuma is *screwed*. Isaac grabs his silvered headdress. *Winner: Isaac!*

**The Kid vs. Samus:**  
The Kid isn't easily surprised, but The Kid can't help but wonder if she might have been a kindred spirit. Damn shame. *Winner: The Kid!*

**The Sniper vs. Alan Wake:**  
The mirror blinding the sniper was a neat trick, the hired killer put aside his laser-scope and went old-fashioned: a nice bow and arrow. *Winner: Sniper!*

**Isaac Clarke vs. Tim:**  
He must've died to the plasma cutter at least seven times. Each time, but this one caught him off-guard. Landing directly on his head, Tim cracked the engineer's neck. *Strange these things can sometimes be,* he thought. Then he wrote it down in his journal in elaborate cursive. *Winner: Tim*

**James Bond vs. Alyx Vance:**  
It's uncertain what took place in the bedroom before their inevitable shootout

**The Courier vs. Chell:**  
You ever seen [Portal: No Escape](http://youtu.be/4drucg1A6Xk)? Well

**Gordon Freeman vs. Adam Jensen:**  
The remnants of a shattered crowbar. The echo of an empty chamber. An old orange suit, the glimmer of metal through the holes in his jacket. ""Sorry about that,"" the man says. *Winner: Adam Jensen!*


**New Ladder**

Nobody guessed either of the magic numbers! Shoot. Sorry

---

**CONTEST IS CLOSED**

So I had to knock it down to sixteen participants. My apologies to those who were only entering for fun; I had to boot you to make a nice even tournament.

Our 16 entrants are (in no particular order):

* Isaac Clarke
* The Sniper
* Chell
* Gordon Freeman
* Samus
* Tim
* The Kid
* The Joker
* Alex Vance
* Adam Jensen
* Isaac
* The Courier
* Kratos
* James Bond
* Montezuma
* Alan Wake

I'll get back to you folks in a bit with the pairings later tonight

*note:* Nobody guessed either of the mystery numbers! Try again for the mystery prize in my next PiF! I'll keep using that same number until someone guesses it.

---

Flavor aside

* **A number between 1-1000**. This enters you for the mystery prize
* **A video game character. Any character**. This determines who wins
* **Your Steam profile**. Not your name

The prizes include:

* **Champion**: Your choice of [Dungeon Defenders](http://store.steampowered.com/app/65800/) or [The Misadventures of P.B. Winterbottom](http://store.steampowered.com/app/40930/).
* **Runner-Up**: Whichever of the two above games was not chosen.
* **Guess the magic number!**: Win the secret prize: your pick of my Steam Inventory. What's inside? *IT'S A MYSTERY*.
* **Your guessed number counts twice!** I've created a second secret number for this PiF only. If you guess *this one*

Also

This contest will close tomorrow, when this post is 24 hours old.

---

So just like last time, the runner-up will receive whichever game is left.

Entries that don't make it into the tournament for whatever reason (probably something to do with fair ladders requiring 2^n participants) will still be given a chance at a **GRAND FABULOUS PRIZE** simply by guessing a number.

I'll randomly choose sixteen (probably) entries, in a variety of exotic locales and dangerous scenarios! I'll determine who fights whom, unless there's a popular request. After the ladder's drawn up, these characters will face off regardless of franchise, universe, or loyalty. Then, I'll determine the winner via presumably arbitrary means. Know this: each fight will be at least somewhat fair.

After that, until there are only two. This final battle will receive a bit more detail, but I'll describe each fight at least a little. If you'd like to contest the results of a given battle, I welcome you to submit a complaint to someone who cares.

http://ninite.com/ - It's a sweet website that allows you to install many different freeware utilities extremely quickly and easily.  It makes a fresh format a pleasure instead of a chore.  You can easily download your favorite browser, and more in a single download instead of hunting everywhere for them.

The game that was my first obsession was the original Jak and Daxter. My parents bought the PS2, and eventually I rented the game over a spring break. Of course, I didn't have a memory card, so I had to leave the console on 24/7, and the rental period wasn't enough to beat the game, but I was hooked. Eventually I scraped up enough money to buy the full game, and it was the first game I got 100% completion on.

So then he gave me FIVE free copies of the game. I'm not cool enough to give away all five copies here on reddit

How to get the key: Do anything, anything. 

Ideas: Post a video of you playing the spaz demo, tell a story, talk about why you want it, talk about yourself, post a funny picture, do something. 

Seriously do anything :). Good luck

The game doesn't take that long to complete (about 3 hours or so). I enjoyed the game but thought it had some flaws. There were some parts (like the final boss battle) that I felt were too difficult and the game stopped being ""fun"". That's just like my opinion though so who is to say someone else wont enjoy the game more than I did. So in the spirit of PiF I decided to play the same game forward and not change it up. 

To enter to win the game comment with the following.

1. Link to steam profile (public)
2. Tell me why you want Hydrophobia. 

I had some trouble getting the game to run on Windows 7 but it's easily fixed by a quick google search. 

Edit: forgot to say I will pick the winner around Wednesday. I have final exams this week so that might get pushed back =)

[LA Noir](http://store.steampowered.com/app/110800/) is very GTA-esque, like heavy rain. 

&gt;Amid the post-war boom of Hollywood's Golden Age, and murder rates are at an all-time high. In his fight to climb the ranks and do what's right, Phelps must unravel the truth behind a string of arson attacks, racketeering conspiracies and brutal murders, battling the L.A. underworld and even members of his own department to uncover a secret that could shake the city to its rotten core.

1340905246.0,vr1fu,"[Pif] Various indie games in alphabetical order. This week: games beginning with C, D &amp; E.",Pif-alphabetically,19,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward/comments/vr1fu/pif_various_indie_games_in_alphabetical_order/

The idea is
 
* You can suggest more games for me play forward
* You can ask for up to three games
* I may pif all of the games forward


[**Chantelise**](http://store.steampowered.com/app/70420/) Don't ask for this if you only know about this game from the creators (&amp; translators) previous release: Recettear. Why? Because they are radically different games. Also, you instead use money to purchase better stats. This mechanic will seem familiar to those of you who have played custom maps for Warcraft 3, but hopefully new to the rest. The main reason I'm playing this forward is the care and attention that the translators (or localizationers, maybe) paid in bringing Chantelise to an English-speaking audience. See what they have to say about translating [here](http://www.carpefulgur.com/faq.html).  

[**Chime**](http://store.steampowered.com/app/62100/) the [tutorial video](http://store.steampowered.com/video/62100) does an EXCELLENT job at showing off the mechanics at play. For those who can't watch

[**Cogs**](http://store.steampowered.com/app/26500/) Once again: watch trailer. Now you understand why it is interesting.

[**Desktop Dungeons**](http://www.desktopdungeons.net/) This roguelike solves a couple different problems of the genre, in each of the different scenarios. Also: I have played the [free alpha](http://www.desktopdungeons.net/?page_id=11) for longer than I care to admit.

**Dominion** [Official page](http://www.riograndegames.com/games.html?id=278)
Physical Card Game for 2-4 players. The versatility and re-playability make this game a joy. To explain: there are 25 different ""kingdom cards"" in here, making sorting/starting so easy.  

[**Dreamscape**](http://www.desura.com/games/dreamscape) You have magical headphones that can explore the dreams &amp; imagination of characters you meet

[**Dungeons of Dredmor**](http://store.steampowered.com/app/98800/) Comic Roguelike with great customization. More will be said later.

[**E.Y.E. Divine Cybermancy**](http://store.steampowered.com/app/91700/) This game does people's heads in. I don't blame you if you have a hard time getting into it. Nearly nothing is explained to you, and death isn't a big penalty.  

**Cards Against Humanity** [as recommended in this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward/comments/vr1fu/pif_various_indie_games_in_alphabetical_order/c57ip63)

**EDGE** thankyou DizzyEevee for reminding me. A visually minimalist isometric platformer, and at least one of the steam sale achievement hunts. Plus, they added an extra 45 levels to EDGE for free.  

**Defcom** as recommended in [this comment below](http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward/comments/vr1fu/pif_various_indie_games_in_alphabetical_order/c57p136).  

**THIS LIST IS NOT COMPLETE. I need you to recommend (in the comments below) more games for me to play forward**  

Not playing forward and why: Escape goat *was recently in Indie Royale bundle.* Cthulu saves the world *free if you buy [Penny Arcade's OTRSPOD3](http://store.steampowered.com/app/213030/) before Monday.* Cave story+ - *the original Cave Story is free in full if you're on the fence about buying it.* Dungeon defenders - *way too grindy,Closed,False,,t5_2s4e5,1341129816.0,closed,True

EDIT: I would also like to note that the purpose (and name) of playitfoward is to receive something, if you are interested, and especially if you win, be willing to play it forward later. I almost certain that you will like the game no matter who you are, but if for some reason you don't give out another game instead. BEST!

EDIT2: Boy, the redditors participating today are the longest tenured of any PiF I've done. I also see a lot of people who want to use board games as a way to connect with their significant others, family and friends, which I fully endorse and see as the most important aspect of board games. Ultimately I am choosing misterbeaver though, because, well you know why. To everyone else, thank you. I've really enjoyed reading all of your replies. I'm a lover of games, so if you didn't win today

The closest valid entry to this number was **13**

I bought a copy of this game for my grandfather, so don't get this if you're not willing to put a lot of thought into it.

[Game's Website](http://www.spacechemthegame.com)

[Steam Page](http://store.steampowered.com/app/92800)

[Metacritic Reviews](http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/spacechem)

**Rules for valid entries:**

* Your entry must contain at least one good reason you want this game
* A link to your Steam ID/profile
* Your reddit account must have been registered for **at least** 2 months and/or have 300 combined link/comment karma (as per the rules in the sidebar)
* Your Steam account must be active
* Finally
* Any entry failing to meet these requirements will not be considered in the drawing.

**Notes about the giveaway:**

* The drawing will be done in **1 day**.
* I do not believe being partial to any one person is ethical in giveaways
* The winning number will be drawn using random.org. If no one guesses the exact number
* If there are two ""closest numbers"" on either side of the winning number (e.g. the winning number is 90 and two people guessed 88 and 92)
* If more than one person guesses the correct number, then use random.org to draw another number.  Whoever's portion of the timeline that number falls inside will be the winner.
* I will PM the winner letting them know they have won

Thank you and good luck!

A great RPG that you probably should have played by now, and must link your Steam account with 3+ paid games.  More consideration will be given to positive PIFers, but does not guarantee you will win.  Deadline is Monday, Nov 28, and I'll pick a winner that evening.

Tell me about your proudest gaming achievement in whatever medium you prefer (text, youtube video, etc).  Was your WoW guild server first on Nefarian back in Vanilla?  Did you beat EGIdrA on the Starcraft 2 ladder?  Was it the first time you beat Super Mario Bros?  Tell me about it.  Best story wins.

1319992761.0,lu688,[PiF] Onlive Console for £1 (UK Only),init20,20,1,15,"**edit: Code sent

I'm not sure if this is allowed seeing as it's techincally going to cost a redditor a little bit of money rather than getting it for free but it's the only way I could think of playing it foward now rather than later.

I have a [voucher](http://i.imgur.com/Oaadj.jpg) from the recent eurogamer expo good for one OnLive console which is worth [£70](https://www.onlive.co.uk/store/order). I've been told that you will need to pay shipping on top of the £1 so altogether it comes to around £7 I think? Might depend on where you live in the UK. 

This is also really important!! OnLive are currently doing a deal for new users where you can get your first game for £1. You absolutely must do this before you use the code or you will lose out on that deal.

As for how to choose who gets it

So to recap. Onlive console voucher for £1 + shipping plus your first game for £1 which you must get first. Post and I'll pick someone at random after 24 hours to recieve.

A big shoutout to blakeh who recently gave me a game and inspired me to pif.
