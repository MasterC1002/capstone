Everything.

Everything.

My name

Everything that makes me whole. Everything that makes me one. Everything that makes me... me. Everything that makes me myself, they took it all, and they left nothing. They left me an empty husk, a shell of what I once was. 

They took everything.

Everything.

Everything.

I have no name. I have no face. I have nothing left... nothing.

My self. My identity. My... everything--it's gone.

But then they came again. This time, my identity, my peace of mind, my sanity. My face. My skin. Everything. 

No, they left something. 

They came and they looked me in the eye--well, look in me, and they said, in a shrill, piercing voice, in a voice that could cut a man's skin, in a voice that could cut into a man's bones

 ""You are cancer.""

They said nothing else. 

But first, around each arm. Then, around my throat. I struggled, but to no avail. They gripped my throat, and tightened, tightening and tightening until I gave up and grew limp, but I was not yet unconscious. Then, what once was my face--with two hands, still holding me fiercely, long

I sat there for hours until somewhere I found the strength to get up. I looked around and realized I was not in my home, and I washed wounded face, cleaning it of grime and blood. I looked into the water with eyes I did not have and saw my reflection. I remembered, they had marked me. 

I saw my face

∳

That was the mark they had left on my blank face. And I realized

∳. That was who I was to be now. ∳. I am ∳. My name is ∳. ∳ is who I am.

But nightmares, and you're heart's beating bloody murder in your chest and all you want is to WAKE UP--that's beautiful. Yes, it's frightening, of course it is. But that's the beauty of it. It isn't real. It's your mind playing tricks on you, your unconscious mind exposing itself, projecting itself, overcoming your senses with fear and anxiety. 

But it isn't real. It's just your imagination. just a silly old dream after all, I'm dreaming, aren't I? But even then, you can't fully comprehend the absurdity f the dream world until you awaken--and that's what makes it beautiful. Dreams, especially nightmares, consume you. They envelop you completely, constructing an entire world around you that you are then forced to interact with. Only when you awaken do you escape. It's beautiful

I think it's beautiful here
