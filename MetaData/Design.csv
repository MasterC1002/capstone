1343416276.0,x9fi6,Your logo is bad and you should feel bad: From a printer/designer about your unprintable logos.,jadeddesigner,858,136,306,"Alright designers

I keep seeing posts about designers asking for critiques on their logos. 9 times out of ten

• Start your logo by only working in black.

Straight up, but I try to stick around 3.

• Limit your gradients and expect resistance.

Gradients are the bane of a printer's existence. It may look great on computer monitor, printer to printer. 

• For the love of god

So, time to go back to the drawing board. Create versions of logo that can be placed horizontally, vertically and without type (unless the typography is your logo). Your skinny type isn't going to show up on a piece of fabric because it's going to be lost on the threads. Always have longevity and functionality in mind when you design! That's design 101, and it's amazing how many designers forget that.

I get told a lot by a lot of amateur/small time designers that, and here's why:

• Printing is expensive.

I don't know if you know this

The other thing is that using alternative printing methods price by the number of plates/screens/inks used. Right now, because YOU WILL end up having it printed or someone else will print it for you (ie, sponsor, advertisement, etc). And I'm sure you want it looking good and recognizable. 

What alternative methods? I'm talking about offset and flexographic and screen printing. All of these forms of printing have their pros and cons

Anyway

**EDIT:**

A few other points should have been made thanks to other's posts.

• VECTOR

Your logo needs to be vectored

• Pantones.

Buy yourself a pantone book

• Color Match

Finicky about colors? It's your job as a designer to request that your colors be color matched to an already made up hard copy. Inks are typically transparent and the paper or substrate behind the ink has a tendency to come through. That means your logo has a chance of always being printed darker than it's intended color. Ask for your colors to be color matched against an already perfect print of yours on the paper or medium you are printing it on. 

• You signed it

This one is simple. If you sign that proof, but all in all, you are probably going to eat that cost.

1341915488.0,wbl6i,The Next Reddit. A responsible redesign.,44oz,336,41,79,"Trying to redesign a site that has been a part of millions of users lives throughout the past many years is not an easy task. 

Changing where things are laid out or how things are organized in a drastic way can spell death if not done in small steps over many years for a site like this.

I have noticed over the years that for some reason, but for whatever reason, websites with lists of links in a tight space in organized rows or columns tend to perform really well and generates loyalists for life. 

Sites like Drudge, simplified into what first seems a cluttered grouping of tons of content that can set a designer's brain on fire, but for some reason, users find it easy to navigate, scan, use and fall in love with.

When I went forward with designing a new reddit.com, but does not scare away the loyalists... which by now is pretty much everyone. How can I redesign the style to be clean and modern yet classic and timeless.

It was not an easy task

List View
http://i.imgur.com/S1qg9.jpg

Collapsed View
http://i.imgur.com/q0J98.jpg


As you can see the main goals in this task where to introduce a faster way to let people become part of communities, still have amazing access to the front page, all while making sure you can still satisfy the loyalists with a collapsed top nav view.

I really set out to make things very familiar but yet refined. Making areas more defined, organized yet the same.

I purposefully did not go down the route of creating a bunch of white space that most designers gravitiate toward right away

Of course this is just one view into a site that has many different configurations, hope, you can appreciate this stab at designing a site that is almost impossible to design. A site that is loved by many, that fears change. 

I believe if done right

Love it

TL;DR 
I redesigned reddit hopefully in a responsible way.

No one ever said shit about any of this in college

Below is a wish list of traits that I look for in potential hires. 

**Learn how to write an email**
Loosen up. Show some personality. We're a creative agency, I'd want to be addressed in a more casual fashion. ""Dear all"", ""Hello, ladies and gentlemen""… anything that hints that you're interesting makes me much more receptive to your message. 

**Be Assertive**
Ask questions in your interview. It sounds cliche, I'd interpret it as initiative. That's a good thing. 

**Don't second guess your work**
When you bring a portfolio in

**Be Positive**
Please don't tell me how hard it is to find a job.. or how long it's been since you worked. I'm sorry if you haven't been able to get a job, not just get a job. 

**Be Useful**
I'd say that about 20% of the people that have emailed me don't have portfolios. 20% of the people that do

**Be Normal**
More than anything, who can add something to the culture at our office. 

**Be on time**
Please don't show up 30 minutes late and not say shit about it. We're busy and when we have to adjust things to fit your schedule,False,,t5_2qh78,False,,,t3_utlik

&gt;This past SEMA I had

&gt;Month before the event and working with a marketing company everything was in order to be at one of the biggest booths with plenty of space as well as plenty of support to take on this endeavor that needed to be done within 4 days. Obviously this was no small task and any and all support would of been needed as well as being involved with one of the largest vendors at SEMA with amazing foot traffic.

&gt;A week before the event in a frenzy, meaning it would just be me and my team working along with Mishimoto branding. Totally understandable, but since this changed the dynamic and trust, Mishimoto would now have to fund my efforts directly and everything just seemed sketchy days before the event. They could not afford my core price of $5000 and with only week before the actual event they offered $1000 + expenses (taxis, food costs, etc) which we agreed upon since I was looking forward more to the opportunity to work on this project more so than actual costs. In the end, I just wanted my basics covered and to have funds to pay Zombie Yeti for his time to assist me on this endeavor.

&gt;Sadly
&gt;From the first moment we started to the last moment when we finished up we had no respect given and any verbal agreement to assist in our efforts were ignored. Even the simple fact of asking for a small chair to sit and work on lower details was ignored. When both Zombie Yeti &amp; I approached this, shake the car pretty hard to take off the hood so some SEMA celeb could sign it.  Everything became awkward quite fast and our frustrations working with them grew and grew as time progressed.  Simple things of being bossed around or being told ‘how’ to do things made it mind numbing to say the least.  However Zombie Yeti and I held our heads up high and did our best with what we were working with.

&gt;With 2 days left, or flipping the car so we can work and wouldn’t be hidden between booths.  Really the core reason why we were there was to let passer goers of SEMA see us draw thus getting them to talk with Mishimoto and about their products.   The car was not flipped and they still expected us to finish that side.  Both Zombie Yeti &amp; I decided that we wanted to finish the car proper and started.  Imagine trying to draw in 3foot of space for two days.  Quite the task, but we couldn’t stand back and proof our work. After the event, I Invoiced Mishimoto and shortly got a message back that he was instructed by the owner to not to pay me. The first reasons were rhetoric and subjective immaturity thus promoting the annoyance that is Mishimoto:

&gt;• ""1-2 hours late every day""
• ""you didn't even have the common courtesy to say goodbye ""
• ""I had to pay another artist to finish the design and then erase all of original marks left from your carbon stencil""


&gt;This was absurd reasons.  1. The ‘late’ aspect was because Zombie Yeti &amp; I would have a meeting at the hotel about how to figure out solutions and set the daily goals.  2. Saying goodbye? Really? 3. Paying another artist?  Why? We (Zombie yeti &amp; I) agreed that the carbon details (pencil lines) defined the piece and added authenticity as well as if we tried to erase them them cleanly

&gt;So in the end.  This is my story of the events.  Mishimoto already threaten to sue me if I release my accounts of SEMA, but don’t have the money to pay you as the owner of Mishimoto stated in our emails:  “'skimpy expenses' you feel you are owed”  At the end, it’s just $1250.  That is it.  Quite sad isn’t it.""",,False,,t5_2qh78,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/peu9d/injustice_against_an_artist/

1318437733.0,l9pov, An Apology to the /r/Design Community,chrismsx,250,60,65,"Recently I made a post about what I thought would be a thread about color and how it effects the reception of your resume.  Instead **what I got were a bunch of critiques about poor typography and clutter.**  

Initially my response was to ignore everyone because the sample I provided was a rough prototype but as more and more people started to dig at my design

**I wound up having some good constructive conversations once I swallowed my pride** and took a look at what my resume REALLY looked like.  I wound up learning a lot about the effective use of white space

The lessons I took away from my fellow redditors in the design community allowed me to solve this. I sat down and REALLY looked at my resume and line by line removed everything that repeated or wasn't necessary to covey the message I wanted potential employers to receive.  I told someone in the thread that I'd be selling myself short by writing less about myself but in essence I was selling myself short by not believing that I could find a more user friendly way to convey a message. 

I just wanted to take this opportunity thank all the design professionals and fellow design redditors for being harsh

**Summary:** *I was a defensive ass hat when all you guys wanted to do was help. I'm sorry. You are all awesome and I appreciate your free help and guidence.*

A while back my mom found Yukifumi Shibasaki on Instagram. He's a graphic designer/photographer/artist. She showed me his feed and I started following him too because I really loved his work. Through Facebook and commenting on each other's photos my mom and him became friends.

One day, a letter, a collection of flyers he had designed, and a cute little illustration done by his girlfriend (see the gallery link for pictures).

I was just so struck by this gesture, debt, having go to onto welfare, and suffering depression. And now he's hoping to build a new career around his paintings. It makes me feel so happy that mine and my mom's words have given him confidence in his work.

Here's the links to his Instagram and Flickr accounts if anyone would like to see his other work:
