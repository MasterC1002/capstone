For the love of all that is holy, ""will this toaster work?"" threads. _It's nonsense. 99% of the builds you guys post up will work *just fine* in OSX._ The question is can _YOU_ get it to work. [Gigabyte motherboard, Intel chip, nvidia graphics -- of course it will work! Spend two seconds on tonymacx86.com and you'll have your answer.] **Stop worrying and start building.**

Also, but overall just does _not work_. The closer you are to vanilla the greater your chances are for complete success, and the more you understand your own build, the easier it becomes to figure out what is and isn't working. 

Learning the ins and outs of OSX is mostly an exercise in frustration, but once you understand the fundamentals you realize you can basically install OSX on damn near anything that closely resembles actual Apple hardware.  

So lets have discussions on what FakeSMC does

I've learned in the hobby of hackintoshing
Telling people to google it is making the effort to teach them HOW to solve the inevitable problems their going to run into. Asking on a forum takes much more time and effort than just googling a few key words. And honestly, I hate seeing the same question 30 times in a week. So instead of being an ass, I'm trying to help teach HOW I, or any other senior hackintosher, solves our problems.

This is becoming an issue on this sub and you and the mods and everyone else here better start figuring something out, but at some point someone did it for us and now we try and do it for you. A few of us hang around and try and help, but for the last month, I've gotten nothing but grief for trying to show how to solve problems. I'm an abrasive asshole, I own that. But I'm also a pretty amazing tech, but I'm tired of noobs on this sub acting like dipshit customers I used to have. If you're here it means you can do a modicum of sleuthing to fix your computer. But more and more, we get people in here from /r/buildapc who don't even know what BIOS stands for, or why they should bother wading into it

There needs to be some ground rules here aside from don't be an asshole. Google before asking should be a standard here. There is NOTHING that has been posted here that couldn't have been solved by looking on the first search page of google. People need to remember that hackintoshing can disappear almost overnight if Apple chooses to make things hard. They did it before with the first ""clone war"". Too many people were making clones
As a defense against that happening the hackintosh community as a whole needs to NOT BE MAINSTREAM. If it gets big enough, you do not belong in the hackintosh community. This hobby is about doing it for YOURSELF. Not your mom, not your office, yourself.
If this keeps happening this sub is going to be stuck where it is right now, you'll still be here, not googling the answer and still telling people to go to tonymac.

Software necessary:

* [iBoot](http://www.tonymacx86.com/downloads) (Free)
* [MultiBeast](http://www.tonymacx86.com/downloads) (Free)
* [xMove](http://www.tonymacx86.com/downloads) (Free)
* [Snow Leopard 10.6 or 10.6.3 DVD](http://store.apple.com/us/product/MC573Z/A) ($29.00)
* [Lion Upgrade app for now
    
This was by far, wipe out and re-install.  
    
First

* Motherboard: [EVGA X58 SLi](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813188061)
* Processor: [Intel Core i7 920 2.67 GHz](http://www.amazon.com/Intel-Processor-2-66GHz-LGA1366-BX80601920/dp/B001H5T7LK/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1311691470&amp;sr=8-1)

* RAM: [6GB Corsair Dominator DDR3 1600 (PC3 12800)](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820145295)
* Hard Drive: [Seagate Barracuda 1TB 7200 RPM SATA](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822148697)
* Optical Drive: [LG 12X BD-ROM/DVD-RW SATA](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16827136232)

* Keyboard: [Apple Wireless Mini Keyboard](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16823101008)
* Monitor: 2x 24"" Dell Ultrasharp
    
Now
    
The rest is simple to get Lion up and running.  Some key things to point out here that I had to figure out the hard way.  First, don't worry about it).  Then reboot, get to your BIOS setup screen, and:

* Set hard drive mode to AHCI (NOT RAID or IDE)
* Set your Jmicron ports to Enabled if you plan to use them
* In power management
* Set your graphics to boot PCIe instead of PCI (if applicable)
* Turn on integrated audio
* Set ethernet to Enabled (Both of them if more than one)
* In power settings

Next

* The hard drive you plan to install OS X to plugged into the 1st SATA port
* The DVD/Blu-Ray drive on the 2nd SATA port
* Only 1 graphics card
* Keyboard
* Mouse
* Only 1 monitor on the inner most DVI port
* Only up to 4 GB of RAM installed for now (If you have more
    
All of this is temporary until we get OS X installed.  Afterwards, and re-install all your other hardware.
    
Now that we've got your rig ready
    
**Step 1:** [Installing and updating Snow Leopard to 10.6.8 and installing necessary drivers (kexts).](http://tonymacx86.blogspot.com/2010/04/iboot-multibeast-install-mac-os-x-on.html)
    
* Note: If your sound is not working
* Note 2: Be sure to select ""System Utilities"" when installing any drivers.
* Note 3: In my build, remove them first.  This will cause a kernel panic when you attempt to boot into Lion the first time.

**Step 2:** [Installing Lion.](http://tonymacx86.blogspot.com/2011/07/xmove-multibeast-install-os-x-107-lion.html)

* Note: When booting the Installer partition, highlight the Installer partition and then type:

        PCIRootUID=1
    
If that doesn't work
    
          PCIROOTUID=1 -x
    
* Note 2: If you already have VooDooHDA installed and Lion is getting a kernel panic when you attempt to boot it after install

        rm -R /System/Library/Extensions/VoodooHDA.kext

        reboot
    

**Step 3:** Updating and installing any remaining drivers.

* Once you get to the desktop in Lion
* I had to re-install my network card drivers after upgrading to Lion.  No big deal
* If you didn't have sound support
* Reboot after driver install is done and you should be all good now.  If you have any questions
    
This whole process took me about 2 hours; quite fast for installing OS X on a hackintosh.  Especially because it's totally current right after a new OS X release.  I hope this helps everyone out.  Good luck!
    
    
**EDIT:**
    
I haven't tried sleep yet, but not really well.  I had issues with quiet audio, and the center channel was cranked all the way up, producing a white noise effect.  
    
    
There are plenty of resources for further information on how to generate your own DSDT.aml file, but I figured it can't hurt, right?  After generating my custom DSDT.aml file, I copied that to the root partition.  Then I removed the VooDooHDA.kext from /System/Library/Extensions with the command above.  Lastly I started up MultiBeast and selected the ALC8xxHDA and AppleHDA Rollback in the Audio category and checked System Utilities.  Once completed, I rebooted and was welcomed to a properly working audio card again.

I really think the Gigabyte GA-Z68X-UD3H-B3 is the go-to motherboard at the moment. There’s tons of support for it and everything works - sleep, Firewire, LAN, all onboard SATA (apparently on some boards the Marvel SATA3 ports don’t work but these do), audio, and everything else I can’t think to name.

I tried to use Kakewalk for my installation process. This board is supported but I just couldn’t get it to work at all. I have no idea why. It really wasn’t a big deal

I followed this [guide](http://tonymacx86.blogspot.com/2011/10/unibeast-install-mac-os-x-lion-using.html) just for the Unibeast section to get OS X installed.  I had heard of a few issues with 10.7.4 so I have 10.7.3 installed on mine at the moment. 


After that I used this [Gigabyte GA-Z68X-UD3H-B3 Tool Pack](http://www.osx86.net/downloads.php?do=file&amp;id=2463) to get everything working.

That tool pack just combines a bunch of installs and whatnot that you could find on your own if you wanted to. The directions in the tool pack are a little tough to follow but you don’t really need them. Just run the Chameleon installer (your bootloader) and then the installer for the motherboard (leave all the default boxes checked). That’s it.

The 6870 works out of the box. You don’t have to do anything with it. It’s the best card you can get that works without having to mess around with it at all and it’s plenty fast for the casual gamer.

I downloaded Multibeast as well and installed the HW Monitor tools - just a nice menu bar applet that shows you fan speed, run the TRIM enabler as well. Or better yet, use [this](http://www.groths.org/?page_id=322).


I went a little bit crazy with my storage. There’s an SSD and 4 HDs in my computer but they all serve a function. I have OS X and all my applications installed on the SSD. I then installed two 1 TB drives in a mirrored RAID array (simple software RAID using Apple’s disk utility) and moved my user folder to them. You can use this [guide](http://www.macworld.com/article/1164891/keeping_mac_os_and_data_on_separate_drives.html) for moving your user data to a separate HD.

I like this setup a lot. 128 GBs is plenty for the OS and applications. It’s super fast and I like having all my data written across two drives in case of failure. I also backup both drives to an external Time Machine backup and use Backblaze. And on top of that

And then there’s yet another HD in there for Windows 7. If you use Chameleon as your bootloader

For wireless I bought [this internal card](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16833704133)

I bought this [Bluetooth adapter](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16833340012) but couldn’t get it to work. Your mileage really varies with these things.

I ordered [this one](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002SBF108/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i00) a couple days ago but it hasn’t come in yet. Hopefully it works.

I also purchased this [webcam](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003M2YT96/ref=oh_details_o03_s00_i00) to replace the built in iSight camera on my iMac. It’s far

Overall

Keep in mind, little things keep adding up. Make sure you take into account Bluetooth, wireless, and a webcam if you need them. That’s likely over $100 right there.

Also

If you’re willing to put in the time it’s still a great deal. With my overlock I’m getting Geekbench scores of about 14, minus monitors and storage, is about $1,200. That’s with spending a lot on the case and other things that were a personal choice. It can obviously be done way cheaper.

If you want to start with my build as a template

I hope all of this helps some of you in some way. This Hackintosh was a lot of fun to build. Comment if you have any questions. I’ll try to be as helpful as possible.

[Album First

After using my MacBook Pro for a couple of years, so it seemed like a no-brainer to buy that and mod the case. While it turned into a lot tougher of a project than I had originally expected, I am very happy with the outcome. Here's the parts list:

Since it's going to be primarily for graphic design and photography work, gaming performance isn't a huge deal to me. Sure, I'll play a game of Starcraft or two occasionally, but it's not a gaming rig. The current drive setup I have in the system is the Samsung 840 for boot and the WD Blue 1tb for my 'working' data. The two Greens are in a RAID 1 Mirror, so that's where I store my Time Machine backups and all my *ahem* acquired movies and tv shows.

A major constraint I had on building the system was OSX compatibility. I know most of you are Windows users, Mass Effect) and maybe some 3D Rendering.

After the whole process

**Good**

 - A really fun project. I really took my time with it
 - So far
 - The watercooling loop was a lot easier to assemble and bleed than I was anticipating.
 - Very quiet. That's one thing I was unhappy with about my MacBook Pro
 - Should be pretty future-proofed for the kind of stuff I need. Hopefully I won't need to make any serious modifications for the next couple years.


**Not so Good**

 - Getting all the drives in place was a MASSIVE pain in the ass and, imagine trying to thread a needle, when you can't see the needle or the thread, and you're trying to do the whole thing in a box full of knives. Not fun.

 - Due to Apple's stupid design on the front panel, it's kind of annoying.
 - Due to the case design, as many cases do. That would make the whole process about a million times easier.

**ToDo's**

 - I'd like to try making a jumper cable to solve the FireWire Ground issue. That way

 - The GPU power still needs to be sleeved. Not terribly difficult

Other than those things, which will be far more fun than studying for finals (as I should be doing.) Thanks for reading all the way through... I know it was long :)

Bluetooth, and gpu with QE/CI all work out of box.

HDMI out works flawlessly with rotation.
VGA works with a small caveat.


Note: I also bought a HD caddy and replaced the CD drive with the 500GB hard drive and installed a 60GB Mushkin SSD from which the OS is installed. Boots in 15 seconds.


The only issues are: 
&gt; the bluetooth stops working after sleep and doesn't support the magic mouse. Fixed with a usb dongle.

&gt;Wifi stops working after sleep. Disable and re-enable it from the quickbar and it works again.

&gt; VGA display turns black when changing resolution. (I use a 1080x1920 external monitor for coding.) This is fixed by using the *wake trick*; Put laptop to sleep and then wake it. The VGA display turns back on when it wakes back up at the resolution you set.

&gt; Battery life is only 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Take it or leave it.

My Mac Pro 3, because Apple is likely waiting on Ivy Bridge Xeons. I don't even know if this thing will boot that long.

I really don't know that I have the time/patience to carefully test every single OS update that comes down the pipe, yet I'm afraid that if I don't, I'll be looking at a non-booting Hackintosh that I get to clean install or whatever to get back. 

So my question(s) to you folks is this:

How **long** have you been happily Hackintoshing? How many years? How many OS updates? Are you current? Is that even possible?

Thanks much in advance.

I must say

Unibeast + Multibeast was almost seamless, while I was blown away to discover that there was a DSDT just for me, already available in the TonyMac archive. It only took two reboots and I have a functional, sleepable box with everything but audio.  

I think I'm going to just grab one of the USB audio adapters I have ferreted away in a drawer, and learn how to best image the working system to a thumb drive for convenient restore recovery. Only then will I bother with relearning how to swap the KEXT's and find a fitting VooDoo/HDA/RealTek driver. 



Thanks to you guys I learned that I should drop to 4GB memory before installing. Thanks to you guys I knew that sticking close to Intel-reference components simplifies the equation a bit. 

Thanks to you, I have a new fixation, all over again.

* Intel Core i7-2600 Processor

* Gigabyte GA-Z68X-UD3H-B3 Motherboard

* Gigabyte ATI Radeon HD6870 1GB Video Card

* HP ZR24w 24-inch 1920x1200 Monitor

* Corsair Vengeance Blue SDRAM (16GB)

* Corsair Force GT 60GB Solid State Drive

* DIY AirPort Card (ebay!)

* Lite-On LightScribe 24X

* Cooler Master Hyper 212 Plus CPU Cooler

* Antec Performance One P183 Case

* Apple Wired Keyboard

* Logitech MX Revolution

  .

###*Construction*  
I haven't built or owned a tower for over a decade. I put the thing together the night I received all the components. Incredibly, was a breeze.  

  .

###*Experience*  
This machine is primarily being used for video editing. (NOTE: I have a 2TB G-Tech drive w/ eSATA for my media). I referred to [NoFilmSchool's Hac Pro](http://nofilmschool.com/build-a-hackintosh/where-to-buy/) list as a model and bought most everything Koo suggested. Koo’s step-by-step assembly and explanation and [Tonymac’s UniBeast/Multibeast]( http://tonymacx86.blogspot.com/2011/10/unibeast-install-mac-os-x-lion-using.html) installation was perfect. This thing boots in about 5 seconds.

  .

###*Video Editing*  
I decided to take the plunge and learn Final Cut Pro X. Editors hated the shit out of this software back in June but after three substantial updates it’s proving to be just as powerful and intuitive as old FCP. I watched 3 hours of tutorials and have been happy with my workflow for the past few weeks.  
 
IMO: The first Final Cut was built for tabletop editors and the actual logistics of digital linear editing were improvised. FCPX was designed in response to the ENTIRE experience of using digital video. Importing makes more sense, fucker is crazy fast) but transcoding media and proxy media is incorporated into the software if you need it. Editing workflow is different (magnetic timeline….), I’m not as quick as I used to be but I’m getting there. I’m cutting music videos so I’m ignoring sound at the moment. The retiming features are incredible. Exporting has presets Youtube, Vimeo etc. along with the old presets and the usual Export to Compressor. I haven’t found myself getting angry at the software or befuddled by design choices. This thing is nothing like DVD Studio Pro, for example, which is the most difficult and poorly designed application I’ve ever had to learn. I’m having a good time.  

  .

*****
###*Update #1*  
I've been playing with the export presets (Vimeo, or QT when I try to open the export product. Not sure what the issue is yet. I am compressing mixed 1080p/720p (some Apple ProRes 422 HQ, a few clips in raw native DSLR) down to H.264 720p. Some old forum threads suggest switching codecs is a bad idea. And I should probably just transcode everything to ProRes as usual. I do eventually get a good export, the computer is just unhappy about it.

  .

###*Update #2*  
Gave up on the presets. Compressor is always a viable option and in this particular case it's also faster. System doesn't hang at all when using Compressor.",,t5_2quen,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/qero2/my_hackintosh_build_runs_like_a_dream_pics_fcpx/

I had to go out and purchase two Active adapters to run my 3rd and 4th monitors.  Apple sells Dual-Link DVI Active adapters, but those cost $99 a piece.  I found these [Accell Active Mini-Displayport to DVI adapters](http://www.amazon.com/Accell-B087B-006B-DisplayPort-Single-Link-Certified/dp/B004071ZXA) that don't require external power (supplied on the Dual-Link by USB) and run perfectly.

All I'm waiting on now is my bluetooth dongle to ship in from DealExtreme so I can use my wireless Apple keyboard and Magic Trackpad instead of my G15 gaming keyboard and MX Revolution mouse.

I followed the guide on insanelymac here: http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/topic/289062-109-mavericks-simple-vanilla-hackintosh-install-guide/

I had to do a few things differently

UPDATE: The preview is pretty stable so I migrated it over to my main drive and relegated a clone of my ML installation to a back up partition.

Setup: 

* OS: 10.8.3 /w unibeast
* Motherboard: GA-Z77X-UD3H
* Graphics Card: Saphire 6850
*Monitors: Dual over DVI

For multibeast I selected the atheros ethernet kext to get my internet working. I used the kernel flags darkwake=8


After installing the OS with unibeast I had the following problems:

* 1. VIA 2021 Audio did not work at all
* 2. Could not have two monitors enabled with GraphicsEnabler=Yes
* 3. USB 2.0 froze for ~1 minute after un-sleeping
* 4. USB 3.0 ports did not work

I resolved problem 3 and 4 by using GenericUSBXHCI.kext found online and setting an additional kernel parameter -gux_defer_usb2 to resolve the USB 2.0 port issue after sleeping.


Problem 2

* GraphicsEnabler=Yes 
* AtiConfig=Gibba
* AtiPorts=5


Finally


So


Now I have a completely working hackintosh that functions just like the real thing, dual monitors work, reset works, shutdown works, USB 3.0 and USB 2.0 work.

Hey all! 

For the last few months, and they've offered some great customization options for us. Many user-made designs have been submitted, including one I found that replicates an Apple-style keyboard in lettering and functionality. Currently everyone is voting on what designs will be available in the sale, and the voting period will end tomorrow morning, so get on it!

Some details on the keyboard:

- MSRP: $139.99
- Massdrop Price: 50 units = $120
- Switches: You will be able to decide between Cherry MX Blue, and Red switches ($10 additional charge for the red switches due to higher costs to WASD) at checkout.
- Additional WASD Accessories: These will also abe available at a discount at checkout

Timeline: 

1. The poll closes at 11am EST 9/18/12
2. Group Buy Starts at 1pm EST 9/18/12

Link to the poll (you'll have to create an account for free

If you'd like to vote for my Appley one, and [the original creator's blog post](http://www.clingmarks.com/custom-mac-mechanical-keyboard-lets-have-some-fun/893) which includes some final product photos and a custom configuration file for KeyRemap4Macbook (I've removed the angry birds space bar in my version).

**Description**

I am posting this because I thought others might be able to benefit from my experience.

This build has been great so far. The 660Ti is a very nice graphics card at a reasonable price

I used the Unibeast/Multibeast method to install Mountain Lion on it, but everything else was pretty much plug and play.

See the screenshot in the linked PCPartPicker page for my MultiBeast options.

Eventual plans for this build include one more hard drive (one SSD and one HDD for Windows and Mountain Lion

I thought I'd share something I noticed when building my system that some people may overlook

Anyway when you finish installing OS X and you feel like everything is working I suggest you do the following:

1. Run Geekbench (the trial version is adequate) and compare your CPU score with the existing benchmarks. If it's ok

2. Install HWmonitor and the plugins required using multibeast. Start HWmonitor and look for your CPU multiplier

The solution to this is quite simple. Using multibeast enable c and p states as boot options and install the core i5 SDST setting. For some reason the i5 patch will fix the i3 problem

The way to test that it works is to restart and then fire up HWmonitor again

I hope this helps some people out there who either A. Can't get past it or B. are running their CPU at half performance without even realising it.

Because the BIOS and ""about this Mac"" only report the maximum speed of the CPU

As usual with anything hackintosh based there's a risk that this could cause a kernel panic and an unbootable system so remember to back up and proceed with caution. ",,t5_2quen,1369409494.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/1ey1ba/tip_for_i3_usersbuilders/

Finally

I will soon be working remotely with my current company, I convinced my wife to let me upgrade. The original plan was just to upgrade CPU, mobo, and RAM. Since all of those were outdated and incompatible with new stuff, I had to upgrade them all at the same time. I ended up upgrading a few other things, mainly because my old stuff was just crap, but I went well over the originally planned $700 upgrade.

While picking parts, and gave me his old 580.

A few details about the install. After a few tries, ethernet and everything else seemed to work immediately, except for sound. However, I went ahead and ran Multibeast, but I never restarted. That night, I went to bed with the computer on, and let it put itself to sleep. Turns out that was a bad idea, while I was trying to boot, at one point after a restart, it would just take forever to give me the option to set my boot drive

So anyway, and ran Multibeast with pretty much the same options this guy selected: http://www.tonymacx86.com/user-builds/77030-ultrazones-master-audio-build-gigabyte-ga-z77x-ud5h-core-i7-3770k-32gb-ram-gigabyte-gtx-650-a.html

After running Multibeast this time, and my OSX SSD in the second slot, so I kept having to hit F12 and select my boot drive every time (it wasn't even giving me the option in BIOS to set my OSX SSD as first boot priority.)

So, I've never used it on my MBP either). I think the only other tweaks I made (besides switching the ports my SSDs were connected to), were to go into org.chameleon.Boot.plist, change the Timeout to 5 (so there was sufficient time to press a button in Chimera and select my boot drive when my wife wants to use Windows), and add one more string, ""Hide Partition"", to keep my extra data drives from showing up in Chimera.

In terms of kexts, though you have to use a utility (it isn't natively integrated with airport). ALC892 for sound, trim enabler, LNX2mac, graphicsEnabler=0, and IntelCPUnullpowermgt to prevent kernel panics (I couldn't get the flashed bios to work properly for native power management). I also had to use the usb 3 kext from the lion version of multibeast to get usb3 to work.

I plan to add a second 120GB SSD for Win7 and four 2TB drives for a 4TB RAID10 (data storage for OSX).  I also might upgrade the video card... that is the one thing I think I skimped on a little too much.

The Build

First you will need to acquire some software:
Unibeast (Follow TonyMacs steps for creating a Unibeast Drive)
http://tonymacx86.blogspot.com/2011/10/ ... using.html

Multibeast 4.3.2 (Place this on your Unibeast Drive after you have made the drive bootable)
C:Dq-OCPpT/MultiBeast-4.3.2.zip

Your motherboards DSDT (the link below is for my motherboard I listed above. Place this on your bootable Unibeast drive.)
DSDT/Database/DSDT-GA-Z68XP-UD3-F8.aml

Windows 7 (Buy it

Gigabyte Install CD Drivers (Comes with graphics card in box)
UD3 Mother Install Drivers (Comes with motherboard in box)

Boot1h (VERY IMPORTANT. I had to extract this myself so hopefully this file sharing site is efficient for it. Place this on your bootable drive)
http://uploading.com/files/f8mmb536/boot1h/

Setting your bios:
In order for your Mac to work properly you will need to set your Bios accordingly. If you do not your Mac will not work!! Here is an in depth video for your bios settings:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAkCmGOp1_U

Once your bios are done it is time! Dudududuahhhhhh!!!

Installing Mac OS X and Windows 7
First plug in your bootable Unibeast drive and a mouse.

Second start your computer and hold F12.

Next use the arrow keys to scroll down to USB-HDD and hit enter.

Your computer saying something along the lines of booting system with a lot of dots after it.

You will then see a menu with the name of your bootable drive. Make sure your bootable Unibeast drive is highlighted by using the arrow keys. Type ""GraphicsEnabler=No"" (no quotes) and press Enter. You will then be prompted with the Apple logo followed by the install screen.

Before you install anything we are going to partition your drive. Select English as your language and hit Enter. Use your mouse and click Utilities at the top and then select Disk Utility. 
http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vSU4uk5MzkY/T ... step+3.png

Select your computers main hard drive and select partition. You want 2 partitions. Name both and set one as Mac OS Journaled (Mac Partition) and one as MS-DOS (Windows Partition). Partition your disk and shutdown your computer. 

Next place your Windows CD inside of your DVD drive and install Windows. This is a fairly simple step-by-step process. Next install your Gigabyte and Ud3 Motherboard drivers. Windows side is now complete. Install any updates and shutdown.

Now because Windows is a jerk it will automatically set itself as your startup disk when you boot up. Simple hold F12

Now install Mac on your Mac partition by following the easy installer steps. Your computer should automatically restart. Now comes the tedious part. 

Once again hold F12 and select your USB-HDD. You will see the normal loading into the Unibeast launcher. Highlight your Mac partition

Launch Multibeast and do a custom UserDSDT install. Select the following options as well:

The -&gt; represent pathing. The last word in the path is what you check off.

System Utilities -&gt; Repair Permissions
Drivers and Bootloaders -&gt;Bootloaders -&gt;Chimera 1.9
Drivers and Bootloaders -&gt;Kexts and Enablers-&gt; Audio -&gt;Realtek (uncheck non-DSDT in drop down menu)
Drivers and Bootloaders -&gt;Kexts and Enablers-&gt;Disk -&gt; 3rd Party Sata
Drivers and Bootloaders -&gt; Network -&gt; Realtek Gigabyte Ethernet 2

Click continue and install. When this is finished Realtek will open and try to install. DO NOT DO IT YET. Your computer restarts when you do. Next go to spotlight (magnifying glass in the top right of your computer on the task bar). Type in chameleon. In the list you will see org.Chameleon.Boot.list. Open it and paste the following inside

&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC ""-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN"" ""http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd""&gt;
&lt;plist version=""1.0""&gt;
&lt;dict&gt;
&lt;key&gt;AtiConfig&lt;/key&gt;

***You have two choices here. Do not add anything in stars.***

&lt;string&gt;Bulrushes&lt;/string&gt;
*****(Lower FPS may lag in games but enables DVI port)*****
or
&lt;string&gt;Lotus&lt;/string&gt;
*****(I run Lotus to play Starcraft smoothly through HDMI)******




&lt;key&gt;AtiPorts&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;string&gt;4&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;key&gt;Darkwake&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;string&gt;0&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;key&gt;EthernetBuiltIn&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;string&gt;Yes&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;key&gt;GenerateCStates&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;string&gt;Yes&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;key&gt;GeneratePStates&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;string&gt;Yes&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;key&gt;GraphicsEnabler&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;string&gt;Yes&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;key&gt;Kernel&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;string&gt;mach_kernel&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;key&gt;Kernel Flags&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;string&gt;arch=i386 npci=0x2000&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;key&gt;Legacy Logo&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;string&gt;Yes&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;key&gt;Timeout&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;string&gt;3&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;key&gt;UseKernelCache&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;string&gt;Yes&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;/dict&gt;
&lt;/plist&gt;

After you do this we are going to steal the boot back from Windows. This means you will automatically boot into Mac when your computer starts. If you do not want this

Finally we are almost done. Install the Realtek audio I told you not to install earlier and restart.

Hold F12 and boot through your USB-HDD again. Type GraphicsEnabler=No and launch from your install

In terminal
diskutil list

Locate the location of your Mac partition mine for instance is Disk1s2. This means Hard Drive 1 partition 2.

Now type:
cd /Volumes/BootableDrive (Replace Bootable Drive with the name of your drive. Some call it BOOT some call it Lion. Whatever you named it during the Unibeast process that is what it is called. If you have a space replace the space with \ . So named USB Drive is actually ""USB\ Drive"". Once you have changed directories (thats what cd means in Terminal) type:
dd if=boot1h of=/dev/identifier 

This will copy the boot1h I gave you above to your Hard Drive. It will say transferring so much data

http://imgur.com/I3kVMjF

I got it up and running in January and it's been *pretty stable* since the last OS X update (Final Cut was shitting the bed before that). I even got Messages working! However

* Keyboard (USB or Bluetooth) need to be responsive: 80% success rate
* App store purchases need to acknowledge that they're on the right computer: 50% success rate
* Drobo Pro (direct ethernet/eSCSI connection) needs to recognize that it's plugged in to something and come out of sleep mode: 20% success rate
* Firewire card needs to work: 100% earlier

So my Hackintosh is fast and incredible when all systems are up and running, but not others. On the off chance that I get a KP or need to restart for software, everything comes to a screeching halt for a few hours while I try to get it all working again. I can't deal with this when I have impending deadlines. 

I feel like I've made a big mistake with this investment. I would be happy to trade the horsepower and obscene number of ports in my Hackintosh for a loaded 27"" iMac.

My ultimate question is this: what is the best way for me to unload this machine, but it feels like used computer parts without their packaging wouldn't have much value, and I'd end up with a pile of leftover pieces. How do I minimize the damage?

The only issues I have are that Lion won't recognize two of my four Sata 3 ports (recognized in Bios, I understand). Also, it won't wake from deep sleep, but that's a well known Lion problem, and it doesn't bother me at all. Other issues (5xx enabling, USB 3.0, wireless) were simple fixes I either found here or on TonyMac.

I grabbed that old Crysis Q6600 rig, now retired for its sheer fan noise and aging hardware, and loaded up Mountain Lion on it with no trouble what so ever, it was a 15 minute install and everything worked! Then I grabbed a couple of Ivy Bridge-based oem machines I had lying around (Pick them up for pennies when they come off corporate lease from a friend), and gave it a go on those. AGAIN, everything worked flawlessly with their integrated graphics and ethernet working perfectly. I now have 4 working hacks in a single evening

She also plans to play Simcity in March. I suggested selling the iMac on [Ebay](http://www.ebay.com/ctg/Apple-iMac-21-5-Desktop-MB950LL-A-October-2009-/79546766?_tab=1&amp;_trksid=p2047675.l2644#req_6_all_1_55033.com) as the resale value is quite good ($600-$800) with that i promised she could have a no compromise Mac OSX replacement with minor extra funds to make up the difference.

So with that i have a mission. Build a mac for girl that doesn't want to even know its not genuine

*1st issue was eliminating Mini-ITX because i would need 2 PCIe slots one for gpu and the other for a compatible PCIe Wireless adapter (AFAIK no Mobo supports both onboard BT and WIFI) That narrowed down the chassis search to M-ATX. Although it wouldn't have been my first choice for some reason she gravitated to the Thermaltake Lanbox Lite w/ Window. She even plans on buying it now and painting it some sort of glossy purple.

*Issue #2. GPU choice: 660ti 

Basically I'm hoping this configuration is going to do the trick with minimal hassle. I myself built a gaming PC and as a side project down the road i installed OSX but my video card acceleration was unsupported. it sucks!

Opinions?

I posted this in /r/battlestations last week and thought I'd share with you guys too. So I finished my dual boot Win 7 / Mountain Lion build. Decided to go wireless with the peripherals after being inspired by another Hackintosh post on that sub. Using Lifehacker's [ Always Up-to-Date Guide to Building a Hackintosh](http://lifehacker.com/5841604/the-always-up+to+date-guide-to-building-a-hackintosh) as a rough guide I installed my App Store copy of ML via UniBeast, which other than that worked out of the box.

**Optical Drive** | [Lite-On iHOS104-06 Blu-Ray/DVD/CD Drive](http://pcpartpicker.com/uk/part/lite-on-optical-drive-ihos10406)

The reason for the varied drives is that two of them (Samsung 830 128gb SSD and the 1tb barracuda hdd) are from my PC's previous incarnation as a straight gaming PC (motherboard and GPU have changed since then). The Caviar green was an external drive that I popped open using a guide from YouTube, and the Barracuda 1tb for Windows Steam games.

I'm using a [TP Link TL-WDN4800 450Mbps Wireless N Dual Band PCI Express Adapter](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B006PMX964/ref=oh_details_o06_s00_i00) for wifi
The bluetooth dongle I'm using for the wireless keyboard is the [Belkin USB Bluetooth 100m adaptor](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Belkin-Bluetooth-Adapter-100m-Range/dp/B001BRV7JE/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1349990995&amp;sr=8-5).
The Logitech mouse has its own little dongle which is plugged in to one of the rear usb ports. The Filco Majestouch II is for gaming.

The only issues I had were the that the CPU seemed to be being throttled in ML against my wishes, which more than doubled the geekbench score (results are in the imgur album). AFAIK Ivy Bridge CPU's don't have this issue, which is why it didn't crop up in the golden build guide I used. The CPU is currently overlocked to 4GHz.

The only outstanding issue is that the keyboard battery constantly displays 100% in system preferences

Overall I'm really happy with this build and the experience has been awesome. I strongly recommend this motherboard to anyone looking for an easy to work with board.

Hi all

&amp;#160;

I'll likely be doing most of my gaming under Windows. Really looking forward to playing Diablo III once my finals are over. From looking at benchmarks it seems like I'll be able to run it with maxed settings at 1080. Same with Starcraft II.

&amp;#160;

Most of my normal usage will be on OS X. I do a bit of web design here and there so I'll be running Photoshop concurrently with Dreamweaver and other apps. I have a bit of a bad habit leaving a bunch of applications open

&amp;#160;

I'll also use it for some bedroom DJ'ing running Traktor

&amp;#160;

So I guess my questions to you guys are:

&amp;#160;

1. Does all my hardware look compatible with each other and with installing OS X? I got the MoBo off the Tonymac list so I assume that's fine. Does the manufacturer of the graphics card matter or will the XFX card be just as compatible as the Gigabyte one suggested by Tonymac?

2. I know it's recommended to have two HD's for dual booting

3. How is my power supply? Sufficient?

&amp;#160;

I built this machine about 9 months ago with the intention of building a hackintosh / windows gaming PC. Snow Leopard was a partial success

I attempted another Snow Lion install, which was painless after the 3rd attempt. I mostly screwed up the drivers in MultiBeast.

A few things I found out along the way:

* On my particular motherboard
* Don't blindly install all the audio drivers in MultiBeast - the system will panic upon boot.

This thing screams compared to my 2006 21"" iMac Core Duo (of course). It feels more responsive than Win 7 and any of the 30 linux distros I tried on it. 

Todo: 

* Fix up bluetooth (I have a D-Link DBT-120 dongle that's supposed to work
* Reinstall my Win 7 drive and set up chameleon to dual boot
* Find some utilities to monitor temperature sensors

That was until today when I finally had some time to hackintosh her PC and get it running 10.7.2 using UniBeast, and the 10.7.2 Combo update. Everything went pretty well. I had some issues with MultiBeast stepping on its own toes (it creates a locked folder on the desktop for two seperate kext installs. If the folder exists already the updates will fail, so the second of the two kexts always fails on install... sigh) and audio didn't work out of the box.

As I said, but I've heard that this amount isn't necessary. I like to play games as well, so a Windows partition and capabilities to run the latest games are a priority. Also a priority is having blazing fast render speeds for Final Cut. I need a motherboard that will be compatible with Hackintosh. Also, a huge harddrive because HD video takes a lot of space.

Anyway

-Antec Three Hundred Case
-Gigabyte X58A-UD3R 
-3.2 Ghz Quad-core Intel i7 960
-6 GB of 1333 Triple Channel Ram
-1GB 5770 ATI Radeon GPU
-60 GB OCZ SSD
-1TB HD
-Run of the mill Optical Drive
-H50 Water Cooling System on the CPU + 3 more 120mm fans

Here is my advice

1) Read A LOT before buying parts and building your computer. I probably spent close to 3 weeks researching my build and how to build a computer before I invested the $1200 this machine ended up costing me. I'm very glad I did. And

2) Don't get discouraged. I ran into one problem with the iBoot+Multibeast route that literally took me around 5 straight hours to solve. Honestly

3) I spent so much time researching where to buy the cheapest version of the parts I wanted. My conclusion is that Microcenter is the best place to buy most parts if you have one close by. I bought my CPU for $179, and the Optical Drive...

4) Anti-Static Wrist Strap. It's a safety precaution, but don't build anywhere near carpet. 

That's all I've got. Just thought I'd drop by and let everyone know that building a Hackintosh is totally possible

**Intel Core i7-970 Gulftown 3.2GHz Six-Core Desktop Processor - $564**
I've heard this matches the performance of the of the 8 core Xeon Mac Pro configuration. Video editing programs are really good at taking advantage of multiple cores

**GIGABYTE GA-X58A-UD3R LGA 1366 Intel X58 SATA 6Gb/s USB 3.0 ATX Intel Motherboard - $209**
People have suggested the UD5 over the UD3. Don't really know which one to choose.

**COOLER MASTER Storm Sniper SGC-6000-KXN1-GP Black Steel
It comes with one 120mm rear fan

**G.SKILL Ripjaws Series 8GB (2 x 4GB) 240-Pin DDR3 SDRAM DDR3 1333 (PC3 10666) - $84**
It's a pretty decent start. Definitely needs to be upgraded eventually to take advantage of tripple channel.

**COOLER MASTER Silent Pro M600 RS-600-AMBA-D3 600W ATX12V V2.3 SLI Certified CrossFire Ready 80 PLUS Bronze Certified - $79 with rebate**

1364215083.0,1ayxb6,My experiences building my first hackintosh,XmaGe,10,1,11,"Hi

I have just finished my first hackintosh. I had thought about doing it years ago but the asus p5ne-sli motherboard did not have much support.

I stumbled onto the [tonymac86 website](http://www.tonymacx86.com/home.php) where the buyer's guide was especially useful.

My system 

* Intel Core i7 3770K

* Noctua NH-D14 CPU Cooler 

* NZXT PHANTOM Full Tower case PSU White 

* Thermaltake TR-800P TR2 RX 800W 

* Gigabyte GA-Z77X-UD5H 

* SanDisk Extreme SSD 240G 

* TP-LINK TL-WDN4800 

* Corsair 16GB (2x8GB) 

* Asus GTX680 DirectCU II Edition PCI-E 3.0

I installed mountain lion 10.8.2 and used multibeast to setup with some settings I dug out of some forums. I had a few issues before I switched to the chameleon boot loader. Also the first time I ran OSX for some reason my user had no admin access

The only issues so far is the motherboard I have is a ver 1 which has issues with the green audio output port but the black one works. Also I have no idea to get audio via hdmi. Also my pc keyboard (logitech g110) and mouse (logitech G9x) do not wake the computer. Instead I press the power button and log in.

Apart from that my computer is great. Still waiting on a blue tooth dongle and a compatible dvd drive.

I am very happy so far. Part of me wants to upgrade to 10.8.3 but I don't want to break my setup. I think I might build a mini for my lounge room.

Also my room mate who has a mac book pro is eyeing a system for herself so maybe that will be the next project.",,t5_2quen,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/1ayxb6/my_experiences_building_my_first_hackintosh/

1347239928.0,zmoet,[Update]Turning an old iMac screen into an external monitor,DylanDecree,14,3,1,"I posted last week about turning an old iMac screen into an external monitor: http://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/z13du/turning_old_imac_screen_into_an_external_monitor/

I have emailed a well known iMac modder named Dremel Junkie (http://www.dremeljunkie.com/) and he responded with a rough guide on what should be achieved. Previous commenters asked if I can post my progress or any information and I thought I would follow through before really working on this project with the amazing information I learned from Dremel Junkie.


**Here is the email:**
&gt;The LG LM201W01-STB2 is a 16:10 CCFL backlit 20.1"" 1650x1080 LCD panel that uses TMDS signaling and is found in power pc iMac 20"" G5s with iSight cameras.  To do this mod, it tells the backlights to turn on.  The backlights are ccfl or led bulbs behind the LCD.  The image would be too dark to see without a backlight. The backlights are powered by the same power source via an inverter.  In fact in many monitors, the power source and inverter are fused together on one board using the AC current directly from the plug.  In other monitors with CCFL backlights DC from the power source passes through an inverter where it becomes AC with a very high voltage (and is dangerous).
&gt;
&gt;The iMac G5 iSight panel you have works slightly differently.  It accepts TMDS signals.  Examples of TMDS include both HDMI and DVI.  So to put it simply, it's just not visible.  Inside the monitor is a Texas instruments chip that converts TMDS to LVDS, so in a way the controller is part of the LCD.  The all in one iMacs could do this because they only accepted one channel using one type of signal (didn't need a board to switch between VGA and HDMI for instance).  The motherboard also hooked right into the inverter, so it controlled the backlights directly.  The alteration of the image (ie contrast, hue, saturation) was handled on the motherboard side by software controls.  This allowed for the Controller to be simplified enough to be put in the LCD itself.  But, as I stated before the controller also gave the LCD it's power. As the controller is inside
&gt;
&gt;DVI/HDMI Image Channels using TMDS.  There are 4 TMDS image channels.  They are 0,&amp;Clock.  These are red, green, blue, and clock. Each of these is made up of a 3 wire bundle with includes a positive, negative, and a shield.  So, data
&gt;
&gt;Now let's talk about the LCDs power, there is also a trick you have to do to the DVI where the source comes from to get it to know its connected, but that is explained in detail in the 20"" mod.  So here is the Pinout.  Ignore the colors (they are for iMac g4 identification only).

&gt;
&gt;And here is the 20"" blog post.
&gt;http://www.dremeljunkie.com/2011/11/all-in-one-20-imac-g4-genuine-tmds-to.html
&gt;
&gt;So now
&gt;
&gt;Some options:
&gt;Wire it up individually - you'd need a 30 pin JAE connector with pins that connects via TMDS wire (from HDMI or dvi cable) and then connect both the inverter and LCD to an adequate power source.
&gt;
&gt;Use the guts from an aluminum 20"" apple cinema display.  This contains the wiring already made

I obviously know how to power down and install new processors

will it boot without problems?

This summer I decided to install it anyway as most of the compatibility issues were gone. I've been changing some components on the way and the build looks like this now: 

* Asus P8P67
* i5 2500K
* GTX 560ti
* 8Gb 1600mhz ram
* Crucial M4 128gb for Mountain Lion + apps
* Crucial M4 128gb for Windows 7 + games
* Samsung Spinpoint 750Gb for photos and videos
* Iomega 2Tb external for movies and TV shows
* Random 160gb for Time Machine
* Belkin Bluetooth adapter 

Keyboard and trackpad are Apple and the mouse is Logitech Performance MX. The mouse is using Logitech's own bluetooth adapter but with the keyboard and trackpad I had a little trouble finding a working adapter first.

There's no reliable way to check if the hardware you currently own would be (partially) compatible or not. **The best way to go around this is to use known/recommended builds from others.** That's the first part.

Regular motherboards will not boot into this OS from standard media. You need to add a step in between. **This steps lets you boot into an environment where the Mac OS thinks it's installing into a Mac, as the OS itself restricts itself to a certain set of hardware.

So.. **Get compatible hardware




Now I have some concerns. I read some things about the Unibeast/Multibeast method, is there to eliminate this requirement?

Now I've already tried this Unibeast/Multibeast method, and I really don't have enough understanding about troubleshooting these specific errors.

Anyway, however it is all Gigabyte sells anymore, so I put it as the next best thing.

Any glaring issue?  Could anyone point me in the right direction to find the DSDT for my motherboard?  (I seem to find a lot of DSDT's for the PRO and Deluxe version

 Also

SSD: Boot for both OSX and Windows

1 TB HDD: Data for OSX and Windows

320 GB HDD (salvaged from laptop): Ubuntu boot/data


Or would I have to do a set up like:
SSD: Boot for windows

1 TB HDD: Data for Windows/OSX boot+data

320 GB HDD: Ubuntu boot/data.

Or would neither of these?  Sorry

Thanks in advance!

Okay

Okay! So let's get started for what to expect from this

----The Rig---

My Specs are

CPU: i5 2500k @ 5.0Ghz (I over clock but you don't have to.)

MotherBoard: Z77E-ITX using the Modded 1.60 Bios

GPU: GALAXY GTX680 GC 4GB (I would actually recommend a 2GB card

RAM: Corsair Vengeance 2x4GB 1600Mhz CL9 Kit (What ever you want

SSD/HDD: OCZ Agility 3 120GB (OS) + OCZ Vertex 3 120GB (Data/Scrub) (I know I did it backwards but I already had the Agility 3 mounted and I couldn't be bothered to switch it around after I installed the OS.)


----THE PRE-INSTALLATION----

Okay

1. I would reset your bios to stock settings so that the bios install will go without issues

2. Download the modded bios from HERE(http://bios.zmac.net/asrock/Asrock-Z77E-ITX-160_modified.zip)! and throw it on a flash drive so that you can pull it up later.

3. Install it. Just use the flash utility on the board it should just detect the bios file. After you install let it do it's thing it will flash on and off

4. After it installs

Now you are good to go to the REAL install phase.

---Install---

There are two methods to this

1. Make a mac that can install Mountain Lion and Unibeast. &lt;--- The Manly way.

2. Have a mac that can install Mountain Lion and Unibeast. &lt;--- Preferred


---Install Method 1---

This is the method for if you are starting fresh you have no Macs around or you can't be bothered to get one

---Installing Snow Leopard---

WHAT YOU NEED

A Snow Leopard install disk

A DVD Burner / Drive

An iBoot Disk image(http://www.tonymacx86.com/downloads)

A CD

You will want to burn the iBoot Disk Image to a blank CD using any sort of ISO Burner.

Set your bios to Boot form CD-Rom First so you can easily access your iBoot every time.

Once you boot to the iBoot CD you will want to take the disk out and place the Snow Leopard disk in the drive. Once you do so hit F5 until ""Mac OS X Install Disk"" appears in the menu. Before you select it be sure to type ""PCIRootUID=1"" Otherwise you will get a gnarly kernel panic and you will have to reboot.

Now that you are greeted with the installer you will want to open Disk Utility and format your OS Drive for Mac OS Extended (Journaled) make sure that you set the partition to GUID. I named it OS for sake of this. After you do so just install OS X to the disk OS.

Once it finishes and restarts reinsert iBoot disk back into the drive.

Select ""OS"" or whatever you named it and type ""PCIRootUID=1"" again. It should boot up into OS X Snow Leopard.

You'll get a cool welcome screen and will be asked to set things up

---Updating to 10.6.8---

What you need.
 
1. Mac OS X 10.6.8 ComboUpdate(http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1399)

2.MultiBeast http://www.tonymacx86.com/downloads

3. Update Helper(http://www.tonymacx86.com/downloads)
If you are awesome like me and you have a Sandybridge processor you will need it.

4. Broadcom Kext(Driver)(http://www.osx86.net/view/1883-broadcom_bcm57781_lion.html)

Now you will want to open MultiBeast and mount and install the combo update. DO NOT REBOOT!!!!!! Switch to MultiBeast and if it closes re-open it.

Now you will be in MultiBeast get to the customization menu it is after the ToS agreement. You will want to use

1. EasyBeast

2. System Utilites

3 Customization -&gt; Boot -&gt; PCI Root ID Fix

Install it 

Eject iBoot

Restart

---Install ethernet driver---

Now you will want to ins all your ethernet driver so you can have internet to download mountain lion. 

Go to your applications folder and open Kext Helper Drag your Broadcom Kext into the white box and install.

Restart and you should have internet.

Now you can continue to Method 2

---Method 2---

You will need:

1. A Download of Mountain Lion form the App Store a tormented copy won't work.(Mac App Store
)

2. Unibeast 1.6(http://www.tonymacx86.com/downloads)

3. 8GB or larger flash drive

---Creating a Bootable Disk---

Open Disk Utility

Select The 8GB Drive

Select partitions

Click current and set it to 1 Partition

Click options and set it to Master Boot Record

Name it USB

Format it as Mac OS Extended (Journaled) 

And apply.

---Uniibeast---

Open Uniibeast and follow the prompts skip the prompt about legacy and laptop support it's not needed.

Boot from the USB and select USB from the Unibeast loader.

Partition your drive using Disk Utility make sure it is one partition and is using GUID partition method as well as Mac OS Extended (Journaled) format

Restart

Boot again from USB this time choosing ""OS""

Since the Z77e-ITX doesn't have ethernet support from UniBeast you will need to download these files from another computer.

1. KextHelper (http://code.google.com/p/g60jx-hackintosh/downloads/detail?name=Kext%20Helper%20b7.zip&amp;can=2&amp;q=%22)

2. Mountian Lion Ethernet Kext (http://www.tonymacx86.com/attachments/golden-builds/32446d1348410006-asrock-z77e-itx-core-i7-3770k-evga-gtx-570hd-ionetworkingfamily.kext.zip)

3. USB 3.0 Kext (http://www.tonymacx86.com/general-hardware-discussion/70384-hopefully-near-universal-usb-3-0-driver-3rd-part-controllers-10-8-x.html)

4. Working Audio DSDT File (You will want to rename it to DSDT.aml) (http://www.tonymacx86.com/attachments/golden-builds/41179d1355596164-asrock-z77e-itx-core-i7-3770k-evga-gtx-570hd-dsdt.aml.audio.zip)

5. Multibeast for Mountain Lion (http://www.tonymacx86.com/downloads)

--Installing Kexts and Other settings---

Using Kext helper install the the Ethernet and USB 3.0 Kexts.

Open Multibeast. use the settings as listed here (http://www.tonymacx86.com/members/buckeyes1995/albums/hack-stuff/41177-multibeast-settings.jpg)

After that finishes copy the renamed DSDT.aml file to the /OS/Extra folder

And there you go you should have Mountain Lion working with minimal issues.

---Appstore Fix for SandyBridge---

1. add the following to your org.chameleon.Boot.plist:

&lt;key&gt;device-properties&lt;/key&gt; &lt;string&gt;4b00000001000000010000003f0000000100000002 010c00d041030a0000000001010600031c0101060000007fff 0400160000006200750069006c0074002d0069006e00000005 00000001&lt;/string&gt; 

2. In System Preference-&gt;Network remove ethernet/wifi devices

3. Delete /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/NetworkInterfaces.plist

4. Reboot

5. In System Preferences-&gt;Network add ethernet THEN wifi

I am still undecided on the RAM

RAM: I'm not sure if losing 4 GB is worth saving $18.

PSU: I'm not sure if the 430W 80 PLUS will be better than the similarly priced 70% efficiency 550W

GPU: I'm not sure if the slight upgrade on the GTX 650 is worth $30 over the GTX 550 Ti

Questions: Most of my questions pertain to the thunderbolt display.  I'd like to be able to use the thunderbolt display in OS X with the 660 Ti acceleration and OpenCL.  There is something to be said for FaceTime and I'm absolutely a huge fan of using iChat for remote support for family.  I'd like to know that the Thunderbolt Display will work with this build even though I'll initially be using the build with a Dell Display.  Also

Tomorrow is the day that I will likely decide to pull the trigger!  I'm excited and nervous; I've been a forum member for years but I'm locked out of my account for some reason (I know there was a technology transition recently).

* Corsair 16GB 1600Mhz DDR3
* Corsair Professional 650watt modular power supply (expensive
* Corsair 120GB SSD
* Sony Optiarc DVD-RW AD-7280S

As I have a compatible motherboard I used the latest Kakewalk followed by MultiBeast with [this configuration](http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8164/7155386508_2e65da8ef4_b.jpg). Once MultiBeast was run, etc. as best as I can tell.

I'm encoding some video at the moment and WOW

A few quirk on the install:

* The 16GB Verbatim USB key that I used for the install is quirky as it only works in some of the USB ports. Other USB sticks work just fine. As a result
* [FIXED - see below] When I restart the machine I *sometimes* get an automatic restart during POST. It will get to the screen where it's about to load into OS X and instead power off and power back on. By all accounts this is a hardware issue as it happened before the SSD was even installed. Any ideas?

Follow-up thoughts:

* I'm looking to improve boot times. The OS X boot is great
* I'd like to tax this thing to really test its stability. Any suggestions?
* Bluetooth is a must. I'm off to research some dongles.

A big thanks to everyone on the other thread! 

UPDATE:

* My Geekbench 2 score with no tweaking is 13200
* I have full Bluetooth functionality using a Belkin F8T003 dongle
* The computer survived a 6 hour Geekbench 2 stress test with no averse function
* The restart during POST was fixed by enabling Quick Boot in the BIOS

Please help me navigate the sea of information. **Major** concerns:

1. **HDD config** - Currently I use SSD for Win7 boot+BF3, movies, documents, backups, etc. I intend on using the 250GB drives for mac boot, programs, etc. 
**Question**- Can I use my current 1TB mirror array as a single data volume in OSX in similar fashion?! Can't risk corruption or breaking my mirror setup. 

2. **USB Boot drive vs internal SATA** - I'd love to be able to use the 250GB OSX drive as an external HDD via USB. I'd put the drive in an 2.5"" drive enclosure and boot from it when I want to use OSX. This is way less invasive than having to install the drive in the tower

3. **Snow Leopard vs Lion** - I currently own Snow Leopard retail disc but have not upgrade my original 2006 macbook to Lion. Its incompatible. **Question** Any objective reason to use Lion over Snow Leopard with my setup?

I put mac on the big drive and windows on the small one. [Here's a crappy shot of the guts.](http://i.imgur.com/vb9NS.jpg) I need too work on the cables a bit

This amazes me, its fast. And speaking of fast...[Geekbench score is clocking in over 10K in mac](http://i.imgur.com/q5DLu.png). I don't have 64bit Geekbench for windows, but I'm getting scores about 500-1000 points less in Windows 7 currently, which is weird, not sure why that is. 

So...build complete, it uses USB to power itself, so essentially you dont see any screen info on the Apple Display untill it gets power from the USB on the mobo, meaning the screen is blank during the whole startup phase, so you can't browse your BIOS or basic setup info, which also makes it tricky if not impossible to dual boot. So essentially...stuck with the cheap Dell screen I got Best Buy for the time being.  

And one last note, I get on average temps between 30C-50C. The highest it went was after a few too many hours of Skyrim.

500W PSU was included with the case which was actually a Cooler Master 431 Plus.

To be used primarily for playing Dota 2

Here's the logic behind my choices:

* I knew I was going for an Intel processor and nVidia graphics for hackintosh compatibility reasons
* I went with mini-ITX because I plan to keep the machine on top of my desk rather than under it
* I went with Haswell because OH NEW SHINY
* I went with the cheapest quad-core Haswell because it seemed like a good compromise between cost and performance
* I went with the Gigabyte wifi mobo because it's hackintosh compatible out of the box

My thinking here is to have a separate HDD for each OS. The case has room for extra HDDs or SSDs when I might need them. Music Production

I have a few questions before I go and drop too much money on this thing.

1. Firstly
3. Is this build going to overheat and die on me without a CPU cooler in there? The case I've chosen has 4 fans included and space for 7 more

So, virtualization did not want to work. From there, I tried going the AMD route (har har, funny, right?). I had a ton of trouble. I eventually got it going, but it was just a hassle to get anything done with the hardware I had.

The need to run OSX was getting to me. So, bought Mountain Lion and installed without a hitch. I got everything working minus sleep (the graphics card I suspect). She runs like a beaut.

I have a couple hard drives from my old regular PC build that I swapped into here. Reformatted them 379GB (NTFS)/121GB (GUID) and SuperDuper!'d my OSX install from my SSD to that specially partition so I could install Windows 8 to the SSD (I mainly did that just to see since the motherboard is designed for Windows 8 and wanted to check out boot times).

I'm a Mac-based musician looking to treat myself to a slave audio PC that could also double as a Hackintosh depending on how things go. I have a fairly old Mac Pro (3, PCs are less problematic and better overall when it comes to this brute force audio processing

However, but I'm deathly afraid to update from Snow Leopard on my main rig because of the software problems that might arise. So there's some motivation to get the Hackintosh aspect up and running!

I've been doing some research, sound card, and optical drive - I'm not sure about the direction I'm taking the first three, the last one I won't need at all. Oh and I'll be using my existing keyboard through a KVM switch.

The biggest questions and notes are the following:

* The ability to have tons of RAM drawing from my SSDs is the most important aspect of this build - now, new 2011 CPUs are coming out next year...

* Should I bother with faster/different RAM? Worth it?

* *Heat / Silence / Case:* I'm not going to overclock, what would a decent, quiet-ish solution be?

Thanks so much! Looking forward to jumping on post-Xmas sales!

1350921212.0,11wemb,Help! Impossible to setup RAID1 storage on dual-boot Lion/Win7??,iscribble,12,2,4,"I've asked in the [OSx86.net forum](http://www.osx86.net/10-7-lion/19166-help-hardware-raid-storage-possible.html) as well as the [tonymacx86 forum](http://www.tonymacx86.com/general-help/54010-setting-up-raid-0-dual-boot-windows-7-mac-osx.html#post475197)

**The Why:**
My wife's hackintosh is dual-booting Lion/Win7 both from the same physical disk (SSD). For all of her work, the exFAT partition corrupted. I recovered 98% of everything, but my wife wanted me to make sure that wouldn't happen again. Naturally, my thoughts turned to RAID1.

**The Goal:**
I'd like to setup a RAID1 so that the entire disk is mirrored and the logical drives look the same as they always did in both Lion and Win7.

**Steps taken so far:**

1. First
2. My first go-to was to RAID with hardware using the motherboard. As soon as I swiched away from AHCI
3. Once I had things booting with the BIOS set to RAID
4. I tried using the disk utility to create a software RAID on the MAC side... but there are two problems to that: it destroyed the HW RAID and it wouldn't let me setup an exFAT RAID.
5. After searching the web and coming up with no help

**Hardware:** 
Z68MX-UD2H-B3 v1.3 (Marvell 88SE9172 SATA controller)

**Ideas:**

* I read somewhere that this might be possible with the on-board controller if I get the right AHCIPortInjector.kext? Does that exist?
* Hardware-controlled RAID is possible if you go buy a 3rd party RAID controller

Or is this effort truly a pipe-dream?",,t5_2quen,1350922727.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/11wemb/help_impossible_to_setup_raid1_storage_on/

First

After, I would manually boot from the USB stick (I also tried booting from the SSD which I had on Port 0 and it didn't seem to be any different than booting from the USB stick).

I ended up checking the verbose boot and found that it hung with the last line being ""[IOBluetoothHCIController][start] -- completed"" but when booting with safemode

I still can only boot in safe mode and It will not start without the USB Drive plugged in. Also, I don't know what to do.

Other than that, except I didn't know what was important. What should I be looking for in a card?

When I had bought all my parts, so kakewalk didn't work as planned. Got it running but had all sorts of problems… this began 3 days of tinkering between working my job.

Before installing, so I decided I to go ahead and install windows 7, use Easy BCD to set up dual boot, then I could get to both. I tinkered with my kakewalk install for awhile before deciding to scrap it. Tried the Unibeast method, couldn't get past the load screen to the installer. Tried kakewalk again and suddenly I couldn't do ANYTHING on the OSX side. Searched for awhile, and found something called [My Hack](http://myhack.sojugarden.com/guide/). 

The flash drive installer is as simple to set up as any of the other methods

All in all this thing flies. I had been using my macbook pro (late 2008) as a desktop for the past year (hooked up to wireless keyboard and dvi with an external cd drive) since it would no longer hold a charge

Everything shows up like it should, so if anyone is having issues with other install methods, give it a shot, worked for me.

Side note, but for right now, 10.7 it is.

If anyone has a suggestion for a good gfx card (make/brand) I should should go with for a low to mid range price with good punch that is easy to install let me know

So I am pretty much bugging out. pretty excited and pretty nervous. First time computer build and hackintosh. 

Total with shipping was about 800. 

Here comes the total noob question number 1

1. Do I need to install snow leopard before upgrading to 10.7?

2. Is there a link somewhere on tonymac (that I can't find) for this exact build. Like the settings and what not. Is Kakewalk easier for this build or the Iboot+multibeast. Thanks guys and wish me luck! ",,t5_2quen,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/qedr1/it_has_been_ordered/

So I plan to start with this on Windows 7 and eventually get 2 SSD's to boot Windows and OS X separately. My main concern is the 580. I read [here at tonymac](http://tonymacx86.com/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;t=28975&amp;start=0) that it's possible to use the 580 (even works in SLI, is the 120Hz monitor too much? I wanted to try 3D gaming eventually, so I figured I might as well get the 120Hz monitor out of the way now.

I have matched All my bios settings to the guides. I have checked and rechecked. Another thing that is strange is that I can boot to snow leopard with iBoot

I spent about an hour this morning getting from 10.6.3 up to 10.6.8. That was around 8AM. Now it's 5:35pm and I'm no further and it's a bit frustrating to have wasted that much time. ANY help is much appreciated.

When I decided that I need two cards I added the second one and tried [THIS GUIDE](http://www.tonymacx86.com/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;t=8660&amp;start=20).  I immediately started getting kernel panics again. I tweaked and tweaked and the only way I've gotten the computer to boot into OSX is when I do npci0x2000 (essentially a safe mode for graphics cards) and removing the hex string from org.chameleon.boot.plist

*I also read somewhere that DSDT edits are almost always better for upgrading to a new version of OSX without having to change much and I'd prefer to make this thing run perfectly by adding the hex code to the DSDT to enable my dual GPU's rather than the org.chameleon.boot.plist.*

For the sake of getting this thing running before I actually break down and try to edit (or have Tonymac edit) my DSDT, OR how I am copying the hex string into my org.chameleon.boot.plist file in Extra.  It might also have something to do with weird quirks that Gigabyte boards have where you need to boot from PCI slot #2 (""PEG2""? or am I misinterpreting this step?), though I have tried that a few times too.

* Gigabyte GA-Z68X-UD7-B3 motherboard (Firmware 9)

* i7 2700K 3.5Ghz CPU

* 2x 250 GB SSD's @ SATAIII speeds (Corsair Performance Pro for OSX and Vertex 3 for the Windows 7 boot drive I'm using to type this)

The graphics card is my old Zotec 9800GT 512MB and I'll upgrade that next. It works fine with TF2 which is all I play lately. The three WD 750GB drives are in Raid0 for video work. I also had another Samsung 2TB internal HD for music and movies but had it move it to a USB 3.0 enclosure as this motherboard only has 6 SATA ports. I wish I had noticed that before buying as the external 3.0 drive cuts out from time to time on Lion.

The upgrade only cost me $540 to go from a Core 2 duo system to an i7 with 16GB of RAM. This is why I love building my own PCs. The difference in time waiting for a render between my old and new systems is huge.

My Case is the earlier 690.

Yes

I chose to have 2x 120 gb SSD as well as a 1tb HDD. I plan to install one OS on each SSD, all of it sitting inside the chassis.

For the GPU's, I will rely on just one of the cards, as all my gaming will take place on my 7.

Ive been reading over the FAQS on OSx86 and making some sense of this. It recommended following the specs of a mac pretty closely. My main use for the machine will be film work. So motion graphics, coloring etc.. Really I only need it so that I have FCP and a few other mac things at my disposal (FCP, Compressor, Color and some other randoms).
Anyone have any good hardware recommendations? Ideally I want a i7 at least running at 3ghz. Video card will have to be an nvidia one that runs well with the Mercury Play back engine in Premiere Pro.
Here is the list for Mercury enabled cards.
The two areas I basically need help with are the CPU and Motherboard/Audio. It be nice to have some firewire 800/400 ports as most drives I get from clients don't have eSata. Is this possible? Im a bit clueless on sound- I dont need crazy sound abilities- but it needs to work properly. For the CPU its pretty simple. I just want to make sure the i7 works well along with some speedy tri channel ram.

1373306151.0,1hvlcp,Been out of the game for a bit... Need help putting together a PC that can double as a Hackintosh!! [xpost from /r/buildapcforme],dpkonofa,7,1,6,"&gt;What will you be doing with this PC? Gaming? Photoshop? Web browsing? etc. If you need a Workstation

I'd like this to be a gaming machine with the ability to install the MacOS on it.  I absolutely *need* it to be able to play Bioshock Infinite on Max Settings with a bit of room to spare (I would like it to be able to run Infinite in an Oculus Rift) and I need the components to be workable for a Hackintosh setup so that I can run Xcode.  I also need to be able to run Unity well

&gt;What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

If possible, but am also open to the possibility that I might need to wait and save up more.  Ideally, though, I'd like to be sub-$1000.

&gt;When do you plan on building/buying the PC? (note: if you're planning on buying more than 2 weeks from now

Within the next week or 2

&gt;What, Operating System, peripherals like the keyboard, mouse, and monitor(s), wifi adapter, speakers/headphones

I don't need a monitor right now, or OS.  I have a few Windows Vista and Windows 7 licenses for these machines (we're buying these for some development team members so they have updated machines to work with).  I have at least 1 case from a few years back, so if cases haven't changed much, I can do without needing to buy one of them.  The case also has DVD-RW drive, SATA cables, and HDDs that can be re-used if needed.  WiFi is a must and I don't have a WiFi card handy.

&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US

US purchasing.  West Coast.  Can either be purchased in AZ or CA

&gt;If reusing any parts

Apple Cinema Display monitor that I'll be re-using (DVI) and possibly a power supply from Cooler Master (500W).

&gt;Will you be overclocking? If yes

Not opposed to over-clocking down the line, I just need the machine to run Bioshock Infinite at Max on an Oculus Rift with a minimum of futzing.

&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, etc.

No specifics except that it needs to be Hackintosh compatible so that we can boot into MacOS for Xcode.  USB3

&gt;Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs

Low noise is cool but not required.  I have a case

&gt;Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes

Yes.  I own a few unused licenses for Windows Vista

Thanks so much for your help guys!!  I appreciate it!!",,t5_2quen,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/1hvlcp/been_out_of_the_game_for_a_bit_need_help_putting/

What is the guesstimated lifespan of hackintoshes? Is it usually similar to the comparable iMac hardware going out of support cycles?

When updates do come out to OSX do you have to wait for tonyxmac to give the all clear before updating? Or can you proceed without much worry?

Prices are slightly lower at TigerDirect online (isn't reflected on PCPartPicker), and Case there for $35, $95, and $20 after rebate. Total, it brings the price down to Around $660 not including taxes or shipping.

I've been using a Mac all my life, and as daunting as it is, I feel like there's something (more than just a computer) to be gained from all of this (hopefully).

I've pretty much followed the CustoMac Pro build, get, consider, etc. In terms of purpose, I'd like to be able to play games and watch movies (presently, neither of which I can do smoothly/enjoyably). I see no need to accommodate any heavy video/editing work.

Also to add to this, the graphical interface freezes, if I have radio playing, it'll keep going (for hours) until I force it to turn off. Does that mean video card possibly? I'd imagine if it were the SSD, it'd stop completely...unless things are running from the ram...

Is there a way to run a diagnostic on it and post it here to see what is wrong? I ran diskutil, haven't redone driver packge installation since I haven't changed anything, and my plists are good to go. The spotlight was acting weird, so I turned off indexing - I know its not good for SSDs, but I use it a lot - that is why it was on. TRIM is enabled, other than that everything WAS working fine for months.

At first after reading I thought it might be the SSD (cause it seemed like bad ram/ssd behavior) so I flashed the SSD FW

1362808011.0,19yjj6,Mac-like 4 finger swipe in Windows 8 tutorial,TroyDL,13,5,5,"After a good deal of research and effort I have enabled 4 finger desktop swipe on my Samsung NP700Z7C-S03 laptop.  This allows me to swipe left or right and jump to a different workspace.  I figured this might be a good place to post this because I went down the hackintosh road too and there's a good chance some of you may be interested.

First off there are requirements.  I have only tested this with my pc so I can't guarantee it for other laptops or even other versions of windows on this laptop.  But I'm guessing as long as you have Windows 8 (maybe 7) and an Elan (elantech) touchpad with at least 4 finger multitouch

First requirement: an Elan touchpad with at least 4 finger swipe.  You can either check online to find out

Next requirement: Dexpot 1.6.6

Third requirement: Windows 8.  There is a very good chance 7 will work fine but this is the one I know works.  To be specific

Alright

1. Install Dexpot
2. Load registry editor and go to HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Elantech/SmartPad.  Make a backup of your registry settings just in case.  Make a backup of your whole OS if possible.  Do not change anything except what I specify.  Be aware that modifying your registry could make windows unusable so backup and be careful if you're new at that.  (Probably not a problem for this subreddit)
3. Open your Elantech specific touchpad settings UI and set it aside.
4. Open the Dexpot settings and go to controls on the left.
5. Change the following key settings to the following values if not there already:
FourFingerMove_Enable=0x00000001
FourFingerMove_Enable_Mode=0x00000000
FourFingerMoveLeft_Enable=0x00000001
FourFingerMoveLeft_Func=0x00000004
FourFingerMoveRight_Enable=0x00000001
FourFingerMoveRight_Func=0x00000003
6. Go to your mouse settings window you've opened and make a small change
7. Go back into Dexpot's settings/controls section and open the ""Switch desktop"" list.  Click on ""Next desktop"".  Check ""Allow hotkeys without modifiers"" and uncheck any modifiers.  Then click in the textbox underneath the modifiers.  Perform a 4 finger swipe left or right (depending on how you want it to function
8. Click apply and try it out.

If Keycode 167 or 166 did not show up then either your drivers or hardware doesn't support it

is my current build.

I have a single USB 3.0 header which is being used by my case's front IO panel. I want to buy the [NZXT Aperture M](http://www.nzxt.com/new/products/case_accessories/aperture_m) and have both the card reader and USB 3.0 ports working.

I've read that splitters are nonexistent due to the fact that a header is only able to run 2 ports at once. 

I believe it is possible to add one via a PCI card though,False,,t5_2quen,False,,,t3_16mt1r

Following [nofilmschool](http://nofilmschool.com/build-a-hackintosh/) as a guide

1. I went with the cheaper motherboard (instead of the Gigabyte Intel Z77) simply because I'm never going to use thunderbolt. Besides less SATA ports
2. I'm not about to start editing Red camera footage ever... but I'd like to do simple film stuff, but is there a glaring better option that I should be looking at? Not even sure if I would use the CUDA-accelerated stuff, but I might as well pick the card that includes that if it's a possibility, no?

Regarding the rendering that will take place on the computer I was planning on an i7 16gig ram no GPU machine because I assume rendering is something that can take advantage of multi-threading and doesn't need a GPU. Am I right in saying this or do I need CUDA cores?

I currently own a macbook pro, but between discovering the life hacker hackintosh guide and this subreddit, I have been rethinking this.  After doing a little research over the last couple of days, I thought that it might be cool to try my hand at this.  Now, I have NEVER built a computer in my life before, let alone a hackintosh, and to be completely honest

So firstly, but long run I don't want to be doing a LOT of tinkering (although some is fine).  Once you get a hackintosh to a working level, is there a lot of configuration that you have to do after the fact?  Or is this mostly in the setup?

Secondly

MOBO: Gigabyte GA-Z68XP-UD3
GPU: AMD Radeon HD 6870
Drives: 60GB OCZ Nocti Series SATA 3Gb/s
Memory: 16GB Corsair 1600Mhz DDR3
Power: Corsair 650watt
Optic Drive: Sony Optic

Lastly
Can anyone verify that this works?

Thank so much to anyone that can help or offer advice! I really need it...

I took a look at the FAQ and Tonymacx86's site

This particular hackintosh build is to replace our aging Mac Mini. It is for one user, and a billing program. The user is very insistent on this being a Mac, a Mini, and pretty looking. I might have to paint the case [white](http://i.imgur.com/VtgUO.gif).

* Open to suggestions for different parts.
* Is there anything else I am missing? I like the guides on Tonymac so I'll probably follow those.
* Are these hackintoshes particularly finicky once they are up are running? Do they need a lot of attention when Apple releases updates? The user is particularly skeptical of building a PC, at least. The user will also never let the builder down if this doesn't work.
* Replace ""user"" with ""wife"".",,t5_2quen,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/ra4oi/build_ready_hackintosh_mini/

1. Burn iBoot, DSDT, HDEF Update (found [here](http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=235523)), 10.6.7 and 10.7.1 combo updates (on Apple's official sites).

4. Boot disc
5. Format the drive to Journaled and name it (I called it Mac OS X).
6. Install
7. Boot the drive
8. Run the combo update 10.6.7
9. Run the DSDT Auto Patcher and SAVE the .aml file as ""GA P43T-ES3G"". Run the HDEF utility, you will have to create a new DSDT when Lion runs.
10. Leave the DSDT.aml on the desktop and let the combo update finish.
11. DO NOT RESTART. Run MultiBeast, ""ALC8xxHDA"", ""AppleHDA Rollback"", ""FakeSMC"", ""Chameleon RC5 Bootloader"", and ""GraphicsEnabler=No"". Run it, and restart.
12. Remove iBoot
13. Open and download Lion installer.
14. While Lion downloads
15. Run Lion Installer
16. Boot back to Snow Leopard
17. Restart, but nothing loads, except your mouse, GraphicsEnabler is set to yes, and you need to restart and run with that command).
18. Install successfully over you Mac OS X.
19. Boot into OS X

I'm new to this particular subreddit and have read through some of your posts. Thanks for the helpful information! 

I'm planning on following the tonymacx86 build found [here.](http://tonymacx86.blogspot.com/2010/08/building-customac-customac-pro-2010.html)

Here are some of the differences:

* Will be getting the i7 950 processors. I would like to overclock these a little bit.
* Would like to install more ram (about 12 gig)
* Will be getting a SSD drive
* Will be getting at least three 1TB drives (leaning to segagte) for a 1TB video RAID and a 1TB scratch disk. Perhaps a smaller and faster scratch disk?

I have a temporary ""wish list"" on NewEgg. I would appreciate your input. A few elements

A couple of key points for my build:

I would like to get a video card that takes advantage of the CUDA improvements with the Adobe CS5 suite [http://forums.adobe.com/thread/609054](http://forums.adobe.com/thread/609054)

I shoot and edit a lot of HD footage with the Canon 5D. I also encode to h.264 / DVD on a regular basis. Processing power is very important to me.

So please

*Edit: I forgot to mention that I'm a little confused about TRIM with the SSD. I have read that OS X does not support this

* UPDATE 1: Thankfully just as I got a deposit / contract for a large video project

i recently specced out and built one of tonymac's custom mac mini deluxe builds consisting of

1. GA-Z77N-wifi mobo with intel Core i7-3770 processor

2. 16 GB Corsair vengeance SDRAM

3. bit fenix prodigy case

4. Corsair **ENTHUSIAST** series 650 watt PSU

5. 1 TB Samsung Laptop SSHD (Hybrid drive)

6. **EVGA Geforce GTX 660 ti** (2GB)


I have had no problems installing Mountain Lion on this build and utilizing the onboard graphic card to tool around and work on the computer. in fact

the problem i've had is that my graphics card is NOT recognized at all after installing everything and then installing the graphics card (last step)

i've gone the ""GraphicsEnabler=No"" route.

i've actually installed the evga card on a windows box (just to make sure that it was working) and it worked no problem. i also tried installing a Quadro FX 4500 (out of a spare Mac pro) in the Hack and it at least showed an image on screen (if it wasn't a little unstable bc i just threw it in the nvidia build just to see if the PCI bus was working on the mobo.

i've seen other people on tonymac with almost identical builds install the 660 ti on the Z77N with no issues at all. card works fine for them.

i really don't know if any of you guys can help

one question i had was ""do i need to flash the bios of the 660 ti on a windows box before installing into the hack""?

but i don't have the most access to a winbox.

the last bit of info i can think to give is that i have tried installing with builds of 10.8.2 with the nvidia drivers installed from nvidia's site.

a 10.8.3 build with no drivers installed from nvidia (bc from what i understand

and also a 10.8.3 build WITH nvidia drivers installed....

all with no luck in recognizing the card. Mountain Lion installs fine though.

so at this point

so.... anyone have any thoughts? is there a ""p"" or a ""q"" that i'm not minding? is there a possibility that there is some other issue i am not thinking of?

sorry for the lengthy post

thanks in advance for any help you guys might be able to offer! if you need any questions answered for anything that may not be clear in my post

I'm new to Reddit and new to builds. I've done a bunch of research and decided to go with the No Film School build because a) I'll be video editing and b) his seemed well researched
What I've come to find out is: I was wrong. :)
There are many places where I thought things would be straightforward and they are decidedly not. He refers you to the instructions with different components that are either nonexistent or hard for a newbie to understand.
Anyway...
Does anyone have a step-by-step version of that build they've done? Or something very similar?
I had the preliminary components together per his instructions and was powering on to start tweaking BIOS... And nothing is happening.
I pulled the video card out and unhooked the bluray. Basically, cooler, 4 sticks of RAM and SSD. (I tried taking RAM out and putting them back in too.) All I get is a brief power up flash of LED and a tiny spin of the fans, then nothing.
Can anyone help?

* Possibly the ability to add another SSD in the future and dual boot Windows

My concerns:

* I don't know anything about motherboards. This one was on tonymacx86's guide
* CPU vs video card balance? From what I've read I don't *think* I'll have a bottlenecking issue with this build. Should I consider downgrading video card and/or upgrading processor?

So this is the second time I tried upgrading from my perfect lion partition, which is a fresh ""upgrade"" install btw...


I've looked around and I can't seem to find a solution to my issue. I've found a few posts on google with some people describing this issue but no one seems to know how to fix it or chime in and help.


Basicly on my mountain lion drive while on the Internet or working on music in logic the GUI would freeze completely and often times a loading beach ball icon would show on the cursor. I can still move the cursor around however the time display stops at the time the GUI freezes. I could be sitting there for 5 or ten minutes the mouse still moves but the GUI still frozen. I can't so anything but but do hit the restart button on my case to force a restart.


I want to mention after installing 10.8.4 
I wen ahead and updated my video drivers from the nvidia site that supports 10.8.4 along with the cuda drivers separately inside the system pref.


I have a feeling it might be a graphic card issue but I'm told my graphics card works out of the box



here is my setup

Motherboard: MSI Z77A-GD65 Z77 

Processor: Intel Core i7-2700K Quad-Core Processor 3.5  - (over clocked to 4.2 ghz)

This build is still a long way off

*I have a PowerMac G5 I will be using as the case (any space issues?)
*I know i could go i5 and save about $100.  I probably won't use all the power of i7
*Motherboard (no idea if this is a good one)
*Memory - 2x8 or 4x4.  Any benefits either way? 
*Video Card - Thinking of going big now on the 670 and pick up another in a year or two to SLI it
*Monitor is a huge variable depending on the space the computer will live.
*Dual SSD for easier dual booting.

1. Does this build look compatible? Does 2 SSD work in the case with the motherboard. From what I researched

2. I would like to have constant internet access. What would be the most cost-effective way to do this?

3. How would you suggest I assemble the case, and the monitor together? The monitor has a base which will most-likely not work very well and the gps has a magnet on its base to attach to things.  
I'm looking to be able to carry it around in a backpack. Cooling might be an issue if that becomes the case. I'd be happy to mod a backpack but would be happier to hear your tips as well.

EDIT: 4. Pc Part picker says that the computer would take 104w which is within the 250w of the case's power supply. However

I have found two separate ways to get the 7950 to boot but don't know where to start with either.

[this post](http://www.tonymacx86.com/318-amd-radeon-hd-7xxx-graphics-support-os-x-10-8-3.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+tonymacx86rss+(tonymacx86)) says that: 

&gt;The AMD Radeon HD 7xxx must be the secondary graphics device in your system in order to boot using Chimera/Chameleon without a boot error and gibberish text. This is because of the larger video BIOS size. You can work around this by having a second AMD PCIe card in your system

Would I still be able to use my 7950 in Windows if I installed an older 5770 into my computer to run Mac? Or would I have to physically unplug the second video card before trying to boot into Windows?

I also saw [this](http://www.osx86.net/view/3572-xfx_7950_10.8.3_12d68_full_qe_+_hd_300_...html) and was wondering if that would make it so I didn't have to have a second video card

I recently installed OSX Mountain Lion on my desktop via Unibeast. Almost everything worked flawlessly out of the box - only required a Realtek audio kext beyond the standard FakeSMC patches and whatnot.

HDMI audio still remains non-functioning though. I spent close to a week sifting through dozens of forums and trying my hand at applying HD3000 AMI EFI patch to my dsdt.asl with no success. Every attempt resulted in a kernel panic. After several failures

Would greatly appreciate any advice you guys can offer. I'd be happy to upload my IOReg and/or dsdt.aml to some file hosting site and post the link here as well when I get home if anybody experienced wants to take a look at it.

- OS X Mountain Lion 10.8.2
- Core i7 2600K 3.5GHz
- ASRock P67 Extreme4 Gen3 (Intel 6 series chipset)
- Gigabyte nVidia GTX680 2GB (w/ latest nVidia Mac drivers - fully enabled QE/CI)

- OCZ Vertex4 258GB SSD (OS X)

1) Sound
2) Graphics
3) Booting directly into Mountain Lion as fast as possible (skip chameleon

How should I set up multi beast?

1357062084.0,15s0b2,Protip:  Don't have more than one EFI partition in your Hackintosh if you expect to be able to boot Windows.  ,belthesar,8,3,2,"A little while back

I started out my build with a slightly modified TonyMacX86 build, is a great idea.  The first install went just peachly with me using separate 74 GB Raptors to boot off of, as that's what I had laying around in my office.  I then, however, got a laptop with an SSD at work, and the performance increase was do dramatic that I had to get one for my home rig.  One far too easy Amazon Prime purchase, and I was the proud owner of a Mushkin Chronos Deluxe 256 GB. 

Because I couldn't handle having just one OS on my dual boot system having super fast drive access, formatting and installing Windows on the SSD with all of the creative partitioning required to make that happen, I then proceed to pull out my trusty external boot drive and get ready to Carbon Copy Cloner over my old OS partition - that is, until I KP because I have a DSDT when running on UEFI.

Unfortunately, thanks to someone at this subreddit,  I would be introduced to the Chameleon/Chimera flag ""DSDT=No"" which allowed me to resurrect my OS X partition and boot drive.  Hooray!  I slap the old Raptor back into the computer and go to town CCC'ing the disk to the SSD. After doing so, making sure not to clone the DSDT file, I was back in business in my OS X partition.  I choose not to boot into Windows again for a while because, dammit, I got my OS X partition back!  

Until yesterday.  The girlfriend and I decide to buy The Secret World.  I could have tried to make it run under WINE, I say.  So I try chkdisking my Windows and EFI partition. Negative.  Try rebuilding the Windows BCD? Nope.  Windows reports that it found multiple devices that could be associated with the boot loader, and couldn't fix itself.  This should have been a red flag, but I'd never encountered anything like this before, so it didn't click.  Eventually, I say screw it, and torch my Windows install and associated partitions.  I get ready to reinstall

So I shut down the machine, the UEFI system on the motherboard chose it vs. the SSD's EFI partition.  I never needed to reinstall Windows - just pull out the old drive with the EFI partition.  

TL;DR - [If you try to boot Windows with more than one EFI partition,False,,t5_2quen,False,,,t3_15s0b2

This is the build I'm planning on ordering within the next few days.  I currently own a MacBook (Late 2008 Aluminum Unibody) and was looking to upgrade to play games and such.  Originally I was just going to build a regular old Windows PC

I had a couple of kind of stupid questions about compatibility. I did a quick google but didn't find anything relevant.

1.  Does it matter what RAM you use for a Hackintosh?  I wanted to use this RAM shown above but I wasn't sure if the RAM suggested on tonymacx86 was there for a reason.

2.  Does it matter if I use this 670?  This may be a stupid question but none of the suggested 670s on tonymacx86 were 4GB versions so I was wondering if there was a known issue.  I could easily just get the 2GB if it was a problem.

Hey guys

I'm running into a problem where, I am able to boot into the bios.

Is it a problem with my config? I have both 8-pin power cables (from the EVGA box)going into the back. I have tried using one of my PSU's PCI-E powercords with no luck as well.

I haven't built a computer in many years so it could be a stupid thing I'm overlooking. 

Any help? Thanks!

1. No audio. No output device found. I installed the .kext but didn't do any HDEF edits (I don't even know what that means)
2. RAM is reading as 1333 MHz.
3. Boot screen is low-res. A minor beef
4. Hard drives (both of them) appear as External.
5. Wi-Fi seems oddly flakey. It forgets my network when waking from sleep (but sleep works!) and seems slow or nonfunctional on select web pages
6. Odd ghosting of text. For example
7. When I boot the system, and then after a few seconds my desktop is there and ready. There's no fade-in type transition.

I was a little weary about my webcam. It actually wasn't a problem at all when I finally plugged it in it worked out of the box. My webcam is [Microsoft Lifecam Cinema](http://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-LifeCam-Cinema-720p-Webcam/dp/B002MCZJ78). I also have a [D-Link DBT-120](http://www.amazon.com/D-Link-DBT-120-Wireless-Bluetooth-Adapter/dp/B00006B7DB/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1334119023&amp;sr=1-1) BT adapter that also worked out of the box. 

Not a bad experience second time around for my hackintosh (first one was an acer laptop). 

I'd like to give a shutout to Miles from the tonymac site for helping me out throughout this process!

The first method I tried was iboot+multibeast. I followed the directions, and once I got through the install, I got them after running osx for a few minutes everytime I started up. And then I would get a kernel panic during the reboot. I should have kept better track of my crash pages, but I didn't. 

Then I tried the iAtkos method- I made a boot DVD, but with a tiny ""no"" icon over the apple.

I also tried [this method](http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=256729), then rebooted back into windows.

* Some of the ports on the motherboard don't work. 2 of the usb ports give power for a second to my mouse and keyboard, and Displayport all don't function when in the operating system. The DVI and VGA work fine when booting up and to the loading apple screen, then nothing.

Pretty much all builds make use of Gigabyte mainboards (why does everybody love them?). Gigabyte does not support UEFI. I want UEFI because the upcoming Windows 8 will make use of UEFI to shorten the pre-boot time

Now all other mainboards I found have some kind of sleep problem (not waking up and the like).

I'm running Windows 7 and Lion 10.7.1, respectively. Windows is for gaming – Lion for work and everything else. I use two benq XL2410T displays, which work perfect in both operating systems. Coming from a 2010 27"" iMac, I'm totally in love with this setup. It's so fast and elegant.

* Gainward GeForce GTX 580 Phantom 3GB GDDR5 RAM

I haven't built this system yet

I spent the weekend getting OS X Lion running on my older HP Pavilion m9200t (E8400 Core2Duo processor and 512MB 8800GT). I figured it would be a good practice run to fail miserably on

I first installed Snow Leopard with iBoot and a retail 10.6.0 disc and ran the 10.6.7 combo update. I then upgraded to 10.7 and used MultiBeast / Easybeast. After that I upgraded to Lion in the App Store. I had to use MultiBeast again to get my sound and ethernet working.

I ran Cinebench on my 8800GT before and after the Snow Leopard to Lion update... went from 22fps to 29fps in the OpenGL test! Not bad for an old card... I can run WoW in Ultra settings and a Wine port of Guild Wars at max settings.

I'm also upgrading my CS4 suite to CS5.5 to coincide with this system upgrade. Planning to switch from FCP to Premiere and make use of the CUDA drivers... Should be interesting... The Mercury Playback Engine looks awesome!

Anyway, and upgrades video card to a 560 ti... comes out to around $850. Ridiculously cheap compared to a ""real"" Mac Pro!",,False,,t5_2quen,True,,

So, but I haven't found much when it comes to compatibility with the UD4 model. I know I don't have a SSD to maximize the full potential of the Z68, but the price difference is negligible and it helps to future-proof a bit.

Also

Just curious if anybody can give me the straight dope on the Overclocked Edition, I can't tell the difference except that the overclocked version seems to be a bit quicker. Everything I've read about the Asus 660 Ti is that it works great out of the box and has strong, quiet performance.

The only few questions I have left are:

1. Is there a big difference in which GPU I choose (brand wise)?

2. Is it worth getting the 670 over the 660 TI? (still quite a price jump)

3. Do I need a CPU cooler?

4. Am I making a huge mistake?

Because of the gigabytes of photos in iPhoto and my parents that are used to Mac OS X my first guess was the Apple website

That was when my interest in a hackintosh started. I know how to build my own PC (I'm already using a Windows 7/8 desktop and an VMWware ESXi server).

My main question is how hard (or how easy) it is to actually setup and to keep it working. Can I just get the hardware from the 'Basic Compatibility Guide' and a Mac OS X 10.8 DVD and it will directly work? Also will all features be supported and can I still dual boot it with windows (8)?

Thank you for your time

The specs I was thinking about for them was  
- intel ivy bride or haswell i5  
- 400+ GB SSD  
- integrated graphics (they never play games on it)

The build looks good and I'm ready for my critique. My only concerns at this point are the Motherboard and Audio card; I keep coming up light on PCI slots so I went with a lower end board. It has a great rep for Hackintoshing but I'm not unwilling to upgrade it.

As for audio I'm completely open to suggestions; this box will be doubling as a game machine so the best sound would be preferable.

Thanks!

I also noticed everyone who is dual booting like I am is using an SSD for the OS and a regular hard drive for storage? Is this something I forgot to purchase?

So this weekend I've finally decided to give this thing a go. I've had my computer for about 5 months now

Now I've been lurking for a long time on here

* We can now get the 7XXX series AMD cards to work

* There are some sound issues with my motherboard

* I may run into issues booting without my AMD card for the first time, smaller monitor for setup.

Now with that being said, I've read all over TonyMacX86 and this sub-reddit, but I can't seem to grasp what exactly I have to do!

I was getting the Boot0 gibberish error for days until I finally figured out that I needed to switch my bios to IGD instead of PEG to initially run chimera.

So I can turn on my computer and the screen goes black until OSX boots and bam

The problem is is that normally i use a SSD for my windows install.  Problem 1

problem 2 is that I can't see my BIOS anymore... or anything for that matter. How do I get around this? I'm assuming I can plug the HDMI directly into my mobo instead of my graphics card.

Just got a Radeon 7770. Awesome card
1) Booting with IGFX forced and Internal Graphics disabled (including the sleep ""trick"") - didn't work.
2) Installing clover to a USB drive and booting from that with the same prompts above. Also no dice. I can boot into Mac fine with IGFX and Internal force-enabled, unfamiliar with Clover and it's UI is very poorly designed. 

Any advice would be great! Thanks!

Okay so I'm having problems with dual booting into Windows 8. I'm very new to all of this so I'll do my best at explaining my problem. 

The OSX install went smoothly

 ""*Windows cannot be installed to this disk. The selected disk has an MBR partition table. On EFI systems

So I unplugged every other drive and just left the 1TB drive I wanted to install Windows on
Now when I plug all the other drives back in and I try to boot into windows with the bootloader

Any solutions?",,t5_2quen,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/1bsipu/problems_with_dual_booting/
