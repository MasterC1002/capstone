But before diving in, since the primary audience is the prototypical MFA user (20s, student/young professional, no/part-time job, according to the 2012 community survey).  Second, there’s an American bias, both in terms of style and stores/brands.  According to the same community survey, so the community is naturally going to lean that direction.  If there’s a Canadian, or any other international user who wants to post country-specific advice or brand recommendations in the comments

**I.  Basic Principles**

----
My general recommendations for building a basic

 * ***Fit, but the quickest rules of thumb are that shoulder seams should sit at the top of your natural shoulder instead of drooping down your arms, pants should stay up without a belt, and clothes should follow the lines of your body without being excessively tight or baggy.  Those are true whether you’re thin or heavy, tall or short, a bodybuilder or a marathon runner – the basic rules of fit don’t change.  

 * ***Versatility is Key.*** Don't buy individual *outfits* - look for versatile clothes that can be mixed and matched.   A few pairs of pants and a handful of shirts can be combined and recombined into a massive number of outfits.  In fact

 * ***There's No Shame in Simplicity.***  You see a lot of complaints on MFA (and probably in this very thread) about how the community doesn't encourage people to develop their personal style or unique flair, expanding and refining your taste.  See [this comment]( http://tinyurl.com/8tetkoh) from u/AlGoreVidalSassoon about laying down a foundation, and  [this excellent comment]( http://tinyurl.com/8h47g8h) from u/TheHeartofTuxes about crafting a unique, expressive personal style.  

----

**II.  Building a Basic Wardrobe**

----

Don’t read this as a list of requirements to be well-dressed – rather, classic basics that are hard to go wrong with and easy to wear across different ages and body types.  If you're beyond these basics and need more tailored advice or advanced guidance, check out the guides linked within or post the question to MFA.  

In general, J.Crew, Lands’ End (including the Canvas line, which is aimed at a younger audience), JCPenney (in particular, their Levi’s sections and the new JCP line), H&amp;M

Unless you live somewhere without seasonal weather variation

**A.  Spring/Summer Basics**  (see [the spring/summer guide from the sidebar]( http://redd.it/oqc1c) for a more detailed discussion)

 * Shirts - For casual outfits, [Uniqlo](http://bit.ly/XxdpRW)).  For casual through business casual, staples include long-sleeve oxford-cloth button-downs (ocbds) in white or blue ([JCP](http://jcp.is/XQ3uDD), [Lands’ End]( http://tinyurl.com/8d5sp6o))  and long-sleeve shirts in classic summer patterns like [madras]( http://i.imgur.com/9nMcr.jpg) and [gingham]( http://i.imgur.com/JbMRG.jpg).  [Roll up the sleeves]( http://redd.it/zvrrc)  to wear them more casually, keep them rolled down for business casual.  For a basic wardrobe, I recommend avoiding black shirts (even tees) and short-sleeve button-up shirts.  [See the guide to shirts on the sidebar for more info.]( http://redd.it/vor0m)  

 * Pants – For the spring and summer, depending on body type]( http://tinyurl.com/8reth95)), and flat-front slim-fitting chinos in tan/khaki, olive green or navy ([Dockers D1 or Alphas]( http://tinyurl.com/9acx5gp), [Lands’ End Canvas]( http://tinyurl.com/9eeys38), [Gap]( http://tinyurl.com/onm4k)).  Depending on where you live and how you feel about them, shorts are useful too.  For shorts, solid-colored chino shorts without cargo pockets that hit somewhere between at your knee to 2” above.  [Here's a visual guide.](http://redd.it/1968m0)

 * Jacket - Depending on where you live

 * Sportcoat/blazer - For business casual, or tan cotton jacket are indispensible.  

 * Shoes – The shoe guide has much more on this,[ Vans]( http://www.zappos.com/vans-authentic-core-classics-navy)) or some version of moccasins ([LL Bean blucher mocs]( http://tinyurl.com/8bcwmea) ,[Sperry Top-siders]( http://www.zappos.com/sperry-top-sider-authentic-original-sahara)).  These can be worn with jeans, chinos or shorts, so they’re very versatile.  Chukka boots with rubber or crepe soles are another common spring/summer recommendation ([Clarks](http://tinyurl.com/av3metw)).  All of them can be worn sockless or with [no-show loafer socks.](http://tinyurl.com/9lh2vaj)  When you get closer to the business casual end of the spectrum, a pair of brown captoes or wingtips are workhorses ([Allen Edmonds](http://tinyurl.com/chmvaeu), [Stafford](http://tinyurl.com/afxgluh)).

 * Accessories – Other things you may want to invest in are sunglasses (Wayfarers, or knockoffs from mall kiosks), a watch ([Timex Weekender](http://tgt.biz/Zg32wj), [Seiko 5]( http://tinyurl.com/9pbsc6z)), ties ([2.5” knit, solid silk, and subtle stripes]( http://www.thetiebar.com/)) and caps ([simple baseball caps](http://bit.ly/fCJzWE)) are all worth looking at and investing in.

**B.  Fall/Winter Basics** (again

 * Shirts/Sweaters -  Look for some [heavier-weight fall/winter shirts]( http://redd.it/10rkh0), thinner v-neck merino wool sweaters ([Target]( http://tinyurl.com/9cqnjc8), [J.Crew]( http://tinyurl.com/9xekv9q), [Uniqlo](http://bit.ly/UYwtQT)), and cardigans ([Uniqlo](http://bit.ly/16EOTgi), [Target]( http://tinyurl.com/93kdzht)) are all basics worth considering.  

 * Pants – You can obviously keep wearing the jeans and chinos from the spring/summer section, brown, merlot), wool pants, or cords.  [See the pants guide on the sidebar for more.](http://redd.it/ttoyw)

 * Shoes/Boots – The boot guide on the sidebar is very thorough, [Red Wing]( http://tinyurl.com/8e36lk5)) and some rain/snow boots ([LL Bean]( http://redd.it/11srff), [Sorel]( http://tinyurl.com/926gfch)) (depending on your local weather, of course).

 * Outerwear – What you need obviously depends on region, a hooded parka is virtually a necessity ([LL Bean]( http://tinyurl.com/94opgs3), [Lands’ End]( http://tinyurl.com/9uvvbl8)).   You can buy cheap versions of these coats at places like Target, but if warmth is your goal, outerwear is something worth investing in.

From Sunday May 5th through Sunday May 19th, store websites, etc) in the title of your posts, although you can certainly still include them in the body of a text post.  We're hoping you'll supplement that link with [more detail and context,](http://redd.it/l9xst) and that it will generate better discussion *and better advice for you* than a simple ""Whaddya think"" imgur link.  

For example, many would say it has increased their quality.  At the same time, however, it has also changed how many MFA subscribers are exposed to these albums.  [Searching for inspiration album and sorting by new](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/search?q=inspiration+album&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on) shows that most new inspiration album posts are getting 100-200 upvotes consistently.  Before the guidelines for inspiration albums changed, the spread was much greater - many got no traction at all while others hit the top of the sub (and /r/all) with 500-2000+ votes.  The trade-off, in other words, has been context for exposure.  

Now we're going to give it a trial period for all of /r/malefashionadvice.

Some of you will love the change, /u/schiaparelli (a moderator for /r/femalefashionadvice and all-around cool cat) eloquently responded with her thoughts and FFA's experience [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1cv80g/why_im_hesitant_to_go_selfpost_only/c9kfvcz) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1cv80g/why_im_hesitant_to_go_selfpost_only/c9ky1wr). 

What we ask is that everyone - whether you've lobbied for the change, or have never thought about it before - *keeps an open mind*.  Regular users, lurkers, brand-new subscribers alike - we hope you'll give a little bit of thought to the character of MFA over the next couple weeks, and participate in the wrap-up/assessment post on Sunday the 19th.  How did it change the community?  *Did* it at all?  For the better?  For the worse?  How so?  If you're new, try to put yourself in the shoes of a long-time regular.  If you're a regular contributor, try to put yourself in the shoes of a brand-new subscriber.

What can I say?  I like baggy clothes.  They're telling me that the shirts are way too large and the jeans are too baggy...And I need a new haricut.  Also no more tennis shoes.

Is there anything else not so great with the outfits?  Now for the fun part

I'm about 5'11"" 140-145 lbs.  My shoulders and arms aren't too large which makes fitting shirts really difficult.  I did take a look at the [fit guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/ehrtv/shujins_comprehensive_fit_guide/) but I feel like I'm not built all that normal.

**EDIT:**

**Thank you all!**

**My sister is going shopping with me this weekend.  I think I'm going to start with Target and get a few S/XS mossimo/merona shirts to wear around so I'll get used to the smaller size.  Then we'll hit up JCrew once I'm comfortable with the size.  For jeans everyone mentioned Levi's sizes either 514/513 or 511/510.  As for shoes I'm going to think about boots or boat shoes.  Not sure what I want just yet.**

**On the haircut front I'm gonna go short with it like I used to do when I had hair.  If it turns out to be a poor choice I'll buzz it all off.  I constantly shave every other day so I'll play around with looks that include/exclude facial hair.  I personally like the facial hair but we'll see.**

This guide was the first thing I read when I came to this subreddit and I learned so much from it. A big thank you to Nick who despite being very busy gave generously with his time and rewrote large parts of his original post for me. We've been working on it in our spare time since May. Hopefully as a result more people will read and learn from the guide.  If people enjoy this and there's a demand I might start to do this with other sidebar guides.

Stop.

Breathe.

This is what you should do.

----

**First: Four simple rules.**

----

**1.  Read the sidebar.**  - No, you’re clearly making some kind of effort to look better.  Take some more time to look through it.  Read it right now.  Not all at once, not all with equal attention, and don’t expect to absorb everything your first time through.  Read it multiple times, and take it in one bit at a time. 

Start with the “Getting Started Section”

**2.  Figure out your personal situation.** - Who are you and what are you dressing for?  Are you looking to update your work wardrobe?  Are you a student in college looking for a more “mature” look?   Do you live in Canada or are you moving to Texas?  Dressing well doesn’t exist in a vacuum

In a similar vein, you don’t need to buy more immediately, even if they don’t fit well.

**3. Buy well-fitting, Versatility, and Simplicity. These are the most important things to consider when you’re starting fresh.

* FIT:  There’s a reason the “[How Clothes Should Fit](http://redd.it/ehrtv)” guide is the first guide in the sidebar.  Fit is the most important factor to consider when buying clothes. Case in point: [Daniel Craig in 2002](http://i.imgur.com/cf5NGXD.jpg) vs [Daniel Craig in 2012](http://i.imgur.com/bQOk0cB.jpg). Cheap clothes that fit well are always going to look better than expensive clothes that don’t.
* VERSATILITY:  Buy neutral-colored clothes that can be easily mixed and matched with each other.  Don’t try to buy 3 “outfits”.  Instead, 3 shirts and 3 pairs of pants, and you’ll have 9 outfits that look good.  Check out the [Color Guide](http://redd.it/15tjgv) and ""[Building Outfits that Work](http://redd.it/19qc8c)"" for more on this.
* SIMPLICITY:  This usually goes hand-in-hand with versatility.  If you put a bunch of versatile items together

These three concepts: fit, work together to create the idea of “basics”.  For a beginner, this is the easiest and best way to start a new wardrobe.  Once you’ve filled in the gaps of things you need with well-fitting, versatile basics, you’ve created a strong foundation for your wardrobe.  From there, you can build on it in any way you’d like.  

**4. Don’t spend all of your money at once.**
Seriously.  Take all of the money you’re ready to spend and put it in the bank.  Blowing all of your money on clothes at once is a bad idea

* It’s too easy to go overboard on buying “basics”.  For a beginner, and more than 3 of any type of item is excessive.  You’ll end up wasting money on things you don’t need, and then you’ll miss a great deal on something you love.
* **Don't buy something just because it's cheap**.  Sales are your friend
* Even if you’ve read the sidebar guides 10 times each, and it is even harder to apply to yourself.  It can only develop with experience.
* Your tastes will change a lot in 6 months.  Take a note from the guide to “[Developing Personal Style](http://redd.it/17mn5x)”

Trust me: buying everything at once will lead to a pile of mediocre clothes, start with buying slowly and buying cheaply.  **Think hard about your purchases before making them.**

----

**Our Plan of Attack:**


----

**Step one: Figure out your context.**  

Remember rule #2?  Make a list of things you have and a list of things you need.  To make these lists

**Step two: Try on as many new things as you can

If it’s on your list, or take a pic and post it to the Official Feedback and Fit Check thread.  Remember: there is no definitive list of men’s wardrobe essentials; there are only suggestions.  What you need to do is decide if and how an item works for you.  If it doesn’t, take it off your list.

**Step three: Prioritize the purchases you will make.**  

What do you need immediately? What do you already have enough of?  Your absolute priorities (ie. suits or dress code items) should be your first purchases

Think of buying an item as paying to unlock more outfits.  Would you rather pay $30 for a shirt to create 2 new outfits, tops/bottoms, and accessories.

**Step four: Start shopping with purpose.**  

Don’t shop without knowing exactly what you are looking for.  Shop around, and **quality**.  Keep looking until you’ve found something that’s right for you.

**Step five: Don’t buy it just yet.**  

Put your potential purchase out of your mind for a week.  Then come back and look at it with fresh eyes.  Is it still a good idea?  If the answer is yes

**Step six: Repeat.** 

Repeat until you’ve built a collection of well-fitting and versatile basics for your wardrobe.  By now

Now what?  For some, you want to expand beyond the basic wardrobe.

**Step Seven:  Develop your personal style.**  

From here

----

**So... I’ve Got $X.  What should I buy?**

THE LONG-AWAITED ANSWER:  What you should buy depends on your personal situation, did you not read any of the words above this?  

**No

If you want a list of things to buy, make sure they fit, and see if they work for you.  Remember, don’t spend it all at once.

**But I don’t like the Basic Wardrobe:**

Check out what the [FAQ has to say](http://redd.it/149k8f).

**When shouldn't I buy something?**

Check out [this post](http://www.styleforum.net/t/303455/the-contentedness-thread/40_40#post_5546275) on styleforum and the comments that follow for a list of reasons you shouldn't buy something.  Check out the rest of the thread

So I kind of lied.  I wasn't trying to literally answer the question, of course, is to read the sidebar and lurk on MFA.  But at the moment, the current sidebar is overwhelming.  So I wrote out a guide to getting started on a new wardrobe.

So I had an idea after seeing [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/z6ppe/tried_my_hand_at_some_vavltstyle_collages_this_is/) post of making a set of images that could visually transmit the information in the guides. Fashion is a very visual thing and although the text will always be better for explaining why some things are better than others I have always been a fan of the whole ""show don't tell"" thing.

I would like to do this with shirts, jeans, chinos, and even entire outfits. However for now I will be testing out ideas with shoes, more specifically canvas sneakers.

My idea for the canvas sneakers would be to have two main groups of images:
The first would take examples of shoes of different brands and styles that MFA finds good and organize them in the 4 main colors recommended by the [shoe guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/p7usf/shoe_guide_v20/), organized, and with style comments on the side.

So I would love to hear what MFA thinks of this idea

Edit 1: Ok I just got back and from the number of upvotes it sounds like people want this. I will start reading through comments now.

Edit 2: Alright

Update: [Here](http://i.imgur.com/uLjAL.jpg) is the yet untagged and organized prototype of the Basic Brands &amp; Prices picture. I am having troubles finding a large enough Spring Court image

**Update 2: I would first like again thank everyone's enthusiasm. Then take some time to point out that some people are already assuming I am a fashion expert, ShezUK, and Aspid92) should be working on. Furthermore the idea has been put out there that this would be much more helpful if we had models with different body types, to which I say no one is stopping people on MFA from modeling the guide we will eventually put together. So starting today I will be working on the shoes, pants, and t-shirts guides. After that I will most likely make another post on MFA (as this one is getting very long, but idk,,1346704035.0,t3_z8jbk

But most of the advice catered here is focused on *what pieces you should buy* and not on *how these pieces interact*. We have great guides on creating **wardrobes**

Of course

Now, as well as avoiding common pitfalls for beginners. I'm sure it's not complete though. There is much more to that than I could possibly explain. I would appreciate very very much if someone more knowledgeable (or more skilled with the english language) than me wants to complement my text in the comments.

**The basic principles of design**

&gt;*To achieve visual unity is a main goal of graphic design. When all elements are in agreement

-Alex White

I stumbled upon [this link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_elements_and_principles#Principles_of_design) a while ago here in MFA. This small list of principles of design helped me understand better what makes an outfit work or not.

The first of them is **unity** (aka cohesion or synergy). Lack of it is one of the main reasons some outfits in the WAYWT or OFFC threads don't work. If your shoes say something and your jacket says something else, not as a sum individual parts.* This is probably the most important ""lesson"" in this guide, and I will return to it before the text is over. This applies to many elements in the outfit: fit, colour, level of formality, style, etc.

That is not to say that there can't be a **hierarchy** between different pieces from an outfit. It's ok to have one of the pieces as the focal point, the eye is drawn first to the camo shorts, because of the busy pattern, then to the shoes, because of the bright colour, and lastly to the muted t-shirt. So there is a hierarchy here in which the shorts are the ""strongest"" element and the tshirt is the ""weakest"" one. What I mean here as a ""strong"" element is something that draws attention to itself, either because it has a heavy [pattern](http://i.imgur.com/rWZB0jj.jpg), or because the [fit](http://i.imgur.com/CGUYRj6.jpg) is different

When putting together an outfit with items that have different ""strengths"", left, right) usually won't look good as distributing them along the outfit. Take [this fit](http://i.imgur.com/UcK1IvN.jpg) (thanks, only56), for example. The tie and the shoes are the *strong* elements, while the shirt and pants are relatively muted. It would look a lot worse if he had gone with strong tie and shirt and muted shoes and pants, because the strong elements would clash and the outfit would look unbalanced. When an element is just [TOO strong](http://i.imgur.com/rWZB0jj.jpg) it's usually advised to keep the rest of the outfit relatively muted.

---

**The importance of context and creating an image**

&gt;*Actors seek to fulfill the obligations encapsulated in a role, and the ethos, practices and expectations of its institutions. Embedded in a social collectivity, they do what they see as appropriate for themselves in a specific type of situation.*

-James G. March and Johan P. Olsen

[This recent thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/19muqz/mfa_whats_the_reason_you_started_dressing_better/) teaches us something that is actually pretty obvious: for most people fashion isn't interesting just because of the clothes, fashion is empowering. (there's been [another recent thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/19fhf8/discussion_how_does_fashion_integrate_into_your/) by milky_funk that has something to do with this)

So when you ask yourself what clothes you want to wear

Context here means many things: where (in the world, how old you are, what you do, what's the occasion, etc. Fashion varies wildly across the globe, and what is expected from a 16 year old high-schooler is different from what is expected from a 50 year-old businessman. Keep that in mind: who you are and where you live also play a role in the image I mentioned in the previous paragraph.  

This is why sometimes getting fashion advice and inspiration from the internet may feel disconnected from the reality. Fashion blogs will tell you that every man *needs* a navy blazer

My preferred approach is different ([/fa/'s website preaches a similar idea](http://thefaggotstore.org/)). Pay attention to the ones around you. What do people in your environment wear? Ask yourself how you want to look in contrast to them. Do you want to fit in and look attractive? Do you want to look rebellious and make people uncomfortable? Do you want to look professional and respectable? Do you want to look older? Younger? These are all valid desires and they should guide how you approach fashion. The choice of how you want to look should be a conscious one

---

**Applying all that: fit, style, etc.**

&gt;*This question goes far beyond what you wear. It points to how you engage with life and how life unfolds through you. This is a question of perceiving something that is already happening

-TheHeartOfTuxes

I want here demonstrate how the principles (particularly cohesion) mentioned so far can be applied to different outfit elements.

* First of all, however try to achieve a certain unity and balance through the outfit. A looser fit all around [can](http://i.imgur.com/vmY6oh.jpg) look [good](http://i.imgur.com/rP9c0URh.jpg) (thanks huhwot and lobstertainment), as [does](http://i.imgur.com/ygKbI.jpg) a full blown [skinny](http://i.imgur.com/zbWpK.jpg) (thanks LeTigreLeTigre and sweetjesusonfire). Another way to achieve balance is to [contrast](http://i.imgur.com/dRbpI.jpg) a [""heavier"" top block](http://i.imgur.com/iUWgJ.jpg) with a [skinnier bottom](http://i.imgur.com/FD5eJ.jpg) (thanks Pokesteve and freench). *I know this section is terribly incomplete, if somebody wants to expand this subject, please do so. For now, I'll just leave a link here to the [wonderful guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/15sej6/guide_understanding_fit_and_proportion_in_an/) on fit and proportions by Schiaparelli for FFA. Hey, now schoonerism [did one](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1i11f1/style_guide_silhouette/) for us in MFA too!*

* **Colour** is next. Colour is hard to explain, white and brown is perhaps the most classic and the easiest scheme to work with in male fashion and usually loooks great on both [casual](http://i.imgur.com/ubMA8R8.jpg) and [formal](http://i.imgur.com/RXO1W.jpg) outfits (thanks desmigalhation and skinniouschinnious). Monochromatic schemes are harder to [make work](http://cdn.dressed.so/i/511deb55bf8c4l.jpg), but can look [very awesome](http://i.imgur.com/O8Pyz.jpg) (thanks Azurewrath and milky_funk!). For more info on colour, these guides are useful: [the seasonal approach](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/15tjgv/livemethods_heroically_enormous_seasonal_color/), [the biomimicry theory](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1280n1/the_biomimicry_color_theory_an_view_on_why_some/) and [FFA's guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/xeyqk/lessons_on_color_theory_and_how_to_apply_it_to/).

* Common mistake when starting to dress: **formality** clash. Many clueless newcomers, isolated formal piece on top of it. Usually a fedora, a waistcoat, a tie or a suit jacket. It usually ends up looking [terrible](http://i.imm.io/Xvbo.jpeg). See how the jacket says ""formal"" while the other pieces say ""casual"", ruining any hope of unity this outfit might have achieved otherwise? ^((disclaimer: this was posted with the consent of the subject in the picture)^)

* It's usually advisable to have some **style** unity in an outfit as well. What I mean here is that an outfit should say one single message instead of mixing different messages together. If you look rugged from head to toe, dress shoes and a military field jacket, the concept is lost and the outfit is confusing.

* The [fedora](http://youshouldntwearthatfedora.tumblr.com/) is a great example of something that tends to not look good. But is it *possible* to work a fedora into an outfit? I put together [a few pics](http://imgur.com/a/PwC6F) of outfits with fedoras that maybe don't look quite as bad as the ones you usually see. The point is that here the hat is **cohesive** with the outfit, as I said it's quite hard to make it work.

**A short note on ""breaking the rules""**

&gt;*John Cage didn’t simply stick a bunch of spoons inside a piano and compose avant-garde masterpieces – his prepared piano pieces were an organic development out of years of studying

-Syeknom

Keep in mind that these guidelines are just here to help you understand fashion better, of course, possible to look good even if you break some of these rules, for example wearing [formal pieces](http://cdn.dressed.so/i/50633f7f59891l.jpg) in casual outfits (thanks veroz). The thing is that, if you try this as a beginner, you're most likely to fail.

I went to replaced my order but the coupon had been used. I decided to e-mail them letting them know of my issue and they said they could hold my order with the discount and I would just have to call to confirm everything. I wasn't able to call back until today and sadly the items I wanted were out of stock in the colors I wanted. They looked through the site with me and we couldn't find any acceptable replacements. 

I figured this was the end of it as it was my fault for hitting cancel and it isn't like they are obligated to do more than hold the order until I can get back to them. Instead

I am blown away by the lengths they made to make me happy when I wasn't upset in the first place and even considered the mistake was on my end. I highly recommend J Crew now just because of their customer service. They could not have been more kind and accommodating. 

Thank you J Crew

Decided to throw together this guide / ramble / inspiration because even if it helps one person I'll feel like it's gone to use. I've always been conscious of what I wore but it wasn't until around 19 / 20 years old when my maturity began to show in my clothing choices. I had direction, it's not for everyone, but for those willing to take the time, hopefully this “guide to thrifting” will help you make the most of your treasure hunts. 

First off, they either don't have the time, or they don't have the interest, but if you've decided thrifting is for you then that's awesome. For me, thrifting is relaxing. It's a chance for me to wander the isles at my own leisure, not be bugged by pesky sales pressure and it's as if I have an entirely new wardrobe to play with. If nothing else, it has served as some time for me to escape from my busy schedule; finding anything to take home on top of that is simply a bonus. That is definitely the attitude you need to have if you're going to start thrifting. You will not find something EVERY single time you go. Some days it's as if your twin just dropped off a bunch of clothes for you, frequency is the key to success. 


There are three things that are important to note when you hit the stores and actually start looking for items:

**1) Condition of the piece** 

**2) Price of the piece**

**3) Fit of the piece** 




****
**1) Condition of the piece:**

It should be common knowledge that almost everything in thrift stores has been preowned and due to this fact

Ex:

- look for stains on the collars and cuffs of dress shirts as well as the arm pits. If it's a shirt you aren't in love with, something you can't just put back regardless of the stains, [here's a guide that has yet to fail me](http://putthison.com/post/441812762/cleaningshirts).

- look for any holes, missing buttons, broken zips etc. I personally find the details in a mans outfit to be the things that contribute to his style the most. It's hard to look stylish with holes in your crotch or cuff buttons missing. That being said, know what you can fix. Many shirts and jackets have extra buttons sewn to the inside of the garment in case you do manage to lose one. This will save you the hassle of trying to match a spare button and 5 mins with a needle and thread and you're as good as new. I don't usually bother with broken zips, but if you need it fixed, your local tailor should be able to replace it for around $15 depending on the job. Holes are sometimes hard to spot first time around. A quick check is to hold it up to the light, holes will jump out at you right away. 

Bottom line

**2) Price of the piece:**

Back when I first started thrifting it seemed that places were almost paying YOU to take the clothes because the prices were so cheap. Recently though, awesome, if you know how much it's going for on sites like ebay, even better. This is why a smartphone is your best tool to carry on your scavenger hunts. If you can quickly search an item, you may find out that just because the piece is in a thrift store doesn't mean it's the best deal you can get. However, alot can be said for physically having that item in front of you where you can try it on and inspect it. If ebay listing are within 20% of the thrifted item (accounting for s&amp;h), then I usually go with the thrifted item because I know EXACTLY what I'm getting. More than 20% though and the savings online are just too enticing to overcome. 

You also need to account for after purchase spending

Bottom line

**3) Fit of the piece** 

If you've been lurking around MFA for a while I'm sure that you've realized that fit is of the utmost importance to a successful outfit. You've heard it countless times but a well fitting cheap suit is going to look better than an expensive suit that looks like a hand-me-down from your overweight uncle with enough excess material to shelter a small family. This is where beginners can really benefit from thrifting. You will undoubtedly make mistakes with fit early on in your search for style, worn it past the return date and then woke up one morning thinking “jesus.....when did I think wearing a sail was acceptable as a dress shirt?” Culminating your style is a long process, most of us do not have the money to experiment and iron out the kinks, but with thrifting, you can learn those lessons quicker and with smaller consequences. There's only so much you can learn from viewing posts of “correct fit” and what not. Get out there, use the knowledge you have to get the best fit you can find, and then fine tune from there. Whether you like it or not fashion has become a hobby for you, it's time to move into tailoring.

**Tailoring:**

This is where thrifting pays off the most. Because you've kept your initial costs down when buying an item, know whats WORTH tailoring. If a jacket needs to be completely reconstructed, chances are that the price to tailor it will exceed what you would pay for that item in stores (ofcourse this is different if it's some $1500 designer jacket). Something as simple as lengthening the sleeves can take a jacket from just off to just right. 


*****************BUY A SEWING MACHINE *******************

If you haven't already, or the legs are just a tiny bit too wide. Before I would just throw them back to the piles and be bitter that it didn't come how I wanted it. Well now, no problem, I MAKE it the way I want it. One point though is when I recommend this to people they think that a sewing machine will solve all their problems right away. That's not going to happen. It's frustrating at first, time consuming, some of my frankenstein creations early on should never have seen the light of day, but if you stick at it you get quicker and cleaner, there are plenty of great guides out there to get you started

Here's some [before](http://i.imgur.com/P2wLXN9.jpg) and [after](http://i.imgur.com/FZM6FNL.jpg)  projects. [Before](http://i.imgur.com/Ig4ffmH.jpg?1) and [After](http://i.imgur.com/neXRcjO.jpg?1)

**Quick Tips:**

If you're a little pressed for time

- Develop a system. I have an order for the sections I look at in a store. It goes shoes, pants, t-shirts, bags, accessories. Most of that is just personal preference but the shoes I recommend being first. If you find a pair that you like, put them on while you browse through the rest of the store, you'll find out pretty quickly if they're going to be comfortable or not. Building a system also takes the guess work out of missing something. If you follow your order you will have looked through the entire stock and not missed a thing. 

- Your sense of touch is your best friend. When out in retail stores you should be getting acquainted with what “quality” feels like. Touch the clothes, just generally well made, this one is tougher to explain but it's something that you will develop over time. Once you know what quality feels like, you can apply it to thrifting. Put the palm of your hand on the the clothing and start walking down the isle, you'll know when to stop and take a better look. 

* Know what you need and stick to it. I don't usually recommend this because sometimes the best finds are unexpected, but again, if you're in a rush you will have to pass on the chance that there's something worth while mislabeled. 

**General Tips**

* don't be afraid to look in the woman's section. They often have more interesting fabrics and patterns than guys clothing. The thing that gives away that you may be wearing womens clothing (apart from the fact that they button opposite to mens clothing) is the cut. Extra room in the chest, but now since you're a master a DIY tailoring (because you bought a sewing machine like I told you) you can alter the fit completely. Now, apart from the buttons on the other side, noone is the wiser. Plus they sometimes put mens belts in the womens section and 9 times out of 10 you'll be able to find pocket squares in with their scarves. 
See the potential in an item. Things that catch my eye are the unique pieces. I have the basics (OCBD's, you need to see how it would fit in your wardrobe, how you could alter it to make it better, how it could be something you could enjoy later as your style evolves. Thrift stores are full of one offs, capitalize on this and you'll have an individual piece you can call your own. 

* **KEEP TRACK OF YOUR SPENDING**. I keep a little book in my room that I note every purchase I make. It's hard to keep track of how much you are REALLY spending because $5 doesn't seem like much, $7 there and it begins to add up. 

* Buy out of season. Thrift stores operate through donations. Now it doesn't make sense that someone is going to donate their wool pea coat in the dead of winter when they would still most likely need it. Instead, the day it is no longer stylish will be a dark day, so things like that will be a solid purchase. 



Now this isn't to brag about my wardrobe because there are others on MFA that have far more impressive wardrobes

1356016242.0,15649d,A Basic Guide to Target ,Contrapaul,2652,762,364,"Where I live there are quite literally Targets everywhere

Because of the amount of time I've spent in Target, I have some knowledge about what is good, what is bad, and how to win at Target. I'm going to outline what you can and should purchase, what to avoid, and most importantly, when to purchase certain things.

**Brands at Target**
 
While there are plenty of different clothing brands in Target, Merona, and Converse One Star.
 
**Mossimo Supply Co.** is Target's [younger](http://i.imgur.com/dMFvQ.jpg), though while [shirts](http://i.imgur.com/6eE9O.jpg) and hoodies are plentiful, the brand has less outerwear than either other brand, which is too bad. Mossimo is great for picking up some basic items, and the value for the money is great on lots of them- but not all.
 
Fit is [""athletic""](http://i.imgur.com/ZZM9v.jpg) on lots of things, or just wrong- like their [twill 5-pocket pants](http://i.imgur.com/k5rYo.jpg) that boast a ""relaxed fit"" in areas. These pants are not relaxed. Jackets are also a little weird, with similar items sometimes fitting very differently. Their filled windbreaker fits me fine as a small, but a similar looking [hooded windbreaker](http://i.imgur.com/GJnKV.jpg) is unattractively large at the same size.
 
As mentioned, and the quality is very [good](http://i.imgur.com/5higo.jpg) for ~$10. Mine never seem to shrink or stretch, and I've been complimented lots of times on these tees. [Layering items](http://i.imgur.com/yGEtu.jpg), like [henleys](http://i.imgur.com/vXrdy.jpg), [baseball shirts](http://i.imgur.com/Xf1dF.jpg), and [hoodies](http://i.imgur.com/kldHR.jpg) are similar in quality and fit, and come in a wide array of colors. [Mossimo pants](http://i.imgur.com/KEYvX.jpg), are decent quality for the price, stripes

Other items of note: [Cords that are $20-$25

[Full Album of Mossimo Picks](http://imgur.com/a/xCXTG)
 
**Merona** is Target's more formal brand, but not across the board. Merona has plenty of items in ['classic' colors](http://i.imgur.com/rWxGi.jpg), like [navy](http://i.imgur.com/NpLZU.jpg), [tan](http://i.imgur.com/Vvakm.jpg), [grey](http://i.imgur.com/kHiFu.jpg), and [black](http://i.imgur.com/vFJCz.jpg), and of late has added [brighter](http://i.imgur.com/aZnZM.jpg) [colors](http://i.imgur.com/kmWSZ.jpg) to a number of items. They provide an entry-level selection for plenty of [business-casual](http://i.imgur.com/3lZJm.jpg) [items](http://i.imgur.com/1YSM4.jpg)
 
A bunch of Merona items feature a ""tailored fit"", and were baggy everywhere else. A [medium sweater](http://i.imgur.com/NLrIX.jpg) may fit too large, and be next to a [medium cardigan](http://i.imgur.com/ekoKe.jpg) that fits perfectly, next to a [medium jacket](http://i.imgur.com/tb0sy.jpg) which fits like a small. Generally *a* size will probably work, but occasionally you'll wish that XS and MS existed in men's at Target.
 
Merona [""Ultimate Dress Shirts""](http://i.imgur.com/O97sP.jpg) get touted on Dappered often, and made from decent fabric- but fit can vary color to color, and even piece to piece. There are also [Merona](http://i.imgur.com/Kdha9.jpg) [accessories](http://i.imgur.com/vCc5a.jpg) which are not bad for the price, don't buy the ties though- they're overpriced and unimpressive.

Other items of note: [Twill shirt that is thick enough to be a light jacket](http://i.imgur.com/tzBT4.jpg), [$4 beanies that feel like *at least* $8 beanies](http://i.imgur.com/AmRnd.jpg).

[Full Album of Merona Picks](http://imgur.com/a/5xi5C) 

**Converse One Star** is Target's smaller, and more [grungy](http://i.imgur.com/leotA.jpg) than Mossimo, and while the styles are more [unique](http://i.imgur.com/EgWiY.jpg), the [colors](http://i.imgur.com/jl68J.jpg) are [muted](http://i.imgur.com/DH5CK.jpg). [Olive](http://i.imgur.com/HcMLx.jpg), [grey](http://i.imgur.com/Cu15H.jpg), [black](http://i.imgur.com/29wTR.jpg), [cream](http://i.imgur.com/acmsN.jpg), which can be a bit disappointing
 
Fit in general tends to be a bit big, fitting less close than my medium Uniqlo mountain parka. It's also pretty long, which looks good on my 6'2"" frame, but I imagine a 5'9"" guy weighing 150lbs would be dwarfed in the thing.
 
The cloth on their [shirts](http://i.imgur.com/TDTTB.jpg) is soft and [comfortable](http://i.imgur.com/qcsyw.jpg), such as this [weekend bag](http://i.imgur.com/qCIsx.jpg), that aren't bad- though I'd remove branding.

It was inspired by [this comment thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/15qah9/transman_body_shape_fashion/c7oy74b) between /u/jdbee and /u/alilja.  So I decided to see if I couldn't compile a bunch of threads that MFA has seen in the past year or so to show that MFA is more diverse and open-minded than the rest of reddit thinks.

**Why does reddit think this?**

/u/Balloons_lol explains it with an [excellent analogy:](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/15qa3b/simple_questions_dec_31st/c7ozqn0)

&gt;think of it like this. imagine you're in the market for a new chair for your desk. simple enough. last week

&gt;so you post a link to the chair you wanted (or in some cases

&gt;you get downvoted instantly. the criticism are that the color is a dull grey and looks bad, it's not made by a japanese guy with a ponytail, etc. suddenly you realize there is a massive subculture about something you put in little to no thought about. ""they're just fucking"" chairs you say, and your comment goes way below threshold.

&gt;then in askreddit you complain about how pretentious these chair people are

&gt;we're just unfortunate in that everyone is forced to wear clothing and nobody wants to feel like they're bad at it. so when they ask for advice and realize they actually dress pretty badly

**Breaking the Rules:**

MFA has often been criticized as stuck-up and snobby for giving out advice based on a set of ""arbitrary"" and ""unbreakable"" fashion rules.  There's also the idea that MFA ""hates"" certain items.  But that's not true at all.  These ""rules"" aren't set in stone... they're more like guidelines.  In the case of beginners, some come out believing that there is a list of fashion rules you can and can't break, and they don't understand how or why these ""rules"" come to be.  Thus, the myth of the fashion ""rulebook"" is perpetuated. /u/Syeknom has a great [blog post](http://fashionandacupoftea.com/on-fashion-rules/) on this.

And as /u/ newgale explains it, the ""rules"" can be broken intentionally in an outfit and work well:

This is perhaps the best evidence that MFA caters to aesthetics beyond the 'stereotypical' ""peacoat/pointer chore coat + light blue ocdb + khaki chinos/dark selvedge denim + CDB/AE Strand"" that is the ""MFA uniform"". I think /u/reverendglasseye [puts it well:](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/145etr/november_2012_top_of_waywt/c7a4q9w)

And there you have it.  There's a lot to MFA beyond the ""MFA uniform"" that everyone complains about.  Remember that MFA is a beginner's forum, ""It's like how in sports, you just don't play however you like. One must first learn the rules of the game.""  Or how in music, you should be able to play a scale before you can start playing Mozart.  Teaching the basics of style, in my opinion, is the first great thing that MFA does well. We can help you get a solid footing with a firm grasp on the basics of looking good, and help with simple questions and fit checks.


But developing a good aesthetic and sense of style is something that cannot be spoon-fed.  Just like how you haven't gained anything if you rely on having people tell you what to think of a new book; you can't look good if you don't understand how your clothes work together, and the WAYWTs and inspiration albums are a great place to find inspiration. 

There's lots of good advice given for a variety of styles. That's what MFA is about.

*Do what you want to do. See what you want to see. Go where you want to go. Be who you want to be. Be who you've got to be. Be who you're made to be

Ever since 2002, the most versatile shoe on the planet: They are at home in streetwear

Take a look at [this streetwear fit.](http://i.imgur.com/D3nb7Md.jpg) Already, what really makes it is the masterful shoe pairing. This is a great example of how to work Crocs into your personal style: in this outfit, they are both subtle and daring, the focus of attention and a smooth complement to an already cohesive outfit. If you're feeling really daring with your choice of shoes and want to jump on the collab hype train but can't quite afford copping those Supreme x Vans, I'd suggest the far more versatile, artisan [Batman x Crocs] (http://i.imgur.com/m8QGqmwh.jpg) collab for an easy, comfortable, above all

Crocs and preppy styles go together like Uniqlo OBCDs and Timex Weekenders. Few and far between are shoes that work so well in such different contexts, we can go even simpler. [This snapshot](http://i.imgur.com/j7vmDvu.jpg) from the Crocs catalog itself perfectly embodies the spirit of what Crocs will help you achieve in a preppy outfit: it's casual, comfortable, fun, and, above all, dapper as hell.

Crocs are so versatile they will even blend effortlessly into your ""nxtlvl"" goth ninja style. Take a look at the gentleman on the right side of [this picture:](http://i.imgur.com/yqqqxs4.jpg) he's pulling a classic goth ninja look. The drapes on the ~~ill-fitting~~ nxtlvl black pants and the smooth lines of the black t-shirt juxtaposed with the straighter (yet still loose) lines of the black blazer make this classic look. The Crocs in this outfit are a beautiful addition: they breathe excitement, and new life into an already-classic look. Forget black Doc Martens, Crocs will take you far beyond nxtlvl into the realm of StyleZeitgeist heaven.

**PREFACE**
*****
With over 50

This guide applies to **all** ages, or self-perceived personal archetypes.  This guide lists the basics and fundamentals of the mens wardrobe and will point to some budget-minded options for this.  Read this guide understanding that a lot of noobs can't afford $150 shirts.  Remember though, generally, you get what you pay for.

**Fit is king**, nothing can make expensive clothes look cheap like a bad fit.  Tagged clothing size varies widely by manufacturer, a small isn't always a small and a large might be a medium.  

Check out the guide to ['How Clothes Should Fit']( http://redd.it/ehrtv) for more info.

**SECTION I – PANTS**
*****
**Jeans** - The blue jean is a classic part of American workwear and a staple to any man’s wardrobe you can imagine.  Anyone can wear these.  Stick with a dark indigo wash.  Avoid bootcut jeans

* [**Levi’s 511** – Clean Dark - $39.99](http://amzn.com/B004D4Y42Y) – Slim fitting
* [**Levi’s 508** – Rigid Envy - $39.99](http://amzn.com/B0051712UO) – Very similar to the 511
* [**Levi’s 501** – Clean Rigid - $42.99](http://amzn.com/B0018ON68A) – The 'original' denim cut

**Chinos** - Colloquially known as 'khakis'

* [**Dockers Alpha Khaki** - $39.99](http://amzn.com/B004VQBJFE) – These fit slim, consider navy or the earth tones.
* [**Dockers D1 Slim Fit** - $39.99](http://amzn.com/B002AQ23G6) - These fit like 514s

**Cords** -  AKA Corduroy pants.  Lots of people wear these as kids.  Again

**Shorts** -  Avoid cargo pockets.  Slim

**SECTION II – THE SHIRT**
*****
Someone said that a shirt’s collar frames the face

* [**Mossimo V-Neck Tees** - $7.99](http://goo.gl/urp1m) – Multiple colors – you can find these at target
* **Similar Tees from LEC**: [**Crew**](http://bit.ly/FPG19C) and [**V**](http://bit.ly/uxw6GF)
There are however other shirts available too
* [**LEC Polos** - $9.99](http://bit.ly/wU9GFg) – Multiple colors

**Button Ups** – Stick with long sleeved versions for now.  Keep em’ close to the body

* [**Lands End Canvas** - $20-30](http://bit.ly/vlRwtx) – They have sales on all the time
* **Alfani Red** [**“Dress Shirts”** - $20-$30 - **“Sport Shirts”** - $20-$30](http://bit.ly/x5rRGs)  – These are decent slim shirts on a budget
* **Bar III** [**“Dress Shirts”** - $30-60](http://bit.ly/zGGGCJ) – More from Macy's
* **H&amp;M** - $15-30 - H&amp;M doesn't do e-commerce
* [**J. Crew Factory Button-Ups** - $15-40](http://bit.ly/uA7pnJ) - J. Crew's outlet store

**SECTION III – THE LAYERS**
*****
 “Winter is coming.”  So what do you wear?  I like sweaters and cardigans

* [**Merona V-Neck** - $22.99](http://bit.ly/u5TiDf) – Collars frame the face
* [**LEC Sweaters
* [**American Apparel Cardigans** - $20-30](http://bit.ly/xTBdOm) – Simple and basic
* [**American Apparel Hoodies** - $20-30](http://bit.ly/Awo6Xx) – Some people say hoodies are immature
* [**J. Crew Factory Knits** - $25-50](http://bit.ly/uapEKT) - Again

**SECTION IV – THE SHOES**
*****
Before I learned how to dress myself, rounded toebox that accentuates the shape of the feet.  Avoid clunky soles, bulky toeboxes, square/pointed toes and pointless/gaudy stitching.**  Shoes are often the most expensive part of an outfit, so I’m only going over some cheap basics.  

* **Canvas Sneakers** -  [**Converse Chuck Taylor All Star** - $45](http://bit.ly/m8xmJ1) - [**Vans Authentic** - $45](http://bit.ly/s7pK9g) – These are basic low-top canvas sneakers
* **Desert Boots** - [**Clarks** - $60-80](http://amzn.to/rFt7iP) – I have developed a loathing for these boots now
* **Brown Boots** -[**LL Bean Katahdin Engineer Boots** - $159](http://bit.ly/t5IEHp) - A solid, but the soles aren't lugged.  Would go great matched with jeans.
* **Wingtips 'Dress Shoes'** - [**Florsheim** - $100+](http://bit.ly/rZ34hs) - The perforations or broguing on these 'dress' shoes make them more casual

**SECTION V – ACCESSORIES**
*****
Accessories, but leave that to the pros.  Two basic accessories that can work for any man are a belt and a watch.

* [**The Timex Weekender** - $40](http://amzn.to/tAicM4) – Ah, with a lot of options for being you in the strap.  Just please don’t post a picture of it when you get one.  Black faces are more casual than white watch faces.
* [**4 STR / 4 STA Leather Belt** - $35](http://bit.ly/slshCg) – I got a decent leather belt from this store on ebay.  The wider the belt the more casual, try to match the color with your belt.

**CLOSING THOUGHTS**
*****
Here are a few brick and mortar/mall stores which you can easily find some reasonably priced basics in person.

* [**H&amp;M**](http://www.hm.com) - Cheap
* [**Gap**](http://www.gap.com) - I feel like the design of Gap clothing isn't as nice as some other retailers
* [**Zara**](http://www.zara.com) - Cheap
* [**J. Crew Factiory**](http://www.jcrew.com/factory) - J. Crew’s factory line.
* [**Uniqlo**](http://www.uniqlo.com) - Only available in New York

There have been some Reddit MFA threads about Allen Edmonds shoes lately and my college-aged son, so it seems a great idea to me.  I'll be online starting at about 1 pm today until 3pm.   Then I'll come back on over the weekend sometime and Monday to answer remaining questions. Anything related to shoes, manufacturing, Made in USA, Allen Edmonds 90 year history, men's fashion trends, regional differences

Beginning leathercraft is very simple and easy to get into. You probably have a leather goods store in your area. Tandy Leather Factory is a nationwide chain (also in Canada and the UK)


Things you'll need to buy.

* [Belt blank $10](http://www.tandyleatherfactory.com/en-usd/home/department/Leather-Belts-Leather-Straps/44518-186.aspx). You can use any width but 1.5"" is the max width for most of my jeans' belt loops. Make sure you buy a full-grain

* [Belt buckle $1-20](http://www.tandyleatherfactory.com/en-usd/home/department/Buckles/Utility-Buckles/Utility-Buckles.aspx). Use any buckle you want. Get one from a vintage store or online. The width of the buckle and the belt blank need to be the same. 

* [(optional) Belt keep of matching width $1](http://www.tandyleatherfactory.com/en-usd/home/department/Leather-Belts-Leather-Straps/4600-04.aspx). You can get a metal belt keep

* [(optional) All-in-one water based dye $9](http://www.tandyleatherfactory.com/en-usd/home/department/Liquids-N/Dyes-Antiques/2605-133.aspx). This is a good dye for beginners. It won't rub off on clothing or skin after the dye has dried (about 24 hours). Forego the dye if you want a natural or nude colored belt. 

*  If you don't already have a rotary punch

[**Imgur guide**](http://imgur.com/a/fwvYt#0)

[You might want to slick the edges of the belt](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/k6uro/how_to_make_a_100_belt_on_the_cheap/c2i0jx2)


**PSA against genuine leather:** Genuine leather is not synonymous with authentic or real leather. Genuine leather is actually a grade of leather. In fact

There are a couple things MFA'ers always complain about having to do with the community on this subreddit.

1. The Hivemind/MFA uniform that many people say decreases the amount of creativity and the diversity of styles in the subreddit.  
2. A heavy focus on the basics of fit and style that can leave some of the more daring and experienced members feeling underwhelmed.  
  
What I'd like to do is have a weekly fashion challenge post with a theme that challenges posters to shake things up a bit and put their stylistic skills to the test. For example, one could be required to prominently feature a graphic tee and so on and so forth with as many as we can think of.   
In order to keep it organized

**TL;DR: Should have weekly ""best dressed"" competitions that require posters to break rules or go out on a limb**

### Shape/Length/Type/Size

---

A [diagram](http://i.imgur.com/qsmuo6x.jpg) ^[via](http://www.mcgregorsocks.com/sock_facts.html) mostly for the silhouettes

#### Standard socks

* over-the-calf / dress / long / tall / knee-high / executive / full-length socks
* mid-calf / crew / half-length socks
* ankle / anklet / sport / short / quarter-length socks

Formal attire traditionally requires long/dress socks (to prevent any flashes of visible skin


#### Unseen Socks

* no-show / liner / loafer / invisible / ped / low / footie socks

The Naming of unseen socks is **wildly non-standard**. Socks named ""no-show"" might be anything from [minimal](http://i.imgur.com/Pnqgte9.jpg) ([C.K.s](http://www.amazon.com/Calvin-Klein-Mens-Liner-Socks/dp/B007KZ2IHG/)) all the way up to the [ankle bone](http://i.imgur.com/YHyDCzo.png) ([Hanes](http://www.hanes.com/clothing/men/socks/low-cut---no-show-socks)).

See this comparison of 2 ""invisible"" brands

---
### Material

---

* **Get Wool**: Good moisture wicking. Good temperature control. Good durability. - Some people find/think of them as itchy; getting good quality (fine/ultrafine) wool, are the ones that itch - which is more of a problem/memory of vintage/hand-me-down/heirloom wool, or cheap wool.
* **Be careful with cotton**: Cotton is moisture-absorbant (not wicking), they'll smell worse by day's end. Cotton is less durable, and less springy once compressed, compared to wool. Cheap cotton socks are prolific, and often badly shaped/cut/stitched. This has led to the opinion that [Cotton sucks for socks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/17l7zg/guide_request_socks/c86jwdd). Keep this in mind, and you'll be fine.
* **Blends are good**. An addition of *x* can add good properties to the material (elasticity,308,30.html), which covers: acrylic, cotton, linen, nylon, rayon

If layering

SmartWool is just a brand of [merino](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merino) sheep wool, and a resin coating. It turns these [rough raw edges](http://i.imgur.com/Gdi34vx.jpg), into this [smoother surface](http://i.imgur.com/tpOZAL1.jpg), to prevent the fibres catching on each other as they move around, which is why untreated-wool ""shrinks"". Many other companies do the same thing.

---
### Color/Pattern

---

* **Basic/Daily/Standard**: Match your pant color, and extending your leg thereby making you look taller. (If you match your shoe color, it can give your shoe the illusion of being a deformed boot. Badbadbad.)

    I.e. Dark grey/blue/brown socks with denim/navy pants. Dark brown/grey/blue socks with khaki pants. Thin black socks only with black or dark-grey pants (Never thick black gym socks.). Never white
* **Intermediate**: Compliment (not clash) the color of your pants. Use solid colors
* **Advanced**: Be Bold. Experiment. Match the color of your tie/shirt/eyes/pocketsquare/SO's outfit/etc. 

    This [can](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/ktahl/i_have_a_guilty_pleasure_to_confess_but_as_they/) rapidly [get](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/hy2zq/picked_up_my_first_batch_of_loud_socks_whaddya/) quite [extensive](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/iebl6/mfa_its_time_to_post_your_sock_collections_ill/)

    Advanced because: It can easily go horribly wrong

*Caveat*: Bright/Loud/Silly/Novelty socks will get commented on, and politely comment on them to cover my laughter and staring. Are you color-blind or going to clown-school?*""

---
### Size

---

* Not Too Tight. One size does NOT fit all. Buy a trial pair of any new sock brand/model, your real sock size is 1 or 2 times larger than your shoe size. YMMV.

---
### Care

---

* Washing: For high quality socks, and deforms the knit. For longer life: hand wash, and always hang dry.)
* Storage: Folding or Rolling
* Stop wearing socks once damage is visible.
* Use old socks as rags, to make your own swiffer-esque rags.)

---
### Sockless

---
For dry and clean feet:

* Avoid wearing the same pair of shoes for two days in a row. **Air them out**. (Good advice
* Try wool (moisture-wicking) or terrycloth (moisture-absorbant) insoles. Wash them regularly.
* Try a light daily dusting of goldbond foot powder (but beware barefoot footprints
* Try an unvarnished-cedar shoe-tree.

To prevent blisters from new shoes:

* Break-in stiff/new shoes with socks (around your home)

1365690923.0,1c4x1f,"Prom is coming up in about a month, and I've decided that I would like to buy a suit rather than rent a tuxedo. I've read the sidebar, but I still have a few questions regarding buying, colors, shoes,CheeseBurrito,http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1c4x1f/prom_is_coming_up_in_about_a_month_and_ive/

I haven't held a steady job this school year, I'm fairly limited on how much I can spend on a suit, shirt, tie, and shoes. If I were to make an estimate right now, I'd say that I have about $250 for the suit, $100-$150 for shoes, tie

I'd really love to get at least my jacket and pants from J. Crew, but I'm not really sure I can convince my parents to allow me to spend the extra money. I've already tried convincing my mother that the suits are probably going to last longer and fit better if I buy them from a higher end store, but she won't really have any of it. So unless there's a surefire way to change her mind, I pretty much have to go to Macy's or J.C. Penny. I understand that both stores are pretty good for the prices, so I'm not going to fuss about it. Just in case though, are there any other retailers I should look at? I live in Central Ohio, so I'm guessing that my options are fairly limited. I've also given Indochino a look, I'd rather only rely on online ordering if I absolutely have to. So first question

**Color**

Since the event is prom

For the color of my suit, I'm thinking a white shirt with a black skinny tie. I'm not sure about the colors though, honestly. If at all possible, I'd like to get a pocket square too. Should I just go with a plain white? Or could I get a color that matches my date's dress?

Overall

**Style**

I don't know too much about what kind of style I should buy. I know I want a two button jacket and pants without pleats (this is a rule

I'm thinking of going with something slimmer (I'm 6'1"" 160 lbs.) if that helps.

Should I be making a big deal about the material of the suit? I honestly have no idea what I should go with

**Shoes**

I'm thinking of a brown pair of shoes just because they're much more versatile for other outfits than black is. I have no idea what brands I should be looking at though. I'd love to buy a pair of Allen Edmond's

**Belt** 

Should I match the color of my belt to my shoes?  

I think that covers everything. I'll be glad to clear anything up if needed. Thanks!

Today I'll be doing the color navy.

**History**

The color navy originated with the British Royal Navy in the mid 1700s when it was first used as a color of their uniforms

**Usage in Menswear**


Navy is and has been a staple of menswear for many years because of its versatility in the common man's wardrobe. The reason it is so common is because men's fashion is very skewed towards [earth tones](http://bobby-lin.com/parsons/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/COLOURlovers.com-Muted_Earth_Tones.png). Earth tones are typically defined as soft

Furthermore navy is a very unoffending color in itself

A word of note

**Why is it used over black?**

I'm sure you've all heard the ""rule"" that black goes with everything. I'm here to tell you that navy goes better with most things black does. Some of this I suppose is a push by the fashion community to get rid of this rule to some extent. Another reason is that black is seen as very, etc.) To me, though, the biggest reason navy is more versatile than black is because it is less stark. Take a look at this [picture](http://imgur.com/XhorcCs) versus a similar [picture](http://imgur.com/QgqAP6Y). Notice how the lessened amount of contrast allows for an easier look on the eyes. This makes navy more desirable for the beginner just learning color theory or trying to dress well.

(For what it's worth

Let me briefly outline three reasons.  [I also pulled a short album together of shorts done well - ](http://imgur.com/a/OcgoR)

 * **Function.**    Shorts, right?  It's 80, 90, *100+* degrees, and pants feel unbearable.  If exposing skin to cool off is the goal, [why stop at half-pants?](http://i.imgur.com/zfVMXqq.jpg)  

 * **Aesthetics.**  In my opinion, that there are some styles where doing the opposite of this is a deliberate choice).  [Shorts that cover the knee](http://i.imgur.com/RIvotyT.jpg) are a wide hem at the narrowest point of your lower body, when what you want is just the opposite. Counterintuitively, this means longer shorts make scrawny legs look even skinnier.  Longer shorts also visually shorten your legs, and make them look truncated and stumpy.  Shorts that show the quadricep head ([vastus medialis](http://i.imgur.com/En6o3mD.jpg)) on the other hand, make your legs look longer and stronger [(even if they aren't really either of those).](http://i.imgur.com/t4FbMZ7.jpg)

 * **Confidence.**  Past discussions about shorts on MFA have involved a fair amount of body-shaming and stereotyping - ""no one wants to see man-thigh"", but there's something to be said for being confident and wearing what works instead of being cowered by silly fears and shallow stereotypes.

**(1) What is the difference between ""cologne""

 These three titles differentiate between the different concentration of oils in the fragrance. Eau de toilette is the most common


Cologne ~ 5%

Eau de Toilette ~ 10% 

Perfume ~ 15%



**(2) What types of fragrances are there?**



Fragrances break down into two types: designer and niche.
 


Designer fragrances are the most common. These are the fragrances made by companies like Armani, and other designer brands. A typical designer fragrance will cost between $50 and $100. These fragrances tend to be mass-produced, and are designed to be sold to many people. They're made to have as wide of an appeal as possible, and so are typically safer than niche fragrances. Because these fragrances are mass-produced, they tend to be made from cheaper materials.



A niche fragrance is typically made from more expensive/higher-quality ingredients. Companies in the niche fragrance game make their fragrances for a more selective customer who wishes to wear something more bold or unique. These fragrances will not have the universal appeal that designer fragrances will have. Instead, niche fragrances are to fragrances. These fragrances will typically cost more than $250. Because these fragrances are so bold and expensive, they are not what the typical man is looking for in a scent, and so this list will not mention them again. 



From there, and so it won't jump off your skin. On the other hand, wearing a scent that is too sweet or has too many spices in it during hot days will often make people nauseous. 



**(3) The break down of a fragrance:**



Fragrances break down into three sets of notes (the ingredients/scents which give the fragrance its smell): the top, the middle notes for 3 to 5 hours, and the base notes ten to last from 5 to 10 hours. As the notes dry up, the scent will change, allowing for the scents to evolve and be more interesting. Typically (but not always for sure) the mark of a low-quality fragrance is if it remains monotone throughout its life. 



Typical base notes are sandalwood, tar, tobacco, and musk notes. 
Typical top and middle notes are various floral scents, and spices such as cinnamon. 



**(4) How to distinguish between a high quality fragrance and a low quality fragrance:**



There are several key factors in determining whether a fragrance is good. They are longevity, then what is the point of wearing anything?



A good summer fragrance will not last as long as most winter fragrances typically because they are made from the more natural aquatic/citrusy notes. These notes tend to evaporate within five hours. A good summer fragrance should last you around five to seven hours. 



Winter fragrances



When looking for a fragrance to purchase



Uniqueness of a scent is often overlooked by most men. Your clothes are an outward expression of how you view yourself. The same goes for fragrances. Different scents carry different vibes, and so if you are wearing scents that are unremarkable or common, you'll smell like everyone else. 



**(5) What are some good designer fragrances?**


Burberry- Brit



Bvlgari-Aqua



Carolina Herrera- 212 Men



Chanel- Allure Homme, Platinum Egioste



Christian Dior- Fahrenheit



Davidoff- Cool Water


Diesel- Fuel for Life



Dolce &amp; Gabbana- The One


Hugo Boss- Boss Bottled (Boss #6)



Givenchy- Pi


Gucci- Por Homme




Issey Miyake- L'eau D'Issey Por Homme




Jean Paul Gaultier- Le Male




Joop!- Joop! Homme



Lancome- Hypnose



Paco Rabanne- One Million




Serge Lutens- Chergui




Thierry Muglier- Anything




Tom Ford- Grey Vetiver



Versace- The Dreamer



Viktor and Rolfe- Spicebomb (I've only tried this once



Yves Saint Laurent- L'Homme and La Nuit de L'Homme, Body Kurous




Please note that this list is very short


I recommend watching online reviews. Two reviewers that I like are 
[Mark](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rur2b07inPI) and [Tim](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGSQqPqW2jY). Both of them give very in-depth reviews. By watching their videos


**(6) What are some companies to stay away from?**



Armani- There are only two Armani fragrances worth looking into: Aqua di Gio and Code. Both of these have been in the top sellers list since their inception. They are not bad necessarily



Calvin Klein-Their colognes flat out suck. They are not unique



The high school companies- These companies are Abercrombie and Hollister. These fragrances arn't low quality

**(7) Where do I buy fragrances and where can I get samples?**




Please buy your fragrances from a reputable dealer. Rip-offs are rampant and are often made from inferior ingredients that can be dangerous when applied to the skin.




With that in mind




In terms of samples




Fragrances come in many different bottle sizes, you don't know how often you will be wearing it, and your tastes will probably change once you get the chance to smell a lot of different things. You would hate it if you were only a forth of the way through an expensive bottle and you didn't care for it anymore. 



**(8) How much to wear



You should begin with wearing one or two sprays on the neck. A lot of blood rushes through your neck, you won't be able to smell your fragrance about an hour or two into wearing it. This doesn't mean that it isn't there. So please don't keep reapplying it whenever you can't smell it. 



Spraying a fragrance in the air and walking through it is worthless. Do not spray a fragrance on your clothes. The fragrance isn't allowed to mix with your oils



You should store your fragrances in their original boxes, dry, and cool environments. Your bedroom will suffice.

1328201091.0,p7usf,Shoe Guide v2.0,jdbee,1192,225,401,"I really enjoyed working on the new Spring/Summer guide a couple weeks ago

I've organized this into four sections - (I) sneakers, and (IV) storage &amp; care.  I won't address boots, since [they have their own guide](http://redd.it/kc9f2).  

I tried to keep budget in mind, high-quality shoes can last for years though, and no one is suggesting that you drop $1200 this weekend.  Invest in your shoe wardrobe slowly, focusing on craftsmanship, durability, and versatility.  A couple days ago, someone asked about a cheaper version of [this pair of blue suede blucher mocs from Oak Street Bootmakers](http://oakstreetbootmakers.com/footwear/navy-suede-red-brick-trail-oxford).  I think my reply is relevant here too - 

&gt;I'm a firm believer in getting what you really want, are you going to regret not having these shoes or are you going to regret not having had that extra $10/week?

As always

**I.  Sneakers**
In general, you've got a lot more leeway here.

 * *Canvas sneakers/plimsolls* - Very simple footwear that's more appropriate for spring/summer than fall/winter (although that depends on where you live, tan and gray are the most versatile.  Vans, Chuck Taylors, Jack Purcells and Keds are the easiest to find, but less common brands like SeaVees, Spring Court, Superga, Tretorn and Feiyue are worth hunting down if you want something more unique. 

 * *Low-top athletic shoes* - This is a tough category, but you also can't go wrong with simple Nikes, [New Balance 574s](http://tinyurl.com/6ownyk2), Onitsuka Tigers, or Sambas.  At the high end, [Common Projects](http://tinyurl.com/dbxz49) and [MMM GATs](http://i.imgur.com/7R1CM.jpg) are fantastic, but if you know what those are

 * *High-tops* - Out of all the sneaker categories, but that's really a different style than most people associate with high-tops.)  I'm also a fan of the mid-top hikers that New Balance has been doing the last couple years ([J.Crew pairs her](http://aheadlongdive.com/2012/02/02/new-balance-for-j-crew-h710-rainier-hiker-boots/)e, [classic gray](http://i.imgur.com/rjgmI.jpg)).  There's an entire sneakerhead culture built around Dunks,  Raf and RO, and this intro guide isn't meant for any of that.  Check out [Kicksonfire](http://www.kicksonfire.com/), [slamxhype](http://slamxhype.com/tag/sneakers/), [hypebeast](http://hypebeast.com/tags/footwear/)

 * *Avoid* - Actual running shoes and Vibram Five-fingers toe-shoes - **unless actually running!** To preempt a backlash, simple shoes that there's no reason to pay for the fashion company markup.  I'm sure someone will point out some reasonable ones, but they're the exception.  Unless you're at the beach (or CA/FL), avoid sandals.  Additionally - and I realize this is probably a controversial opinion - I'd avoid black sneakers completely, unless you already know that they fit your style.  Black isn't a versatile color, despite what most people think - it doesn't match dark indigo denim, for example, in menswear


**II.  Casual/In-between Shoes**
Lots of guys focus on sneakers for casual shoes, rolled-up chinos and shorts) but look more mature than sneakers.  Again, opt for classic styles with a history - it's harder to go wrong with something that's been around, virtually unchanged, for 75-100 years.  These'll generally cost more than sneakers, but not as much as well-made dress shoes.  In many cases, they're resoleable (like dress shoes)

 * *Loafers* - Not dress shoes - they're for *loafing*.  [Bass](http://www.zappos.com/bass-longwood-cognac) makes affordable loafers ([and has a long history with this type of shoe](http://tinyurl.com/88xqt4y)), [pinch-penny](http://i.imgur.com/c1Apb), [beefroll](http://i.imgur.com/RWqOx), [tassel](http://i.imgur.com/hMctR) and [venetian loafers](http://i.imgur.com/LNInM.jpg).  I love beefroll loafers, but that's a personal preference.

 * *Bucks* - in [white nubuck](http://tinyurl.com/85kto3j) or [tan suede](http://tinyurl.com/7rfn48w), go-to-hell chinos or shorts (sockless).  To wear white bucks the most traditional way, [you've got to go all-in preppy](http://tinyurl.com/6qnx9ft) or pick up [a seersucker suit](http://i.imgur.com/qGc76).  To use an oxymoron, white bucks are [the most traditional go-to-hell shoes](http://i.imgur.com/GNPwl.jpg).  Tan bucks are a little easier to wear, imo - they look great with jeans, for example.  [There are brighter-colored options](http://www.walkover.com/Collections), but not until you have other footwear basics covered.

 * *Desert boots/chukkas* - [Clarks Desert Boots \(CDBs\)](http://tinyurl.com/8xvgg7u) get mocked as *the* MFA-hivemind item

 * *Blucher mocs/canoe mocs/camp mocs* - A more grown-up alternative to boat shoes. These generally have a charcoal or red sole, Quoddy and Yuketen make higher-end pairs (in Maine).  I've beat the hell out of [this pair of Quoddy Canoe Mocs in chromexcel](http://i.imgur.com/swCnV.jpg) for three straight summers and they just keep looking better and better.  IMO, that's the advantage of paying for quality up front.  I'm biased, because these are my favorite casual shoes.  Here are some other photos - [Blue chromexcel Oak Streets on Simplethreads](http://tinyurl.com/8775tc8), [LL Bean](http://i.imgur.com/UhTX7), [LL Bean Signature](http://i.imgur.com/IP1Cs), [Sebago Campsides](http://i.imgur.com/HLodw)

 * *Boat shoes* - Like desert boots, recently) and shoemakers like Alden, Allen Edmonds, Quoddy and Russell Moccasin all make boat shoes.  

 * *Avoid* - Sneaker/dress shoe hybrids like the ones from Sketchers, and they're invariably worn by guys who think they're stealthily getting away with wearing sneakers when dress shoes are required.  There are so many better options for in-between shoes that there is literally no excuse to buy these.

1341075414.0,vuhd4,Simple guide to tailoring/slimming/taking in your shirt,steu4718,1165,204,150,"MFA has helped me to improve my style and the fit of my clothes considerably. Thus, but I thought I'd repost it as a top-level post

Taking in a shirt really isn't too hard to do, it does take a little practice to get perfect. Here's the basics along with some important points:

***Keep in mind that if the shoulders of your shirt are too big (i.e.

For demonstration, [we are going to replace the entire seam along the side of the shirt](http://imgur.com/Qx2J4). The existing seam is called a 'flat felled seam'. It's fairly complicated to make, and trying to 'tie into it' would never look quite right, so I'm just going to replace the whole seam with a simple straight stitch. 

First put on the shirt

For a nice slim shirt

Based on my measurements and these calculations, 19.25"", 19.0"", 20"", and 21"" starting at the button at armpit level and working down. 

Completely button your shirt, it's too lumpy). Using your tape, and starting at the armpit, mark the new width of your shirt. I basically move the tape up the shirt until the [width at the armpit seam equals the width you want](http://imgur.com/atgdP). Note that altering the shirt in the manner I describe will raise the armpits. Mark this spot on both sides of the shirt. I use tailor's chalk, or in this case a fabric marking pen, which you can pick up at Walmart for a few bucks. Once again, measure twice (notice I messed up the first time

Continue to mark the width of the shirt at each [button below the armpit](http://imgur.com/eO5kB). Keep in mind that you can always take away more fabric, the width of your shirt probably shouldn't change by more than 1"" per button, so if you have a very 'hourglass' figure, you might not want to slim the shirt too much in the thinnest areas.

Ultimately, 19.5"", 19.5"", 20"", and 21"" at the last button (which is where the shirt ends at the hip).

Now

You'll also have to slim the sleeves somewhat. Again, but I'm going to use an 8"" width. 

Place the tape measure perpendicular to the top of the sleeve and such that it crosses the bottom of the sleeve about 2 inches from the armpit. [Now measure down from the top of the sleeve to your new width and mark the sleeve at this point.](http://imgur.com/K3RRk)

Connect these markings with those at the armpit and [the seam at the end of the sleeve](http://imgur.com/nVTrp). At the end of the sleeve, but absolutely no one is going to notice.

[Here's my shirt all marked up.](http://imgur.com/GeALJ)

Time to start sewing. I [start at the armpit to make sure the armpit seams from both sides of the shirt meet perfectly](http://imgur.com/as6NB). Basically

Do this on both sides of the shirt.

Now [try your shirt on](http://imgur.com/wqca1). At this point, you can undo the stitching with a seam ripper. I could probably take another half inch out of each side, but I want to wear it as it is for a day before I take it in any more. Plus, I'll be wearing an undershirt with this shirt (since it's a little see-through), which will take up some more space.

If you're happy with the new seam, you have two options: 1. you can either sew a zigzag stitch or some other stitch that prevents fraying in the fabric to be removed (i.e., between the new seam and the old seam) as close as possible to the strait stitch or I just use [pinking shears to cut away the extra fabric](http://imgur.com/X9aXr). Pinking shears cut fabric in a zig-zag pattern to minimize fraying. I will admit that pinking shears are not an ideal way to prevent fraying, but they work well enough for me, and I'm lazy.

That should be it. [Here's my newly slimmed shirt.](http://imgur.com/wboLt)

You see [dark blue a lot](http://imgur.com/JuQJp). . . . and it might have actually been in style at one point (mid-90s?). But now it looks [bad](http://imgur.com/7cwkz). Pretty much always. Even if your suit fits well . . . take [this guy for example](http://i.imgur.com/S1f4e.jpg). He at least looks passable

What about red? [Nope. It usually doesn't work](http://imgur.com/ktUHO). I think it looks bad even when someone [as slick as Robert Downy Jr. wears it](http://imgur.com/cPXp2). (granted however, patterns, and textures to create a coherent whole. Bold solid shirts like these are overpowering and destroy the coherence of the whole, no matter what you do with the fit, the suit and the tie. It would be like putting a heavy metal guitar into a reggae song, or a trombone into a metal song.

Even if you have a [darker complexion, pastel yellow, or [pink shirt and still look quite good](http://i.imgur.com/EEvWR.jpg). The key is just to have something to break up that wall of color.

And even when the shirt and the suit [fit well and are worn with a trendier cut and pattern

The [black shirt is something you see sometimes too](http://imgur.com/GAKGF), limited to night clubs and dinner parties.

And then... there's [this color...Brown? Burnt orange?](http://imgur.com/qeffu). Avoid at all costs! 

Lighter solids and gentler colors can work well. For instance [light blue](http://imgur.com/if8u6) is always a safe

Finally, although go to far, and you will be in trouble like [this guy is](http://i.imgur.com/NdWXp.jpg). it's a slippery slope here, because if you go too dark, even with pink, then you get hot pink or a weird salmon, which creates [the same problem that you have with the colors above](http://i.imgur.com/xj9ZS.jpg).

Also, that even he probably realizes he's [treading in precarious territory](http://i.imgur.com/87Xwi.jpg), but somehow, he pulls it off. I can't tell you how he makes it work, but he does. Maybe everything just works better when you have three superbowl rings to accessorize.

Bold colors have their place and can look great--but if you are wearing a suit, and it will look much better](http://i.imgur.com/iqjcZ.jpg). Here's another example of how putting a hot color in a pattern, rather than the whole shirt, subdues it a little bit and makes the [outfit look great](http://i.imgur.com/uPhGn.jpg) (note that this guy's tie and suit are saved from being too monochromatic by the flash of color in his tie tack and pocket square!).


TL;DR: Don't wear a dress shirt that is a bold solid color. If you are going to go solid

**edit** people have correctly pointed out that this post is more about wearing a bold-colored-solid shirt with a suit and tie rather than wearing it casually. And indeed, or if his outfit actually looks good). Indeed, a bright red shirt can be iconic, for example, on [Michael Jackson](http://i.imgur.com/NpUuU.jpg). But the odds are that this only looks good because Michael Jackson is wearing it, and it's part of his signature look.His son, Prince, Michael Jackson also had a Jheri curl. You should probably not have a Jheri curl. 

Similarly

Most of us will probably fail if we try to pull this off. For 90% of us, and a tie bar, [the shirt will still look cheap and dated](http://i.imgur.com/d4pLZ.jpg). This is just my opinion, but I thin it is a good general rule, and at the very least, you won't look bad!

**edit 2**: LeBron James's shirt might actually be white. I really can't tell.

It looks like the inseam is 8-9"" (depending on the waist size), which should hit a hair above the knee for most folks - short enough to be in style, but not so short that you'd feel self-conscious (not that you *should* feel self-conscious showing a few extra inches of leg, but I digress).  For colors, I'd get two of the versatile basics (British khaki, stone, bright blue and red as alternatives.

The catch is that you have to wait 4-6 weeks to get them, but since a lot of the US is still digging out of the snow, I suspect that's not a problem.  [The fit chart on their website is vague](http://z-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/314uSHizPDL.html), but from what I've read, these fit reasonably slim and long, much like American Apparel.

The first ever catalog was shipped in 1983, President and creative director; Millard Drexler, who was the CEO of GAP from the 90's until 2002 (often credited with GAP's unbelievable rise in popularity in the 90's); and, perhaps most important for us, Frank Muytjens, head of the Men's Design at J. Crew.

Frank Muytjens is probably the reason why J. Crew is so appealing to many of us in this community today. For those that don't know, which I promise I'll delve into much further detail later. He's also solely responsible for many of J. Crew's collaborations, which I'm sure many of you have seen, including Alden, Crockett &amp; Jones, Sperry, Ray-ban, and many more iconic brands. In addition

**Why J. Crew?**  
So you might be asking, J. Crew offers good-quality basics that last at a semi-reasonable price point (more on that later). In addition, J. Crew draws from the history of clothing more than many brands of its caliber. This is evident in its Thomas Mason line of shirting, it's 60's and 80's inspired suiting, and revitalization of other classics, in everything from outerwear to socks. Personally, I feel that J. Crew's attention to detail is really what separates it from say, or Uniqlo. In addition

Now let's talk about what you can buy from J. Crew

**Pricing**
Before we do that though, feel that J. Crew is too expensive. I personally agree. If you buy J. Crew at full retail, chances are that you would be better off buying somewhere else, with a few exceptions. However, J. Crew regularly has 30-40% off sale items, and the occasional 30-40% off all items in store. Also, if you sign up for their, although I'm not 100% sure). J. Crew also has the oft-mentioned 15% student discount. Just show your student ID and provide a valid college email in store and you will receive 15% off your purchase. This does not work online. If you are not a student/teacher

If you decide to work at J. Crew (I have no experience with this), but it's a definite perk of working there.

**T-shirts**
Let's start with the basics. J. Crew currently offers basically every variation of the basic T-shirt that you can think of. [Crew neck]( http://www.jcrew.com/mens_category/polostees/brokeninjerseytees/PRDOVR~10132/10132.jsp)/[V neck]( http://www.jcrew.com/mens_category/polostees/brokeninjerseytees/PRDOVR~15773/15773.jsp)/[pocket tee]( http://www.jcrew.com/mens_category/polostees/brokeninjerseytees/PRDOVR~31270/31270.jsp)/[color block]( http://www.jcrew.com/mens_category/polostees/indigo/PRDOVR~99047/99047.jsp)/[nautical stripe]( http://www.jcrew.com/mens_category/polostees/graphicandstripetees/PRDOVR~33332/33332.jsp) are just some of the options. If you can think of it

**Polos/Henleys**
I lumped these together because I have limited experience with Henleys and I really didn’t want to make it its own section. However, but are logoless, which I prefer. The [slim fit](http://www.jcrew.com/mens_category/polostees/shortsleevepolos/PRDOVR~93952/93952.jsp) makes for a great spring/summer classic and they have a variety of colors to choose from. The one linked is in pique, but they offer a regular broken-in variety as well. I recommend the oft-mentioned navy and white as a starting point. Be wary of the way the long-sleeve polos fit in the arms, as they are pretty slim. J. Crew’s henleys, which make great layering pieces, are also available in a wide variety. However, I can’t say much about it

**Sweaters/Hoodies**
Personally, fit extremely well and are excellent quality. I personally own several cotton and merino wool sweaters, along with one cotton-cashmere sweaters and they are all extremely durable and look fantastic with OCBD’s under them. I would avoid their all-cashmere sweaters mostly because Club Monaco offers better ones at a cheaper price point. You can find the styles that J. Crew sells [here](http://www.jcrew.com/mens_category/sweaters.jsp). I don't like J. Crew hoodies that much. There are much better alternatives at that price range. Avoid unless on sale.

**Shirts**
Honestly, [Ludlow Dress Shirt]( http://www.jcrew.com/mens_category/shirts/ludlowdressshirts.jsp), [Chambray + denim]( http://www.jcrew.com/mens_category/shirts/workshirts.jsp), and of course their [Thomas Mason Line]( http://www.jcrew.com/mens_category/shirts/thomasmasonfshirts.jsp). 

Their Thomas Mason line was inspired by Thomas Mason, which collaborates with J. Crew. To view a video about this fascinating collaboration, you can view videos, including [this]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJNGrF3eMqA)
For anyone new to J. Crew

**Pants**
J. Crew offers a variety of pant cuts as well. The most popular being their new 484 fit (similar to Dockers Alphas
At the price range of the 484 jeans
The Bowery pant is perfect for wearing to work
Chinos are where J. Crew shines
Also, and are the best pair of cords I’ve ever worn.

**Suiting**
When talking about J. Crew suiting, cashmere, linen, etc), the Ludlow Suit is possibly the best suit you can buy at its price point. There’s a reason it took J. Crew from having a mediocre menswear selection to having one of the most famous.  The cut is fantastic, featuring high notch lapels and a 2.5” lapel width. They look great with skinny ties and I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a great suit. 
Also

**Shorts**
This is also one of J.Crew’s best-selling points. They offer 6 cuts: Club, Broken-in chinos, Essential, and Utility. Personally, I’d recommend the Stanton (very basic, a bit wider in the leg) and Club (lower rise, tighter in thigh). Also, check out the Essential cut. I’m pretty sure that all of these are offered at 7

**Outerwear**
I’ll be honest: I’m not impressed with J. Crew’s outerwear. Although I own two different styles, I’d find something cheaper from a more reputable outerwear company. I’ve heard that their University Coat is decent, but having never worn it myself, I can’t be sure of that).

**Accessories/bags**

J. Crew actually has some pretty cool accessories and bags, and [Abingdon Messenger Bag]( http://www.jcrew.com/mens_category/accessories/bags/PRDOVR~51657/51657.jsp) (Fantastic, by the way), and other miscellaneous items.

**Collaborations**
In general, there are a few to watch out for that are fantastic. Of course, there’s the [Killshot II]( http://www.jcrew.com/mens_category/shoes/sneakers/PRDOVR~85231/99102715357/ENE~1+2+3+22+4294967294+20~~~0~15~all~mode+matchallany~~~~~killshot/85231.jsp), (J. Crew x Nike) as well as their Sperry Collaborations. There’s the Alden collection as well, which is worth taking a look at if you have a lot of money to blow. Other than that, I would avoid most collaborations, especially their notebooks (wtf), backpacks

**Conclusion:**

I may go ahead and post some more information regarding things that I decided were less important at a later time. Also, J. Crew Factory is of much less quality than J. Crew, but there are a few gems among the rest of the shit that it produces. At a 40% + 15% student discount, however, it can be some of the most affordable and stylish clothing that you can get. If you have any comments of things I should add/delete/reorganize, feel free to mention them below and I’ll make any additions I feel are necessary.

**Tl;dr** J. Crew is awesome

EDIT 1: Wallace and Barnes is the line by J. Crew that is inspired by American Workwear. I find that these pieces are actually pretty nice, I would consider other brands.

**A Note on J. Crew Factory**

J. Crew factory offers many similar items to J. Crew, most of J. Crew Factory's stock is 30-40% off. The washed shirts are great for that price (~$25). STAY AWAY from accessories (ties,etc). They wear out insanely quickly. I view J. Crew Factory as an alternative to Old Navy in terms of quality, but their styles are much more modern and sophisticated. Stay away from graphic tees/polos as well. There are a few gems, but be careful when shopping there. Almost ALL J. Crew factory items will have two diamonds on the tag, indicated that they are part of the offshoot brand. ",,self,,

&gt;The common analogy (itself almost mnemonic) compares dressing well to any other form of art – music, rhythm or keys and just hammering away at the strings with a bunch of effects pedals switched on may be fun but will rarely lead to great development or the ability to express anything personal or honest. John Cage didn’t simply stick a bunch of spoons inside a piano and compose avant-garde masterpieces – his prepared piano pieces were an organic development out of years of studying, performing, experimenting and the influence of Indian musical forms and philosophy.

&gt; * Go to many fashion forums, people-watch and generally seek various sources of info in a not-so discriminating way. If you don't know exactly what you need it makes sense to say you're not set on where it is. Sadly, a negative externality of this approach is that might include sending some money to Condé Nast unless you can find ways to steal their overpriced mags.

&gt; * Go to loads of different stores and try garments on, unless you plan to live on a deserted island you'll have to deal with the all-seeing eye of the multitude.

&gt; * Get inexpensive items in various styles that interest you and experiment with different looks. H&amp;M, thrifting and ebay are your friends, and might remain so anyway.

&gt;Which is to say, buy better.” Instead, dabble around and shop in the middle-tiers of quality. That way, you don’t lose out on too much as you try to find your own sense of style. Let your tastes slowly mature, be honest with what you wear, and cull everything that doesn’t feel like a natural extension of yourself. That’s the best way, I think

Find a ton of handmade bracelets and silk pocket squares, discover your favorite pair of sunglasses, try on a pair of go-to-hell pants. Experiment with fabrics and fits, colors and patterns. Steal inspiration from each of these guys and come up with a look that’s all your own.

**[Matt Smith on the evolution of his personal style](http://wax-wane.com/2012/09/14/special-guest-post-matt-smith-on-the-evolution-of-personal-style/)**

&gt;What I learned most from them is that caring about whether a jacket is full or half-canvassed doesn’t make you stylish or better than the average, where you come from, how you see yourself, and how you want to see yourself.  It’s as much about the things that made you feel like you were cooler than everyone else in fifth grade, as it is about the things that make you happy right now.
&gt;
&gt;It’s about evolving and finding new influences and interesting ways of expressing what you love. It doesn’t matter if you can tell someone exactly how many stitches per inch their shirt has or how that amazing Neapolitan shoulder was made. That doesn’t make you more stylish, and let me tell you that’s much more important.

**[Finally

&gt;[A unique item of clothing, or novelty tie] is not an extension of his personality or natural in any way, it is a clumsy (yet understandable) attempt to graft a personality onto himself much like a facade. He has a preconceived notion about what personality such an item has and may confer, and is hoping to have this external presentation magically alter and define his actual personality.
&gt;
&gt;These are often the actions of one who is insecure about themselves and lacking confidence about who they are and their personality.

Most photos posted to MFA fall into two categories: ""fit check"" and ""show off.""

**General Tips:**

* **Good lighting is the most important thing for any photo.** Without good lighting
* Make sure you're not back lit. Light should be coming from an angle in front of you (e.g.
* If you're having trouble getting good light inside open every shade and turn on every light.
* Use the on-camera flash as a last resort. It gives a lot of light at the cost of flattening everything out. Also
* Clean your camera lens. If you're using your bathroom mirror
* A good camera/lens helps a lot


Here are two pictures taken with the same camera

* [Handheld through a mirror with typical household lighting
* [Using a tripod with lots of natural light coming from the side.](http://i.imgur.com/yTRkJ.jpg) 

**Fit Check:**

This is for when you're looking for input on how an outfit fits/looks. The most important thing is to give people a clear

* **Keep your hands out of your pockets!** Leave them both relaxed at your sides (or one if the other hand is holding the camera). 
* [Stand in a straight
* If possible
* Show the whole outfit including shoes
* Ideally
* For god's sake don't post a picture that needs to be rotated 90 degrees.
* If you're holding the camera
* People aren't used to seeing outfits from waist level. Position the camera at least chest high
* If your clothes are dark
* If it's a suit or jacket

**Show-off:**

This is for cases where you're not really looking for a fit check

* Lighting is still the most important thing. If you're outside
* Try different poses. It's okay to put your hand in your pocket or stand in 3/4 profile if you're not getting a fit check. 
* Use a tripod and timer/remote. It makes it much easier to get a whole outfit shot and eliminates blurriness caused by unsteady hands.
* Avoid distracting backgrounds. 
* If your camera has manual controls, for less motion blur.
* Have fun. Feel free to be creative. Don't take this too seriously.

This went on for awhile until, naturally, I started getting burnt out. My critiques became more caustic, my patience for helping new comers was wearing thin, and I found myself just being a complete dick to people who just wanted a little help dressing better. Not who I wanted to be.

So I decided to step down as moderator and take a break from MFA. Fast forward a year later and here we are. Looking through this album I see that I'm all over the place when it comes to style. It varies from contemporary menswear to post apocalyptic goth ninja shit. I think it's important to note that I always try to dress for the context of a situation. I still find myself wearing basic menswear stuff for business meetings

I feel like now I have a better understanding of my style. Instead of ""dressing up for the internet"", I think. I'm not the greatest dresser still, but that's ok. I don't get worked up anymore because I see someone wearing bad shoes. People are just at different stages in their life and, who knows, fashion might not even be a priority for them. It's stupid to judge people on looks alone.

MFA has always been a great community because it's so incredibly approachable. I am so grateful looking back and appreciate the fact that you guys put up with all my shit fits, but MFA has changed my life. I've made a bunch of friends on here and still feel connected to the community even though I don't participate that much anymore.

I'm just ranting at this point

1367786618.0,1dr04d,Spring/Summer Guide to Nightclub Wear,Billy_Brubaker,1250,391,340,"I've been wanting to make a guide for a while now.  I noticed that every once in a while we get nightclub wear questions so I figured I'd make a guide.  I'm going to keep things on the trashier side of the spectrum

Ok

I'm not saying you should overdress

Emphasizing a good silhouette is very important because it's going to be dark; nobody will be able to see the exact details of what you're wearing

Let's get specific:

**Pants:**

I like to wear jeans, [Levi's 513's](http://us.levi.com/product/index.jsp?productId=11694071&amp;&amp;cp=3146842.3146854.11326986) or [511's](http://us.levi.com/product/index.jsp?productId=11628403&amp;&amp;cp=3146842.3146854.3691990) are going to be your best bet, which style is dependent on your build.  They're both slim fitting, yet not overly so.  If you have larger calves go with the 513's as they give you a little extra room.  I would stay away from 514's as they have a large leg opening which will create a poor silhouette and give off a bootcut/bell bottom look.  

Some of you might be asking, leave the raws at home.  I've made that mistake and it sucks.

Chinos are also OK.  Just keep it dark

**Shirt:** 

I'd go with a [button down](http://www.brooksbrothers.com/White-Wash-Shirt/MG00846, size down.  As I said before, silhouette is very important.  If the sleeves are too small, you're going to be rolling them anyway.  If it's a bit shorter then you would've liked, that's fine shorter is better then longer IMO when you're going untucked.  [Here's a good pic showing length dfference](http://i.imgur.com/CpFXMLW.jpg).  Even if the guy with the well fitting shirt had an inch less of fabric it's be passable.  If it's pulling a little in the chest, nobody's going to notice when you're out there out there dancing anyway.

Note 1- Don't be afraid to unbutton your shirt two (three is probably too much but it varies by shirt) buttons.  You want to look like your comfortable and not stuffy and unapproachable.  You're at a trashy nightclub

Note 2- Plaid.  There's going to be a lot of plaid

Don't wear a [tshirt](http://i.imgur.com/zcgxUqC.jpg).  You might get turned away at the door and it looks shitty.  I'd also stay away from polos as they look off at a nightclub in my opinion.  It looks like you wanted to wear a t-shirt but needed something with a collar.

**Intermission:**

You might be saying,default,pd.html)  with the pattern as long as it fits well and you're wearing the clothes and not letting the clothes wear you.  This gets back to the silhouette thing again, 90% of the guys there will be wearing this but with shitty fits.  You don't want to stand out through [dressing different](http://i.imgur.com/YaIwsFa.jpg), you want to stand out by having the best fitting clothes there.  Don't get me wrong, peacock a little but don't go overboard; for example avoid plaid as stated above.

**Shoes:**

Like I said before

However, the leather sole gets really slippery if the floor is somewhat wet from a spilt drink.  When you're a bit tipsy it's really easy to fall down some stairs if you're not paying attention.

I'd get a nice low profile brown leather shoe that fit's into your budget that you don't mind trashing.  I have a pair of [Nordstrom 1901's](http://shop.nordstrom.com/s/1901-casey-longwing-derby/3289052?origin=category-personalizedsort&amp;contextualcategoryid=0&amp;fashionColor=&amp;resultback=300&amp;cm_sp=personalizedsort-_-browseresults-_-1_2_B) that I wear for this reason.  They're decent looking

Upping your budget to $200

On the topic of AE

**Underwear:**

[Uniqlo low rise briefs](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/store/lifewear/men-airism-low-rise-boxer-briefs/076561-61-005?ref=mens-clothing%2Fmens-underwear-and-loungewear%2Fmens-underwear).  They won't bunch up under your pants and will make your junk look great for when you're showing it off to whoever you met in the club that night.

**Undershirt:**

[2-Xist deep V](http://shop.2xist.com/product/X1041/).  Unless you don't sweat

**Socks:**

Anything but [white athletic socks.](http://i.imgur.com/0dLdEIw.jpg)  Get a crazy pair if you're into that

**Accessories:**

I highly recommend wearing a watch to the club as it is much less obnoxious than pulling out your cell phone to check the time.  You can't go wrong with the MFA favorite, offers excellent lume and is almost impossible to lose thanks to the nato strap.  Watches also provide a nice feel when you're [getting your fist pump on.](http://i.imgur.com/79nq7HG.gif)

Don't wear a hat.

Wear a belt.

Ties are a bit tougher to incorporate.  As it's a spring/summer guide I didn't touch upon layering at all.  IMO

**Enfin:**

As you gathered

[Here's an inspiration album](http://imgur.com/a/Utrcq) to give an idea of what I mean by casual

I'm about to list some general guidelines but incorporating a blazer into a casual outfit still kind of falls into a grey area of subjective taste where the main rule to follow is ""don't look like an idiot"". Unfortunately

That being said

* Avoid blazers with lots of structure and shoulder padding. Soft shoulders and unstructured blazers have a ""softer"" appearance. The lines are a little less clean and neat

* Avoid worsted wools and odd suit jackets. For one, tweed, cotton, or washed cotton.

* Avoid wool pants. Most wool pants are dress pants and induce thoughts of business casual, or shorts if you're feeling next level.

* Avoid collared shirts. The main reason I say this is because an untucked shirt looks more casual than a tucked shirt, low cut v-neck, or scoop neck shirt or sweater. [Crew necks](http://i.imgur.com/HKQPI5O.png) can work, but are not ideal in my opinion. I also think that 99% of graphic tees look horrible underneath blazers, but there are exceptions.

* Avoid dress shoes. Opt for more casual shoes like desert boots, nice clean sneakers, etc. Sneakers can be a bit tricky, I would avoid anything that looks beat up or sporty like New Balance or Nike Airs and go for something more clean and minimal like Vans, Chucks, or sigh...Common Projects.

These are all just different ways to make your outfit more casual

**Edit:** I guess I should have given the standard inspiration album disclaimer. It's just for inspiration and to present a certain type of aesthetic. You're not expected to like every photo. I personally find it much more productive to look at these things and pick out the things you like and might want to incorporate into your style rather than focus on the things you don't like.",self,t5_2r65t,1360910354.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/18ijce/how_to_dress_down_a_blazer/

**Navy Jackets - [Album](http://imgur.com/a/GqjqC)**

The classic for a reason. Terribly versatile colour that provides the foundation for all manner of outfits.

Combines well with:

* **Charcoal** - a classic British public school look. Risks looking safe but boring unless the fit and details are more modern.

* **Med/Light Grey**

* **Khaki** - An American business staple.

* **White** - A summery

* **Brown**

---

**Blue Jackets - [Album](http://imgur.com/a/SGti4)**

A much more uncommon and vibrant colour for jackets

Looks good with:

* **White** - perfect *#menswear* summer look.

* **Khaki**

* **Grey** - Lighter greys work better in my opinion

* **Other blues** - Depending on the shade of the jacket - there should be a clear contrast between the two. Navy looks great under a light blue jacket.

---

**Grey/Charcoal Jackets - [Album](http://imgur.com/a/zdhRE)**

Contrary to instinct grey and especially charcoal solid colour single jackets are some of the least versatile choices of the lot. A very commonly seen colour but often very poorly used and understood. Its lack of colour limit it mostly to other shades within the white-grey-charcoal spectrum. Khaki works ok too. In general

Works with:

* **Other Greys**: Charcoal for grey jackets

* **White/Cream**: One of the better combinations available - spring/summer only. Pay close attention to the shades involved - lighter greys are much more preferable. Charcoal is too much.

* **Khaki** - Not especially exciting

A grey jacket on navy or brown trousers is pretty dire

---

**Brown Jackets - [Album](http://imgur.com/a/cxwlm)**

A somewhat under-appreciated colour

* **Charcoal/Grey**

* **White** - Can be very crisp

* **Olive** - A bolder

* **Other shades of brown** - tricky to do well

---

**Khaki/Tan/Beige Jackets - [Album](http://imgur.com/a/dgKAu)**

Another colour much more suited to the summer

Works well with:

* **White/Cream** - I think cream is nicer with tan personally.

* **Grey/Charcoal** - Lighter greys go great for a more subdued look. Charcoal can work well too

* **Brown** - darker than the tan of the jackets. Can risk looking stuffy depending on the cut and the style (see Bond)

* **Olive** and other pastels for a bolder approach

---

**Olive/Greens Jackets - [Album](http://imgur.com/a/ItOBI)**

The most underrated colour for a autumn/winter sports jacket in my opinion

* **Grey/Charcoal**

* **Khaki/Beige**

* **Browns** - an earthy combination

---

**Black Jackets/Black Trousers**

First off, you'll want to have [contrast](http://i.imgur.com/hQZYU6o.jpg) between your clothes and your bag, though it's also possible to try for a [monochrome](http://i.imgur.com/VEbYs5d.jpg) look.

Typically, like grey, navy, charcoal, burgundy and black. If you're getting a leather bag, most shades of brown will work well, depending on your wardrobe.

However, understand that it might not work as well with your wardrobe. Furthermore, if it's a loud backpack, be wary of wearing it often: the novelty will wear off, and it will eventually come off as ""tacky"" to people that see it too often.

* What will I use it for?

Use common sense. Choose a bag that suits your needs, nor is it a good idea to wear a backpack with a suit/blazer.

Similarly, while staying at a manageable weight. Saddleback bags, for instance, can get pretty heavy. Be sure to take into account whether you'll need to carry your bag around all day or whether you just need it for the commute to work.

**Types of Bags:**

---

**Backpacks:** 

For high school and college students, and they'll have room to carry your books, a laptop, and whatever else you might need. Even if you aren't a student anymore, backpacks are still versatile and pretty useful for commuting and travel, especially for day trips to the city. Don't worry about looking juvenile, as there are a variety of styles to choose from, though it is true that [some backpacks](http://i.imgur.com/lU2620W.jpg) give off a more youthful vibe than others.

**Canvas backpacks** work well with more classic types of styles, prep, and bizcaz styles. For beginners, I would recommend buying a canvas backpack. They are more versatile, as they work well among the pieces of the basic wardrobe. Check out this [visual compilation](http://i.imgur.com/FVh4meL.jpg) of [classic canvas backpacks](http://redd.it/1jf86y/) for a couple of possibilities to consider. If you happen to like a certain backpack, but it's out of your price range, I'd recommend looking into the brand for similar and possibly cheaper options.

On the other hand, I'd recommend this style of backpack. While some of these bags may not be as versatile in general, they can still work well among a variety of outfits within the streetwear/techwear style. Plus, some of them are pretty fucking cool. Black is a popular color, as that backpack color works particularly well in monochrome fits, and it contrasts nicely with most tops/jackets. /u/rjbman did a great [compilation](http://i.imgur.com/xCbQOlN.jpg) of [urban backpacks](http://redd.it/1jqlm7/) for your consideration.

**Messenger bags:** 

Messenger bags serve the same role as backpacks do, cardigans, OCBDs + jeans/chinos often, this might be the right style of bag for you. The two major options to choose between are leather messengers and canvas messenger bags.

**Canvas messengers** are a more casual option and are better suited for class/travel than the workplace, as /u/kerodean shows [here](http://redd.it/wxa0m/).

Closely related are the **""technical"" messenger bags**, as most of their offerings simply aren't fashionable in terms of aesthetic design and in outfit versatility. This is neither a blanket ban on timbuk2, nor is it a set-in-stone rule. Feel free to ignore it, but you do so at your own risk!

**Leather messengers** are the more formal option, you should look for ""full-grain"" or ""top-grain"" leather goods, as opposed to ""genuine leather"". This is because genuine leather is actually pretty crappy leather, and won't age well compared to the higher quality leathers. However, the drawback to requiring higher quality is the higher price. Also be sure to pay careful attention to the weight of the bag - leather bags can be heavy.

If you're interested in looking for a messenger bag of your own

---

**Briefcases/Carpenter Bags:** 

Briefcases and carpenter bags are really more suited for the workplace and travel, really require at least a business casual level of formality, and they look fantastic when worn with a suit. As for canvas briefcases and carpenter bags, they aren't quite as formal, but you should at least be wearing dark wash denim and a buttondown to match the level of formality.

If you're in the market for a **leather briefcase**, full-grain leather is higher quality, more durable, and will age well - check out how [this Saddleback briefcase](http://i.imgur.com/oD7fnB2.jpg) has aged, for instance. Don't cheap out on something that you'll be carrying around for years!

For more awesome briefcase pics

---

**Weekenders/Duffel Bags:** 

Weekenders and duffel bags are different from the other types of bags in the sense that you shouldn't be carrying them around daily. Weekenders, and they're handy for carrying a bunch of stuff, like your gym apparel. But while they might not be carried around as often, it's never a bad idea to travel in style. Most options come in canvas or leather, though I personally prefer canvas as they'll be lighter and therefore easier to carry. 

If you'd like to see more weekender bags to choose from

----

**Other Types of Bags**

**Tote Bags** could be a useful option if you need to tote a bunch of stuff around

**Drawstring Bags** are also a more functional kind of bag, don't expect it to be fashionable - most of them are made out of cheap nylon, and tend to be worn by high school seniors with senioritis.

*****
I’ve been seeing a metric fuckton of posts about dressing college students, so here it is an updated guide.  

This guide applies to **all** ages, or self-perceived personal archetypes.  This guide just lists the absolute **BASICS** and will point to some budget-minded options for this.  Yes, I know about other articles of clothing like chinos and cords, but this guide is for the noobs.  Read this guide understanding that a lot of noobs can't afford $150 Gitman shirts, or $300 for sick Ervell knits.  Remember though, generally, you get what you pay for.

Before you say this guide isn’t for me I’m in middle school, graduate school, fucking read the guide. 

Side note: **Fit is fucking king**, nothing can make expensive clothes look like shit like a bad fit.  Tagged clothing size varies widely by manufacturer, a small isn't always a small and a large might be a medium.

**SECTION I – THE BLUE JEAN**
*****
The mother fucking blue jean

* [**Levi’s 511** – Clean Dark - $39.99]( http://www.amazon.com/Levis-Young-Mens-Skinny-32x32/dp/B001O29NL0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1314943197&amp;sr=8-1) – Slim fitting
* [**Levi’s 514** – Tumbled Rigid -$ 37.99](http://www.amazon.com/Levis-Straight-Dirty-Rigid-36x30/dp/B002DUTKP6/ref=sr_1_1?s=apparel&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1314943345&amp;sr=1-1) – Slimmer than you’re used to
* [**Levi’s 501** – Clean Rigid - $42.99](http://www.amazon.com/Levis-Mens-Original-Stonewash-36x32/dp/B0018ON49G/ref=sr_1_1?s=apparel&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1314943420&amp;sr=1-1) – A cornerstone of fucking Americana

**SECTION II – THE SHIRT**
*****
Someone said that a shirt’s collar frames the face, maybe some solid colors here and there.  Graphic tees you ask?  Wear them at your own risk, you’re probably half as cool as you think and when you wear a graphic tee you look a third as cool as half you think.

* [**Mossimo V-Neck Tees** - $7.99]( http://www.target.com/p/Mossi-Men-s-Ss-Tee-Lauren-Blue/-/A-13312417) – Multiple colors – you can find these at target
There are however other shirts available too, I’m too young for that.”  I say, “Bullshit asshole, nobody likes the tuna here, unless you’re still swimming in your mom’s womb, you’re old enough to wear collared button downs.
* [**Mossimo Polos** - $9.99]( http://www.target.com/p/Mossimo-174-Polo-Jetstream-Blue/-/A-13184953) – Multiple colors, these ones from target are easy.

**Button Ups** – Stick with long sleeved versions for now, thicker and heavier weaves are more casual (oxford and twill) and lighter weaves more formal (poplin and broadcloth).  There are exceptions to these rules, but this is just a guideline

* [**Lands End Canvas**]( http://canvas.landsend.com/ix/canvas/Canvas/Sale/Men/Tops/Shirts/index.html?seq=1~2~3~4~5~6&amp;catNumbers=2198~2471~2509~2516~2799&amp;visible=1~1~1~1~1~1&amp;store=le&amp;sort=Price%3A+low+to+high&amp;pageSize=72&amp;tab=17) – They have sales on all the time
* **Alfani Red** [**“Dress Shirts”** - $20-$30]( http://www1.macys.com/search/results.ognc?sortOption=*&amp;Keyword=alfani%20red&amp;resultsPerPage=24&amp;Action=sd&amp;attrs=Department:Department:Dress+Shirt) - [**“Sport Shirts”** - $20-$30]( http://www1.macys.com/search/results.ognc?sortOption=*&amp;Keyword=alfani%20red&amp;resultsPerPage=24&amp;Action=sd&amp;attrs=Department:Department:Shirts) – These are decent slim shirts on a budget

**SECTION II – THE LAYERS**
*****
Like Ned Stark loves to say, blazers and trenches for the heavy hitters.

* [**Merona V-Neck** - $22.99]( http://www.target.com/s?searchTerm=merona+sweater&amp;category=9976707|All|matchallany|men) – Here I am again, crew necks are pretty awesome too.
* [**LEC Sweaters, Mr. Rogers, Jimmy Carter, manly as fuck.
* [**American Apparel Cardigans** - $22]( http://www.ebay.com/itm/RSA4400-American-Apparel-Baby-Rib-Cardigan-ANY-COLOR-SZ-/130509800228?pt=US_CSA_MC_Sweaters&amp;var=&amp;hash=item641f289865) – Simple and basic
* [**American Apparel Hoodies** - $30]( http://www.ebay.com/itm/F497-American-Apparel-Flex-Fleece-Zip-HOODY-ANY-CLR-SZ-/130498180989?pt=US_Mens_Sweats_Hoodies&amp;var=&amp;hash=item641f113bb0) – These are raw as fuck.  Some people may say hoodies are immature

**SECTION IV – THE SHOES**
*****
Ah shoes, some flip flops and some bulky ass dress shoes.  Shoes are great, however shoes are kinda fucking expensive, so I’m only going over some cheap basics.

* **Canvas Sneakers** -  [**Converse Chuck Taylor All Star** - $45]( http://www.zappos.com/converse-chuck-taylor-all-star-core-ox-optical-white) - [**Vans Authentic** - $45]( http://www.zappos.com/vans-authentic-core-classics-true-white) – These are basic ass low-top canvas sneakers
* **Boat Shoes** - [**Sperry Authentic Originals** - $75](http://www.zappos.com/sperry-top-sider-authentic-original-classic-brown) – Boat shoes, $75 at Zappos.
* **Desert Fucking Boots** - [**Clarks** $60-80]( http://www.amazon.com/Clarks-Originals-Mens-Desert-Oakwood/dp/B0031Y6UXI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1314947190&amp;sr=8-1) – These are fucking parroted left and right here and I’ll recommend them again.  The **Beeswax** are inoffensive looking chukka boots at a reasonable price.  They go well with jeans and chinos. 

**SECTION V – ACCESSORIES**
*****
Accessories, but leave that to the pros.  Two basic accessories that can work for any man are a belt and a watch.

* [**The Timex Weekender** - $40]( http://www.timex.com/s?searchKeywords=timex+weekender+slip&amp;Action=submit) – Ah, with a lot of options for being you in the strap.  Just please don’t post a picture of it when you get one.  Black faces are more casual than white watch faces.
* [**4 STR / 4 STA Leather Belt** - $35]( http://stores.ebay.com/Orion-Leather/Leather-Belts-/_i.html?_fsub=1091149014&amp;_sid=174214354&amp;_trksid=p4634.c0.m322) – I got a decent leather belt from this store on ebay.  The wider the belt the more casual, try to match the color with your belt.

**CLOSING THOUGHTS**
*****
Here are a few brick and mortar/mall stores which you can easily find some reasonably priced basics in person.
* [H&amp;M](http://www.hm.com) - Cheap
* [Zara](http://www.zara.com) - Cheap
* [Uniqlo](http://www.uniqlo.com) - Only available in New York

That’s it for now.  These are just some basics, the initial cost of dressing better might be a lot, but there’s a high return on investment here.  Dressing well gives you confidence and with confidence, the world is your fucking oyster.  If people like this guide, I’ll follow up with some additional information and perhaps an intermediate guide.

If you don’t take anything else away from this guide

DISCLAIMER: This 'guide' is **my opinion** and if you disagree with me
****
In general
Until about 3 months ago

**Reasons for wearing graphic tees.**

The main reason for wearing graphic tees should **visual appeal** and **positive association**. By positive association I mean that you feel strongly about what company/band etc. you are representing and that you are proud to show this affection. If a shirt is just 'funny' then it probably isn't anything else and it isn't worth getting.

Personally, I would be proud to show my support towards him but there is no visual appeal for me. 

Overt branding can also put me off. [This shirt](http://clammyclams.com/images/white_close.jpg) is really nice from the front due to multiple reason. Firstly I like the look – good contrast, it doesn't just apply to one niche group of people. 
The back ruins it for me though. The tee has now lost it's subtly. The obvious 'Clams Casino' writing is very off putting for me. This shirt would now only be used in combination with a shirt like so. I wouldn't want to wear it without something covering the back.

Subtle branding can be quite cool
This shirt is one of my all time favourites, LuckyMe, is done in a way that doesn't make it immediately obvious and so, visually appealing. Of course, if you don't love LuckyMe, this shirt loses some appeal. The shirt is perfect for me as I am very proud to support this collective. 
****
***The 3 main types of graphic tees.***
****
* *The one with the stupid pun/saying or overt branding - The worst.*

This is tee should be avoided at all times

 
* *Arty Graphics. - Usually best worn on their own.*
 
These should not be combined with other tops

I would like to single out [this one](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0074/1102/products/bucky_grande.jpg?317) as it is an interesting one, but IMO the block of yellow makes this less cluttered than if it was all B&amp;W.
 
* *Simple graphics. - Easily combined
 
These will often have very prominent graphics
 
These are my favourite

****
I would like to look at [this picture](http://i.imgur.com/9v9hFWq.jpg) in depth for a moment. I think this is one of the best ways to pull off a graphic tee. He has matched the colour of the print with the colour of his shoes (this **does not** always go well. Can only recommend with fairly subtle colours like grayscale
(EDIT: I only just found out this is /u/letigreletigre

 I know this is meant to be a 'guide' on graphic tees
****

***Noteworthy***

* As with all clothing

* Quality is very important..how does the shirt feel and look after one or two washes? A good shirt will break in well and its print will stay strong.

* Wearing graphic tees doesn't mean you can be sloppy with an outift. They should still fit in with the outfit colour-wise. I believe this why people often slate graphic tees

Thanks for the support guys. I'm building the app. I will post in this subreddit the website

-----------------------------------------------

I'm a UI designer and application developer.

The app will:

1. Detect what colors suit you (using seasonal color analysis).
2. Detect what style suits you (depending on your body type).
3. See reviews of products
4. Allow you to review products and shops/sites to buy from. You can rate the style, and materials.
5. Allow you to see recommendations on alternative/similar items of clothing.
6. Allow you to create your own inspiration list of photos of fashionable gentlemen
7. Allow you to browse
8. Allow you to read guides

The goal is that you will take the app with you when you go out to a shop. It will help you find what makes you look great.

Would you use it if I made it? I want to see if there is interest

---------
Let me preface this by saying I was super active on MFA for a good 6 months, fabric matching, etc. I realized there is a bigger picture most guys ignore:

**FITNESS.**

Now I know most of you will say, but I eat *pretty well* and I walk a lot, or commute with my bike sometimes..."" And yes, I was exactly the same way. Probably underweight if anything, ride my bike everywhere, no one has ever called me unhealthy. 

But one day I decided to use some extra tip money and join a gym. I found a very basic, NOW.

Benefits:

1) **Ridiculous increase in confidence.** I really had no issues with myself prior but watching yourself get better and better and better at lifting HEAVY amounts of weights really makes you feel like a true boss

2) **Mental Discipline.** This spills over into everything in your life. When you train yourself to get your ass into the gym when you need to, a better boyfriend, a better employee, etc. The benefits of a healthy, strong mind should be obvious.

3) **Clothes fit better.** Now this is something that I feel MFA needs to know about. I am a skinny fuck. (I was 5'7"" / 130lbs.) I bought smalls, wear size 28 jeans, etc. After I started working out, I started eating more, increasing protein, carbs, etc. (Which is fun if you like to eat!!) 

Not only am I ""filling out"" more, big forearms, biceps). For those fellow skinny guys out there you know that having clothes ""look right"" is a challenge, especially off the rack. Now, I can try shit on and there's a chance it is *too small*, which never used to happen. Now my shoulders fill out dress shirts better, my chest doesn't look as ""billowy"" in everything

4) **Style.** We always show images of our fashion heroes, as opposed to a boy dressing like a man. You're not going to pull off a Kennedy style polo shirt without some nice arms. You're not going to look like Connery with some wimpy, bad posture shoulders.

5) **You can do more shit.** This is obvious. Lift heavy shit, fix shit around the house, complete chores with greater efficiency. 

All of that leads back to the first point: Confidence. Which in fashion is a huge factor. I find I can wear anything now and feel better about myself. When you get a killer outfit together you really feel like a million bucks.

---------

I know most of you won't want to hear this kinda stuff. I always ignored gym rats and guys talking about reps and their biceps and shit. But really, be the guy that looks so good people wonder what *you* must do for a living.

1375737994.0,1jrmmq,A comprehensive guide to the kilt,pirieca,1029,335,286,"Right, it is somewhat effective. It is however an exceedingly complex attire

As a Scotsman and also a historian, and not a history lesson, I will focus on the outfit. If you are interested in the (extremely fascinating) history behind the kilt, I wrote a good summary of the origins of the modern iteration of the kilt [here on AskHistorians](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1d4w6j/i_was_just_rewatching_braveheart_and_now_im/c9n1pqz). Now, let's dive in.

_____________________________________________________________
**Occasions**

The Modern kilt should be worn in only three settings

* [Formal occasions](http://www.kiltrental.com/Prom%20Black%20Watch%20kilt.jpg) - Black-tie
* [Scottish heritage events]( http://www.myceilidh.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/HotScotch-Monaco.jpg) - Highland games
* Scottish National football matches, pulled-down socks and chunky shoes - the uniform)   

Though this is a personal view
______________________________________________________________
**The Kilt**

The kilt itself is in its most usual form, is highly durable, and provides all-important air conditioning to the nether regions. They are of course typically tartan (though you do get more modern [fashion kilts](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-F-KltaTQhHM/UbPGO_V2NHI/AAAAAAAAAG8/9IAak5oBRD4/s1600/3294046702_f63e76ebfc.jpg)), and double buckled to create the wraparound effect.

As this is more a guide on the outfit as a whole, [Hunting]( http://www.lochcarron.com/reiver/MacA-D/mdh_a.jpg) (more Green), [Muted]( http://www.lochcarron.com/reiver/MacA-D/md_a.jpg) (more understated), and many others. These examples are all [Macdonald tartan](http://www.lochcarron.com/reiver/MacA-D/md_m.jpg), for example.

**Fit**

Kilts are worn around the belly, the kilt should sit between the middle and top of the kneecap - no higher, no lower - [like this](http://www.kinlochanderson.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/320x427/5e06319eda06f020e43594a9c230972d/k/i/kinloch_anderson_kilt.jpg)
_____________________________________________________________
**Jackets and Waistcoats**

Kilts must always be worn with the appropriate top-half attire. There are a wide variety of kilt jackets to wear, and Day Jackets. All are woollen, and mitigate any cooling breezes downstairs by bathing you in your own sweat up top.

[**The Prince Charlie**](http://www.stkildaretail.com.au/images/main/vpc_a.jpg)

The most formal of the popular options, and is only ever worn with the waistcoat.

[**The Argyll**](http://scotweb-objects.com/images/items1/sr_swhdr_classic_black_argyll_vest.jpg)

Slightly less formal, it can be worn at both black tie events, and more informal day events, such as gatherings or weddings. The traditional waistcoat pairing is the 5-button waistcoat shown, though the Argyll can be worn without it just as well.

[**Day Jackets**](http://www.kinlochanderson.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/320x427/5e06319eda06f020e43594a9c230972d/t/h/the_kinloch_anderson_day_kilt_jacket_in_green_lovat_tweed_special_order_dj-gl-so.jpg)

The most casual of the trio, light greens, and even dark greens! (blue is also acceptable but likely to receive odd looks from the gentry). These are generally seen on occasions such as gatherings, hunts etc. and would not be welcome at black-tie functions. Broadswords may come out (pun fully intended)
_____________________________________________________________
**Accessories**

Arguably, so I will summarise them together, starting with the biggest and working down.

**Neckties**

Generally there are three options to hang round your neck when it comes to Highland attire. in descending order of formality, black), [cravats](http://www.irishkilts.co.uk/images-2006/main-page/spirit-bannockburn.jpg) (normally matching or complementing your tartan, and always worn with a waistcoat), and [woollen or tweed ties](http://www.jmkilts.co.uk/pictures/pic44db32c47109e.jpg) (other materials are passable, but when so dashing in your woollen kilt, why not complete the set?) 

**Sporran**

The manliest form of bag possible, and essentially rests on your junk. Some simple ones are [leather](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQso-rY4nfJo7CLhMsnMn-vS2ZQXNmWxQuzRbgpBalZks5yFjQo), whereas others can be [extremely ornate](http://www.edinburghbagpipes.co.uk/images/no%201%20sporran%20EBC.jpg), made of the hair of horses, hares and even badgers. Ornate ones tend to be reserved for special occasions, whereas leather ones are far more for utility (as seen in the photo of myself in a rather dashing football top).

**Socks**

Kilt wearers adorn what are known as kilt hose, though more modern iterations pull off [black socks](http://www.highlandstore.com/acatalog/kilt_packages_black_spirit.jpg) very well. Both compliment evening wear. They are always worn with flashes as well, seen in the photos above.

Other colours, and other earth colours tend to be reserved for day jacket outfits, and are almost always match the jacket itself. 

**Shoes**

Thought tying shoe laces was easy? Spare a thought for the 16-year old Scotsman tackling [ghillie brogues](http://images.sodahead.com/polls/000688573/polls_GhillieBrogues01_2251_484862_poll_xlarge.jpeg) for the first time. They are seen as the only option for evening wear kilt outfits, and are twisted round numerous times. Just an extra little accent that really asserts the kilt as the king of accessories.

**Ornaments**

There are a number of other authentic accessories which really set the kilt apart from other formal-wear. Items such as **kilt pins** are one such example, or [animal feet](https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSKR1pVfZ5YTyenNF0duxEw4-648ptdhcRm-BQ7q5Nq32jh_CaB).

The final and perhaps most interesting piece of the puzzle is the **Sgian Dubh** (said ski-en doo). It is a [small dagger](http://www.knivesbynick.co.uk/images/hi/knives/historical/buff_sgian_dubh.jpg) placed in the [top of the sock](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Sgian_Dubh.jpg/220px-Sgian_Dubh.jpg). Originally out of manners when attending other clan feasts (it was polite to carry your own knife for dining), and handles made of stag horn, but many simply carry the family crest.

**Underwear**

Nope. You should all know that this really goes without saying...

While I’m sure this is not something that will seriously influence the style of anyone on MFA, but I think this a strong start at documenting and explaining this oft ignored style. 

While /r/malefashionadvice and /r/metal seem like odd bedfellows


*Also

______________________________________________________________________________________________

**Background**

The basis for style within the metal community comes from a number of influences and artists. While Black Sabbath laid down the foundation for the music

[Leather obsessed Rob Halford brought the first long lasting style](http://i.imgur.com/LVldA)  into the mainstream metal world with his over the top all-leather outfits adapted from the gay leather scene of London and elsewhere in the 70s. The biker machismo of leather took the forefront over the homosexual aspect but the metal world has been hellbent on the material ever since. 

[Motörhead](http://i.imgur.com/DoUIX) helped bridge the gap between punk and metal which brought about a melting pot of fashion and style into both communities. Punk was a changing but still fully developed style and metal’s fledgling status meant it would adopt much of the scene’s style. Through punk influence, [spikes and studs.](http://i.imgur.com/p2DVr.jpg) While Motörhead’s western look never took off, they opened doors both musically and stylistically. 

Finally you have [King Diamond’s push for theatrics and visual showmanship.](http://i.imgur.com/0BfXS.jpg) Alice Cooper may have already been cutting his head off, [many bands still utilize](http://i.imgur.com/nkO7X.jpg) [powerful imagery](http://i.imgur.com/PENeL.jpg) [in their live performances.](http://i.imgur.com/VySOM.jpg)


[**Battle Jacket**](http://i.imgur.com/1C4ss.jpg)

The battle jacket, but tells a story to those in your social scene. As a tie in your college colors tells the world of your affiliation and background, the battle jacket is designed to show where your devotion lies. The battle jacket, another adoption from the [punk/hardcore scene](http://i.imgur.com/aPxaK.jpg), essentially allows you to wear multiple band shirts at once and shows your devotion to your favorite bands. Patches are a way to support a band, and to learn about new bands from fellow metalheads. Not only are the patches meant to bring fans together, but they also allowed bands to advertise in the pre-internet era.  The ultimate sign of devotion to a band is to give them the coveted [back patch in the back center of your jacket.](http://i.imgur.com/WclZv.jpg) These oversized patches scream to the masses that you hold no other bands above said band (or they have a really sick back patch). 

Battle jackets remain most popular among thrash fans but [black metal fans](http://i.imgur.com/WKBGh.jpg) are also big supporters of this aspect of the heavy metal uniform. Typically

**Boots**

Boots are the only thing besides a black band tee that cross all genre boundaries and have never faded out of style. The purpose and popularity of boots are 3-fold. Boots can take a beating which makes them popular among touring bands with very little cash (and when bands start to do something

**Pants**
Jeans are the predominate pants in the metal community. Black is obviously universally regarded as the go-to color but a pair of light wash blue denim is fairly popular amongst thrashers. Jeans are on the skinnier side but have loosened up a bit after the popularity of “skinny” jeans amongst post-hardcore and metalcore fans. Metalheads rarely wear [crust pants.](http://i.imgur.com/wG85c.jpg) 

While jeans are the most popular

Some people

**Genre Specific Clothing**

&gt;Thrash

It would appear that I am focusing most of my efforts into the thrash metal genre but if we’re talking about metal style

*Nike High Tops*

Looking back on pictures of 80s thrash bands you find a surprising amount of [high-tops](http://i.imgur.com/GdHww.jpg) for a genre so fond of military imagery and accessories. The shoes, thanks in part, to record labels. Dave Mustaine said that when he signed his record deal with Capitol (or Combat, I can’t remember) the band was given next to no money, but they did get [white Nike High Tops.](http://i.imgur.com/CQISL.jpg) As one of the most influential bands in thrash, you can bet the [rest of the metal world would follow in their footsteps.](http://i.imgur.com/XUyS8.jpg)

[*Bullet Belt*](http://i.imgur.com/M303f.jpg)

The bullet belt is the most obvious influence of military style in the metal community. Beloved across genres and styles, which is an absolute must, but army surplus stores often stock them because they are a sought after item. 

&gt;Death Metal

The death metal community may be the least style heavy genre in the extreme metal community. Straight-forward and raw, and battle jackets [exist](http://i.imgur.com/i2btw.jpg) but not to the level of thrash or BM. 

&gt;Black Metal

Stylistically 2nd Wave Black Metal musicians take the cake when it comes to aesthetics. Visually influenced by Mercyful Fate and Venom


Visually
Another aspect of the black metal style for performers is dangerous accessories in the form of [weapons](http://www.thegauntlet.com/pics/Immortal%20-%20Band.jpg) and [spiked leather gauntlets.](http://i.imgur.com/p2DVr.jpg)  Nothing screams inaccessible and dangerous quite like a man with an axe or with 7 inch spikes coming out of their arms.   

Unlike other genres of metal

After recently studying abroad in Japan, so I figured this would be an album I would enjoy putting together. 

I think this album gives a good representation of street fashion in Japan, and Shinjuku in Tokyo. These are the areas where the most interesting and diverse trends stem from. There are many different styles in Japan and I tried to capture a good mix of them in this album - both male and female, although the album's emphasis is on men because this is, of course, *male*fashionadvice. 

Personally, and in some cases, the shear simplicity of an outfit.

I hope these images find some of you well! I would be interested in hearing what you do / don't like about Japanese street fashion.

1369168678.0,1escts,Guide to Summer Beach Club Attire,Billy_Brubaker,866,196,222,"I had great time writing [my last guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1dr04d/springsummer_guide_to_nightclub_wear/)

Memorial Day is coming upon us in the US, [a beer garden](http://i.imgur.com/AvsFyOj.jpg), [your favorite brunch spot](http://i.imgur.com/wDqm1O1.jpg) or whatever else is the place the be; you're outside, getting some drinks and enjoying the beautiful weather.

To preface

As you all know by now, you're going to be in the opposite scenario now.  You will have plenty of space and lighting, everything you wear will be visible.  As a result, its important to try and find what clothes are right for you.

As I just said, shirt or shoes.  If you mix too many bold patterns and colors, you're going to give off the [classic fratty vibe](http://i.imgur.com/0uah7rH.jpg).  If that's your thing, go for it, but if not keep one item bold and the other subtle (white, light grey, khaki).  I'd also avoid black and earth tones, don't be afraid to go bold with your colors and patterns.

Ok

**Shirt:**

You have options here.  [T-Shirts](http://redd.it/d08wh), it is worth reading those guides if you have not.  Both guides are very well written and explain a lot when it comes to fit. 

When choosing your shirt

Don't be afraid to try out something new here.  The event is going to be very casual

As an aside, but when I dressing for this scenario with a button down, I like to the shirt to land at the same place a tshirt would.  Just below the belt in the front and slightly higher in the sides.  Just long enough so that you're able to bend and sit down without the shirt coming above your belt line.

Sleeve rolling is the best way to mask all those missed gym days.  It should go without saying for long sleeve shirts

If you're going with a t-shirt it's important to choose the style that fits you best.  Personally, these work better on smaller guys whereas V-necks are better for bigger guys.  Crew neck are nice middle ground, I'd suggest something similar to [Ball &amp; Buck](http://ballandbuck.com/collections/ball-and-buck-t-shirts/products/ball-and-buck-original-pocket-tee) so you don't look like you're wearing an undershirt out there.  Outlier also makes great t's if you can afford to go for it.


**Pants:**

OK

I'm a big fan of shorts in these scenarios.  They're slightly cheaper and there's more room for error in terms of fit.  In my opinion, if you're going to be uncomfortable in a 7"", go with a 8-10"" short.  It's better to be confident in what you're wearing.  If you want to go with a 5"" and have the legs for it, by all means do it.  Personally, I'm a big fan of [Bonobos](http://www.bonobos.com/stone-cotton-shorts-for-men-b-s-knees) and [J.Crew](http://www.jcrew.com/mens_category/shorts/stantonshorts/PRDOVR~75488/75488.jsp) for shorts.  They both make them in a variety of colors and sizes for about $65 a pair.  As an aside, I do have a pair of Lacoste shorts, I'd avoid as they're more money and I'm not a fan of the branding.  Quality and fit wise

The other option is chinos.  These are going to be tougher than shorts as a poor fit is going to be much more apparent than it would be with shorts.  The first step here is to find the pair that fits you the best.  Luckily, size up and you can always tailor the pants.  The key is to keep the leg opening on the slim but not skinny side and to not have the pants break against your shoes.  

You can also cuff the pants

In terms of color when choosing pants or shorts

**Intermission:**

OK

**Shoes**

BOAT SHOES ARE AWESOMEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!1!!!11!!!!!!!

But in all honestly

OK now that I put out the boat shoe shoutout

Don't be afraid to drop a little money on some shoes here.  You're going somewhere nice, I'm going to be going around in a pair of [Oakstreet Bootmakers Crepe Sole Penny's](http://i.imgur.com/99Xppd6.jpg) this summer.  Besides OSB [Rancourt](http://www.rancourtandcompany.com/men-s-1/penny-loafers.html) makes a nice Made In USA penny loafer.  One of my buddies always wears [these Cole Haan](http://www.zappos.com/cole-haan-howland-penny-saddle-tan?zfcTest=fcl%3A2) driving sole penny loafers and seems to like them a lot.  The driving sole is nice as it will give you a very low profile.

If you're keeping your pants a subtle white, his guide is worth reading as that might be something that you are into.

[Buck's](http://i.imgur.com/2jqpjOr.jpg) might also be the style of shoe for you.  They're going to stand out slightly more than the penny loafer

You can also wear sneakers.  You know the drill here.  [Converses, I mean if you're wearing blue chinos, maybe wear a white sneaker.  If you're wearing a pair of khaki chinos, now's the time to try out those [floral shoes](http://i.imgur.com/chtvazj.jpg) you've had sitting around.  

However, if you're shoes are colored wear colorless pants and a colored shirt.  Or colored pants with a colorless shirt and shoes.  This is how to further avoid that ""frat bro""/clown look.

**Accessories:**

Watches are a nice thing to wear at this time.  Put your phone in your pocket and keep it there, the Tissot Visodate is perfectly capable of being worn in a casual manner as it's not a true dress watch.  If you can fit something similar into your wardrobe, go for it.  It's a beautiful watch.

Hats.  Unless you're at a ballgame, do what you got to do.  A hat looks better than having your hair all disheveled looking.

Bracelets are good if that's your thing.  I personally don't wear one but I've considered it.  [Tanner](http://www.tannergoods.com/products/double-wristband-saddle-tan-brass) and [KJP](https://kieljamespatrick.com/) both make some pretty cool bracelets.

Sunglasses.  Should you have sunglasses, you wouldn't wear running shoes so why would you wear running sunglasses.  Furthermore, when selecting sunglasses it's important buy ones that allow your eye brows to be visible. 

[Neutrogena](http://www.neutrogena.com/product/ultra+sheer+body+mist+sunscreen+broad+spectrum+spf+30.do?sortby=ourPicks) makes the best sunblock ever

If there's something I missed

As with the last guide

###Color Theory 101  
----
&gt; 

##Hue

Colors have 3 basic attributes that we’ll use to describe them:

1. Hue – When people talk about “colors”

2. Saturation – The intensity of a color. Highly saturated colors are full/rich/vivid. As a color loses saturation

3. Lightness/Value – The brightness or darkness of a color.

[This photoshop tool sums it up nicely](http://imgur.com/w0yQz)

##Contrast
Contrast is the perceived difference between two different colors.

You can have contrast of value – black and white are opposites

Colors that are more similar have less contrast. If the hue/saturation of two colors is similar

[Here’s a diagram demonstrating this.](http://imgur.com/v4fcH)

There’s a LOT more to be said about color theory

A piece of advice I see here all the time: “Just use the color wheel”. [The color wheel](http://imgur.com/Tl9tb) is awesome, and the color wheel is not a very useful tool on its own.

Instead, with accompanying looks.     
  
----------  
  
&gt;  

###[The giant seasonal menswear color spectrum diagram thing 1.0](http://imgur.com/hiJfB)

--------

Now

###Bright Colors:

- [Blues](http://imgur.com/vC1E9) and [reds](http://imgur.com/efOFT) of any lightness

- [Bright yellow](http://imgur.com/awTyS) and orange

- Medium – light [green](http://imgur.com/irib9)

- [Teals/robin’s egg blue](http://imgur.com/AlcDr)

- [Cream](http://imgur.com/MoJhW) or [Khaki](http://imgur.com/Woh1k)

- The [brightest white](http://imgur.com/InjDd) you can get your hands on

- [Lighter](http://imgur.com/esfhq)

These colors are more saturated (intense). Just about any color can be amped up to fit in this category. Ever seen [the shirt shelves at Express](http://imgur.com/smFBZ)? This shit is their bread and butter.

Be very careful with these. They’re the opposite of pastels. The intensity of these colors needs to be smartly balanced or risk being way too “in your face”. When you’ve got a loud piece of clothing, but it's held down by the fact that the vast majority of the outfit is very plainly colored. If you don't balance your crazy colors, you run the risk of looking like [this douche](http://imgur.com/Jf9UU).

##In spring:

Tone down with whites, and light –medium greys and browns. Use unpatterned things as inner layers, and in small areas. I’m really partial to white polkdots, or colored dots on white, but it’s a somewhat feminine look and pretty hard to find items like that. Medium width stripes, especially in pink, green, usually on shirts.

##In summer:

Contrast pieces. Pick an article of clothing and make it loud as all hell. Go for big, shirts made of a few big solid blocks of color, etc. 

Building entire outfits out of really, and carried over pretty strongly into fall, especially jcrew’s women’s line. Insanely bright pants, shorts, and casual shoes are going to be par for the course in summer. If you want to really stand out, get a bright blazer or a buck/derby shoe in something nuts([one](http://imgur.com/xzpMO)[two](http://imgur.com/uxoz7)). I suggest a [melon-ish red](http://imgur.com/iwvUF)/pink or a very saturated blue. It’s trendy for yellows to err slightly on the side of green. Pair any of these with white and a little bit of honey brown and you’re solid. 

##In fall: 

Balance these out with a lot of earth tones. Keep them buried and just let them peek out. The exception to this is vests. You can get away with some [pretty intense vests](http://imgur.com/RjLcA) in the fall

##In winter: 

White is definitely the easiest to pull off in winter. Use it generously. Keep the teal,  do so [with accessories](http://imgur.com/QH02y), and go for the really saturated medium tones –without going all the way neon. Red, not pink. Dandelion yellow, not that greenish one that everybody loves in summer. The fall rule about burying them and just letting a hint peek out applies doubly.  If you’re gonna work a crazy bright piece into a winter outfit, I suggest [scarves](http://imgur.com/nYCeA) or shoes/laces. Bright socks are a little played out/tryhard IMO, but there are a lot of people who would disagree

   
###Pastels: 
  
&gt;  


These colors are lighter and desaturated (pale). 

- [Light Blue](http://imgur.com/BOss5)

- [Light Pink](http://imgur.com/Hersc)

- [Light Green](http://imgur.com/EjHPR)

- [Light Grey](http://imgur.com/J3Gys)

- [Light Khaki](http://imgur.com/GF4NN)

Any color can be brightened into a pastel. Because they’re so calm

##In spring:

Pair with other pastels for outfits that are [appropriately light](http://imgur.com/fnxhG) without being [as in-your-face as summer](http://imgur.com/A0K3l). Work in medium browns and blues for contrast.  Keep your pastels solid. Patterns can be any size/density. Minimal contrast will feel cooler/lighter, seersucker, etc.

##In summer: 

Aim for high contrast in either direction. Pair with bright whites or very light khakis and the pastels will look more like midtones. Add a dark belt and shoes to make sure you don’t look too washed out. [Example](http://imgur.com/kxUkN) If you have patterns

##In fall:

Texture is key. Thicken all the things! [Chambray](http://imgur.com/LmqIk) or heather fabrics are great. Go slightly darker where possible, more autumny stuff. Blue and orangered are the best pastels for fall IMO. Keep your greens more towards olive, and your pinks more towards cherry. For [high contrast](http://imgur.com/0d4fg), pair with deep, dark browns, navy, and charcoal. In [more monotone looks](http://imgur.com/LuR2Z)

##In winter:

[Bury them even further](http://imgur.com/Zwoek) than in fall. Layer under sweaters and coats, and khakis, pastels will probably not be a big part of your winter getup. If you have to have a patterned pastel in winter, steer away from stripes and more towards dots/speckles, gingham, or tartan.

**Sweatshirt fit**

A sweatshirt should fit one of two ways: tight and hugging the body or loose and boxy. Vintage sweatshirts (or repro sweats) will generally fit boxy and short in the body (though some are slim) and narrow in the arms

**Fabric/Construction**

*French terry*: also known as loop terry, creating loops with the fabric and allowing it to absorb large amount of water or, in the case of sweatshirts, perspiration. It can be 100% cotton or a cotton-poly blend. Unlike terrycloth towels, however, French terry is woven in such a way as to have the absorbent looped fabric on only side, with the other side being flat.

*Cotton fleece*: fleece, soft pile.

*The purpose of that V thingie*: that V *thingie*, a vestigial part of sweatshirt construction left over from the 1940s. The double V gusset that we’d find on both the front and the back of the neck in sweatshirts from the 1930s and 1940s was used for two purposes: one, to limit and control the stretch of the collar; and two, to absorb sweat (sweatshirts were, after all, athletic wear first and foremost). By the 1950s tho, it had become just a an extra layer of ribbed cotton stiched onto the collar. By the 1960s it was just two intersecting for decoration and eventually it was phased out all together until quite recently.

*Tubular knit construction*: also known as tube body construction, an increased expense. Tube body construction is still used for socks because socks are generally only made in one-size-fits-all or 2 sizes.

*Loopwheeled cotton*: there are some huge misconceptions about loopwheeled cotton and a whole lot of marketing bullshit from companies that misrepresent their products as loopwheeled when in reality they’re simply tubular knit or maybe not even that. [This](http://i.imgur.com/HZYmF.jpg) is what a loopwheeling machine looks like. Pretty fucking cool

* All loopwheeling machines

* The cotton is fed into the machine via gravity

* The fabric is knit extremely slowly. Like

* The fabric must be cut by hand.

1368548093.0,1ebksl,D.I.Y. Guide - Tee sleeve accents,jknowl3m,946,308,141,"I'd wanted to add some personal touches to otherwise plain basics for quite some time but after scouring local material stores I could never find any patterns that appealed to me. Then it hit me...thrift stores. For some reason it didn't occur to me that shirts would substitute as fabric samples. It's good because there are obviously tons of options at thrift stores

I picked up this [white v neck from h&amp;m for $10 i think and this womans shirt from a thrift store for $3](http://i.imgur.com/pdxMSEI.jpg?1) so total cost was $13 plus time. Cheaper if you want to thrift the t shirt too. I just used the sleeves from the womans shirt to do my cuffs but you could quite as easily do this with a section from the torso etc

* [First pin the sleeves together so that they are flush](http://i.imgur.com/83NDIWn.jpg?1). Measure in 1.5 - 2"" (depending on how big you want the cuff) and mark it.

* If you're like me and don't have a serger or pinking sheers you're going to want to [add a zig zag stitch](http://i.imgur.com/WCUX770.jpg?1) in order to stop the material from fraying. Do it on the inside of the line so it will fall between where you cut and the rest of the cuff. 

* Now you can [cut the sleeve off](http://i.imgur.com/hK7rCCp.jpg?1) right next to your zig zag stitch. Try and get as close to the stitch as possible without cutting into the stitch itself. 

* [Laying the cuff next to the sleeve](http://i.imgur.com/IUgl9tq.jpg) you can see that they aren't quite the same length. I don't know about you guys but it took me a little while to wrap my head around this next part haha. The white v neck is cotton with some elastic in it to give it some stretch while the floral cuff is simple cotton and has almost no give. If the shirt you have chosen stretches to fit around your guns then this part may be a little tough. Because the cuff doesn't stretch, 3"" for a more comfortable fit, then divide by 2. This is the width you want the cuff to be when laying flat. (ie. 15"" bicep + 3"" = 18""... / 2 = 9""). In my case however, the sleeves on the t shirt fit my arms without having to stretch, so I could simply pin the cuff to the shirt sleeve without stretching the fabric because that was the circumference I needed. 

* Cut the cuff in half so that you have [one long strip like so.](http://i.imgur.com/8rKyKsT.jpg?1) 

* Turn the t shirt inside out and [start to pin the cuff to the sleeve of the shirt](http://i.imgur.com/BXT9N7v.jpg?1). THIS PART IS CRUCIAL DON'T DO WHAT I DID INITIALLY BECAUSE YOU'LL PROBABLY GIVE UP AT THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT TAKES TO CORRECT, and if you want this side to show then you need to pin it so that it's facing you when you pin it to the shirt sleeve (remember your shirt is inside out at this point). If the cuff was wider than the sleeve of the shirt (like mine) you're going to have some overlap when you get to the end of pinning the cuff to the shirt. Do your best to try and get the overlap to occur closer to the arm pit. You're going to be sewing the ends together later and it'll look better if they're out of sight.  Like I mentioned previously, if the sleeves don't need to stretch to fit your arms, then simply pin the cuff to the sleeve making sure that the sleeve of the shirt does not stretch at all while you're pinning it. However, if the sleeves do stretch then you're probably going to be spending this time at the gym rather than sewing some damn cuffs haha. If you manage to find time between reps, you're going to have to stretch the sleeve, pin the cuff, pin the cuff. Keep doing this until you've reached the desired circumference. 

* Once everything is pinned, [it's time to start sewing](http://i.imgur.com/C6NgKJp.jpg?1). Your first stitch around should be the longest setting you have, that way if you've messed it up it's easy to pick out and reset. Once you've done that and you're happy with the results, go back and stitch with the shortest length you have. This will give you the strongest seam possible. 

* Now there should be a section where the cuff overlaps itself. Because you're going to be turning up the cuff anyways

* Finally turn your shirt right side out

* [ta daaaaa](http://i.imgur.com/WVEYhVz.jpg)

*So something tells me that most people dont like this. I understand this guide is not perfect but thank you for reading. I hope to see some more good stuff in the future. Better than this.*
 
---
 
&gt; **Preface**
 
- *What do you mean ""Ideal""
 
This is simply my take on today's *ideal* streetwear. You may not agree with many statements in this thread, and respectable streetwear look.
 
- *I want to do something that you don't recommend... is this okay?*
 
Yes. In fact
 
- *Who are you to say you should write the streetwear guide instead of someone else?*
 
I've seen it said a couple times on MFA that I wear streetwear more often than other people
 
This is just my take.
 
---
 
&gt; **Intro**
 
Streetwear is one of the most ever-changing styles in today's world. Over the last decade
 
Keep in mind that Streetwear is an extremely versatile style that can be used for many different looks.
 
---
 
[**STREETWEAR INSPIRATION ALBUM**](http://imgur.com/a/pAcSI#0)
 
This is just to get you thinking
 
---
 
&gt; **The Mentality**
 
There is a brutal, there aren’t many people to blame about this. It is something that generally comes with every style.
 
Let me give an example: Here are two shirts, same design, and similar lettering. Just different words and size. Why aren't both just as cool?"" The reason the Supreme shirt is better than the Obey one is because the streetwear society has given it a more respected name. This doesnt go for JUST similar logos, it pretty much goes for any brand that isnt respected or liked in the streetwear world. So to be 100% bluntly honest, if you wear anything that has an [Obey logo](http://wac.3faa.edgecastcdn.net/803FAA/assets/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/1000x1000/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/0/5/052207.png) on it, people wont like it. And no its not just Obey, I'm only using this as an example... there are hundreds of hated brands.
 
So who is giving these brands such a bad name? [Kids like this](http://31.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m0jhy6OVdA1rpmiymo1_500.gif). Brands like Obey have become incredibly tacky due to over branding by people (teenagers) that think that these designs are very in style. Which is fine
 
 
---
 
&gt; **Branding**
 
Don't be afraid of some brand names! If you want to infuse some streetwear into your looks, ""swag-fags"" or even... yes... ""fuckbois"". These are not my words, but the words of those who frown upon some brand logos. I am not going to go into detail in ""which"" logos are liked and which are disliked; in the end its personal preference. Just remember, if you have to ask your self ""Does this logo look too tacky/obnoxious?"" then it probably does.
 
---
 
&gt; **Colors**
 
The color of your fit can completely change everything about it. Your probably saying, blues, yellows and oranges unless they are toned by other colors. For example, the same red that you saw in the image above can be [toned by other colors](http://images.jordansdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/kanye-west-wearing-air-jordan-ajko-bred-570x450.jpg) for a good statement item.
 
The most important colors in streetwear are **black** and **white**. Actually, **olive**, and **gray**. I feel that these colors are really safe because this way its hard to clash. Colors like purple can be very hard to pull off unless its in a statement item (see below). Other colors to look into are **Tan** (for chinos), **Brown**, and **Dark Red** (Pomegranate).
 
---
 
&gt; **This looks fine/This looks silly**
 
And now... a game I like to call... This looks fine/This looks silly! A brief overview of what to avoid in streetwear.
 
**Headwear:** Stay away from team logos that aren't the classic logo. [This looks fine](http://www.blogcdn.com/www.bvnewswire.com/media/2009/11/jay-z-jeter-yankees-parade-110609.jpg)/[This looks silly](http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6221/7006449069_5dcddb7bab_z.jpg).
 
**Shirts**: Dont button the top button unless you're wearing a tie. And this is streetwear so don't wear a tie. [This looks fine](http://i.imgur.com/Rleaj.jpg)/[This looks silly](http://fashdloops.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Niall-Horan-One-Direction-2013-Hairstyles-Trends.jpg).
 
**Tees**: Stay away from things that are way too tight
 
**Sneakers**: Stay away from cheap sneakers and ""new colorways"". Stick to the good quality and classic designs. And if they're expensive... save up. [This looks fine](http://solecollector.com/media/u/images/frank-ocean-air-jordan-i-1-black-blue-header.jpg)/[This look silly](http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y84/JustinsPhotobucket/12-28_fashion-hypebeasts.jpg).
 
**How to find looks to avoid:** 1. Go to tumblr 2. Click search tags 3. Search for the tag #swag
 
*Its that easy*
 
---
 
&gt; **Streetwear Influence**
 
How is streetwear created/influenced? Famous people. Its generally famous people that give the name to the big brands. Some times this is good. Sometimes this is bad. Well its safe to say that the hip-hop collective [Odd Future](http://27.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lgto2nMXPr1qa98opo1_500.jpg) helped boost the popularity of Supreme. Which is fine. But then you end up with kids [like this](http://p.twimg.com/AdDQy2eCQAAApZQ.jpg:large). Kanye West boosted popularity of leather pants and Jordans
 
*""Emulate your icons
 
      -- Andre 3000
 
I cannot stress that enough.
 
So yes. People do influence style

&gt; **Total Brand Guide**
 
*Throughout the guide you'll find recommended brands at the end of each section. This is a total list of general streetwear brands the pertain to pretty much all articles of clothing.*
 
Do not be afraid to seek out new brands. These are just a short list of brands to consider. All I'm trying to do is to get your mind moving in a streetwear direction.
 
**Low Tier - $**
 
- [**Stussy**](http://www.stussy.com/) - Good for starter streetwear. Many classic and basic looks. Very accesable but not too overbranded.
- [**Levis**](http://us.levi.com/home/index.jsp) - A great starter denim brand. Levis cuts are very classic and a decent quality for their price.
- **[Vans](http://www.vans.com/)** - Good footwear brand for generally any budget. Vans have a classic skate style to them.
- **[Uniqlo](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/)** - Use for basic pieces like oxford or tees. Uniqlo frequently does some good collaborations as well (UU
- **[DQM](http://dqmnewyork.com/)** - New York skate brand. Similar to Stussy but with more basic looks.
- **[Converse](http://www.converse.com/)** - good original sneakers.
- **[Unbranded](http://theunbrandedbrand.com/collections/all)** - Not super low quality but the lowest price you can get for raw denim.

The purpose of this guide is to help steer beginners in the right direction when shopping. This list is meant to be an informative resource, tees); however this guide is intended to give a brand summary about certain companies and designs, especially as it concerns questionable content. 


##Please Read

* I have taken the community's comments into consideration and will continue to do so. If you think a brand does not belong, a buyer should be wary of the listed issues with these brands. Shop critically and do research before purchasing. 
* If you like some of these brands
* Note that some of these brands are sporty. I am not suggesting that sportwear should not be used for track or sport. I am simply arguing that a buyer should be careful not to wear certain activewear as casualwear.
* And finally, these are just suggestions and summaries intended to aid beginners.

**I. Terminology**

*  *Thread Count*: The number of woven yarns in a square inch. In other words it’s a measure of density. Higher thread count means that the weave will be tighter (like bed sheets) and lower thread count means that the weave will be more open (like burlap). 
*  *Plys*: Raw material needs to be spun into yarn (imagine a piece of rope), more resilient to wear, and last longer. [Here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Spool_of_white_thread.jpg) is a spool of 2-ply thread where you can see the two threads twisted together. 
*  *Yarn Number*: When it comes to shirting this is more important than Thread Count. Yarns vary in how smooth or rough they are. Higher yarn numbers indicate that the threads used are thinner and finer
If you see a shirt advertised as 100/2 then that means the yarn number is 100 and the yarn has been spun 2-ply. 

*  *W&amp;W*: The yarn going vertically on the loom is called “warp” and the yarn going horizontally is known as “weft” [image](http://cdn8.nazmiyalantiquerugs.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/warp_weft_diagram.gif). Sometimes manufacturers advertise shirts as being 2-ply but cut costs by using only 2-ply in the warp but not the weft.
If you see a shirt that’s 100/2x2


**II. Types**

Weave is what affects the nature of the fabric more than anything else. There are too many types to discuss in detail so this guide covers the most common ones you’ll come across but is by no means exhaustive.


1. [Poplin and Broadcloth](http://i.imgur.com/yv55D6H.jpg):  The most common fabric used in shirting. It’s a plain weave which means that it’s created using an “over and under” pattern between the warp (vertical yarn) and weft (horizontal yarn). It results in a fairly light, will result in a huge range of quality. Because it is so ubiquitous you’ll get some very thin, almost translucent broadcloths (visible nipples) but also some that are quite substantial and suitable for wear in winter.


2. [End-on-End](http://i.imgur.com/In6hJeF.jpg): This is the same plain weave seen above but different coloured yarns are interspersed within the fabric’s “over and under” pattern. The result is something that’s more visually distinct and interesting to look at [up-close](http://i.imgur.com/CnxHndF.jpg)


3. [Oxford](http://i.imgur.com/1TJaXRF.jpg): One of MFA’s most beloved fabrics, and the added floating yarn is more susceptible to snags making it less durable. Some of the “flaws” of this fabric are really what makes it great though; an OCBD that’s been beat to hell becomes very soft and can look incredibly beautiful (similar to the fading of raw denim or patina on leather). 


4. [Pinpoint](http://imgur.com/4s2aMDx): Essentially the same weave as the standard oxford


5. [Royal Oxford](http://i.imgur.com/tsaeRIX.jpg): Has nothing to do with oxford or pinpoint fabrics because the weave is fairly elaborate and uses four yarns. The result is something that has substantial texture but remains very shiny. As you look at it from different angles it almost appears to glimmer. It is more formal than both oxford or pinpoint fabrics and is actually very pretty to look at. 


6. [Twill](http://i.imgur.com/EEjPuzg.jpg): Essentially a diagonal weave created by yarns woven at an [offset over-under weave](http://i.imgur.com/ZGMlJC6.gif). It’s a very subtle way to add texture to an outfit and the weave tends to be very soft
[Flannel](http://i.imgur.com/GZZk7SK.jpg) is basically brushed twill that retains its substantial weight but is less shiny much softer
If you look closely at your [denim](http://i.imgur.com/lVyCham.jpg) or [chinos](http://i.imgur.com/g2ECNp0.jpg) you’ll notice that they are both examples of a twill weave. 
If you own [tweed](http://i.imgur.com/IZhxuYX.jpg) you’ll notice that it’s wool twill. 
[Pick-and-Pick (aka Sharkskin)](http://i.imgur.com/ztKpgmN.jpg) was the suiting fabric that Pierce Brosnan wore as James Bond to make him stand out subtly without using too much colour. It doesn’t look like the other twills because it’s made with alternating colours within the tiny ""zig-zags"". The result is something that looks like a cross-hatch overlaying the usual diagonal weave. The technique and effect achieved is pretty similar to end-on-end. 
While we’re here


7. [Nailhead or Birdseye](http://i.imgur.com/bMmuKwW.jpg) the weave is aptly named and remarkably beautiful. It’s not super common but you can occasionally find them in suits (especially with custom makers). 


**III. Conclusions**

There are a huge array of different fabrics to choose from—each with their own advantages and disadvantages. Many factors play into the quality of a fabric from the quality of raw material itself, and the type of fabric you’re handling (or ask the sale’s associate). You’ll gradually develop a pretty instinctive touch for quality and develop your own preferences. From there you can start playing with the patterns in different fabrics (bengal stripes, gingham, tattersall, plaid etc.). 

I hope this clarifies some of confusion. If I’m missing something

The most important part of the suit is the fit. One illustration on the importance of fit can be seen [here](http://i.imgur.com/aAIFbCB.jpg).

There are three general types of suit cuts, but they are the [Italian cut](http://imgur.com/oP9hFEg,EArCuYX,d5zkOBA#2), [English cut](http://imgur.com/oP9hFEg,EArCuYX,d5zkOBA#1),EArCuYX

*How Should My Suit Fit?* - I'm going to be doing this a lot here, with a single break at the top of your shoes. Proper jacket fitting can be seen [here](http://imgur.com/x5j9NQv).

*Tailoring* - Almost anything in the suit can be tailored. The most important thing however is the shoulder fit - while it technically can be tailored, I'll direct you to this [Guide to Clothing Alteration](http://www.artofmanliness.com/2009/10/01/alteration_guide/).

Let's dive into some specifics!

**Jacket**

*Single versus Double breasted* - The difference is illustrated [here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2e/Single-Double-Breasted.svg). Single breasted is more popular right now, and it lends itself better to older men's style (roughly 40+) as well as larger men. For single breasted the standard is 2 buttons, while double breasted the standard is three rows of buttons.

*Buttons* - Buttons are found in two places on a suit jacket

Cuffs - On higher quality suits,9CGzt2w,qWrbuc7#3)) while cheaper suits they'll be sewn on only as decoration. If functional, these should stay buttoned at all times. Note that buying a shirt off the rack with surgeon's cuffs makes it very difficult though not impossible to get the sleeve length tailored.

Chest - Single breasted suits are further divided into two and three buttons. For a single breasted suit with two buttons, the bottom button is once again left open, with the middle button always buttoned. The top button is a matter of preference. With a double breasted, the middle button should be buttoned at all times while the top row of buttons are decorative. The bottom button, again, should stay unbuttoned.

*Lapels* - For suits,9CGzt2w,qWrbuc7#1). The other two options are peak and shawl lapels, but these are both generally more seen in black tie on a tuxedo, especially shawl collar.

*Vents* - A vent is the name for the slit opening in the rear of the jacket. You can have [one,tCpHMtN,9CGzt2w,qWrbuc7#2) in your jacket. Two vents tends to be the most flattering style on everyone. One vent can work, but it tends to draw attention to your rear - if this is what you're going for get a single vent. If you're not sure if you want to do this or not, you probably don't. No vents is only really done on a Tuxedo, you'd be hard pressed to even find it on a jacket.

*Sleeve Length* - Dress shirts should come down to the base of the thumb. The safest bet for jacket sleeve length is to show a little bit of shirt sleeve, as well as pictures, see [this article](https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/sleeve-length-suits-shirts-jackets/).

*Construction* - Jackets can be either fused, in order from cheapest to most expensive. If you want more details [Put This On has a good article about jacket construction](http://putthison.com/post/53763514327/why-pay-
for-canvas-as-many-readers-know-suit).

**Pants**

*Pleats* - ~~Pleated pants generally aren't flattering. The one exception is if you're larger

*Break* - Suit pants should have a single break in them

*Cuffs* - Cuffing is the practice of turning up the bottom of your pants for various effects. [Here](http://imgur.com/dx9GUBj, as well as a history of cuffing, can be found at [The Parisian Gentleman](http://parisiangentleman.co.uk/2013/07/24/a-second-look-at-trouser-turnups-cuffs/).

**Vest (Waistcoat)**

Vests are best worn with single-breasted suits. They can be worn with double-breasted, as well as much warmer. A safe choice of vest is one of the same material and pattern as the rest of the suit - differing patterns or colors can work, but as this is an introductory guide I won't touch on that. 

Vests themselves can come in either single- or double-breasted, you want to keep the very bottom button open much as with the suit jacket.

Outside the US

**Purchasing**

The biggest choice you'll have to make about suit purchasing is whether to buy a made to measure suit (MTM) or a suit off the rack (OTR). With a MTM suit, you take your own - and a suit is built specific to those measurements. The trade off of course is this method tends to be more expensive and takes longer to receive your suit. Off the rack on the other hand is buying a suit as it comes from the retailer. With an off the rack suit, in 99.99% of cases, you're going to want to get some alterations done so it fits you better. Many department stores will offer this service if you buy your suit from them, but look around and see if you have any local tailors that can do alterations.

Here's some places to buy (good/expensive) suiting

At lower price points all of the above still apply - the suits themselves will not wear nearly as well however and will deteriorate quicker. The fit on many of them is often sub-par

*Off The Rack (OTR)*

* [J. Crew:](https://www.jcrew.com/mens_feature/TheLudlowShop.jsp) $500-600

1310752155.0,iqljj,A Guide to Cologne,sithyiscool,718,158,161,"**Cologne**:Wearing cologne is a chemistry experiment. A bottle of cologne will contain extracts


**Types**: The different type is related to cologne’s strength and lasting power.  The higher percentage of aromatic compounds (more chemicals to evaporate)

* **Eau de Cologne**: 3-7%  of aromatic compounds: This means that it is much lighter than the concentrated perfume. It is delightfully refreshing in hot weather and because it doesn't last long

* **Eau de Toilette**: 7-12% of aromatic compounds: Eau de Toilette is more concentrated than Eau de Cologne. The top notes are dominant

* **Eau de Perfume (Parfum)**: 10-20% of aromatic compounds: This solution is more intense and lasts longer.  After the top notes have died away, but it usually lasts well and is sold in small sizes. It usually lasts 3 to 5 hours.

* **Perfume (Parfum)**: &gt;20% of aromatic compounds. This is the most expensive version of any fragrance.  This is due to the high concentration of essences. Perfume is applied directly to the skin on pulse spots. Only a tiny amount is needed


**Categories**:
**[The Fragrance Wheel](http://www.sniffapaloozamagazine.com/Fragrance_Wheel_2010_English.jpg)**: At the center of the wheel is the fougere group (not shown). This grouping of fragrances contains elements of all of the other four groupings and is then by definition its own family with both distinctions and commonality. Each of the other four groups occupies equidistant places around the perimeter of the wheel. Each of these families has subheadings

* **Floral**: This family contains three sub-headings, such as gardenia, jasmine, honeysuckle, lilac and orchid. Soft floral contains aldehydes, such as cinnanaldehyde, which gives the color and aroma to cinnamon. It also contains soft notes or powders such as, Moroccan jasmine and amber powder. Floral Oriental contains orange blossoms and sweet spices.

* **Oriental**: The subheadings are soft Oriental, musks and vanilla. The woody Oriental group contains aromatic woods such as sandalwood and patchouli.

* **Fresh**: Citrus, lime and orange oils. Fruity is as it sounds, having fragrances such as tangerine, raspberry, banana and strawberry. Green smells like leaves and grass, whereas water uses a chemical called calone. This compound is described as a fragrance that smells like a strong sea breeze that has a slight floral scent added to it.

* **Woody**: The sub-heads are wood


[**Notes**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Fragrance_pyramid.svg):
Most colognes go through a progression: top notes (last a few minutes)

* **Top (Head) Notes**: Perceived immediately upon application of a perfume,"" ""assertive"" or ""sharp."" The compounds that contribute to top notes are strong in scent, very volatile, and evaporate quickly. Citrus and ginger scents are common top notes. Also called the head notes. If one compares a fragrance with a conversation, then the top notes are the presentations and introduction. 

* **Middle (Heart) Notes**: The scent of a perfume that emerges just prior to when the top notes dissipate. Scents from this note class appear anywhere from two minutes to one hour after the application of a perfume. The middle note compounds form the ""heart"" or main body of a perfume and emerge in the middle of the perfume's dispersion process. They serve to mask the often unpleasant initial impression of base notes

* **Base**: The scent of a perfume that appears close to the departure of the middle notes. They usually not perceived until at least 30 minutes after the application of the perfume or during the period of perfume dry-down. The base and middle notes together are the main theme of a perfume. Base notes bring depth and solidity to a perfume. Compounds of this class are often the fixatives used to hold and boost the strength of the lighter top and middle notes. Consisting of large, very varied: birch, sandalwood, oak, cinnamon.  Depending on the species, different parts of the tree are used: bark, sap


**The Next Step: Buying, it is TOO much.

* **How to Buy &amp; Try**: Maximum to try at once is about 4 (2 suggested).  Spray one on each wrist and each inner elbow.  While you can use the cards the department store provides to smell the colognes, like coffee beans (usually provided). Smell all the notes! The initial smell isn’t necessarily the one that lingers for the rest of the day (called the “dry down”). Walk around the department store or mall, and smell the colognes at various intervals (1 minute, 5 minute, 30 minutes, 1 hour, etc.)

* **How to Store it**: Keep in a dry place, and keep the lid closed.  Colognes are bottles full of oils, chemicals and extracts, they can go bad!

* **Where to Apply**:Ideal place to apply cologne is where the body produces the [most heat]( http://www.infraredcamerasinc.com/images/Medical-Infrared-Thermography/Thermal-Infrared-Full-Body-Scan.jpg), chest, neck, thighs, back of knees, inner elbows, crotch.  This does NOT mean to spray each section! I suggest to always do wrists and neck.  These are the areas women most likely will encounter when close to you. 

* **How to Apply**:Spray 2-6 inches away from the skin. If you are applying cologne from a regular bottle

* **My Standard technique**: Spray wrist. Lightly press them together, or an extra wrist presses to the underarms.  The powerful colognes typically only get the wrist and neck, as it is more than enough.

* **Scent Overload**: Don't drown out your cologne with a lot of scented shampoos, aftershave, etc.  Colognes might also come with shower gels, aftershave and shampoos.  They don't necessarily smell exactly the same as the cologne. Overall, be smart with your combinations.  

* **Tips**: Apply cologne to your dry skin, and also evaporate more quickly. Don’t rub the cologne in: Friction causes it to evaporate more quickly, instead of its natural process.  A press or pat together is okay. 

* **Popular &amp; Trustworthy Colognes**: Go [here](http://www.basenotes.net/). It depends on YOUR BODY. Find your own. My personal favorites that smell good on ME: Light Blue by D&amp;G, Aqua Di Gio (although I never wear it anymore).

*This guide offers some tips and ideas on how you can make the most of your outfit on somebody else's special day. It will be mostly American-centric due to my lack of knowledge concerning International/British customs. Please feel free to chime-in. Again, your family, friends, or the couple getting married like you do, asking them for advice is a good idea too.*

___
**TL;DR: Choosing appropriate attire for a wedding is quite simple:**

1. Follow any stated or implied dress code. Ask someone close to the bride or groom if you're unsure.
2. Wear something appropriate for the occasion. Your outfit should be smart and festive, business, or funeral attire.
3. Don't overdress or attempt something too flamboyant. You'll want to wear clothing you're comfortable with and you don't want to accidentally upstage the bride or groom.

___
**BASIC WEDDING GUEST ATTIRE**

*If you're completely clueless at dressing yourself and you want to follow very specific rules concerning your outfit follow these guidelines to form something competent and presentable.* 

___
**Wear your smartest/nicest outfit in simple colors and limited patterns.**

Wear what you already own (or at least what's passable). All clothing should fit properly, nobody is too concerned with what you're wearing anyways, wedding days revolve around the happy couple.

**Attire #1:** *Wear this if possible*

[*A short album #1*](http://imgur.com/a/DSvui)

* **Suit** - Solid navy and gray are the safest colors
* **Shirt** - White or light blue dress shirt - point collar
* **Shoes** - Black dress shoes and belt
* **Tie** - Silk tie with texture, pindots, checks. Avoid solid satin, gaudy colors, and kitschy patterns (like repeating boats or cats). 
* **Pocket square** - *optional* - white linen in a simple TV fold is safest. DON'T wear a matching tie and pocket square set.

**Alternate attire #2:** *Assuming you don't have access to a suit* 

[*A short album #2*](http://imgur.com/a/9eQv6)

* **Jacket** - Navy blazer - wool is preferable
* **Pants** - Khaki or gray dress pants
* **Shirt** - White or light blue button-up shirt - point collar or button down
* **Shoes** - Black or brown dress shoes and belt. Brogues and loafers are acceptable.
* **Tie** - Silk tie with simple pattern or texture. Stripes

**Alternate attire #3:** *Assuming you don't have access to a suit or a blazer and you're UNDER THE AGE OF 21. If you're older than 21 you might consider beginning your semi-formal wardrobe. It'll get used more frequently as your friends or family get married or as you enter your professional career.*

[*A short album #3*](http://imgur.com/a/Ia3I2)

* **Shirt** - White, point or button down collar, barrell cuffs. 
* **Pants** - Khaki or gray pants
* **Shoes** - Brown dress shoes and belt. Brogues
* **Tie** - *optional* -  Repp stripes or knit silk in a navy or red base. Nothing wider than 3 1/4 inches

___
*If you're a bit more accomplished at dressing yourself and want to select something appropriate but individualized

I get it

**How formal is the wedding? What is the stated dress code?**

Most weddings will have guidelines for a dress code in the invitation or they will imply somehow to the formality of the occasion. Your job is to dress appropriately to match what the bride and groom specify, the dress code stipulates. ALWAYS FOLLOW THE DRESS CODE, even if it's something like tuxedos during the daytime or aloha shirts in a landlocked state, it's their wedding day, not yours. 

More formal attire includes more conservative color choices with suiting and shirting, colors in your shirt and tie, and casual leather shoes such as bucs, brogues, or mocassin styles. 

**When is the wedding? What time of day and what season?**

Nighttime weddings are generally more formal than daytime affairs and they're better for darker color palettes. Tuxedos should ONLY be considered for evening events (6:00 pm or sunset whichever comes first), you might consider bringing an extra layer for warmth.

Use the season to dictate your color choices and your material choices. Pay attention to the local weather forecast so you can dress for proper conditions and temperatures. Heavy fabrics such as tweed and flannel are better in fall/winter whereas tropical weight wool

* [Spring](http://i.imgur.com/9cRw42h.jpg) = pastels, light yellows
* [Summer](http://i.imgur.com/eHuvOtn.jpg) = bright colors, blues
* [Fall](http://i.imgur.com/7Flycj8.jpg) = earth tones
* [Winter](http://i.imgur.com/9RvRxMl.jpg) = deep colors, plum

**Where is the wedding located? Geographic location? Venue locations?**

Geographic location plays a large role in determining acceptable outfits due to changes in climate, New England is preppy, and large cities may have more forward thinking styles. If you're travelling to a region with different style than your own you have three options: 

* Dress in your own style - Where you come from is who you are
* Dress in the style of the wedding's location - If you've always wanted to experiment with a style not popular in your region
* Dress in a conservative

Weddings are often planned around their venues. Grand hotels are more formal than small banquets which are more formal than outdoor picnics. Indoor weddings tend to be more formal that outdoors.  However, but you might be more inclined to wear flannel or boots. 

Selecting footwear is also related to practicality. You don't want to be wearing leather soled shoes to walk on wet-grass and you might not want dress boots if you're in a standing on a beach.

First
&gt;Dry or raw denim

The end. That's it.

* * *

**Raw denim is not necessarily selvage**

For example

Why are the two confused? Because way back in the day all jeans were selvage, hence tend use raw selvedge denim.

**Raw denim will not necessarily shrink to fit**

Raw denim can come sanforized or unsanforized. Sanforized is a fancy way of saying that your denim is pre-shrunk

**Raw denim is not heavier weight than washed denim**

Raw denim comes in all sorts of weights, plenty of washed denim, especially work denim, comes in heavier weights like 15 oz.

Whether heavy weight denim is good or bad is a different story

**Raw denim does not look cleaner/more minimal than washed denim**

I think when you say washed denim, but I think this is a mistake. Yes, raw denim looks very clean and minimal at [first](http://www.highsnobiety.com/files/2012/11/a-beginners-guide-to-raw-denim-2.jpg), but will quickly lose that clean slate look because of the [rapid fading](http://www.highsnobiety.com/files/2012/11/a-beginners-guide-to-raw-denim-3.jpg).

You can buy denim in a [dark wash](http://www.bonobos.com/dark-rinse-slim-straight-leg-denim-for-men-flatiron) which will not fade as fast as raw denim

**Raw denim does not mean higher quality**

Quality can be a very fuzzy thing to talk about. It's important to remember that if you're spending $200 on raw denim and using quality to justify it, $50 Old Navy jeans vs $50 Gap 1969 raw denim, and $200 Adriano Goldschmieds vs $200 APCs is a valid comparison. $50 Old Navy vs $200 APCs is not.

**Raw denim does not imply a better cut or fit**

I feel like this should be obvious

**Raw denim does not mean 100% cotton**

I've seen raw denim with elastane and kevlar blended into it, and I personally find stretch denim to be more comfortable.

* * *

This is not meant to imply raw denim is bad

So what are the benefits of raw denim? Basically

* [High contrast fading](http://denimhunters.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/P1010701.jpg)
* You like the history and authenticity of raw denim

Now, I'm not saying to not get them. Many excellent denim brands do happen to only  produce raw jeans, but recommending Samurais because of their cut and denim quality is a different conversation than recommending them because they're raw.

* To the new guys:

We're basically giving you a 'basic training' version of how to look presentable . Timex, Levi's 514s, etc., are all there to transition you from your graphic-tees-and-my-pants-look-like-dog-shit look to I-can-take-care-of-myself upgrade. There isn't a uniform as much as their is a guide. Yes, 'everyone' here wears 511s/514s, boots, OCBDs, so why complain?

The moment you can branch out to that crazy watch, color matching, and pretty much gain a fashion sense.

* To the regulars and to the guys who hate MFA (this goes hand-in-hand):

First, to praise someone for wearing a Timex (which, in my opinion, are boring) but flame someone for wearing Invicta/Fossil/Diesel. And when I say flame, I mean, **flame**. Not criticize, but (passively) insult the person for straying away from the 'uniform'. You guys have to get out of that mindset.

There's a line between 'sticking to the basics' and 'going out and experiment'. MFA is very strict about that line, ""NO NO! DON'T GO THERE! STAY WITH US WHERE IT IS SAFE!"" 

That is one of the biggest reasons why some people hate MFA-- their fear of risk and want to experiment. Sure, if more people did that, MFA would just accuse them of trying to be Veroz (happened to me, actually). So many people are so afraid of criticism that they end up sticking with the basics and just fill their whole fashion world with the ""MFA basic training uniform"".

**TL;DR**:  Let people experiment, who knows, maybe that 'ugly' watch works perfectly with that outfit.


**UPDATE**: I love how the highest voted comment has nothing to do with the post itself, sometimes I'm an asshole. 


**UPDATE#2**: I've never actually seen a thread explode like this in MFA. I hope a lot of the people who usually don't post spoke up against or with the subject. I'm glad that it sparked the discussion

That was a joke. (;

I understand why many people love raw denim. The quality, it's assumed to be the best - or only - option for denim. Daeus07 said, regarding pre-distressing, in his [fantastic denim guide in the sidebar](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/gtbv4/a_notsoquick_denim_guide/):

&gt; It is almost always far preferable to buy raw jeans and fade them yourself

While I agree you should be wary of most pre-distressing, probably think raw denim is too much of a headache or just don't see the appeal. My goal isn't to bash raw denim, merely to provide information that isn't as readily available on MFA. 

Daeus07 focused primarily on raw denim, fit, and general tips, so I'm going to focus on recommendations for washed denim and trying to fill in any other gaps.

**Washes**

Besides fit

You may have heard some terms thrown around to describe certain washes or techniques - ""stonewashed"", etc. - and while the first two describe real washing techniques, terminology is far less important than how a wash actually looks. One term you should keep in mind is ""pre-distressed"", which refers to jeans being damaged/faded in the factory, usually to make them appear aged or weathered. Jeans that are not pre-distressed, but are washed, will have and usually maintain a fairly uniform color throughout. Depending on the color and shade, while distressed (in-factory or by you) jeans cannot.

Now, but because they're ubiquitous (in the US) and have a large variety.

This - [Levi's](http://us.levi.com/product/index.jsp?productId=11694071&amp;&amp;cp=3146842.3146854.11326986) [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/1U3Lr.jpg) - is a basic, versatile, classic look of raw denim without the raw denim part. For anyone who doesn't want to go down the raw denim road, jeans in this wash should probably make up the majority of the jeans they own.

This - [Levi's](http://us.levi.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2076854&amp;page=3&amp;&amp;cp=3146842.3146845.3699943.17320296) [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/JDApo.jpg) - is a medium to light wash, light-colored jeans that are the typical uniform of the suburban middle-aged. However, they can work, provided they fit well and the rest of your outfit is on point and harmonious. In Americana/workwear styles, I often prefer medium-wash jeans over dark-wash ones. I have similar feelings on this wash: [Levi's](http://us.levi.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2116236&amp;page=3&amp;&amp;cp=3146842.3146845.3699943.17320296) [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/cIX7b.jpg)

These - [Levi's](http://us.levi.com/product/index.jsp?productId=11587058&amp;&amp;cp=3146842.3146854.3691990&amp;fbn=11587058|null|null) [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/k4hFv.jpg) [Levi's](http://us.levi.com/product/index.jsp?productId=12292954&amp;page=3&amp;&amp;cp=3146842.3146845.3699943.17320296&amp;fbn=12292954|null|null) [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/Dxb2v.jpg) [Levi's](http://us.levi.com/product/index.jsp?productId=12905912&amp;cp=3146842.3146845.3699943.17320296&amp;fbn=12905912%7Cnull%7Cnull&amp;clickid=prdsw) [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/ATMLE.jpg) [Levi's](http://us.levi.com/product/index.jsp?productId=12903324&amp;cp=3146842.3146845.3699943.17320086&amp;fbn=12903324%7Cnull%7Cnull&amp;clickid=prdsw) [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/FN7h8.jpg) - are examples of what I find to be bad distressing. It's either overdone or just unattractive. Most jeans sold right now fall into this category. Well-fitting jeans in washes like these will still generally look better than ill-fitting jeans in more attractive washes

These - [Levi's](http://us.levi.com/product/index.jsp?productId=11587057&amp;cp=3146842.3146854.3691990&amp;fbn=12905921|null|null&amp;clickid=prdsw&amp;fbn=11587057|null|null) [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/eg5uv.jpg) [Levi's](http://us.levi.com/product/index.jsp?productId=12330249&amp;page=2&amp;&amp;cp=3146842.3146845.3699943.17320086) [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/gP2fd.jpg) - are examples of the two types of pre-distressing that I like the best. The first type is minimal, I think this kind of distressing looks better than a uniformly dark wash. The second type is jeans that are so light that the distressing fits well and doesn't draw as much attention. As a part of slouchy or grungy looks, - think /u/superhomme and /u/milky_funk - these can look fantastic, especially after some real wear and tear. [**/u/_beacon with an excellent post/inspiration album for light wash denim.**](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1azxxy/light_wash_denim_a_history_and_collection_of/)

There are, including colors. Grey or black denim is fairly easy to incorporate for most people and can even look okay slightly distressed. For colors beyond those two, I would stick to non-distressed and only wear them casually.

**Brand recommendations**

I'm modelling this off the same section in Daeus07's guide. The price ranges, but if it makes sense for you, [the option is available](http://www.walmart.com/ip/11037736?adid=22222222227000046673&amp;wmlspartner=wlpa&amp;wl0=&amp;wl1=g&amp;wl2=&amp;wl3=21486607510&amp;wl4=&amp;wl5=pla&amp;veh=sem). Also, it's worth noting, unlike with raw denim, washed denim is available at basically every clothing store anywhere. [$30 Kohl's jeans](http://www.kohls.com/product/prd-514447/sonoma-lifestyle-straight-leg-jeans.jsp) can't hold a candle to $30 (on sale) Levi's, but they're there. The brands I'm including here are all ones I consider good value at their respective price points.

*Super low end tier (&lt;$25)*

* Old Navy's slim fit jeans fit surprisingly well. I'm 5'9"" 130, a little better than typical Old Navy. [Link.](http://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do?cid=55506&amp;vid=1&amp;pid=776324002) The ""dark rigid"" wash falls into the first category listed above and is a good choice (it's what I own), while the distressing on the ""medium wash"" looks acceptably subtle. [**Link**](http://www.oldnavy.com/products/mens-jeans.jsp)

* Lee is good quality for the money, I've been impressed by the quality of the denim and construction. Their downfall is their generally terrible fits and washes. If you're a bigger guy, their regular fit is a bit snugger than the Levi's 501 I've found and would be a solid option. It comes in a huge variety of washes, some of which aren't bad at all. They have some slim fits, closer to a 513 or 514 than 511, but the washes are usually pretty bad. If you find one you like and are more of a 514 guy in terms of fit, I think it's great value. [**Link**](http://www.lee.com/store/LEE_STORE_US/en_US/category/men/jeans.html)

*Mid-tier ($25-$50)*

* Uniqlo - ~~Denim is Chinese

* H&amp;M - Along with their outerwear, which is a somewhat common complaint. If you have that complaint at H&amp;M, I don't know how your body is still alive. [**Link**](http://www.hm.com/us/subdepartment/MEN?Nr=4294956231)

* Zara and value/quality rarely go together

*Levi's tier (mostly $35-$60)*

* You knew it was coming. Levi's is the name of the game in washed denim. You will find a cut that flatters you - 511 for slim people, in my opinion - and you will find a wash that you like. One issue with Levi's is possible quality variance, discussed [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/12wwrh/levis_quality_variance_could_it_be_true/c6yyllx) and [here](http://i.imgur.com/qui7z.png). It's cliched at this point, but Levi's is probably the best value in denim (raw notwithstanding) as long as you're not limited to the super low-end or interested in exceptional quality. [**Link**](http://us.levi.com/family/index.jsp?categoryId=3699943&amp;cp=3146842.3146845&amp;ab=leftnav:shopothercategories:jeans(seeallmens):3699943)

*I don't like Levi's for some reason (or I'm European and they're super expensive; sorry!) tier ($60-$100)*

* I've had good experiences with Gap denim ($60-$80). A variety of fits and washes, but if you prefer the fit and available washes and you catch it on sale, it's a good option. I know it might pain denim enthusiasts to see people spending as much as they would on a pair of Unbranded jeans on a pair of average-quality washed jeans, though. [**Link**](http://www.gap.com/products/mens-jeans.jsp)

* Twitchshooter put in a good word for J. Crew denim. Variety of good cuts

*I care a lot about denim but apparently not raw denim tier (&gt;$100)*

At this point, not at all. Unlike with raw denim, it's tough to determine whether you're paying more for better quality. It's usually not that you're just paying for the name, but I would have to really be in love with a fit, wash, or certain details to shell out this kind of money for washed denim. 

* Levi's Vintage Clothing has a lot of unique reproductions that are great quality. Some raw

* Acne is more on the high-fashion side of things. They have a great skinny fit, some terrible, some not. [**Link**](http://shop.acnestudios.com/shop/men/jeans-1.html)

* RRL, raw and washed. They're one of the only brands I've seen that has made good-looking jeans with over-the-top distressing. [**Link**](http://www.ralphlauren.com/shop/index.jsp?categoryId=11757743)

* Simon Miller is a designer whose jeans I've only seen at Barney's. Made in the US

* Nudie (suggested by Cameronrgr) is best known on MFA for its raw denim

* J Brand

* Givenchy

* Rag &amp; Bone

* Burberry (primarily Brit and London lines; thanks Iampresto)

* Neighborhood (suggested by Cameronrgr)

* Visvim (suggested by Cameronrgr)

* Dior (suggested by Cameronrgr)

* Evisu (courtesy of Nasi_lemak)

* G-Star (courtesy of Nasi_lemak)

* Robert Geller (courtesy of Superhomme)

* Japanese brands (courtesy of Superhomme): Nonnative, Sophnet, Wtaps.

* Other brands known for pre-washed denim (varying quality) (big thanks to Iampresto): Hudson, AG, Earnest Sewn, Dolce and Gabbana, DSQUARED2, Citizens of Humanity, John Varvatos, True Religion, Joe's, Cult of Individuality

I could continue to list brands

The navy boat shoes are almost sold out, unfortunately, but there are most sizes still available in the other colors.  For something more sneaker-ey, [these Sperry-CVO-knockoffs](http://canvas.landsend.com/pp/StylePage-393321_X5.html?amp;CM_MERCH=REC-_-CVPP-_-GGT-_-2-_-393321-_-401124) are $21.97, available in tan and navy in a bunch of sizes, and will still qualify you for free shipping.  Put some rawhide leather laces in them to steal a look from the J.Crew summer catalog.

As an alternative (since the updated LE code doesn't have a minimum order anymore), [these Old Navy slim-fit polos](http://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do?cid=26068&amp;vid=1&amp;pid=898381) are $9, and a wide range of colors.

**What is silhouette?**

Silhouette is a French term and, an object or scene represented as a solid shape of a single colour, usually black, its edges matching the outline of the subject... Because a silhouette emphasises the outline, the word has also been used in the fields of fashion and fitness to describe the shape of a person's body or the shape created by wearing clothing of a particular style or period.""

Pretty simple. But it's one of the most fundamental aspects of fashion and something you should be aware of when putting together an outfit. Fit is how a piece of clothing fits your body

[This image](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Coronet_Corset_Co.gif) from Wikipedia shows how the exact same outfit can be changed in a pretty big way just by altering the silhouette.

**Why should I care about my silhouette?**

Your silhouette is what you would see if you took the color

**Can you please just tell me how to have a good silhouette?**

It's not that simple, or want a basic introduction of how silhouettes are applied fashion, read on.

I have taken four fits (black tie, [two](http://i.imgur.com/eNahJK5.jpg), [three](http://i.imgur.com/X2mAf4X.jpg), and [four](http://i.imgur.com/vfdlZt3.jpg). Can you figure out which is which? Which one do you like best?

[Here](http://imgur.com/eNahJK5,vfdlZt3,apZUE4u,cXByce9,dduO9Vx,W4MZSYH) is an album with the four silhouettes you just saw and the original images. Are you surprised by any of the fits? Did you like one outfit in the silhouette but change your mind when you saw the real thing? How about the other way around? What specifically did you like or dislike about the silhouettes? Let's take a closer look at each of the fits.

*Note: Do not underestimate the value of blacking out a fit as a tool to help you critique fits and develop your style.*

* [Black tie](http://imgur.com/vfdlZt3

Look at the blacked out picture. If you frequently wear suits, the collar provides a nice transition to his head. If you could see his shoes (oxfords or slippers for black tie) you would see that they provide a sleek look to his feet and the pants would taper down slightly, giving a nice clean line from hips to feet. There is a reason formalwear and suits have not changed much in the 20th century, and the silhouette has a lot to do with it.

When you look at the real picture

* [Formal](http://imgur.com/eNahJK5

Look at the blacked out picture. There's not much new here. It's a bit of a slimmer cut

When you go to the real picture, all the pieces are working in different ways than in black tie. This is all covered in other guides on the sidebar ([Here is the suit guide.](http://redd.it/e96hr)) But the silhouette is largely the same. The biggest difference between a suit and tuxedo is the freedom you have in color and texture. I love the trousers, I'm not a fan of the socks or checked shirt, but you have no idea of these things looking at the silhouette. They don't contribute or detract from the overall shape.

If you only wear suits

* [Business Casual] (http://imgur.com/74pJhQf

Look at the blacked out picture. Things are getting a little more interesting now. Look at the pockets on his jacket. Look at how much more they bulge out than in the previous two pictures. He doesn't look as svelt as the guys in suits and tuxedos. But it's also obvious that they are big chunky pockets and not just wide hips. Look at how the popped collar leads from the shoulders to the head in a more exaggerated way. But the fit of the shoulders

Look at the real picture. Were you surprised by the material of the blazer? That he was wearing a sweater? 

* [Casual](http://imgur.com/X2mAf4X

Look at the blacked out picture. This is about as simple as you can get in menswear. The clothing he is wearing is doing almost nothing to alter the shape of his body. You have his shoes making his feet look nice and some stacking in the pants

Look at the real picture. He looks like a regular person, I just want you to take note of what a minimalistic silhouette looks like in menswear. Sometimes doing nothing special with a fit is as much of a statement as doing something ridiculous.

**How can I avoid a bad silhouette?**

It's pretty simple

*OK so that's basically it. I hope you learned some stuff about how your silhouette works with menswear and that you can start to become more aware of it as you develop your style.*

**That's it? I thought we were going to talk about how to explore silhouettes. I want to stand out in my office.**

Sadly, but any drastic change in your silhouette and you're not wearing a suit anymore and therefore can't wear it to the office. If you want to stand out in menswear, you're going to have to work with color and texture and leave your silhouette alone. Any example I've seen of someone wearing formal wear with a fresh silhouette is working in an environment where they have freedom to dress how they want and a suit is not required anyway. Nick Wooster does a pretty good job of keeping it business-y I guess, but he mainly plays with color and texture. You can do little things with business casual like chunky sweaters and cuffed chinos, maybe some bulky Doc Martens, but again it depends on how flexible your dress code is. *If anyone has examples of formal wear with cool silhouettes, please feel free to comment and I'll add them.* The bright side to all this is that the silhouette for menswear is very flattering and aesthetically pleasing

**OK

Thanks for reading! Good luck with those TPS reports!


**Have the menswear guys left yet? Good.**

The biggest problem with the silhouette in menswear is that it's *boring.* I mean

**How can I create interesting silhouettes?**

Simple: start to look for them. Start becoming aware of the silhouettes you see online and in real life. Start to think about how you can incorporate the things you like into your style. The idea that your silhouette should flatter and accentuate your body is sound

I mean, boots, high waisted pants, that is fantastic.

[This one is really cool too.](http://store.canyonrecords.com/biopics/William_Horncloud_color.jpg) If I were to black this one out you'd have a hard time telling it was human. [This is a simple one.](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lxzhndiKyp1qipvddo1_500.jpg) Look at how the turban changes the whole shape of the head, notice the asymmetry.

Regardless of how historically accurate those images were, as long as you realize that all silhouettes are arbitrary on some level. You can say that you have thought critically about the piece and still do not like the aesthetics of the garment, and that is all a part of your own style. *If you do not care to try and push the boundaries of silhouette, you can stick with menswear and that is just fine too.*

That said

**How can I explore silhouettes in modern fashion?**

Learning about silhouettes is the thing that got me interested in designer fashion to begin with. The first thing you have to realize is that (for the most part) fashion designers are not creating outfits that they expect to see you wearing on the street tomorrow. They are demonstrating *ideas* that they hope to see you incorporate into your style tomorrow. 

[Take a look at Yohji Yamamoto.](http://i.imgur.com/rOG67iq.jpg) That outfit is not too ridiculous, and they end abruptly into combat boots. Look at how much longer the jacket is than a standard blazer, and the whole thing is looser and baggier than the suits we looked at earlier. Yohji is not looking svelt and slim and sleek. He's looking baggy and chunky. [Here's another picture of him.](http://www.egodesign.ca/_files/articles/548d_yohji_yamamoto__zinedine_zidane.jpg) Again, baggy and billowy. Yohji tends to bring some of that ancient Japanese look into his clothing, you see how the billowy silhouettes you just saw reflect the shapes of the Japanese clothing that I linked to earlier.

[I know you've heard of Rick Owens](http://i122.photobucket.com/albums/o250/Handlethevibe/RickOwens-1.jpg). [Here's another](http://blog.needsupply.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/rick6.jpg). [And a third](http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2009/5/6/1241606001804/Rick-Owens-in-Paris-001.jpg). Look at how he plays with a minimalistic top and pairs it with a chunky bottom (first picture)

I could continue, Ann Demeulemeester, Alexander Wang or Maison Martin Margiela. Remember, you don't have to wear $1,000 shoes to be into designer fashion, you just need to think about what the designer is doing to the outfit and (if you like it) how you can incorporate that idea into your wardrobe. Maybe you decide Geobaskets are really cool, but since you can't afford them you find that Supra makes some stuff that would work for you for a cheaper price. Maybe you like Yohji's billowy pants so you go to Wal-Mart and buy some 5XL trousers and tailor them into your own cool billowy pants. The possibilities are endless once you start looking and exploring.

[Finally

I hope this has been educational and instructional and I hope you have enjoyed reading it as much as I have enjoyed writing it.

**White usually meant lighter fabrics**

&gt;One common explanation is practical. For centuries,"" says Judith Martin, better known as etiquette columnist Miss Manners. ""And white is of a lighter weight.""

**White was symbolic for leisure**
&gt;other historians speculate, you'll see people in dark clothes,"" says Scheips, many scurrying to their jobs. By contrast, he adds, the white linen suits and Panama hats at snooty resorts were ""a look of leisure.""

White pants are often described as a preppy, as white pants can be hard to pull off in other ""styles."" The only other way that I've seen it done frequently is in the hip-hop scene. [Kanye West](http://imgur.com/tf0K6iT) tries it here, for those that are fans of him.

**The Look**
 

Although white might seem to be an incredibly versatile color (white tees can go with anything), [2](http://imgur.com/TyMUd2y), [3](http://imgur.com/Hqv73Ku), [4](http://imgur.com/ymvwv2O), [5](http://imgur.com/zOWGX55).


**Note**

It is difficult to have nothing dark to contrast with the white pants and still pull them off. Usually, dark sunglasses/hair/skin tone can all break up the wall of color if done correctly. This look is not as safe, but still provides sufficient contrast to not seem too washed-out. Notice the subtle navy trim, coupled with a tan skin tone, sunglasses, and dark hair [here](http://imgur.com/bx8D7VK). This [man](http://i.imgur.com/NSx6JW5.jpg), despite wearing rather faint colors, although this is about as minimal in terms of contrast that you should get. Here is an example of someone looking [washed out](http://imgur.com/2V0j697), for those wondering). Oh

**Fabrics**

The three most common fabrics for white pants are linen
Of these, often leading to revealing of undergarments/tucked-in shirts, etc. White chinos are better suited for the summer weather and denim is generally reserved for fall/winter looks, although white denim and white chinos are virtually indistinguishable unless you are up close. 

**Where can I buy white pants?**

The easiest and well-fitting option in my opinion is Levi's 511 or 514 in white
Other options include:

 * Two pairs of [patterned twill shorts](http://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do?cid=45495&amp;vid=1&amp;pid=115871&amp;scid=115871002), because it's worth trying these on first and free shipping from the website doesn't kick in until $50).   The cotton twill fabric keeps them from looking too much like board shorts.  Of the three patterns, I'm a big fan of blue floral and green floral, with hibiscus in distant third.  I don't like the palm trees at all - too close to a board short pattern, in my opinion.  For what it's worth, I also like the [chambray shorts](http://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do?cid=45495&amp;vid=1&amp;pid=897377&amp;scid=897377012) and the [linen camp shorts](http://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do?cid=45495&amp;vid=1&amp;pid=112163&amp;scid=112163012), which are only $12.  These are 8"" inseam shorts, they also sell [madras prints](http://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do?cid=45495&amp;vid=1&amp;pid=897377&amp;scid=897377062) in tall sizes (12"" inseams) for the same price.   I think it's worth giving the 8"" inseams a shot, at least on me.)

 * [Two long-sleeve button-downs in poplin](http://canvas.landsend.com/pp/the-heritage-patterned-poplin~211462_-1.html?bcc=y&amp;action=order_more&amp;sku_0=::CO7&amp;CM_MERCH=IDX_sale-_-men-_-shirts&amp;origin=index), lightweight cotton, and with the sleeves rolled at or above your elbow, these are going to be just as cool as short-sleeve polos or tees.   Lands' End Canvas shirts run a little big, so if you're between sizes, go down.  If you can swing it, order two different sizes and return the one that doesn't fit to any Sears store.    

 * [A pair of espadrilles](http://www.soludos.com/shop-men), but [Put This On has recommended them a bunch](http://putthison.com/tagged/Espadrilles) (and [in a ""Summer Style on the Cheap"" post here too](http://putthison.com/post/5043780944/the-five-days-of-summer-series-part-v-summer)) so it's hard to call them too feminine.  [The guys at Street Etiquette have also written about espadrilles](http://streetetiquette.com/2010/08/13/summer-etiquette-espadrilles/), and [they've shown up on MFA before too](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/ukbcu/any_thoughts_on_espadrilles/).   [I also put together a quick image gallery of some shots I like.](http://imgur.com/a/Hzttp)  I linked to Soludos espadrilles above because they're pretty cheap and come in a really wide range of colors (although I'd probably stick to the basics - white, off-white, navy or grey, in canvas, linen or chambray).  [RopeySoles make another affordable option](http://ropeysoles.com/mens_product_page.php?item_code=MESimple01) (about $30, and so does [Drilleys](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=sr_nr_n_1?rh=n%3A672123011%2Cp_4%3ADrilleys%2Cn%3A!672124011%2Cn%3A679255011&amp;bbn=672124011&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1340026321&amp;rnid=672124011).  You can even go really cheap with the [$16 espadrilles at Asos](http://us.asos.com/search/espadrilles?hrd=1&amp;q=espadrilles#state=Rf-700%3D1001%40Rf-400%3D53&amp;parentID=-1&amp;pge=1&amp;pgeSize=20&amp;sort=-1) (especially since shipping is free), they were historically shoes you'd buy from a cheap street vendor.

(*Please message me if your image is featured in any of these articles and you would like it removed*)

Since 2006

Despite its modicum of popularity on other forums, or how the class system works.  I've done some reading but I'm far from being an expert.  You should start with some core Goth Ninja reading from SZ:

* [**Johnny**'s 9 points of Style Philosophy](http://stylezeitgeist.com/forums/showpost.php?p=12344&amp;postcount=22)
* [A big thread on ""Where to Start."" **Fuuma** discusses Finding your Style and **Faust** discusses brands and value](http://stylezeitgeist.com/forums/showthread.php?t=3064)
* [**Faust** on brands
* [**Servo2000**'s post on the authenticity of a fashion item](http://www.stylezeitgeist.com/forums/showpost.php?p=95434&amp;postcount=9093)

One of the things which makes Goth Ninja difficult is intentional obfuscation of the rules - Goth Ninjas are intentionally vague about how the game is played because there is a capped maximum amount of exp that exists in the game at one time.  That means if lower level players level up then higher level players lose exp.  Sharing information about Goth Ninja also hurts individual players working one of the major leveling activities: kopping high-tier items from new brands before they are discovered.

While there are plenty of retail sites where people kop GN gear, superfuture classifieds, yahoo.co.jp auctions, global.rakuten.com, ebay.com, etc.  You can also find shitty, leftover loot on Yoox... Yoox is the leftover loot from other instances and sometimes you can find high-level items but when you do you usually can't get as good a discount on them because they are likely to get snatched up quick by other players.

One of the biggest accomplishments in Goth Ninja is to acquire a grail.  That is, like in other MMOs, a lot of the high level players got there with the help of Chinese gold farmers.

Enough about general gameplay.  Here's a guide to classes:

**[Low Level Characters](http://imgur.com/a/qmYTG)** have not acquired enough exp to use heavy armor.  Heavy armor is associated with a higher encumbrance

**[Fighters](http://imgur.com/a/SPTzw)** typically wear light

**[Shamans](http://imgur.com/a/Lyy0U)** are identifiable by their drapey cloth armor.  

**[Rogues](http://imgur.com/a/cShpz)** are a common choice of class for advanced players.  They can be identified by their slim leather jackets and display their character level through the amount of stacking in their sleeves and pants - the greater the stack

**[Sorcerers](http://imgur.com/a/OPkiW)** have widely varying levels of encumbrance.   They are stereotyped by their slim button downs and dress jackets that emphasize long sleeves.

**[Druids](http://imgur.com/a/s4WCq)** are a popular class for characters who grind in cold environments.  Druids can be identified by their armor which creates a massive torso and slim leg silhouette.

**[Warlocks](http://imgur.com/a/w50Mh)** are easily identified by their massive

I hope some of you guys have a better sense of how this sprawling

###Red Wing Iron Ranger
---

##Pros

The Iron Rangers get a lot of love and for good reason too. These boots are meant to take a good beating. Being from Minnesota
  
The leather on these boots feels solid and substantial. The leather is stiff for the first few weeks but they break in nicely and without too much pain. They only took a few wears to really break in for me and I was usually wearing wool socks so it wasn’t a big deal. It’s funny when you start to compare low quality boots vs. a well constructed boot. I own an old pair of Timberland Earthkeeps and the different between any of these boots is night and day.

##Cons
Although I wore them in Minnesota winters, it is hardly noticeable unlike a lot of the side view pictures that you may see of the toe box. I haven’t had great experience with the default laces they provide staying tied, even with double knots. Perhaps I just suck at tying shoes, which is entirely possible. 

---
###Red Wing Beckman
---

##Pros
Much like all work boots, it was a great option for traversing snow or rain. 
  
Just like the Iron Rangers

##Cons
Once again, the Beckman is a weird spot. They’re kind of dressy and kind of work-bootish too. I don’t know if this would be considered a con or a pro since I suppose depending on how you dress, they could go either way. Personally, I would rather have it reside in one clear category which I think would be “work boot”. The only other thing I would mention is that the leather on these is pretty “shiny” when you first get them. I hesitate to put this as a con because that shine begins to diminish the more you wear them (which I liked).

---
###Wolverine Addison 1000 Mile
---

##Pros
I know it may be an unpopular opinion, wool pants, or jeans. The wingtip accents and leather sole give it a dressed up enough look that they can get by with my current style. Another point that I think was mentioned a few days ago was that the 1000 Mile boots are significantly lighter than the Iron Rangers and the Beckmans. This makes them much more comfortable for wearing for an entire day walking around the city. I think I get many more compliments on my Addisons than my Iron Ranger or Beckmans combined. The leather is incredibly soft and really has that genuine feel. The leather on the IR and Beckman are obviously a little more rough while the Addison feels less treated and more natural.

##Cons
I really like the waxed laces on these but they’re either not too durable or I’m too rough when tightening my shoes. The laces have started to fray which isn’t that big of a deal. I’ve heard they’ll send you new laces for free too if you email them. Since the leather is soft

Through Monday or so

 *  [A pair of Keds from the $19 sale](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/oqd0t/keds_winter_shoes_sale_anything_worth_the_price/).  There are a lot of good options in white, brown, olive, and red still available, including [a pair designed by Mark McNairy](http://www.keds.com/store/SiteController/keds/productdetails?catId=cat610201&amp;productId=5-173480&amp;skuId=***5********MF39606*M085&amp;stockNumber=MF39606&amp;showDefaultOption=true&amp;subCatId=cat610241&amp;subCatTabId=cat1290406&amp;viewall=) ( ~~although I wouldn't be surprised if these are gone before tomorrow morning~~ Sure enough!).

Free shipping if you use KEDSBDAY2011 or KEDSWELCOME2011.

 * A pair of [Levi's 514s in the Tumbled Rigid finish](http://www.amazon.com/Levis-Straight-Premium-Tumbled-38x30/dp/B005OUICQU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327183845&amp;sr=8-1) for $40.  Slim-straight fit that's not actually very slim below the knee.  511s would be a better option if you're thin.  These are available at mid-tier department stores everywhere (JC Penney, etc), so go try some on.  They're perpetually on sale, so they'll probably be the same price in the store.  Free super-saver shipping if you order from Amazon though.

 * A half-dozen of the [$7 v-neck t-shirts from the current Lands' End Canvas sale](http://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/opbis/lands_end_canvas_7_crewsvnecks/).  Get half of them in neutral colors (gray, and half in brighter colors (red, yellow, green).

LEC runs slightly large, so consider sizing down from what you normally wear.  If you have a Sears near you, it's possible they'll have these in stock.  Free shipping if you use FREEZE (pin 1710), and no-questions-asked returns at that same Sears store.

This sale lasts through Monday, so you'd have a chance to try their shorts on if you want to - note that they're unlikely to have the 8"" pairs in most stores, meaning a pair tagged 32"" will actually measure 34"" in the waist

The guide is divided into two main sections:

&gt;**I. The Basics - Fit

&gt;**II. The Styles - From Shorts to Wool Trousers**

----

**I. The Basics**

 * ***Fit*** - Before you ever think about color, pants should stay up without needing a belt or suspenders, and they should follow the line of your legs.  For some guys, that's going to mean straight-leg pants, for others, that'll mean slim or skinny pants - but don't let the name get in the way of the fit.  Levi's 514 cut, for example, but thin guys will find themselves swimming in them.  I'd also advise you not to get hung up on the tagged waist size, (2) order from somewhere with an excellent exchange policy, [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/py3zf/my_girlfriend_thinks_bootcut_jeans_are_better/)

 *  ***Materials*** - Some folks use ""khakis"" and ""chinos"" interchangeably, and Momotaro (a high-end Japanese denim company) [argues that Zimbabwean cotton is the best](http://momotaro.fr/m1.htm).  If you'd rather wear pants that were walking around a field instead of growing in it, wool is a textile made from the magical coats of sheep.  In general, you'll want to stick with natural fibers (100% cotton, linen, or wool) over (1) synthetic blends, where a percentage of the weave is made up of a man-made material like polyester or spandex, like nylon.  (Note that this isn't the case for pants you might wear for athletics or other outdoor activities - running tights

 *  ***Construction Details &amp; Terminology*** - *Pleats* are the [sewn-in folds of fabric at the waist of some trousers.](http://i.imgur.com/KRWkb.jpg)  In almost every case and unless you have a large, and they're generally found on more formal trousers. Creases often look out of place on casual chinos, and they're definitely a no-no for jeans.  *Rise* is a word to describe [measurement C on this chart.](http://i.imgur.com/YtVmU.jpg)  You'll generally find higher rises on dressier trousers and lower rises on pants you're less likely to tuck shirts into, like jeans and casual chinos.   *Break* refers to [the amount of fabric that's folding when your pants sit on top of your shoes.](http://www.effortlessgent.com/the-break-how-to-choose-the-best-pants-length-how-to-tell-your-tailor/)  Cuffs are [a sewn-in, permanent fold at the bottom of some trousers.](http://www.realmenrealstyle.com/dress-pants-cuffs-no-cuffs/)  Note that cuffs are different than simply rolling or folding up the bottom of chinos or jeans.  For the front pockets, the four main styles are on-seam, off-seam (or ""slash""), you're looking at trouser pockets, but many jeans (especially raw and shrink-to-fit) and some casual chinos have button flies.  Most casual pants will have a standard waist button

**II.  The Styles - From Most to Least Casual**

 * *Shorts* -  From the spring/summer guide:  Look for simple, depending on how tall you are). You won’t go wrong with tan or khaki, but navy and light gray are good choices too. If your style is a little more preppy, then yellow, light blue, madras and seersucker are on the table. J.Crew, Lands’ End, there's a detailed infographic on shorts [here](http://i.imgur.com/gdN5C.jpg)

 * *Jeans* - There's already an incredibly thorough denim guide in the sidebar, non-distressed wash.  No bootcut - ever.  Selvage is sometimes, but not always, a sign of quality.  If you're wearing raw/dry denim, wash is as infrequently as possible (6 months to a year between washes isn't uncommon).  At the low end, Levi's are a good choice since they make a wide variety of fits, they're available to try on everywhere, they're also good sources for affordable denim, you're generally looking at either Japanese or US-made jeans from retailers like Self-Edge

 * *Canvas ""duck"" pants* - Pants made from heavyweight canvas fabric.  The are basically blue collar work pants, Naked &amp; Famous makes both [Weird Guys](http://www.denimgeek.com/jeans-c19/tapered-jeans-c9/naked-famous-jeans-weirdguy-selvedge-duck-p81) and Slim Guys in selvage canvas duck.  

 * *Cords* - I've been surprised to find out that corduroy pants are kind of divisive on MFA - some people strongly associate them with being dressed by their mothers as a little boy.  That's not my experience at all, you'll want to look for a relatively [fine-wale cord,](http://i.imgur.com/ICEjk.jpg) although a [chunky wide-wale cord](http://i.imgur.com/bsDmX) can look great in the fall or winter with a big, heavy sweater.

**I. Rules for Acceptable Posts and Comments:**

----

----

 * Any post that isn't requesting or giving advice will be removed. ""Giving advice"" is interpreted broadly to include inspiration albums

 * Personal attacks, gender, body type or other social profile are *strictly* prohibited. Comments will be removed and repeated offenses will result in being banned from MFA.

 * Joke posts are not allowed (especially joke images, comics, rageposts, advice animals, etc).

 * No sale/coupon announcements (""30% off clearance at J.Crew!"") or personal sales (""$25 OBO on this pair slightly-used Levi's 511s"").  Please visit /r/frugalmalefashion instead.

 * While most marketing efforts are prohibited on MFA, corporate giveaways, special MFA discounts, personal kickstarter campaigns, and others) must be cleared with the mods first.

 * It's fine to post pictures of yourself or public figures/celebrities


----

**II. How to Ask for Advice: Guidelines and Best Practices**

----

----

 * Use the MFA search bar and look through the appropriate sections of the sidebar and/or [wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/wiki/index) before posting.  You don't need to read through the entire library to ask a simple question

 * Use clear, and find [this guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/15v5ya/hirokis_mfa_guide_to_sweatshirts/) and [this review thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/182owa/mfa_reviews_thread_27_sweatshirts/) that already have lengthy, detailed answers!  

 * Strongly consider making a self-post (""Submit a new text post"") instead of a photo link.  Particularly avoid photo links titled ""How'd I do"" or ""What can I change"".  They are the worst type of low-effort posts and

 * In the body of your self-post/text-post, age, body type, personal style, and what event or context you're dressing for (work, wedding, college party, while specific questions receive useful

 * If you ask for criticism, for example, or your choice of shoes in a question about a pair of pants you just bought).  Sometimes these will be useful and sometimes they will not, but keep an open mind.

I split it into casual and office/professional

Overall

For the clothes you’ll be putting away for a while, and invest in some canvas bags, plastic bins, and cedar balls.  I also like to use the change in seasons as motivation to go through and donate what I didn’t wear.  Don't put a sweater or coat you didn’t wear all winter into storage - donate it.

**I.  Spring/Summer Casual**

April/May is the time to put away: heavy coats/parkas, cords.

The basic casual wardrobe:

 * **Shorts** – Look for simple, depending on how tall you are).  You won’t go wrong with tan or khaki, but navy and light gray are good choices too.  If your style is a little more preppy, then yellow, light blue, madras and seersucker are on the table too.  J.Crew, Lands’ End, simple

 * **Shoes** – Probably deserves a separate post of its own, Jack Purcells, Tretorns, Keds, Spring Courts, Sperry CVO, SeaVees, boat shoes, driving mocs, make sure the sandals *and* your feet are clean.   If you’re starting from scratch

 * **Shirts** – Fit is incredibly important.  You generally won’t be layering a sweater or jacket, green, pink) are standard, but make sure they fit well.  The hem should hit just below your belt (no longer than the middle of your fly) and the sleeves shouldn’t go much beyond the middle of your bicep.  Treat polos like a tiny step above a t-shirt.  They shouldn’t ever be tucked in, and never button the top button.  Don’t pop the collar unless you can look down and verify that you’re on a boat.  If you don’t mind logos, Ralph Lauren Polo custom-fit shirts are fantastic.  For logo-less polos (which I personally prefer), Lands’ End, H&amp;M and J.Crew are good choices.  [Kent Wang](http://www.kentwang.com/) is the master of logo-free polos, linen) and avoid cheap non-iron shirts because they don’t breathe well and it’ll be like wearing a poncho.  

 * **Pants** – Look for lightweight, nantucket red – which are really kind of washed-out pink – green, yellow, bright blue, etc.).  Unless you're really masochistic, this might be the time to put away those 22oz Flathead jeans you've been breaking in.  Naked &amp; Famous have made some 8-10oz summer-weight jeans the last couple years, and I'm sure they'll do it again.
 
 * **Sunglasses** – Also probably deserves a post of its own.  I like the classics – Wayfarers, but I’m terrible at not losing or breaking them, so I just buy cheap ones from a kiosk at the mall.  They have worse optics because they have polycarbonate lenses instead of glass, but provide just as much UV protection.    

 * **Hats** – If you’re going to wear a hat, white or red.
  
 * **Jackets** - Almost anywhere you live, classic color – red, yellow, navy, kelly green.    

 * **Sweaters** – I like to have a sweater or two for cool evenings, and bright colors (yellow, green, blue, pink) are easy to get away with in the summer.
  
 * **Avoid (or if you already own them, wraparound sport sunglasses (unless you’re currently engaged in that sport at that very moment), pleated shorts, baggy cargo shorts, capris, grungy flip-flops/sandals, short-sleeve button-up shirts ([although this is controversial](http://tinyurl.com/72kzz5e)), tank-tops (unless you’re at the pool or beach)

For some visual examples, [this](http://i.imgur.com/PTLBE.jpg) and [the guy on the right here](http://i.imgur.com/Wrlru.jpg)are all solid spring/summer looks.  (A lot of interest in the guy in the green shirt/white pants.  It's a J.Crew catalog shot from a couple years ago, and everything it out of stock.  You should be able to find a similar green madras, white jeans, and suede Top-siders through other retailers though.)

**II. Spring/Summer Office/Professional**

April/May is the time to put away:  Wool/flannel suits in 4-season fabric, sweaters, ties with heavy patterns and textures (wool, flannel, tartan)  

The basic office wardrobe:

 * **Suits/Jackets** – If you don’t own a khaki or navy cotton suit, but that’s going to turn some heads unless you’re in New England or the south (and probably even then too).  A seersucker jacket is less ostentatious than the full suit.   Otherwise, look for three-season wool, and opt for lighter colors (light- to mid-gray in particular).

 * **Shoes** – Not much will change with the season here, light-colored shoes (tan loafers/wingtips, or white/tan suede bucks) are completely appropriate.

 * **Shirts** – Summer-weight cotton

 * **Ties** – Lightweight silk &amp; knits, seersucker. Bright (but not ridiculous) colors are more acceptable in spring and summer than fall/winter.  If your style leans toward preppy New England-ish, this is the time to break out the summer-themed emblematics (lobsters, whales anchors, etc).  In some offices, summers are tie-optional.  If you've got the chest to do it, open an extra button when you go tie-less.  

In my mind

So far this week we've had people trying to get advice on how pull off the punk look
           

Everytime someone makes a thread about how their urban/street/casual style is unappreciated here and then they post a pic of themselves, in fact most of the time theres no apparent *style* at all. Sometimes they are looking for advice on how to dress better and thats okay, but you have to make that clear. It's when people post their dorm-style and then when given **legitimate** criticism they respond with ""yeah, but I'm more into urban/street style and I know MFA can't/won't appreciate it"".
      

I assure you that our lack of appreciation for street style is not because we cannot appreciate you're unique style sensibilities but because there have been next to no good examples of it and just a lot of whining about all the advice given to people who want to dress in chinos, quality **still** matters, patterns, colours, sizing, matching, and overall look **still** matter.
Style is intentional and its universal

When someone posted [this picture](http://i.imgur.com/uG5JG.png) and asked why dressing like this is wrong

&gt;I find this sort of submission to be something like submitting a picture of a ham sandwich to a gourmet subreddit and then challenging as to why it's not gathering any traction with that subreddit's members. It's not that the ham sandwich is bad in any way
Sure, but to instantly revert to the standard clothes that you're accustomed to, then you're not really asking for advice, you're asking for acceptance.
And this subreddit isn't designed to provide comfort in your style
To sum up with the sandwich analogy: a ham sandwich isn't bad

This post is the compromise I came up with.  

I figured that most dudes looking to drop $500 for spring/summer gear have their bases covered already, you don't need a thread like this.  A sticky conundrum-22 if there ever was. 

So I put together a $500 *Expansion* Kit that assumes you have spring/summer basics covered, but still focused on versatility and value.  This kit is eight items, all of which can be worn with just about everything else in the kit, which means there's something like two dozen different combinations here.  Add it to the spring/summer staples you already have and it's an incredibly versatile, non-boring wardrobe.

I recommend Red Rose and Union Blue if you want to go really bold, Deep Cedar and Deep Cobalt for something not quite as in-your-face but still nontraditional.  Buy them one inseam shorter than you usually would for the no-break look.

**Total: $490.00 (plus some shipping charges)**

I want to reiterate that this kit assumes you have the spring/summer basics covered.  If you don't already have lightweight chinos in neutral colors, boat shoes, plimsolls, etc, etc, etc, then those are a priority over all this nonsense.

* Yes to: leather upper
* No to: square toe, metal bits
* Outdoor/all purpose: rubber/Vibram sole
* Indoor/dress: leather sole
* If your grandfather wouldn't have worn them


**—Quick recommendations**

**—Boot features**

The sole is probably the most important part of a boot. Materials are

* [Leather](http://imgur.com/a/SJeF7#8): dress and fashion boots; good all-around but terrible in rain/snow/ice. Lightest weight.
* [Crepe](http://imgur.com/a/SJeF7#5): same pros/cons as leather
* [Cork](http://imgur.com/a/SJeF7#4): like rubber; hard-wearing and decent traction
* [Rubber/Vibram](http://imgur.com/a/SJeF7#15): most work boots

And forms include

* [Flat](http://imgur.com/a/SJeF7#6): leather
* [Wedge/marshmallow](http://imgur.com/a/SJeF7#17): good insulation
* [Lugged/commando](http://imgur.com/a/SJeF7#9): best for harsh weather. Don't go overboard on lug size; a little goes a long way.
* [Dainite](http://imgur.com/b7X1M): a type of lugged sole often found on dress boots.

Lacing: almost all boots are [open-vamp](http://imgur.com/a/SJeF7#13) Derby-style

Height: the lowest boots are probably [Chukkas](http://imgur.com/a/SJeF7#16)

Toe box: [Plain-toe](http://imgur.com/a/SJeF7#14) or [cap-toe](http://imgur.com/a/SJeF7#0) boots are the most versatile. [Wingtip-toe](http://imgur.com/a/SJeF7#18) boots are somewhat dressy

**—Sizing**

Leather boots, and you should have some room to wiggle your toes, at least a little bit, at the front. They should not slip off your heel when you walk. Remember shoes are made on different [lasts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last); it can be that a given boot or manufacturer is not a good match for the shape of your foot.


**—Care**

For the vast majority of boots, eg. something from Obenaufs. Nice dress boots will take a polish just like dress shoes; refer to shoe care guides for that. Most boots can be worn every day; dress boots with lighter leather may benefit from a day of rest, and/or boot trees.

Most important rules: Don’t hang sweaters. Don’t machine wash or dry wool. Natural fibers beat synthetic. Don’t wear argyle. For fuck’s sake

***Jumper versus Cardigan*** - The term “sweater” refers to both jumpers and cardigans. Cardigans are basically sweaters that button or zip in the front, in fact some people think of Mr. Rogers as a style icon in his own right.



**I.	Materials.**

*A.	Wool.*

You’re probably aware that wool comes from animals—mostly sheep, alpaca, and muskoxen (qivuit), to name a few. Quality and softness vary with the animal, and with the animal’s age. Generally, cashmere is softer, lighter and warmer than alpaca, which is softer than most sheep’s wool.

Wool quality depends mostly on the strength and thickness of the fiber. Finer fibers are softer, is finer than most wool [(comparison to crossbreed pictured)](http://imgur.com/a/rQb28#14), which makes it suitable for blending with other fabrics like cashmere and silk. Fine wool is also less prone to pilling.

The main benefits of wool: Generally wool is more durable than materials like cotton and synthetics. It will last longer without developing holes or coming apart at the seams. Wool is generally a better insulator than cotton or synthetics

Downsides: Wool absorbs moisture more readily than other materials. Putting a wool sweater in the dryer will cause the moisture to be lost quickly

Caring for wool: Wash by hand in temperate water and dry on a drying rack, it will usually shrink one full dress size. If you’re worried that your sweater smells like BO, you should hang it up in the bathroom when you take a shower.

When a wool sweater starts to [pill](http://imgur.com/a/rQb28#13)

**Do not hang sweaters on clothes hangers.** You will end up with stretched shoulders. Fold them and keep them in a bureau. A wood bureau is best because it draws moisture away. Don’t stuff them in the drawer either—leave room for them to air out after you wear them.

*B.	Silk.*

Silk is a fiber produced by insects. It is more commonly used in finer clothes, but much less warm than wool.

Care: Mostly the same as wool. Silk will not shrink as much (about 8% of its original size

*C.	Other natural fibers: Cotton

Cotton is grown from a type of gossypium plant, but should still dry on a drying rack. They won’t shrink as much as wool—although they will shrink—but drying clothes in the dryer generally causes damage to the fibers and shortens their life. All three should be kept away from moisture, as they can develop mildew. But they are less susceptible to moths and carpet beetles, and they don’t usually pill like wool.

Cotton is common and inexpensive, so it is worn in all seasons.

Linen is higher on the quality totem than cotton. It’s expensive and tedious to manufacture, and probably not even then.) Hemp is a little heavier, and the fibers are stronger than cotton or linen. Its texture is comparable to that of linen.

*D.	Synthetics and blends.*

Synthetic materials are cheaper than natural ones. Acrylic sweaters are the most common. On the plus side, sunlight, bugs) and they tend to be machine washable. (Still dry on the rack, as acrylic will shrink and pill too.) The tradeoff is that they don’t keep their structure long, they’re usually made more cheaply, and they’re both less breathable and less warm.



**II.	Styles

Rule of thumb: Finer patterns for finer knits

**Solid Color**- With solid colors, lighter colors and pastels work well in spring and summer, navy blue works all year around.

Solid colored turtenecks frame the face well and give definition to the torso. Some people think they look [hipster](http://imgur.com/a/rQb28#11) or [effeminate](http://imgur.com/a/rQb28#10) (for better or worse), so expect to see them again next year or so.

A navy blue v-neck sweater with a white button down, and it keeps you warm. Crew necks are also acceptable, but in my opinion v-necks are easier to pair with a button down shirt. Darker reds are also acceptable, but since they remind me of Target employees, I pass them up over blue. 

**Stripes.** - In keeping with the rule from above: Thin stripes go better on fine knits. When it comes to stripes on thick-knit sweaters

**Fair Isle/Nordic Sweater.** - Fair isle sweaters took me by surprise this season. I long associated them with the ugly sweaters in the “avoid” category

Besides fit, creamy color. Too many colors will make it loud, and too few will make it dull. Some contrast is good, but there should be a happy medium.

Related is the Native American knit

**Aran, in case he was thrown overboard and drowned, and had to be identified. (According to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aran_sweater#Myths), this is likely a myth.)

Cable knits don’t have to fit perfectly around the midsection

**Avoid or Use Caution** - Argyle, Half-Zip, and Black Mannequins.

Avoid argyle sweaters. They are frequently associated with guys who are just starting to try dressing well without having read the rules. Argyle is angular and usually three colors, argyle socks are fine.)

[Coogis](http://imgur.com/a/rQb28#6) are only allowed if you’re trying to bring back [streetwear](http://imgur.com/a/rQb28#4) from the [early 1990s](http://imgur.com/a/rQb28#5). For all intents and purposes

If you’re going to wear an ugly or gimmicky sweater, but be warned, the novelty will wear off after the first time you wear it. After that, you will look like a try-hard jackass. On a similar note, reindeer sweaters should only be worn in the weeks leading up to the holidays, after which they should be retired until next year.

Half-zips are controversial

What you don't see is the spam queue, which I hope you all know are not allowed here. Somehow a thread comparing timberlands to uggs snuck under our radar. There's a ""DAE love these shoes?"" where the shoes are exactly what Jdbee wrote about barely a day ago. 

My point is, then of course that is appropriate, but please do a simple search before asking. I'll give you a tip - the spam filter treats self posts much better than link posts, especially if you are linking to stores.

I also wish for this to serve as a reminder. The items under **Important!** in the sidebar are actually important. Please read the rules, be descriptive in the title - ""Searching for an affordable slim polo"" is a much better title than ""Guys I have a question"". I thank you for your understanding.

My Best

Shortly after I started working at my current job, and he frequently wears gray or black undershirts under white/light blue dress shirts. This guy often appears before juries and is assigned the more “major” or “serious” criminal cases. While some of my complaints with his dress are knitpicky – not wearing a belt seems, and turning up in court in threadbare pants seem especially egregious.  

Yesterday

Sample dialogue:
“Hey _______ did you remember to put your pointers (her mocking term for collar stays) in today?

“I didn’t _______. I don’t know if you’ve noticed but I’m actually a man.”

Uproarious laughter followed.

From there the conversation just turned into making fun of “metros”. Another co-worker spent five minutes talking about how her husband owns only one tie that he proudly does not know how to tie.

My question to MFA is – What can be done about this? Should I just forget about it and go about my business? I think that

tl;dr – I’m openly mocked by a co-worker for dressing professionally

It's even easy enough to get the basics right (decent fit/style, is a pocket square a good idea and if so what kind? Let's consider the slightly more advanced topic of putting together a business outfit that's balanced

For this topic we'll consider four items mainly:

* **Suit/Jacket**

* **Shirt**

* **Tie**

* **Pocket Square**

Other accessories (cufflinks

When putting together these four items there are four main properties to assess:

* **Colour** - naturally a big one

* **Pattern** - Of great importance are patterns. The general advice given to people just starting is to minimise the amount of patterns you've got going on - a good

* **Material** - so easily overlooked - the texture and weight of the materials involved are crucial to a balanced outfit. If items are too similar it starts to look dull or faintly ridiculous. Too diverse and there's no theme or consistency.

*  **Formality/Style/Context** - a harder concept to describe. A lot of people think of suits as this generically ""formal"" style of clothing but it's far from the case. Different styles of suits and different combinations of items lend themselves to different situations and contexts easily. A dressy city suit is not the same as a more country style ensemble. A white dress shirt with French cuffs is out of place on a chequered brown tweed suit.

The guidance here is aimed at a business suit-and-tie wardrobe but the principles can easily be applied to a more blazer/odd-trouser ensemble. The latter section is especially useful there. A lot of this guide may seem prescriptive or rules based ""do this, however, is not at odds with the aim of finding your own personal style or expressing yourself through your clothing - instead the aim should be to marry your own self-expression with coherence and tastefulness. So very many people sacrifice cohesion and taste in the pursuit of self-expression and over-enthusiasm - while laudable - frequently leads to disaster.

One final note is that this is also not written in the pursuit of some faux-gentleman nonsense. Nothing here is about being ""timeless"" or ""classic"" or being ""dapper"". Many people on MFA may have little call to wear a suit let alone put together a wardrobe of suit/shirt/tie essentials. However plenty - myself included - do have a regular and practical need for it and the foundational advice only goes so far in these instances.

So here's a basic primer of non-designer streetwear brands (people always complain about jcrew's price so I'm not about to recommend $400 sneakers). We're talking patterned shirts

First off though

**A SELECTION OF BRANDS**

*This is just a primer. There are tons of streetwear brands

$$$ Supreme - Popularized by tyler the creator and odd future (although yes, [leather jacket](http://yolouis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/supreme-2011-springsummer-lookbook-2.jpg)

$$ Warriors of Radness - So Cal surf inspired clothing. Bright colors, [tanks and shorts](http://www.warriorsofradness.com/media/galleries/27/gallery_images/421/gallery_image/421_gallery_image_898775809.jpg)

$$ Naked &amp; Famous - Canadian designed mid level japanese denim. They do basic shirts as well. Examples: [selvedge denim](http://www.nakedandfamousdenim.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/Indigo-Selvedge-front-225x369.jpg)

$ Unbranded - Denim line made by naked &amp; famous

$ Obey - Shepard Fairey's clothing line. They pump out a pretty big collection each season, [chinos](http://shop.obeyclothing.com/images/PRODUCT/medium/OP1263S_111_KHAKI.jpg), [denim](http://shop.obeyclothing.com/images/PRODUCT/medium/OP1231_110_RAWINDIGO.jpg)

$ French Connection - They do a lot more than just tees with fuck mispelled on it. Some really interesting color blocked tees, [leather jacket](http://usamedia.frenchconnection.com/stormsites/fcus/images/products/large/55AS5.jpg), [color blocked and striped polo](http://usamedia.frenchconnection.com/stormsites/fcus/images/products/large/56CB5.jpg)

$ WESC - Swedish surf/skate influenced clothing. They sell entry level denim and are known for logo tees &amp; headphones but have good options for color blocked tees, [denim](http://wesc.com/img/public/item/31805/default,pdetail,default,b105127_341_f_1.jpg), [basic black jacket](http://wesc.com/img/public/item/28401/default,pdetail,b105436999f_33941.jpg),b102332001f_33935.jpg),b10450122bf_33813.jpg)

$ Cheap Monday - Very cheap denim. Examples: [denim](http://www.karmaloop.com/vendor/CHE/zoom/0100024-orgzoom3.jpg)

$ Alternative/American Apparel - These two brands are very interchangable and both do basic garments and tees. If the price seems steep look on forums for wholesalers who will dropship. 

$ RVCA - Another surf/skate brand. They do a lot of basics and a lot of logo tees. Examples: [sweater](http://www.karmaloop.com/vendor/RVC/zoom/10140073-blkzoom4.jpg)

**FOOTWEAR**

Alife - clean
Clae - don't buy at full price
Creative Recreation - I fucking hate them but they need to be mentioned  
Generic Man - laced shoes and loafers  
Generic Surplus - brand run by generic man
Gourmet - large array of sneakers  
Supra - ""moon boot""-ish high top sneakers and more out there low tops   
Nike - shout out for blazer high vintage   
Vans - if you don't know vans you should get off the internet   
Wesc - recently started doing shoes
  
**KEY ITEMS / BASIC WARDROBE**  

*TOPS*  
buttoned shirts (plaids, solids, etc)  
tees/tanks/polos (striped, logo/graphic are acceptable but would not be my first choice)  
sweatshirts - crewnecks, patterns, logo/graphic, colorblocked)  
sweaters (cardigans in solids
  
*OUTERWEAR*  
varsity jackets, military-ish jackets (keep colors and patterns simple, always go dark over light)

*BOTTOMS*  
dark denim

*SHOES*  
sneakers - your pants will dictate the shoes



**STYLING**  

Fit is hugely important but there is much more leeway for fit in streetwear than there is in traditional style. Many brands do hip-hop inspired relaxed fits and many brands do contemporary slim fits. A lot of brands do both. Make sure there is not a huge disparity between the fit of the top and bottom halfs - an oversized shirt can look good with really slim denim but only if you know exactly what you're doing

Pairing items is relatively easy depending on the look you're going for. Matching patterns and colors can make it tricky though. The easiest thing to do is only have one loud pattern per outfit. For example, wear a louder sweater or sweatshirt, but never be afraid to keep an entire outfit simple. Brand lookbooks are a very good place to look for pairing ideas as well, especially considering the overlap of products most brands have. 

Here is a very basic pairing template

SPRING / SUMMER:   
tee / tank + shorts + sneakers  
 
FALL / WINTER :  
  
tee + denim / pants + sneakers + (hoodie / sweater / jacket)  
crewneck / popover + denim / pants + sneakers + (jacket)  
buttoned shirt + denim / pants + sneakers + (hoodie / sweater / jacket)

You can skip ahead to ""Outerwear"" for the main guide

**Disclaimer/explanation:** Why did I write this?  Basically, but MFA has gotten people so hyped on Uniqlo, I think the demand is there, and maybe we can help guide people towards what they should actually be spending their money on, and why.  While this guide isn't an attempt to shill Uniqlo, it is to a certain extent written within a fashion vacuum, with little to no recommendations on what a better alternative to a certain garment might be within the same price range.  The whole idea with Uniqlo is that those alternatives will be few and far between

**This is a work in progress - any additions, and elaborations are encouraged.  I will edit and append as much as I can.  If anyone can help contribute links to Uniqlo fit pics, reviews, etc from MFA or elsewhere, that would be most helpful.**

----

A few things to start:

**1) Why buy Uniqlo:** Because they offer decent quality clothes at a fair price, and Style for basic menswear staples.  The majority of their designs keep things pretty simple, color selection is generally good, and the trends they do cash in on tend to be pretty safe ones.  Also the cut of their clothing is extremely accessible - on the slimmer side (proportionally), but not to any extreme lengths.  A very large majority will be able to find things that fit.

**2)** ***This cannot be stressed enough -***  **USE THE SIZE CHARTS!** Uniqlo's fairly comprehensive sizing charts and measurement guide are a blessing compared to some online retailers.  Learn your body measurements.  Measure garments that fit you well.  Make use of these numbers.  Knowing is half the battle

**3) Careful what link you use:**  The site has a very annoying habit of listing items multiple times just to pad out the visual layout.  For some reason these use different URL's that sometimes have differing available size and color combinations of the same items, links to the webstore tend to 404 quite a bit, but I've always had success when reloading the page or hitting back and reclicking the link.**

Edit: **4) Customer Feedback:**  From talking to employees, and even just a handful of requests or complaints on the same issue can prompt direct action.  Want a shipping option for Canada?  Want them to make MIJ denim in a wider range of cuts? [Let them know.](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/help/how-can-we-help)  Its not a futile gesture.

I'm going to list things as they are categorized on the store site for ease of reference and linking.  Also this version of the guide will naturally focus only on fall/winter items as that is whats available and relevant right now as far as the US online store is concerned.

----

**Outerwear**

[Blazers](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/mens-clothing/mens-outerwear/mens-blazers) - Great fit for the price - slim cut, in which case you are looking for the [Tasmanian Wool Jackets](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/store/made-for-all/men-tasmanian-wool-blended-slim-fit-jacket/070825-04-006).  They are priced between $100-150 depending on time of year, and are worth the extra cash over the other polyester-blend options if you are looking for suiting.

[Jackets](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/mens-clothing/mens-outerwear/mens-jackets) and [Coats](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/mens-clothing/mens-outerwear/mens-coats) -  Outerwear is one category where Uniqlo is pretty consistent.  Their fall/winter jackets are well designed and high quality for the price more or less across the board. If you like the design, and [their offering](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/store/made-for-all/men-wool-blended-pea-jacket/073087-09) this year is a fantastic option for the price (its even a good option compared to many that retail for closer to $200).  Also of note are the [Premium Down Ultra Light Jackets](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/store/made-for-all/men-premium-down-ultra-light-jacket/072570-69-004) and [Vests](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/store/made-for-all/men-premium-down-ultra-light-vest/072571-32-004).  While not warm enough to be a stand-alone winter jacket in colder climates, these are great layering pieces.  They are extremely thin, light, and compressible, and surprisingly warm for how light they are.  They can be layered under almost anything, and while some may not like the semi-glossy appearance

----

**Tops**

[Dress Shirts](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/mens-clothing/mens-tops/mens-dress-shirts) - Lots of options here, with everything else falling somewhere in between.  Just pay attention to the sizing, as there are a few different cuts mixed in here.

[Casual Shirts](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/mens-clothing/mens-tops/mens-casual-shirts) - The oft mentioned Uniqlo Oxford Cloth Button Down is currently available in two slightly different cuts, but the difference between the two cuts is fairly slight.  The Flannel and Broadcloth shirts are pretty self-explanatory, decent quality for the price.  The quality of the flannel material isn't on the same level as something you'd pay $50+ for, but still a solid cheap option.

[Fleece](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/mens-clothing/mens-tops/mens-fleece) - Its cheap 100% polyester fleece.  Looks and feels cheap.  Not really recommended.

[Sweatshirts](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/mens-clothing/mens-tops/mens-sweatshirts) - Solid options for hoodies and crew necks.  Cotton count is a little low

[T-shirts](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/mens-clothing/mens-tops/mens-t-shirts) - The ""Soft Touch"" shirts ride a nice line between heavy T-shirt and light-weight cotton sweater.  The Dry Packaged T-shirts are the standard Uniqlo T-shirt - nicely cut

[Sweaters + Knits](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/mens-clothing/mens-tops/mens-sweaters-and-knits) - Hit or miss quality wise

* Cashmere - Not stand-out quality cashmere

* Merino - Decent.  They are soft and warm

* Lambswool - 100% lambswool sweater for $20, they shed, and they are super thinly woven, to the point that the color of your shirt may show through the sweater depending on color combo and sweater tightness.  But they are warm as hell and nicely cut, and might be a decent fast fashion buy to add some color to a winter wardrobe.  Not really recommended though.

* Heavy-gauge - Hey look, people.  Otherwise, lots of polyester here, but they still manage to look and feel halfway decent despite it.  Same goes for the fair isle stuff.

[Polos](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/mens-clothing/mens-tops/mens-polo-shirts) - The best polos in the price range

So it's been awhile since I added anything of substance, as I was trying to apply for jobs, I wore said shirt to a couple interviews. Each time I put the shirt on, I couldn't help but give a little ""wow"" to how well it fit, how good it looked, and how comfortable it was.

Thinking on that, if it doesn't fit, we'll fix it if you send it back). Compare those prices to most retailers--more expensive, sure, but not by much. Brooks Brothers' shirts sit between $30-$80, depending on if they are on sale. Express is $30-$60.

Almost always, buttons, pockets, cuffs, placket, fabric type, etc. I would almost think at this point, you'd be foolish to not get it MTM. The only exceptions that I can think of would be if you're on an extremely tight budget--even then

1372116731.0,1h038j,Are you a Big-Thigh-Guy? Here is another selvedge option for you.,RyanThePhotog,545,161,235,"So I found MFA about 6 months ago and seriously started caring about my wardrobe about 4 months ago. Since then I have been on a quest to find the perfect jean to fit my (relatively so) gigantic thighs and ass that I woke up and found after never skipping leg day. My first pair were [some Levi 501 STF](http://i.imgur.com/PHbbnl7.jpg). It was my first venture away from my previous Buckle boot cut jeans. 

The consensus was

I was fairly happy but I was still on the search for some selvedge to give it a try... but everything made in the raw/selvedge/japanese denim market is really biased toward skinny dudes.. which I always considered myself skinny until I started buying clothes to fit me right.

After hearing plenty of good things about Unbranded I decided to get my measurements and give it a try. I wanted something with a taper so I picked out the [UB201 Tapered cut](http://theunbrandedbrand.com/collections/all/products/ub201-tapered-fit-indigo-selvedge). Boy were my measurements off. I measure in at about a 23"" thigh. and a 33"" waist. Based on those measurements I opted for the size 33 (which says it runs a 34 in the waist) I waited a week for those jeans and I was giddy the day they arrived. 

Trying to put those things on was like trying to fit into my jeans from 5th grade. Ain't gonna happen. My thighs were simply too big. I couldn't even pull the things up to my waist.. let alone button them.

So I went back to the site and picked out the size 36. I figured 34 was nowhere near enough of a size up.. and 35 doesn't exist I guess. 

I will let the pictures speak for themselves here but I am much happier with these.

[Side (Mmmmm big sexy donk)](http://i.imgur.com/0fMBof3.jpg)

[Normal](http://i.imgur.com/d0kYPTy.jpg)

Admittedly

Here are some of my measurements to base off of:

Waist: 33.5
Upper thigh: 23
Inseam: 33

I think my only fit complain is the rise is REALLY low compared to what I am used to and it feel like when I bend over everyone is checking out my ass. Dumb stupid big sexy ass.

1347483465.0,zsaj4,Leather Jackets: A Lengthy Buying Guide (v1.0),djmykeski,454,76,155,"**Preface**

No single item of clothing screams ""Badass"" like a leather jacket. For decades, they are a statement or a lifestyle piece. An entire outfit can be built around a single statement piece like a leather jacket, even whole wardrobes. Women will love you. Men will want to be you. (Don't believe me? Read this [review NSFW-language](http://goo.gl/UfyQa).

For that reason, but I would generally avoid those because they use cheaper leather which will not last as long and they usually do not have a fitted cut. If you really need to pick something up for the 250-500 range, it's a much better idea to look for used or vintage items on ebay or buy/sell forums. This is definitely one of those places where the rule should be ""Don't buy something similar to the thing you want. Buy the thing you want."" 


Also, do NOT rush into a leather jacket thinking that just because you put one on it will give you insta-swag. You must already have everything else pretty much on point to have the prerequisite amount of swag to pull these off.

**Styles**
Every leather company always makes jackets in a few different styles. If you find that you like the quality of one company but want a specific cut, Double Rider, and Moto. More details are below, but as you get to know each style, you'll find a lot of the other weird cuts are just variations of these 3 styles.

* **Bomber** (aka Flight Jacket
* **Double Rider** (aka [Perfecto](http://iwouldcoco.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/schott-perfecto-jacket-with-no-one-inside.jpg)) - The original first leather motorcycle jacket developed by Schott NYC and introduced in 1928. This is the jacket that was worn by [Marlon Brando in The Wild Ones](http://thezipper.umwblogs.org/files/2009/04/marlon-brando-the-wild-one.jpg), and greasers, and [all around badasses](http://filmpopper.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Terminator.jpg) since their introduction. This jacket has become synonymous with rebellion and is not to be taken lightly. It was made for motorcycle riders so it was meant to be functional. This jacket has a very distinct look because of it's asymmetrical front zipper and large snap lapels. Usually meant to be worn casually, but can be added over a button up and tie for an [edgier look](http://cdn.hypebeast.com/image/2011/04/bedwin-leather-jacket-3.jpg). So the next question you should ask yourself is.....[Are you man enough to rock the DR?](http://cdn.dressed.so/i/4f4ce2623c367m.jpg)
* **Moto (aka Cafe Racer)** - The deconstructed minimalist motorcycle jacket. It is a smaller simpler version of a Double Rider Motocycle jacket that is a little slimmer and will not include the extra flaps, this jacket does not have an asymmetrical zipper and will usually have a [small snap collar](http://i50.tinypic.com/2vt73nb.jpg) instead of the large fold-over ones. Some ""collared moto"" styles will add a [small collar] (http://i.imgur.com/QHSC3l.jpg) while still keeping the minimalist design. Because of the minimalist design this jacket has a less ""edgy"" look and is a lot more versatile. This jacket can be a [great addition](http://cdn.styleforum.net/c/c4/c460af5c_IMG_0022crop.jpeg) to any [street casual style](http://goo.gl/ESvcT) or even equally great with a [business casual look](http://goo.gl/nDNtp).
* **Peacoat** Just like they sound. A peacoat style jacket [but in leather](http://i.imgur.com/sNEmcIO.jpg). I would stay away from these because the traditional peacoat is a wool jacket (sometimes with leather trim) and these leather versions are not as versatile as the wool. They were popular a few years back and are generally aimed at a little dressier look and would not work as well with a completely casual outfit. Still acceptable if you have your heart set on one but a nice wool peacoat may serve you better in the long run.
* **Fencing Jacket** An aggressively cut jacket designed similarly after fencing jackets. Usually only reserved goth ninja styles and will definitely not be as versatile as the jackets above.
* **Varsity and Baseball** These are casual jackets that can have either leather only sleeves or be all leather. Because the all leather versions are generally made in suede these are a lot less expensive than many of the jackets above and can be a great addition to a casual wardrobe for a [street inspired style](http://goo.gl/p7vYg).
* **Trench Coat** Just like it sounds. A trench coat made of leather that will be long and used as an overcoat. CAUTION: Unless you really know what you're doing and are going for a [Goth Ninja look](http://img163.imageshack.us/img163/7914/dsc0218k.jpg)

**Leather Quality**
-Because leather is one of the strongest and most durable materials you can use for apparel, just like in nice shoes. Durability and quality is the #1 reason why you do not skimp on your leather purchase. When looking at leather jackets one of your major considerations is what type of leather it is made of and the thickness of the leather. Unfortunately, this is one of those scenarios that the better stuff is usually way more expensive. The list below can serve as an intro to the most popular leather types, but is by no means an exhaustive list: 

* **Cowhide, but may not be as supple to the touch. [Cow Example](http://www.uswings.com/images/cowhide_swatch.jpg) [Horse](http://www.uswings.com/images/horsehide_swatch.jpg)

* **Calf skin** similar to cowhide but slightly softer. Meant to be broken in and is still considered heavy.

* **Lamb** Very light and soft type of leather. The feeling of this will almost feel like cloth or silk like. Many people may not even believe it's leather because of it's soft hand feel. [Example](http://www.uswings.com/images/lambskin_swatch.jpg)

* **Goat** Softer than calf

* **Buffalo and Bison** more heavy leather types. Used for protection and functionality. Will last eons.


**Brands**

**Low End Cheap Leathers** *Generally recommended to avoid these unless you're really on a budget*

* Caine [Website](http://goo.gl/vRLcW)
* Aero Leather [Website](http://goo.gl/Kw6yZ)
* Wilsons Leather [Website](http://goo.gl/I6iww)


**Mid Range ($500 - $1000)** *This is a great place for most people to start with their leather purchases*

* SchottNYC [Website](http://www.schottnyc.com/) [1](http://goo.gl/E1STc) *These guys are the real deal. The original motorcycle jacket company and still relevant today*
* Vanson [Website](http://goo.gl/HVUiV) [1](http://cdn.hypebeast.com/image/2009/08/victim-vanson-leathers-riders-jacket-1.jpg) 
* Temple of Jawnz [""Unofficial"" Official Website](http://templeofjawnz.com/) [1](http://goo.gl/3SZLi), it should be a ToJ.*

Here's what I'd look for, prices, and recrafting aren't necessarily correct for Aldens, vintage Florsheims, etc.)*

 * **Model.**  AE makes a lot of stinkers, kiltie tassels ,moc-toes, and bicycle stitching, to name a few.  It's probably easier to say what to look *for* - classic models, even if they have different names the the current line-up.  Strands, Park Avenues, MacNeils, Kenwoods, wingtips

 * **Sizing.**  AE sells shoes in [quite a few different lasts (the overall shape of the shoe)](http://www.allenedmonds.com/aeonline/AllAboutLastsView?catalogId=40000000001&amp;langId=-1&amp;storeId=1) in addition to the traditional sizes and widths (from narrow AAA through extra-wide EEE).  If you don't know your size, then a pair of 12AA Strands will strangle your feet and a 12E pair will have them rattling around.  If you measure above or below average in width or length, there's good and bad news.  The good news is that auctions for your size will be less competitive and the final bids will be lower.  The bad news is that your size will show up far less often than average lengths and widths.  Those of you with 10D feet can invert the good and bad news.

 * **Condition of the uppers**.  You want shoes that were conditioned regularly and stored with trees.  Look for minimal creasing and absolutely zero cracks or tears in the leather.  Also keep an eye out for stains

 * **Condition of the insole and lining**.  Again, while [this pair is on the verge of being too worn out to consider buying (depending on the condition of the uppers and soles).](http://i.imgur.com/bgVggAm.jpg)  When there are so many available, there's no reason not to hold out for a lightly-worn pair. Like many better shoes, AEs are constructed with a cork footbed that slowly takes on the shape of your foot.  A well-worn shoe's footbed will be so compressed by the previous owner that they may never feel comfortable.  However, [AE's $125 recrafting/resoling process includes a new set of cork footbeds](http://www.allenedmonds.com/aeonline/RecraftingView?storeId=1&amp;langId=-1&amp;catalogId=40000000001), so that may or may not be a deal-breaker for you.

 * **Condition of the soles and heels**.  Don't worry about the forefoot being scratched slightly. [ As a recent thread on MFA demonstrated](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1j9f7r/is_this_normal_for_first_day_wear_with_leather/), that would have to be shell cordovan for under $100.  [Here are some soles that are ready for a replacement](http://imgur.com/a/5B6Na).  The hole in the top layer of leather and the welt stitching being ground down so far it's invisible are both signs that you should either pass on the auction or mentally include the cost of recrafting/resoling.  [These, on the other hand, still have a ton of life left in them.](http://imgur.com/a/EhUoW)   To reiterate, don't let superficial scratching scare you away, but be wary of soles that are worn through.

 * **Secret shell**.  Go back to [this pair of longwings I posted earlier.](http://i.imgur.com/LLN7amu.jpg)  They're made from shell cordovan, but once in a while, they don't and you can pick up a pair for an absolute steal.  You've got to know what to look for for though.  The biggest tell-tale signs are (1) the color, which is often a purply-red on older shoes (but not always, especially on newer shoes), (2) a distinct puckering around the eyelets which occurs because shell is much thicker than calf leather, and (3) creasing on the forefoot that looks more like large gentle waves than small wrinkles. [Here's a beautiful pair that shows all three characteristics.](http://i.imgur.com/Rb0C7Yl.jpg) If the model number inside the shoe is still visible in the auction listing, and it's the best resource for learning to spot secret shell.](http://www.askandyaboutclothes.com/forum/showthread.php?100929-Everybody-s-favorite-game-Shell-or-Not-Shell-\(Warning-Big-Pics\)/page59) [Shell is gorgeous

 * **Price, you should be willing to pay $75-100 for a used pair.  You can get factory seconds (with minor blemishes or stitching errors) for around $150 regularly ([sometimes even $125](http://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/1jdwdf/allen_edmonds_seconds_sale/)), so don't overpay for used shoes.  Watch out for ridiculous shipping costs too, especially if the price seems too good to be true.  Shipping a pair of shoes with insurance and delivery confirmation should never be more than $15-20 (unless it's crossing an international border).  

 * **Using Ebay Effectively**.  [PTO's general ebay guide](http://putthison.com/post/318472789/clothesshoppingonebay) is absolutely worth reading, you may be one of the lucky few who stumbled across it.   Note that you can use boolean operators in your saved searches, which will help you find listings by both model name (""MacNeil"") and description (""wingtips"").  (2) Using a sniping service like [Gixen](http://www.gixen.com/index.php) will let you bid at the absolute last second and avoid some of the bidding wars that artificially drive up the final price.  (3) [Search completed auctions](http://pages.ebay.com/tr/en-us/completedlistings/) to get a sense of what your model and size have been selling for recently.  [This search for Park Aves in my size](http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_sacat=0&amp;_from=R40&amp;_nkw=allen+edmonds+park+ave+12d&amp;LH_Complete=1&amp;rt=nc) tells me that if I want a pair in a reddish-brown like merlot/cognac/burgundy, I can be patient and expect to win an auction for around $65-75.

★★**Important note:  It may take some time to find shoes in the size

If you don't need shoes in a hurry, ""Great-Uncles don’t die on your schedule, and once-in-a-lifetime job interviews don’t happen right when you expect them. So be prepared.""

With that being said

**Material**

The material of a button up is important when deciding on which shirt you want to wear. A flannel button up is not going to be fun to wear in the middle of a Georgia summer, but these are the main ones.

* 
[Seersucker](http://i.imgur.com/NvW65.jpg) - Seersucker shirts are a summer staple, seersucker shirts are not a traditional dress shirt. You generally don’t wear a tie with a seersucker shirt.

* 
[Linen](http://i.imgur.com/goYFW.jpg) - This is one of the most lightweight fabrics that button ups are made out of. It is very breathable, it is often times a little bit see through. If this is a problem, you can always wear an undershirt (v-neck of course, don’t want a collar showing). Linen is normally relegated to warm weather wear, but during the summer months people wear it both formally and casually. Ties can work with linen shirts, but it is somewhat rare. 

* 
[Flannel](http://i.imgur.com/hVnsZ.jpg) – This is one of the heavier fabrics you can get a shirt made out of. Usually fairly soft, wear a tie with a flannel shirt.

* 
[Oxford Cloth](http://i.imgur.com/rGDZX.jpg) - This is probably the most versatile fabric that men’s shirts are made out of. Oxford cloth is normally a heavy fabric, but IMO it is acceptable with a sport coat or blazer. If you plan on wearing a suit, you should go for a shirt that is more formal.

* 
[Pinpoint](http://i.imgur.com/zxMHa.jpg) – Pinpoint is somewhat of a combination between Oxford cloth and Broadcloth. It utilizes the same weave as oxford cloth, but lighter than oxford; they will also appear ‘crisper’ than an oxford cloth. Ties are perfectly acceptable with pinpoint shirts.

* 
[Broadcloth/Poplin]( http://i.imgur.com/v4Ibj.jpg) – There are slight differences between Broadcloth and Poplin, broadcloth is a more formal fabric and is rarely considered casual. Ties are fine with broadcloth.

* 
[Twill](http://i.imgur.com/FmlLP.jpg) – Twills have a diagonal weave to them and are because of this are often less likely to wrinkle. They are also fairly soft fabric. The weight can vary and it’s a fabric that can work both casually and formally. Ties work with twills.

There are other fabrics that shirts are made out of (Madras

[edit]kjetha posted a great comparison image [here](http://i.imgur.com/aLUOm.jpg)

**Colors and Matching**

A general rule for shirt colors is that the lighter the color, light blue, light pink, and most pastels are usually business appropriate. Dark blues, reds, maroon, neons

Another general rule to follow is to keep your shirt lighter (or a similar shade) than your pants. Ie: black dress pants and a white shirt or khaki chinos and a pastel blue shirt look good most of the time

Finally, but a white or pink shirt will).

[**Old Navy/GAP/Banana Republic**](http://oldnavy.gapcanada.ca)

Low to moderate prices. Both online and physical stores. 

They are technically different stores, but not too much more, imo. Their fits can be a bit large and boxy. Gap and BR are good, but their regular prices are a bit high for the quality, if you can get good sales they're worth it. Shipping is great with them in Canada, free with orders over $50 and free returns. I've dealt with them before and it's gone well.

[**Club Monaco**](http://www.clubmonaco.ca/) 

Mid range pricing. Online and physical. Free shipping over $150

Great sales

[**Rooney**](http://www.rooneyshop.com/) 

Based in Montreal. They carry mid-high brands. Free shipping on all orders.

[**Tate and Yoko**](http://tateandyoko.com/) 

Also based in Montreal. Carry mostly premium denim lines. $5 shipping. No refunds though

[**J Crew**](http://www.jcrew.com/index.jsp)

Mid range pricing. Physical and online. Ships to Canada for 9.95 flat rate

[**Zara**](http://www.zara.com/ca/) 

Fast-fashion

[**H&amp;M**](http://www.hm.com/ca/) 

No online shopping, and the fit is usually good but the quality can be hit and miss. I like them for the most part, and they're good for experimenting with new looks before you go and drop big coin on a nice piece.

[**SSense**](http://www.ssense.com) 

High fashion, I'd guess.

[**JM**](http://www.jm.ca/) 

Made in Canada underwear. They sent me an item with the security tags with them still attached and sent me a replacement for free

[**Four Horsemen**](http://www.fourhorsemen.ca/) 

Mid-high pricing, only exchanges or store credit.

[**Frank and Oak**](http://www.frankandoak.com/)

A different route. Invite only, so no big risk. I've heard mainly good from them.

[**The Bay**](http://www.thebay.com/)

Canadian Macy's, Levi's, Kenneth Cole, etc. Prices a bit high, but frequent sales. I quite like their Hudson Room brand.

[**LL Bean**](http://www.llbean.com/) 

Talked about often on MFA

[**Joe Fresh**](http://www.joefresh.com/en/) 

Inexpensive basics. Available in Superstores and some independent JF stores (Vancouver has one I know). Good fit, better than H&amp;M imo.

[**RW&amp;Co**](http://www.rw-co.com/) 

Online and in-store. Classic

[**Nomad**](http://www.nomadshop.net/) 

Based in Toronto. Mainly nicer designer things (APC, but if you can afford stuff here, an extra $15 probably won't break the bank.

[**Haven**](http://havenshop.ca/) 

Similar to Nomad

[**Revolve Clothing**](http://www.revolveclothing.com/)

A lot of designer things, Naked and Famous, 3Sixteen. Rather pricey, but they seem to have a lot of sale items at any given time. Free shipping to Canada.

1329263531.0,ppvnb,PSA: Guide to washing clothes and dry cleaning,flutitis,442,79,173,"This is a topic that comes up quite a bit on MFA

**The basics**

* Batch similar colours to cut down on loads.  T-shirts and shirts can be washed together. Have a mix of underwear colours so no matter what you're washing you always have underwear.
* A front-loader washing machine is far gentler on your clothes than a top-loader.  Hand washing is best
* Use less detergent than recommended - past a point more detergent doesn't mean cleaner
* Just because it doesn't smell
* The only items that should ever go in the dryer are underwear
* Tumble dryers are brutal on clothes - even on delicate settings they are too hot for most items
* Never dry clothes in the sun (except for whites) - it will bleach the colours very quickly.
* Dry cleaning is very harsh on your clothes


**Socks and underwear**

* Socks and underwear should be washed after every wear
* Washed on warm cycles (30 C
* Can be dried using a dryer - these are the only items you should ever consider using a dryer - everything else should be hung to dry.



**T-shirts

* T-shirts, no exception.
* Sweatshirts can be washed infrequently
* They will usually be ok with warm water (polo shirts may need a cold cycle)
* Gently pull them into shape before hang drying or flat drying for sweatshirts.


**Dress/business/button-down shirts**

* Should be washed after every wear.  If you wear undershirts they can be worn 2 to 4 times before washing
* A good quality shirt
* Washed  on the most gentle cycle in cold water.  Hand washing is better
* Shirts should only ever be dried on a wood hanger to keep the shape - Ikea hangers are great for this. Never user a wire hanger - you will ruin the shape of your shirts.
* Under no circumstances have them dry cleaned
* If your business shirts start to get stained around the collar
* If your underarms get a build-up that smells when you wear them
* NEVER re-iron dress/business shirts after wearing them once - you're cooking the sweat


**Jumpers/sweaters/cardigans/knits**

* Anything wool should generally be dry-cleaned
* Then, with a slow spin.  Or even better hand wash (but never wring them out)
* Use a gentle detergent designed for wool.
* Knits should be gently pulled into shape, horizontally), either on a fold out drying rack even better on a pop-up mesh rack.  [These can be bought very cheaply](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_0_10?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=mesh+drying+rack&amp;x=0&amp;y=0&amp;sprefix=mesh+dryin%2Caps%2C362).
* Never ever ever put these in a dryer.


**Anything silk**

* Extra gentle hand wash in cold water
* Hang dry only
* Dry cleaning is generally out of the question


**Jeans/chinos**

* Jeans/cotton chinos should be washed every 4 to 8 or so wears (you be the judge) or if the knees are starting to stretch out.  Cold wash only.
* Exception - raw denim should not be washed
* Hang dry only.


**Linen suits/trousers**

* Linen trousers can be hand washed
* Spot treatments on light coloured linen will show
* Linen suits should be dry cleaned only very infrequently (eg once a year).  Even thought you might be washing the trousers
* Especially with light weight linens


**Suits**

* Suits should be dry cleaned only and very occasionally - usually once a year is enough
* Steamed gently in between for shape/wrinkles and the pants pressed for creases.  Hanging in a steamy bathroom is a good method if you don't have a steamer.
* You shouldn't wear a suit two days in a row - after you wear it it should be hung on a good quality hanger (to keep the shape)
* If you press the pants yourself
* If any suit claims it is machine washable

So I put together a $500 Expansion Kit that assumes you have [the basics](http://redd.it/mu2zu) covered, but still focused on versatility and value. 

This particular kit focuses on rugged outdoor spring/summer style - camping, this is the closest to my own style.  

It's eight items, non-boring wardrobe.

[Here's the graphic overview

 * [New Balance H710 mid-top hiking shoes](http://tinyurl.com/7qu42hs), but you can also find them in [navy nubuck](http://newbalance-online.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=216), [tan/navy](http://tinyurl.com/76wewj4), and [light tan](http://tinyurl.com/6nr9z3s).

 * [Bean blucher mocs](http://www.llbean.com/llb/shop/65129?feat=505906-GN3), and more versatile than boat shoes, imo.  GQ's Creative Director: ""L.L.Bean created its now classic Blucher Moc in 1936. The idea was to give Maine dwellers a casual shoe that would help their feet withstand the state’s damp and often unpredictable climate. Today its untrendy status is what makes it so desirable. Of-the-moment menswear designers like Tim Hamilton and Michael Bastian love to wear them, as do their models. And why wouldn’t they? They’re virtually indestructible and can be worn every day of the year, with bare feet or the thickest of wool socks.""

The short inseam is purely functional - if you're using these for their intended purpose (hiking, climbing, etc), you want the range of movement that a short inseam offers.  

 * [Snap-front down vest](http://www.landsend.com/pp/mens-down-vest~234304_-1.html?bcc=y&amp;action=order_more&amp;sku_0=::TVY&amp;CM_MERCH=IDX_overstocks-_-men-_-outerwear&amp;origin=index)

 * [Lightweight pullover anorak](http://www.llbean.com/llb/shop/73093?feat=anorak-SR0), I really like the Penfield [Holbrook](http://www.penfieldusa.com/us/holbrook-green.html) (pullover) and [Gibson](http://www.penfieldusa.com/us/gibson-heritage-blue.html) (zip-up) as alternatives.

 * [Heather grey sweatshirt](http://store.archivalclothing.com/products/columbiaknit-sweatshirt), but I can vouch for the fit and materials of Archival's.  [Left Field NYC has a bunch too.](http://www.leftfieldnyc.net/category/sweats)

**Total = $496**

I want to reiterate that this kit assumes you have the spring/summer basics covered. If you don't already have lightweight chinos in neutral colors, boat shoes, plimsolls, etc, etc, etc, then those are a priority over all this nonsense.

**That said

1.    Branching out from the basics is about building your own aesthetic, please do. I'd love to see other iterations of this idea, and they'd be good for the community.

***What is an inspiration album for?***

This should be obvious, and this is very important:

**The point is not to dress or look exactly like the models in the photos.**

The fact that some people think this boggles my mind. Firstly, which it usually isn't). You don't have to have look anything like the model or even like the outfit he's wearing to at least try to appreciate one or two aspects of the outfit that you may not have thought of on your own.

If any particular look doesn't appeal to you, that's fine too. But don't be so closed-minded as to think that no one else could possibly get something out of it.

***But I'm not skinny/European/effeminate/whatever!***

OK, whether it's the color combination, fabrics, layering, shoes, or a million other things. Are you too built to wear shoes? No, you're not. Get over yourself

***Do people really dress like this? I just wear jeans and t-shirts and get tons of pussy lol. Faggots.***

1347192723.0,zlkto,Annoucement: New policy on interactions between companies and the MFA subreddit,ZanshinJ,428,82,41,"Hey everyone

Since Kalium and I started this place over three years ago, we've had the CEO of Allen Edmonds as well as a writer for Esquire talk with us in a professional capacity, and we'd like to continue this trend.

We're hoping to implement a general policy that outlines acceptable conduct for these cases that we can use for future reference. It'll speed up the setup time and allow some unique contributions to the subreddit. In doing so, nor are we allowing the posting of sales or anything else considered unacceptable for the subreddit or spam. What we're instead hoping for is community members that provide content and contribute to the subreddit within a professional capacity.

That said

* Individuals acting on behalf of a company will receive special flair identifying them as such.
* Said individuals must comply with all posting guidelines as expected of anyone else.
* Said individuals may make one initial posting acting as a combined introduction/AMA
* In order to receive this flair/permission

For example, he could message the moderators about contributing to the subreddit on behalf of Denimvest Clothing. We say ""okay, but follow the rules,"" and give them user flair stating ""CEO, Denimvest Clothing"". The fellow posts an AMA once and then acts like any other MFA member.

We're hoping this will act similarly to the panelist system of /r/AskScience and the moderator-approved IAMA posts. Ideally this will provide a broader spectrum of fashion advice and style information to our community.

1369885260.0,1fbd8u,Skin Tone and Color Coordination Guide Part 1,Deejayce,410,69,89,"***Part 1

.

Before I start, I use google for most of my searches and many of the pictures are not of men. That doesn’t really matter too much in the long run, because I’m talking about the skin (mostly), not the features of said person (mostly). When I go over the fashion part, I will try to find male pictures to get the point across.

.

This should be seen as an accessory to fashion and less of a basic guideline because what I’m trying to explain is the difference between a good outfit and a great one.

.

.

**Section 1: What is a Skin Tone and How Do I Find Mine?**

.

For starters

.

* Complexion (at least in this guide) is your “whiteness or brownness.” I will describe this in terms of light or dark color of skin.
* Skin Tone (for this guide) will be referring to the undertones present in a person’s skin. Generally, warm, cool and neutral.

.


There are ways to determine skin tone easily. Of these

* **Vein Test**. Flip over your arm and examine your veins. Are they bluish, warm and if they are in-between, you’re neutral. This should be with natural light.

* The **Sliver/Gold Test** is also simple. Hold up some silver next to your face and some gold. If the gold looks nicer, you’re cool and if both, you’re neutral. 

* **Reflection Test** Scrub your face pretty well (don’t rub it raw) and hold a towel that is white around your face and look in a mirror, if it looks blue, you’re cool, if you can’t tell it’s most likely neutral.

.

**Section 2: Cool Skin Tones**

.

Looks like you are sporting [blue]( http://imgur.com/GNYL0dz), [this]( http://imgur.com/uGgZz61), [this]( http://imgur.com/mi7FbTg) or [this]( http://imgur.com/kfzwj7F).

.

These people generally look best in [silver]( http://imgur.com/UBTg8Eu), try going [darker]( http://imgur.com/DrT5T1K) than your eye color. My theory on why the bold colors work nicer is that it [breaks up]( http://imgur.com/b5FtMZs) the [monotony]( http://imgur.com/x7zyMUO) (referencing man second from left who does make up partially with the bright white collared shirt) of the look and really makes more of a statement. 

.

Do not wear [beige]( http://imgur.com/3FOwZZQ) and [a]( http://imgur.com/1NwMkPg) v [o]( http://imgur.com/WEH5PHQ) i [d]( http://imgur.com/Eux1elF) orange. There is always some lee-way with all rules. 

.

If this goes over well, universal colors and color matching.

But you know what?  They're just leather shoes, all bound up with frat guys, preppy guys, douchebags, 80s movie villains, I don't know.

* This is super important: **Make sure you get your upper body/lower body porportions right.** If you long torsoed, everything is proportion.

* Related to the last point, then it's just right for you. Blazers in Small/Medium/Large sizes from a place like H&amp;M or Zara aren't going to look right; instead, go to a store that sells formalwear, get one in a a ""short"" size and get it slimmed. 

* **Wear tapered jeans/pants.** Always. You want to avoid like you're standing on two rectangles. 

* **Don't tuck your jeans into your sneakers/boots, do a single, small cuff rather than a chunky triple-cuff or something.

* **Make sure your shirts and pants fit slim**  ""Relaxed"" or ""slouchy"" items (espeically knitwear) aren't flattering to shorter guys.

* **Don't bother wearing button downs untucked unless they're tailored** (or from a brand like Band of Outsiders). Buy a nice belt and tuck them in instead. In general

* **Shorter guys should stick with vertical lines or no pattern when it comes to their clothes** - it will help you look taller. Checked patterns will disrupt the flow of an onlookers gaze to the left and right

* Gain a bit of muscle

---

**Cleansers**

Cleansers are your basic face wash. Its job is to remove excess oil and dirt from your pores. Some people just use water if their skin is able to naturally achieve that perfect pH balance. The ones specifically for acne will contain 1-2% salicylic acid

A lot of guys don't wash their face effectively. It's pretty simple. Wet your face with warm water to help loosen up dead skin then lather and scrub your face gently with the cleanser. Rinse with warm water to flush the crap out of your pores then rinse again with *cold water to minimize the appearance of your pores (important)*. 

Picking a cleanser is a personal preference since everyone's skin is different. I'm using this one right now: 

* [Philosophy Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser](http://www.amazon.com/Philosophy-Purity-Simple-One-Step-Cleanser/dp/B00021C1NG/)

**Toner**

Every time you wash your face you should be applying toner afterwards. Glycerol is the active ingredient in toner. It basically minimizes the appearance of pores and brings the natural moisture of your skin to the surface. Just wet a cotton square with it and rub it over your face. It's also a mild cleanser so you will notice all the shit that your cleanser missed after using this.

* [Neutrogena Pore Refining Toner](http://www.amazon.com/Neutrogena-Refining-Toner-Hydroxy-Formula/dp/B0000535RA/)

**Daytime Moisturizer**

This one is pretty important as it acts as a protective barrier against the outside world. Skin cancer runs in my family so sunscreen makes me feel better. I use one with a slight tint to even out my skin tone and cover up any red spots. It's like wearing make-up but without the social stigma.

* [Olay Definity Color Recapture](http://www.amazon.com/Olay-Definity-Color-Recapture-Light/dp/B0019Z8HT6/)

**Night-time Moisturizer**

Moisturizing at night is optional

* [Neutrogena Ageless Restoratives Anti-Oxidant Cream](http://www.amazon.com/Neutrogena-Ageless-Restoratives-Anti-Oxidant-Moisture/dp/B000R2YFZW/)

**Eye Roller**

Another nice to have. Your eyes are the most expressive part of your face. If you have puffy or dark circles under your eyes, or stay up too late.

* [Garnier Skin Renew Anti-Dark Circle Eye Roller](http://www.amazon.com/Garnier-Anti-Dark-Circle-Roller-0-50-Fluid/dp/B003RF82RI/)

**Deep Cleaning Pores**

If you want to get super OCD

* Tools like this [loop whitehead extractor](http://www.amazon.com/Suvorna-Whitehead-Remover-Comedone-Extractor/dp/B0019TM2E8/) will help you manually extract shit from your skin. Simply apply pressure and drag it over a pore and it will squeeze the junk out. This causes less redness than popping a zit with your fingers since there is less contamination.
* [Pore Strips](http://www.amazon.com/Biore-Pore-Perfect-Cleansing-Strips/dp/B0009EILKS) are also really effective. I use them maybe 1-2 times a month. I take pretty good care of my face and [a lot of shit](http://i.imgur.com/GXm7Z.jpg) still comes out of it.
* [Masks](http://www.amazon.com/Aztec-Secret-Indian-Healing-Clay/dp/B0014P8L9W/) essentially work the same as pore strips but for your entire face. You apply it

**Closing Thoughts**

* I have no affiliation with the products I listed. You are welcome to substitute your own or recommend products in the comments. The Proactiv system is essentially the same thing (cleanser, but having a routine. Even if you wash your face twice a day with water you will see some results.
* Drink lots of water. Naturally
* If you break out a lot overnight
* I am not a licensed skin professional so please consult a dermatologist if you have skin questions beyond the scope of this guide.",self,t5_2r65t,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/t0yzd/a_guide_to_taking_care_of_your_face/

Since their deep roots in American menswear is part of the reason I love Bean Boots

[But first

I realize these aren't everyone's cup of tea, and when you wear them, they really stand out.  I don't know - maybe you have to have grown up in a place where everyone wore them.

----

**I.  History**

----

The origins of the Bean boot are essentially the origins of the company. [The Bangor Daily News gives one take on the history here](http://tinyurl.com/8kkohsx)
&gt;In 1911, creating a comfortable, functional boot for exploring the Maine woods.
&gt;
&gt;L.L. began his business by working out of the basement of his brother's apparel shop. In 1912

By the 1980s

In 2009
) (a former LL Bean designer who had left to found Rogue's Gallery) to design the new Signature line

However, Lawrence Schlossman (Sartorially Inclined, and How to Talk to Girls at Parties) started a series of guests posts called [The Bean Boot Project](http://tinyurl.com/y92e6ee).  He asked other menswear bloggers to write and post pictures of their experiences with the boots, and lots of them responded.  [This story](http://tinyurl.com/9bce6o9) (from a now-defunct blog called Wingtip) is my favorite -

&gt;My dad has been wearing Bean boots for at least as long as I've been alive.  The same pair.  Worn-in
&gt;
&gt;If I had to guess, when it's muddy, or when it snows (conditions which, for anyone not familiar with Buffalo NY, reflect about 8 months of the year!)  But they are his boots.  The wear and tear reflect his labors.  They're the first and only shoes he puts on before he steps outdoors.
&gt;
&gt;Naturally, a consistent component of the man I look up to the most.  And while I may not be following my father's academic and professional footsteps, you can bet I'll be wearing the same shoes.

Bean boots have always been sewn in Maine by LL Bean employees - they aren't contracted out to third parties, ME ](http://tinyurl.com/ch7ttc) (the same factory that makes the LL Bean boat &amp; totes).  The post has a bunch of stories and [fantastic photos](http://tinyurl.com/8bhon9p), but here's their introduction - 

&gt;Walking into L.L. Bean’s factory in Brunswick, moving through tasks with the grace and ease of highly skilled dancers. It looks like a factory should: a collection of task-specific machines designed by the very workers who use them every day, because, unlike the iconic Bean Boots produced here, you can’t find a triple-stitch machine in a catalogue. Each station has been retro-fitted to suit the assigned employee, right down to decorated oscillating fans and CD players blaring “Bleeding Love,” by Leona Lewis into cheap Chinese headphones; “It’s one way to make it through the day, the zip of the skiving machine

LL Bean has also done some video walkthroughs/interviews of the construction process - [here's one from their own website](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZmL8xZyipY)

----

**II.  Buying Guide**

----

If you're going to order a pair, (3) material of the upper, (4) color, and (5) closure type (all broken out in more detail below).  But if you're buying your first pair, I recommend the [classic 8"" in tan](http://tinyurl.com/9o7bhtk).  

Note that, you'll want to buy a full 1-1.5 sizes below your regular shoe size.  For example, I wear 12.5 in dress shoes, 13 in running shoes, and an 11 in Bean boots, and they're roomy enough for thick wool socks.  [This blog post](http://thesilentist.com/post/2324964074/l-l-bean-boots-a-buyers-guide) suggests not sizing down quite as far for the lined boots.

For care

While I'm a purist


*(1) Height*

They come in seven different heights, but not so high that it's hard to walk in or tuck pants into.  Another versatile choice would be the [low gumshoes](http://tinyurl.com/9c5s9uo), which aren't quite slip-on but work well on damp, misty fall/spring days.  I wear my gumshoes for yardwork a lot, [so they've been out raking leaves quite a bit the last few weeks.](http://i.imgur.com/Bu21V.jpg)

*(2) Lining*

The standard Bean boots are unlined, but I haven't read any reviews or tried on a pair personally.  For rain and all but the deepest, coldest snow,  the standard unlined boots with thick, wool socks are enough.  

*(3)  Upper Material*

In the main line of boots, and the [10"" Maine Hunting Shoes](http://tinyurl.com/9evn62x) have pebble-grain leather (and come in lined and unlined versions).  Over in the Signature line, [there's a waxed canvas version](http://tinyurl.com/8emwftt) (as opposed to leather) available in four colors.  I think these look fantastic, but I'm not sure they'd be as waterproof as the originals.  Still, it's not like waxed canvas is porous or anything.

*(4) Color*

Hands down, and it blends in better with the brown rubber soles, and makes it a little less obvious that you're wearing Bean boots (for good or ill).  They just added an even more ninja-esque [black leather/black rubber version for the mocs](http://tinyurl.com/8njdwk2).  The Signature line has been a little more inventive with colors, and [the waxed canvas version is available in navy, tan, olive and black](http://tinyurl.com/8emwftt).  [There's also a new black leather option](http://tinyurl.com/8l3btb2) Recently, Bean added two boots with red tread instead of the classic gum - in [bison](http://tinyurl.com/8utw3a5) and [tan leather](http://tinyurl.com/9rkfn2l) uppers.

*(5) Closure*

Laced boots are the standard

First thing that happens is that somene in the press stumbles into MFA on reddit and figures out this would make a really good story for the Fashion section of the New York Times or similar.  MFA is very impressed with themselves for this

Not too long after, takes the basic content of entire sidebar, and major threads, and writes a book titled ""/r/malefashionadvice"".  Now reddit is pissed, this guy stole everything people worked on and is selling it for money.  But he changed the words just enough that he can't be stopped.  On the other hand, the book is pretty popular and MFA becomes more popular than ever.  The consistent contributors have reached semi-internet fame.

Media takes notice.  A TV network contacts Veroz

You show up to work/school one day and it turns out 1/2 your class is wearing CDBs.  A girl in the class makes fun of all of you for being MFA drones.  A chinese company starts selling exact clones of AE walnut strands look (of course not quality but nobody can tell!) for $45.  Kohls adds a MFA section in their store with cheap things they claim to be MFA-approved

From hitting mega popularity, migrated to a totally new forum, and started formulating a new generation of style that is just enough tweaked from the masses to avoid being the butt of jokes.

And I'm really pissed because I just spent $350 on Allen-Edmonds Walnut Strands before I realized this is what is about to transpire.",self,t5_2r65t,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/p4hrk/i_have_foreseen_the_future_of_mfa/

**My Objectives For This Guide.**
 
I don't want to get involved in the uniform-debate shitstorm that seems to be raging right now. I am posting this guide because I am currently interested in a certain grungy, workwear/biker style. Hopefully there are other readers with similar interests, or at least readers I can convince that such a style is pretty damn cool; hopefully I can give some good pointers to achieving that style. I have the humble aspiration that this guide will effectively contribute to the diversity of style within MFA.
 
**The look We Want**

Dirty, rugged, scarred, and still kickin’. This look says “I'll probably sleep in my boots tonight and I'll definitely die in them.” It’s the look of someone who’s had to walk long miles through some unfriendly territory and has some miles left to go. The clothes are worn in and wrinkled, the colors are faded, the boots are scuffed and scratched. There’s a bag on the shoulder with everything you need to live another few days.

Dramatic? Sure. It’s a dramatic look

Here are a few pictures of fellow MFAers who I’ve seen looking great in this style. [Cinic](http://i.imgur.com/Edvch.jpg), [LeTigreTigre](http://cdn.dressed.so/i/4f58cd6d55a6fm.jpg), [Trashpile](http://cdn.dressed.so/i/4f4ce2623c367m.jpg). Personally, I think all these outfits would look better the longer they're worn, the dirtier and grungier they get.

[Here](http://imgur.com/a/jvTNf) are a few more modeled inspiration pictures. 
 
 
**How to Get There**
 
We're looking to achieve a certain aesthetic here

**THIS PART IS IMPORTANT:** I want to de-emphasize the importance of pricing and branding in achieving this style. It’s supposed to be affordable. I’m asking you to really live in these clothes. They will look better if you beat them up. The only places you will find a correlation with quality and price is leather goods. Always buy good leather; good leather costs money. In my opinion, all that matters is that you like the cut and the look. If you want Barbour, buy Barbour. If you want UO, buy UO. “Buy the thing you want, not the thing that’s like the thing you want” - Trashpile.
  
* *Boots* are the obvious choice for our military-flavored biker look. The oft-recommended [Katahdin Iron Works Engineer Boots](http://www.llbean.com/llb/shop/49464?page=mens-katahdin-iron-works-engineer-boots) are a solid choice. The brown color will pair well with most of the pants in the next section. Also worth considering would be a pair of black combat boots like [Doc Martens 1490s](http://www.zappos.com/dr-martens-1490-black-smooth). Beat em up, Converse, Keds, or Vans all valid choices.
 
* *Pants* are a pretty versatile category here. Buy a pair of raw denim jeans, but the other denim brands preached here are great too (Nudie, APC, 3Sixteen, Unbranded, etc). Beyond jeans, I like slim-fit cargos for this look. [Dockers Alpha](http://www.dockers.ca/canada/en/feat/alpha-khaki.asp) makes an affordable slim-fit cargo, but keep them generally muted: Khaki, black
 
* *Jackets* are another place for diversity. To play up the military side of this look grab a classic [M65 Field Jacket](http://www.zib-militaria.de/WebRoot/Store8/Shops/61431412/4AAC/BEE8/9EF4/DDF2/CABD/C0A8/2936/E99C/M65RegimentOliv.jpg) or one of its [many modern derivations](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l8eeqkmz2g1qbuw3b.jpg), throw on a [military parka](http://acontinuouslean.files.wordpress.com/2009/03/relwen_aw09_5.jpg). The other major category to look into is *Leather*. Leather jackets are awesome. The classic [Schott Perfecto](http://www.filmjackets.com/VENDORS/SchottNYC/SchottPerfectoFT-lrg.jpg) is a great choice, as would be a [Cafe Racer Moto Jacket](http://clothesbeforehoes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/restoration-hardware-schott-nyc-vintaged-cafe-racer-motorcycle-jacket-01.jpeg). [Temple of Jawnz](http://templeofjawnz.com/) is another widely recommended maker of leather products. Finally, don't overlook the humble Denim Jacket, humbly modeled [here](http://i.imgur.com/qN3am.jpg) and [here](http://i.imgur.com/AXKX5.jpg) by yours truly.
 
* *Shirts* are tricky. In my opinion, and simple, but other dark or muted colors will work as well. Different tees will contribute to different looks. A white crew neck tee will send a very strong 1950s James Dean or Steve McQueen americana vibe, while a long drapy scoop neck tee will push the look forward into darker goth-ninja territory.

Beyond t-shirts, I could imagine some tank tops or scoop necks working as well. The shirt is usually under a jacket, so the key is to allow it to mesh with and accent the outfit as a whole.
 
* *Accessories* and by accessories I mostly mean bags. This is a look that benefits a lot from a bag over the shoulder or hanging from both, most effective route is to pick up a military surplus [backpack](http://www.armynavysales.com/products/jumbo-modular-field-pack/), [Nato Pack](http://www.armynavysales.com/products/medium-nato-style-rucksack/) or [messenger bag](http://www.armynavysales.com/products/medium-nato-style-rucksack/). [This Alice Pack](http://i.imgur.com/oMQLY.jpg), in process of customization with patches from nations I’ve traveled, is my current go-to bag. It’s rugged as shit and pretty comfortable too. That said, anything with that certain beat-up, grungy, look will suffice here. That bag gives you room to tweak the look and is the primary accessory here. As far as other accessories go,,True
