This is the way the world ends

Not with a bang but a whimper.

-The Hollow Men (1925) T.S. Eliot

The poet T. S. Eliot had his own prophetic ideas about how the world might end but scientists have recently seriously speculated on what kind of events could wipe mankind from the universe. Of course an untreatable epidemic is usually mentioned along with encounters with a rogue black hole or an asteroid like the one that killed all the dinosaurs. But one interesting and unusual scenario that results in the destruction of all of mankind is the Hal Scenario in which machines of our own creation take over the world and destroy us all. Could Eliot’s Hollow Men be machines?

Could this really happen? Well personally I think it COULD happen and I think we need to look more carefully at what is being done with our machines of the mind today while we still have some control.

We may have had a taste of the Hal Scenario as recently as May 6, for a few terrifying minutes, in charge of the largest economy on earth.

On May 6, in about 20 minutes. Never in the history of US markets had price dropped so low and so fast. On May 6, the day of flash and crash, more than 19 billion shares were traded across multiple markets and investors lost billions.

This is what it looked like on a chart:

        http://short-term-stocktrading.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/FlashCrash21.jpg                                  
Traders were numbed by the pace of selling and many froze like deer caught in the headlights of an oncoming truck. 

At 2:20 p.m. EDT the Dow was down 400 points.

This was bad

One stock

But the overall market did not stay down long and by 3:09 p.m.

After the close traders walked around in a daze

“I think the machines just took over. There’s not a lot of human interaction, and I think that’s what we saw happen today.”

Was the flash crash a precursor to the Hal Scenario?

Initially the flash crash attracted some attention and President Obama commented briefly on the largest stock market drop in history.

But then the whole event seemed to disappear from the public consciousness. Newspapers stopped running stories about it and nearly two months after the event the many government investigations have failed to explain what really happened. The government went hush hush and basically covered the whole thing up.

But there have been some interesting ideas floating around on the Internet: 

Machines can mimic human thought processes AND emotions through a process dubbed by some as Androgenic Syntactic Analysis or ASA. ASA allows for a smooth conversion between the ways humans think and communicate into binary code which is the way machines and computers think and communicate. 

Using androgenic syntactic analysis the most sophisticated aspects of human intelligence are converted into usable machine language where it can be parsed at lightening speed, and then having them capable of outputting a life time of Einsteins ideas in a millisecond said an unidentified source alleged to be close to the government investigations.

IF it were true it might suggest that the events of May 6

Or perhaps it was just a mistake made by the programmers of these machines

I have argued that machines can understand Wall Street whereas the human mind cannot. Furthermore I have suggested that traders should not try to make subjective stock trading decisions

We traded through the flash and crash with our computers running hot and we emerged more or less unscathed. But perhaps we were just lucky.

But regardless of whether or not you buy into the possibility of the Hal Scenario I think it is clear that thinking machines are alive and well on Wall Street and these thinking machines can and will at times take over our markets. 

If the machines can take over our markets they can take over us.

And if robots are running Wall Street you are going to need a robot for a friend if you want to make money!

This was what was left of America. A desert of endless desolation, bombed us, anything to destroy the infected and keep the plague from their borders. No one knows if it worked. Survivors don’t really get around internationally anymore.

The sun was unforgiving, eager for their next meal. I took another swig from my canteen and walked on.

~

I had been walking for several hours. The sun was beginning its descent down the western sky. It was still fairly bright, sizzling where my arm touched. I struggled to regain my footing and climb out. The walkers behind me had fallen in several at a time, making a sound like sizzling meat. I was able to get out and collapse on the ground. I looked back; I had fallen into a massive glass crater. These things were everywhere, scars of china launching thermite missiles at us. The walkers that had fallen in were sliding to the center, leaving a trail of blood and burned flesh. 

My adrenaline wore off and I felt excruciating pain in my arm. I sat up, cringing in pain. I began wrapping the bandage around it, blood seeping through. I dry swallowed a couple of painkillers and got to my feet. I looked one last time at the crater; the walkers had reached the center, now almost totally skinless, and were slipping and sliding in their own blood. I turned to the west, seeing the smoke again, and walked on.

~

After another hour or so of walking I saw a small shack in the distance as darkness was beginning to fall. It may be a mirage

I made it inside the shack, bolting it with a small piece of rotten wood. I looked around; the shack was too open. Anything could get in at anytime. I heard the shuffling of hundreds of walkers approaching, their feet kicking up a massive dust cloud outside. I frantically searched around, looking for any escape. My fingers found purchase on the ground; a small trapdoor hidden by a layer of sand over it. I pulled it open and dropped inside, immediately greeted by darkness.

I used a small piece of wood I found above with one of my remaining matches to make a crude torch. Luckily, an old revolver still in its hand. I went for the cans, filling my pack and deciding to feast on the canned soup tonight. I took my pocketknife to the can, stabbing a hole into the top. I brought the hole to my mouth, drinking greedily. I savored every drop, committing the flavor to memory.

When I was finished I began setting up my sleeping area, wrapping myself in warmth. The fire crackled, heat slapping my face. I reached for my pack to check my water. Nearly empty. I sighed, I would have to find more tomorrow. I curled into myself, absorbing as much heat as I could, and settled into sleep.

~

I still remember the first time I killed a walker. I had still had a car then, like he was crying. I left the safety of my vehicle to see if he was alright.

Once I was closer I was hit by a horrendous smell, feeling woozy. The man suddenly stood, turning my way and sniffing the air. I panicked and ran back to my car, but newly infected are faster than others as I learned that day.

 He was on me before I could reach my door. He pulled me to the ground, brick in the road. I grabbed it and swung with all my might at the creature’s head. I hit harder than I thought possible, opening a hole in his head. He went limp immediately. Black blood poured from the wound onto the pavement. 

I struggled to me feet, falling like a light rain. I turned to go back to my car and looked back one last time at my handiwork. I felt sick inside, but strangely proud.

This one moment started the change in me.

I woke to a rumbling outside the house. I silently slid from the bed onto the floor. I peeked over the window, only five bullets. Better safe than sorry. 
I opened the door. The men would take at least a minute or two to enter the house. I decided against wasting time setting traps and just took cover on the upstairs balcony

“WHAT THE FUCK?!” one man shouted. He caught his friend’s attention and he jogged inside with the first man.

“What are you going on about?” man number two asked. 
“I walked in and busted these cans full of glass!” he was getting angry at his dim witted companion. He must have been the leader of the two. “so?” The leader’s friend was scratching his head stupidly. “So, rambunctiously announcing where they were and what they were doing with a pointless amount of yelling. 

Easy prey.

I crept down the stairs, not noticing me within a foot of his back. I chopped into his neck, burying the weapon in the flesh. He was halfway decapitated, choking and gurgling on his own blood before dying. Unfortunately he was a heavier than I expected. I tried to catch his body before he hit the ground, but I crumpled under the weight. We fell with a thud that echoed throughout the silent house.

“What was that?!” I heard running steps from the hall. I hastily jumped behind the counter so he wouldn’t see me. I heard the steps stop, so thank you. But there’s only one way out of this house, and you won’t get the chance to use it.” The man acted like he was in control of the situation, like he knew he would get through this. I would prove him wrong.
I poked my head over my cover, striding towards me menacingly. There was no way he had seen me. How could know where I was? He got closer, close enough that I could smell his rancid breath. 

The hell with the silent approach.

I leaped over my cover, feeling a feeling one crack. I tried to block his next attack, but I only succeeded in knocking my hatchet onto the floor. He dropkicked me, I landed on my back. He put his boot on my chest and squatted down to my level. “I told you you wouldn’t get out of here alive little man.” He smiled, showing jagged shards of teeth like broken glass.

Broken glass.

I had to keep him occupied from smashing my skull in. “So that guy over there was your friend” I asked, but why?” I shrugged. “I have another one before I die. What’s leaking blood and won’t help you in the least?” his smile faded. Mine broadened.

“Your eyes!”

He hadnt noticed that with my free hand I had scooped a huge handful of broken glass from the floor while he was laughing. Now I threw it straight into his eyes. He recoiled, blood spurting onto the floor. I did the same to the other leg. He fell to his knees, looking up at me, pleading silently for a show of mercy. I contemplated his fate, he wouldn’t get far with broken legs. Why waste the energy ending his meaningless life? I couldn’t take any chances.

I cracked the crowbar across his face
 
I searched the bodies, and found a pistol holster. I strapped it to my side and gave my pistol a new home besides my backpack.
 
I pulled my binoculars from my backpack, and took a swig of water.

Then I started walking.

	Back in December, sitting in the dark for six hours a day, staring at a screen when I should've been training and hunting, making sure I was ready for the apocalypse that wasn't supposed to happen, that the scientists said the Mayans just made up. But December 21st came, we figured out that it was all too real and we were all going to die.
	I live on my own now. My family and friends are dead. Gone. I'm all alone. I don't miss them anymore. I think it's better to travel alone then in groups. Groups slow you down. Groups kill you. I've seen it all before. Right now I'm travelling across the country to California, too. The Mississippi was destroyed when an enormous sinkhole opened up right in front of the lake that fed it around Christmas day, while everyone was still in mass panic. It now pours into a huge cave system that we never knew existed, instead of trickling down into the Gulf. 
	Right now, in Missouri, in a little kids former bedroom, with ripped up stuffed animals sitting near a box spring, where someone had stolen the mattress, thinking they could use it to survive, long ago. There's some heat left from the fire that I built on the fire escape, and it's already kind of cold. You can tell there's a storm coming when it gets cold here. The clouds seem to gather around the very edges of your vision.
	Whenever I think about my family, and they looked so... delicious. They tried to resist. I just stabbed harder, laughing from insanity, hunger, and just plain joy of not feeling so.. Restricted, like killing was a part of your nature, that you just couldn't help, boiling bone marrow and eating organs for dessert
	Today is my birthday. I celebrated by having liver for cake. The poor girl that it came from didn't even resist me. She was too small, just sitting there while I slit her throat. I didn't want to make her suffer like I did the people that tried to kill me, so I made it quick. I felt awful, for the first time in a while. I sucked some marrow out of a femur for a finishing course. It was delicious. 
	Sometimes
	I sleep under the stars during the summer. When it gets cold I'll use the blanket I made by sewing layers of human skins together. The idea came to me in a spur of the moment thought, so cold. The few people I saw had coats, and I hated them for it. I would kill whoever had a coat, so I could wear it and keep warm. But the coats started to fray. They don't just keep factories going after the apocalypse happens. Eventually, there were less and less people with shirts, then shoes. The coats didn't exist anymore. People wore deer skins. Then the deer were gone, overhunted, one day, making a crude hide, I made sure that it wasn't going to tear
	One time, and stabbed them in the throat, while I sat on top of them so they couldn't get away. It was the longest, most painful death I could think of at the moment. It made me feel so... happy. I realized that everyone has someone who is capable of torture and death inside, no matter who you are.
	That night I had flesh for dinner. I feel sick every time I eat it
	I look up at the sky on clear nights and wonder about who I've become. Am I a cannibal? Am I horrible? Have I done unforgivable things? Yes. I sit there and repeat to myself

1340069307.0,v95hw,Top ways the world could end?,TacoSalad33,15,6,19,"*Dear r/Apocalypse;* There is a lot of talk going on about the end of the world as we know it and as a result we are all getting a bit paranoid or are we? I see that the zombie apocalypse has become a popular ""what if"" these days and I started thinking about other farfetched possibilities that exist. Well I did some research and came up with a list but it is up to you to decide which is the most likely to happen.

*When contemplating this;* Keep in mind that we don't know as much as we think we do and for that reason anything could be possible. Today we implement our imagination in science fiction as well as many other outlets and unknowingly predict the future of civilization and technology. If not for this fact our species might not have come this far. With that stated

**So far our species have imagined the VODs listed below in alphabetical order.** 

*A current total of (19)*

Videos have been linked to the beginning of each VOD for examples. Enjoy! :)

[Alien Invasion;] (http://youtu.be/cg0YsGfCq7o) A invasive extraterrestrial species has discovered us and wants to meat our leader for dinner. *Will we resist?*

[Dinopocalypse;] (http://youtu.be/ZEQoRHrmPVc) Anything can and could go tremendously wrong and for whatever reason a large number of thought to be extinct dinosaurs could resurface and they might wake up terribly hungry one day. It could be anything between a carnivorous beetle that would swarm once excavated or graboids that resurface every 100k years to feast. *Will we stop the invasive dinosaurs?*

[Econopocalypse;] (http://youtu.be/9n29c-q3_8Q) World trade has died as markets crash and banks bail out. All bank accounts across the world have froze and the economy has come to a complete stop as the price of bread has increased over ten thousand dollars. The people are suffering and with no electricity or plumbing they are living in pestilence as well as famine and death. War is the last thing society needs at this point. *Will we rebuild?* [sharprock] (http://www.reddit.com/r/Apocalypse/comments/v95hw/top_ways_the_world_could_end/c52eqxd)

[Global Warming;] (http://youtu.be/oEp382HIisE) The Earth is gradually getting hotter as we begin to lead our lives in a living hell for ignoring the signs. The ice caps have completely melted as regions along every coast have been flooded. Leaving little to no land for life to live on. *Will we continue to deny it?*

[Ice Age II;] (http://youtu.be/FuI5ZtE3lOI) It is possible for our planet to experience another if not worse ice age than last. In the closure of global nuclear war

[Lunapocalypse;] (http://youtu.be/4AmVocfKvPw) Man on the Moon has been tampering with it's surface too much and it has been ruined. As pieces of our moon drift off into space and our tides slow. We all began to feel the stress of a lack of food as the Earth becomes desolate and lifeless in most regions. *Will we wane or wax?*

[Meteor Strike;] (http://youtu.be/GmKWYPWTo9o) The next Asteroid that finds a nice target on our planet may be the last one we ever witness. *Will the bunkers be deep enough?*

[Millennial Storm;] (http://youtu.be/AHGveHs0HPM) In a desperate attempt to thwart global warming we make a mistake by sealing off the Bering Strait and cause a series of ecological events leading to the perfect storm capable of erasing all of human creation. The Millennial Storm would sweep people off their feet. *Will we require diving gear?* *Inspired by:* [Popular Science Magazine July 2012 Issue] (http://www.popsci.com/)

[Monsterpocalypse;] (http://youtu.be/S1NK6zOtg8M) Through experimentation or tampering of nature something didn't go as planned. Now the world is teeming with unforeseen creatures that are causing problems for everyone. Maybe we brought them here. Maybe the E.T.'s did. Perhaps they live in space and migrate through our system every 100k years. Who knows

[Mutant Uprising;] (http://youtu.be/C1SfwPPbkVI) Something has gone wrong in science or maybe we're evolving. The people are mutating and a divide has formed between the people of Earth. *Will we coexist?*

[Oil Crisis;] (http://youtu.be/9n29c-q3_8Q) The peak in oil production has been met and the reserves are low. With barely any fuel to take us to space let alone power the world

[Pole Shift;] (http://youtu.be/FE3yIUsduf4) The Earth's poles suddenly shift a great deal and it's crust trembles heavily through out the world as we all fall through the cracks in a series of super Earth quakes. *Will we hold on?*

[Robopocalypse;] (http://youtu.be/-G3RoBHMu-o) Mankind has dabbled with technology and AI enough to make the forewarned mistake of giving it a body and control over most if not all technology in the world. *Will they bite the hand that feeds?*

[Solar Flare;] (http://youtu.be/crtWfbdGz-4) The Sun and all it's glory has finally produced the solar flare of the millennium and has wiped out all electronics on the globe. Unprepared and dependent on power

[Super Volcano;] (http://youtu.be/7as7Ej_U6yU) The worlds largest and oldest super volcano suddenly becomes active again and gives the Earth a good shaking before purging us all into an ice age. *Will we enjoy fire and ice?*

[Unknown Astronomical Anomaly;] (http://youtu.be/QlGZavEO58g) In the event that a unforeseen astronomical anomaly develops on or near our solar system we are all pretty much screwed! It could be anything really. So lets hope we know as much about space as we think we do or else we could all be sitting ducks waiting for something to erase our existence. *Will we let this happen?*

[Viral Outbreak;] (http://youtu.be/4sYSyuuLk5g) Zombies aside

[WWIII: Global War;] (http://youtu.be/NHWjlCaIrQo) A dramatic situation occurs and Nuclear weapons have been launched. Our homeland among many others have been destroyed. *Will we survive all out war?*

[Zombipocalypse;] (http://youtu.be/NVYP46ecl4Y) The more popular of all the scenarios. A viral outbreak creates a siege of the undead consuming the living. Humanity begins to destroy itself in the most horrific way possible. *Will we survive the horror?*

[This is the end for now;] (http://youtu.be/Z0GFRcFm-aY) If you feel I missed anything feel free to add them in a comment and I will update the list as we continue the discussion. All ""Apocalyptic"" scenarios are welcome so long as it implies a dramatic change in human life and or possible extinction. It also must be a known product of fiction or non-fiction.

1

I stopped at the farmhouse, and the front door was splintered through the entry. I sighed. There probably wasn’t anything worth looting inside, but the sun was beginning its descent below the horizon. The house would have to do. I stepped through the doorway, watching for any movement. I set my backpack on the ground and brought out my tripwires. I lay several discreetly across the doorframe and attached them to a set of tin cans filled with broken glass. Any intruders wouldn’t get inside without making a tremendous amount of noise. 

Something shattered upstairs. I was alert in an instant. It could be anything up there. I pulled my pack around the corner to a small opening in the wall. I took my hatchet from the sheathe
Footsteps. I froze. A body shuffled past the stairs, and turned in my direction. This used to be a man. With a job, paid his taxes, probably had a girlfriend. Now just another body. While I thought of his past, he fell on me. We tumbled down the stairs, grappling. We hit the bottom; I struggled to clear the stars from my eyes. The thing strained to bring its decayed teeth to my arm, at which point I kicked out, then I brought my hatchet down on the thing’s snarling face until it stopped twitching. Brains leaked from its shattered skull.

I searched the body. Cigarettes. That would fetch a decent price at Container Town. I grabbed my pack and headed back upstairs. I turned into the bedroom and shut the door behind me. A body lay on the floor
Just another day in hell. 

~

My name is Marcus Jones. The world ended on May seventeenth of two-thousand and eleven around two-thirty PM. I was working at my office

The suddenly all the keyboards stopped. I curiously peered over my cubicle and everyone had moved to the television in the lounge. I stood up and walked to the throng of my coworkers, sickly. His eyes looked panicked, erratic. The secret service had weapons drawn surrounding him in a semi-circle. I then noticed a tear in his suit that cost more than my apartment. The tear was bloodstained and the flesh underneath was almost black, pulsing with what looked like an infection of some sort. 

He was apologizing on live television, seemingly struggling to remain conscious. He suddenly went into a fit of coughing, shaking violently, before standing more slouched than before. He took the mask off, revealing bloodshot eyes and foam frothing at his mouth. He looked ravenous now. He looked to the nearest secret serviceman with a crazed hunger in his eyes. 

My coworkers and I were beginning to realize this wasn’t a joke. Then the screaming started. The president had sunk his teeth into the secret serviceman’s throat. Blood spurted the camera, giving us a view of a man with his throat torn open by his leader’s teeth. Most of my coworkers had left in a panic, their screeching tires being the only farewell they gave. The more strong willed of us continued watching, struggling to keep our lunches inside us. The body on screen began stitching, and stood up. It shuffled over the camera, cutting our live feed to a mess of static. I ran from the lounge, across the lobby, I passed people begging for rides, even hurling themselves at my car. I kept driving. 

I finally reached my apartment. I ran inside, pre-packed with all the essentials. The house now held nothing of value. I went back to my car and drove away. I didn’t know where I was going, just away. Away from all of this madness. Away from everything. 

I will survive this. By any means necessary.

The ever increasing probability, and complexity of disaster when technology fails us.

  This has been a problem that has been growing in my mind for a few years now. Humans as a species thrive through our ability to manipulate the environment around us, a world that has a infinitely different number of technologies for every one of our creature comforts.  Each based upon improving current levels of comfort, efficiency, and ease of use.  it is this last one that is perhaps the root of all future issues. 

 The fact that we as a culture expect everyone to utilize the most current form  of technology, with each generation born into this ever increasingly complex world of computers and cell phones and microchips, they don't need to know HOW this technology works. Nor do they learn how the previous levels of technology worked.  I suppose we are lucky in this sense, starting right after the first world war, we began handing out technology to the masses, and for the first time the user didn't need to know how it worked or why it didn't.  Before then if the operator of say a steam engine, which by today's standards is an extremely simple machine, then he or she would in all probability be killed or seriously maimed by it.

  The majority of all technologies employed by the populace,"" rely on one singular power source... ELECTRICITY.  There are several issues that could arise within the use of this power source. All of them, high voltage transmission wires, power stations, the availability of fuel sources, are extremely sensitive, and extremely inefficient.  In our all consuming effort to produce more power we destroy the environment around us. This environment isn't just the woodlands, it is also the ozone layer above us, not just for now, and the grid.

  So here lies the biggest issue, what now?  Yes, there are those of us that could salvage what we have left to make do. Do you know how to forge steal? Do you know how to build the tools necessary to do so?  What about feeding the populace? Most people take for granted that their will always be an abundance of food, do you know how to grow your own food?

  The entertainment industry likes to make what if programs and scenarios, life.

  If we as a species truly wish to survive this inevitable disaster, this beacon of light and truth, we spend trillions of dollars investing in newer and better ways of killing each other, problem? We cannot fight, force or will our way through this. Human understanding, humility, and cooperation is the only way forward.",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Apocalypse/comments/1ig9r3/technology_is_not_our_salvation_people_are/

My eyes opened, and began searching the room now that I had more light. My fire had left a spot on the floor blackened. The rest of the room was in more or less good condition. The shelf had one furry lump that looked like it used to be an apple, and the walls were bare besides a small cabinet.
 
I went to the cabinet to look for anything useful when I heard a rustling inside it. I brought out my hatchet, I swung my hatchet, swiftly decapitating the animal. I looked down at the body, still bleeding from it’s neck stump.

Squirrel.

I was shocked. I hadn’t seen much wildlife around. When the dead started walking most animals just disappeared. Either hunted to extinction or migrated to Canada and Mexico. The squirrel was thin

I dug in, I hadn’t had real meat in months. Flavor burst into my mouth, more flavor than anything I had tasted since I found the cattle farm several months ago. Before long the squirrel was gone besides a few stains of blood on my fingers, and I licked those clean too. I collected the bones to sell once I got to Container Town, Mickey always liked bones of any kind.

I gathered my pack, listening for any disturbance topside. When satisfied that I was more or less safe I opened the door.
Light blinded me momentarily
A distant gunshot startled me. I turned toward the sound

~

I had been walking for at least an a few hours now. My legs ached. I reached for my canteen and brought it to my mouth

I thought back to how I got here in the first place. A simple scavving job from Container Town, almost falling.

The dehydration mirages started. I saw a green oasis, at least thirty feet high. Shots rang out around me, dust kicked up around my feet. I felt an impact in my arm, red swarmed my vision. I dropped to my knees.

The gates scraped open, shouting all at once. The darkness came for me, wrapping my body in shadow. I felt cold death pour down my throat. I tried to resist, but failed. I gave in.

Darkness enveloped me

~

Clarity. 

My head cleared, metallic, looking rough to the touch. My eyes could make out more of my surroundings now. I lay on the floor, a small blanket between me and the ground. 

A small shadow at least half my size came towards me

I scuttled backwards until I met the wall. The figure shambled in my direction, I felt it come loose. I struggled to form words from my broken jaw when I saw the attacker’s hand come up again now holding a half full bottle. 

It shattered across my face

“Sit the fuck down Marcus. I’m the doctor.”

A woman’s voice. Definitely not the doctor. I pushed my jaw back into place

“You aren’t the doctor. Where’s Leonard?”

She shrugged

I struggled to my feet

She finished fiddling with the pulleys in the corner, barely reaching her startlingly blue eyes. She smiled, her lips curling upward in a way that made my knees wobble. She extended her hand at stomach level. She was significantly shorter than me.

“Sydney

At that moment my flawless social skills kicked in and I blurted

Her fist connected with my crotch with surprising force. I collapsed to my knees

She turned away. “I prefer the term ‘small person, blinding me. I held up a hand to stop the light. As I stepped into the white Sydney’s voice echoed behind me.

I put it on facebook and it has had about 200 shares so I thought some people here might find it useful.

My Original Post -&gt; http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151320120839311

{{{4th Graders -&gt; Maya -&gt; Apocalypse}}}

 This morning I received this text message (below) from a grade school teacher friend who is frustrated:

 ""Btw! Why did your little friend translate the Mayan texts and freak people out?! I've got a bunch of 4th graders that keep freaking about the end of the world!"". 

 Well this really bothered me. I know plenty of adults are freaking out about the whole ""Maya Apocalypse"" thing on Friday

 So this begs the question: Just why is everyone freaking out (and why do I care)? Well the main reason I care is that a lifetime ago it seems (and I guess 26 years is heading in that direction) I considered myself a Maya archaeologist and I had the opportunity to work with some of the greatest minds in the field of Maya archaeology at the Maya site of Copan in Honduras and several other sites in the Maya region. Working with these people left a big impression in me and has helped to fuel my desire to do my small part to set this story straight.

 So just why are people freaking out? The main reason is that if you listen to the media many outlets will tell you ""The Maya said the world will end on Dec 21st!"" which then leads into whatever story they want to push that night. But have you EVER actually read what the Maya said about the world ending? Thanks

 This is what the text that has so many all riled up actually says. It is translated by the well respected Maya epigrapher David Stuart (who was one of my classmates back in Copan):

 ""The Thirteenth Bak'tun"" will be finished (on) Four Ahaw

 OH MY GOD! I WAS WRONG IT SAYS THE WORLD WILL… wait a minute… I must have missed something. Nope. You read it right. At no point does this simple bureaucratic text say anything about the end of the world. It really is that simple. Trust me

 You can stop reading here

 Several important nerdy things to note:

 1: Bak'tuns are really long periods on a calendar
 2: We are currently living in the 13th Bak'tun of their calendar (which means there were 12 before this one).
 3: The Maya make references to dates on other calendars far beyond the 14th Bak'tun (14th is the name of the next Bak'tun cycle that starts on Saturday).
 4: Just like we have said things like ""our calendar ends on December 31st, etc…) we don't feel the need to then say, ""but then it begins again on January 1st of the next year."". This is just like what the phrase in the Maya text ""The Thirteenth Bak'tun will be finished (on)"" means. That 13th calendar cycle is ending, the Maya did not feel the need to mention that the 14th Bak'tun starts the next day on our Saturday. Heck they were carving this stuff in stone, they needed to be concise with their words!
 5: What is the most future date you have ever heard? For lots of you it is what Fergie sung in the song Boom Boom Pow. Fergie sings ""Im so 3008
 6: The stelae (sculpture) this is from is fragmented (see the picture)
 7: The descent thingy they reference is perfectly normal for the Maya to talk about and likely is referring to a statue(s) they would bring down (descend) from the top of a pyramid and parade around.
 8. The Nine Support Gods are likely these characters who routinely are referenced on other calendars. They are perfectly normal in the Maya mythology.

 [MY PROMISE] So where does that leave the 4th graders of the world? I will extend the same offer to all them in the Internet enabled world that I made to my friends class this morning. I PROMISE that if the world ends on Friday I will buy your entire class ice cream next week! (Please note

 Disclaimer: I wrote this rather quickly with a sick toddler interrupting me. So there might be some technical errors in this (sorry about that Dave!)

People saw it as a sanctuary of sorts. Massive walls, making them into houses, shops, even an armory. One day an old bartender cut into what would be his new bar, and discovered a body. It was pretty much a skeleton by now, and everyone knew the story of how Container Town came to be, so everyone assumed it was the body of The Founder. The Founder’s body was buried in the town square. The bartender found a cross on him and keeps it hanging above his new bar

I found Container Town on my way down the coast looking for boats. I had barely any supplies so all I could do was keep walking until my body fell. I saw the walls from nearly half a mile away
Once I was safely over the wall I was greeted by a sudden silence. I had heard footsteps milling about but that had ceased when I touched the ground. I took my hatchet from the sheathe

When I came to I was surrounded by angry townsfolk with an assortment of weapons. They questioned me, be it reinforcing the wall or running out for supplies.

Now I was finally home. After two weeks of scavving the wasteland I had gathered enough supplies to warrant a return trip. 

~

The rusted shells of containers greeted me when I emerged from the holding area Sid had me in. people milled about, the smells, the life.
I had never felt more out of place with the living.

I made my way to the trading post near the main gates. I pulled back the curtain that served as a door,” I shouted into the building. I stepped past the curtain, looking at the thirteen-year-old that served as my boss.

“Get your fuckin’ dumb ass in here Marcus! Who the fuck do you think you are coming and going whenever the fuck you want!” Joey was a little asshole. His parents getting killed turned him into a hard ass. When he arrived at Container Town one guy treated him like a baby

“Well!? Do you have anything to show for your shitty efforts to make this town a better place,” I told him. 

Joey took the watch in his grimy little hands as I sat at the table. His voice rang out suddenly. “There’s blood on this watch Marcus. Kill anyone interesting

Joey shook his head. He held his hands up in air quotes. “Just some raider? Bullshit.” He reached into his pouch, bouncing them off my chest. I reached down to collect them.

“Get the fuck out of here Marcus

I leaped up and grabbed the little bastard by his neck,” I growled. Joey squirmed in my grasp, struggling for breath. I saw his hand go for the knife in his boot, which took after removing one hand from his throat and held just out of his reach. I looked into his eyes. “Are you afraid boy?”

“MARCUS!” 

I looked to the doorway

I shrugged. “If you insist sir.” I threw the boy away. He landed hard on the table

Marshall sighed. “Come on Marcus. We should go.” He stepped aside so I could pass, drawing blood, before firmly planting itself in the wall behind him with a solid thud. He spat and swore at meas I turned to leave, Marshall sighed before pushing me out the doorway.

~

Marshall was what qualified for a Sheriff in Container Town. He kept people from killing each other and in return the Town let him do whatever the fuck he wanted. Marshall always looked down at his “Civilians” like a Sheppard keeping his brain damaged sheep from mistakenly wandering into a wood chipper. 

I'm no saint, with Marshall on the losing side most of the time.

Now he holstered his gun and shoved me into the street

“Marcus

Now I removed my coat and weapons as well. I laughed. “You don’t seem to understand the situation Marshall. Your empty threats don’t intimidate me in the least. If you keep going

Marshall smiled wickedly
“This is your last warning Marcus!”

I smiled back.

“No Marshall

He charged me, wild. I ducked under his fist while grabbing his knee, throwing it to the side. Marshall lost his balance and fell to the ground, kicking up dust where he collapsed. The crowds cheered, as they had all been abused by Marshall at some point and, to be frank, were sick of his shit. 
Marshall climbed to his feet, digging my teeth into his flesh. He screamed, released me from his bear hug, and tried to tear me off his shoulder. 

He succeeded only in worsening the damage, the darkness in my eyes showing clearly.

“Marshall

“-Your official retirement.” I crushed his hand

He wailed, swearing vengeance, just his usual bullshit. He actually turned to the crowd, begging for someone, anyone's aid. 

 His pleas for help fell on deaf ears.

1302307650.0,glv24,Sick of high gas prices? Fight back!,djtomr941,1,0,0,"As oil consumers let's fight back against, easy money policies fueling massive inflation. Please forward this on. We can fight back if we all do this together and also hopefully put some more money back into our pockets and not in those of Wall Street or the oil companies!

We need to show big corporations and big government that we will not be pushed around. All of us working together can make a difference. We can speak with one voice.

What does not work? 

Not buying oil from any specific company for a day doesn't really do anything since oil is a global commodity and buying it elsewhere does not reduce demand.

What will work. Reducing demand.Prices are determined by supply and demand. There is no supply and demand problem. But

Driving strike.

Pick 2 days a week or more and do no driving. This can be a weekend or a weekday it does not matter.  

Instead carpool, take a bike, or do something at home. This will have the biggest impact.

We use 18 million barrels of oil per day. If we can knock a day off our demand then that would add roughly 80-100 million barrels of gasoline to supplies which would pop the oil bubble. Current inventories are roughly 350 million barrels (which is at the higher levels we have ever had). 450 million would push speculators out of the market and make them take that cheap FED money and put it elsewhere. When you do drive

1.  Work from home if your company allows you too.
2.  Get a more fuel efficient car. Many now will allow you to double your gas mileage.
3.  If you are a company
4.  Time trips to avoid traffic. Get to work early/late and leave early/late.
5.  Take public transportation if you can.
6.  Use map software to avoid traffic jams. A large amount of gas is wasted by idling vehicles.
7.  Turn off your car rather than let it idle.
8.  Drive less aggressively. Momentum is energy
9.  Properly inflate your tires and if the check engine light is on
10. 55mph is the sweet spot. Every 10mph over the limit is 10% less fuel economy. Driving 85mph is dangerous and wastes 35% of your gasoline. You may also get a ticket.
11. Car pool with people from work if you can.
12. Intelligently plan your trips. Try to get everything in a set of stops.
13. Use Gasbuddy.com to find the lowest gas prices in your area.

This only deals with the demand situation. To increase supply, representative, and even your President and tell him/her that you aren't happy with how our energy policy is being handled. Please add your own thoughts. Drilling for more oil will not bring prices down immediately, not like reducing demand will, however we can all benefit in the long term.

the most likely apocalypse would be...

evolved virus: this is now a days a pretty popular prediction for an apocalypse, and spreading the virus.

 if this were to happen our best chance to survive is to not go to a secluded house

 you would want to get to a meat locker

explosives:
 you would want to make your own grenades so you can restock fast. a good grenade is to get a glass jar with alot of nails and bolts and get a few bullets for the charge you would use to activate your grenade.

take the gun powder out of the bullet and wrap it in plastic wrap and tap it towards the center of the jar

weapons: 
dont use guns because the noise would only draw in more infected

the best weapon you can probably get is a self-cocking crossbow since you can use the arrows A.K.A bolts to stab when up close or shoot them from a distance.

 a back up in case your pinned or cant get to your crossbow would to have a knife with any holes throughout the blade, its VERY important you dont try to dismember an infected, the blade will cut in the bone and get stuck.

for a blunt weapon you should get an aluminum bat and and mold concrete towards the top

transport:
this one is gonna be fun, and move quick and quiet. cars make too much noise and bikes...lets not go there.

moving on foot is the best option since it helps raise your endurance and stamina while being the most quiet way. dont get attached to one of your hideouts because your gonna be moving alot to lower your chances of infected stumbling across you.

misc. helpful tips:
lets say your trying to leave a building and theres a few idle infected standing there

if that situation happens

if any of you plan to hold onto your good morals when the shit hits the fan then your not gonna like me in this next part. if theres a group of infected coming and theres some asshole whos hassling you for whatever reason you would have to do this so your live

trading is a good way to meet new allies and get useful items for yourself

armor:
for armor...ill let you have fun with that part.

this is all i can think of right now and i hope this is helpful in some ways.",self,t5_2qhnj,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Apocalypse/comments/1imf2k/how_to_survive_in_the_most_probable_apocalypse/

I want to edit an anthology of Post-Apocalyptic stories, all during or after the apocalypse. 

The problem I'm facing is getting this project going, etc. I JUST put this project up and I'm getting nowhere, but I think this project would be awesome so I'm working on getting it spread across the interwebs. 

If you could support by backing in a small tier (the lowest is 3 bucks for the volume 1 e-book) that'd be incredible. I hate doing this, have suggestions or concerns, or anything else. Thankya!

My username is NexusXtremeOne

I got out of college just when the economy crashed. I'm sure many here have experienced the problems described in the most recent issue of Newswseek (http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2012/07/15/are-millennials-the-screwed-generation.html) Upset

Then I saw this: (http://2wanderlust.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/futurism-got-corn-graph-631-thumb.jpg?w=450&amp;h=368)

From the day we were born, and everyone was special. Tyler Durden elaborated upon it:

&gt;*""I see in fight club the strongest and smartest men who've ever lived. I see all this potential, waiting tables; slaves with white collars. Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don't need. We're the middle children of history, man. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our Great War's a spiritual war... our Great Depression is our lives. We've all been raised on television to believe that one day we'd all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars. But we won't. And we're slowly learning that fact. And we're very, very pissed off.""*

Long story short: Our generation and our future is doomed to the same scenario John B. Calhoun created in his mouse utopia.

That is why I am making this proposal. An alliance between subreddits with the aim of finding salvation for our generation and world. The Occupy movement has good ideas
