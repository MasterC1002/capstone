* Keep a small trashcan in your bathroom for ladies you have over
* Do you tend to get sweaty on your morning commute via public transportation or walking? Don't put on your tie until you get to your office building. Do it in a restroom and use the chance to run a comb through your hair. Your shirt collar will stay cleaner

* Keep a Leatherman on your person (not with a suit)
* Don't get emotional about shit
* Exercise, even the happiest person on earth would be happier if they were in shape. Being strong is a great feeling, don't give excuses like ""I'm happy with myself as I am."" That's called complacency, always strive to be better, stronger, faster, smarter
* Buy a styptic pencil, a funeral, a wedding... it cleans up the spot
* Never let a woman see you worry. ~Frank Sinatra
* Don't boast about anything you have done
* When nature bestows upon you a precipitation free sunny day, you shall cook meat and meat alone, any vegetables shall only be prepared to make the meat taste meatier

* **Learn to drink and appreciate the basic drinks** - This includes beer, but they are all acquired tastes and you will get used to them. When your boss, friend, future father-in-law offers you a glass of nice wine, scotch, or beer, you will not want to have to say no and look weird. So start drinking, but you'll be thankful that you got used to it. Their is no way around this one

* **Have a (few) ""usual(s)""** - find a drink which you enjoy drinking and that is easy for a bartender to make (ex. whiskey coke, etc.). Don't be the guy that stands at the bar not knowing what he wants and having everyone wait on him. You don't have to drink this every time, just know it to be ready if you have to make a quick decision. 

* **Have a ""usual"" beer for every occasion** - feel out the situation you are in. If you are at a dive bar and the only things that they have are domestic drafts, know which one you like best (for me, it is Coors Light, it might not be the best beer, however, I never hesitate when there is a crowded bar and the bartender plus half the bar is waiting for me to make a decision. If the situation calls for nicer beer (e.g. draft houses, specialty beer bars, they like beer). Personally, Krokenberg, ask about drink specials

* **Don't be scared to order what another is having** - If you are in a situation where you don't know what to drink and you don't want to make a fool of yourself, that's why you have one, or maybe even go with what's on special. 

* **Tipping** - Don't be a douche. I usually like opening a tab, tip at least $1 a drink (depending on the cost of the drink and the niceness of the place). After you get the change, just leave it next to your spot or where the bartender gave you the change. They may not act like they notice... but they do. Remember, if you tip well, the bartender will make stronger drinks. If you are worried about the bartender cheeping out on drink strength, remember that beer can't be watered down. P.S. in my experience, I like having guy bartenders. Tipping them well works better because women expect better tips

* **Know your limits** - This might sound a little churchy and ""alcohol EDU""-ish, however, this is real life and there will come a situation in which it is inevitable. .08 is MUCH easier to get to than you expect, know how much you can take before hitting it. Buy a breathalyzer if you must or use a [chart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_alcohol_content) and undershoot. **A DUI is always much more expensive than a cab.** Most bars will allow you to keep your car overnight without towing it. 

This is not an all inclusive list

 It is painfully obvious when you are drinking with someone who has no clue how to drink. It is also very embarrassing to be the odd man out when in a group. A little practice is well worth not being that guy.

EDIT 1:

I'm glad a lot of you like what I wrote and others are discussing it. I like getting people to talk and analyze

Clarification 1: By no means am I saying that not drinking is off the table. I saw that some people were concerned about this in the comments and I want to clear up that not drinking is completely fine. After seeing this, big group, meeting strangers) then they usually just come up with an excuse for that one time. Anything from driving to ""not feeling it."" 2) if in a more intimate environment (e.g. smaller group of friends, lounge place with low music, outdoors) then they usually say that they don't drink. Both the guys I asked told me that if you do chose to say that you don't drink, be prepared to respond to ""why?"". It is not fair or right that people have to give excuses, but sadly

Clarification 2: My suggestion of not being scared of ordering what another is ordering is more for when you find yourself in a foreign situation. My best example (and the reason I've put this rule on myself) is when you go to a bar that probably doesn't have your ""regular"" drink (e.g. hole in the wall bars, I learned so much more and got to taste some pretty amazing drinks because I just asked whomever I was with what they were having. This suggestion is more of a ""don't be scared to get out of your comfort zone."" I hope this helped clarify this too.",,False,self,t5_2u82c,1374516039.0,,

Dancing is important skill for all men to know which transcends into several aspects of life.  Learning how to dance will build your confidence, social skills, coordination, keep you fit and so much more.  Not to mention that at some point you are going to be put into a situation where knowing how to dance will be vital; weddings, parties, social functions, ect. 

The key to dancing well is being confident and having fun. However
You can either practice in private.  I am going to be providing links for learning how to do the salsa, and they will meet regularly.

You'll roast the **chicken** and ravage the body like an animal for one night's meal. The next night you'll have a bunch of leftover meat still on the carcass, or something like that with the meat. The third night, nothing left? What's on the menu? Fucking **soup**'s on the menu. Now, in the previous two nights you better not have thrown out any bones or skin or gross chicken bits. You keep that shit for your soup ([which I elaborate on here](http://www.reddit.com/r/everymanshouldknow/comments/1iyrog/emsk_how_to_roast_a_chicken_with_beer/cb9d524)).

Back to the roast:

I'm going to recommend **beer** can chicken because it's easy, apparently some people think this is a sham, I can't testify to the thermodynamics of cooking, all I know is this makes a mean chicken. 

Here's how it plays out: 

* Put the oven on like 350 F

* Get your chicken and wash it off and get any gross bits out of it

* Cover the chicken in whatever the fuck you want and massage that into the raw chicken's creepy skin. Salt, but I'm recommending dousing it in cajun spice which you can buy or [make easily](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/cajun-spice-mix-2/) (basically just throw spoonful of paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, cyanne pepper, oregano, thyme, and pepper together)

* Empty about a third of a beer can into a bowl. Or drink it. And plop the beer can on a baking tray, put your chicken down on the can and shove the can up it's ass. Think of that south park episode when Mr. Slave sits on that horrible celebrity until she's up his ass. I love chicken skin (especially in cajun spice), and one of the good things about this method is that all of the skin gets nicely evenly roasted if it's sitting up, as oppose only one side like when you lay it down as you usually do. 

* Throw some cut up garlic down the chicken's open neck hole and see if you can use the skin cover the hole so it all hotboxes in there. You might have to sew it back using something. 

* Put it in the oven for an hour and think about how awesome it's going to be. 

* Come back after an hour and throw some potatoes, and onion quarters in with the chicken on the tray. It's better if it's a bowl-like tray so the veggies roll around in all the juices/beer. Also, if you didn't drink the beer, dump that beer on the chicken now.

* Come back after another hour and pull it out of the oven. *Do not touch it.* Don't you fucking touch it. Or pick at it. Or peel at it. Just let it sit there for 10 minutes. Eat a potato if you want. 

* Alright, but if you do it's really no big deal, you just get an extra-beery gravy along with your veggies. 

* Eat it all AND DON'T LOSE ANY OF THE BONES. Those are for soup.

Now invite a lovebuddy over for dinner and make 'em a fucking roast chicken. 

I know picking up a full chicken isn't the cheapest thing, not just the one.

Also, I probably wouldn't take anything away. Keep in mind also that

**BASIC TOOL KIT**

I doesn't have to be anything major or expensive. All you need is a sturdy container with the following contents inside:

Socket set/ratchet, Philips size #1 and #2, pair of regular slip joint pliers and a pair of needle-nose and locking pliers, adjustable crescent wrench, wire cutters/stripper, hammer, an assortment of extra fuses, gloves

**BASIC FIRST AID KIT**

Again, I'd make sure the First Aid Kit is small enough to toss in it without too much trouble. Anyway at a minimum, I would include:

Bandages (assorted Band-Aid type), antibiotic ointment, scissors, first aid tape, tweezers, alcohol swabs, elastic bandage, pain relievers and burn ointment.

Here is a particularly good opportunity to show your good judgement, so I would include some antacid. If you're trained in emergency medical or whatever, by all means add more stuff to utilize your abilities. Maybe you're ok but someone else needs help, be a Good Guy.

**Emergency Kit**

Not everyone will need this. This is mostly for people to take long trips or those who live out in the middle of nowhere. Again, that way you have a convenient way to carry the items and water.

550 Cord, food stuffs, poncho, signaling mirror/whistle, fire starting
Material, dry socks and sturdy footwear, good fixed blade knife.

**In the Trunk/Cargo Area**

Put whatever kits above you use and the following: A real jack, a gallon of antifreeze/coolant, folding shovel, can of Fix-a-Flat, empty fuel can, large water container-full of fresh water (for drinking-fill your Camelbak with it if you use it). 

**In the Center Console/Glovebox**

This items you will want to be able to reach from the driver's seat:

Emergency Egress Tool, map. Also, a bottle of Acqua Di Gio (or at least a thing of Axe) and a pack of gum, because this post isn't about survival as it about what Men should have in their vehicle.

On a similar note, razor/gel, deo and whatever Manly Soap you use. Putting this in a gym bag with an extra set of clean whatever-you-wear-to-work would be ideal.

1. Ask in advance

2. Remember they are helping you out so make it as easy as possible for them to do so. Accommodate them as much as possible. Your friend is helping you move but he doesn't have a car? Go pick him/her up and drive back to your place

3. Be ready to start when you say you are going to start. If you get your friend to help you paint your living room and say Sat. at 2 pm be ready to roll at 1:30. Don't get out of bed at 2pm half hungover and go down to the hardware store to pick up the brushes and paint. 

4. Try to pay them back in some small fashion right then and there. After they help you move into your new place/paint the room invite them to stay and spring for the pizza and beer. 

5. Verbally thank them for their time and efforts. ",self,t5_2u82c,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/everymanshouldknow/comments/1bazvl/emsk_favor_etiquette/

You'll need:
Drywall tape (repair type
A sanding pad (open pore
Drywall mud (light and heavy for larger holes
Dust mask
A small trowel
A larger trowel
Texturing sponge (if necessary)
Utility knife
Gloves
Goggles or safety glasses

For any hole in drywall it is a good idea to clean up the edges of the hole using a utility knife

For small holes (fist sized to 2 inches in diameter) I'd recommend using a fiber, take care not to push too hard, the tape needs to stay in place.  Your trowel should be larger than the hole you're repairing.  Once you've got a good base layer on, wait for the mud to dry a bit (edges will start to turn white) then, apply a second, thinner layer of your heavy mud, wait for this to dry a bit more fully.  After over half of the hole has dried to white apply an even coating of the lightweight mud and wait for it to dry completely.  Once dried, try to avoid heavy repetitive strokes

Gouges and deep scratches require only lightweight mud and a steady hand to repair.  Fill the gouge in multiple stages to prevent cracking of the mud compound

Large holes can be conquered as well

Because you never know when you will meet that incredible lady. The one you pull out all the charm for. Because you feel you are punching above your weight. The one you inevitably want to invite back to your house, cooked by you, at your house. Somehow, watching a man cook in the kitchen is actually sexy to women. I know, doesn't make much sense to me either.

Now the meal can be anything. But it needs to be cooked with expertise. With her watching. While you are entertaining her with small talk. A man who can cook an exceptional meal almost effortlessly, until you can do it without thinking.

I like pasta. Fresh pasta from the refrigeration aisle. Not the dried out shit. Start with plain pasta sauce in a bottle. It already tastes good and is hard to screw up. Then make the pasta sauce your own. Add red wine. Explain to her that the heat will evaporate the alcohol. Let it bubble.  Tell her you chose a Cabernet Sauvignon, garlic, onion (basically whatever you like) sauteing. Learn how to saute. Flip those shrooms by flicking the pan just right. All while telling her that funny story you know. Once ready, everything goes in the sauce. Put the pasta in the boiling water. Add whatever herbs you like to the pasta sauce. Dont forget salt and pepper. Let the pasta sauce simmer and smell good. Fill up her wine glass. Bonus points if you had home made garlic bread in the oven. Chop up some more of the bread to go with the meal and set the table. Then pull out the salad you threw together before she came over (made with the pre-cut weird green shit that only rabbits like but is always found in expensive restaurants.) Lastly, and most importantly of all is the presentation. Drain the pasta when it is al dente (which means whenever the fuck you want.) Put the pasta carefully on the plate, then artfully arrange the pasta sauce on top. Add black pepper (from a grinder) and cheese to taste. Maybe a sprig of something green on top.

1.  [Square knot](http://youtu.be/cuNwp_Pi33s) -- Useful for joining two short lines to make a longer line.  Do not confuse this with the much weaker [granny knot](http://youtu.be/AW3mUtSC1l0)!  Granny knots are bad.

2.  [Bowline](http://youtu.be/Q9NqGd7464U) or [Double Figure 8](http://youtu.be/AZUC132qE2Y) -- Makes a loop that won't slip.  Good for rescue work.  Most climbers prefer the double figure 8 ([here is a video on tying a double figure 8 in the end of a line for climbing](http://youtu.be/WakZ-77Ie3c)).  If you use a bowline make sure to leave extra line off the end in case it slips.  Many rescue professionals recommend a foot of extra line at the end if you use a simple bowline for rescuing somebody.  [The lightening method of tying a bowline](http://youtu.be/H85cMlvwwXA) could save your life some day.  [Here is the lightening method in action](http://youtu.be/BJAd-NSkLjA).

3.  [Tautline hitch](http://youtu.be/eG-xZFUVR-M) -- This is the most versatile camping and tie down knot I know.  It lets you tighten or loosen a loop and have it stay.  This is useful for holding down a tarp or connecting your tent to your tent stakes.  There are other similar friction knots that are sometimes better for a situation

To learn these

----------------------------------------------------------------

Further study:

After you know these knots it's good to know a stopper knot like the [Ashley stopper](http://youtu.be/oUSidC2AenY)

If you want to really get into knotwork I recommend the [Ashley Book of Knots](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0385040253).  It's the knotwork bible.  If it's not in the ABOK it's probably not a knot.

If you want to get into pretty knots or knot theory, but the web site specializes in knotwork and rope safety for BDSM.  I won't link to it here because some of it is NSFW, but most of it is SFW tutorials on some really cool knots.  Google for it if you are interested.

Most people feel it is the epitome of awkwardness and to a lesser extent loneliness, but even if you get caught with them at a movie at home this information can still apply.

1. Don't be awkward yourself: keep conversation and help your friend move the date from one part to the next (if they can't decide on a place to eat

2. Bring a friend if you can and it's appropriate: there is some safety in numbers if you can get a friend (preferably a girl). The problem with having a guy is that it can turn into a bro-fest and then the girl feels left out

3. Your job is to act as a kind of wing-man: This isn't in the traditional sense as we believe it, it can help the remind the girl what she really likes about him.

4. KNOW WHEN IT IS YOUR TIME TO LEAVE: there is no obligation for you to stay with them at all times and when you see the girl or guy showing signs of.....for lack of a better term.... getting frisky

5. The job of a third wheel is a lonely one...or is it: the act of third wheeling doesn't have to be the epitome of loneliness. I always used it as an excuse to get out and be social (seeing as my friends generally invite me to third wheel cause I'm good at what I do). You can always meet someone where you're going and the two others save you from that ""I should just go home"" syndrome that unsocial people (like me unless I try really hard) fall into.

1361215644.0,18rmjz,EMSK: Shaken vs. Stirred,Map_of_piano,50,10,12,"This is copied from the packet I give when training staff for a bar

Shaking Cocktails: 
	
Any drink containing eggs, and properly combine eggs and dairy with the spirits. 
Additionally, then add ice, and shake again. This is done to achieve the proper foamy texture egg whites provide. 	
Shaking is meant to be violent. You should put a lot of strength into the shake
All shaken cocktails should be double strained, and pulp from the drink.

Stirring Cocktails:

When a drink contains no eggs, it should be stirred. Drinks containing only spirits (like a Manhattan) are ALWAYS stirred unless the customer requests otherwise. The one exception to this is the vodka “martini.” Almost all customers prefer this shaken. It’s a good habit to ask the customer their preference.
When stirring
Drinks should be stirred for at least 30 seconds to achieve proper dilution and chilling.

**It Starts Before The Wedding**
The job starts well before the wedding. You're job here is basically to take as much load/stress of the groom's shoulders while he just worries about his core aspects of planning the wedding and his daily life. Offer to run errands for him, reservations/arrangements, scheduling, advice, and general venting. Don't let him stress out.

**Bachelor Party**
Find out as soon as you can if he even wants to have a bachelor party, as he may not want surprises, clear this kind of entertainment ahead of time). Is there anyone he *doesn't* want to be there? Activities? It's important to know that the groom should *not* pay for anything associated with the bachelor party. Try to estimate what his costs will be, and divide this burden equally among the attendees. Make sure take care of all of the invites, bookings, communications, etc. It should be a fun, make sure not to schedule it the night before the wedding

**Tuxedos**
Unless the parents of the groom or bride are handling it, ringbearers, etc).  Schedule the fitting, make sure everyone has all of the accessories and whatnot. Make sure to pick them up and get them to the appropriate people. **Important:** You also need to make sure that all of the items are returned and not lost. This happens a lot, as guys lose jackets, etc all the time. If you see someone take their jacket off later in the night, grab and it stow it somewhere for safekeeping (let them know as well). Before leaving the reception

**Transportation** 
If necessary

**Contact List**
Keep a list of contacts for all vendors and important attendees at the wedding (parents, caterers, wedding parties, planner, drivers, etc). Also put together a backup list of certain vendors should someone fall through. Save it on your phone and print a copy for your pocket. 

**Expenses**
Although it isn't your responsibility to cover wedding expenses

**Rehearsal/Preparations**
Do some research on what's expected of you and the groomsmen during the rehearsal dinner, but you don't want to look lost, and will be able to hand out last minute instruction if someone forgets what to do.

**The Rock**
You need to be the grooms rock. Whatever he needs leading up to, keep his head together. It's all about him and his bride to be.

**The Toast**
This is where I see the most issues and mistakes. Make sure you plan ahead and rehearse (keep a note card handy if you like). The most important thing to remember is that *this is not about you.* **IT IS ABOUT THE BRIDE** Do not try to steal the show. I see so many guys try get a standing ovation, but that can come after the toasts. Have the DJ or emcee help you get everyone's attention. Stick to the heart. No embarrassing stories or cliches. Thank everyone involved (first, whoever paid for the wedding), compliment the bride, and make a quick sentimental note about the groom. Congratulate them and wish them luck, and raise your glass. Be nice, be brief

**Post-Wedding Prep**
Make sure that the groomsmen get checked out of the hotel on time (if applicable), but make sure nothing is used that will mess up the paint. If there's no driver, you need to stay sober and be prepared to take them to the hotel or airport. Make sure you have all of the tuxes/accessories and that they are returned on time. Then, go get some sleep.

A few more quick tips:

**Dont Lose The Ring**
Goes without saying

**Be On Time**
Make sure you and the groomsmen are prepared and on time for every step.

**Be Prepared**
Phone charged, make sure everyone is accounted for.

**Be Confident**
If you're prepared and collected, discuss it with the groom and recommend someone else. 

**Be Yourself**
This is what got you the job. If the groom didn't trust you or think you were up to it, and that the groom just has to worry about showing up.  Have fun!",,False,self,t5_2u82c,1369747151.0,,

1360636356.0,18cnr2,More information on handshakes,wsreddit,47,11,4,"I read the short info graphic that was posted today about wrong hand shaking styles and although interesting i found it to be mostly common sense and thought i'd make this post. i searched this subreddit for more information about handshakes and didn't find much. so heres just some of my understandings on handshaking.

To start out, and submission.  A good example of this is when pledging allegiance the open palm is set over the heart, or when taking [an oath](http://imgur.com/8KWo79c), it is held over an important document or text (ex: the bible).  Understanding this is important in learning how to use handshakes to your advantage.


An open palm is submissive, if you've never tried it, you'd be amazed at how charming women find this).  I'll usually add a charming line as well like, ""Guurl that booty is driving me crazy"".

The opposite hand shake position is the palm facing down position.  This hand position can be seen as aggressive and/or un truthful.  An example of this is, but lets use [Hitler as an example.](http://imgur.com/wO5f5Cd)  So palm down postion handshakes can be seen as aggressive and dominating.  As a personal rule i don't usually use this kind of handshake unless: 
*I'm fucking with someone.
*They're fucking with me.
These kinds of things tend to happen at the bar when i've had too much whiskey. 

So it's safe to suppose that a level/vertical open hand is the safest option for meeting someone new or in a work place.  My personal rule for these handshakes is: if I see a person as an equal then i give them [this handshake.](http://imgur.com/DwUWfF7)  For this reason it is my most frequently used handshake.

So keeping in mind all this information, or i can turn it all the way so their palm is up and mine is down.  The latter of these options I only used when i have a pure unadulterated disdain for the other person, and i want them to know, that i am alpha and they are beta.  Sometimes using this power play can be tricky and it is recommended that if you want to use a move like this (remember with great responsibility yadda yadda) then practice with a friend.  Sometimes it's tricky heaving the other persons hand over, so you can practice stepping in with one foot to assist with this.  If my right hand is out, my left foot is forward, the other party gives me a dominant palm down, then step in with my right foot and finish turning the hand over.


That is basically all i know about handshakes. So go out there and try them out.  Submit to people.  Fuck with people.  Have fun. My ""personal rules"" i mentioned in this post are empirical, with friends, and especially at bars and parties.  

I'd also like to mention that i am admittedly a noob, and also [I'm new](http://youtu.be/Svg3IIRbBZ0).  I'm happy to take any constructive criticism, and if you read this whole article, I thank you and it's been fun.

Second: The cavity can be LIGHTLY stuffed with all manner of aromatics that, bunches of thyme, rosemary, or sage are popular. Be careful not to overstuff. These items are just there very lightly flavor the air. Too much and they don't cook, no air escapes, and little flavoring happens.

Third: The bird is best cooked as hot as humanly possible. For some people with good ventilation in their kitchen, then dropping to 400 before the fat starts to smoke too much. My smoke alarms go off at the drop of a hat, so I usually start at 425 for 15 minutes, then drop to 400 with the convection fan on to mimic the cooking environment of a hotter oven.

Fourth: Until you know your oven and have a feel for timings based on bird size, tilt the pan so the juices run out of the cavity. They should be clear, not red. 

Fifth: Rest your bird for at least 15 minutes, given its relative density, it will continue doing for quite some time after removing from the oven. 

Sixth: Carve properly: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msscPphcLyo

Optional Extra step: STOCK! (note: stock != soup. Stock != broth. Stock is used later to make broth which is used to make soup).

Either a.) Chop up the carcass with a butcher knife, and throw in a gallon freezer bag. Do this every time you roast a chicken. When the freezer bag is full, make a shit ton of stock and freeze.

1376440783.0,1kbf12,EMSK How to Enjoy Drinking Whiskey.,theholidayhawk,35,8,9,"I originally wrote this for /r/malelifestyle

Most people believe that whiskey and other distilled spirits serve only one purpose. That purpose is to get a person drunk as quickly as possible. While this certainly is a viable use for whiskey it is not the only one. For many, even when not drinking enough to get drunk. This idea is obviously foreign to many. The reason for this is that most people simply have not been drinking quality whiskeys; rather they choose their whiskeys for quantity. 

The purpose of this guide is not to try and get you to stop drinking whiskey as you most enjoy it, and it is yours alone. In my opinion making your own decisions is what part of being a man and living the male lyfestyle is. If you only want to drink whiskey to get drunk, and not for the other qualities of the whiskey, stop reading here.

The first barrier that is in the way of a person enjoying whiskey is the harshness of the beverage. Some you will find to be very harsh, is to use water to reduce the alcohol content. This can help to release the aromas and flavors as well as cut the burn from the alcohol. Second, ice can be used; this both reduces the alcohol content and cools the whiskey. Both the reduction in percentage and the cooler temperature will help cut the burn, however the cooling will also act to reduce the flavor of the whiskey. Third, and possibly the best, is to use a whiskey nosing glass such as a glencairn or copita. These have a “tulip” shape and help to concentrate the aromas of the whiskey making it easier to smell, which is also a very important aspect tasting anything. Snifters can also be used for nosing whiskey

Sometimes the harshness can come from the flavor profile of the whiskey. Not much can be done about this other than ice and cooling the whiskey. However

Once you have dealt with the harshness of a whiskey you will finally be able to taste and nose the whiskey. Nosing should come first. It can help ease the drinker into the whiskey and can give a good idea of what to expect from tasting it. Smell is also an important aspect of taste

The technique for nosing is fairly simple. Swirling the whiskey in the glass will help increase surface area of the whiskey and release more of the particles that create the aroma. Then

When tasting it is often best to start with a relatively small amount of whiskey and move it around your mouth

I will also include a short list of some of the most highly suggested beginner whiskey brands for those people who have never heard of any other than Jack Daniels, but they are the ones that most beginners tend to enjoy and they aren’t very expensive. There are many types of whiskey out there, all of which have their own unique flavors. The only way to find out what you like is to try them.

Bourbons: Makers Mark, Four Roses, Evan Williams (Comes in Black Label and Single Barrel), Old Grand-Dad (Comes in 80 proof, 100 proof, and 114 proof), Bulleit.

First, and you can leave any offer on the table.

Second, my car was insured for the ACV, which is almost always lower (sometimes much lower) than the RC.

RC negotiations are simple, etc.  Know why those differences might be important.  You might have a 2007 model of a car, and the insurance company pulled comparables for the 2008 model, which seems fair.  But make sure that the 2008 model is the same!  That year may have a common problem with the suspension or engine that may lower the value.  Research that and report it to your insurance company.  Pull your own listings and make sure they jive.  If they don't, bring it up.

If your policy is for the ACV, and I know it's in much better shape than ""good.""  Furthermore, the adjuster that came to inspect my damage could have never evaluated the mechanical aspect of the car as my hood was jammed shut.  I discovered that they just *assumed* the car was in ""good"" shape based on the age (high) and mileage (low) of the car.  I demanded that we get the hood open and actually do an inspection.  Sure enough, most of my components were in ""very good"" shape.  That alone was an adjustment of over $230.  Also make sure that no features in your car was missed.  Do you have heated seats? Power mirrors?  Fancy headlights?  Make sure that all of those show up on the report.  Even basic things should be accounted for.  I nearly lost out on $80 because they didn't notice that my car has an alarm.

As a corollary to the above points, the adjuster was reluctant to say that it wasn't a pre-existing flaw.  However, by showing the representatives I worked with that I took care of problems as soon as they arose, I was able to convince them that that chip should not negatively impact the value of my car.  $50 gained.

Lastly, but if there is even a chance that you are right, the insurance company may cave.  I had to threaten arbitration before getting my vehicle re-evaluated, but it worked.  If you are right and you have the data to back you up, don't be afraid to do the same.  But also don't use it too early, as you also don't want to come off as a jerk.  Try to avoid saying things like ""I want $xxxx"" in favor of ""Well, my data shows that my car would be worth more like $xxxx.""

In all, and b) that I was *winning*, so I figured I'd share my experience here.

Heres what you need

as many steaks as you want

butter, preferably with the tears of virgin dutch milk maids, but storebought is fine too

olive oil, whatever as long as its virgin olive oil it will work

1 sprig of ether thyme or rosemary ( i prefer rosemary)

salt

pepper

one clove of garlic

and if you want to get real god damn fancy, a bottle of hefeweizen, and a tiny little pinch of allspice

You gonna need a big ol cast iron skillet for this one.

leave your steak on the counter

Heat the skillet over medium for about 5-10 min (10 for electric glass top

when the skillet is hot, once it melts crank the heat up to medium high.

salt and pepper the steak

once the butter starts to sizzle, flip that bastard and 
give it another 2 minutes

take your clove of garlic, channel your inner man and crush that bastard, throw it in the pan

add more butter, at this point add the rosemary or thyme (the entire sprig)

crank the heat to high, flip it, you should start to see some glorious brown crust form, once its as crusty as you want, remove from pan.

if you prefer your steak medium then throw the steak into the oven in a glass dish for minute or two on broil (bottom rack)

once the steak is resting, add a 

drop of oil and sautee those bastards till the onions are soft
third a can of the beer
spoon god dammit) till it reduces to a thick sauce

Additionally

**Additional Items**

Don't use too much, try things out and see what works for you.  Although more expensive products tend to work better, there are plenty of cheaper products that are great.  Not all products work the same (i.e. one wax may yield a different result than another), so it's worth it to try various brands and varieties.",,False,self,False,t3_1jix9s

1369764845.0,1f7ofy,EMSN How to properly inspire discipline in kids and deal with problem behaviors.,werdtheogrecl,18,6,4,"For my experience

First I""ll start by saying behavioral management is one of the hardest sciences to practice. Almost all undesirable behavior comes to us on the fly and most of the time requires immediate interventions in order to be effective. I will summarize effective quick interventions in the form of rules and concepts that in my experience as a behavioral specialist work very well.

1) Data on effective interventions state that immediate adversive consequences are 19% effective at modifying behavior

2) When a unpredictable behavior takes place use your tools to figure out the how and the why first. What did they get out of it? What did they avoid? What was the setting? Do not feed into the function of the behavior or you are showing them that their behavior is ok and they will continue to use it as a tool.

3) When a behavior occurs there are almost always witnesses

3) If you suspect its an issue with reteaching a better skill or your not 100% certain they did something use the time to teach them a new skill and tell them you expect they use the skill. If they are limit testing shut them down and make sure you follow through EVERY time they test you

4) When you are first expected to be responsible for said child, they will walk over you because you taught them to.

5) Many positive privileges are easier to manage than many adversive consequences. Also you get better buy in

6) Do not impose a consequence that you don't have the ability to enforce

7) Older kids hunt for reactions, and do it consistently. Failure to do so will always result in them using this as a tool to wear you down every time. Then you can't intervene because you are too spent to do so.

8) Make a big deal out of disrespect

9) DO NOT NEGOTIATE while a child is limit testing. Compromise is something left for times when the expectations are being followed. You show them that arguing and negotiating works when you give in. Say in a level tone ""This sounds like an argument

10) Never get physical or spank

11) Keep kids on  their toes and make your time together important and interesting. If they value time with you they don't want to undermine that time with misbehavior.

12) Teach kids high value skills

13) DO NOT ACKNOWLEDGE MISBEHAVIOR IN ANY POSITIVE WAY! It may be funny when jimmy makes fart noises but it wont be when he thinks its ok on his first date. What you feel is ok is different from what is best for your kids. Leave yourself and your own behaviors out of it. Ask yourself what is best and be fair firm and consistent you will both become better people.

14) If you have to impose a logical consequence make sure timewise it is as close to the behavior as possible. Don't want to go to bed? I'll remove the distractions from your room until you do. Quick effective

1. When you arrive at the party and you're a bit late and everyone's already buzzed or worse don't ever try to catch up. You'll only end up more fucked up than them and faster. Take it slow.

2. If you feel you're getting drunk already slow down

3. If you feel sick and need to vomit don't fight it, wash your face and rince your mouth. If you find mouthwash even better, you don't want your breath to smell like vomit and stomach acid is really bad for your teeth. After this you'll feel much better or even well enough to continue drinking.

4. Passing out/ falling asleep when parties die down is completely normal. Just don't be the first one unless you like having a huge penis drawn on your face and a whip cream beard. If you absolutely have to lie down make sure people notice you made a concious effort, whatever to make it look like you went out on your own terms. This would make people think you wanted to go to sleep and weren't just too hammered to say your own name.

5. Don't mix hard liquour with sweet drinks. Because of the sugar it gets absorbed way faster.

6. Stay hydrated. Hydrate enough and there's a big chance you might miss the pounding headache.
