1360081622.0,17xsrd,"10 Quick Tips for Budding HDSLR Wedding Videographers (1st Post: Be Gentle, lol)",rsandelius,68,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/videography/comments/17xsrd/10_quick_tips_for_budding_hdslr_wedding/, here's a couple tips that I've picked up over the last couple of years that have made my life much easier and might help you get started and/or become a little more efficient as you go along.

1. Get a monopod. The Manfrotto 561 model is awesome and you'll wonder how you ever shot without it. I sold my expensive shoulder rig after using this support and never looked back. It can double as an impromptu (not super effective

2. Ceremony coverage (for the most part) should go something like this: Set up your shot. Hit record. Take your hands off of the camera. Keep your hands off of the camera. Did I mentioned keep your hands off of the camera? Fidgeting with the camera every minute will cause a lot of headaches in the post production

3. Don't have the budget for the big-budget, which really isn't an issue since you'll most likely be MF'ing while you're shooting video anyways. 

4. Don't have the budget for a glidecam/slider/follow-focus/etc? Don't sweat it. Good coverage with a solid mix of wide shots

5. Trying to figure out what to do for your audio gear? Let me give you some suggestions: 
(a) Lavaliere microphone + recorder: Williams sound Mic090 + Zoom H1. I tried the AudioTechnica ATR3350 lav mic, economical, records high quality format(s) and supports the Williams mic, which uses phantom power and is sized perfectly for lav use.
(b) Tascam DR50. It's the new Zoom H4n: cheaper, which records an audio feed at a normal level + a second track at a set decrement, in case your audio peaks, which helps avoid clipping. Works great for tying into sound boards at ceremonies and receptions. 
(c) Tascam DR5. Perfect for satellite recording/placing on lecterns, but it's perfect for an auxilliary/ambient recorder. I usually have 2-3 of these stashed around the room. 

6. Get your exposure/color right in camera. HDSLR video has very little latitude when it comes to color correction, 1/120 for 60fps), but it's not iron: you can speed up or slow it down by 3-4 stops without getting too much noticeable motion weirdness. As for color, start with your presets and stay away from auto white balance. Auto works pretty well if you're in a static location, but if there's ANY mixed light coming in you're going to be in a world of hurt when your colors starts shifting mid-shot. It's a REAL pain to correct... and it's not worth it. 

7. If you're shooting outdoors, at ISO100 at 1/60sec, you're going to be struggling to get anything lower than F9-F11, which kills the ""cinematic look"" that HDSLR's are so good at. Getting a ND6 filter (B&amp;W, Tiffen, different strokes for different folks) are perfect for bringing your aperture back down to F4 or better. 

8. Avoid gimmicky gadgets. The accessory market for DSLR video is ridiculous. For example, etc, and the only time that you'll really appreciate that (for weddings) is when you're shooting details, like the ring/flowers, etc. Consider a rubber jar opener as an alternative. $3-4/ea and while they're certainly not perfect, it'll give you an easy &amp; cheap way to easy in and out of focus while you're perfecting your hand-held rack focussing, which is the ultimate end goal. 

9. A couple other gear selection considerations as well:
-Monopod &gt; Shoulder Rig (less fatigue
-Rode Videomic &gt; On-Camera Tascam DR40 w/ line-in to camera (in-camera audio is usually used as reference/in a pinch and the difference between what your camera gets and the DR40 gets is negligible. 
-Lowel Pro Light &gt; On-Camera Light (nobody likes a light in their face: it's not flattering, so you have to get really close to them.

10. Use off-camera lights. Same reasons as listed above. Turn them on

So yeah... just a couple of quick tips to help you get started and to not freak out when you're getting started. 

Like I said in the title, then I'm totally happy.

I am not limited to this music I have posted here and I am fairly confident I can create what you might be looking for, dissonant, anything. Some things may be more challenging than others, but that's why I'm here and doing this in the first place.

I am also not opposed to any of the music I have posted here being used in your project if you find something you like.

",5,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/videography/comments/12lhrl/ive_figured_out_the_fastest_way_to_make_dvd_for/,"I do a lot of filming where I would be filming a live event with a 3 camera setup and production switcher. The event would get recorded into a computer for an HD master, but I'd also be recording it to DVD to deliver within minutes. To get that DVD burned, I was using a Pioneer PRV-LX1,' I mean the quality was good because ours had the SDI input module

Unfortunately, because Pioneer discontinued the unit in 2007, and ceased parts and service in 2010. I then looked at replacement DVD recorders, but I couldn't find one that was really professional quality. All the ones I found had only analog inputs, usually S-Video. Even a Firewire (DV) port wasn't satisfactory, because the 4:1:1 colorspace of MiniDV translates very poorly to DVD's 4:2:0. JVC was the only company that still makes a DVD recorder with a proper input (SDI,) and that unit costs $3500.

So I figured out a better way, authors the DVD, then burns it, all in realtime. There's about 1-3 minutes in between hitting 'stop' on the recorder and having a completed DVD in your hand. 

[Here's the basic version](http://pastebin.com/egW6bK0b). It's done mostly with ffmpeg. It was originally written on Linux with an HDV camera, so it won't run anywhere else with out some editing right now. I'm working on fixing that, and also a port to Python so I can make a GUI for it.

After I got the script working, with the price and quality complaints I mentioned. I know a couple churches that have also had Pioneer DVD recorders that died, and they replaced them with crappier units. They'd love to have some of the features that this setup adds.

I also have some 'beta' versions that do a whole bunch more tricks, and include them on each disk. I think Blu-Ray authoring is feasible too. 

Any thoughts? I was pretty excited about pulling this off because the consultants said it was impossible.",self,t5_2qwgz,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/videography/comments/12lhrl/ive_figured_out_the_fastest_way_to_make_dvd_for/

The computer I set up for him is currently running Linux Mint. I have heard that there are great Non-linear Editing programs on Linux. I can change his OS if there is a better one for editing but I would like to keep him on Linux. I do have Windows boxes too. His school uses Final Cut on Mac.

I don't really know ANYTHING about cameras and hardware considerations/OS considerations. I am a programmer and my hardware experience is aout 10 years outdated so maybe I am worrying about compatibility when I don't have to be?

If this isn't the right place for this can you please point me to where I should ask? Thanks!

TL;DR Need a starter camera for a 16 year old film student. Any recommendations?

EDIT: Thanks for all of your input. I think we are going to wait and buy a better camera we can add on to at x-mas.

With most projects, editors may charge anywhere from 200-1000 dollars per hour based on experience. My rate as an editor is 40 per hour. As a rule of thumb, a client is billed for one hour of editing for each minute of the final product.

Traditionally I shoot on dslr for clients. I KNOW I am about to get a huge barrage of anti-dslr comments for this type of event because of the record limit. The only reason I am even considering using 4 t2i's despite their foolish record limit is because of their low light performance.

I am looking to rent FOUR setups for the four different conference rooms. I already have a t3i with several good prime lenses (rokinon 1.4's) and a bunch of support/audio equipment. What I'm guessing is that I need to rent three solid tripods (i have my own already), 3 dslrs (with lenses) or 4 camcorders. For audio I was thinking of just using 4 zoom h1's with lav mics on the speakers. I could also slap a rode videomic on each of the cameras as backup.

I've looked it up, but the 600D is a crop sensor (x1.6) DSLR, and I feel it would be too ""zoomed in"" for me.

So

I bought a Canon 7D in 2010 and just recently sold it

I was initially going to get a video camera

So I looked back at dslrs. My dream was a full frame cam, I couldnt find any full frames with 1080p60p or 60i. I then started to look at the GH3. It has all the features I want except no full frame. 

At this point in time I am leaning towards getting a panasonic gh3 for these reasons. I realize I'm not a professional videographer(...yet) so why invest in a super expensive camera right now if im still honing my skills and edits. The dslr may not be a true video camera but I love the versatility of having dof

With that said

I film mostly action sports and am looking to get into the more documentary lifestyle side of sports and actually telling a story through a video. Here are some links to some of my recent work. Any advice is greatly appreciated!

We filmed and edited a video for a client we met on Model Mayhem
So we had two short days of shooting on location and edited a short motivational video to his specifications (he knew exactly what he wanted for the overall feel of the video and we filled in the rest)

All the time we spoke about the video he had a song in mind for the background, we sent him a couple of drafts and tweaked a few things for him and considered him re-recording his monologue and sending that to us as we weren't 100% happy with the audio. We didn't hear from him for another week so kept working on it and sent him our final version yesterday, we were pretty happy with it.

This morning he replied and told us he had already uploaded and released the video on his own youtube. He had re-recorded his monologue and used the non copyright free song instead of the song we'd edited the video to and uploaded it to youtube

If the question of copyright comes into play here

A non-profit church that I help out purchased a [Canon GL 2](http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/products/camcorders/professional_camcorders/gl2) for filming videos for the church community.

Their goal is to simply create ""how to"" videos for the church ministries

The problem is that I'm the only one with any experience regarding film that helps out with the committee.  

Compounded on that is the GL2 is a miniDV format

So - should we ""upgrade"" to a newer camera that has a more friendly interface (particularly regarding the analog-to-digital formatting)?  Or do we just need to spend money on a computer that can handle the GL2 and suck it up?

Is the GL2 really that good of a camera as it seems?  It's still retailing for close to $2800.  But with lack of experience (and not many good tutorials)

I do mostly interview and roaming on the shoulder event stuff, not long form live events. So i don't have the equipment, or really know what to use.
The pay is low enough (~$350/per) that if I rented anything out

I'd rather not go through the trouble of finding three people and handing them off for the gig if it means I don't work it myself, selfish I know, but oh well)

I offered a solution of running four DSLR cameras with onboard sound for reference. I would shoot two on the wings and two in the center. than, upload to FCPx which he uses, and sync multicam to the audio and voila -he has two hours of usable footage. 

Is this a reasonable solution to the problem? Yes the cameras would miss pieces of the performance

Any thoughts or solutions on how I can work this show? Or do I need to just find someone else to rec and forget about working it myself. Or can I tell him I'm not the guy for the job and leave it that?

I am the director of a junior bowling tournament that will be live streaming our events that run monthly.  

I have a friend that streams tournaments that has agreed to let me use their setup, I have been looking into investing in my own live streaming setup.

It's tough

The setup that my friend has contains a souped up computer with a lot of black magic cards and 4 Sony Handycam HDR-CX210s, so they have headsets, soundboard, headphone amp, etc, but I have that area covered.

I basically have to start from scratch. I have a decent knowledge of working around a computer

All the items in the list below come from the research that I've done over the last few weeks

Here's the list that I've come up with from the internet connection to the cameras.

Modem: Linksys WRK54G

Ethernet Cable: I have a 25 foot one

Computer: I figure I'll need to get a desktop for this project. I'm sure I'll have to add an HDMI in card. I was looking at this computer, just right, etc. The price ($870) is fairly on the expensive side for what I'm budgeting. If anyone has any suggestions, I am open to them. I have a decent monitor, a mouse, and a keyboard, so I only really need the PC. In order to stream the HDMI signal, but I cannot afford $1000 for one. If anyone could offer a suggestion.  I saw that there is a black magic intensity pro card that's $200

HDMI Cables - I know I'll need a lot of these. For the final matches, so I'll most likely get cables and couplers so that an adapter isn't weighting the mini-HDMI plug in from the camera.

Cameras - These are the kind that they use: www.amazon.com/Sony-HDR-CX210-Definition-Handycam-Camcorder/dp/B006K550PY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1363288201&amp;sr=8-1  If anyone has any suggestions as to similar cameras there aren't as costly that offer the same functionality (or a website with some deals) that would be great. I'm trying to keep it around $350 for 3 cameras to start.

HDMI Switcher - I figure that this would suit my needs for switching between the cameras. I can use the remote to switch between the cameras.  All the audio will come from the commentary and an ambient microphone, thus expanding my HDMI capabilities to six cameras if I should ever expand to that many cameras. http://www.amazon.com/Monoprice-Enhanced-Switch-Equalizer-REV-3-0/dp/B002J10W74/ref=sr_1_1s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1363246168&amp;sr=1-1

* I've been making corporate 'DIY how-to' videos for a couple of years but have always worked with Z1/EX1/XF300 type equipment. I used to set everything to full-auto and point and forget about it.

* However I wanted to move into world of DLSR videography and actually be able to make visually engaging videos too.

* So I got a 5D3 two weeks ago and have been teaching myself the basics from scratch.

**Edit 1:** thanks for the replies. 1000 is the limit on our p-cards but if I'm not going to get everything i want of 1000 i can fill out all the paper work and get the department office to order it.

So we have both a Panasonic Lumix Dmc-FZ18 and a Canon vixia HV30. The vixia still shoots to mini dv cassettes and uses a firewire cable to transfer the raw video to one of our Macs. This is the one i was looking to replace / upgrade. I would normally just buy a new mother board with a firewire port on it for 200 but firewire is being phased out in even apple the new apple hardware.

I guess i should have ask does it make more sense to get a DSLR or an HD camcorder?

Sorry i'm kind of a camera / camcorder novice

I've nixed the camcorder idea, it has a pretty good HD video capability that will meet my needs for my pseudo-documentary. 

So, a [Flashpoint Cool Light 4](http://www.adorama.com/FPCL4K.html) for lighting, and this [Shure SM58 combo pack](http://amzn.com/B00105V5MQ).

I am planning on doing mainly fixed shots indoors, I can set up the mic not far out of the shot, and if I have more than one person speaking near each other, I would need two shotgun mics to get both people, as opposed to one cardioid to record both. Lastly, I am thinking that just one set of lights may not be such a hot idea if I want to get balanced lighting, especially as the Cool Lights are daylight-balanced fluorescent and will not even come close to color balancing with household tungsten or CFL. Would I be better off getting multiple less powerful cool lights (such as two of [these](http://www.adorama.com/FPCL1A.html)) if I am going to get portable lighting?

EDIT: I'm now thinking that a cardioid mic is actually not right for most of the sort of filming I want to do, which I can point at the subjects from just off-camera, or next to the camera for closer shots. Also, I think I'll be mainly using available light for a more natural effect.

EDIT #2: I think some people are misunderstanding my goals and methods here. I'm not making a film for public release, with occasional help from friends with transport and setting up gear. 

EDIT #3: Now considering [this LED light](http://amzn.com/B002SWKK4E), and the ability to adjust the color temperature. I am worried though that the price to light output is very poor. If I'm going to use portable artificial light, it needs to be both easy to transport and capable of being balanced with tungsten light while still giving good light output. Also, I'm looking for recommendations for a microphone with a cone-shaped receiving pattern.",,False,self,1339433115.0,t3_uuz0m

so

My idea of the set-up for this is:

* streaming with XSplit software

- using 2 HDMI/component cameras - 1080p (full HD)

- commentators PC connected with HDMI to BlackMagic Intensity Pro capture card

- using 2 Wi-Fi connected cameras - 720p

- sound from commentators going to audio mixer connected with USB to streaming PC

The problem is I'm not sure how should I connect that two HDMI or component cameras to my PC

As I'm not sure will it work to stack 3 PCI-E BlackMagic Intensity capture cards into PC, 3rd card as component for full HD camera video. 

As I saw that BlackMagic has one control panel for selecting one source at a time!

Will XSplit or any other live streaming software realize that I have 3 different sources (physical capture cards) and not only one (because of the same brand

I often find myself doing short arc

When I want to be super mobile I just use a 5DM3

However they are never as steady as I want them and often have to resort to Premiere's Warp Stabilizer to get what I want. As in the above example.

I was thinking of using a monopod and a ball head to give me the shots that I want but with that fourth point of contact for much increased stability. 

My questions are:
Is there anything wrong with this idea? My Google Fu seems weak on this one - perhaps I'm using the wrong terminology.
Have I chosen the right kit?

I was thinking of [this monopod](http://www.manfrotto.co.uk/fluid-video-monopod-with-head-560B-1) paired with [this head](http://www.calumetphoto.co.uk/eng/product/giottos_ball_head_series_ii_with_quick_release_10kg_/755-001b). 

Already have a [Manfrotto 701 head](http://www.manfrotto.co.uk/pro-fluid-video-mini-head) in my kit for tripod duty. I suppose I could use that head with the monopod but its only two degrees of movement. I imagine I would need a ball head for three degrees of movement?

Any and all advice appreciated.

I decided that the DSLR world really appeals to me for a number of reasons. Form factor, ability to also take stills (photography is a hobby I'd like to explore.)

I've honestly spent hours upon hours researching everything from Sony, Nikon etc. For some time I was settling on the 60D or GH2/3 but I really want that full-frame sensor.

From the beginning

I waited patiently since August I held out to see what the new FF offerings from Sony

The A99 (which I was really holding my breath for) video functionality seems underwhelming from what I've read

So I think I've settled on the 5D MKIII. I have a budget of $5000 for the body, a shotgun mic and a stabilization system.

Do you think the 5D would hold me over for the next few years or it somewhat close to be being old news?

I know some of you will recommend I just go for a large chip video camera to begin with the closest one to my budget would be the FS100 which would be about the equivalent of $8000 without any lenses or accessories (I'm in South Africa

But really what I'm basing my decision on is the look of the 5D. Pixel peeping and line-skipping aside

I'm planning on making the purchase before the end of the year. Are there any thoughts? Am I making the right decision or blowing a whole lot of $$$?
 
For those who own the camera

Excuse the vent

**TL;DR - 5D MKIII for 90/10% videography/stills - yay or nay?**

Edit 1: I generally shoot full manual all the time

Edit 2: This probably deserves its own thread

I have a lightweight Velbon CX686 tripod and a ProAim 2' slider. I've never been able to get decent slider shots because when the slider's on the tripod and the camera's on that

I've been using the former method (for corporate and event projects) where videography and editing are about $40 per hour each with original music production at $70.  

My competitors use the second method where they'll charge about $300 per minute that the final edit is which I gather covers everything that went into putting together that minute. Their videos are generally 2 to 4 minutes though.

I truly love the wedding side to our company...to be a part of someone's happiest moments of their lives is such a blessing.

I've always liked recording events and such and then editing the videos after.

I've only used Windows Movie Maker

I think I've got a pretty good grasp on making decent videos but I know there's a lot that I do now know and a couple of classes would do me good.

I'm thinking about recording weddings and events for the career part.  My wife is an aspiring photographer and likes doing family and wedding photos

So finally to my questions:

1. What kinds/types of classes are there that I can take? Should I take them at a university or like an arts college?

2. I've been meaning to buy a new camcorder because mine IS IN NO WAY good enough for professional services.  So should I buy an HD prosumer camcorder and upgrade later or go ahead and by a professional one?

3. What types of accessories are there for what I want to do or some that I should look into?

4. Since I want to learn Adobe Premiere would it be best to get a book

5. Are there any websites or good forums

6. If you don't like Adobe Premiere what other video editing software is out there that you would recommend?

As far as the classes go I live in the DFW area of Texas and would like to stay around here if you of anything around here.

Then he had the idea of me doing a wedding video, and that he would understand if it didn't work out. So I said, why the hell not, the kid is only 18, so I don't think the marriage will last forever, so we will have another go later on in life. (I married young and it didn't work out, so I like to poke fun at him about getting married young..)

Anyways, and even some how-tos from stillmotion and some other sites. the thing is I'm doing this solo and don't have access to a lot of gear, and I'm not getting paid enough to invest in any extra gear, but I do have access to some canon lenses that I can ""borrow"" from work.

what I do have:
canon 5d mark 2 with 24-105L
a decent tripod with a decent fluid head
a cheap monopod that I could put the fluid head on
a roland voice recorder
a gorillapod mini-tripod that had that ball head.
a crappy shoulder/chest mount that is in the mail and I haven't used yet

from work I can use
canon 50 1.4
canon 70-200 f4 IS (maybe the 2.8 non-IS)
canon 40 2.8 stm
canon 100 macro 2.8 non-L

basically I work at a retailer, gopro hero 3 black, and maybe another DSLR, but I would have to pay out of pocket until I return it.


My plan, while having the recorder sitting upfront taking in them talking. I would prefer and over the shoulder shots, but they I would either only get the bride OR groom, unless I ran back and forth which may be a little obtrusive.

Then at reception

maybe I'll get the macro with the fluid head on the monopod to do faux sliding shots of the decor, little things for more b-roll footage.

I only want to make like a 5-10 minute thing


one thing I worry about with getting different lenses is switching them out

Heres what ive tried:
change settings on dr-05 to mp3 -&gt; record something random -&gt; add into premiere -&gt; export to vimeo... it works on mobile
convert original wav to mp3 and add into premiere... doesnt work on mobile
play audio through soundcard -&gt; headphone jack connected to cable connected to mic jack on dr05 (set to mp3) -&gt; import into premiere -&gt; export to vimeo... doesnt work on mobile
convert original wav to mp3 -&gt; burn onto audio cd -&gt; import audio track through itunes -&gt; bring into premiere -&gt; export to vimeo... doesnt work on mobile

ive tried different render settings for the audio

The only thing that works (using that term loosely) is playing the wav file through speakers and recording a new mp3 file with the dr-05's microphone next to the speaker.

whoever is the first person to post a link to vimeo where the audio works on a smartphone

My question is - how does fcp x handle imported 60p footage? Does it skip frames to make it fit the 24 p timeline - and then how does it slow it down to 40% - does it re-import the dropped frames?

Obviously content is key, this will mean shotgun mics or lav mics. Lastly good editing/post-production to tie it all together.

The base plan is to rent a car and the equipment for a weekend and get all my shooting done in that period of time. I'll be borrowing a friend for the tripod shots while the car is in motion.

A little background: I've shot stills with a DSLR for few years and with all honesty I can say that I can get pretty decent shots with my camera. I've had a camcorder for years


I just got a Sony NEX-6 as a travel/second body/video camera and I've really fell in love with the video capabilites.


My parents took tons of footage of me and my brothers when we were growing up and now the videos are priceless. I want to do the same for my kids. So I won't be making any commercial stuff or anything.

iMovie is almost good enough for me. It does what it does and it's free so I can't really complain. What I find that it's lacking is color correction abilities that I'm used to get with processing raw footage from my DSLR stills.

So could FCP X be a good choice to upgrade? My projects would be small. I just want to take footage of my family and then make it look ""professional"". Should I stick with iMovie and try to get everything correct in camera or just pay the 300€ (which is not that bad considering how much I have invested in my photography gear). I think something like Premiere 6 is out of my price league and too fancy for my needs (as far as I've understood).


Any advice is appreciated.",self,t5_2qwgz,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/videography/comments/18njxi/fcp_x_a_reasonable_upgrade_coming_from_imovie/

It is now mid-February. There has been several releases &amp; updates since

(If you've never used the version 3 of the PluralEyes software and shoot using second-system sound (digital recorders that you re-sync back over the less-than-stellar on-camera audio during editing) you really need to go out and download a demo... it's amazing!)

Red Giant: It's now been almost 5 months since I paid for my PluralEyes software license (version 3) and I have yet to be able to use it

Every day that Red Giant delays the deployment of Version 3 of PluralEyes for Windows is another day that customers/purchasers of the license are essentially pissing away their investment. 

I'd love to get the attention of someone at Red Giant who can actually DO something about this issue. I'm a pretty laid back guy and I understand that sometimes there are delays/setbacks in R&amp;D

Please share/spread the word if you are frustrated with Red Giant's actions/inactions as well. Thank you.

Plus a lot of us only have enough for the new camera and then don't have any money for good lenses. What he plans on doing is instead of spending money on a new camera he will invest in really nice lenses. Then the next time he needs to shoot something he will just rent the camer he needs.
I figure that if he spend $3000 every year on a new lens (instead of a new camera) he will have an amazing collection of lenses in 5 years that won't be obsolete and work with what ever camera he wants to rent.

I'm actually an Executive Chef by trade and run well respected restaurant. For about the past year, for free. I have an audio podcast and I've currently released 123 instructional videos that are all available in 720p format, for free, on YouTube and my website. 

Recently I've had a few different educational and consulting companies within the culinary field contact me, which means I would receive no add revenue. The problem is, I have no idea what to charge. 

Now while I'm a complete amateur, shoot, edit, photograph, voice over and encode your video in the desired format. In most cases you would have to pay a chef to demonstrate (and if he/she were any good, that alone would cost around $50/hr), hire a separate camera man/video editor and then rent a kitchen that you could shoot in.

Also

To give a frame of reference, [my three part food science video on emulsification](http://stellaculinary.com/podcasts/video/what-is-an-emulsion-a-cooks-guide#what-is-an-emulsion) took me about 80 hours from start to finish, including research, layout (I used Keynote with screen recording) and voice over. 

The current company that I'm talking to wants me to shoot 20-25 ""simple technique videos, it sounds like the ""average"" video would take me about 5 hours from start to finish.

So, by the finished video minute, or give them a package deal on all 25 videos?

We don't need a switcher or anything fancy. We've got a couple of Macbook pros (one is retina with HDMI port). I have a Canon 6D and 7D but I'm willing to find/rent/buy an HD webcam or something that will work. We just want a decent picture and audio.

1) should we use ustream or is there a better program (cheaper?)
2) dslr probably isn't ideal especially since the livestream will be about an hour or so long
3) how can I get decent audio? doesn't have to be perfect.

1375485966.0,1jlhdv,Questions about using my Nikon D5100 for Video,Gardidien,4,0,6,"Hello everyone

My friends and I film short videos for fun. We started off with a crappy handycam and we're now using my D5100 with the kit lens to shoot. I have a few questions regarding this. 

1. Since the camera is obviously built for pictures. Am I damaging the camera / lens in any way by recording hours of video? I didn't know if maybe the sensor wasn't built to handle the constant exposure it receives from shooting video for a few hours a day. 

2. Will my battery degrade by shooting video? I noticed that I can't as many shots off when taking pictures before it goes dead. It's not that old either. 

3. When filming, I can be at 100 ISO for video and the shots are super clear. I'd love to be able to have my indoor shots be that clear as well. 

Thank you everyone who can answer my questions and and help me out. I hope this is in the right place. I've learned a lot about photography from you guys so I'm hoping there's some knowledgeable people out there who know some things about using your DSLR for video as well. 

For anyone interested
