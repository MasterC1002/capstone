1359876079.0,17sqwy,Teacher uses a shared interest in video games to connect with a troubled kid. (X-post from r/gaming),InstructMeHow2Dougie,43,2,5,"There was a kid in my class last semester, if any. He's socially awkward

In my efforts to make a connection with Matt I found out that he has a great enthusiasm for video games. Normally he'd seem glum, but was also conversant on the subject. He would come in before class and bend my ear about a new area he'd explored in Skyrim, the lore of Halo, the relative merit of ACOG vs Red-dot, and suchlike.

About three weeks before the end of the semester he told me that the power adapter on his Xbox had broken (the big grey brick thing, I wanted to see him happy, but I was also wary about what message I'd be giving him by simply passing it on with no questions asked. So, I told him I'd at least need a note from his parents that said it was OK for him to have it. Matt was doing alright in my class, but it's a relatively untaxing elective, so I checked around with his other teachers and found out he was in danger of failing a couple of his classes and possibly repeating the year. So, when Matt brought the note in the next day I made him a deal that I'd give him the adapter and an extra controller (he'd mentioned that his dad had wanted to try playing with him but he only had one controller) if he passed all of his exams and all of his courses for the semester. We shook awkwardly on it and he went on his way. He reminded me each day about our deal, and he did try to negotiate some details of it

On the day after exams I found out, so I put the stuff in a box with a little note encouraging him to take my class next year, balance schoolwork and gaming, etc. This I took to be just a small victory, but I was humbled by his response. There were three other boys in my room making up late work when Matt came in with his mom to find out how he'd done. When I gave him the box he said ""thanks!"" and spontaneously gave me a big hug. This in front of his peers who were no doubt liable to mock him for it later. His mom, who was at least 20 years my senior said, ""Thank you sir, son."" True story. Oh man

Dodgeball, skinned elbows and usually bruised feelings.   Kids can’t get enough of it.  They love the socially accepted opportunity to dish some out on their peers, but they usually forget that it will come back around.  Just as everything is going swimmingly, that ball out of nowhere whizzes in and flattens against your face.  Like a rubberband snapped across your eye, a cupped hand boxing your ear.  Pure senseless pain; that’s the price of playing the game.  It was my choice of how to deal with this daily suffering.

I would see a kid get punked right in the face and I would rush over to them.  “Oh my god, and you didn’t deserve that, you poor thing”.  You are a victim and this sucks.  Every time I reacted in alarm they would cry.  Sometimes they would cry the rest of the day.  One time a kid cried till he went home, it was nearly seven hours later.  Clearly his nose didn’t hurt seven hours after being clocked, but it was just the principle of how unfair it was.  

Through experience I learned my reactions to the kids’ pain would set the standard for how they looked at it, I would tell them, “You’re tough, keep going”.  When I they got jacked in the face I would give a look of surprise and awe.  “Damn, you just got rocked.  I love this game too”.  I wouldn’t tell them to dwell on how cruel this circumstance was, I would tell them you can handle this, move on.  After adopting this policy, coagulating between the toes in their Spiderman sandals.  Concussed kids would still be in the game

Sammy’s mother died last night.  My boss told me before the kids showed up.  Poor Sammy was already hyper-temperamental, but instead he got some hard shit in his early life.  He showed up that day a little late as my boss told l the assembled camp the daily announcements.  Sammy walked right up and sat in my lap.  Normally I wouldn’t let something like that fly, but I already didn’t know what to say.  After sitting quietly for a bit Sammy turned to me, said, “My mom died,” and then turned away.  “I know, buddy” I whispered back reflexively, kid.  Something really bad picked you out and it’s not your fault.  If I could eat some of your pain for you I would but for now you are stuck with it.  These other kids that have much happier lives deserve them no more than you.  But don’t cry Sammy because if you start to cry now you may keep on crying for a very long time, I told him

I play in a recreational ball hockey league. This is basically floor hockey with refs and rules. The season is now over

We won the D Division. That in itself is not impressive. We were playing in a 6 team combined C/D division. Top two teams were moved up to the B division, and they were awesome to play against. Lots of energy, they could run, and they were clean and competitive. We won the first game and lost the second. Automatically goes to overtime, which we won.

But no one should care about that stuff

Michael is 18 years old, and his abilities are not top level. Instead Michael was just a source of energy and enthusiasm. Oh did I mention that Michael is autistic, that is also important.

The first game of the year, but we wanted to win and we did not want anyone to get hurt. I have never known anyone with autism so I really did not know what to expect and was worried. Turns out we were ignorant and Michael would show us that he was every bit (maybe more) as capable of playing as the rest of us.

As the season progressed we realized that he tries as hard (or harder) than anyone and is extremely excited to be on the team. He out ran many others, he calmed down and the other teams player who got him riled up apologised, (he did not know Michael is special) gave him a hug and they were good friends the rest of the game. Imagine a hug in a ball hockey game between teams of men. That night was special. After that happened Michael got high fives from the other teams players (between shifts) and was encouraged by them all. He had a blast.

The highlight of the regular season occurred in our only regular season victory. Score tied 0 - 0 early in the first period and the ball finds its way onto Michaels stick. This is his first ball hockey season and he has trouble controlling and shooting the ball, jumped up onto the netting above the boards, and was hooting and yelling the entire time. We all laughed and cheered him on, his positive energy was tons of fun.

Returning now to the last game of the playoffs. We go into overtime, Michael tossed his gear into the air and started cheering and hugging us all. Again lots of positive energy.

The league upgraded their championship trophy a couple of seasons back. It is now a mini-replica Stanley cup and the players names are engraved. Michael has talked about it all season. Talks about it like it is the actual Stanley cup, as a team we secretly decided that Michael was now our captain. He was excited to win the trophy, even more so to be named captain and be presented with the award by the league director. He hoisted it above his head, kissed it, ran around a bit. The whole time he was almost in tears as he talked about this being his dream and how amazing it was to be real.

The other team (remember mostly high school students), but this team of almost men changed. Prior to Michael lifting the cup, they were politely cheering. Once they saw how excited Michael was, they were cheering as loudly as our team, and their parents in the stands joined. It was Michaels celebration, and we were all witnesses to his happiness. This is one moment I will never forget, and whenever someone tells me that the next generation is lazy, etc

After the presentation of the trophy, so it went back to Michael and he would be victorious on our behalf. Team picture had Michael on the floor with the trophy between his legs (huge smile) and the team surrounding him. (I hope I can get a copy of that picture someday)

He carried the trophy into the dressing room and forgot everything else. Literally, but I wonder if he was so excited he just started to go home before he realised that he forgot his equipment and still had the trophy. 

He left shortly after he put the trophy down in the dressing room. He never stays long after games because his ride is ready and waiting. Michaels energy, and we played against high school students who are supposed to be in a different division), but everyone in attendance that evening had an awesome time due to Michael and his enthusiasm.

This is a picture of the trophy. Many pictures were taken of Michael lifting and even kissing the trophy. My camera was in the dressing room
